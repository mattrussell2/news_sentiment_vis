(AP Photo/Jim Mone)\n\nEAGAN, Minn. (AP) \u2014 The physical attributes Danielle Hunter has used to amass his league-leading total of 11\u00bd sacks this season are so ideal that some of his Minnesota Vikings teammates have taken to calling him \u201cCreate-A-Player,\u201d the feature on Madden NFL that allows gamers to concoct the seemingly perfect computerized prospect.\n\nHunter\u2019s 6-foot-5, 252-pound, muscle-bound frame and 4.57-second 40-yard dash time that led all defensive linemen at the combine in his draft year would already be a handful for opposing offenses, but the strides he\u2019s made over four seasons on the mental side of the game have helped turn him into one of the league\u2019s best defensive ends with just one week elapsed past his 24th birthday.\n\nMatthew Stafford was the latest quarterback with a too-close look at Hunter\u2019s dominance, when his 3\u00bd sacks and fumble return for a touchdown fueled a 24-9 victory for the Vikings on Sunday over the Detroit Lions.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s improved on just being reactive,\u201d Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said. \u201cA lot of young defensive linemen, especially because we harp on stopping the run, they\u2019re nervous about, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to take a chance here, because I think this is a play-action pass\u2019 or something like that. The thing I notice about Danielle, he just lets it rip now, and that\u2019s what makes him good.\u201d\n\nThe Jamaica-born Hunter, who settled in the Houston area with his family at age 8, was drafted by the Vikings in the third round out of LSU in 2015 after he ended an unheralded college career by skipping his final season of eligibility.\n\nHis length, speed and strength made him an obvious pro prospect , but there were league-wide concerns about his technique inconsistencies and tendency to let overthinking slow down his production. He had only 4\u00bd sacks over three years with the Tigers.\n\nThe Vikings, though, relied on analytics to peg Hunter as a potential star with the right coaching and scheme. They saw a note-taking and self-motivated player who they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about doing his part.\n\nStill six months shy of his 21st birthday when he was drafted, Hunter had plenty of time to grow. In 2016, he led all defensive ends in the NFL with 12\u00bd sacks and finished third overall.\n\nLast season, he overtook Brian Robison as the full-time starter opposite Everson Griffen. He signed a five-year contract extension this summer worth as much as $72 million with $40 million in guaranteed money and $15 million up front.\n\nWith 37 sacks in 55 games, Hunter has fast climbed the all-time Vikings lists. With just three more sacks over Minnesota\u2019s last seven games, he\u2019ll have the second-most in a player\u2019s first four seasons with the team behind Jared Allen.\n\nHunter is tied with Los Angeles Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald for the league lead with 13 tackles for loss and tied for eighth in the NFL with 15 quarterback hits. He had at least one sack in each of the five games Griffen missed earlier.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me alone. I\u2019ve got good teammates, a good defensive line again,\u201d Hunter said after the Vikings sacked Stafford a franchise-record 10 times . \u201cWe go out there, and we work together as a team.\u201d\n\nThe Vikings (5-3-1) eagerly entered their bye week with their well-decorated defense back on track following a couple of uncharacteristically soft performances over the first half of the schedule.\n\n\u201cWe had things that we had to fix. We just learned from what we had done, and then we went out there and just went to execute them,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cJust doing our jobs. Not trying to do selfish things out there.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the foundation of Zimmer\u2019s system, a disciplined approach to honoring the run, staying in the right pass-rush lanes and trusting nearby teammates to handle their responsibilities. This four-down-linemen scheme, though predicated on an ability to pressure the quarterback from all points, is not designed to produce high individual sack totals. Every once in a while, though, an in-the-zone performance such as the one Hunter had on Sunday comes around.\n\n\u201cSometimes you go out there,\u201d Hunter said, \u201cyou just know you\u2019re about to beat this guy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "SANTA ROSA, Calif.

The ambush was retaliation for Venezuela\u2019s arrest hours earlier of nine people in the group from Colombia, he said.\n\nPadrino Lopez didn\u2019t identified the group, but said the attack was another example of how Colombia\u2019s internal unrest has spilled across the border for 60 years, putting Venezuelans in danger.\n\nColombia\u2019s government has signed a peace deal with the country\u2019s largest guerrilla force, but other groups remain active and some renegades reject the peace deal.

(AP Photo/Mike McCarn)\n\nTAMPA, Fla. (AP) \u2014 It doesn\u2019t matter if Jameis Winston or Ryan Fitzpatrick is at quarterback for the Buccaneers. A porous defense keeps undermining Tampa Bay\u2019s chances of winning.\n\nThe Bucs (3-5) have lost five of six following a 2-0 start. Neither changing quarterbacks nor firing defensive coordinator Mike Smith has been an answer to ending a tailspin that\u2019s dropped the team into a familiar hole: last place in the NFC South, where they\u2019ve finished six of the last seven seasons.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the past equals the future,\u201d coach Dirk Koetter said after Sunday\u2019s 42-28 loss to the Carolina Panthers, a game the Bucs trailed 35-7 at one point. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play better football, more consistent football. We have to get off to better starts. We\u2019ve got to be in the hunt in (the) turnover battle.\u201d\n\nThe Bucs are first in the NFL in passing offense and second in total yards. But well as they\u2019ve moved the ball through eight games, they\u2019re just as bad defensively in allowing a league-high 275 points (34.4 per game) and ranking 30th among 32 teams against the pass.\n\nTo make matters worse, Tampa Bay hasn\u2019t forced a turnover in a club-record five consecutive games.\n\nWinston lost his starting job after throwing four interceptions two weeks ago. Fitzpatrick flourished early in the season filling in while Winston was serving a three-game suspension. However, in his last three starts the Bucs have been outscored 103-27 in the opening half.\n\nInconsistency on offense has been part of the problem. Shoddy defense has been a recurring theme, even in the games the Bucs have won.\n\nCarolina scored on five straight possessions during one stretch of the first half to build a 28-point lead. Fitzpatrick rallied the team within 35-28 in the fourth quarter before the Panthers put away the game.\n\nThe loss dropped the Bucs to 2-3 in games started by Fitzpatrick. Winston, who\u2019s thrown 10 interceptions in four games, is 1-2.\n\nA common denominator in Tampa Bay\u2019s three victories is the Bucs have played mostly with the lead and found a way to hold off New Orleans, Philadelphia and Cleveland late.\n\nIn the other five games \u2014 all losses \u2014 opponents have compiled double-digit leads in the first half, and the offense has spent the second half trying to make up ground.\n\nDefensive end Jason Pierre-Paul said players have to own the ineffectiveness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, but that\u2019s on the players. It\u2019s not on the coaches. It\u2019s on us, it\u2019s on me,\u201d Pierre-Paul said. \u201cI\u2019m tired of the coaches saying they have to take it because it\u2019s up to the players to play ball.\u201d\n\nKoetter said poor tackling was the primary culprit against the Panthers. Mistakes on offense and special teams contributed to falling by 28 in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cWe actually did start fast on defense,\u201d Koetter said Monday. \u201cOn those five straight drives where they scored, on three of those drives we put them in horrible field position with an interception, two sacks, a punt return and a fake punt.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick rallied the team from a big second-half deficit for the second straight week, only to fall short in the end, throwing for 243 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions.\n\nNot good enough to win, but encouraging enough the Koetter said the 35-year-old will start again Sunday at home against Washington.\n\n\u201cWe know we have the talent, it\u2019s just we can\u2019t keep digging ourselves in these holes, especially on the road,\u201d Fitzpatrick said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that there is an answer or a magical formula or anything; it\u2019s just frustrating right now to not play well and then play well in spurts,\u201d the quarterback added. \u201cWe\u2019re just not a very consistent team and not a consistent offense right now.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "WILSON, N.C.

Now they have two weeks to prepare before a trip to visit the Redskins on Nov. 18.\n\nFour of the team\u2019s wins during this streak have come by a touchdown or less, giving the Texans confidence in their ability to win close games.\n\n\u201cOur first two wins were overtime wins,\u201d J.J.

You continue to find a way to win while you work on those things. It is a lot better to work on them while you are winning than losing.\u201d\n\nThe Texans had a shakeup on offense last week when receiver Will Fuller was lost for the season with a torn knee ligament and they traded with Denver for star receiver Demaryius Thomas to take his place. Thomas had three receptions for 61 yards in his Houston debut, but had a false start, lined up in the wrong spot and looked lost on a drive in the fourth quarter, showing he has plenty of work to do to get up to speed before facing Washington.\n\nO\u2019Brien said his struggles were understandable considering he only had three days of practice to try and learn what he needed to know before Sunday\u2019s game.\n\n\u2033(We\u2019re) just continuing to try to coach him up on what we\u2019re doing offensively,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cNow, we can kind of take a step back and really go back into what we call the basic information, teach him the formations, teach him the routes, the protections, how the protections fit with the routes that he\u2019s running and things like that and the technique of the route.\u201d\n\nWhile Thomas gets acclimated in Houston, the Texans have been impressed with the development of big rookie tight end Jordan Thomas. The 6-foot-5, 280-pound Thomas, who was a sixth-round pick in this year\u2019s draft, has recently emerged as a great goal-line target. He\u2019s grabbed three short touchdowns in the past two games, adding another dimension to Houston\u2019s red zone offense, which struggled earlier this season.\n\n\u201cHe was a wide receiver and then as he got bigger, (former Mississippi State coach) Danny Mullen moved him closer to the ball and he became a tight end,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cNow, he\u2019s had to learn how to block against some of these defensive ends and outside backers and he\u2019s gotten better and better at that.\u201d\n\nThe Texans\u2019 big winning streak has coincided with long skids by both the Titans and Jaguars, who both have just three wins. The Jaguars have dropped four straight and the Titans have lost three in a row entering Monday\u2019s game against Dallas.\n\nThe Texans think the attitude they showed in getting through their early struggles will help them as they try to add to their streak after the bye.\n\n\u201cA team with grit, fight, one that can really overcome adversity, play good football in tough situations, take care of the football in critical situations, I think that\u2019s the kind of formula that you want to have going down the stretch, hopefully, playing in the playoffs,\u201d safety Tyrann Mathieu said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "North Carolina's Luke Maye (32) loses the ball while Mount Olive's Cameron Robinson defends during the first half of a college basketball exhibition game in Chapel Hill, N.C., Friday, Nov. 2, 2018.

Bill Self has another strong recruiting class, a preseason All-American in Memphis transfer Dedric Lawson and a No. 1 ranking.\n\nKentucky. Coach Cal has another roster full of future pros. He\u2019s also got Reid Travis, a grad transfer from Stanford who happens to be one of the nation\u2019s top players.\n\nGonzaga. The Zags broke through to the Final Four two years ago. They could be even better this year.\n\nDuke. Coach K outdid himself with this year\u2019s recruiting class with what could be three of the top five picks in the NBA draft.\n\nVirginia.

Expect even more from him now that the Boilermakers need him even more.\n\nLuke Maye, North Carolina. The player who hit the shot to send the Tar Heels to the Final Four in 2017 averaged a double-double last season and will be counted on even more this year.\n\nR.J. Barrett, Duke. The athletic freshman has yet to play a game but has already created a buzz and could be the No. 1 overall pick in next year\u2019s NBA draft.\n\nDedric Lawson, Kansas. The former Memphis forward gives the Jayhawks plenty of talent and experience on an otherwise young roster.\n\nEthan Happ, Wisconsin. The Badgers sure are glad this multitalented big man decided to withdraw from the NBA draft. Opponents will not be.\n\nCaleb Martin, Nevada. The do-everything forward\u2019s decision to return with twin brother Cody is a big reason the Wolf Pack are being mentioned as a Final Four team.\n\nMID-MAJOR MONSTERS\n\nNevada. The Muss bus is loaded with talent and is driving toward what could be the best season in program history.\n\nLoyola-Chicago. No way the Ramblers and Sister Jean will be overlooked again.\n\nWestern Kentucky. Top recruit Charles Bassey will push the Hilltoppers up the big hill.\n\nBuffalo. Bulls have five of their top six scorers back from a team that knocked off Arizona in the opening round of the NCAAs.\n\nMarshall. The Thundering Herd and coach Dan D\u2019Antoni are looking for an even deeper March run after knocking off Wichita State in the opening round of the NCAAs.\n\nFRESHMEN PHENOMS\n\nZion Williamson, Duke. Basket supports beware: One of the nation\u2019s top freshmen is a known rim wrecker.\n\nCam Reddish, Duke. Doesn\u2019t get the pub Barrett and Williamson get, but he\u2019s a legit top-five NBA prospect.\n\nRomeo Langford, Indiana. Locking up the state of Indiana\u2019s best player was a huge get for coach Archie Miller as he tries to get the Hoosiers back to national prominence.\n\nCharles Bassey, Western Kentucky. He eschewed the Power Five programs to stay in-state and could dominate Conference USA \u2014 and beyond.\n\nNassir Little, North Carolina. Long and athletic, he was a big get for coach Roy.\n\nBol Bol, Oregon. Manute\u2019s son can shoot inside, outside and swat shots, just like Pops.\n\nTOP NONCONFERENCE GAMES\n\nNo. 4 Duke vs. No. 2 Kentucky, Tuesday in Indianapolis. It will be a blue-blooded kickoff to the season.\n\nNo. 1 Kansas vs. No. 10 Michigan State, Tuesday in Indianapolis. The opening act in Indy isn\u2019t bad, either.\n\nNo. 19 Michigan at No. 9 Villanova, Nov. 14. Early season, title-game rematch? Yes, please.\n\nOhio State at Cincinnati, Wednesday. It finally happened, and hoops fans are the beneficiaries.\n\nMarquette at Indiana, Nov. 14. Marquette\u2019s Markus Howard vs. Indiana freshman Romeo Langford is worth it right there.\n\nArizona vs. No. 3 Gonzaga, Maui Invitational.

Drew wanted a pay raise to finish out the season and got one.\n\nDrew\u2019s new deal includes a team option for the 2019-20 season. If the Cavs choose not to retain him, Drew will receive a buyout payment.\n\n\u201cSo now there\u2019s clarity,\u201d Drew said Monday night before the Cavs lost 102-100 in Orlando to fall to 1-9 \u2014 0-5 on the road. \u201cThere\u2019s just no gray area, and because there\u2019s no gray area and me and my staff can just roll our sleeves up put all into helping this team be successful.\u201d\n\nDrew said he did not talk to the team about his future after this season.\n\n\u201cThe discussion we had was about moving forward with what we have and what we want to accomplish,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to do everything to put (rookie guard) Collin (Sexton) in a position to be successful.

(Jerry Larson/Waco Tribune-Herald via AP)\n\nSTILLWATER, Okla. (AP) \u2014 Mike Gundy is ready to take a fresh approach to Oklahoma State\u2019s penalty problem.\n\nThe coach said Monday he will consider benching players for committing bad penalties, an issue that\u2019s plagued the inconsistent Cowboys (5-4, 2-4 Big 12) all season and especially in a crushing 35-31 loss to Baylor on Saturday.\n\nOklahoma State had a season-high 12 penalties for 133 yards against the Bears, including three defensive flags in the fourth quarter that allowed Baylor to erase a 31-21 deficit in the final eight minutes. The Bears scored the winning touchdown with seven seconds left.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had that issue for the majority of the year,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more facemasks, more late hits, more 15-yard penalties, more chop blocks than I\u2019ve had in years, I would guess.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re not a good enough team to do that, to get away with that. It has been talked about, it has been preached, literally over 100 times that I\u2019ve said it over the last three months.\u201d\n\nOklahoma State has been flagged this season for 68 penalties and 699 yards \u2014 the latter is the ninth most out of 130 FBS schools. The only games this year when they\u2019ve had fewer than seven flags or 55 yards of penalties were their two signature victories, a 44-21 win over then-No. 17 Boise State (four penalties for 25 yards) and 38-35 over then-No. 6 Texas (four for 52).\n\nThe Cowboys have a shot at another marquee win when they visit No. 6 Oklahoma (8-1, 5-1) on Saturday. They are also one win shy of being bowl eligible for the 13th straight season.\n\nThe most damaging penalties against Baylor were a facemask and a personal foul for shoving the ball carrier once he was already out of bounds. That made it all the more exasperating for Gundy, the father of three teenage sons who says the time has come for tougher parenting on the sidelines.\n\n\u201cSaturday tells us we\u2019re not doing a good enough job coaching discipline and structure. There\u2019s different ways to do that,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cSome people spank their kids, some people put them in time out, some people ground them, some people take their phone \u2014 there\u2019s different ways to handle that, so we will address those issues.\u201d\n\nGundy said offending players could end up on the sidelines, even if it that means replacing them with less talented or experienced teammates.\n\n\u201cIf your best guys are on the field that give you your best chance to win, and they\u2019re not playing smart football and we\u2019re not getting any results, at some point, you\u2019ve got to say, \u2018Okay, if you\u2019re going to be selfish because you\u2019re taking away from the other 10 guys, then you\u2019re going to have to come over here and stand by us,\u2019\u201d Gundy said. \u201cAnd then we have to put a guy in that may be less experienced or maybe not as athletic, so you really hurt the whole team, but I really don\u2019t know what other options we\u2019re faced with at this particular time, because what I\u2019ve been doing is not working.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

A federal judge in July had issued a preliminary injunction but ordered Planned Parenthood to continue trying to find a contracting physician.\n\nMonday\u2019s joint filing said Planned Parenthood found a physician willing to contract with it.\n\n\u2033(Planned Parenthood is) therefore currently in compliance with the contracted physician requirement, and the parties move to vacate the preliminary injunction as moot and dismiss the appeal,\u201d the filing said.\n\nPlanned Parenthood had argued Arkansas\u2019 restriction would have made the state the first in the nation to effectively ban abortion pills. Arkansas had argued the law was needed to protect women from any complications from the abortion pills. But Planned Parenthood argued that such complications are rare, and that those complications can be handled by hospitals without contacting the group\u2019s physicians.\n\n\u201cThe removal of the preliminary injunction will allow Arkansas law to take effect, ensuring that women have access to reliable emergency health care following complications associated with medication abortions,\u201d Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said in a statement. \u201cAfter challenging this requirement for three years and claiming it could not comply, Planned Parenthood has finally agreed to follow this common-sense law.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood had previously been unable to find any Arkansas obstetricians willing to handle hospital admissions, and said many doctors cited a fear of being harassed over an association with an abortion provider, objections from employers or a personal opposition to abortion.\n\nPlanned Parenthood administers pills to end pregnancies at its clinics in Fayetteville and Little Rock, but does not perform surgical abortions. Bettina Brownstein, an attorney for Planned Parenthood, said the physician is also contracting with a third facility in Little Rock not affiliated with the organization that administers the pills and also performs surgical abortions.\n\nBrownstein said finding a physician doesn\u2019t alleviate the concerns Planned Parenthood raised about the restriction, which was approved by state\u2019s Republican legislature and governor in 2015.\n\n\u201cAfter three years of searching, we were finally able to comply with this medically unnecessary requirement,\u201d Brandon J. Hill, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a statement. \u201cAlthough we believe this restriction does nothing to protect the health of Arkansans, we remain devoted to providing comprehensive reproductive health care to our patients, including safe, legal abortion no matter what.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo", "", "", "Democratic Senate candidate Kyrsten Sinema, left, high-fives an Arizona State student who said she voted for her on the Arizona State University campus in Tempe on Monday, Nov. 5, 2018.

Doug Ducey on down, as she tried to remind Arizona Republicans to continue their decade-long stint of winning every statewide race.\n\n\u201cYou guys are my wingmen and my wingwomen,\u201d McSally, a former combat pilot, said to supporters at a stop in Flagstaff. \u201cAnd the only way we\u2019re going to get victory tomorrow is if everybody digs deep, everybody does their part.

That\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nJoseph, however, staunchly defended his decision-making on the second one when he decided not to risk Case Keenum getting sacked again after the Broncos had crossed the Houston 35-yard line with about 40 seconds left.\n\nPhillip Lindsay ran up the middle for minus-1 yard and then Denver called timeout with three seconds left.\n\n\u201cI have no problem with how we handled that situation,\u201d Joseph said.\n\nHowever, McManus is much more accurate from inside of 50 yards than outside.\n\nHe\u2019s 23 of 30 in his career between 40 and 49 yards for a 77 percent clip.\n\nFrom 50-plus yards, he\u2019s just 13 of 25 for a 52 percent success rate.\n\n\u201cOur field-goal line was the 35-yard line. We got to the 33,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cSo, at that point, yardage-wise we were good. Obviously, with that pass rush, I wasn\u2019t going to drop back again and allow (Whitney) Mercilus, (Jadeveon) Clowney and (J.J.) Watt to hit the quarterback and the ball\u2019s on the turf and now we lose the game.\n\n\u201cSo, my thought process was we have the yards we need. Let\u2019s try to pop a run and get five or six more yards and kick the field goal and win the game. But I wasn\u2019t going to expose our quarterback and our O-line to that pass rush one more time and now if they make a play, now we\u2019re all idiots, right?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy Monday morning to say that wasn\u2019t right.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Associated Press will debut a new survey of the nation\u2019s electorate for Tuesday\u2019s midterms that aims to more accurately capture the story of how Americans voted and why.\n\nThe launch of AP VoteCast is the largest change in the way final information about voters\u2019 choices is collected by media organizations since CBS News first conducted an exit poll in 1972. The AP\u2019s leaders say their decision to break away from the traditional exit polls is rooted in longstanding concerns about the accuracy of those surveys.\n\n\u201cThese results will be scrutinized and analyzed by academicians in the months after the midterms,\u201d Gary Pruitt, CEO of The Associated Press, said of the seven-figure project. \u201cAnd so, the tale will be told.\u201d\n\nVoteCast is conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for AP and Fox News. Both AP and Fox were members of the National Election Pool that has for decades conducted the exit poll.\n\nThe remaining members of the pool \u2014 CNN, ABC, CBS and NBC \u2014 will again rely on an exit poll conducted by Edison Research. Several other major news organizations, such as The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, will use VoteCast.\n\nThe most significant difference between the two is in how voters are surveyed.\n\nUnder AP\u2019s system, postcards are mailed to a random sample of registered voters in 25 states, inviting them to take a survey either online or by phone. At the same time, a random-sample survey of registered voters nationwide is conducted using a panel designed to be representative of the U.S. population. Finally, VoteCast surveys self-identified registered voters in all 50 states using opt-in online panels.\n\nThose who take the survey are asked if they have, in fact, voted or are sure to.\n\nAP believes its methodology will more accurately reflect the makeup of an electorate that increasingly does not vote on Election Day. In 2016, more than 40 percent of Americans voted early, absentee or by mail. It will also capture the opinions of registered voters who choose not to cast ballots.\n\nJoe Lenski, co-founder of Edison Research, said the strength of its exit polling hinges on the fact that it is conducted with people as they are leaving polling places.\n\n\u201cWithout doing that, there\u2019s no way to confirm that people actually voted,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, news organizations have long held concerns about the accuracy of exit polls, which have in recent years tended to overstate Democrats. In 2016, for example, they incorrectly suggested early on election night that Hillary Clinton would defeat Donald Trump.\n\nAP Executive Editor Sally Buzbee said that as the actual vote started coming in and it became clear Trump was headed toward victory, she directed the newsroom\u2019s race call team to disregard results from the exit polls. AP accurately called the race for Trump before any other major news outlet.\n\n\u201cIt was a very sobering moment that told me that we needed to try to see if we could use an alternative going forward,\u201d said Buzbee, who was AP\u2019s Washington bureau chief at the time.\n\nAfter the election, the AP and NORC spent more than a year designing a new, nonpartisan method for sampling a bigger slice of the American public.\n\nWorking in close collaboration with Fox News, the product\u2019s first customer, AP tested this approach in the 2017 gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia, and in the Alabama special election for U.S. Senate. At poll close, the surveys accurately forecast the winners and their final vote shares.\n\nOn Nov. 6, VoteCast will be used in all 47 states that have statewide elections, including all races for Senate and governor and states with only one House district, such as Alaska. AP says about 122,000 Americans will be surveyed by phone and online.\n\nEdison says its survey will sample 100,000 people.\n\nThe rubber meets the road when the results of the traditional exit polls and VoteCast are made public and compared. News outlets will make expensive post-Nov. 6 decisions about whom to trust ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nDavid Lauter, Washington Bureau Chief for The Los Angeles Times, said his news organization opted for a four-figure contract for VoteCast\u2019s results only in California in 2018, and the Times\u2019 writers will base their analyses on those. But he said that since the exit poll consortium\u2019s results will be public, he\u2019ll also be comparing their accuracy with VoteCast.\n\n\u201cOur thinking was, this is a different way of doing it. The old method clearly has flaws. Let\u2019s give this a try and see how it works,\u201d Lauter said.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://www.ap.org/votecast\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Culinary Union members cheer as they rally in support of Rep.

(AP) \u2014 The No. 5 Georgia Bulldogs are firmly focused on a team from Alabama.\n\nNo, not the mighty Crimson Tide.\n\nAfter locking up a spot in the Southeastern Conference championship game for the second year in a row, Georgia briefly celebrated but quickly turned its attention to Saturday night\u2019s game against Auburn, the 122nd meeting in the Deep South\u2019s oldest rivalry.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not anybody on our team that\u2019s going to be worrying about anything but Auburn,\u201d coach Kirby Smart said Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s the next task at hand. That\u2019s what we have to be focused on. Our goal is to play the next team, whoever the next team is, and we try not to have real big highs and no real big lows. We want to stay neutral, right in the middle.\u201d\n\nThe Bulldogs will get another shot at the team they faced in last year\u2019s national championship game. Top-ranked Alabama, which hasn\u2019t been seriously challenged this season, locked up the SEC West title with another dominating win, 29-0 over LSU .\n\nBoth Alabama (9-0, 7-0 SEC) and Georgia (8-1, 6-1) are heavily favored to win their remaining regular-season games, which would set them up for de facto playoff game with the SEC title on the line Dec. 1 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta \u2014 the same spot where they played their classic title game almost 10 months ago.\n\nIn that one, the Crimson Tide switched quarterbacks at halftime, overcame a pair of 13-point deficits and pulled out a stunning 26-23 victory in overtime . After Georgia settled for a field goal on its first possession of the extra period, Tua Tagovailoaio threw a 41-yard touchdown pass to DeVonta Smith on second-and-26 to win the game.\n\nWhile the Bulldogs are certainly eager to get another crack at Alabama, no one wants to talk about that matchup.\n\nNot yet, anyway.\n\nClearly, the four players made available to the media on Monday had been coached up to talk only about Auburn (6-3, 3-3).\n\n\u201cWe clinched the East \u2014 that\u2019s great. Now it\u2019s back to work,\u201d defensive end Jonathan Ledbetter said. \u201cWe\u2019re back to the drawing board getting ready for this week. We\u2019re not worried about anything down the line except Auburn.\u201d\n\nOne reporter pressed defensive back J.R. Reed even more, asking if there was ever a time he \u201cdaydreamed\u201d about facing Alabama.\n\n\u201cDo you daydream about Alabama?\u201d Reed joked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to play \u2019em,\u201d the reporter replied.\n\nReed chuckled.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t daydream about Alabama at all,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, they\u2019re on our schedule now. But we\u2019re worried about Auburn.\u201d\n\nGeorgia locked up the East with an impressive 34-17 victory at No. 12 Kentucky , completing another perfect run through the division side of its schedule.\n\nHo-hum.\n\nThat\u2019s merely the first of several items on the Bulldogs\u2019 checklist.\n\n\u201cThere was a little celebration,\u201d Reed said, \u201cbut we know that winning the East doesn\u2019t mean that much.\u201d\n\nGeorgia opened as a 14-point favorite over Auburn, which is coming off one of the better performances of a disappointing season. The Tigers rallied from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to knock off Texas A&M 28-24 \u2014 and an upset of the Bulldogs would really give 2018 a whole new perspective.\n\nThese long-time rivals are certainly familiar with each other. This met twice a year ago, with Auburn romping to a 40-17 victory late in the regular season before Georgia bounced back with a dominating 28-7 triumph in the SEC championship game.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got two good football teams playing against each other, competing and playing their hearts out,\u201d Ledbetter said. \u201cIt\u2019s a physical game, always. It\u2019s one of my favorite games of the season, so I\u2019m looking forward to it. I\u2019m always looking forward to a challenge.\u201d\n\nAn even bigger challenge is still to come.\n\nBut all that talk about a rematch with Alabama will have to wait.\n\n\u201cEvery week we have to come with the same approach,\u201d offensive lineman Andrew Thomas said. \u201cWe have to win out the rest of the way to be where we want to be.\u201d\n\nNotes: Smart gave optimistic updates on a trio of players who left the Kentucky game with injuries. WR Mecole Hardman (ankle) should be able to practice all week and be ready to go against Auburn, while center Lamont Gaillard (hyperextended knee) is also expected to play though he will be limited at the beginning of the week. Freshman offensive lineman Cade Mays (stinger) was restricted to non-contact drills Monday and his status is still to be determined. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough kid, and we know he\u2019ll push through it,\u201d Smart said. ... Another ailing offensive lineman, Ben Cleveland, is closing to returning from a broken fibula sustained against Missouri.

(AP) \u2014 When the season started for the Arizona Cardinals, Sam Bradford was the quarterback and Mike McCoy was offensive coordinator.\n\nNow both are gone.\n\nOn Saturday, while the team was enjoying a long weekend off, the Cardinals released Bradford, who lost his starting job after three games to rookie Josh Rosen and had been inactive for the last five. Bradford\u2019s departure came a little less than two weeks after McCoy was fired and replaced by quarterbacks coach Byron Leftwich.\n\nCoach Steve Wilks said Monday that in releasing Bradford \u201cwe did what we thought was best for the team. We needed that position to be able to add quality depth at different positions.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals made several roster moves during their bye week. Last week, they signed tight end John Phillips and offensive lineman Colby Gossett. Gossett was signed off the Minnesota practice squad. On Monday, Arizona signed offensive lineman Zack Golditch from the Indianapolis practice squad. The team also re-signed wide receiver Kendall Wright, who had a 10-day stint with the team in October.\n\nArizona was looking to add depth on the offensive line even though all five starters might be healthy enough to play Sunday at Kansas City. John Wetzel, a backup at both tackle and guard, was placed on injured reserve Saturday with a neck injury.\n\nRight guard Justin Pugh said he is hoping his broken hand will be healed enough for him to play Sunday, which would be four weeks from the day he injured it.\n\nThe Cardinals (2-6) are coming off a come-from-behind win over San Francisco but face a much more daunting challenge against the Chiefs (8-1), who opened as 15-point favorites with the advantage moving to 16 \u00bd points on Monday.\n\n\u201cDynamic in every area,\u201d Wilks said of the Chiefs, \u201cparticularly on the offensive side of the ball.

A workout had been scheduled for last Wednesday but Wilks cancelled it.\n\n\u201cA lot of injuries, I wanted to be able to give the guys an opportunity to recover,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the long weekend, Arizona got an extra day of practice this week. Players have Tuesday off before returning to their regular Wednesday-Thursday-Friday practice schedule.\n\nIt gives Leftwich a little extra time to work on the offense, which slogged through three quarters before Rosen threw two TD passes in the fourth-quarter in the 18-15 win over San Francisco.\n\n\u201cI think it was very beneficial,\u201d Wilks said. \u201cI\u2019m out there, and I\u2019m watching the flow of practice. I\u2019m seeing it in action with Josh and the things that they\u2019re doing.

The Haines Economic Development Corp. met about the timber sale on Oct. 19. HEDC Executive Director Margaret Friedenauer told the corporation\u2019s board that, while it\u2019s unknown whether the Haines timber sale is being affected by Chinese tariffs, tariffs had affected a proposed sale in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, according to the Chilkat Valley News.\n\nOn Oct. 19, the Anchorage Daily News reported that \u201ca log export deal that promised to bring up to $1 million a year to the foundering Mat-Su port is on hold indefinitely.\u201d\n\nAnd what was a primary reason that the 24,000-acre Mat-Su Borough timber sale has been suspended? Chinese tariffs on the logs that would be trucked to Port MacKenize and shipped on to China, according to the ADN.\n\nThe Chinese tariffs have been imposed in response to the U.S. administration\u2019s imposition of tariffs on certain types of Chinese goods, according to ADN, citing several reports.\n\nThe Mat-Su timber deal involved a partnership of entities in China, New Zealand and Washington state, according to the Anchorage Daily News. The group had taken notice of the tariffs\u2019 effect on market prices, said Eric Oien, who owns the Denali Timber Management entity that\u2019s involved in the enterprise.\n\n\u201cThe market prices dropped very severely due to the tariffs, so our group all made the collective decision that we can no long harvest this timber without incurring siginificant losses,\u201d Oien told the Chilkat Valley News.\n\nSo, the trade war tariff fight between the U.S. and China has affected one timber-harvest opportunity in Alaska directly, and looks to potentially affect another. In Haines, the potential effect is on a 10-year sale. Ten years of economic activity. Ten years of jobs.\n\nWho knows what the tariff landscape will look like when field work on the Haines sale contract resumes next spring.\n\nFor the Mat-Su project, Oien told the Anchorage Daily News that there continues to be interest, passion and appreciation, but \u201cwe\u2019re in a suspended position, meaning there\u2019s an unexpected abrupt market disruption that we\u2019re essentially waiting out.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve been questioning the strategy of starting trade wars. Now that we appear to be in one, the implications have become clearer. Suspended positions and unexpected abrupt market disruptions affecting Alaska timber; a slew of rising costs elsewhere. What was once hypothetical or downplayed as inconsequential is becoming real. Carve outs (some types of Alaska salmon) and pay-offs (farm producers) are mitigating some of the damage, but raise the question of equal treatment across sectors.\n\nNow comes word on Monday that the U.S. is planning another round of tariffs against all remaining Chinese goods.\n\nWe\u2019ve been told that trade wars are \u201ceasy\u201d to win. We\u2019d like to find the dictionary that defines \u201ceasy\u201d as anything close to what\u2019s happening now.\n\n___\n\nNov. 2, 2018\n\nFairbanks Daily News-Miner: DEC wise to include stakeholders in air-quality planning\n\nThe Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation is now in charge of regulating air quality in the nonattainment areas of the Fairbanks North Star Borough. This is a result of the voters approving the Home Heating Reclamation Act, or Proposition 4, on Oct. 2.\n\nThe authority to regulate air quality has changed hands, but the challenge remains the same: PM 2.5 still poses numerous health risks, especially for the young and elderly. Woodburning remains a way of life for many, for some it\u2019s an economic necessity, and that makes it an emotional issue for many. However, air quality will not improve without community effort.\n\nThe potential passage of Proposition 4 had been on DEC\u2019s radar for quite some time, so when the initiative passed, DEC was ready to take control. It seems the DEC has hit the ground running.\n\nThe DEC will now issue air-quality alerts. It will use the same methodology the borough used to determine whether alerts and burn bans are needed. The main difference? State employees who will be communicating air-quality information. The DEC does not have the personnel to make phone calls when violations are made, so letters will be sent. Those letters escalate from warnings to notice of violations. Denise Koch, director of the DEC\u2019s Division of Air Quality, said fines will be levied if necessary, but the DEC has no incentive to do so because none of that money comes back to the department. Any fines collected return to the state\u2019s general fund.\n\nThe borough\u2019s Air Quality Division will still operate the woodstove changeout program. It will also continue to provide education materials about air quality and PM 2.5.\n\nCould the Environmental Protection Agency take charge of regulation? It is possible but unlikely. Suzanne Skadowski, an EPA spokeswoman, said the agency could take over regulation but there is no benchmark or milestone of ineptitude that would require the EPA to step in.\n\nWhat is a very real possibility is the EPA placing sanctions on the borough to keep it from receiving federal highway dollars and requiring 2:1 energy offsets. Butte County, California, and East Helena, Montana, are two communities so sanctioned with the aforementioned penalties.\n\nThe best way to avoid sanctions is to work with the DEC in developing a serious State Implementation Plan. The due date for submitting a plan \u2014 which details how the borough will attain air quality goals \u2014 is Dec. 31, 2019.\n\nThe DEC will continue to work on background documentation for the SIP. In the meantime, it will continue to work with the Air Quality Stakeholders group. The DEC has had a representative at each stakeholders meeting. Ms. Koch has been \u201cthrilled\u201d with the stakeholders group.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to finalize control strategies (for the SIP) until we hear from the stakeholders. We\u2019re really interested to hear what they say,\u201d Ms. Koch said in a Thursday phone interview.\n\nThe DEC is right to include the stakeholders group in developing the SIP, because it ensures that the community is on board with the plan, making compliance a realistic endeavor.\n\nTo learn more about how the DEC will enforce air-quality rules and sign up for air-quality alerts, visit dec.alaska.gov/fnsbair.", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to fast-track cases on the president\u2019s decision to end a program that shields young immigrants from deportation.\n\nThe administration on Monday asked the Supreme Court to take up three cases about Trump\u2019s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA.

Sophomore Marquez Bimage, who replaced Hager against West Virginia, has a dislocated shoulder and won\u2019t play.\n\nHager, Davis and Bimage all left the game in the first half. Jones didn\u2019t play at all after hurting himself before the game at the team hotel.\n\nTexas had virtually no pass rush against West Virginia. The Longhorns regularly dropped eight into coverage, and had no sacks or quarterback pressures as defensive end Charles Omenihu couldn\u2019t get to quarterback Will Grier by himself without Hager drawing attention on the other side.\n\nThe secondary that was missing Jones and Davis gave up West Virginia touchdown passes of 60, 33 and 18 yards. Texas allowed a 55-yard touchdown run, too, helped by bad tackling angles. The Mountaineers\u2019 2-point conversion came when linebacker Jeffrey McCulloch, who was lined up to help in pass coverage, broke inside when Grier turned to run. Grier easily trotted to the corner while McCulloch was caught up in a wash of blockers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing a bit tentative, for whatever reason is behind it,\u201d Herman said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t cut it loose at times, that\u2019s on us to figure out why ... We have to make sure we are playing with a lot more discipline.\u201d\n\nTexas\u2019 three losses this season have come by a total of nine points. The Longhorns also haven\u2019t lost three in a row in two seasons so far under Herman. And Texas hasn\u2019t lost at Texas Tech since 2008 when Michael Crabtree\u2019s touchdown catch with 1 second left ended Texas\u2019 unbeaten streak and cost the Longhorns a shot at the Big 12 championship.\n\nAfter losing two in a row, Texas needs help to get to this season\u2019s league title game. The Longhorns still have a share of second place and could still get there.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve shown progress,\u201d Herman said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody who\u2019s watched us the last two years, or watched this program the last five or six, that would argue that we (haven\u2019t) made substantial progress.\u201d\n\nA longer losing streak would mar a season that saw Texas rocket back into the top 10 for the first time since 2010. Just two weeks ago, Longhorns dared even to dream about an outside shot at the College Football Playoff.\n\n\u201cThe big picture is irrelevant. We\u2019ve got to make progress this week,\u201d Herman said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Jim Vertuno at https://twitter.com/jimvertuno", "LEAVENWORTH, Kan.

(AP) \u2014 Coach Dan Quinn says losing six starters to injured reserve never forced him to lose faith in the Atlanta Falcons, even before three straight wins revived the team\u2019s playoff hopes.\n\nThe Falcons (4-4) have recovered from a 1-4 start despite losing both starting safeties, both first-team offensive guards, running back Devonta Freeman and linebacker Deion Jones.\n\nSunday\u2019s 38-14 win at NFC East-leading Washington showed the Falcons, who play at Cleveland this week, are back as a playoff contender.\n\nEven after running back Devonta Freeman and right guard Brandon Fusco were the most recent starters to land on IR, Quinn continued to say the Falcons were a team on the rise who had not peaked.\n\n\u201cAll along I\u2019ve had real belief in what this \u201918 team can be,\u201d Quinn said Monday. \u201cAlthough it started under some difficult circumstances, I like the way they\u2019ve supported each other. I like the toughness they\u2019ve shown and I feel like we\u2019re starting to play like we\u2019re capable of playing.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons iced the win over the Redskins by holding the ball for 10 minutes in the fourth quarter, when Washington didn\u2019t score. Quinn said the \u201cability to finish\u201d was a highlight of the game.\n\nWith Ben Garland starting for Fusco and Wes Schweitzer continuing in his fill-in starting role for injured left guard Andy Levitre, the new-look offensive line played one of its best games.\n\nThe Falcons converted 10 of 13 third-down plays and scored touchdowns on two of three red-zone possessions. Matt Ryan threw for 350 yards with four touchdowns and one interception \u2014 only his third of the season and his first since a Week 2 win over Carolina.\n\nRyan said the Falcons have improved since losing four of their first five games.\n\n\u201cI think halfway through we were a better football team than we were at the start, and we have to keep it trending in that direction,\u201d Ryan said after Sunday\u2019s game.\n\nRyan has enjoyed a return to his 2016 form, when he was named the NFL MVP. Led by Ryan, the Falcons have scored touchdowns on 17 of their last 21 red-zone possessions since their opening loss at Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cI think red zone efficiency has been really good for us,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do a good job of that in the opener, but since then we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of that. ... When you\u2019re scoring touchdowns and taking care of the ball, that\u2019s a good recipe for success.\u201d\n\nQuinn said seeing Julio Jones finally score his first touchdown of the season \u201cwas probably the coolest part of the day\u201d in the win over Washington.\n\nJones\u2019 teammates rushed down the sideline to celebrate with him following his 35-yard touchdown pass from Ryan.\n\n\u201cIt was a great experience having the team come out there,\u201d Jones said.\n\nQuinn said Jones \u201cis the most selfless leader probably that any of us have been around.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were so excited for him because of all the work he does behind the scenes that people don\u2019t know about,\u201d Quinn said. \u201d...

Alabama won 29-0. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 LSU coach Ed Orgeron proclaimed that Monday was his \u201cbiggest day\u201d on the job since he took over the Les Miles in 2016.\n\nThe coach expressed concerned about the psyche of his players after the dual blow of losing big at home to No. 1 Alabama and then hearing their own coach say after the game that he needs to bring in better recruits.\n\n\u201cI told that to my coaches in a staff meeting this morning, \u2018We are the mature people. We have to bring the players up. I have to be at my best today,\u2019\u201d Orgeron said. \u201cThere are a lot of hurt people on our football team. We have the 24-hour rule. It may take a little longer to get over this loss.\u201d\n\nLosses to Alabama tend to be emotional. The Crimson Tide has tormented the Tigers for generations \u2014 first for decades under coach Paul \u201cBear\u201d Bryant and now under Nick Saban, a former LSU coach who has won five national championships with the Crimson Tide.\n\nAlabama has won eight straight against the Tigers, starting with a victory in the national championship game at the end of the 2011 season, ruining what would have otherwise been the finest campaign in LSU history.\n\nThe latest loss to Alabama \u2014 by a score of 29-0 \u2014 ended LSU\u2019s hopes of reaching the Southeastern Conference championship game and dropped the Tigers from fourth to ninth in the AP Top 25 Poll .\n\nOrgeron was critical of LSU\u2019s offensive and defensive linemen immediately after the game, saying essentially that they currently were not good enough to win crucial matchups at the line of scrimmage against Alabama.\n\nOn Monday, Orgeron backed off that assessment to some extent.\n\n\u201cWe must coach better and that starts with me,\u201d Orgeron said. \u201cWe could\u2019ve put guys in better position. Our schemes could have been better. We need to execute better. We must be better on the offensive and defensive lines. We must improve our depth and increase the number of quality players there.\u201d\n\nNo offensive or defensive lineman met with the media Monday. Linebacker Devin White indicated that he would not be bothered by criticism from a coach.\n\n\u201cWhen a coach criticizes me, I respect him,\u201d White said. \u201cThe coach is in a higher authority. He has been around the game. I take (criticism) as a building tool and embrace it.\n\n\u201cI will tell the coach, \u2018You say that I didn\u2019t do this good. Then, coach me better so I can do those things.\u2019 Football is a hard game. If a player is not all about getting better, then he shouldn\u2019t play the game.\u201d\n\nThe Tigers should find themselves in a prestigious New Year\u2019s Six Bowl game if they can close the regular season with three victories, starting Saturday at Arkansas.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I am going to tell the players is block out the noise,\u201d Orgeron said. \u201cI have a very good relationship with the players. We\u2019ll address some things and we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nUnder Orgeron, the Tigers have never lost back-to-back games. LSU has handily defeated Arkansas the week after a loss to Alabama each of the last two years. The Tigers beat the Razorbacks 38-10 in Fayetteville in 2016 and 33-10 in Baton Rouge in 2017.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to prepare the same way this week,\u201d Orgeron said. \u201cWe have to be mentally tough. We have a lot to play for. We know where we want to go and where we want to finish. We\u2019re 7-2 and have a chance at an excellent season. We see that as motivation.\u201d\n\nLSU may be out of the running for a berth in the College Football Playoffs, but it still controls its destiny as regards getting a spot in a New Year\u2019s Six Bowl game. The Tigers should be among the top 11 Power Five conference teams when the CFP standings are announced Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIf we win our next three games, we\u2019ll be 10-2,\u201d quarterback Joe Burrow said. \u201cIf I told you at the start of the season we\u2019d be 10-2, you would have told me that I was crazy.

He said we\u2019re doing pretty good but he needs more. We need to lead the league in effort and we\u2019re not doing that as rookies. ... It was a wake-up call and we answered.\u201d\n\nLittle has gone right of late for the Raiders, who have been outscored by 85 points during a four-game losing streak. The team has also cut captains Bruce Irvin and Derrick Johnson during that span, watched cornerback Dominque Rodgers-Cromartie retire, and traded receiver Amari Cooper to Dallas for a first-round draft pick.\n\nThat follows the trade one week before the start of the season that dealt star pass rusher Khalil Mack to Chicago for a package of picks, including two first-rounders.\n\nOakland was last in the league with seven sacks before cutting ties with Irvin, who led the team with three. Only rookies Maurice Hurst (two sacks) and Key (one), along with Clinton McDonald (one) have sacks among players on the active roster.\n\nThat\u2019s why Gruden wants more from his rookie class that also features defensive tackle P.J.

He was traded to New England in 2017, got cut by the Patriots and then signed with the New York Jets, where he had one sack in 15 games.\n\nEaly spent training camp in Dallas before getting cut by the Cowboys on Sept. 1.\n\nSmith was originally signed as an undrafted free agent in 2012 and finally got his first chance to play in 2014 with Tampa Bay. He had 13 1/2 sacks in 27 games his first two seasons with the Buccaneers before suffering a major knee injury in 2016.\n\nSmith has played just seven games the past three seasons with Tampa, Detroit and Arizona, recording three tackles and no sacks in seven games. Smith was released by Arizona in September.\n\nSmith worked out for the Raiders in recent weeks and got the call Sunday, a day after Irvin was released. Smith said he feels as healthy as he has since before the injury and is eager for the chance to show what he can do.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been very frustrating,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, I have a ton of confidence in myself.

The U.S. Olympic Committee is moving to revoke USA Gymnastics' status as the governing body for the sport at the Olympic level, meting out the nuclear option to an organization that has botched its own reorganization in the wake of a sex-abuse scandal involving former team doctor Larry Nassar. The organization, even with a newly constructed board of directors, made repeated mistakes after the revelations Nassar molested Olympians while working as a volunteer. They included the botched hiring of a program coordinator and an interim CEO to replace Perry, who lasted less than a year on the job. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)\n\nThe U.S. Olympic Committee took steps Monday to decertify USA Gymnastics as the governing body for the sport at the Olympic level, choosing to pursue the nuclear option for an organization that botched its own rebuilding attempt in the wake of a sex-abuse scandal involving former team doctor Larry Nassar.\n\nIn an open letter to the gymnastics community, USOC CEO Sarah Hirshland said \u201cyou deserve better,\u201d and that the challenges facing USA Gymnastics are more than it is capable of overcoming as currently constructed.\n\nThe USOC itself also has faced criticism for not responding quickly and appropriately to sex abuse cases, and though the move was cheered by the gymnast whose own revelations helped propel Nassar\u2019s years of abuse to the fore \u2014 \u201cTHANK YOU,\u201d tweeted Rachel Denhollander \u2014 others viewed it as a ploy to shift blame for the scandal.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement by USOC seeks only to deflect from their total failure over decades to protect the gymnasts in their care,\u201d said a statement from attorneys Michelle Simpson Tuegel and Mo Aziz, who represent Olympian Tasha Schwikert and her sister, Jordan, in their lawsuit against USAG and the USOC.\n\nEarlier this year, the USOC said it was seeking to remove itself as a defendant from a number of lawsuits \u2014 including those filed by gold medalists McKayla Maroney, Jordyn Wieber and Aly Raisman \u2014 claiming Nassar never worked for the federation, nor were his crimes foreseeable by the USOC. The lawsuits claim the USOC, as the umbrella organization that oversees USA Gymnastics, should have done more when it learned of the abuse.\n\nIt did push for new leadership at USA Gymnastics, but even with a new board of directors that started in June, the organization made repeated mistakes while dealing with the aftermath of revelations that the now-imprisoned Nassar molested Olympians while working as a volunteer. Those included the botched hiring of a program coordinator and an interim CEO to replace Kerry Perry, who lasted barely nine months on the job after the USOC forced out Steve Penny.\n\nThe announcement comes only days after the U.S. team brought home nine medals from the World Championships in the first major meet in the lead-up to Tokyo in 2020. Five of those were individual medals won by Olympic champion Simone Biles, who is among the athletes who have not hesitated to criticize the organization.\n\nBy moving to decertify USA Gymnastics, the USOC is taking major action against an organization that never grasped control over its own rebuilding. But the move could also leave a void that cannot be easily filled. In addition to supporting elite and Olympic athletes, and selecting teams and coaches for international competitions, USA Gymnastics serves more than 150,000 athletes in 3,000 clubs around the country. There is no other organization standing by to fill that need.\n\n\u201cSeeking to revoke recognition is not a decision that we have come to easily, but I believe it is the right action,\u201d Hirshland said. \u201cIn the short-term, we will work to ensure that America\u2019s gymnasts have the support necessary to excel on and off the field of play. We are building plans to do just that no matter the outcome of the revocation process.\u201d\n\nThe federal law that governs the USOC gives the federation final say on which organizations represent each sport at the Olympics, and also establishes a process to decertify the organizations. But that process is used only under the most extreme circumstances. One example came in 1994 when the USOC recommended decertifying the NRA as the governing body for shooting, and the NRA accepted the decision. The USOC also has dictated changes and placed its own administrators in charge of smaller NGBs in need of overhauls. The USOC could take a major role in shaping, even possibly running, whatever agency takes USA Gymnastics\u2019 place.\n\nHirshland said she has given USA Gymnastics the option of surrendering its recognition voluntarily, though there was no indication of which direction USAG would go. It issued a statement saying it was looking at the USOC letter \u201cand is evaluating the best path forward for our athletes, professional members, the organization and staff.\u201d\n\nThe statement detailed the challenges the new board has faced since taking over in June.\n\nIt is in search of its fourth president and CEO in the last 19 months thanks to a series of resignations, all of them under pressure from the USOC or the gymnastics\u2019 community at large.\n\nPenny \u2014 named as a co-defendant in several civil lawsuits filed by former elite gymnasts\u2014 stepped down in March 2017. He was arrested last month and charged with destroying or hiding documents related to Nassar\u2019s activities at the Karolyi Ranch, the ex-national training center near Huntsville, Texas, where a number of gymnasts said Nassar abused them.\n\nThe organization named Perry as Penny\u2019s replacement but her tenure lasted barely nine months. She was criticized by several high-profile gymnasts, Biles included, for failing to offer a clear vision on the way forward and quit in September.\n\nHer resignation came shortly after the hiring, then quick removal, of Mary Lee Tracy as elite development coordinator; Tracy had been supportive of Nassar when the allegations first surfaced.\n\nUSA Gymnastics brought on former U.S. Representative Mary Bono to serve as interim president and CEO last month. Bono didn\u2019t last a week, stepping away after drawing criticism for an Instagram post she made shortly before she was hired that was critical of Nike placing former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick at the forefront of a marketing campaign.\n\nAll these moves simply added fuel to those who were seeking the total dismantling of USAG.\n\nOlympian Jamie Dantzscher, the first gymnast to sue USAG, said she grew tired of USAG\u2019s \u201ccynical PR statements about how much they care about athletes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is time for this organization to be replaced,\u201d she said. \u201cMy only regret is that it has taken the U.S. Olympic Committee so long to act.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Will Graves contributed to this report.", "Chicago Bears' Leonard Floyd (94) tackles Buffalo Bills' LeSean McCoy (25) during the first half of an NFL football game Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, in Orchard Park, N.Y.

And they don\u2019t need to be reminded how important this upcoming stretch is.\n\n\u201cWe know that going into these division games, it\u2019s going to take a whole other level. They know us, we know them. We play them twice,\u201d linebacker Leonard Floyd said. \u201cWe know now that our level of play is going to have to rise even more.\u201d\n\nA 41-9 romp at Buffalo on Sunday after beating the New York Jets at home the previous week gave them back-to-back wins over the teams with the two worst records in the AFC East.\n\nBut now, they\u2019re staring at the meat of their schedule.\n\nChicago (5-3) hosts Detroit and Minnesota the next two weeks, with the game against the second-place Vikings (5-3-1) on Nov. 18 getting moved to prime time. After that comes a short turnaround before a Thanksgiving matchup on the road against the Lions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unique, just like it was playing the four AFC East teams we just played from the same division, but it is what it is,\u201d coach Matt Nagy said on Monday. \u201cWe put ourselves in a good position, but no one\u2019s gonna be looking past Detroit.\u201d\n\nThe Bears matched their win total from last season as well as their best eight-game start since 2013. They\u2019re pushing for their first playoff appearance since the 2010 team lost to Green Bay in the NFC championship game.\n\nBut when it comes to division play, the results in recent years are not good.\n\nChicago has four straight last-place finishes and a 4-21 record against the NFC North since the start of the 2014 season. The Bears also have a 10-game losing streak against the division, their most recent victory coming against Minnesota on Oct. 31, 2016.\n\nTheir only game this year against an NFC North team was the season opener at Green Bay. And that loss was a gut wrencher as the Bears blew a 20-point lead against an injured Aaron Rodgers and lost 24-23.\n\n\u201cI understand, but that\u2019s the thing with us and where we\u2019re going \u2014 we try not to get to the past,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cWe really don\u2019t. We\u2019re in such a good place right now as an organization. The vibe that we have. We\u2019re learning how to win in different ways. We\u2019ve learned what losing\u2019s about and how you respond from that. But we\u2019re trying to really create our own culture and create our own history.\u201d\n\nIn his first season as a head coach, Nagy has the Bears positioning themselves for the postseason. But he insisted he does not use that possibility to motivate the team.\n\n\u201cWe worry about playoffs, then we\u2019re worrying about the wrong thing,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cWe have a lot of season left.\u201d\n\nGetting star pass rusher Khalil Mack (ankle) and No. 1 receiver Allen Robinson (groin) back could help. Both players have missed the past two games, with Nagy saying they remain day to day. If they do play, the question is how healthy and effective they will be.\n\nTheir status could become clearer once the team returns to practice. Both players sat out on Wednesday and Thursday the past two weeks before participating on a limited basis Friday and ultimately being held out of the games.\n\nThe Bears were able to beat two struggling teams without them. But the schedule is taking a tougher turn.\n\n\u201cYou know all we have to do is win,\u201d tight end Trey Burton said. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to what the guys are saying on the outside and focus on what we\u2019re doing on the inside.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.apnews.com/tag/NFL and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "FILE- In this Oct. 20, 2018 file photo, Nebraska running back Devine Ozigbo (22) runs for a touchdown during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Minnesota in Lincoln, Neb.

(AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File)\n\nLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Its goal of a winning season long gone, Nebraska is shifting some attention to Devine Ozigbo and a couple of his teammates\u2019 pursuits of individual milestones.\n\nOzigbo needs 204 yards over the final three games to become the Cornhuskers\u2019 first 1,000-yard rusher since Ameer Abdullah in 2014. Since 1971, the Huskers have never gone four straight years without a player making it to 1,000.\n\n\u201cIt kind of came up as the season went along, that I was getting close,\u201d Ozigbo said Monday. \u201cNow it\u2019s something I definitely want to go out and grab for a personal goal. I definitely want to do it for the team and for the fans. It\u2019s something they\u2019ve been talking about for a few years now, and it would be good to give it to them.\u201d\n\nReceivers JD Spielman and Stanley Morgan each are within striking distance of becoming the school\u2019s first 1,000-yard receiver. Spielman has 59 catches for 747 yards and Morgan has 51 for 725.\n\nThe Huskers (2-7, 1-5 Big Ten) begin the last quarter of their season Saturday at home against Illinois (4-5, 2-4).\n\n\u201cOur first goal, obviously, is to win games, and we\u2019ll do whatever we have to do on offense to win games,\u201d coach Scott Frost said. \u201cBut I\u2019d love to see Devine get to 1,000 and love to see Stanley and JD get to 1,000. I was just made aware of their numbers today, because I don\u2019t really look at that. I think it\u2019s possible for all of them to do it if we play well on defense, and if those guys hit those benchmarks that means we probably put ourselves in position to win games.\u201d\n\nSpielman and Morgan went into the season already known as a couple of the Big Ten\u2019s best receivers. That Ozigbo is in position to add his name to Nebraska\u2019s distinguished list of 1,000-yard rushers would have seemed unlikely two months ago.\n\nOzigbo had never run for 500 yards any of his first three years in the program, and he wasn\u2019t a full-fledged starter until the fourth game this season. He went into September listed as the No. 3 running back behind Greg Bell, who has since transferred, and freshman Maurice Washington.\n\n\u201cComing into this year, I definitely knew that it might not be all I wanted, because we have so many talented guys here,\u201d Ozigbo said. \u201cI knew I was going to be in a limited role, but I was going to try to make the most out of it.\u201d\n\nOzigbo ran for 170 yards and two touchdowns against Purdue on Sept. 29, and after he went for 152 yards and two TDs against Minnesota on Oct. 20 , Frost said Ozigbo showed NFL potential.\n\nThe difference between the Ozigbo of 2017 and 2018 is apparent. The 6-foot, 235-pounder is stronger, moving the pile forward on a number of runs, and he\u2019s able to reach his top speed faster. He said credit goes to arduous strength and conditioning drills in the offseason and an overhauled nutrition program, both of which helped him reduce his body fat from 16 percent to 12 percent.\n\n\u201cYou can tell that he\u2019s driven, he really has fallen in love with the way we do things here and he\u2019s taken it upon himself to get that extra yard,\u201d offensive lineman Jerald Foster said.\n\nOzigbo originally made a verbal commitment to Iowa State, but he was wooed away when Nebraska\u2019s interim staff started showing interest in him during the period between Bo Pelini\u2019s firing and Mike Riley\u2019s hiring in December 2014.\n\nOzigbo is from Sachse, Texas, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and he was well aware of the accomplishments of Rex Burkhead, who\u2019s from nearby Plano. Burkhead ran for 1,357 yards and 15 TDs in 2011 before his injury-plagued senior season.\n\nIf Ozigbo hits 1,000, he will join Burkhead and 21 other Nebraska players who have accomplished the feat.\n\n\u201cI knew in the past they always had a high-caliber group of running backs that came through,\u201d Ozigbo said. \u201cSeeing what he did here, I liked that. He\u2019s from my area. He plays good ball. They treated him well. I can do something like that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "Fournette back at practice, but Jags unsure if he will play\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Jacksonville Jaguars running back Leonard Fournette practiced for the first time in more than a month Monday, working with the first-team offense and looking like he might be fully healthy for the first time since the season opener.\n\nBut coach Doug Marrone stopped short of proclaiming Fournette back or ready to return Sunday at Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he is going to play,\u201d Marrone said.\n\nFournette has missed six games, including all four during the team\u2019s four-game losing streak, because of a strained right hamstring. The Jaguars (3-5) reacted to Fournette\u2019s prolonged absence by signing free agent Jamaal Charles and then trading for Carlos Hyde.\n\nFournette has 20 carries for 71 yards this season and has missed nine games in two years because of injuries and suspension, creating doubts about the fourth overall selection in the 2017 NFL draft.\n\nJacksonville built its offensive scheme around Fournette and needs him back to potentially take pressure off inconsistent quarterback Blake Bortles.\n\nMarrone, though, won\u2019t know about Fournette\u2019s availability until later in the week.\n\n\u201cHow things happen during the week is really what answers a lot of those questions,\u201d he said. \u201cWednesday, Thursday, Friday, you are worried about this guy. Is he going to be able to play? Is he going to play the full amount? Did we get the other guys ready enough? What plays does he feel comfortable with? What plays do other people feel comfortable with?\n\n\u201cYou go back and forth because, at the end of the day, your job is to try and put the team in the best situation to win.

(AP Photo/Eric Christian Smith, File)\n\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 The Buffalo Bills might have some good news on offense, for once.\n\nRookie quarterback Josh Allen resumed throwing for the first time in three weeks since spraining his right elbow, and there\u2019s a possibility he could play against the New York Jets this weekend.\n\nCoach Sean McDermott wouldn\u2019t rule out Allen from playing Sunday, but was cautious in adding, \u201cI\u2019m going to take it day to day at this point.\u201d\n\nAllen began testing his arm on Friday, and continued through the weekend, McDermott said. On Monday, Allen threw about 100 passes during a workout, which translates into an average workload during a normal practice.\n\nMcDermott stressed he\u2019s going to take a cautious approach regarding Allen, and noted one option is providing him additional time to heal with Buffalo (2-7) entering its bye week after playing at New York.\n\nShould he play, the matchup against the Jets (3-6) would pit the Bills rookie against quarterback Sam Darnold, who was drafted third overall, four spots ahead of Allen.\n\nAllen has been out since being hurt during a 20-13 loss at Houston on Oct. 14, which began the Bills\u2019 four-game skid.\n\nBuffalo\u2019s quarterback position has been in flux since and contributed to a sputtering offense which has scored 20 points in its past three games and an NFL-worst 96 overall this season.\n\nDerek Anderson turned the ball over six times in two starts before sustaining a concussion in a 25-6 loss to New England last week. Nathan Peterman threw three interceptions in a 41-9 loss to Chicago on Sunday.\n\nAnderson remains in the NFL\u2019s concussion protocol.\n\nShould Allen not be ready, McDermott said Anderson would be the next in line to start if he\u2019s cleared to play.\n\nIn updating other injuries, McDermott said running back Chris Ivory has been released from the hospital after being evaluated for what he called \u201cinternal issues\u201d separate from a shoulder injury he sustained against Chicago. Ivory is considered day to day.\n\nStarting tight end Charles Clay is listed week to week after hurting his hamstring on Sunday.\n\nAllen\u2019s pending return is an encouraging sign for an offense that\u2019s been anemic no matter who\u2019s behind center. The 22-year-old has a 2-3 record since taking over the job in Week 2, and lost plenty of developmental opportunities while being sidelined.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never easy for a young player to miss reps, valuable reps. But it\u2019s offered a nice perspective in kind of a glass-half-full in terms of his development,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cHe\u2019s had a chance to watch, take a step back and learn while being on the sideline.\u201d\n\nIt couldn\u2019t have been easy watching.\n\nBuffalo has scored just two touchdowns in its past five games, and Peterman\u2019s 1-yard run against Chicago ended a TD drought that spanned 187 minutes and 19 seconds. With just eight touchdowns all season, the Bills are one of just 13 teams since 1940 with that many or fewer through nine games, according to Pro Football Reference.\n\n\u201cTo get the results we\u2019ve gotten on that side of the ball in particular leaves you frustrated, leaves you empty-handed,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cOur fan base deserves better. That\u2019s what we\u2019re committed to do. That\u2019s what I came here to do, and to do it the right way. It takes some time.\u201d\n\nAnd, though McDermott won\u2019t acknowledge it publicly, it\u2019ll take more talent.\n\nBuffalo\u2019s offensive line is a patchwork unit that lost two starters \u2014 center Eric Wood and guard Richie Incognito \u2014 this offseason.\n\nProtection is an issue. Buffalo\u2019s 33 sacks are the second-most allowed in the NFL.\n\nAnd the running attack has ground to a halt with LeSean McCoy having combined for 23 yards on 22 carries over the past two games.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of work to do, a lot of getting better to do. Not where we need to be,\u201d offensive coordinator Brian Daboll said.\n\nThe Bills claimed receiver Isaiah McKenzie on Monday, three days after he was placed on waivers by Denver. He was used mostly as a kickoff and punt returner in 12 career games, including one this season, since being selected in the fifth round of the 2017 draft out of Georgia.\n\nBuffalo created a roster spot by releasing receiver Cam Phillips.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "FILE - In this Nov. 1, 2018 file photo, Indiana's Romeo Langford (0) shoots as Southern Indiana's Nate Hansen (5) defends during a college basketball exhibition game, in Bloomington, Ind.

He\u2019s always making the extra pass. We all know he can score, and he shows that ability, but he also is able to see passes and plays before they even happen. \u201d\n\nLangford is just getting started, though most people on campus and around the state certainly know his resume.\n\nLangford finished his career at New Albany High School, just across the river from Louisville, ranked No. 4 all-time in Indiana with 3,002 points. He won a state a title, turning a small Indiana town into a feature destination for some of college basketball\u2019s most revered coaches. He was a member of the McDonald\u2019s All-American team last year and twice was selected as a Naismith All-American. Gatorade named him the Indiana Player of the Year and one of three finalists for national player of the year as a high school senior.\n\nBut until his announcement last spring, many wondered and worried whether Langford would follow the recent trend of other high-profile prep stars who decided to leave the state.\n\nWhen Langford finally put those fears to rest with one of the longest announcement ceremonies in memory, he immediately became the top prize in a five-player recruiting class that included two additional 2,000-point scorers in guard Rob Phinisee and forward Damezi Anderson, both Indiana All-State selections.\n\nIt also proved second-year coach Archie Miller could win some of those tough in-state recruiting battles.\n\nNow comes the hard part \u2014 meeting or exceeding all those lofty expectations.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t feel pressure,\u201d Langford said on media day. \u201cI\u2019m just coming here to play basketball and do my job, and that\u2019s all I\u2019m focusing on, having a successful season with my teammates.\u201d\n\nMiller wouldn\u2019t want it any other way though he understands the microscope Langford will be under. While all three in-state freshmen have gotten a glimpse into opening night at Indiana through Hoosier Hysteria, a \u201csecret\u201d scrimmage against Loyola and an exhibition game against Southern Indiana, the Chicago State game will be entirely different \u2014 especially for Langford.\n\nEvery move he makes will be heavily scrutinized by fans who pride themselves on nitpicking little things on the court and treat basketball stars like a part of their personal royal family.\n\nMiller, of course, addresses it differently.\n\n\u201cBasically, we want you to do what we\u2019re asking you to do every day. You can\u2019t on game day all of a sudden turn into some Superman,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought our guys were really serious (against Loyola), they were ready to go when we scrimmaged which sometimes in a closed scrimmage you don\u2019t get because there are no people there.\u201d\n\nWhile the 6-foot-6, 215-pound shooting guard certainly can score and should help the Hoosiers spread the floor, producing open shots for others, he\u2019s much more than a scorer.\n\nAs Morgan and Miller both noted, he dissects plays quickly and can turn challenging plays into easy ones. He makes others around him better and possesses an uncanny drive to continue improving as an all-around player.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guy that I think is so used to really being perfect in many ways or at least trying to approach being perfect in many ways, that making mistakes and some things like that here has gotten him out of his comfort zone,\u201d Miller said in September. \u201cIt bothered him, whether he missed a couple shots in a row on a drill or whether he\u2019s been in practice and he struggled defensively early. You could see almost a pressure or almost a, \u2018Wow, this isn\u2019t as easy as I maybe once thought.\u2019\u201d\n\nLangford has embraced Miller\u2019s defense-first philosophy, the offensive system and his new role. He was rewarded with the second gold jersey of the season, which Miller gives to the best practice player of the week.\n\nFor teammates, it rekindles memories of their own unforgettable moments.\n\n\u201cI had just joined the team and coach (Tom) Crean decided to start me my first game,\u201d senior forward Zach McRoberts said, recalling an exhibition game against Hope College. \u201cThat was really special, walking out there for the first time, it was a great atmosphere.\u201d\n\nLangford can only hope his debut will be a sign of what\u2019s to come.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "", "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 A judge has ruled Salt Lake County\u2019s clerk complied with state election law in issuing ballots to registered voters in a timely manner.\n\nA lawsuit filed last week by two Republican candidates claimed thousands of ballots weren\u2019t shipped out to voters in a timely manner.\n\nDemocratic Clerk Sherrie Swensen says there was a delay due to a vendor problem, but mail-in ballots went out in time.\n\nThird District Judge Robert Faust dismissed the suit Monday by Swensen\u2019s opponent, Republican county clerk candidate Rozan Mitchell.\n\nAccording to the Salt Lake Tribune, Mitchell contended that up to 32,000 ballots weren\u2019t mailed by a state-mandated deadline.\n\nSwensen says the clerk\u2019s office mailed one ballot for each person who had registered as an active voter in the county before the Oct. 16 deadline.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Salt Lake Tribune, http://www.sltrib.com", "Huddersfield Town's Steve Mounie, center right, and Fulham's Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa battle for the ball during their English Premier League soccer match at The John Smith's Stadium, Huddersfield, England, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018.

(AP) \u2014 Four Tennessee death row inmates are asking a federal court to allow them to have a firing squad used as an execution method.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed Friday, a day after Edmund Zagorski was executed at a Tennessee maximum security prison using the electric chair. Zagorski\u2019s attorneys argued the method was more humane than selecting lethal injection because it would take a shorter amount of time for the inmate to die. It was the first electrocution the state had conducted since 2007.\n\nThe four inmates named in the lawsuit include David Earl Miller, who is scheduled to be executed on Dec. 6 and is the longest-standing death row inmate in Tennessee.\n\nMiller was sentenced to death in 1981 for the rape and murder of 23-year-old Lee Standifer, who was mentally handicapped, in Knoxville.\n\nMiller will be asked Tuesday to choose his execution method. The lawsuit seeks to delay that decision until a federal judge can review their case, as well as delay his execution.\n\n\u201cThere exists one or more feasible and readily-available alternative methods of execution which substantially reduce the constitutionally-unacceptable risk of inflicting unnecessary and serious pain created by the use of electrocution to carry out Plaintiffs\u2019 executions,\u201d wrote Stephen Kissinger, a federal public defender representing the inmates.\n\nThe suit adds that the state already has the trained personnel, firearms and space to allow for a firing squad. However, if the court disagrees, the suit also asks for permission to use other alternatives such as orally administering lethal drugs over using a needle, or using different forms of drugs.\n\n\u201cBecause lethal injection is the default method of execution, plaintiffs must elect electrocution in order to avoid a harsher punishment than the punishment provided by law at the time of the crimes,\u201d Kissinger wrote.\n\nThe lawsuit goes on to argue that if an inmate chooses electrocution, inmates \u201cmay forfeit the right to challenge the constitutionality of electrocution under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Correction said it would be \u201cimproper\u201d to provide a comment with the lawsuit still pending.\n\nOther inmates listed in the lawsuit include Nicholas Todd Sutton, Stephen Michael West and Terry Lynn King.\n\nMiller, Sutton and West had filed a similar lawsuit earlier this year pushing for alternatives to Tennessee\u2019s lethal injection method but eventually voluntarily dismissed their case due to other challenges to the state\u2019s execution procedures.\n\nThe last time a firing squad was used in the U.S. was in 2010, when Ronnie Lee Gardner was killed by a firing squad in Utah for the 1984 murder of attorney Michael Burdell during a failed courthouse escape.\n\nToday, just three states \u2014 Mississippi, Oklahoma and Utah \u2014 continue to allow the use of firing squads.", "Miami Dolphins defensive end Cameron Wake (91) sacks New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold (14), during the first half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, in Miami Gardens, Fla.

New York Jets fans certainly know the feeling.\n\nAfter throwing four interceptions in an ugly 13-6 loss at Miami on Sunday , the rookie quarterback shouldered the blame and was looking for answers.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s just not playing to the best of my ability and, quite frankly, just playing stupid,\u201d Darnold said Monday. \u201cI thought I played stupid football yesterday and I\u2019ve just got to be better. I know that, the coaches know that and everyone knows that.\u201d\n\nWell, yeah.\n\nBut Darnold isn\u2019t alone. Not by any stretch.\n\nMost of the venom from frustrated fans on social media and sports talk radio was directed at coach Todd Bowles, whose hold on his job has become increasingly tenuous as the Jets (3-6) head toward another year \u2014 it would be eight straight \u2014 without making the playoffs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of losing,\u201d second-year safety Jamal Adams said after the game. \u201cI\u2019m not a loser. I want to get back on the winning track. We\u2019ve lost three straight? Come on, man.\u201d\n\nThis is now a franchise staring at a crossroads.\n\nThe Jets have a home game Sunday against the bumbling Buffalo Bills (2-7), who somehow look even more inept than their AFC East counterparts.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s huge,\u201d Bowles acknowledged. \u201cIt\u2019s our next game. It\u2019s a division rivalry. ... Winning takes care of a lot problems and a lot of issues. It\u2019s important for us to win the next ballgame.\u201d\n\nA loss at MetLife Stadium will raise the heat under Bowles\u2019 seat to scorching levels. And, it could force owner Christopher Johnson to seriously re-evaluate things \u2014 especially with the team heading into a bye-week break.\n\n\u201cPeople are obviously a little upset, a little disappointed, coming off three straight losses,\u201d defensive lineman Leonard Williams said. \u201cWe definitely needed this one. It was a division game and we talked all week about how important it was for us to get this win.\u201d\n\nAnd, they still lost.\n\nBut there are enough culprits to share the blame.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just Sam, it\u2019s the team, period,\u201d Bowles said. \u201cYesterday, it was mainly the offense. It was tweaks here and there, but we just have to play better and execute as a whole.\u201d\n\nDarnold, of course, had his worst game to date. Center Spencer Long had several wayward shotgun snaps because of a reinjured right middle finger before Bowles finally pulled him from the game. Jeremy Bates\u2019 offense seemed stuck in neutral, and wide receivers rarely gave Darnold a target. And, even the normally sure-handed Jermaine Kearse had a few drops and capped a bad day by forgetting where he was on the field before catching a pass late in the game while standing out of bounds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very concerned because we didn\u2019t score a bunch of points the last three weeks,\u201d Bowles said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to execute better and get it right.\u201d\n\nDarnold\u2019s OK with pointing the finger at himself. But it has raised the thought he might be best served sitting for a week just to clear his head while 39-year-old backup Josh McCown takes the field.\n\nA quarterback change, however, doesn\u2019t appear to be in the plans.\n\n\u201cNot at this time,\u201d Bowles said, \u201cno.\u201d\n\nDarnold, the No. 3 overall draft pick, leads the NFL with 14 interceptions and has struggled during the last three games. He said \u201cI thought I played bad\u201d on Sunday and added he thought the offensive line \u201cblocked their butts off.\u201d\n\nStill, the Jets scored six points and have 33 in their last three games combined.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just got to play smarter, play better,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, I definitely feel like I forced some things (Sunday), but at the same time, I feel like there were some throws where I was second-guessing myself and I could\u2019ve pulled the trigger.\u201d\n\nThe last thing the Jets want is for their still-developing franchise QB is to become increasingly gun-shy.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just me at some moments in the game getting in my own head,\u201d Darnold said. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to stay true to my progressions, stay true to the confidence that I normally have, and just go out there and sling it.\u201d\n\nThe defense was mostly solid, allowing just 168 total yards, the second fewest under Bowles. That included 104 yards passing, the lowest under Bowles.\n\nYet, the Jets still came up short in a game they all acknowledged they should have won.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest consensus overall, for the players and for the coaches and as an organization, we all know that sticking together is what\u2019s going to help us continue the season,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIf we start dividing now, if coaches start dividing from players and players from players and coaches from coaches \u2014 any type of division in this organization \u2014 is only going to hinder us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "1 of 4 Purdue fans celebrate a touchdown against Iowa in the second half of an NCAA college football game in West Lafayette, Ind., Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018. (AP Photo/AJ Mast)\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) \u2014 Jeff Brohm turned around Purdue\u2019s season with a style change.\n\nAfter starting 0-3, Purdue finds itself one win from becoming bowl eligible, one game behind Northwestern in the Big Ten West Division and perhaps one week away from knowing whether a division crown remains a possibility.\n\n\u201cGoing back to those other three games, I think they had it in them,\u201d Brohm said following Saturday\u2019s upset of No. 19 Iowa. \u201cBut they had a head coach that wasn\u2019t as aggressive as he is now.\u201d\n\nBrohm has long believed the path to victory in college football comes by staying on the attack. But after losing twice in part because of late personal foul calls against his defense and a third time after a replay review overturned a go-ahead touchdown, Brohm decided his team wasn\u2019t going down without a fight.\n\nThe Boilermakers (5-4, 4-2) won five of their next six by routinely throwing deep and using a full gamut of trick plays \u2014 everything from the quarterback touchdown reception to the daring first-down run from punter Joe Schopper on a fake field goal in the upset of Ohio State.\n\nBrohm acknowledges his stint as a quarterback in the XFL taught him serious players could still have fun playing the game, a lesson he puts to use seemingly every week.\n\n\u201cIf you want to be a contender in the conference, you\u2019ve got to win, and if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re out,\u201d Brohm said Monday. \u201cThat kind of happened to us at the end of last year and we kind of had something similar where we knew our backs were against the wall and we had to win to advance. In our mind, we have to win to advance and stay a contender.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a big reason Brohm appears to be headed toward a fifth straight bowl game as a head coach and perhaps a conference championship game appearance. A win at Minnesota on Saturday and a home win over Wisconsin would put Purdue in the mix \u2014 if Iowa beats Northwestern at home this weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indiana Hoosiers are staring at an all-too-familiar fate.\n\nComing off of their bye week, the winding road to the postseason is full of challenges after starting 4-1.They\u2019ve lost four straight and need to win two of their last three just to become eligible for their third bowl bid in four years.\n\nBut even if they beat Maryland at home Saturday, they still need to beat either No. 4 Michigan or the rival Boilermakers at home. Indiana hasn\u2019t won in Ann Arbor since 1967 though it will get the Wolverines the week before they face Ohio State. The Hoosiers have beaten Purdue in four of the last five meetings.\n\nLike the Boilermakers, the Hoosiers have remained competitive against some of the Big Ten\u2019s top teams.\n\nUnlike Purdue, though, Indiana has struggled to close out games. The difference has put their postseason hopes in peril.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s continuing to keep our guys locked in, keeping where they need to be mentally, which I feel we have some strong leadership that has helped with that,\u201d coach Tom Allen said Monday. \u201cThe bottom line is it\u2019s about us finishing in key situations.\u201d\n\nOne possible solution: Stealing a fashion tip from Brohm.\n\n\u201cWe started 0-3 and lost to some teams maybe we shouldn\u2019t have lost to,\u201d Brohm said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t aggressive in our approach. We didn\u2019t go for the win. We played not to lose at times.

Open seats for governor and U.S. senator in Tennessee have Democrats believing they have their best chance to gain ground in the upcoming general election.

(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey, Pool, File)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Tennessee election officials expect high turnout to continue Tuesday as voters elect a new governor and U.S. senator.\n\nThe two open statewide contests brought a surge in enthusiasm during the two-week early voting period, with 1.38 million early and absentee ballots cast.\n\nWhile high for a midterm election, this year\u2019s early totals are about 18 percent lower than the 1.68 million ballots cast in advance in President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election.\n\nThe 2018 numbers are about 5 percent lower than in former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election year, when 1.46 million people voted early or absentee.\n\nVoters will also make their picks for the U.S. House and the Republican-led General Assembly. Polls open at different hours across the state Tuesday, but all will close at 7 p.m. Central time.\n\nHere is a look at major contests:\n\nU.S. SENATE\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn and Democratic former Gov. Phil Bredesen are locked in a tough, expensive fight to replace Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who is retiring.\n\nThe campaign spending has shattered Tennessee records, as Bredesen argues he would be an independent voice in Washington, and Blackburn counters by tying him to national Democrats. Blackburn has closely aligned herself with the White House, having drawn visits to Tennessee from President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and other prominent Republicans.\n\nBredesen\u2019s campaign has spent $15.2 million through mid-October, while outside groups have spent about $26.3 million so far to help him. Republican U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, has shelled out about $12 million through mid-October, and outside groups some $31.6 million for her bid so far.\n\nBlackburn, from Brentwood, was first elected to the U.S. House in 2002. She calls herself a \u201chardcore, card-carrying Tennessee conservative\u201d who will fight for Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nBredesen was Tennessee\u2019s governor from 2003 to 2011, and served as Nashville\u2019s mayor before that. He says he will work with Trump when his ideas make sense for Tennessee and oppose the president when they don\u2019t.\n\nGOVERNOR\n\nDemocrat Karl Dean, Nashville\u2019s former mayor, faces Republican businessman Bill Lee in the contest to replace term-limited Republican Bill Haslam.\n\nThe battle for governor has played second fiddle to the Senate race, as Lee has maintained a comfortable lead with Dean refusing to stray too far from positive messaging.\n\nDean has increasingly criticized Lee\u2019s vague policy answers. In a rare, hard-hitting television ad, Dean warned Lee would be \u201can extreme governor\u201d due to his support for private school vouchers and arming teachers.\n\nBut the Democrat\u2019s most prominent issue has been Medicaid expansion. Dean supports the proposal, while pointing out that Republicans have not offered a detailed plan to help Tennesseans who lack health care coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, Lee vows to lobby the Republican-dominant legislature to vote against such proposals and instead says Tennessee\u2019s soaring health care costs and access challenges may take up to 20 years to fix.\n\nLee, a political newcomer, touts his faith and used the success of his business \u2014 Lee Company, a $225 million mechanical contracting, facilities and home services firm with more than 1,200 employees \u2014 to argue that he\u2019s ready to lead the state.\n\nU.S. HOUSE\n\nSix of Tennessee\u2019s nine U.S. House races include incumbents who are expected to hold on to their seats, barring a major upset. Republicans currently hold seven of the state\u2019s congressional seats. Three GOP-held seats are open.\n\nDistrict 2 in East Tennessee will be vacated due to the retirement of Republican John Duncan Jr. Former GOP Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett faces Democrat Renee Hoyos, executive director of the Tennessee Clean Water Network, in the race to replace Duncan.\n\nRepublican Diane Black\u2019s failed gubernatorial run makes room for a new face in District 6 in the northern part of the state. Republican farmer John Rose and Democratic physician Marty Olsen will face off for Black\u2019s seat.\n\nRepublican Marsha Blackburn\u2019s run for U.S. Senate leaves District 7 open as well. That race pits GOP state Sen. Mark Green against Democrat Justin Kanew, a film producer and former \u201cAmazing Race\u201d contestant.\n\nLEGISLATURE\n\nAll 99 seats in the state House and 18 of the 33 state Senate seats are being contested. Republicans are expected to maintain supermajorities in the General Assembly.\n\nPlenty of lawmakers won\u2019t be returning. Eighteen Republican and seven Democratic incumbents in the House are not seeking re-election, and two Republicans lost in the primary.\n\nThey include Republican Speaker Beth Harwell of Nashville and Democratic Minority Leader Craig Fitzhugh of Ripley, who both unsuccessfully ran for governor.\n\nIn the Senate, Democratic Sens. Lee Harris and Thelma Harper, and Republican Sen. Bill Ketron of Murfreesboro did not seek re-election. Democratic Sen. Reginald Tate lost a primary contest.\n\nThirteen seats in the Senate and 73 in the House feature a contested race with a Democrat and Republican.", "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 NASCAR did not have its finest day at Texas Motor Speedway, where things first went awry with an erroneous penalty even before the race.\n\nKevin Harvick won and advanced to the championship round for the fourth time in five years. His victory wasn\u2019t all that surprising because the 2014 champion had said for months he was most looking forward to Texas because he believed it would be his winning ticket into the final four.\n\nThe drama instead came from NASCAR officiating, one playoff driver complaining that another raced him too hard and another snoozer of a race.\n\nJimmie Johnson was incorrectly sent to the back of the field moments before the race began. Officials in NASCAR\u2019s scoring tower punished Johnson\u2019s team for failing pre-race inspection three times. The problem? His car had only failed inspection two times, so the penalty was incorrect.\n\nNASCAR admitted the error during Sunday\u2019s race but it was too late to remedy. Steve O\u2019Donnell, NASCAR\u2019s chief racing development officer, didn\u2019t hide from the error after the event and promised steps would be taken to prevent such a blunder moving forward. O\u2019Donnell called the mistake \u201cunacceptable\u201d and promised system upgrades before this weekend\u2019s penultimate race of the season at Phoenix.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those things, again, a human error that we\u2019ve really got to look at and look at some additional procedures we can have in place prior to Phoenix,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said Monday on SiriusXM NASCAR Radio. \u201cWe\u2019ll have those done (Monday), and we\u2019ll be communicating those first and foremast to the team that was affected and then to the industry as well.\u201d\n\nJohnson, the seven-time NASCAR champion, has already been eliminated from this year\u2019s playoffs. But he\u2019s winless this season, just signed a new sponsor and went to Texas with just three races remaining with Chad Knaus, the crew chief who built his team in 2001. An erroneous penalty issued after he was already in his car set the tone for a rotten day that can\u2019t be corrected.\n\nO\u2019Donnell was also asked to explain a penalty on Clint Bowyer, who is still in the playoffs and whose team was flagged for a crew member being over the wall during a pit stop. Except the crew member in question was actually sitting on the pit road wall, though the penalty was correct because his feet were resting on the ground. Yes, a rule was broken. But it was a call that left some wondering if NASCAR has gotten too heavy-handed in enforcing a cumbersome and confusing rulebook.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the rule. I know people don\u2019t necessarily like all the rules, but that\u2019s the rule,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t make that call, I think (media) would be asking why we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHad the racing been more interesting the Johnson gaffe might have become just a footnote. But the ticky-tack call on Bowyer\u2019s team on top of it only gave fans more reason to complain. NASCAR\u2019s on-track product has greatly deteriorated through evolving rules packages, and even O\u2019Donnell had to admit that the entertainment was far superior in Friday night\u2019s Truck Series race, and again in the Xfinity Series race on Saturday, to what fans got to see Sunday in the main event.\n\nNASCAR is hoping its 2019 rules package is a move toward more action.\n\nTexas Motor Speedway President Eddie Gossage also said the repaved Texas asphalt needs more weathering to improve the racing, which had only one real nugget of interest on the track all day: Aric Almirola took exception to Joey Logano racing him hard in the final stage. Logano already has a slot in the final four and Almirola believed Logano could have backed off a bit.\n\n\u201cIf that is the way he wants to race me when he is already locked into Homestead and we are out here fighting for our lives, that is fine,\u201d Almirola said. \u201cWhen Homestead comes around if I am not in, he will know it.\u201d\n\nAlmirola\u2019s anger was at least interesting \u2014 even if his is a misguided belief that Logano should go easy on drivers still chasing the remaining two spots in the season finale.\n\nTexas was not a good race for NASCAR from start to finish. There are only two races remaining before a much-needed break and NASCAR hits a reset for 2019. The bad news is those races have a championship at stake and are two more opportunities for NASCAR to have rotten days.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "CHARLESTON, S.C.

(AP Photo/Chuck Burton)\n\nDino Babers sure didn\u2019t want his third year at Syracuse to turn out like the first two, so he\u2019s adjusted his routines. So far, the move has paid off.\n\nThe surprising Orange (7-2, 4-2 Atlantic Coast Conference, No. 19 CFP), fresh from a road victory over Wake Forest on Saturday , moved up nine spots to No. 13 this week in the AP Top 25 . It\u2019s the school\u2019s highest ranking since Donovan McNabb led the Orange to a 10-point victory over Michigan in the Big House in September 1998.\n\nPerhaps more importantly for Babers, the Orange are 1-0 in November, the month that has been their Achilles\u2019 heel, mainly because of injuries. Instead of reeling \u2014 Syracuse was 1-11 in November the previous three years \u2014 the Orange are on a roll with three straight ACC wins, including two in a row without a turnover, and know they\u2019ll finish the regular season with a winning record. They went 4-8 twice under Babers and once under former coach Scott Shafer.\n\nThe win over Wake Forest snapped the Orange\u2019s eight-game conference losing streak.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge thing. Winning on the road is a huge accomplishment for us,\u201d quarterback Eric Dungey said. \u201cHopefully, it\u2019s the first of four (November wins). Everyone\u2019s together. I think it\u2019s just everybody really bought in. The past couple of years we\u2019ve been through a lot.\u201d\n\nBabers attributes much of the team\u2019s good fortune to a change in the way he\u2019s approached the season, and it started in spring ball.\n\n\u201cI took a lot of planning into trying my best to make sure this team came to November healthy. We changed up a lot of stuff,\u201d Babers said Monday. \u201cWe did not do things exactly the same. That\u2019s the definition of insanity.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if those things were going to help us. I just know that we did it a certain way the two years before and it didn\u2019t work. So, it didn\u2019t make sense to keep doing the exact same thing. That\u2019s not my nature.\u201d\n\nBabers said one of the goals has been \u201cto rotate and do things from a physical and game standpoint that gives different units an opportunity to rest their bodies.\u201d\n\nAlthough the strategy has worked, Babers remains wary.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a situation where it seems like we\u2019re healthier,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still one or two or three injuries away from where we were.\u201d\n\nThe biggest factor in the team\u2019s November struggles was the health of Dungey, or lack of it. The dual-threat star, a fiery presence on the field and off, sat out the final three games of each of the past three seasons with injuries.\n\nThis year Dungey is healthy and, unlike yesteryear , has often displayed he\u2019s more than willing to opt for a slide to safety instead of a head-on collision with a defender when he\u2019s running the ball. He is one of 15 seniors on the team.\n\n\u201cThe senior class, especially, is really taking care of their bodies,\u201d Babers said. \u201cThey are not as tired as they were in 2017, 2016. They\u2019re really, really locked in. These guys are different. You can just tell they\u2019re different. They understand what the word moderation means. It gives them an opportunity to do something special.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see. Doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to happen. It just means they have a chance.\u201d\n\nSyracuse had five rushing TDs and 264 yards on the ground in the 41-24 victory over the injury-riddled Demon Deacons, tops for the team this season in conference play. Dungey took advantage of Wake Forest\u2019s attempt to limit the passing game and rushed for a team-high 119 yards on 24 carries, scoring on a 26-yard run. He now has six 100-yard rushing games and 30 TDs on the ground in his career, and his 1,867 career rushing yards place him 12th all-time among ACC quarterbacks.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone two games (with zero turnovers),\u201d Babers said. \u201cThat\u2019s what big-time quarterbacks do.\u201d\n\nThe Orange\u2019s final three November games are against struggling Louisville (2-7, 0-6) in the home finale on Friday night, No. 3 Notre Dame (9-0) at Yankee Stadium and at No. 17 Boston College (7-2, 4-1).\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "NASHVILLE, Tenn.

That\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d\n\nHarbaugh is in his 11th season with the Ravens. Since taking over for Brian Billick in 2008, he\u2019s compiled a 108-76 record, reached the playoffs six times and won a Super Bowl.\n\nBut the Ravens are in the midst of a serious dry spell, and owner Steve Bisciotti acknowledged last February that firing Harbaugh after the 2017 season \u201cwas certainly a consideration.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s team jumped to a 4-2 start but has since stumbled. Entering a long-awaited bye week, Harbaugh spoke about how badly the Ravens needed the break to rest and heal.\n\n\u201cIf you watch the tape, we played fast, we played hard,\u201d Harbaugh insisted. \u201cBut are we as fast as we were early in the year? Probably not, probably a step off just because it\u2019s Week 9. So this week is going to help us. It\u2019s going to help us pick up that step back, and I\u2019m really kind of excited about that.\u201d\n\nFrom here on out, Harbaugh might have to coach as if his job depended on it. He does not, however, apologize for how he\u2019d guided the Ravens to this point.\n\n\u2019I feel real good about the way this team has been coached for the last 11 years, and for the last number of weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, there are no regrets.

The party\u2019s task was much more difficult in the Senate, where Republicans hold a narrow 51-49 majority but Democrats are defending 10 seats in states won by the president two years ago.\n\nThe two parties were also tangling in several crucial governors\u2019 races, including in Midwest battleground states such as Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa and Michigan.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) \u2014 To be a productive member of the New England Patriots, it\u2019s usually best to approach the game plan each week with adaptive eyes.\n\nNo one has learned that lesson more this season than receiver Cordarrelle Patterson.\n\nWhen he was traded by Oakland to the Patriots in March, Patterson arrived in New England hoping to land a place on Tom Brady\u2019s receiving corps following an offseason shake-up that saw the departures of both Brandin Cooks and Danny Amendola.\n\nBut after a Week 3 neck injury sent veteran running back Rex Burkhead to injured reserve and rookie Sony Michel\u2019s knee injury in Week 7 stunted his strong start, it created a void at another position that itself was recovering from the free agency loss of Dion Lewis.\n\nThe natural solution seemed to be an increased role for veteran James White. Instead the coaching staff chose creativity over predictability.\n\nTwo productive games at running back later, Patterson has become the latest Patriots player to excel in an unconventional role in New England.\n\nPatterson led the Patriots with 61 rushing yards, including a 5-yard touchdown in their 31-17 victory over the Green Bay Packers Sunday night . It was the second straight week he led the team in rushing and came two weeks after he had a 95-yard kickoff return for a touchdown against the Bears.\n\nThat\u2019s just about right for a player called \u201cFlash\u201d early in his career.\n\n\u201cI said I wanted 25 carries this week,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cWhenever my number\u2019s called I\u2019m being ready for whatever I need to do on the football field.\u201d\n\nUsing Patterson out of the backfield isn\u2019t as much of a stretch as it might seem.\n\nCoach Bill Belichick said he noted the 6-foot-2, 220-pounder\u2019s ability to make plays from there when studying his 2017 film with the Raider. He rushed 13 times for 121 yards and two scores with Oakland last season, an average of 9.3 yards per carry.\n\nPatterson was used by the Patriots on some reverses early in the season, again impressing his new coaches with his speed and power attacking holes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s worked really hard with the ball handling, the reads, but boy, he runs hard. He runs fast and he\u2019s a hard guy to tackle,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cLike a lot of our guys have, they just step in, fill the role that we need for them and help the team win, and that\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s become the theme for role players under Belichick.\n\nFullback James Develin was an undrafted defensive end out of Brown before finding a home as the Patriots\u2019 fullback. Matt Slater arrived in New England as a receiver but became its special teams captain and a seven-time Pro Bowler.\n\nWhite said Patterson\u2019s natural skillset and willingness to accept coaching have been his biggest attributes in acclimating to the Patriots\u2019 culture.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a strong, fast, explosive guy,\u201d White said. \u201cHe can score any time he touches the football and he\u2019s been trying to get better and better at it each week. The more he does it, the better he gets.\u201d\n\nMichel was questionable heading into Sunday\u2019s game with Green Bay and could return to action when the Patriots travel to Tennessee this week.\n\nFor now, Patterson said he\u2019s trying to stay humble and hungry in the role he\u2019s been given \u2014 however long it lasts.\n\n\u201cI mean it\u2019s the next man up. It\u2019s the NFL. If you can play, you can play,\u201d He said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t like that the guys weren\u2019t ready, but every guy is going to step up because this is our job.

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Aaron McKie had player development duties in his first season as an assistant coach with the Philadelphia 76ers, which gave him a second-row spot on the bench based on the organizational seating chart. Just months removed from the end of a 13-year NBA career, McKie found it tough to disconnect from his former role as a team leader with his new one in his listen-and-learn role as a rookie coach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be back there yelling all kinds of stuff,\u201d McKie said, laughing. \u201cI had no coaching etiquette whatever. I just didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSixers coach Maurice Cheeks eventually pulled McKie aside and told him he needed to take it down a notch: \u201cThis is why we have these other guys sitting up on the front of the bench.\u201d\n\nBut Cheeks, a basketball Hall of Famer, recognized the potential in McKie and knew one day the guard who helped lead the Sixers to the 2001 NBA Finals would eventually take a more prominent spot on the bench.\n\n\u201cOne day you\u2019re going to be a coach and you\u2019re going to have an opportunity,\u201d McKie recalled Cheeks telling him.\n\nMcKie is finally ready to check in as head coach.\n\nMcKie is a coach-in-waiting at Temple, the program he took to the 1993 Elite Eight and where he sits sixth on the career scoring list as the Owls start their final season under Fran Dunphy. Temple appoints coaches much in the way the senate confirms a Supreme Court justice \u2014 they\u2019re practically jobs for life. Temple has had just four coaches since 1952 and Dunphy, who also coached Penn for 17 seasons, has held the job since 2006.\n\nBut in 2019, it\u2019s McKie\u2019s turn to resuscitate a program that has just one NCAA Tournament berth since 2013 and was picked to finish sixth this season in the American Athletic Conference. The Owls open their season Tuesday against city rival La Salle and McKie will be by Dunphy\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still the head coach,\u201d McKie said. \u201cI have all these ideas and things in my mind that I want to do. But this is his team.\u201d\n\nThe 70-year-old Dunphy, who has a 557-315 career record, has said the decision to leave at the end of the season was his own and he wasn\u2019t encouraged to step down by the administration. He first met with Temple athletic director Patrick Kraft shortly after the Owls were eliminated from the NIT and a transition plan was put in place.\n\nDunphy offered few specifics on why he decided to leave other than, \u201cit just seemed like the right thing to do.\u201d He also did not handpick McKie as his successor, though he endorsed the move. McKie has not yet added additional responsibility to his duties.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve given Aaron and everybody else tremendous ownership over the years,\u201d Dunphy said. \u201cIt\u2019s just sort of business as usual. We talk a lot about the process. He\u2019ll do great. His learning curve is not steep.\u201d\n\nDunphy\u2019s departure comes with a caveat that he\u2019s not retired. He\u2019ll continue to teach his management, theory and practice courses at the Temple business school and refused to rule out an eventual return to the bench.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an unknown out there that is sort of exciting,\u201d Dunphy said. \u201cI haven\u2019t given it a whole lot of thought. These guys deserve my utmost attention to every game, every bounce, every pass.\u201d\n\nKnown as one of the classiest coaches in basketball, Dunphy was recently feted with the Dean Smith Award.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not the norm. He\u2019s a throwback because he cares about people,\u201d McKie said. \u201cDoes he want to continue to coach? Absolutely. He\u2019s a competitive guy and he wants to continue to coach. I\u2019m sure it didn\u2019t play out the way he wanted it to play out. But I believe he\u2019s been very supportive toward me.\u201d\n\nMcKie is a bit of a throwback himself for a program he helped take to some of its greatest heights under Hall of Fame coach John Chaney. Raised by his grandmother in one of the roughest parts of North Philadelphia, and starred at Simon Gratz High School before he signed at Temple. He failed to meet the SAT minimum and sat out a year as a Prop 48 student but went on to earn a degree in social work. A starter for all 92 career games, he averaged 17.9 points and led to Owls to 60 wins, three NCAA Tournaments and was a first-round pick by Portland in 1994.\n\nWhen he returned to Temple in 2014, there were days he thought he wasn\u2019t cut out for the recruiting grind rather than the luxe life in the NBA. But the pull to make a difference for disadvantaged kids made the job worth sticking out.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a lot like me,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of these kids, they come in with scars.\u201d\n\nCharles Barkley stopped by a recent practice and former teammate Allen Iverson hits up McKie with potential recruits in Virginia. After a recent scrimmage against Georgetown, where Iverson starred, McKie told Hoyas coach Patrick Ewing how Iverson had some players he thought could help Temple.\n\n\u201cMan, I\u2019ve been trying to get him up here for two years now and I ain\u2019t seen him yet,\u201d McKie recalled Ewing\u2019s response with a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s AI.\u201d\n\nMcKie will soon join a list of former players such as Ewing, Chris Mullin at St. John\u2019s and Penny Hardaway at Memphis who returned to their former programs in hopes of returning them to similar glory as when they were all-conference stars. Temple lost its shine in part because the program sacrificed the local rivalries in the Atlantic 10 for the geographically challenged AAC for the sake of the football team. For all his success, Dunphy never led the Owls past the second weekend of the tournament and not even Chaney, who made the Hall of Fame, went to a Final Four.\n\nMcKie sat out his freshman season at Temple. He can wait out one more to get his shot as head coach.\n\n\u201cIf you do things right, the wins and the success will come,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "BENNINGTON, Vt. (AP) \u2014 As Sheriff Chad Schmidt was scrolling through Facebook this fall, he couldn\u2019t help but notice a post from a member of the local Meals on Wheels program seeking more volunteer delivery drivers.\n\nSchmidt didn\u2019t need to think twice before contacting Meals on Wheels Assistant Director Vicki Gardner, asking what his department could do to help. It didn\u2019t take long before Schmidt met with Bennington Meals on Wheels Executive Director Ilsa Svoboda and established a plan: from this October forward, members of the Bennington Sheriff\u2019s Department will volunteer their time to deliver meals to Bennington residents in need once a week.\n\nSergeant Lloyd Dean was the first to complete a route on Friday, Oct. 19. Alongside Meals on Wheels volunteer Brian Seitz, he visited ten elderly residents to deliver ten meals throughout downtown Bennington, which is the current route the Sheriff\u2019s Department has been assigned. Each Friday, one of approximately five Sheriff\u2019s Department members will devote their time to delivering these meals.\n\n\u201cThis all started when an organization reached out for help,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cIf organizations in town are struggling and need help, they need to reach out the community. I just happened to be scrolling through my (Facebook) news feed and saw this and started a dialogue (with Gardner) and here we are.\u201d\n\nSchmidt said the opportunity was perfect for both the Sheriff\u2019s Department and Meals on Wheels since Meals on Wheels needed the help and the Sheriff\u2019s Department makes a point to focus on community policing. Not only does it help the Sheriff\u2019s Department interact positively with the community, it helps elderly residents in more ways than one.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the community really knows this, but it\u2019s not just about delivering meals,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cThese are people who are probably traditionally shut in or don\u2019t have the mobility; they don\u2019t see a lot of people or may not have a lot of friends or family. So I think a lot of them see this as a way to interact with someone.\u201d\n\nIn addition to elderly residents looking forward to a hot meal and a friendly face, Meals on Wheels can also serve as a welfare check, a way to get a balanced and nutritious meal, and a time for much-needed socialization.\n\n\u201cA lot of the clients...were very glad to see me,\u201d Dean said.\n\nDuring his first day of delivery, Dean says he took \u201ca bunch of notes\u201d about the route and about each meal recipient, not just for himself but for other department members who volunteer.\n\n\u201cMeals on Wheels has the system down pat,\u201d he remarked, explaining that the organization keeps tabs of each recipient\u2019s name, address, phone number, dietary restrictions, and any other useful information that volunteers need to know before entering the home.\n\n\u201cI took notes on every house we went to,\u201d he said.\n\nSome recipients request that the volunteer pick up the newspaper or mail before they deliver the meal, Dean said.\n\nThe Friday route will vary each week from ten to 14 houses, and deputies will have a chance to sit down and chat with each recipient.\n\nIdeally, approximately five deputies will participate as volunteers: enough so there is a volunteer available each week but not too many so the seniors are not overwhelmed with too many names and faces to remember.\n\nSchmidt says he sent an email about the program to his deputies and received \u201cfour immediate responses\u201d from deputies who wanted to participate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we have to twist their arm,\u201d Schmidt added. \u201cThey are people who are engaged and want to do good things for the community. This gives them that opportunity.\u201d\n\nHe hopes the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s involvement in the program will continue as long as possible.\n\n\u201cIf anything, they\u2019re probably going to convince us to do some more routes because Bennington isn\u2019t the only area they serve,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Department has participated in voluntary community service before, like delivering Thanksgiving meals to the needy as part of the Eagles Club and driving people home for the SafeRide program to combat impaired driving, but this is the first time it will participate in a program so frequently.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be every week instead of once a year,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\n\u201cIt goes along with our commitment to giving back to the community,\u201d Dean added. \u201cThis is just a way to further promote the Sheriff\u2019s Department. That way, citizens get to see law enforcement without their game face on- as normal human beings, as a friendly person knocking on the door- not answering the noise complaint at their home or any other law enforcement action.\u201d\n\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Department hopes this new endeavor will help build trust within the community for all law enforcement.\n\n\u201cPeople see us usually in not-so-great circumstances and that\u2019s only five percent of the time,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cBut the other ninety-five percent of the time we probably aren\u2019t the best at showcasing to the community that, hey, we are normal people. We\u2019re approachable, we\u2019re friendly, we care about the same things you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all do these things on a daily basis,\u201d Dean said. \u201cWe do it because one: we want to do it and two: it\u2019s our job. But we\u2019re now doing a better job of letting people know that we do these things for the community. We don\u2019t earn any extra money for it; it\u2019s just what we do.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2AOt87c\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Bennington Banner, http://www.benningtonbanner.com", "FILE - In this Oct. 13, 2018, file photo Florida quarterback Feleipe Franks passes against Vanderbilt in the first half of an NCAA college football game in Nashville, Tenn.

Trask finished 10-of-18 passing for 126 yards, with a 7-yard scoring pass.\n\nMullen pinned part of his QB problems on the team\u2019s lackluster offensive line and its former staff.\n\nThe coach pointed to two plays early in the second quarter when Franks misfired because of heavy pressure from a non-blitzing defense.\n\n\u201cWe overthrow both of them because the quarterback is getting lit up the second he tries to throw the ball,\u201d said Mullen, who has never made a QB change this late in a season without an injury forcing his hand. \u201cAnd you know what? It was two different guys on two different plays in protection.\n\n\u201cYou can yell at the quarterback ... \u2018keep the feet in the ground, take the big wallop, set your feet and still make the unbelievable throw.\u2019 He needs to do that, too. But you can look and say, \u2018This is why that happened.\u2019\u201d\n\nMullen also suggested that former coach Jim McElwain, who started Franks over journeyman Luke Del Rio and graduate transfer Malik Zaire in 2017, may have thrown the redshirt freshman into the huddle before he was really ready. Mullen said it\u2019s a risk that could end up damaging a young quarterback\u2019s confidence.\n\n\u201cI think you better be really cautious if you\u2019re going to play that young of a quarterback,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cYou could play freshmen. You just got to be really cautious with them. My guess would be \u2014 I didn\u2019t study at all \u2014 but from what I hear from everybody ... that he probably wasn\u2019t ready to go in when he got put in.\u201d\n\nFranks looked like he was making progress in September, but he turned the ball over six times during a four-game stretch \u2014 Florida\u2019s defense and a couple few trick plays essentially won games against Mississippi State and LSU \u2014 and then had his lowest completion percentage and QB rating of the season against Mizzou.\n\n\u201cWe were looking at it this morning and you could see if all 10 guys do everything they\u2019re supposed to and one guy doesn\u2019t, it kind of screws it up for everybody,\u201d receiver Josh Hammond said. \u201cSo it just comes down to execution and everybody giving their all every single play. You can\u2019t take a play off \u2019cause that one play might be the play that changes the game, might be the play that scores a big touchdown.\u201d\n\nFranks has 16 touchdown passes and six interceptions in his second season as a starter.\n\nHe played in 11 games last year, with eight starts, and finished with nine touchdown passes and eight interceptions. He has now been benched three times.\n\n\u201cYou want to put guys in position to try to do things that they can do, so they can build confidence,\u201d Mullen said. In \u201c2006, Tim Tebow played barely at all. Now he got an awful lot of attention on the six plays a game that he played. But that led to him being confident to go win the Heisman Trophy the next year.\n\n\u201cHe played. He\u2019d been in big games. He\u2019d been in big moments. He\u2019d been experienced. He\u2019d been on the field. He\u2019d gone through a season as the backup to learn the system. ... I think that\u2019s such a huge factor.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "CENTRAL ISLIP, N.Y.

(AP) \u2014 The last barber shop in the town of Brattleboro might have to close.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not for lack of business at Mac\u2019s Barber Shop on Putney Road.\n\nMary Jane Giroux has been giving haircuts and shaves to Brattleboro area men for 30 years and she wants to retire.\n\nShe turns 70 next March, but she can\u2019t hire a barber to save the business she founded with her friend Christine Nadeau. Their initials make up the shop\u2019s name. Nadeau passed away in 2005.\n\n\u201cWe wanted something that sounded masculine,\u201d she said.\n\nGiroux says she and her daughter Anne Murphy are swamped with business, but that she cannot find someone to join the business. She said she is even willing to pay for the $15,000 tuition to send someone to barber school, which lasts 10 to 12 months, in exchange for a commitment. The closest barber school is two hours away from Brattleboro, she said.\n\n\u201cI could use two barbers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are very busy.\u201d The shop also has a part-time barber, Michael West.\n\nGiroux has tried the traditional methods of getting the word out, and has even offered a $1,000 \u201cfinder\u2019s fee\u201d to someone who could put her in touch with someone who would cut hair and give shaves at her shop.\n\nGiroux runs a traditional shop, with an antique barber pole in the front window.\n\nThe closest school is in Massachusetts or New Hampshire, although the O\u2019Brien Aveda Institute in Williston, a well-known cosmetology school, also has a barber curriculum.\n\nBarber shops are different from hair salons, Giroux points out, and require \u201ctotally different licenses.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery different skills,\u201d said Giroux, who herself graduated from the Keene Beauty Academy.\n\nAt the barbering academy, she said, \u201cyou learn everything you need to know.\u201d\n\nFor one, barbers don\u2019t handle hair chemicals, such as coloring or permanents or straightening. They usually don\u2019t offer shampoos, although they can.\n\nThey do \u201cstraight razor shaves and hot towels and hot lather,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do neck shaves,\u201d she said.\n\nThe most popular cut now is \u201cThe Fade,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2033\u2018Tight on the sides, longer on the top,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nThey do beard trims and \u201cline-ups,\u201d she said.\n\nCosmetologists can\u2019t use a razor, by license, and can only trim a beard or mustache using scissors.\n\nOn the other hand, barbers can\u2019t do manicures.\n\n\u201cI have hundreds and hundreds of clients that depend on us,\u201d she said. But many hands-on trades are dying, she said.\n\nBarbers can make a good living, starting off early in the \u201chigh 20s, low 30s,\u201d with tips extra. And there are a lot of female barbers, she said.\n\nAccording to Giroux, they don\u2019t charge as much as hair salons for a simple shave or haircut or both, because they work more quickly.\n\nThey trim eyebrows and nose hair, she said.\n\n\u201cWe clean them up and we make them feel good,\u201d she said. And they listen, a lot. \u201cWe\u2019re a therapist for a lot of people,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother barber shop tradition: It\u2019s first-come-first-served, no appointments.\n\nBrattleboro at one time supported five or six different barbershops, she said. She started work with Harold Mayhew, after raising her children.\n\nGiroux came from a family of 16 children. \u201cI\u2019ve always worked hard. I was raised to work,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter graduating from St. Michael\u2019s High School in Brattleboro, she got a job at The Book Press, \u201clike everybody else.\u201d\n\nAfter her children were grown, she had to decide whether to go to nursing school or be a hairdresser.\n\nAfter cosmetology school, she apprenticed with Mayhew, who ran \u201cHarold The Barber\u201d shop in downtown Brattleboro.\n\n\u201cI worked for him for years,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d said Giroux, looking around her shop, which has four barber chairs, including one in the shape of a horse for children. There\u2019s a Snoopy hairdryer on the stand.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much potential.\u201d\n\nClosing the shop is something she doesn\u2019t want to do.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t do that to the people in the town,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2FhMNAL\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Brattleboro Reformer, http://www.reformer.com/", "Vice President Mike Pence addresses the crowd as the featured speaker at the Get Out The Vote Rally at the Glacier Park International Airport on Monday, November 5, in Kalispell, Montana.

(AP) \u2014 When Cesar Ruiz left New Jersey to visit IMG Academy in Florida, his mother said he wasn\u2019t coming back home.\n\nRuiz was not prepared for a long stay during the visit the summer before his junior year of high school. He figured the plan was to fly there with his mother to talk with coaches and check the place out before returning to figure out the next steps.\n\n\u201cIf I had packed enough clothes, I would\u2019ve stayed,\u201d Ruiz recalled Monday. \u201cI went back home because I had to make sure I got everything I wanted and needed.\u201d\n\nRuiz said his mother, Latoya Shambry, didn\u2019t want him to be with her in Camden, New Jersey, because it was a dangerous place to live and he could thrive at IMG in Bradenton, Florida.\n\nIt\u2019s all worked out for Ruiz, the starting center for No. 4 Michigan. He will be back in New Jersey this weekend, playing about an hour away from home as the Wolverines (8-1, 6-0 Big Ten, No. 5 CFP ) visit Rutgers (1-8, 0-6) on Saturday. Ruiz said a lot of familiar faces will be there.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty rough in Camden with crime and violence,\u201d he said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want me in that area when I was getting scholarship offers and I had started to make a name for myself. Once I told her I had an opportunity to leave, she made sure I got away.\u201d\n\nRuiz is popular back home among friends and family only in part because they can potentially get free tickets. There\u2019s more to the affection people have for Ruiz back there and at Michigan. He always seems to be smiling.\n\n\u201cCaesar\u2019s personality is one that everybody enjoys, very enthusiastic every day,\u201d coach Jim Harbaugh said. \u201cVery gung-ho guy. Very popular with the players. Very respectful to the coaches and the staff. The center position is one of leadership and making calls and adjustments and he\u2019s been outstanding.\u201d\n\nOffensive line coach Ed Warinner said Ruiz has developed a lot since his first start at center in the season-opening loss at Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cYou love having him in the middle because you know he can hold up,\u201d Warinner said. \u201cHe\u2019s gotten better at pulling because he\u2019s so athletic that we\u2019re starting to do that more with him. He\u2019s on track to be an All-Big Ten player this season and he\u2019ll play in the NFL someday if he keeps getting better.\u201d\n\nThe Ruiz-led line has allowed running back Karan Higdon to have a seven-game streak with at least 100 yards rushing this season. The group up front has also given Shea Patterson time to pass to help the Wolverines strike a run-pass balance.\n\nWhile many wondered last summer if the offensive line would be a weakness, as it has been in recent years, Ruiz predicted the unit would become strength before the season started.\n\n\u201cWhen I said that, I meant it and it\u2019s happening,\u201d Ruiz said.\n\nMichigan has worn down its last eight opponents, running behind the 6-foot-4, 319-pound Ruiz and four teammates at least that big.

(AP) \u2014 Two Upper Valley ambulance companies are making house calls these days, with the philosophy that a preventive visit may help avoid an emergency call down the road.\n\nThe EMTs and paramedics are helping primary care providers monitor patients, especially those with a chronic disease, and also can spot hazards that may cause a problem later.\n\nIncidents such as falls, for example, can result in unnecessary harm to patients and tax the emergency medical system, Geisel School of Medicine student Karissa LeClair said in a phone interview last week.\n\nLeClair, who also is an emergency medical technician, said responders sometimes might be tied up responding to a fall in a home that lacked railings instead of being available when another emergency call, such as one for a heart attack, comes through.\n\nEarly intervention is \u201cbetter in terms of efficiency of the system,\u201d LeClair said.\n\nTo intervene before patients need to call 911, LeClair and fellow Geisel student Nicholas Valentini, also an EMT, have worked with Dartmouth-Hitchcock\u2019s Lyme clinic and Upper Valley Ambulance to create a pilot project in which paramedics use downtime between emergency calls to visit patients in Orford and Piermont.\n\nDuring these visits, paramedic Stephen Sanborn might examine potential safety hazards in the home, draw blood, give fluids, offer flu shots or check medication. If questions about a patient\u2019s care arise, the paramedic will communicate with primary care providers at the Lyme clinic through a shared electronic medical record, said Clay Odell, executive director of Fairlee-based Upper Valley Ambulance.\n\nWhen Sanborn is unavailable to visit patients in the program, Odell, who in addition to being a paramedic is a registered nurse, fills in.\n\nThe goal is to keep rural patients, especially those with chronic illnesses, \u201cas healthy as we can for as long as we can and keep them in their home,\u201d Odell said.\n\nBy checking on patients regularly, from as often as every couple of days for a more acute issue to every three weeks for a regular monitoring visit, Odell said the paramedic aims to \u201cnotice if there\u2019s any decline.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Geisel students\u2019 pilot community paramedicine project, which began operations about seven months ago, First Branch Ambulance, which serves Chelsea, Tunbridge and South Washington, Vt., has in recent years been offering preventive house calls to patients. First Branch recently formalized its relationship with the Chelsea Health Center, which is operated by the Randolph-based Gifford Health Care, through a memorandum of understanding.\n\nThe two programs operate under different models, First Branch deploys EMTs, who are able to provide basic life supportive care such as CPR, providing oxygen and administering glucose to diabetics; and Upper Valley Ambulance deploys paramedics, who have more advanced training in administering medications, starting intravenous lines and providing advanced airway management.\n\nBut both are examples of trends in emergency medical services care around the country.\n\n\u201cI think this is where EMS is going,\u201d said Nick Mercuri, chief of strategy and planning for the New Hampshire Department of Safety\u2019s Division of Fire Standards and Training and EMS. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting area for us ... to help our communities in a way that we don\u2019t traditionally do.\u201d\n\nOther examples of paramedics doing preventive work in New Hampshire include the safe station programs in Manchester and Nashua that invite those struggling with addiction to come to fire stations for a medical evaluation and referral to treatment. Along similar lines, the Granite State recently received a four-year, $3 million grant from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to support additional opioid prevention work, Mercuri said.\n\nThe funds have not yet been awarded to local emergency service providers, but Mercuri said the idea will be that providers will go out to the homes of people referred to the program and considered at risk of overdose. They will train residents in the home in basic CPR and teach them how to administer naloxone, an overdose reversal drug. In addition, they will try to connect people struggling with addiction with appropriate treatment services.\n\nOverall, the goal is to \u201ckeep people out of the hospital through a visit at home,\u201d Mercuri said. \u201d... Or, with the opioids, trying to get them to where they need to go.\u201d\n\nRight now, the EMS services in the Upper Valley are not being reimbursed for the home visits. But the prevention programs may, eventually, provide a source of revenue for struggling EMS providers, Dan Batsie, Vermont\u2019s chief of EMS, said last week. Community paramedicine programs are one way to demonstrate the value that such providers can add to a community in hopes that someday they will get paid for these prevention efforts, Batsie said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the chicken or the egg debate,\u201d Batsie said.\n\nPeople with poorly treated chronic conditions can be heavy users of emergency services and can have a big impact, especially on a small service, Batsie said. Community paramedicine programs can help to reduce that usage, he said.\n\nThere are some patients who aren\u2019t sick enough to be in a hospital or to qualify for care from visiting nurses, but they still would benefit from someone looking in on them, Batsie said.\n\nOne such patient is 94-year-old Orford resident Virginia Leon, who lives with her daughter Marie Brygider. Since last winter, Sanborn has been visiting their home regularly to check on Leon, who has a variety of medical conditions including rheumatoid arthritis and cellulitis.\n\nLeon\u2019s arthritis makes it difficult for her to get out of her house and into a car to get to doctor\u2019s appointments, Brygider said.\n\n\u201cShe still will have to go for her annual exams,\u201d Brygider said. \u201cIn the meantime, Steve can keep track of how she\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nSo far, Leon\u2019s vital signs have been fairly consistent, and the interactions with Sanborn have been pleasant, Brygider said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very nice,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s very thorough.\u201d\n\nWhile the services Sanborn provides are within his range of practice as paramedic, Odell said Sanborn prepares in advance to treat each patient\u2019s condition by reading up on it in a nursing textbook.\n\nWhile paramedics know what medications a patient with emphysema needs in order to survive an emergency trip to the hospital, they may not know what medications such a patient requires on a day to day basis, Odell said.\n\n\u201cI want the community paramedics to have essentially the same level of knowledge for a particular case as a med/surg nurse,\u201d he said.\n\nProviders at both Upper Valley Ambulance and First Branch said they do not want to step on the toes of the visiting nurses or community nurses who also make home visits. Instead, the ambulance services said they aim to fill in the gaps where these groups aren\u2019t able to provide services and when families need help.\n\n\u201cWe feel like we provide another piece of the puzzle so the patients don\u2019t necessarily fall through the cracks,\u201d Odell said.\n\nThe programs also help the ambulance crew get to know the people in their communities before they show up for an emergency, First Branch EMT Chase Ackerman said.\n\n\u201cYou know ahead of time, before you get there, what their normal status is,\u201d he said.\n\nIn such cases, Ackerman said he knows whether a patient has an advanced directive or a do not resuscitate order.\n\nIt \u201cgives you a lot of direction dealing with people,\u201d he said.\n\nFor now, First Branch has a group of about 15 people who the ambulance crew visits, some more regularly than others, Ackerman said.\n\nUpper Valley Ambulance sees seven patients regularly, most every other week, Odell said. Sanborn fits in the preventive visits between the average of three emergency calls per day, Odell said.\n\nIn the near future, Odell said he\u2019d like to expand the pilot program to some of the ambulance service\u2019s Vermont towns, probably Fairlee and West Fairlee.\n\nAt least one other ambulance crew in the Upper Valley also is thinking about prevention. In Lebanon, ambulance crews have begun asking patients, particularly those at the city\u2019s senior living facilities, to sign voluntary referral forms after calls for which they decline to be transported to the hospital, Fire Chief Chris Christopoulos said.

(AP Photo/Butch Dill)\n\nMETAIRIE, La. (AP) \u2014 Saints coach Sean Payton expressed concern on Monday that his first-place team eventually will falter if it fails to improve the way it defends snaps from within 20 yards of its own goal line.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of football left,\u201d said Payton, whose Saints (7-1) are riding a seven-game winning streak as they prepare to travel to Cincinnati (5-3). \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of things we have to improve on and we need to improve on, or it\u2019s going to hurt us later. Red zone defense \u2014 that has to get better.\u201d\n\nWhile Payton emphasized that there are a number of corrections that need to be made from week to week, a half-season\u2019s worth of poor numbers on red zone snaps is \u201cthe one area that is bothering me.\u201d\n\nSaints opponents have scored touchdowns on 20 of 28 drives (71.4 percent) that have included at least one play run from inside the Saints 20. That ranks 28th out of 32 teams in defensive red zone efficiency.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t find any team having success later in the season with the numbers that we currently have,\u201d Payton warned. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to improve that.\u201d\n\nPayton\u2019s caution comes even as his team holds the inside track to the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs following a 45-35 victory over the previously unbeaten Los Angeles Rams on Sunday. In that game, the Rams ran red-zone plays on five separate possessions. Three of those drives ended with touchdowns, one ended with a field goal and another ended when the Rams were stopped just short of a first down on a fake field goal.\n\nTechnically, that represented an improvement in defensive red-zone efficiency relative to the club\u2019s percentage over eight games. It just wasn\u2019t good enough to allay Payton\u2019s anxiety.\n\nBecause the Saints are scoring nearly 35 points per game, they\u2019re likely to win even if their defense gives up a lot of yards, as long as it thrives at stopping opponents short of the end zone and forcing field goals \u2014 or creating turnovers.\n\nLinebacker Damario Davis said the key to improving in the red zone is preparing better during the week for the plays that upcoming opponents have been most adept at running in that area of the field.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to understanding how teams want to attack you down there and being locked into what they\u2019re going to try to do,\u201d Davis said. \u201cKnowing your assignment and doing your assignment \u2014 I just think it comes down to that.\u201d\n\nBut Davis also suggested that the Saints defense won\u2019t want to become so preoccupied with its red zone play that it neglects other aspects of the game plan.\n\n\u201cWe have our goals every week. All of them are important,\u201d Davis said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be good in the red zone. You\u2019ve got to be good on third down. You\u2019ve got to be good on first and second down in the pass game. You\u2019ve got to stop the run. You\u2019ve got to find a way to get takeaways. Those are our goals every week.

(AP Photo/Steve Helber)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Pittsburgh coach Pat Narduzzi didn\u2019t throw the ACC Coastal Division standings up on the wall during his team\u2019s annual Sunday night meeting.\n\nThere was no need. Narduzzi is well aware his players know where the Panthers (5-4, 4-1 ACC) sit heading into Saturday\u2019s visit from Virginia Tech (4-4, 3-2): in first place and in control of their own destiny.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to address it,\u201d Narduzzi said Monday. \u201cThere\u2019s still a bunch of hungry teams sitting below us. Doesn\u2019t really matter. I know they read on Twitter all that stuff. I guess I don\u2019t have to address it.\u201d\n\nMaybe, but that it\u2019s even a topic of discussion is a testament to Pitt\u2019s resiliency.\n\nNarduzzi raised eyebrows when he told a group of fans at a kickoff luncheon in August to keep the first weekend of December open so they could plan a trip to Charlotte for the ACC title game. It\u2019s a possibility that seemed remote at best after the Panthers were drilled by Penn State and Central Florida and then suffered a baffling loss to North Carolina, all in September.\n\nAnd yet the Panthers have responded brilliantly, winning shootouts and defensive struggles alike during their three-game conference winning streak. Their taut 23-13 victory at Virginia last Friday may have been the closest they have come all season to fitting Narduzzi\u2019s definition of \u201cPitt football.\u201d\n\nDarrin Hall ran for 229 yards and three touchdowns. The defense sacked Virginia quarterback Bryce Perkins five times. Alex Kessman drilled a 53-yard field goal and the Panthers pushed the Cavaliers around on the road.\n\n\u2033(It\u2019s) kind of what you want,\u201d Narduzzi said. \u201d(An) old-school game. That\u2019s who we are, what the city of Pittsburgh is.\u201d\n\nStill, Narduzzi stressed it\u2019s far too early for the Panthers to think they\u2019ve arrived.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go. Premature victories are no good.\u201d\n\nThe road to the ACC championship, however, doesn\u2019t look quite as daunting as it did six weeks ago. Virginia Tech\u2019s bumpy resume includes losses to Old Dominion, Georgia Tech and Boston College. Wake Forest will play the rest of the year without injured starting quarterback Sam Hartman and Miami \u2014 the preseason pick to roll in the Coastal \u2014 is closer to last place than to first.\n\nAll of which makes Pitt the favorite \u2014 or the closest thing to one \u2014 at getting a shot at the ACC\u2019s Atlantic Division champion on Dec. 1. Heady territory for a group that has faced one of the most difficult schedules around.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has played five Top 25 football teams in the country, which we have,\u201d Narduzzi said. \u201cWe faced five of them so far. Wasn\u2019t an easy schedule. Everybody knew it wasn\u2019t an easy schedule coming into the year. After the game is over, no one says, \u2018But it\u2019s a hard schedule.\u2019 What other way would you want it?\u201d\n\nNarduzzi isn\u2019t too concerned about his team getting caught up in the hype. Facing the Hokies should be enough. Pitt had a chance to win in Blacksburg last year but lost 20-14 when it failed to score on four plays from the Virginia Tech 1 in the final moments, a defeat that ultimately prevented the Panthers from becoming bowl eligible and one that Narduzzi still finds himself replaying in his mind 12 months later.\n\nPitt has a chance to erase that memory on Saturday while inching closer to an improbable division title. Not that Narduzzi wants to talk about it. He\u2019d rather his team just go out and play and worry about what it all means later.\n\nHe didn\u2019t change the way the Panthers practiced when they were struggling in September. He\u2019s not going to change anything now that they\u2019re rolling in November.\n\n\u201cWe do what we do, offensively, defensively, structurally,\u201d Narduzzi said. \u201cOur days don\u2019t change. We try to keep things as similar, as familiar with the kids as we possibly can.\u201d\n\nEven as they prepare for a potential trip to unfamiliar territory.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "How major US stock indexes fared Monday\n\nU.S. stocks rose Monday as financial and health care companies finished higher, but Apple and technology companies continued to fall.

(AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim)\n\nIndonesian officials are providing the strongest hints yet that a faulty airspeed indicator played a role in the deadly crash of a Lion Air jet into the Java Sea.\n\nInvestigators said Monday that one of the so-called black boxes showed that the airspeed indicator on the Boeing jet malfunctioned on its last four flights, including the Oct. 29 crash that killed all 189 people on board.\n\nAirspeed indicators have been around for decades to tell pilots how fast they are flying. They are paired with separate indicators measuring the degree to which the nose is pointed up, down or level.\n\nModern jetliners have redundant measurements to help pilots spot and disregard a single reading that looks unlikely and possibly erroneous.\n\nSpeed-measuring systems consist of tubes and sensors that measure air pressure generated by the plane\u2019s movement and compare it with surrounding air pressure. They fail occasionally, especially in bad weather at high altitude, when the tubes located under the plane\u2019s nose can become jammed with ice, preventing air from reaching the sensors. The Oct. 29 Lion Air flight took off in good weather.\n\nFrozen pitot tubes were blamed for the 2009 crash of Air France Flight 447, which killed all 228 people on board. The year before, the U.S. Air Force said moisture in sensors caused the 2008 crash of a B-2 stealth bomber on Guam; both pilots ejected safely. In 2015, a wasp nest plugged the sensors on an Allegiant Air jet leaving St. Petersburg, Florida, forcing pilots to cut the flight short and land in Orlando.\n\nPilots train in simulators to learn how to notice potentially faulty readings and work around them. They learn the normal power settings and attitude, or nose-up and nose-down settings, for each of the various phases of a flight. A problem with the airspeed system should not result in a crash under most circumstances, according to safety experts.\n\n\u201cIf you were driving down the interstate and the speedometer failed, would you expect to crash the car?\u201d said John Cox, a former airline pilot and now a safety consultant. He said a faulty airspeed system might have contributed to the crash, but that based on what we know so far, it shouldn\u2019t be considered the cause of the crash.\n\nSafety experts said investigators will look at why Lion Air didn\u2019t ground the plane if it experienced recurring problems with the sensors and subject it to more rigorous inspection and testing until the problem was fixed.\n\nAlan Diehl, a pilot and safety consultant, said the report that the same problem happened four times and was never fixed suggests that the problem may have been intermittent, making it harder to pin down.\n\n\u201cIntermittent failures are very difficult for maintenance personnel to trouble-shoot because a lot of times they just say, \u2018Cannot duplicate,\u2019 and they write it up that way,\u201d Diehl said.\n\nThe pilots\u2019 actions will also be studied. Data transmitted from the plane and captured by flightradar24.com indicates that the plane continued flying at high speed away from the airport to which they intended to return, which Cox said seemed unusual.\n\nThe data transmissions \u2014 which will have to be confirmed through comparison with information from the plane\u2019s black boxes \u2014 also show that a moderate reduction in altitude turned into a dramatic rate of descent, a loss of control.\n\nCox said that once investigators have all the data, they will work backward to determine if there was a problem with one of the plane\u2019s systems or if pilot decisions put the plane in peril.\n\n\u201cWe know that three other crews faced a similar challenge in this airplane and they landed successfully,\u201d he said, referring to the findings of airspeed indicator malfunctions on four flights including the fatal one.\n\nIn a modern jet like the Boeing Max 8 that crashed, readings from airspeed sensors are processed by a computerized \u201cflight management system\u201d and sent to displays in the cockpit. They also have analog backup systems.\n\nDespite all their training in flying without airspeed indicators, however, pilots can become unnerved when confronted by failure of a system that they count on. Some experts believe the hazard has increased with today\u2019s highly automated cockpits.\n\nIn the Air France accident, all three primary and two backup airspeed-reading systems failed. \u201cThe crew got saturated trying to figure out why their computers weren\u2019t working, and they quit flying the airplane,\u201d said William Waldock, who teaches accident investigation at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.\n\nDivers have recovered one of Lion Air Flight 610\u2032s two black boxes, the flight data recorder. They have not yet found the other one, which captures conversations in the cockpit and ambient sounds such as a change in engine noise.\n\n\u201cThey need to find that cockpit voice recorder,\u201d Waldock said, \u201cbecause that is going to tell us what the crew did in response to whatever situation they had.\u201d\n\n___\n\nDavid Koenig can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter", "FILE - In this Oct. 6, 2018, file photo, Alabama defensive lineman Quinnen Williams puts the pressure on Arkansas quarterback Ty Storey in the second half of an NCAA college football game, in Fayetteville, Ark.

(AP Photo/Michael Woods, File)\n\nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) \u2014 The offensive questions kept coming for Alabama coach Nick Saban at his latest news conference.\n\nDid you create such a different kind of offensive team by design? How has the offense evolved since the opener? Talk about the offensive line, the receivers.\n\nThe top-ranked Crimson Tide still plays defense , too, if not with quite the same smothering dominance of past years.\n\nAlabama heads into Saturday\u2019s game with No. 18 Mississippi State fresh from its first shutout of the season, 29-0 over No. 9 LSU .\n\n\u201cEverybody talks about the offense and not a lot about the defense,\u201d Tide cornerback Xavier McKinney said Monday. \u201cWe try to put everybody on notice. We have something to prove when we go out there.\u201d\n\nBefore the emergence of quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, it was typically the other way around. The defense not only dominated opposing offenses, but got much of the credit for Alabama\u2019s five national titles under coach Nick Saban. The offense mostly played second fiddle, especially the passing game.\n\nNow, Alabama is leading the nation in scoring and total offense and has already secured a spot against No. 5 Georgia in the Southeastern Conference championship game.\n\nDefensively, a drop-off might have been inevitable after losing first-round NFL draft picks Minkah Fitzpatrick, Da\u2019Ron Payne and Rashaan Evans, along with five other selections.\n\nThe Tide has ranked in the top 10 in both rushing and scoring defense each of the past 10 seasons and led the nation in both categories the past two years. Now, Alabama is seventh in scoring defense and 11th against the run.\n\n\u201cYards are hard to come by against this defense, whether it\u2019s on the ground or in the air,\u201d Mississippi State coach Joe Moorhead said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be able to string together multiple 12-, 13- or 15-play drives and make your way down field.\n\n\u201cAt a certain point, you have to take a chance with a shot downfield or a trick play or something that\u2019s going to generate a chunk of yards.\u201d\n\nThis Alabama defense still has plenty of star power and award candidates in players like nose guard Quinnen Williams , defensive end Isaiah Buggs, safety Deionte Thompson and linebackers Dylan Moses and Mack Wilson.\n\nAlabama held LSU to 196 total yards, including just 12 rushing. It was a vintage Tide performance even it was mostly overshadowed \u2014 of course \u2014 by Tagovailoa\u2019s exploits.\n\n\u201cThey were in the backfield all night,\u201d Alabama offensive tackle Jedrick Wills Jr. said.\n\nThe defense is still producing plenty of big plays. Buggs is fifth nationally with nine sacks and the team ranks fourth nationally in that category.\n\nA secondary that had to replace last year\u2019s top six players, including the versatile All-American defensive back Fitzpatrick, has emerged too. Alabama has 13 interceptions and has returned four of them for touchdowns.\n\nThompson is the team\u2019s leading tackler.\n\nPlus, the Tide has allowed just 37.7 rushing yards on average over the last three SEC games with Williams stepping in for Payne and also consistently generating a pass rush up the middle.\n\nMoses and Wilson have emerged as standouts at inside linebacker in Evans\u2019 absence.\n\nThe defense has allowed somewhat uncharacteristic numbers at times: 23 points to Texas A&M, 31 to Arkansas and 21 to Tennessee.\n\nSaban said the young defenders have gained confidence along with the experience and gotten better at things like playing together and communicating.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve grown in some of those areas, and we need to continue to improve in all parts of our team,\u201d Saban said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see a different kind of attack this week, so we\u2019re going to have to adjust and adapt to that as well.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer David Brandt contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Ohio State forward Micah Potter is transferring two days before Buckeyes\u2019 season opener.\n\nThe university announced the decision Monday but did not say to what school the 6-foot-9 junior was going.\n\nPotter dealt with ankle injuries his first two years and has not met expectations that he would become a dominant inside player.\n\nPotter, of Mentor, Ohio, appeared in 59 games with 16 starts, averaging 4.1 points and 2.8 rebounds while shooting 46 percent.\n\nThe Buckeyes open Wednesday at Cincinnati.", "This screenshot shows a webpage for the campaign of Nevada Sen.

It means lacking a thorn or quite literally a spine, an idiom that becomes an absurdity in Spanish.\n\nHer campaign said it has several staff members who are fluent in Spanish, including some for whom it is their first language \u201cand ensure translations include appropriate cultural context.\u201d\n\nJudy Jenner, an adjunct professor of translation and interpretation at the University of California San Diego-Extension, said hiring a translator is key since professionals will translate meaning, not just words, and are intimately familiar with cultural contexts and nuances.\n\nShe added people oftentimes wrongly assume bilingual people are translators.\n\n\u201cThink about it: I am quite certain that a significant amount of thought and discussion went into every single word of the English-language message that candidates send out to potential voters.

It has also become a haven for armed groups, including several from neighboring countries, which survive on looting and human trafficking.\n\nThe Netherlands and Sweden pushed for including \u201cplanning, directing or committing acts involving sexual and gender-based violence\u201d as criteria for sanctions, citing the increasingly worrying problem in Libya especially against migrants trying to reach Europe.\n\nDutch Ambassador Karel Van Oostrom told the council after the vote that such violence \u201cis directly connected to the issues of peace and security we are discussing today.\u201d\n\nRussian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia strongly disagreed, saying sexual and gender-based violence is a crime that is dealt with by national governments and is considered at the U.N.

It is not a threat to international peace and security that the Security Council should deal with, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are under the impression that the countries pushing this into the Security Council agenda are attempting to gain domestic political capital through the imposition of sanctions regimes against other states,\u201d Nebenzia said. \u201cThe facts of such crimes perpetrated against migrants in Libya only confirm our premise that the most effective means of combatting this scourge is eradicating the relevant criminal networks.\u201d\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador Jonathan Cohen said the resolution should have been adopted unanimously and \u201cbe sending a clear message to the Libyan people \u2014 that we are united behind you and that we on the Security Council will hold Libyan spoilers to account for their actions.\u201d\n\nIn June, the Security Council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on six leaders of criminal networks engaged in human trafficking and migrant smuggling from Libya, and in September it slapped sanctions on Libyan militia leader Ibrahim Jadran for attacking Libyan oil facilities in the summer.\n\nThe resolution adopted Monday extended authorization for U.N. member states to board suspect vessels and return illegally seized oil to the Libyan government until Feb. 15, 2020.

Solis)\n\nMississippi\u2019s football program has earned the reputation of one that plays extremely hard and can occasionally put a bunch of points on the scoreboard.\n\nUnfortunately for the Rebels, it hasn\u2019t stopped them from becoming one of the worst teams in the Southeastern Conference.\n\nOle Miss (5-4, 1-4 SEC) continued a disappointing season last weekend when it lost 48-44 on its home field to South Carolina . The elements that have defined the past two months were there: Great effort, good offense, bad-to-terrible defense.\n\nAnd \u2014 ultimately \u2014 another disappointing loss.\n\n\u201cThe attention to detail is what it takes to get over the hump,\u201d Ole Miss coach Matt Luke said. \u201cYou can look at a thousand different plays from that game, the explosive plays, the turnovers in the red zone, but it\u2019s the attention to detail that we have to focus on. The little things it takes to win.\n\n\u201cThe line is very, very small in the Southeastern Conference for winning football games.\u201d\n\nMore and more, the Rebels have been on the wrong side of that line, and they\u2019ll be sizable underdogs when they go on the road to face Texas A&M (5-4, 3-3) on Saturday.\n\nOle Miss\u2019 struggles aren\u2019t exactly surprising. There\u2019s been a malaise surrounding the program for at least three years, ever since it because apparent that an NCAA investigation into rules violations could bring serious trouble. It\u2019s about that time the Rebels started to lose more football games, too.\n\nThe fallout continued throughout 2017. Coach Hugh Freeze \u2014 who led the program to a Sugar Bowl win in 2015 \u2014 resigned because of a pattern of personal misconduct and the program was later hit with a two-year bowl ban and other penalties related to the NCAA case.\n\nIn many ways, Luke has done a good job just to keep the Rebels from crashing to rock bottom. He had a 6-6 record as the interim coach in 2017, which earned him the full-time job.\n\nOle Miss started this season with a 5-2 record, giving some brief optimism that the Rebels might be competitive again in the SEC. The offense has several talented players, led by quarterback Jordan Ta\u2019amu, receiver A.J. Brown and running back Scottie Phillips.\n\nBut most of those early wins were against weak out-of-conference opponents. Recent losses to Auburn and South Carolina have put the program face-to-face with the reality that this is probably a long rebuilding project.\n\nThe Rebels are still drawing decent crowds, but optimism is waning.\n\nThe 42-year-old Luke has managed to stay positive throughout the ups-and-downs. Ole Miss did get some good news last week when it learned that some of the NCAA penalties related to recruiting restrictions had been reversed after the school appealed the initial ruling .\n\nMore than anything, Ole Miss is happy to be free of an NCAA case that lasted about six years.\n\nNow the Rebels are free to focus on future improvement.\n\n\u201cJust to put everything behind us \u2014 it\u2019s over,\u201d Luke said. \u201cAll the recruiting restrictions are lifted, there are no more bowl bans, let\u2019s move forward and go attack this thing and see the big picture.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP .\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 .", "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A long-delayed major development project in downtown Los Angeles is finally moving forward.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reports Monday that Related Companies has secured $630 million in construction financing from German lender Deutsche Bank for a massive retail, entertainment and hotel project called the Grand.\n\nWork will begin this month on the Frank Gehry-designed project, which will replace an old parking structure across Grand Avenue from the gleaming Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall.\n\nThe $1 billion project will have 215,000 square feet (19,974 square meters) of retail space, a 309-room hotel and 436 residences.

But Pollack\u2019s footage proved virtually impossible to edit because the filmmaker failed to sync the sound.

They argued the film was \u201cthe functional equivalent of replaying an entire Aretha Franklin concert,\u201d and couldn\u2019t be screened without her consent.\n\nA Colorado court largely agreed, ruling in 2016 that the concert film didn\u2019t constitute \u201cfair use,\u201d prompting a new round of negotiations.

Pollack died in 2008.\n\nThe late singer\u2019s estate said \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d was an important part of Franklin\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u2033\u2018Amazing Grace\u2019 is the heart and soul of Aretha Franklin,\u201d Sabrina Owens, Franklin\u2019s niece, said Monday. \u201cThis film is authentic and is my aunt at her core.

(AP Photo/Gerry Broome, File)\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Federal authorities violated a federal law aimed at preserving endangered species by planning to shrink the territory of the only red wolves living in the wild, a federal judge ruled in blocking a move that environmentalists said would hasten the animal\u2019s demise.\n\nU.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle ruled in an order signed Sunday that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service also violated the Endangered Species Act by authorizing private landowners to kill the canine predators even if they aren\u2019t threatening humans, livestock or pets.\n\nThe ruling represents a victory for environmental groups who argued in their lawsuit that the federal government neglected the wolves for years and allowed their population to decline. About 35 red wolves remain in the wild, all in eastern North Carolina. They numbered about 120 a decade ago. About 200 live in captive breeding programs.\n\nThe wildlife service announced a plan in June to constrict the wolves\u2019 territory from five counties to federal land in two counties, as well as lifting restrictions on killing wolves that stray from that area. The new rules implementing the plan were set to be finalized by Nov. 30.\n\nSome landowners argue the wolves are nuisance animals that frequently wander onto their farms or scare game animals off hunting land. They also question whether they are a species unto themselves or a hybrid.\n\n\u201cIt is undisputed that the reintroduction of the red wolf into the Red Wolf Recovery Area is not without its challenges, but absent a change in Congress\u2019 mandate or a decision to delist or reclassify the red wolf\u201d from the endangered species list, the wildlife agency\u2019s decisions amount to a failure to uphold its conservation duties, Boyle wrote.\n\nThe groups who filed the lawsuit in 2015 \u2014 the Red Wolf Coalition, Defenders of Wildlife and Animal Welfare Institute \u2014 said the wildlife service\u2019s proposal would reduce the protected range of the red wolves by almost 90 percent. In 2016, a group of 30 scientists condemned such a scenario because the limited area proposed by USFWS could not support a viable population of red wolves and its proposal was inconsistent with the best available science.\n\nIn 2016, Boyle sided with the conservation groups when he issued a preliminary injunction that essentially halted all authorizations for landowners to trap or kill the wolves. Boyle\u2019s ruling Sunday made that injunction permanent.\n\nOnce common across the Southeast, the red wolf had been considered extinct in the wild as of 1980. Releases of captive-bred wolves started in 1987.\n\n____\n\nFollow Emery P. Dalesio on Twitter at http://twitter.com/emerydalesio.

Charlotte limited Tennessee to just 20 yards on 26 carries and held the Vols scoreless after the first quarter.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t block very well,\u201d Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt said. \u201cWe basically got whipped at the point of attack. We had some mental errors that we haven\u2019t been having for quite some time.\u201d\n\nTennessee (4-5, 1-4 SEC) now must try to solve its issues in the running game before its home game Saturday with No. 12 Kentucky (7-2, 5-2).

The Vols hoped an improved offensive line featuring preseason all-SEC selection Trey Smith at tackle and Alabama graduate transfer Brandon Kennedy at center could boost the ground attack this year.\n\nKennedy played just one game before injuring his anterior cruciate ligament , knocking him out for the remainder of the season. Smith is out indefinitely after doctors found blood clots in his lungs, a recurrence of an issue that also prevented him from participating in spring practice .\n\nWithout Kennedy and Smith, Tennessee is searching for the right combination.\n\nTennessee opened the Charlotte game with a line that featured Marcus Tatum at left tackle, Jahmir Johnson at left guard, Ryan Johnson at center, Nathan Niehaus at right guard and Drew Richmond at right tackle. Late in the third quarter, Chance Hall stepped in at right guard with Niehaus moving to right tackle. K\u2019Rojhn Calbert took over at left tackle down the stretch.\n\nThe Vols\u2019 single-game rushing total against Charlotte was their lowest output since being held to zero net yards rushing in a 34-3 loss to Mississippi in 2014 .\n\n\u201cWe had too many mistakes Saturday, which went back to earlier in the year, guys blocking the wrong folks,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to have success when you do that.\u201d\n\nPruitt also said last week that his running backs were \u201cbanged up\u201d without going into specifics. Tennessee\u2019s leading rushers this season are Tim Jordan and Ty Chandler, but they combined for just six of the Vols\u2019 26 carries last week.\n\nTennessee\u2019s health concerns in the backfield have led to some roster shuffling.\n\nThe Vols\u2019 leading rusher against Charlotte was freshman Jeremy Banks, who had switched from running back to linebacker two weeks ago before moving back to offense. Carlin Fils-aime moved from the secondary to running back last month.\n\nWhen Banks started practicing with the running backs again last week, Pruitt said \u201cwe want to make sure that we\u2019ve got enough running backs to finish the year.\u201d\n\nPruitt says he expects all his running backs to be available against Kentucky.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say the health of our running backs is probably like everybody else,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cIt\u2019s November, and everybody has bumps and bruises. All of our guys will be ready to play.\u201d\n\nKentucky coach Mark Stoops remains wary of Tennessee\u2019s offense. Stoops complimented Tennessee\u2019s wide receivers and said they could indirectly help the Vols\u2019 rushing attack.\n\n\u201cAnytime you have the talent at wide receiver that they have, it always makes you conscious of those guys and not leaving your corners in one-on-one situations all day,\u201d Stoops said. \u201cThat could open up opportunities for some big plays in the run game.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had some injuries on the offensive line that I\u2019m sure have not helped them, but they\u2019re a talented and good football team that\u2019s getting better with every game.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Pruitt said safety Trevon Flowers will probably be a \u201cgame-day decision.\u201d A broken collarbone caused Flowers to miss Tennessee\u2019s last four games. ...

Yet that is what Policy Matters Ohio reports in an analysis released last week. What makes things worse is that these households are in position to claim the credits because they benefit from the ill-conceived business income deduction for owners of limited liability companies, S corporations and partnerships known as pass-through entities.\n\nRecall that in 2013, Republicans in charge of the Statehouse approved the business income deduction, which since has been expanded. Advocates pitched the idea as a tool to help businesses expand and create jobs. The pass-through concept refers to business income flowing to the individual for tax purposes. The deduction is generous, allowing an owner to avoid taxes on the first $250,000 in profits and then pay at a reduced 3 percent rate on any remaining income.\n\nWhat Policy Matters reveals is that thousands of taxpayers haven\u2019t stopped there in reducing their tax burden. They have used their reduced liability to claim a handful of means-tested credits and exemptions.\n\nHow? Consider a taxpayer with $150,000 in business income and $30,000 in wages from a job. Apply the business income deduction, and the amount of taxable income is a fraction of the whole. The sum opens the door, depending on the circumstances, to such relief as the child care and dependent care credit, which starts at income below $40,000, or the joint filing credit, also aimed at those with lower incomes.\n\nPolicy Matters explains how some business owners can take advantage of the homestead exemption, which allows for avoiding local property taxes on up to $25,000 of the value of a house. The exemption applies to those with taxable income of $32,200 or less.

Last year, the country had more three times as many murders as the United States, with only two-thirds of the population.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder people yearned for structure and order. The question is what kind of structure and order will Mr. Bolsonaro bring.\n\nHe has spoken approvingly of Brazil\u2019s 1964-1985 military dictatorship. He has made statements derogatory of women and minorities.\n\nHe plans to let the police be more violent with criminals, plans to use the Army in fighting crime, and plans to have more military in his cabinet. An administration under such a president might be prone to want to use the military to enforce a political agenda.\n\nMr. Bolsonaro\u2019s election, his promises to stop the country\u2019s drift toward socialism, sell off state-owned companies, and embrace global trade, while also cracking down on criminal gangs and government corruption, have already spawned a flurry of economic interest in Brazil.\n\nHe can become a hero of political and national growth or he can avoid becoming a caricaturish, intolerant, tinpot dictator. ...\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2JFWDut\n\n___\n\nThe Columbus Dispatch, Nov. 5\n\nWe all can debate whether Campaign 2018 has been any worse \u2014 any more inane or dishonest \u2014 than what\u2019s been typical in recent years.

Even as the dust settles over the $1.5 trillion tax cut Congress passed mainly to the benefit of the wealthiest Americans, Trump told a Texas rally his administration would be \u201cputting in\u201d an additional 10 percent tax cut for middle-income earners. Fact: Only Congress can enact a tax cut, and it isn\u2019t in session.\n\n? A horde of invading aliens is on our doorstep, the president says, so he is sending 15,000 U.S. Army troops to stop them while offering no evidence to support claims that the migrant group is salted with terrorists, rapists and drug dealers. Fact: Journalists who have traveled with the mass of migrants report that they are desperate, exhausted families trying to escape brutal violence in Central America. It remains unclear what the Army troops will do at the border because federal law prohibits them from acting as a police force on U.S. soil.\n\n? Trump will end \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d \u2014 the principle that people born here are U.S. citizens, regardless of their parents\u2019 status \u2014 by executive order. Fact: This right is enshrined in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and change would require either a new constitutional amendment or a drawn-out court battle. ...\n\n... We urge all voters to avoid the caustic rhetoric and lies in all of this year\u2019s campaigning and seek facts and candidates who deal in facts. Voting isn\u2019t easy.

On that day, Bishop George V. Murry and other church leaders released a long-awaited list of 34 names of priests and other church authorities who have been credibly accused of the most horrid and heinous of crimes: sexually abusing minor children.\n\nIn another sense, however, Tuesday rose as the dawn of a new day for the six-county diocese as the results of the intensive investigation could now pave the way for a cleansing of some of the many stains the long-standing sex-abuse scandal have left on the Catholic church in our region, state and nation.\n\nTo be sure, however, the report does not bring full closure to the abominable abuse scandal. The deep psychological wounds of dozens of young children who were victimized at the hands of those on the list even decades ago will continue to fester.\n\nBut knowing that their voices were heard and taken seriously should at least provide those victims some degree of comfort and closure. For the broader church, the report at last lets in a few rays of hope, healing, transparency and accountability in openly acknowledging the many years of aberrant behavior on the part of priests who committed the unseemly acts and on the part of some church leaders who covered up abusive acts or minimized their destructiveness.\n\nIndeed, we were impressed by the sincere candor with which Bishop Murry, leader of the diocese, addressed the sins of the church at his news conference earlier this week.\n\n\u201cI am very sorry that the church has failed to act aggressively to eliminate this evil,\u201d he said in a statement for the diocese. \u201cI humbly ask for forgiveness from the victims and their families for the grave mistakes that the church has made.\u201d\n\nEven when he noted that the scope of documented sex abuse in the diocese covering Mahoning, Trumbull, Columbiana, Ashtabula, Stark and Portage counties falls below that of the national average, he was far from an apologist for the guilty priests and church hierarchy here over the past seven decades.\n\n\u201cWe have to do something to ensure, always, that children are protected,\u201d he said. \u201cOur promise to our people is that this doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nThat is a promise that Bishop Murry and others throughout the diocese must work tirelessly to keep in coming months, years and decades. We and others will be watching.\n\nThey can start by filling in the many blanks left on the list of accused abusers released this week. That list, which was published in The Vindicator on Wednesday, did not include, for example, information on the priests\u2019 parish affiliations, church assignments or what years they served in the active ministry. We therefore hold the church to its pledge that it would today release that detailed information - even against the recommendations of diocesan attorneys who fear it might open floodgates of new accusations. To do otherwise only would fuel additional rumblings of cover-up. ...\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2F4o1np\n\n___", "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The NHL has suspended Winnipeg Jets forward Brendan Lemieux for two games for an illegal check to the head of Florida Panthers forward Vincent Trocheck.\n\nThe incident occurred in the second period of the Panthers\u2019 4-2 win over the Jets on Friday in Helsinki, Finland.

This means they don\u2019t pick each other, which can lead to rocky relations.\n\nMarissa Kerns, the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, said she didn\u2019t attend a KITV televised debate on Oct. 29 because her running mate, state Rep.

Keep it fairly simple but not too simple,\u201d said Gruden, whose team has been at its most successful when Adrian Peterson runs the ball effectively but he had only 17 yards on nine carries against Atlanta. \u201cStill going to challenge our guys to do some great things and hopefully the guys that we sign can fit right in and play.\u201d\n\nAs it is, Washington already was facing injury issues along its line: Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams missed the game against Atlanta after having surgery on his dislocated right thumb and could be out another two or three weeks.\n\nPlus, Morgan Moses\u2019 status is considered day to day, Gruden said, after the starting right tackle hurt the MCL ligament in his right knee against Atlanta but returned to the game after limping off the field in the first half.\n\n\u201cThis is something you don\u2019t want to go through. But it is pro football, and you have to go through it,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cFortunately we have a very good line coach in Coach (Bill) Callahan.\u201d\n\nThings got so bad against Atlanta that the one healthy starting lineman, center Chase Roullier, ran over to the sideline while Scherff was being tended to on the field to check in with Callahan about who should play where.\n\n\u201cJust to figure out where he wanted guys to go,\u201d Roullier said. \u201cMaybe they want me at guard. Maybe they want me at center.\u201d\n\nIt turned out that he stayed at center, but otherwise, the shuffling went like this: Tony Bergstrom, who entered the game at left guard when Lauvao got hurt on the game\u2019s third play, shifted to right guard in place of Scherff; Ty Nsekhe, the backup who started at left tackle in place of Williams, moved to left guard; and rookie third-round draft picks Geron Christian made his NFL debut at left tackle.\n\nWashington essentially was out of linemen at that point, so if another injury had happened, Gruden said defensive end Matt Ioannidis would have been forced to play guard, something he said he\u2019d never done at any level.\n\n\u201cWe were about a hangnail away from that happening,\u201d Roullier said. \u201cThat would have been interesting.\u201d\n\nRichardson\u2019s first season with the Redskins after leaving the Seattle Seahawks as a free agent ends with 20 catches for 262 yards and two TDs.\n\n\u201cPaul\u2019s been dealing with this thing all year,\u201d Gruden said of the AC joint injury. \u201cToughed it out for eight weeks and I think the pain has been bothering him so much that he needs to get it fixed.\u201d\n\nGruden said that starting slot receiver Jamison Crowder, who\u2019s missed four games with an ankle injury, might practice Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "ST.

(AP Photo/Becky Bohrer)\n\nANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 A topsy-turvy governor\u2019s race and a fight for the state\u2019s lone U.S. House seat top the ballot in Alaska.\n\nDemocrat Mark Begich is taking on Republican Mike Dunleavy for governor after the incumbent, Gov. Bill Walker, bowed out.\n\nIn the House race, Republican U.S. Rep. Don Young faces a challenge from independent Alyse Galvin, an education advocate. Galvin hopes to be the first woman to hold the seat Young has held since 1973.\n\nThe election is Tuesday.\n\nGalvin said Alaskans want quality, affordable health care, livable wages and to feel heard by their representative. Young, the longest-serving current member of the House, has played up his seniority and said he\u2019s still excited by the job.\n\nGalvin, who has used social media to raise her profile, waved signs with supporters in Anchorage Monday. The vibe was festive, despite the freezing cold. \u201cI feel hopeful, and I\u2019m encouraged, and I\u2019m proud of the many Alaskans who are seeing how important it is that they become engaged if they care about their future,\u201d she said.\n\nAt a GOP rally Sunday, Young warned of socialism creeping into politics on the national level.\n\n\u201cThis is a great nation. We basically have good people,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t let, I call it the cancer of our society, socialism, take it over.\u201d\n\nVoters\u2019 decisions on legislative races will determine control of the Alaska House and Senate. And Alaskans will decide on a ballot initiative that supporters say will protect salmon habitat but opponents say is too far-reaching and could hamper development.\n\nWalker ended his campaign last month, after Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott resigned over what Walker described as an inappropriate overture to a woman. The two remain on the ballot, since the deadline to withdraw was in September.\n\nBut Walker voted early Friday and said he voted for Begich.\n\nLibertarian Billy Toien also is running for governor.\n\nCrime, the economy and the future of the annual checks Alaska residents receive from the state\u2019s oil-wealth fund, the Alaska Permanent Fund, are major issues in the governor\u2019s race.\n\nDividend checks have been capped since 2016, first by Walker, then by legislators, as they dealt with the deficit. Dividends are paid using fund earnings, which lawmakers this year began using for government expenses, setting the stage for a political fight over the checks.\n\nDunleavy, a former state senator, wants to cut and limit state spending. He said he supports paying residents a full dividend check and paying Alaskans the money they missed out on when checks were capped. Preliminary budget figures suggest that alone could cost about $4.3 billion.\n\nWhile oil prices have moderated, at current prices paying a full dividend now would leave a budget gap and could limit the state\u2019s ability to repay the billions of dollars in reserves the Legislature went through to help plug the deficit, said David Teal, a legislative fiscal analyst. But Dunleavy argues the formula for calculating the dividend should be followed and if changes are proposed, Alaskans should get a say via an advisory vote.\n\nBegich, a former Anchorage mayor and one-term U.S. senator, said the numbers behind Dunleavy\u2019s proposals don\u2019t add up. Begich wants to transfer most of the money in Permanent Fund earnings to the fund\u2019s constitutionally protected principal, to keep lawmakers from looting it. He supports limited withdrawals from the fund based on a percentage of its market value, with part of the money going to dividends and part to education. He wants the dividend constitutionally enshrined.\n\nMarta Mason of Anchorage said she supports Begich, calling him approachable. \u201cI believe he would be a good governor for everyone,\u201d she said after a Sunday church service.\n\nJohn Nelson of Wasilla supports Dunleavy, saying he has vision and integrity.\n\nDunleavy expected to get some help with get-out-the-vote efforts. His campaign manager said robocalls on behalf of Dunleavy would go out from President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.", "No charges in agent\u2019s fatal shooting of man in Lake County\n\nZION, Ill.

(AP) \u2014 Florida State needed to shake things up so Willie Taggart has turned over the play-calling duties to his offensive coordinator.\n\nTaggart said \u201che\u2019s not a big ego guy\u201d and after a rocky start in his first season as the Seminoles (4-5, 2-5 Atlantic Coast Conference) head coach, he opted to let offensive coordinator Walt Bell call plays in the 47-28 loss at North Carolina State. Despite losing, Bell will call the shots against this week against third-ranked Notre Dame (9-0, No. 4 CFP).\n\n\u201cI thought Walt did a good job of calling plays,\u201d Taggart said. \u201cObviously, we didn\u2019t get the win but I thought him doing that was good, and allowing me to see and be a part of other things within our program. I thought I was able to interact with our players a lot better, a lot more on the sidelines when I needed to.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a major change for Taggart, who called the plays in 2015-16 when he was at South Florida and in 2017 at Oregon.\n\nHis USF offense was No. 4 nationally in scoring offense (43.8 points) in 2016 and the Ducks were 18th (36 points) in 2017. Taggart hasn\u2019t had that kind of success with the Seminoles.\n\nFlorida State is 106th in the FBS in scoring (23.8 points), struggling behind an injury-depleted and inconsistent offensive line. The Seminoles have allowed 28 sacks (117th) and the run game has been woeful, averaging just 76.9 yards per game (128th).\n\nBell could provide a needed change-up. He is considered a rising star in the coaching profession because of his dynamic offenses as a play-caller at Arkansas State (2014-15) and Maryland (2016-17). Taggart and Bell had no prior friendship before he was brought to Florida State but the two coaches favor fast-paced, spread offenses.\n\nQuarterback James Blackman made his first start of the season against the Wolfpack, filling in for injured starter Deondre Francois (ribs). Blackman completed 29 of 46 passes while setting career-highs for passing yards (421) and touchdown passes (four).\n\nThe sophomore was accurate in connecting on 19 of 24 passes through the first three quarters but wasn\u2019t able to help the Seminoles rally from a 37-21 deficit in the final quarter.\n\nTaggart said he has not decided if Blackman or Francois will start at Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go through the week and see how Deondre is doing, see how these guys are practicing throughout the week,\u201d Taggart said. \u201cWe\u2019ll make that decision later in the week.\u201d\n\nFlorida State also could be without two of its top offensive linemen. Tackle Landon Dickerson, who has been limited to just two games in 2018 due to an ankle injury, is not ready to return to practice, Taggart said. Guard Cole Minshew (neck stinger) also remains day-to-day.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 Journalist Frank Donze, widely respected in his native New Orleans for covering five mayors and a host of political movers and shakers during 35 years with The Times-Picayune, has died at age 64.\n\nDonze (DAHN\u2019-zee) died Saturday at his home of an apparent heart attack, his brother-in-law, Peter Finney Jr., told Nola.comThe Times-Picayune.\n\nSince 2012, he had been a spokesman for the Audubon Nature Institute.

It has previously said DiGaudio \u201cwas simply trying to get to the truth\u201d and wasn\u2019t trying to influence the investigation.\n\nThree of the five remaining criminal charges against Weinstein stem from allegations he raped a woman in a hotel room in March 2013. They are also tainted by allegations DiGaudio behaved improperly. The two other charges allege Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006 at his Manhattan apartment.\n\nProsecutors dropped a sixth charge, alleging Weinstein forced Lucia Evans to perform oral sex in 2004 when she was a college student and fledgling actress, last month after evidence surfaced that DiGaudio told her friend to keep quiet when she raised doubts about the veracity of the allegations.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said in a letter to Weinstein lawyer Benjamin Brafman that was unsealed on Oct. 11 that DiGaudio had advised the witness that \u201cless is more.\u201d\n\nDays later , Illuzzi-Orbon disclosed an allegation that DiGaudio urged Weinstein\u2019s 2013 rape accuser to delete material from her cellphones before handing them over to prosecutors. She said that the material didn\u2019t pertain to Weinstein and that the woman wound up not deleting anything.\n\nWeinstein, 66, denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex.\n\nWeinstein\u2019s lawyers, in their filing, also again knocked prosecutors for failing to show the grand jury that indicted him evidence they contend undermines the remaining allegations.\n\nRepeating an earlier argument, Weinstein\u2019s lawyers cited warm emails they said the 2013 accuser sent after the date of the alleged attack in which she welcomed plans to get together with Weinstein, sought advice and told him no one \u201cunderstands me quite like you.\u201d\n\nIn a new revelation, Weinstein\u2019s lawyers said the 2006 accuser was also in contact with him after the date she later told authorities she was assaulted. That accuser sent a text message about seven months later seeking to meet with Weinstein, the lawyers said.\n\n\u2033(The accusers) had the temerity to reach out to (Weinstein) and try to engage him in social relationships \u2014 \u2018after\u2019 they now claim he viciously sexually assaulted them,\u201d the lawyers wrote. \u201cThe sheer hypocrisy of the indictment is simply stunning.\u201d\n\nGloria Allred, a lawyer for the 2006 accuser, said in an email that the Weinstein filing was \u201creplete with unjustified speculation\u201d that is \u201ccompletely contradicted by the facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they are engaging in speculation as to my client, I believe that they are lacking in facts which would exculpate their client Mr. Weinstein,\u201d Allred said. \u201cTheir defense of Mr. Weinstein as to my client appears to be built on quicksand rather than on a strong factual foundation.\u201d\n\nAllred\u2019s client, a former film production assistant, went public with her allegations last October but has since said that she wanted to maintain her privacy and preferred that her name not be used.\n\nIn another wrinkle, Weinstein\u2019s lawyers argued that by dropping the Evans-related charge, prosecutors washed away the legal foundation for another charge, predatory sexual assault, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison upon conviction.\n\nThe Associated Press generally does not identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they consent to being identified publicly, as Evans has.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writer Tom Hays contributed to this report.

It was a timely development, as the Buckeyes this week prepare to face the top defense in the country against the run.\n\nJ.K. Dobbins had his best game of the season, rushing for 163 yards and three touchdowns and then picking up two first downs on the final drive to seal the 36-31 win over Nebraska. Mike Weber turned in his best performance since the first game of the season, gaining 91 yards on nine carries.\n\nThe improvement in the run game coincided with Ohio State (8-1, 5-1 Big Ten, No. 10 CFP) all but abandoning run-pass option plays, which are designed for a run or a pass based on the quarterback\u2019s immediate read of the defense. Offensive linemen had acknowledged that those plays made run blocking more difficult.\n\n\u201cThat was part of the hours and hours and hours of (figuring out) how do we get those two guys involved in the game and let them drop their pads and go do what they do best, which is run the ball,\u201d coach Urban Meyer said Monday.\n\nAll five offensive linemen collectively were named offensive players of the game.\n\n\u201cWhen you come to Ohio State you\u2019ve got to be able to run the ball,\u201d right tackle and co-captain Isaiah Prince said. \u201cThat became a chip on my shoulder (Saturday).\u201d\n\nThe Buckeyes this week visit Michigan State (6-3, 4-2), which is holding opponents to an average of 71.7 yards game and 2.53 per carry.

Together Samuel and Moore have run 10 times for 159 yards with two touchdowns on reverses or double reverses. They also have 27 catches for 403 yards and three TDs receiving entering Thursday night\u2019s game at Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re focused, there are no young players that I wouldn\u2019t put those guys up against in this league because they have the physicality, the playmaking ability, and the want-to,\u201d quarterback Cam Newton said of the team\u2019s young dynamic duo.\n\nOn Sunday, it was Samuel who had the bigger impact.\n\nDespite playing only 17 plays, he scored on a 33-yard double reverse, a play in which he reversed field and covered 103 yards on the ground according to the NFL\u2019s NextGen Stats. Later, he made a leaping 19-yard touchdown catch in the end zone with a defender draped all over him to help seal Carolina\u2019s 42-28 win over Tampa Bay .\n\n\u201cHe is just explosive and he is a dynamic playmaker,\u201d Rivera said of Samuel. \u201cA lot like in the mold of D.J., he is tough to bring down. ... We have a couple of young guys who can be explosive.\u201d\n\nMoore played 53 snaps and chipped in with a 32-yard run and a 16-yard reception vs. the Bucs, one week after posting a career-best 129 yards from scrimmage in a 36-21 win over Baltimore.\n\nSamuel is finally healthy after missing the first three games of this season with a heart issue and most of last season with a broken ankle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing after what happened last year,\u201d Samuel said of his production. \u201cTo go down unexpectedly and to fight through the offseason and preparing myself to get back from my ankle injury, and to come back and finally be out there to make plays and contribute to the team, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nTight end Greg Olsen, who has been with the team since 2011, said the Panthers have never had this many offensive players that can tear off big gains with the ball in their hands. He said Samuel and Moore are making a difference.\n\nBut Rivera is quick to point out the duo hasn\u2019t arrived just yet. They\u2019re still making too many \u201cmental errors\u201d for his liking.\n\n\u201cYou see some of the mistakes they make on tape and you see certain things in terms of their route running, their alignments and their assignments,\u201d Rivera said.\n\nNewton joked it may be time to bring a \u201cpaddle\u201d into the huddle with Moore\u2019s name (Deniston) on one side and Samuel\u2019s nickname (Cupid) on the other to \u201ckeep them focused.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t focus, they\u2019ll let an opportunity like we had slip away,\u201d Newton said. \u201cThey have to understand where their alignment is, what their assignment is. We ask a lot from those guys and for them to be so young and dynamic they have to be able to digest the things that we\u2019re throwing at them.\u201d\n\nRivera would like them to eliminate those mistakes before Carolina\u2019s crucial final three-game stretch of the season, which includes two games against the NFC South leading Saints (7-1).\n\n\u201cThey are learning and growing and their ceiling is high, so the potential for them to be better is exciting,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cHopefully we can continue to watch them grow in the next few weeks \u2014 and grow quickly.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "FORT MYERS, Fla.

A loss by the Eagles \u2014 as long as Clemson defeats Duke on Nov. 17 \u2014 would send the Tigers back to the ACC championship game.\n\nEagles coach Steve Addazio is also fully focused on Clemson and wants to make it a raucous atmosphere on campus come Saturday night.\n\n\u201cI hope our fan base is as energized as our team right now,\u201d Addazio said. \u201cWe\u2019re very grateful and fortunate that we\u2019re in a position to make it a big-time game.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections will mark the first nationwide voting since Russia targeted state election systems in the 2016 presidential race, with federal, state and local officials seeking to reassure the public their voting systems are secure.\n\nThere have been no signs so far that Russia or any other foreign actor has tried to launch cyberattacks against voting systems in any state, according to federal authorities.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has been working over the last year to improve communication and intelligence-sharing with state and local election officials who were largely left in the dark about Russian activities in 2016. Federal agencies including Homeland Security and the FBI have opened a command center to help state or local election offices with any major cybersecurity problems that arise.\n\n\u201cThings are running pretty smoothly around the country,\u201d said Matt Masterson, senior cybersecurity adviser with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe same can\u2019t be said for all security preparations, or for early voting and the voter registration process in some states.\n\nDHS officials have boasted that the 2018 midterms will be the most secure election in U.S. history, pointing to federal intrusion-detection sensors that will protect \u201c90 percent of election infrastructure,\u201d as DHS Undersecretary Christopher Krebs tweeted in mid-October. Those sensors sniff for malicious traffic, and are installed on election systems in 45 states.\n\nBut similar sensors used at the federal level have performed quite badly. According to a Sept. 14 letter from the Office of Management and Budget, those sensors had a 99 percent failure rate from April 2017 onward, when they detected only 379 out of almost 40,000 \u201cincidents\u201d across federal civilian networks.\n\nVoters casting ballots early have encountered faulty machines in Texas and North Carolina, inaccurate mailers in Missouri and Montana, and voter registration problems in Tennessee and Georgia. In other states, including Kansas, Election Day polling places have been closed or consolidated.\n\nSome of the problems have prompted lawsuits, and there is concern that last-minute court rulings on voter ID requirements in a handful of states will sow confusion among voters and poll workers.\n\nThe challenges come amid a surge of interest, with registrations and turnout running well ahead of what is typically seen during a midterm election.\n\nWendy Weiser, who oversees the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU, said she believes efforts to restrict voting access have been \u201cmore intense\u201d than in previous elections but said efforts to combat them also have increased dramatically.\n\n\u201cThese hurdles often work because people aren\u2019t willing to go to the trouble of going through the various hoops that the state puts in front of them,\u201d Weiser said. \u201cReally motivated voters can overcome these kinds of hurdles.\u201d\n\nThe issue of election security is clearly on the minds of voters. A recent Chicago Harris/AP-NORC poll found that nearly eight in 10 Americans are at least somewhat concerned about potential hacking of election systems, with 45 percent saying they are extremely or very concerned.\n\nA key concern is that five states exclusively use electronic voting machines that do not produce a paper trail that can be used to verify election results if questions about the final tally arise.\n\nGeorgia, where the governor\u2019s race is among the most closely watched elections in the country, is one of the states where voting rights groups have been raising numerous concerns about election security and voter access.\n\nOver the weekend, reports of security vulnerabilities within the state\u2019s online voter registration portal prompted a flurry of accusations from the Secretary of State\u2019s office, which is overseen by Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp. His office claimed without providing evidence that Democrats had tried to hack into the system. Democrats dismissed that as an effort to distract voters from a problem in a system he oversees.\n\nKemp is one of two Republicans who are overseeing elections this year while also running for governor. Former President Jimmy Carter is among those who have called for him to step down, but Kemp has insisted that he will continue to do the job while warning of the potential for voter fraud.\n\nWhile experts have said voter fraud is exceedingly rare, Republicans have used it to justify strict voter ID laws, purging of voter rolls and other measures that make it more difficult to vote.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has often cited voter fraud as a reason he lost the popular vote two years ago and has raised the issue during his recent campaigning. On Monday, he was asked what proof he had of people attempting to vote illegally in the midterms.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do you is go around, take a look at what\u2019s happened over the years and you\u2019ll see,\u201d he said outside Air Force One on his way to a rally. \u201cThere are a lot of people, a lot of people, my opinion and based on proof, that try and get in illegally and actually vote illegally.\u201d\n\nNationally, some 6,500 poll watchers are being deployed by a coalition of civil rights and voting advocacy groups, including Common Cause, to assist people who encounter problems at the polls. That is more than double the number sent to polling places in 2016, while the number of federal election monitors has declined.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department announced Monday that it is sending personnel to 35 jurisdictions in 19 states, which is less than the 67 jurisdictions in 28 states that received assistance in 2016.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.\n\n___\n\nFollow Christina Almeida Cassidy at http://twitter.com/AP_Christina and Colleen Long at http://twitter.com/ctlong1", "New Orleans resident Molly Ezell holds a sign promoting a Louisiana constitutional amendment that would require unanimous 12-member jury verdicts in serious felony cases in the state on Oct. 29, 2018 in New Orleans.

Among nine candidates vying for the job, several Republicans have spent the final days targeting their opponents in a race that has found difficulty drawing voters\u2019 interest or donors\u2019 money to mount major advertising efforts.\n\nInterim Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, Schedler\u2019s top aide, accused Rep. Rick Edmonds of shady campaign tactics. On Facebook, Ardoin said Edmonds has \u201cshown zero integrity\u201d and consistently misled voters \u201cabout my positions, my words and my character.\u201d\n\nEdmonds has slammed Ardoin through much of the race, saying Ardoin mishandled work to replace the state\u2019s voting machines. He\u2019s suggested Ardoin was disingenuous for entering the race at all after repeatedly saying he didn\u2019t intend to run.\n\nFormer Sen. A.G.

Jeff Flake, decide whether GOP Gov. Doug Ducey gets a second term in office and if the state\u2019s private school voucher program should be expanded.\n\nNearly 1.5 million early ballots had been received by county elections officials as of Friday. That\u2019s about 40 percent of the state\u2019s registered voters. Total turnout is estimated to top 56 percent, an unusually high number for a midterm election. Only 36 percent of registered voters cast ballots in 2014.\n\nPolls open at 6 a.m. Tuesday and close at 7 p.m.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the top races:\n\n___\n\nTIGHT SENATE RACE\n\nThe race to replace Flake has been a knock-down, drag-out fight between Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Martha McSally that could go either way.\n\nThe contest between the two sitting congresswomen is considered one of the nation\u2019s most competitive, with more than $90 million in spending by candidates and outside groups.\n\nSinema paints herself as an \u201cindependent\u201d centrist who can work across the aisle and has backed President Donald Trump\u2019s initiatives more than 60 percent of the time. The three-term congresswoman currently represents parts of Phoenix and Tempe.\n\nMcSally has focused on border security and boosting the nation\u2019s military while attacking Sinema as too radical for Arizona. She is a former Air Force pilot who has served two terms representing a Tucson-area congressional district and has run as a strong Trump backer after being criticized during the primary for not being supportive enough of the president.\n\n___\n\nGOVERNOR\n\nDucey appears well-positioned to win a second term despite a teacher strike that shut down public schools across the state earlier this year. The Republican has vastly outspent Democratic challenger David Garcia, an Arizona State University education professor. Polls show Ducey with a healthy lead.\n\nThe teachers returned to class after Ducey signed a plan for teacher pay raises that will reach 20 percent by 2020, including 1 percent granted in a previous budget.\n\nGarcia backed the strike that shut down public schools for nearly a week in May amid demands for higher teacher pay and more public education funding.\n\nGarcia refused to accept lobbyist or corporate contributions and his campaign was outspent by Ducey many times over, including millions of dollars in ads by the Republican Governors Association attempting to show Garcia as weak on border security.\n\n___\n\nU.S. HOUSE\n\nArizona Democrats hope to pick up a seat in the state\u2019s nine-member congressional delegation by winning the Tucson-area 2nd District now held by Republican Martha McSally. She won the seat in 2014 by a narrow margin and broadened her victory in 2016. The district had previously been held by Democrats.\n\nFormer Rep. Gabby Giffords held the seat until she resigned after an assassination attempt in Tucson in 2011 and was replaced by Democrat Ron Barber in 2011. He won a full term in 2012 but narrowly lost to McSally in 2014.\n\nThis year\u2019s 2nd District races features Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick and Republican Lea Marquez Peterson.\n\nThe 1st and 9th Districts are also seen as competitive and currently held by Democrats. Incumbent Tom O\u2019Halleran is being challenged by retired Air Force officer Wendy Rogers to represent the 1st District, while former Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton holed to replace Sinema and represent the 9th District. He faces Dr. Steve Ferrera, a physician.\n\nThere is a rematch between Republican Rep. Debbie Lesko and Democrat Hiral Tipirneni in the 8th District in the north and west Phoenix suburbs. Lesko beat Tipirneni by less than 5 percentage points in an April special election to replace former Republican Rep. Trent Franks.\n\n___\n\nSCHOOL VOUCHERS\n\nVoters are being asked to accept or reject a massive expansion of the state\u2019s private school voucher program that was adopted by the GOP-controlled Legislature and Republican Gov. Doug Ducey last year.\n\nThe measure, known as Proposition 305, is on the ballot because a grassroots group of educators objected and used a provision in the state constitution to put it on hold by collecting signatures. A yes vote allows the expansion, while a no vote rejects it.\n\nOpponents of Empowerment Scholarship Accounts say they mainly benefit wealthy Arizonans who will send their children to private school anyway while siphoning cash from public schools.\n\nBackers say they help parents from all income levels and give families a choice in where to send their children to school.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "ALBION, Ind.

French Hill and Democratic challenger Clarke Tucker campaigned across central Arkansas Monday ahead of a midterm election where Democrats remained hopeful for an upset in the solidly red state.\n\nThe race between Hill and Tucker for Arkansas\u2019 2nd Congressional District has drawn heavy attention ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm election in the state. The secretary of state\u2019s office hasn\u2019t predicted how many of the state\u2019s nearly 1.8 million registered voters will cast a ballot, but more than 412,000 had voted early or absentee by Monday.\n\nTucker, a state legislator who has talked often about his battle with bladder cancer, said health care remained the predominant issue as he hoped to flip the district covering Little Rock and seven central Arkansas counties. President Donald Trump won Arkansas by about 27 percentage points two years ago, and the state hasn\u2019t sent a Democrat to the U.S. House in eight years.\n\n\u201cI think the campaign we have run has broken through,\u201d Tucker said before campaigning at a diner in Bryant, located 15 miles southwest of Little Rock. \u201cEverywhere I go, I have people come up to me, and some people say, \u2018Thank you for not just giving me something to vote against, but something to vote for.\u2019\u201d\n\nHill, who was first elected to the seat in 2014, said he remained optimistic about the race and was pointed to gains in the economy. The Republican lawmaker won re-election by more than 20 percentage points two years ago.\n\n\u201cMy closing argument to the voters of the 2nd District is America is better off than it was two years ago and we\u2019ve gotten progress made on a number of fronts...but we still have two major issues we have to work on in the next Congress, and that\u2019s fixing the broken immigration system and the broken health care system,\u201d Hill said after greeting motorists during the morning rush hour in Little Rock.\n\nArkansas\u2019 election also features a hotly contested race for a state Supreme Court seat that has drawn heavy spending from a Washington-based conservative group. Justice Courtney Goodson faces a challenge from David Sterling, an attorney from the state Department of Human Services, for the non-partisan seat. Goodson last week lost a bid to block TV ads and mailers from the Republican State Leadership Committee, which has spent more than $1.2 million this fall on the high court race. Goodson lost her bid for chief justice two years ago after facing a similar barrage of outside spending.\n\nRepublican Gov. Asa Hutchinson was in a strong position as he faced a challenge from Democrat Jared Henderson, a former Teach for America official. Republicans were also favored in the other three U.S. House races and the state\u2019s other partisan statewide offices.\n\nArkansas\u2019 ballot also features proposals to legalize casinos in four counties, raise the state\u2019s minimum wage to $11 an hour by 2021 and further enshrine in the state\u2019s constitution a voter ID requirement.

The state appealed, and a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Monday heard arguments in the appeal.\n\nThe Associated Press, The Montgomery Advertiser and the Alabama Media Group had asked the court in March to unseal records in a lawsuit brought by death row inmate Doyle Lee Hamm. Alabama prison officials in February halted Hamm\u2019s scheduled execution at the last minute when the lethal injection team was unable to connect an intravenous line to his veins.\n\nAlabama has for years refused to release the details of its execution process and where it gets the drugs used in lethal injections.\n\nThe public has a great interest in understanding how Alabama carries out executions and the unsealing of the documents would likely \u201cpromote understanding of a historically significant event,\u201d Bowdre wrote in a 19-page memorandum ordering the release of the records. She wrote that the state could keep secret some information, like the names of low-level prison employees involved in executions.\n\nHamm\u2019s attorneys had sued to block his execution, saying his veins were so damaged by lymphoma, hepatitis and past drug use that it would be extremely difficult to execute him. As part of that litigation, the state provided Hamm\u2019s attorneys with a redacted copy of the execution protocol after securing a protective order from the judge to keep it confidential.\n\nStephen Frisby, a lawyer for the state argued in court that while the execution protocol was provided to Hamm\u2019s attorneys and the judge, it was never attached to a filing in the case and therefore shouldn\u2019t be considered a judicial record that is subject to release.\n\nBowdre had concluded in her order that it was a judicial record because she \u201cneeded and relied upon\u201d that document to decide Hamm\u2019s case.

The state appealed, and a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Monday heard arguments in the appeal.\n\nThe Associated Press, The Montgomery Advertiser and the Alabama Media Group had asked the court in March to unseal records in a lawsuit brought by death row inmate Doyle Lee Hamm. Alabama prison officials in February halted Hamm\u2019s scheduled execution at the last minute when the lethal injection team was unable to connect an intravenous line to his veins.\n\nAlabama has for years refused to release the details of its execution process and where it gets the drugs used in lethal injections.\n\nThe public has a great interest in understanding how Alabama carries out executions and the unsealing of the documents would likely \u201cpromote understanding of a historically significant event,\u201d Bowdre wrote in a 19-page memorandum ordering the release of the records. She wrote that the state could keep secret some information, like the names of low-level prison employees involved in executions.\n\nHamm\u2019s attorneys had sued to block his execution, saying his veins were so damaged by lymphoma, hepatitis and past drug use that it would be extremely difficult to execute him. As part of that litigation, the state provided Hamm\u2019s attorneys with a redacted copy of the execution protocol after securing a protective order from the judge to keep it confidential.\n\nStephen Frisby, a lawyer for the state argued in court that while the execution protocol was provided to Hamm\u2019s attorneys and the judge, it was never attached to a filing in the case and therefore shouldn\u2019t be considered a judicial record that is subject to release.\n\nBowdre had concluded in her order that it was a judicial record because she \u201cneeded and relied upon\u201d that document to decide Hamm\u2019s case.

(AP) \u2014 In a jubilant locker room deep within Arrowhead Stadium, a young man impeccably dressed who looked as if he\u2019d stepped out of a college classroom greeted Chiefs wide receiver Sammy Watkins with a brilliant smile and an enthusiastic high-five.\n\nWatkins had just had another standout performance in another Chiefs win, and Brett Veach no doubt felt a bit of satisfaction that his much-panned free-agent acquisition was paying such dividends.\n\nThen again, just about everything the Chiefs general manager does these days turns out all right.\n\nHis draft picks are thriving. His free-agent pickups have worked out brilliantly. And his myriad moves to cultivate depth and competition throughout the roster have allowed the Chiefs to not only deal with significant injuries but also race to an 8-1 start and take a stranglehold on the AFC West.\n\n\u201cBrett is very, very thorough and always prepared for whatever the scenario is, whether it\u2019s the draft or free agency or just working the roster on a week-to-week basis,\u201d Chiefs owner Clark Hunt said recently. \u201cHe and Andy (Reid) work well together and that\u2019s an important part of the equation.\u201d\n\nIndeed, when Reid was hired as the Chiefs coach it was with the understanding that he would no longer handle the GM duties that bogged him down in Philadelphia. So, Hunt hired John Dorsey away from the Packers front office, and one of his top lieutenants was one of Reid\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s from Philly.\n\nVeach had joined him there when he was not yet 30, the former Delaware standout taking an entry level job on Reid\u2019s staff. But he quickly impressed everyone in the organization with his detail, work ethic and acumen, and he rose through the ranks before joining the front office in Kansas City.\n\nWhen the decision came last summer to part with Dorsey, Veach was a somewhat unexpected choice.\n\nBut despite taking the reins on the eve of training camp, he nevertheless put his fingerprints on a roster that would win the division title. He traded for former first-round draft pick Cam Ervin, who now starts on the offensive line, and for Reggie Ragland, who now starts at linebacker.\n\nHe made a series of moves deeper down the depth chart, too, seemingly never taking a break.\n\nVeach continued to make aggressive roster moves after the season, dealing away quarterback Alex Smith for cornerback Kendall Fuller and a draft pick and turning the job over to Patrick Mahomes.\n\nThe moves have paid off in every way possible: Mahomes is off to a record-setting start to his career, the Chiefs created some much-needed salary cap space, Fuller has been their best cornerback and the third-round pick they acquired has turned into more help for their rebuilt defense.\n\nYes, even Veach\u2019s draft picks have paid off.\n\nHe was without a first-round selection in April because of the trade to select Mahomes last year, but he nevertheless moved adroitly around the draft board to acquire players he liked.\n\nSecond-round pick Breeland Speaks has started at outside linebacker with Justin Houston hurt, and defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi and linebacker Dorian O\u2019Daniel have been regulars as third-round picks. Safety Armani Watts was pushing for a starting job before landing on injured reserve earlier this year and sixth-round pick Tremon Smith has been a special teams standout.\n\n\u201cGoing back to last year,\u201d Hunt said, \u201cI was impressed with the short amount of time that he had to make some changes going into the 2017 season that ultimately really had an impact. That wasn\u2019t something I was expecting. And Brett\u2019s now had a full offseason, a draft and free agency, and he\u2019s made a lot of moves, and I think we\u2019re seeing the fruit of his labor this year.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the moves Veach has made, either. He\u2019s also shown patience to stand pat when nothing suits his liking, such as he did when the trade deadline passed without a peep.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to do something just to do it to appease. He\u2019s going to do what\u2019s best for the Chiefs and he\u2019s really good about that,\u201d Reid said. \u201cThat\u2019s just where he\u2019s at.\u201d\n\nSo far his best has been nearly perfect.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "1 of 2 Kansas coach Bill Self talks with guard K.J.

(AP) \u2014 Coach Bill Self isn\u2019t sure what to be expect when top-ranked Kansas steps on the floor for its first regular-season game of the season against No. 10 Michigan State on Tuesday night in the Champions Classic.\n\nThe Jayhawks were sloppy in a pair of easy exhibition wins. They have a new-look roster featuring a series of Division I transfers and high-profile recruits. And they\u2019re facing a team in the Spartans that will be a major upgrade over Division II schools Emporia State and Washburn.\n\nOne thing is certain: Self will be glad the focus on the Jayhawks is back on the court.\n\nRather than in the courts.\n\nHis program has been dragged through the mud the past six weeks as three officials linked to shoe company Adidas were convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud for their roles in funneling money from the company to the families of recruits at Kansas, Louisville and its other partner schools. Power forward Silvio de Sousa, whose family was mentioned in the court documents and testimony, will be held out against the Spartans and for the foreseeable future as his eligibility is investigated.\n\nSelf and his staff have not been accused of any wrongdoing, nor has the school, which has maintained throughout the FBI investigation into college basketball corruption that it was merely a victim. But it nevertheless has cast a shadow over the school that has been difficult to shake.\n\nMaybe the bright lights of the Champions Classic will finally do it. The Jayhawks and Spartans open the season\u2019s traditional lid-lifting doubleheader in Indianapolis, while second-ranked Duke takes on fourth-ranked Kentucky in Tuesday\u2019s nightcap.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve studied them a little bit,\u201d Self said of the Spartans. \u201cIt\u2019s totally different personnel on both sides. They always seem to play well against us. We\u2019ll have to play a lot better than what we have played. Hopefully we\u2019ll also raise our level that maybe we haven\u2019t seen yet, too, going there.\u201d\n\nThe Jayhawks may have a new-look lineup but they do have plenty of Division I experience.\n\nTheir leading scorer and rebounder during their exhibition wins was Dedric Lawson, a forward who transferred from Memphis along with his brother, K.J. Lawson. And one of their steadiest ball-handlers in their two games at Allen Fieldhouse was Charlie Moore, a transfer from California.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited to play against a top-10 team early in the season,\u201d Dedric Lawson said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good time for us to see where we really stand collectively.\u201d\n\nFive-star prospects Quentin Grimes, Devon Dotson and David McCormack will also factor into whether the Jayhawks can make another Final Four run, but all of them will have to go through some growing pains.\n\nThat much was evident during the exhibition games.\n\n\u201cMoving it up to a Tuesday to start the season and having a game of this magnitude this early, I\u2019m not sure it will be the best played, especially if you\u2019re playing with young kids,\u201d Self said. \u201cWe are, and they have some young kids as well.\u201d\n\nThe Jayhawks do have some holdovers from last year, though, and they will no doubt rely on bruising big man Udoka Azubuike and springy guard Lagerald Vick against the Spartans.\n\n\u201cOur team is ready,\u201d Azubuike said. \u201cWe just have to tighten up a lot of stuff. Overall I think we are ready as far as talent, and I know they will be ready too, so we have to attack.\u201d\n\nSelf has done an admirable job insulating his players from the off-the-court issues that could have become a distraction. But that task will almost certainly become easier once the ball is finally thrown up on Tuesday night and the regular season gets under way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of the season. The fans are excited, everyone wants to see what Kansas can do,\u201d Azubuike said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first big, official game that we play in. I think the way we go into that game really helps us moving forward. The stage of the Champions Classic is close to the same stage as the Final Four. I told the younger guys we can\u2019t think too much. We just have to play our game.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "Police investigators work the scene of a shooting, Friday, Nov. 2, 2018, in Tallahassee, Fla.

(Tori Schneider/Tallahassee Democrat via AP)\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The man who shot and killed two women at a yoga studio was fired from his job as a substitute teacher for inappropriately touching a middle school girl, a Florida school district said.\n\nPaul Scott Beierle, 40, posed as a customer during a yoga class Friday, then began shooting, authorities said. A 61-year-old faculty member at Florida State University and a 21-year-old FSU student from Georgia were killed. Five others were injured. Beierle then killed himself.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why Beierle chose that yoga studio in the Florida capital. He had lived in Tallahassee from 2011-2013 but had recently been living several hours away. Police have not released information on a motive.\n\nBut what\u2019s clear is that Beierle had a history of harassing women and acting inappropriately. From pinching women\u2019s buttocks to tickling a middle school student to appearing to make misogynistic videos, there were several red flags surrounding his behavior.\n\nKelly Schulz, a spokeswoman for the Volusia County School District, said Monday that Beierle was fired in May after he asked a female student if she was ticklish and then touched her at the top of the stomach \u201cbelow the bra line,\u201d a district report says.\n\n\u201cStudent was frightened and hid behind another student,\u201d the report said.\n\nSchool personnel records show that students and a parent complained about Beierle\u2019s conduct at a different school prior to the May incident.\n\nNicole Gillespie said her twin eighth-grade daughters told her on the first day of school in August of 2017 that Beierle, who was teaching language arts, was \u201ccreepy.\u201d\n\nShe encouraged her daughters to give him a chance, but they insisted his behavior of calling only girls to the front of the room was inappropriate.\n\n\u201cMom, he\u2019s staring at us,\u201d they told her.\n\nWhen Gillespie looked him up on the internet, she found pictures of burlesque dancers, inappropriate sexual discussions and photos of him with weapons on his Facebook page. Her daughters told school authorities of their discomfort, and he was moved to a different school.\n\nSchulz said Beierle was hired in 2017 after he passed a federal and state criminal background check both with Volusia County Schools and the Department of Education. He was issued a teaching certification by DOE in July 2015, she said.\n\nBeierle was a military veteran with degrees from Binghamton University and Florida State University. Raised in Vestal, New York, he appeared to have made videos detailing his hatred of everything from the Affordable Care Act to girls who\u2019d allegedly mistreated him in middle school. The videos were posted four years ago, and were removed from YouTube after the shooting.\n\nBeierle, who had moved to the central Florida town of Deltona after getting a graduate degree from FSU, appeared to post a series of videos in 2014 where he called women \u201cwhores\u201d if they dated black men, said many black women were \u201cdisgusting\u201d and described himself as a misogynist.\n\nA Tallahassee police spokesman wouldn\u2019t confirm or deny the videos were Beierle\u2019s. However, the man speaking in the videos looks like him, and biographical details mentioned in the videos match known facts about Beierle.\n\nIn 2012, he was arrested twice for grabbing women on FSU\u2019s campus. Charges were dropped.\n\nFour years later, Beierle was arrested for misdemeanor battery after a woman said he approached her at the swimming pool of a Tallahassee apartment complex, complemented her rear end and offered to rub sunscreen on it, records show. The woman said she declined the offer and Beierle then slapped her on the buttocks and grabbed her.\n\nCourt records indicate prosecutors agreed to dismiss the battery charge after Beierle completed a six-month diversion agreement requiring him to stay out of trouble, not drink alcohol to excess and to follow a psychologist\u2019s recommendations.", "Former President Barack Obama smiles as he greets Democratic volunteers in a surprise appearance in Fairfax Station, Va., on Monday, Nov. 5, 2018.

And small business owners may wonder how they can prepare their companies to deal with a possible attack. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 News of another mass shooting, including the recent attack on a synagogue in Pittsburgh, makes many people wonder what they would do if confronted with an active shooter or other assailant. And small business owners may wonder how they can prepare their companies to deal with a possible attack.\n\nHere are some questions and answers:\n\nQ. What resources are available to help small business owners prepare their staffers to deal with potential violence?\n\nA. There are websites and videos online that describe what employees should do if there is an active shooter. Government agencies have web pages with instructions and videos, among them the Department of Homeland Security (www.dhs.gov ), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (www.fema.gov ) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (www.osha.gov ). Another site is www.ready.gov , also operated by Homeland Security.\n\nBut sending employees an email with a list of online resources may not help prepare people, says Sean Ahrens, a security consultant with AEI Affiliated Engineers. In-person training sessions that include role-playing and tours of a company\u2019s facilities to point out exit routes and potential hiding places are more likely to have a lasting impact, he says.\n\n\u201cWhen you put someone into that role-playing, the adrenaline gets going,\u201d Ahrens says.\n\nOwners may want to consider bringing in security consultants to train staffers. And many local law enforcement agencies are willing to analyze small businesses and help owners and employees understand where and how they can escape or hide. For example: If they hide inside a room with furniture, they should block the door with pieces of furniture piled on top of one another, creating as big a barricade as possible.\n\nQ. What\u2019s involved in preparing to deal with an active shooter?\n\nA. There is no way to prepare for the exact circumstances of an attack because each situation is unique and unpredictable. But a company can create a plan that helps people know generally what to do, says Rob Shuster, a vice president at the security consultancy AFIMAC Global.\n\nFor example, everyone should know how to report that there\u2019s an assailant on the premises, and they need to know how the company will communicate with everyone on the premises. They should know that they need to run from the building if possible, where all the exits are and where they should assemble. They need to know all the possible hiding places, and how to secure the doors of rooms and closets. They need to know quirks in the building that can save their lives \u2014 like a crawl space that a shooter or other assailant doesn\u2019t know about.\n\nA plan can also help people know what common mistakes to avoid, Shuster says. For example, escaping employees may want to run up to a law enforcement officer, a dangerous idea because officers may not know whether the people approaching them are innocent or assailants, he says. And, their hands should be empty, so no one mistakenly believes they\u2019re carrying a weapon.\n\nQ. Are there potential incidents besides a random active shooter that companies should prepare for?\n\nA. Security experts also train owners and workers about what to do in the case of disgruntled staffer or a domestic dispute \u2014 two situations that are more likely to happen at a workplace. They also instruct companies about how to deal with a robbery or other criminal act.\n\nIn the cases of a vengeful staffer or a domestic dispute, employees would take some of the same steps, starting with running and hiding, as with a random shooter. In the case of a robbery, the safest approach is to give criminals what they\u2019re looking for, says Brent O\u2019Bryan, a vice president at Allied Universal, a company that provides security and other services. While there have been videos on TV and online of some store employees tackling robbers, that is not recommended, and could be deadly, he says.\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to know in advance that a current or former staffer will come into a workplace and begin attacking employees and managers. But owners can lessen the possibility of an attack by addressing problems as they come up, O\u2019Bryan says. An owner should consider asking human resources professionals for advice in dealing with angry or troubled staffers.\n\n\u201cA business owner needs to make sure he or she as leaders are willing to step in and stop issues \u2014 whether it\u2019s an employee acting up for a problem between employees \u2014 and snuff it out so it cannot evolve into something worse,\u201d O\u2019Bryan says.\n\nViolence related to a domestic dispute is equally hard to predict. But owners also need to encourage staffers to speak up if they are having domestic issues or have obtained an order of protection against a spouse, partner or boyfriend or girlfriend, O\u2019Bryan says.\n\nCo-workers also need to feel free to approach the boss if there seems to be a problem, such as a troubled or angry staffer, or an employee suffering through a difficult and possibly threatening domestic situation.\n\n_____\n\nFor more small business news, insights and inspiration, sign up for our free weekly newsletter here: http://discover.ap.org/ssb\n\n_____\n\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

The secretary of state\u2019s office says 19.7 million people are registered to vote.\n\nDemocrats have chased Republicans from many California offices and are poised to hold that ground and perhaps gain more.\n\nDemocratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is the strong favorite over Republican businessman John Cox to succeed Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown. For the second consecutive general election, there isn\u2019t even a Republican on the ballot for U.S. Senate. This time, Sen. Dianne Feinstein has coasted against Democratic state Sen. Kevin de Leon.\n\nIn the Legislature, the question isn\u2019t whether Democrats will control the Assembly and Senate again \u2014 no one doubts that. It\u2019s whether Democrats get a veto-proof supermajority in the state Senate to add to their supermajority in the Assembly.\n\nThe status would allow them to raise taxes, suspend legislative rules and override vetoes without needing GOP votes.\n\nRepublicans hold just 14 congressional seats statewide, but seven of those districts were carried by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election and are battlegrounds this time around. Democrats don\u2019t appear in danger in any of the 39 districts they hold.\n\nThe trajectory of the election appears headed toward \u201cthe era of being a one-party state and the interesting internal conflicts that come with that,\u201d University of California, San Diego political scientist Thad Kousser said Monday.\n\nHe pointed out that the drama in the governor\u2019s race this year was during the primary between Newsom and fellow Democrat Antonio Villaraigosa, with Cox seen as a longshot from the start.\n\n\u201cWhat happens when you have one-party states? What you see is these fights within parties,\u201d Kousser said.\n\nIn San Francisco, Feinstein dropped off her ballot at City Hall, where the 85-year-old Democrat urged residents to vote.\n\n\u201cOf course, I hope more Democrats vote than Republicans, but in any event, everyone should vote,\u201d she said.\n\nDemocrats hold a 3.7 million edge in voter registrations, and Republicans are also outnumbered by independents, who in California tend to vote like Democrats.\n\nOf 1.4 million new registrations this year, only 187,000 signed up as Republicans, or roughly 14 percent, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan research firm Political Data Inc. The largest group of new voters signed up as independents.\n\nJust a generation ago, California was a reliably Republican state in presidential contests. But a surge in immigrants transformed the state and its voting patterns. The number of Hispanics, blacks and Asians combined has outnumbered whites in the state since 1998.\n\nNew voters, largely Latinos and Asians, lean Democratic.\n\nSteve Poizner\u2019s candidacy sums up the state of the California GOP. He was a Republican but decided to run as an independent to regain his old job as insurance commissioner. If he wins, he\u2019ll be the first independent elected to statewide office.\n\nPresident Donald Trump endorsed Cox, helping elevate him to second place in the June primary and a slot on the November ballot in the state that Trump lost to Clinton by over 4 million votes in 2016.\n\nThe president has kept up a steady campaign schedule in Republican-friendly states, but his absence in California this fall suggests he would do more harm than good for GOP candidates in tight races.\n\nFor months, Trump has been a leading character in Democratic ads that seek to link Republican candidates to his agenda.\n\nThat\u2019s especially the case in the seven U.S. House contests where Democrats are trying to flip seats as they seek to win 23 districts nationwide and regain control of the House.\n\nFour of those seven California battlegrounds are in Orange County, once considered Republican heartland but where much has changed due to demographic shifts over the past two decades. Clinton was the first Democrat to win the county since the Depression era.\n\nAmong the Republicans looking to hold off tough challenges are Reps. Dana Rohrabacher and Mimi Walters, both closely tied to Trump. Rohrabacher is being challenged by Harley Rouda, a Republican-turned-Democrat businessman, while Walters faces law professor Katie Porter.\n\nAt a Democratic rally Saturday in Irvine, Assembly candidate Cottie Petrie-Norris summed up the party\u2019s optimism: \u201cWe have changed the face of Orange County,\u201d she said.\n\nAmong other prominent issues on the ballot, Californians are considering whether to repeal increased gas taxes and vehicle fees that Brown and the Legislature approved last year to fund transportation projects.\n\nBrown, apparently headed for retirement after a lifetime in politics, made a rare campaign appearance last week to oppose Proposition 6. He called the proposal \u201ca scheme and a scam.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have pushed the repeal as a way to motivate voters. They say the tax hikes are another burden on working families in a state that has some of the nation\u2019s highest taxes.\n\nOther ballot issues generating attention would cap profits for dialysis clinics, expand rent control and require more space for farm animals.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Janie Har in San Francisco contributed.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "BRIDGEPORT, Conn.

(Nathan Papes /The Springfield News-Leader via AP, File)\n\nBRANSON, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Records show a water pump had been replaced with a less powerful system in a tourist duck boat that sank in a Missouri lake, killing 17 people.\n\nThe Kansas City Star reports that the original Higgins pump, which is capable of removing as much as 250 gallons of water per minute from the bottom of a boat, was replaced with two less powerful electric pumps in the boat that sank in July at Table Rock Lake in the Branson area.\n\nThe capacity of those two pumps wasn\u2019t clear. But Coast Guard duck boat inspection records show that other Higgins pumps have been replaced in recent years in other ducks boats, with the new pumps capable of extracting a combined 20 gallons of water or less per minute. That\u2019s not even one-tenth the pumping capacity of a Higgins, which was one of two pumping systems aboard the original World War II era duck boats.\n\nOne pumping system was for normal operations as the boats transported troops and equipment from ship to shore, while the Higgins was to keep the boats afloat in difficult conditions such as wind speeds of more than 15 mph or wave height of more than 3 feet. After the war, as the boats were converted for tourism, the Higgins pump was sometimes removed from duck boats so the vessels could be lengthened, or \u201cstretched,\u201d to accommodate more passengers.\n\nIssues arose when the sunken boat, dubbed Stretch Duck 07, faced near hurricane force winds. Investigators haven\u2019t determined whether the less powerful pumps played a role, although a malfunctioning pump was blamed for contributing to the 1999 sinking of the Miss Majestic duck boat in Lake Hamilton in Arkansas in which 13 died.\n\nStretch Duck 07\u2032s owner, Ripley Entertainment, said through spokeswoman Suzanne Smagala-Potts that the company can\u2019t comment on the pump because \u201cthe investigation and related litigation are ongoing.\u201d\n\nRemoving the Higgins pump is permitted, as long as there are two smaller pumps on the vessels. But the removal has raised questions among experts and attorneys because of the potential of duck boats to sink rapidly. A lawsuit filed by Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley alleges that the company \u201cdid not conform to\u201d federal safety recommendations by failing to replace the Higgins with a pump of equal or greater capacity.\n\nMary Schiavo, former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation, said it makes no sense to remove the powerful bilge pump, but said duck boats are a \u201cloophole craft\u201d that doesn\u2019t fit neatly into any category because they are \u201cso old and have been modified so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing that struck me,\u201d Schiavo said of a video of the boat struggling in the water before it went down, \u201cwas it just kept getting lower and lower in the water as the water was coming over the sides. So I wondered if the bilge system was working, because if you\u2019re getting water over the sides of the boat and the bilges are working, you ought to be able to keep up.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) \u2014 More than 1.5 million adults in Florida are ineligible to vote because they have felony convictions. Voters rights\u2019 groups are hoping that will change on Tuesday.\n\nKnown as the voting rights restoration initiative, constitutional Amendment 4 would fundamentally alter the way convicted felons participate in democracy.\n\nIf it passes, those with felony convictions will be able have voting rights restored automatically if they\u2019ve completed their sentences, including parole and probation. It doesn\u2019t apply to anyone convicted of murder or sexual assault. Supporters of the amendment say the current process to apply for restoration of those rights is prohibitively difficult and arbitrary.\n\nThe ballot measure needs 60 percent of the vote to pass. At the beginning of 2018, Floridians for a Fair Democracy collected more than 799,000 certified petition signatures, or about 33,000 more than the group needed to get the measure on the ballot.\n\nMarc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, a Washington nonprofit that advocates sentencing reform, says Florida is \u201cground zero\u201d for disenfranchised felons.\n\nOf the 6.1 million disenfranchised felons in the U.S., about 1.7 million live in Florida \u2014 the most of any state, Mauer said. Only 12 states disenfranchise people for a felony conviction after they\u2019ve served their sentence, he said.\n\n\u201cThe numbers in Florida really dwarf any other state,\u201d Mauer said.\n\nThe Florida ballot proposal has been championed by celebrities \u2014 singer John Legend held a community event in Orlando in October to highlight the issue. And it\u2019s been the subject of several national news pieces.\n\nCurrently, felons in Florida can only regain voting ability if they apply to the state Office of Executive Clemency. The felon\u2019s case is heard by the governor and his Cabinet, and sometimes, the person seeking restoration will go before the board and explain their situation, and how they have repented or been rehabilitated. Florida\u2019s governor has a unilateral veto on the applications.\n\nShortly after taking office in 2007, then-Republican Gov. Charlie Crist persuaded two of the state\u2019s three Cabinet members to approve rules that would allow the parole commission to restore voting rights for nonviolent felons without a hearing. Within a year, more than 100,000 ex-felons were granted voting rights.\n\nBut Republican Gov. Rick Scott and the Cabinet ended automatic restoration of voting rights as one of Scott\u2019s first acts upon taking office in 2011.\n\nSiottis Jackson, 30, of Jacksonville, is director of the North Florida chapter of Second Chances, a nonprofit group supporting Amendment 4. He\u2019s been a political activist for years. In 2015, he was convicted of a felony fraud charge, meaning that he asks people to vote, but can\u2019t vote himself.\n\n\u201cI work for candidates and I can\u2019t vote for them,\u201d he said. \u201cI live in a community where a lot of people are affected by this.\u201d\n\nJackson said that when people lose their right to vote, \u201cthey begin to lose their hope and their engagement in our democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a streetlight out, they don\u2019t complain. They feel their voice isn\u2019t going to be heard. It reduces their interest in community pride. They say, \u2018I don\u2019t get involved, because I don\u2019t have the right to vote.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdding more than a million people to the state\u2019s voter rolls could have broad implications in a state where elections are often won by a razor-thin margin. In 2016, President Donald Trump won Florida with less than 50 percent of the vote, defeating Hillary Clinton 49 percent to 47.8 percent, or 112,911 votes.\n\nSeparately, Florida\u2019s process of restoring voting rights to felons is winding its way through an appeals court case. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker ruled the state\u2019s system is unconstitutional because it is arbitrary and open to having applications approved or rejected for political reasons. He ordered the state to revamp its system, but Scott\u2019s administration appealed. The appellate court put Walker\u2019s order on hold while it considers the case.\n\nA spokesman for Scott has said that judges should interpret the law, not create it, and that the governor will \u201cnever stop fighting for victims of crime and their families.\u201d", "CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 A man accused of shooting and injuring a Cleveland police officer with an assault-type rifle while the officer was responding to a call about a shooting has been charged with attempted murder.\n\nA $1 million bond was set Monday in Cleveland Municipal Court for Jonathan Chambers.

Hungry New Hampshire voters got a preview of their ballot choices along with the daily specials Monday as candidates hit multiple diners, restaurants, and coffee shops seeking last-minute support.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Steve Negron\u2019s schedule included all of the above as he made the case for unseating U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster, a Democrat seeking a fourth term in the 2nd Congressional District. While Kuster focused on rallying volunteers, Democrat Chris Pappas, running for the 1st District seat, and Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Molly Kelly both had diner stops planned before heading to college campuses. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, meanwhile, started his birthday waving signs with supporters, addressing a rotary club and visiting a construction company.\n\nPappas\u2019 opponent, Republican Eddie Edwards, campaigned with Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and current Trump administration attorney. Edwards, a former police chief and former state liquor commission official who emphasizes integrity and character, often bristled at questions about the president\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cWe continue to use the same divisive approaches in politics. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair to any of us,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cAt the end of the day, we need men and women of character. I think your character becomes more important than the office you\u2019re running for, or your policies for that matter.\u201d\n\nPappas, who was joined by former Gov. John Lynch at the family restaurant he runs in Manchester, also talks about restoring decency to Washington. A former state lawmaker and current Executive Councilor, he contrasts what he calls Edwards\u2019 \u201cdangerous\u201d views with his goal of investing in higher education, job training, environmental protection and affordable health care.\n\n\u201cI have a record of working across the aisle to get things done at the Statehouse,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cPeople who know me know that I am someone who is collaborative, works in a bipartisan way and puts people before politics. I think that\u2019s we need in Washington.\u201d\n\nPappas and Edwards are competing to replace Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, who held the seat for two terms starting in 2006 and then traded it back and forth with Republican Frank Guinta in the last four elections. Shea-Porter\u2019s departure means an end to the state\u2019s distinction of having the nation\u2019s only all-female, all Democratic Congressional delegation, but Kelly is hoping to return the governor\u2019s office to female control.\n\nKelly, a former state senator, is seeking to become the third woman elected governor of New Hampshire by following in the footsteps of fellow Democrats Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, both of whom are now in the U.S. Senate. Throughout the campaign, she highlighted her background as a former single mother who put herself through college, and said she understands the struggles of New Hampshire families because she lived them.\n\nDemocrats are hoping for a blue wave, though Sununu has history on his side. Only two governors in the last 100 years have sought re-election and lost after one term.\n\nSununu argues more significant legislation has passed during his tenure than under any other governor in the last two decades. He frequently touted the state\u2019s strong economy and low unemployment rate, and progress made on combatting the opioid crisis and reforming the state\u2019s mental health and child welfare systems.", "Donald Trump Jr., center, and former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, right, urge a crowd of supporters to vote for U.S. Rep.

(AP Photo/Adam Beam)\n\nMOUNT STERLING, Ky. (AP) \u2014 At risk of losing his seat in a district President Donald Trump won by double digits in 2016, Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr implored voters Monday to send him back to Washington because he has \u201caccess and influence with this administration.\u201d\n\nBut the retired Marine fighter pilot seeking to replace him said she was more interested having \u201cthe courage to check the president,\u201d saying her election would send a message \u201cabout who we are and the type of leaders we want in our country.\u201d\n\nAndy Barr\u2019s battle with Democrat Amy McGrath in one of the nation\u2019s most closely watched congressional races highlights a slate of important elections Tuesday in Kentucky, where Trump won by nearly 30 percentage points two years ago. Voters across the state will decide whether to amend Kentucky\u2019s Constitution to give rights to crime victims; choose which party will control the state House of Representatives heading into a contentious 2019 governor\u2019s race; and decide whether to re-elect a rural county clerk whose opposition to same-sex marriage landed her in jail in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses.\n\nBut the expensive race in Kentucky\u2019s 6th Congressional district has gotten the national attention. Both political parties believe it\u2019s one of a handful of key races that could determine control of Congress for the remainder of Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nMcGrath has raised nearly twice as much money as Barr, using it to build an impressive get-out-the vote operation with field offices in all 19 counties and hundreds of volunteers knocking on doors. Barr has run a more traditional campaign, focusing heavily on negative TV ads and large rallies featuring Trump and his allies. Monday, Barr campaigned with Donald Trump Jr. and former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle as they sought to jumpstart sluggish GOP voters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fat and happy. We\u2019ve gotten everything we wanted so far,\u201d Trump Jr. told the crowd. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot left to be done.\u201d\n\nBarr vowed to support President Trump\u2019s policies, including building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But he focused much of his speech on the country\u2019s improving economy, calling it the result of Republican efforts in Washington. That resonated with Dennis Heck, a 60-year-old retiree who said the investments he relies on have \u201cskyrocketed\u201d since Trump took office. If Democrats take control of Congress, he said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid it will slow down.\u201d\n\nAs threats of violence have disrupted campaigns this election and prompted calls for more civility, Barr also portrayed himself as a bipartisan deal maker who would support Democrat and Republican ideas \u201cas long as it\u2019s in the best interests of my constituents.\u201d\n\nBut his comments were overshadowed by the rallying cries of Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle, who urged voters to not let the \u201cliberal crazies\u201d take over. Guilfoyle told the crowd she has a \u201chit list\u201d that includes Democrats Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Chuck Schumer and Cory Booker. Waters and Booker\u2019s offices were targeted by pipe bombs sent in the mail.\n\nIn Lexington, McGrath spoke to a few dozen supporters who were preparing to knock on doors and ask people to vote for her. Kim Human, a 62-year-old self-employed business consultant, said she\u2019s voting for McGrath because \u201cI think that she brings a fresh perspective to a really bad political situation in our country.\u201d\n\nDemocrats hope McGrath\u2019s campaign, which has raised nearly $8 million, will boost Democratic candidates running for state legislative seats. Those candidates include at least 36 current or former teachers, most of them Democrats, who are upset with changes to the state pension system enacted by Republican Gov. Matt Bevin and the GOP-dominated legislature.\n\nIn Rowan County, voters will decide whether to re-elect County Clerk Kim Davis, who was jailed in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses after the U.S. Supreme Court effectively legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. She faces Democrat Elwood Caudill Jr., who has downplayed the controversy while promising to treat everyone equally if he is elected.\n\nAnd voters statewide will be asked to change Kentucky\u2019s Constitution to guarantee rights for crime victims. But the results of that election will be on hold, as a state judge has ruled the ballot question is too vague. The case won\u2019t be resolved until after the election. Votes will still count, but election officials won\u2019t certify the results until the case is finished.", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Pentagon says that a Russian fighter jet flew dangerously close to a U.S. military reconnaissance plane in international airspace over the Black Sea on Monday.\n\nPentagon spokesman Eric Pahon says the Russian SU-27 made a high-speed pass directly in front of the U.S. EP-3 and came \u201cvery, very close\u201d to the American aircraft.

(AP) \u2014 Which political party will control Congress for the final two years of President Donald Trump\u2019s term? A key congressional race in Kentucky will help answer that question. Kentucky\u2019s 6th District has shattered fundraising records and garnered appearances from Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. Kentucky Democrats hope attention from the race will boost dozens of state legislative candidates as they attempt to win back control of the state House of Representatives.\n\nHere are some of the key races on Nov. 6:\n\n6th CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT\n\nDemocrats have coveted Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr\u2019s central Kentucky-based House seat for years, but 2018 is their best chance to win. Democratic challenger Amy McGrath is a retired Marine fighter pilot who has raised more money than Barr. Democratic voters are highly motivated, but Republicans hope an early October visit from President Donald Trump motivated enough GOP voters to give Barr a fourth term.\n\nAlso on the ballot are independent candidates James Germalic and Rikka L. Wallin, along with Libertarian candidate Frank Harris.\n\n3rd CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT\n\nMost political observers see Kentucky\u2019s 3rd Congressional district in Louisville as a safe Democratic seat, with Rep. John Yarmuth as the state\u2019s lone voice of dissent among Kentucky\u2019s GOP-dominated delegation. But Vickie Yates Glisson surprised people in January when she resigned as secretary of the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services to challenge Yarmuth. Glisson has tried to make the race about health care, criticizing Yarmuth for supporting a single-payer system. Yarmuth has focused on fighting \u201cscandals\u201d in Washington and Frankfort, Kentucky\u2019s capital city.\n\nLibertarian Gregory Boles is also on the ballot, running on a platform of legalizing drugs and abolishing the Department of Education, according to his Facebook page.\n\nTEACHERS REVOLT\n\nAt least 36 current or former educators are running for seats in Kentucky\u2019s state legislature. Most are Democrats, angry at the Republican-controlled legislature for passing laws allowing charter schools and making changes to the pension system. It will be tough for Democrats to win control of either the House or the Senate, where Republicans have large majorities. But they could win back enough seats to frustrate Republican plans heading into the 2019 elections for governor and other statewide constitutional offices.\n\nROWAN COUNTY CLERK\n\nRowan County Clerk Kim Davis went to jail in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses after same-sex marriage became legal. Now, she\u2019s facing the voters as she runs for a second term. Davis faces Democrat Elwood Caudill Jr. in a rematch of the 2014 Democratic primary, where Davis won by 23 votes. Davis is now a Republican. Caudill has sought to downplay the marriage license controversy, while promising he will treat everyone equally. Davis has doubled down on her decision , saying she was protecting the state Constitution.\n\nMARSY\u2019S LAW\n\nA proposed amendment to Kentucky\u2019s Constitution would guarantee crime victims have the right to be notified and present for most court proceedings. It would also give them \u201cstanding\u201d to hire a lawyer and ask a judge to enforce those rights. It\u2019s known as \u201cMarsy\u2019s Law\u201d in memory of a slain California college student. Kentucky is one of six states voting on the amendment. The Kentucky Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys opposes it, saying it will have unintended consequences .\n\nThe election is Nov. 6, but the results will be on hold. That\u2019s because a state judge ruled the question on the ballot is unconstitutionally vague. The ruling is being appealed, but a final decision won\u2019t come until after the election. That means the votes will be counted, but state officials will wait to certify the results.\n\nSUPREME COURT\n\nKentucky Supreme Court Justice Daniel Venters is retiring. Two state judges are running to replace him. Debra Hembree Lambert, currently a Court of Appeals judge, has raised the most money for the nonpartisan race. Dan Ballou, a circuit judge for McCreary and Whitley counties since 2007, has an endorsement from Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul. The district covers 27 counties in southern and south-central Kentucky.\n\nMAYOR\u2019S RACES\n\nKentucky\u2019s two largest cities will elect mayors Tuesday. In Louisville, Democratic incumbent Greg Fischer faces Republican Metro Councilwoman Angela Leet. In Lexington , former Vice Mayor Linda Gorton faces former Lexington Police Chief Ronnie Bastin in a nonpartisan race. They want to replace outgoing Mayor Jim Gray, who has endorsed Gorton.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Authorities release name of man who died while windsurfing\n\nSANDY HOOK, N.J.

(AP Photo/Steven Senne)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 There\u2019s no escaping the impact President Donald Trump has had on the midterm elections, even in Massachusetts where polling shows him to be deeply unpopular with the majority of the state\u2019s voters.\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Jay Gonzalez has tried to take Republican Gov. Charlie Baker to task for not being forceful enough in his criticism of Trump, even though the incumbent has repeatedly rebuked White House policy and the president himself over the past couple of years.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a possible presidential contender in 2020, has often used her Republican challenger Geoff Diehl as a foil for Trump as she seeks re-election to the Senate.\n\nMassachusetts voters on Tuesday will also decide races for the U.S. House, the Legislature, other state and county officers and three statewide ballot initiatives, including a first-in-the-nation vote on a transgender rights law.\n\nA closer look at some of the key races Tuesday:\n\n___\n\nGOVERNOR\n\nIt\u2019s been an uphill climb for Gonzalez, who has trailed throughout the race in polling and been heavily outspent by the incumbent. In fact, the $2.25 million spent by Baker\u2019s campaign during the second half of October was more than the $2.18 million Gonzalez had raised throughout his entire campaign, according to the most recent state campaign finance records.\n\nIn debates, Gonzalez has pointed to Baker\u2019s endorsement \u2014 albeit tepid \u2014 of Diehl and other pro-Trump candidates sharing the Republican ticket with him in Massachusetts. Baker has said only that he is keeping his promise to endorse fellow GOP candidates.\n\nThe Democrat has also attempted to chip away at Baker\u2019s edge by labeling the Republican a \u201cstatus quo\u201d governor while positioning himself as a reformer. He\u2019s advocated for major investments in public transportation and education, and backed a single-payer health care system.\n\nBaker and state Republicans have, in turn, questioned how Gonzalez would pay for his initiatives, especially after the state\u2019s highest court struck down a proposed 4 percent surtax on the state\u2019s highest earners.\n\n___\n\nUS SENATE\n\nWarren is heavily favored to defeat Diehl, a state representative from Whitman, in what both supporters and detractors of the incumbent view as a potential warmup for a national race against Trump in 2020.\n\nThe Democrat has portrayed her opponent as someone who would vote \u201c100 percent of the time\u201d to support Trump\u2019s agenda. Diehl was the co-chair of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts and doesn\u2019t hide his support for the president, though has promised if elected to vote first to protect the state\u2019s interests.\n\nDiehl has charged that Warren is already looking past her current re-election campaign and would soon abandon Massachusetts to focus on a run for the White House.\n\nWarren, one of Trump\u2019s fiercest critics in Congress, hasn\u2019t exactly discouraged the speculation. She recently said she would take a \u201chard look\u201d at running for president once the Senate election is over.

It marks the first statewide referendum in the U.S. on a transgender law and is being watched closely by LGBT rights groups around the nation.\n\nA \u201cno\u201d vote Tuesday would repeal the law, which opponents claim gives male sexual predators freedom to enter private spaces for women by claiming female gender identity. Those arguments are dismissed as scare tactics by the law\u2019s supporters who say no such incidents have been reported since the law was passed.\n\nThe ballot initiative that has generated the most spending on both sides is Question 1, which if passed would make Massachusetts the second state, after California, to mandate specific nurse-to-patient ratios in hospitals.\n\nSupporters say the staffing requirements would make patients safer. Opponents argue it could have the opposite effect by creating an overly rigid system that could potentially force hospitals to turn patients away.\n\nBoth sides claim in TV ads and on campaign signs to have the backing of nurses.\n\nAnother ballot initiative \u2014 Question 2 \u2014 ask voters to establish a special state commission as a first step toward a constitutional amendment to undo the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling, which held that held corporations and unions could spend unlimited money to influence elections.\n\n___\n\nTURNOUT\n\nSecretary of State William Galvin, Massachusetts\u2019 top elections official, has predicted about 2.4 million residents will have cast ballots by the time the polls close on Election Day, including about 585,000 who availed themselves of the state\u2019s early voting period.\n\nIf true, that would exceed turnout in the last two midterm elections, 2014 and 2010.\n\nGalvin said Monday many voters in Massachusetts, as elsewhere, appear more motivated by national politics than by state or local issues.", "LONDON (AP) \u2014 British police have charged a south London man with preparing a terrorist act and collecting information likely to be useful to a person preparing an attack.\n\nPolice said Monday that 40-year-old Steven Bishop has been charged with violating the Terrorism Act and will appear in Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court on Tuesday.

Matt Mead, who is term-limited. Trauner seeks to deny Republican Sen. John Barrasso a second full term.\n\nVoter registration figures alone show tough odds for Throne and Trauner.

Texas had been the last team to do that, in 2010 and 2011. (AP Photo/Stephen Hawkins)\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Chris Woodward grew up wanting to be an architect or an engineer. He also had what he thought was a far-fetched dream of playing professional baseball.\n\nThe kid from California who was a 54th-round draft pick and went on to play 12 major league seasons as a utility infielder for five teams is now the manager of one of the youngest teams in the majors. The Texas Rangers formally introduced Woodward as their new manager Monday, two days after hiring the Los Angeles Dodgers third base coach.\n\n\u201cI share a common bond with most Rangers fans right now. This has actually taken away the sting of losing two World Series in a row,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cA lot of Rangers fans, obviously I feel your pain, it\u2019s real, I get it. ... I know how to get to the World Series. I\u2019m going to instill a philosophy and a belief and a process in place to get us to that point.\u201d\n\nWoodward\u2019s introduction as a first-time big league manager came just more than a week after the Dodgers lost in the World Series for the second year in a row. Texas had been the last team to do that, in 2010 and 2011.\n\nThe Rangers are coming off consecutive losing seasons for the first time since 2005-08. They lost 95 games this year when the focus turned the development of younger players \u2014 seven position players 25 or younger played at least 106 games.\n\n\u201cIdeally what we\u2019re putting in place here is the beginning of the foundation of a championship belief and culture,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many wins we\u2019re going to have next year but that championship belief, I believe, is powerful and it\u2019s important to instill in these younger players now.\u201d\n\nGeneral manager Jon Daniels described the 42-year-old Woodward as an \u201cenergetic, winning manager to help us drive the culture here at the major league level. We\u2019re all going to grow together, we\u2019re all going to win together.\u201d\n\nDaniels said the Rangers met with or spoke by phone with about 15 candidates after Jeff Banister was fired Sept. 21. Texas won AL West titles in Banister\u2019s first two seasons (2014 and 2015).\n\nAs a player, Woodward spent parts of 12 seasons (1999-2011) with Toronto, the New York Mets, Seattle, Atlanta and Boston. He hit .239 with 33 home runs and 191 RBIs while playing every position except pitcher and catcher. Woodward said he played for 11 different managers during his career, several of them first-year managers. He also played for Bobby Cox one season in Atlanta.\n\nHis coaching career began as a minor league infield coordinator for the Mariners in 2013 and he joined their big league staff later that year. He spent the past three seasons on Dave Roberts\u2019 staff in Los Angeles.\n\nWoodward said he wants to create a culture where players can learn and grow every single day. He said that is what he will place the most value on moving forward.\n\n\u201cProcess is a big one for me, I don\u2019t like to think of results,\u201d he said. \u201cI think young kids, young players nowadays, they get caught up in results. ... I want to drive home the process that\u2019s going to get them the results.\u201d\n\nWoodward said he had to fight every day as a \u201cvery average, probably below average\u201d player and has always had that same kind of energy as a coach. He said it important to relate that to players.\n\nThe new manager will wear No. 8, and donned that jersey Monday for the first time in the big leagues. Yes, he was a fan of Cal Ripken Jr. growing up. But that was also the number of Woodward\u2019s high school coach Tom Quinley, a Yankees fan who revered Yogi Berra (who also wore No. 8).\n\n\u201cHe passed away this past season, and it was very emotional for me,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cHe took the role of many things for me, obviously as a mentor, as a father figure. He did everything for me. I wouldn\u2019t be here today if it wasn\u2019t for him. ... It\u2019s pretty special to me, and obviously in honor of him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "FILE- In this Oct. 10, 2018, file photo a voter casts their ballot at the Hamilton County Board of Elections on the first day of early voting in Cincinnati. The midterm elections are certain to have implications for Wall Street, regardless of how they shape the balance of power in Congress. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The midterm elections are certain to have implications for Wall Street, regardless of how they shape the balance of power in Congress.\n\nThat\u2019s because in every scenario there could be winners and losers in key sectors of the market, including banking, pharmaceuticals, companies that would benefit from government infrastructure projects and those that rely on healthy consumer spending, analysts say.\n\nThe scenario deemed most likely by recent polls and analyst projections has Democrats regaining control of the House of Representatives and Republicans keeping control of the Senate. The odds are longer for Republicans or Democrats emerging with majorities in both chambers.\n\n\u201cDivided government equals gridlock,\u201d said Terry Haines, head of US policy and political analysis at Evercore ISI. \u201cGridlock is a good thing for markets because markets like certainty.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how the market might react to the different scenarios:\n\nSPLIT DECISION\n\nIn the scenario where Democrats regain control of the House, major policy initiatives from the White House will be dead on arrival. Compromise could be difficult, especially if the Democrats move to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Democrats might find common ground with the GOP in some areas. Agreement on an infrastructure bill could give a boost to construction equipment and transportation companies. And legislation to control drug pricing would likely be a drag on pharmaceutical company stocks.\n\nA Democrat-led House could also lead to heightened oversight and investigations of big banks and Wall Street firms, which could weigh on financial sector stocks.\n\nThe possibility of a government shutdown also increases with a divided Congress, according to a report from UBS on the potential impact of the midterm elections. That could unnerve investors. The S&P 500 slumped nearly 20 percent during the government shutdown that occurred during Congress\u2019 2011 debt ceiling impasse.\n\nTHE BLUE WAVE\n\nThe odds of the Democrats taking both houses of Congress have diminished of late, possibly to the relief of Wall Street.\n\nIn this scenario, Democrats could push to shore up the Affordable Care Act, but any move to reverse the Trump administration\u2019s hefty tax cut on corporations or its steady rollback of government regulations on businesses could be fruitless in the face of Trump\u2019s veto.\n\n\u201cWith this in mind, this election is really about how dysfunctional Washington will be for the second half of President Trump\u2019s first term,\u201d Mike Ryan, chief investment officer, Americas, for UBS Global Wealth Management, noted in the company\u2019s report.\n\nMORE OF THE SAME\n\nShould Republicans remain in control of Congress, it\u2019s likely the Trump administration will try to make the personal tax cuts included in last year\u2019s reform package permanent. Also, on the possible to-do list: reforming entitlements, more easing of government regulations on banks and other businesses and perhaps tackling the issue of drug price controls, according to the UBS report.\n\nIf the GOP extends its majority, there also could be a push to lower capital gains taxes and enact an infrastructure spending bill.\n\nThe midterms add to the uncertainty that has buffeted the market for the past month.\n\nAfter a solid third quarter that saw records for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials, stocks have swooned on fears that rising interest rates and the U.S. trade dispute with China could undo some of the benefits of the GOP tax cuts and eventually squeeze corporate profit margins. October snapped a six-month winning streak for the S&P 500, giving the benchmark index its worst monthly loss in seven years.\n\nStill, regardless of how the midterm elections turn out, history suggests stocks will be fine.\n\nThe S&P 500 has generated an average price return of 16.7 percent in the 12 months after each of the midterm elections going back to 1946, according to CFRA. That\u2019s 18 elections, many of which ended up shuffling the balance of power in Congress.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that under every political makeup in Washington, stocks have gone up and the economy has grown,\u201d said Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones.", "WICHITA, Kan.

All the political parties in Kansas added to their ranks, while the number of unaffiliated voters fell.\n\nDemocrats grew their ranks to 463,114 voters, comprising slightly more than 25 percent of total voters eligible to cast a ballot in the upcoming election.

Libertarians trailed with 17,618 voter registrations.\n\n\u201cWhere the movement has occurred in the last 20 years is the slow drop of Democrats and the subsequent rise of unaffiliateds,\u201d Beatty said. \u201cSo, what the new numbers show is a halt to that shift to unaffiliateds and a small comeback for Democrats.\u201d\n\nKansas has added 40,825 people to its voter rolls since September 2017.

President Donald Trump withdrew from the accord in May, saying it did not address Iran\u2019s regional military activities and other issues.\n\nIran\u2019s national currency, the rial, has plummeted for months and is now trading at 150,000 to one U.S. dollar, compared to around 40,500 a year ago. The new sanctions will likely undermine the rial even more since they target Iran\u2019s oil industry, a crucial source of hard currency. They also target dozens of Iranian banks, aiming to push the financial sector deeper into isolation.\n\nThe result has been skyrocketing prices for everything from clothes and transportation to food.\n\n\u201cCheck the shops here one by one, there are no customers,\u201d said Hossein Ahmadi, whose purse shop is located on a normally busy commercial street in the Iranian capital. \u201cPeople have kept their money for rainy days out of fear of sanctions while rent of the shop has gone up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain this to my wife and children,\u201d he said.\n\nAt nearby clothes shops, a few women looked through the scarves and coats.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are not able to buy these things anymore,\u201d said one 22-year-old shopper, Mina Sholeh.\n\nWashington has issued a list of 12 demands Iran must meet to get the sanctions lifted, including ending its support for regional militant groups, withdrawing from the civil war in Syria \u2014 where it backs President Bashar Assad \u2014 and halting its development of ballistic missiles. On Friday, Trump said the objective is \u201cto force the regime into a clear choice: either abandon its destructive behavior or continue down the path toward economic disaster.\u201d\n\nIn large part, the bet is that Iran\u2019s leadership will be pressured by public outrage. Iran\u2019s economic chaos sparked anti-government protests at the end of last year which resulted in nearly 5,000 reported arrests and at least 25 people being killed. At the time, the Trump administration cheered the protests.\n\nDemonstrations have become sporadic and rare.

Henry McMaster, left, and Democratic challenger, state Rep. James Smith meet during a debate, Thursday, Oct. 25, 2018 at Greenville Technical College in Greenville, S.C. (Lauren Petracca/The Post And Courier via AP)\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) \u2014 Both candidates launched into the final day of campaigning Monday in South Carolina\u2019s gubernatorial race, a contest in which President Donald Trump has played a pivotal role even before taking office himself.\n\nGov. Henry McMaster entered his last day on the trail in hope of being elected to an office he\u2019s held for nearly two years, since stepping up from lieutenant governor last year after Nikki Haley\u2019s departure to serve as U.N. Ambassador.\n\nA year earlier, McMaster had been the first statewide-elected official in the country to back Trump\u2019s candidacy, raising the eyebrows of many of the establishment Republican\u2019s closest advisers. McMaster, however, remained firm in his decision and ultimately went on to deliver a nominating speech for Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention.\n\nOn Monday, McMaster, 71, planned to fly around the state for news conferences in Columbia, North Charleston, Myrtle Beach and Greenville. In the campaign\u2019s closing days, the longtime GOP politician has stumped across the state with his running mate, businesswoman Pamela Evette, doing a bus tour and meeting with voters in all corners of South Carolina.\n\nThe Republican faces off Tuesday with Democrat James Smith, a state representative who\u2019s spent the end of the campaign crisscrossing the state in an RV. On Monday, he and running mate Mandy Powers Norrell planned to campaign in the conservative Upstate before holding a final rally in Columbia.\n\nSmith, 51, is a Columbia attorney and 22-year veteran of the state House, where he has held leadership positions. Also serving as a JAG officer in the US Army Reserve and South Carolina Army National Guard, he resigned his commission after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to enlist in the infantry, ultimately serving in Afghanistan.\n\nIn this race, Smith has backing from former Vice President Joe Biden, who recorded a video for Smith\u2019s candidacy and appeared at a fundraiser for him last month. Smith has also worked to appeal to Republicans, acknowledging he will need crossover support if he\u2019s going to oust McMaster in this heavily-Republican state.\n\nKathryn Whitaker, a legal marketer in Mount Pleasant, said she backed what she considers to be Smith\u2019s inclusive message, which offers a pledge to expand Medicaid if elected.\n\n\u201cI appreciate James\u2019 message that he wants to be a governor for us all,\u201d said Whitaker, 36. \u201cLiving in an area with an increasingly high rich-poor gap, it\u2019s important to me that our elected officials care about ensuring housing, education, and health care opportunities for all our neighbors. I\u2019m convinced James does.\u201d\n\nEdward Earwood, a nonprofit executive director in Lexington, said he supports Trump\u2019s policies overall but that the president didn\u2019t factor into his vote for McMaster in the governor\u2019s race.\n\n\u201cMcMaster operates much more closely to my core values - pro-life, free enterprise, second amendment, etc., than his opponent,\u201d Earwood, 61, said.\n\nAside from McMaster\u2019s contest, there is only one other race in South Carolina attracting prominent out-of-state interest. In the coastal 1st U.S. House District, which stretches from Charleston to Hilton Head Island, state Rep. Katie Arrington is trying to hold on to the seat after ousting incumbent Mark Sanford in the Republican primary.\n\nDemocratic candidate Joe Cunningham has run a broad-reaching campaign, receiving the endorsements of Republican mayors along the coast, due to his continual opposition to offshore drilling. That put Arrington on the defensive for her full-on support of Trump, which had helped her defeat Sanford.\n\nCunningham has repeatedly reminded voters that Arrington mirrored Trump in supporting offshore drilling for oil, something even Republicans in the coastal district worry could harm the state\u2019s beaches and tourism. Arrington has since backed away from her support of the issue.\n\nIn a sign of how tight the race might be, Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s wife, Karen, campaigned for Arrington on Saturday, and Donald Trump Jr. planned to campaign with her Monday afternoon. The president taped a phone message to thousands of voters in the district Sunday, calling Cunningham a liberal who would raise taxes.\n\nCunningham has said dozens of times he is not liberal and would not support Nancy Pelosi to return as Speaker if Democrats take back the U.S. House.\n\n\u201cYou know it\u2019s a tight race when Katie Arrington brings in @realDonaldTrump to call me names,\u201d Cunningham responded on Twitter . \u201cThat\u2019s okay.

(AP Photos/Bebeto Matthews, left, and Julio Cortez, Files)\n\nALBANY, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 Some of the hottest congressional races in the country will be decided in New York on Tuesday, including one featuring an indicted incumbent, while voters also decide whether Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo deserves a third term.\n\nTurnout is expected to be high with voters eager to weigh in on the nation\u2019s divided politics.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what to watch:\n\nCONGRESS: A handful of contentious races \u2014 mostly upstate \u2014 could help decide whether the Democrats wrest control of the U.S. House from Republicans.\n\nIn western New York, Republican U.S. Rep. Chris Collins had been considered a safe bet for re-election before federal authorities charged him with insider trading. Collins, who has pleaded not guilty and called the charges meritless, initially suspended his campaign for a fourth term. But then he reversed course and got back in the race, confounding local Republican leaders who had been working to replace his name on the ballot.\n\nDemocratic challenger Nate McMurray, the Grand Island town supervisor, reported a flood of contributions following Collins\u2019 indictment. That support could be critical if Democrats hope to win the district, where Donald Trump thumped Hillary Clinton by 24 percentage points \u2014 his largest margin in the state. Polls show the race is close.\n\nIn the Hudson Valley, freshmen GOP Congressman John Faso is looking to defend his seat against Democrat Antonio Delgado in a swing district that supported Trump in 2016 but Democrat Barack Obama four years earlier. An ad released last month by the Republican National Congressional Committee showed clips of Delgado performing songs from his 2006 rap album. Delgado, a Rhodes scholar and Harvard Law School graduate, said it was a racially motivated attack on a black candidate in a district that is more than 90 percent white.\n\nIn central New York, first-term Republican U.S. Rep. Claudia Tenney is locked in a tight battle with Democrat Anthony Brindisi, a state lawmaker. Tenney\u2019s brash rhetoric has drawn comparisons to Trump and turned off many in her own party: She claimed without evidence that \u201cso many\u201d mass murderers are Democrats and urged people to sign a petition seeking the imprisonment of Hillary Clinton and former FBI Director James Comey.\n\nTenney was an early Trump backer and says that while she sometimes disagrees with the president her working relationship with the administration helps her advocate for voters in her district, which includes rolling dairy farms and the cities of Utica and Binghamton. The race is considered a tossup.\n\nOther races to watch include one on Staten Island, where Army veteran Max Rose, a Democrat, hopes to oust U.S. Rep. Dan Donovan, the only Republican House member from New York City. And in Queens and the Bronx, Republican Anthony Pappas is looking to beat the odds and defeat Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who scored a huge upset over U.S. Rep. Joe Crowley earlier this year.\n\nOn the Senate side, Democratic New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is heavily favored over Republican Chele Farley.\n\nGOVERNOR\u2019S RACE: Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo is seeking a third term as the leader of the nation\u2019s fourth-largest state \u2014 a distinction that would put him in the company of former governors DeWitt Clinton, Al Smith, Nelson Rockefeller, George Pataki and his own father, the late Mario Cuomo.\n\nHe faces Republican Marc Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, as well as Libertarian Larry Sharpe, Green Party nominee Howie Hawkins and independent Stephanie Miner. Polls show Cuomo is far ahead in the race, and he has a commanding financial advantage.\n\nCuomo has sought to make the race about Trump, mocking Molinaro as a \u201cTrump Mini-Me\u201d and saying he is the best candidate to protect the state from any efforts to eliminate protections for immigrants, abortion rights or the environment. Considered a possible White House contender, Cuomo has said he will serve a full four years if re-elected.\n\nThough polls show the race has tightened, Cuomo maintains a commanding lead.\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL: The job of the state\u2019s top law enforcement official has increasingly focused on Trump, too, with incumbent Attorney General Barbara Underwood and her predecessor, disgraced Democrat Eric Schneiderman, launching investigations into the president and his business dealings and filing lawsuits seeking to block the administration\u2019s policy moves.\n\nDemocrat Tish James, the New York City public advocate, faces Republican attorney Keith Wofford in the race. Underwood is not running for a full term after replacing Schneiderman, who resigned earlier this year after he was accused of assaulting four women he dated. He has denied the charges.\n\nNo matter who wins, the victor will make history as the state\u2019s first black attorney general. They\u2019ve sparred over the attorney general\u2019s role in fighting Trump, with James arguing for an aggressive response to the White House, while Wofford says he would only pursue cases that clearly benefit the state or residents.\n\nIn another statewide race, Democratic state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli faces Republican Jonathan Trichter. DiNapoli has served as comptroller since 2007. The office performs government audits, reviews state finances and manages the $207 billion state pension fund.\n\nSTATE SENATE: All 213 seats in the state Legislature are up for election, but the attention is on the 63 seats in the state Senate, now the last bastion of Republican control in Albany.\n\nDemocrats need to only pick up a few seats in order to win the chamber. They already hold a huge majority in the state Assembly and occupy the governor\u2019s office. Adding the Senate to that list would potentially ease the way for liberal priorities, such as codifying abortion rights in state law, legalizing marijuana and loosening the statute of limitations on molestation to make it easier for victims to sue their alleged abusers.", "CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 Two prominent Republican politicians are among a pack of attorneys and judges competing Tuesday for a pair of West Virginia Supreme Court positions vacated by justices caught up in a scandal over spending by the court.\n\nEx-U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins and former House of Delegates speaker Tim Armstead were appointed by GOP Gov. Jim Justice to fill the seats until the election. Now both are running to fill the unexpired terms on West Virginia\u2019s highest court.\n\nArmstead is running against seven attorneys and two circuit judges to complete the term of retired Justice Menis Ketchum. Other candidates include circuit judges Joanna Tabit and Chris Wilkes as well as attorneys Harry Bruner Jr., Robert Carlton, Ronald Hatfield, Mark Hunt, Hiram Lewis IV, D.C. Offutt Jr. and Jeff Woods. The term runs through 2020.\n\nJenkins is among 10 candidates vying for the seat of retired Justice Robin Davis, whose term runs through 2024. Another well-known political figure running for Davis\u2019 unexpired term is Democratic former state Senate President Jeff Kessler.

Frank, Brenden Long, Jim O\u2019Brien, Marty \u201cRedshoes\u201d Sheehan, William Schwartz and Dennise Renee Smith.\n\nJudicial elections in West Virginia became nonpartisan in 2016, but the court\u2019s turmoil stirred political attacks. Some Democrats argued that the court\u2019s shakeup was a power grab by the Republican-led legislature.\n\nThe House of Delegates in August impeached Davis and Justices Allen Loughry, Beth Walker and Margaret Workman over questions involving lavish office renovations that evolved into accusations of corruption, incompetence and neglect of duty. Ketchum resigned before the impeachment vote to avoid trial. Davis retired immediately after the August vote.", "FILE - In this Aug. 5, 2017 file photo, St. Louis Cardinals relief pitcher Trevor Rosenthal (44) throws against the Cincinnati Reds during the ninth inning of a baseball game in Cincinnati.

No hiccups. I felt really good the whole time. Almost too good,\u201d Rosenthal said Monday during a conference call with reporters. \u201cEspecially there, after the All-Star break, I was kind of anxious, thinking I might be able to pitch before the season was over. But the plan all along from my doctor was just to take this year off, so we stuck with that plan.\u201d\n\nRosenthal, the former St. Louis Cardinals closer, agreed last week to a deal with the Nationals, who officially announced Saturday that they signed him.\n\nHe joins holdover lefty closer Sean Doolittle at the back of Washington\u2019s bullpen.\n\nRosenthal said he hasn\u2019t \u201creally had too many conversations\u201d yet with the Nationals about how they plan to use him.\n\n\u201cObviously, I mean, I think the plan is just being in high-leverage situations and hopefully, as a team, we\u2019re winning a lot of games and have a lot of those opportunities to go around,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for me, it\u2019s not something where I need to know exactly what my role is going to be.\u201d\n\nRosenthal also said he doesn\u2019t think there will be any sort of \u201chard stop or exact limitations to what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d in terms of number of innings or appearances as he returns from the reconstructive elbow surgery.\n\nIn Washington, he\u2019ll be reunited with Nationals pitching coach Derek Lilliquist, who used to hold that position with the Cardinals.\n\nThe Nationals gave Rosenthal a 2019 contract that guarantees him $7 million and gives the righty a chance to earn an additional $8 million in performance bonuses. The agreement includes a $15 million conditional player option for 2020 that kicks in if Rosenthal appears in 50 games next year or has 30 games finished.\n\nThe 28-year-old Rosenthal is a hard-thrower with 121 career saves, all for the Cardinals, including a career-high 48 in 2015, when he was an NL All-Star. He had 45 saves in 2014.\n\nHe had only 14 saves in 2016, and 11 in 2017 before getting injured. Rosenthal was released by the Cardinals in November 2017, a few months after his operation.\n\n\u201cBy the time I started throwing, I was really chomping at the bit to get back into it. And I had done so much exercises and rehabilitation work that my arm probably felt the best it\u2019s felt in the past five or six years,\u201d Rosenthal said. \u201cSo I was excited to try it out \u2014 and also kind of let down when I did do my first throwing session and I realized that I was only allowed to throw it a maximum of 40 feet and for only so many throws. I was like, \u2018Really? That was it?\u2019 I\u2019m used to throwing really hard for an extended amount of time, every single day.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Kansas Athletic Director Jeff Long discusses the decision to fire head football coach David Beaty during a news conference on Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, in Lawrence, Kan. (Chris Neal/The Topeka Capital-Journal via AP)\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Jeff Long made the challenge facing him in hiring the next football coach at Kansas clear when the Jayhawks\u2019 athletic director mentioned several times one obvious if oft-overlooked fact about picking the right candidate to lead his program.\n\n\u201cThe most difficult part,\u201d Long said late Sunday, hours after firing fourth-year coach David Beaty, \u201cis trying to figure out who is really interested in your job and who is just playing the game.\u201d\n\nLong heard from several coaches and agents after informing Beaty he would be let go after the season. In acknowledging that some may merely use interest in Kansas to earn a raise or promotion elsewhere, Long also admitted there isn\u2019t a whole lot of shine to the job.\n\nThe program hasn\u2019t had a winning season or reached a bowl game since 2008. Fan apathy is at such low levels that more than half of the roughly 15,000 fans who turned up Saturday were there to support Iowa State. And the resources the school has made available for football are dwarfed by its Big 12 rivals.\n\nThe last of those is something Long promised to address.\n\nHe said Kansas has low-balled its pay to coaches over the years, and that the miserly approach extends far beyond the head coach. Long said the program has about 15 fewer staff members than the average Power Five program \u2014 the behind-the-scenes quality control coaches, recruiting coordinators and other support staff \u2014 and that the pay of those on staff is also far too low.\n\nSo, along with hiring a new coach, Long wanted to make it clear that the priorities for Kansas are about to change. He is putting a massive, $300 million renovation to Memorial Stadium \u201con simmer,\u201d Long said, and instead redirecting resources toward building up the program.\n\n\u201cPeople understand we have to make a great commitment, and that commitment is financial resources, plain and simple,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now we have to invest in our program rather than our stadium.\u201d\n\nSome names have already been batted around by fans watching the coach search, including former Oklahoma State and LSU coach Les Miles and current North Carolina State coach Dave Doeren, a Kansas native and former Jayhawks assistant.\n\nRegardless of who it is, the new coach will find a program in better shape than Beaty did.\n\nThe roster is the most competitive it\u2019s been in years, highlighted by promising young players such as running back Pooka Williams and defensive back Corione Harris. The school recently completed work to its offices and locker rooms, and a sorely needed indoor practice facility is under construction.\n\nAnd while the football team may always be overshadowed by the Jayhawks\u2019 powerhouse men\u2019s basketball team, Long believes that having one successful program doesn\u2019t preclude them from having another.\n\n\u201cMy expectation,\u201d he said, \u201cis that the football program should be bowl-bound on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nLong wants someone with major college experience, something that Beaty \u2014 a career assistant and former offensive coordinator \u2014 did not possess. He also would like someone with experience in building a program as Kansas skids toward its 10th consecutive losing season.\n\nLong said he would not exclude high-level assistant coaches or NFL coaches from his search, but he did admit that they would not necessarily be his priority.\n\n\u201cThese jobs are too big to learn on the job,\u201d Long said.\n\nThe ideal candidate, he continued, will also bring much-needed energy and recruiting chops to the job. The program has been so downtrodden for years that not even an upset win over TCU a couple weeks ago did anything to move the needle, while the challenges of recruiting to Kansas given its history of losing and the fact that there are few prospects in its own backyard are daunting.\n\nAs for a timeline, Long said he wants to have someone in place \u201csooner than later,\u201d and perhaps even before Beaty finishes out the season. The early signing date for recruits in December makes timing of the essence, and it\u2019s a big reason why Long decided to make the change this past weekend.\n\n\u201cThere have been a number of candidates that have sought me out to know they were interested. Some of them I thought about before the announcement,\u201d Long said. \u201cBut there really isn\u2019t a front-runner. I want a leader of young men, someone with a history and track record of building a program, because we need that. But I hope our fanbase understands it\u2019s not a quick-fix thing. We have a lot of challenges.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "COLUMBUS, N.M. (AP) \u2014 When the two men with a self-described militia showed up offering Columbus Mayor Esequiel Salas help protecting the border, the conversation was brief and polite.\n\n\u201cI told them, \u2019We have a good relationship with Mexico, with our little sister village Palomas,\u201d said Salas, referring to the community just across the border.\n\n\u201cA lot of people who never come here, they have a misunderstanding. They hear things that are not true.\u201d\n\nWhile rumors and heated rhetoric about a crisis on the border contribute to rising tensions, border communities are caught in the middle.\n\nIn Columbus, home to about 1,600 residents, the mayor and other villagers were perplexed by the arrival of a small band of men with the Patriots of the Constitution militia. The men said they were there scouting locations to prepare for the migrant caravan from Central America slowly making its way through Mexico toward the southwest border.\n\nThe number of those in the caravan has dwindled from about 7,000 to 3,500 people. President Donald Trump announced last week that he planned to deploy 15,000 troops to the border to meet the caravan he referred to as an \u201cinvasion\u201d and he vowed to set up tents to hold Central Americans who he said will likely be denied asylum and be deported. The caravan appears headed for Texas. A previous caravan\u2019s final destination was California.\n\nSome residents are expressing concern about armed militias making their way to the border.\n\n\u201cThey should not be patrolling the border if they were not sent by the federal government,\u201d said Martin Garcia, a Columbus resident, as he watched over farmworkers picking red chile in a field that borders Mexico. \u201cIf the U.S. wants to send soldiers, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u2018Stop the bad guys\u2019\n\nAt a hotel in town Wednesday, a few members of the militia rested and waited for nightfall to patrol the border. One of their trucks in the parking lot had an \u201cISIS hunting\u201d decal on the bottom of the windshield.\n\nAs one of the militiamen paced in front of the hotel, smoking and talking on his phone, another sat in a chair on the second-floor balcony holding binoculars.\n\nThey were spurred to action by news of thousands of Central American migrants in a caravan headed for the border, said Jim Peyton, a 71-year-old retired Detroit police officer.\n\nPeyton drove 1,355 miles from Jasper, Alabama, where he now lives, to Columbus.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only armed for self-defense,\u201d he said. The goal of the militia is to \u201cstop the bad guys.\u201d He declined the Journal\u2019s request to photograph him.\n\nPeyton said he and his second in command checked in with U.S. Customs and Border Protection as soon as they arrived in Columbus, as well as with the mayor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to assist when possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the authority to touch, corral, interfere. That would be illegal because we are not authorized to do so.\u201d\n\nPeyton said Border Patrol asked that the group stay north of Highway 9 to avoid confusion when agents are tracking footprints and other traffic from illegal border crossers.\n\n\u201cWe are aware a group of people have arrived in New Mexico with the goal of \u2018patrolling\u2019 the border but they are not working in conjunction with the Border Patrol,\u201d according to a statement from the El Paso Border Patrol sector, which includes all of New Mexico.\n\nExtra eyes, ears\n\nThe militia will serve as extra eyes and ears near the border and notify Border Patrol dispatch if they spot illegal crossings or smuggling, according to Peyton.\n\nPeyton said he is spending a lot of his time on the phone calming fears about the caravan.\n\n\u201cA woman from Florida was in tears calling me, thought she was going to die,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking this as they\u2019re going to knock on their door and blow their brains out. That\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\nPatriots of the Constitution put out a call via social media Oct. 23 for \u201cA FULL DEPLOYMENT OF EVERY ABLE BODY U.S. CITIZEN to Head to the U.S. Southern Border and Link up with other U.S. Citizen Groups whom are making a Stand to Secure our Border from a Mob of Migrating Immigrants.\u201d The organization is among patriot militia groups committed to defending the Constitution and, in some cases, the border.\n\nPeyton said there are volunteers ready to help in Arizona, California and Texas.\n\n\u201cIt was reported to us this was a soft spot, but so far we have not seen much of anything. But, then again, the caravan hasn\u2019t really arrived and there\u2019s a second one coming up,\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.N. Refugee Agency providing assistance in Mexico said many of those traveling in the caravan are families.\n\nPeyton believes the caravan is a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d hiding ISIS, MS-13 and cartel gang members, as well as Nigerians and Venezuelans. He would not say how many militia members were in Columbus, but several people in the village said it was less than a handful of volunteers.\n\nCaravan a \u2018decoy\u2019?\n\nDavid Miller, 59, drove from Alamogordo with his dog Snow after hearing a call for volunteers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my country,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIf we\u2019re getting invaded, shouldn\u2019t we help?\u201d\n\nMiller called the migrant families in the caravan a \u201cdecoy\u201d for gang members trying to sneak into the country.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not coming for ice cream and cake,\u201d he said.\n\nMiller is doing odd jobs in Columbus to earn money to get his truck repaired.

The organization is technically nonpartisan, but several on its list of celebrity co-chairs such as Tom Hanks and Chris Paul have been vocal critics of President Donald Trump.\n\nLyft is also working with Voto Latino \u2014 whose co-founder Rosario Dawson has urged voters to choose Democrats to combat Trump\u2019s immigration policies \u2014 as well as nonprofit organizations that help blind people and student veterans to distribute discount codes and identify where free rides are needed. Lyft\u2019s efforts have been promoted on social media by celebrities such as actor Samuel Jackson, another Trump critic.\n\nUber is offering $10 off rides to the polls across the country and added a feature in its app that helps customers find their polling stations by typing in a home address.\n\n\u201cIn this critically important election, we want to do our part and use Uber\u2019s technology to help drive the vote,\u201d said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in an email. \u201cDecisions get made by those who show up and we believe Uber can help voters show up like never before.\u201d\n\nZipcar, which allows members to rent cars on an hourly basis, is offering a $20 credit on election night, enough to cover about two hours of driving, said spokeswoman Katelyn Chesley. Zipcar has been offering discounts for election-related rides since the company was founded in 2000, Chesley said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who have really busy schedules during the daytime, and we just really want to make sure every last voice is heard,\u201d Chesley said.\n\nThis is the second time Lyft has offered discounted or free rides to the polls and Uber\u2019s first.\n\nIn 2016, 15 million eligible voters cited transportation as a key reason why they didn\u2019t vote, according to The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University, so \u201cwe want to use our platform to eliminate that pain point from the voting process,\u201d said Mike Masserman, head of social impact at Lyft, in an email.\n\nMotivate, which operates most of the bike share programs in the U.S., is offering free day passes to ride bikes on Election Day in nine of its markets for the first time.

He wanted to take his own life and only his life,\u201d attorney Amy Gallicchio said of Akayed Ullah, 28, of Brooklyn. \u201cThis is not a suicide bombing. This is not a terrorist attack.\u201d\n\nGallicchio spoke after Assistant U.S. Attorney George Turner said Ullah sought \u201cto inflict maximum damage, to terrorize Americans.\u201d\n\nTurner said Ullah purposely chose morning rush hour last Dec. 11 in the city\u2019s busiest subway station to maximize casualties.\n\nThe failed pipe bombing occurred in a pathway linking the subway to the Port Authority bus terminal in Manhattan. The subway is beneath the busy Times Square area where many trains are linked.\n\nThe bomb fizzled, burning Ullah but sparing nearby pedestrians from life-threatening injuries.\n\nThe prosecutor said Ullah followed the propaganda of the Islamic State group online and wanted to follow its instructions to carry out a \u201clone wolf\u201d terror attack on Americans.\n\n\u201cHis goal was to injure and kill innocent civilians, to terrorize,\u201d Turner said.\n\nThe prosecutor said Ullah told an investigator after his arrest: \u201cI did it for the Islamic State.\u201d\n\nAuthorities say Ullah\u2019s radicalization began in 2014 when he started viewing materials online.\n\nGallicchio agreed Ullah opposed the U.S. government\u2019s policies toward Muslims and the Middle East. But she said he did not try to set off his pipe bomb when he was on crowded subway cars with hundreds of people.\n\nInstead, she said, he waited until he was in a largely isolated corridor, where it was caught on a security video stream that was shown to jurors.\n\n\u201cIt was a disturbing act by a disturbed man,\u201d Gallicchio said. \u201cThis is not a lone-wolf attack.\u201d\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Shawn Crowley countered Gallicchio\u2019s argument by saying Ullah would not have chosen to use a bomb if he only intended to kill himself.\n\n\u201cIt was about martyrdom, not suicide,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis is not a close case. You know what happened. The defendant carried out a terrorist attack for ISIS,\u201d Crowley said, using the acronym the government sometimes uses to refer to the Islamic State group.\n\nIf convicted, Ullah could face life in prison.\n\nAuthorities have said Ullah taunted President Donald Trump on Facebook before the attack.

(AP) \u2014 The Standing Rock Sioux is challenging new government conclusions that the $3.8 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline poses no significant environmental threats to American Indian tribes in the Dakotas.\n\nThe Army Corps of Engineers in August finished more than a year of additional study ordered by a federal judge. The agency said the work substantiated its earlier determination that the chances of an oil spill are low, any impacts to tribal hunting and fishing will be limited and that the project does not pose a higher risk of adverse impacts to minority and low-income people.\n\nThe Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which is leading a four-tribe lawsuit against the four-state pipeline built by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, in court documents filed Thursday asked a federal judge to reject the findings.\n\n\u201cThe corps has conducted a sham process to arrive at a sham conclusion, for the second time,\u201d tribal Chairman Mike Faith said in a statement.\n\nThe pipeline has the capacity to move half of the oil produced daily in North Dakota, the nation\u2019s second-leading producer behind Texas. It passes just north of the Standing Rock Reservation, beneath a Missouri River reservoir that is the tribe\u2019s water source.\n\nThe pipeline has been moving North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois since June 2017. That same month, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled that the Corps largely complied with environmental law when permitting the pipeline but needed to do more study of its impact to tribal rights. The Corps filed its work with the court in late August.\n\nStanding Rock\u2019s challenge says the Corps \u201cfailed to grapple with extensive technical input provided by the tribe and others undermining its conclusions.\u201d The major example the tribe offered is information it says shows the Corps has underestimated the risk and impact of an oil spill.\n\nThe tribe continues to maintain that the only lawful way to resolve the matter would be through a full environmental study that includes consideration of route alternatives.\n\nThe Corps had planned to do a more extensive environmental study before President Donald Trump took office in January 2017 and pushed through completion of the stalled project. The agency said in court documents in August that the additional study concluded a more thorough review is unwarranted. The tribe asks Boasberg to reject that conclusion.\n\n___\n\nFollow Blake Nicholson on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/NicholsonBlake", "Sandy St. Dennis drops her ballot at a drop box outside of Olympia City Hall in Olympia, Wash., Monday, Nov. 5, 2018.

Many counties do daily updates after that, but because of the number of steps involved in ballot verification, including sorting, signature verification and assessment of ballots for extraneous marks, the updates can feel painfully slow.\n\nIn California voters also have the option of balloting by mail. Those ballots too must be postmarked by Election Day and received no later than three days later. In past elections, some close California races have not been called for days.\n\nHOW MANY STATES VOTE BY MAIL? According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 37 states and the District of Columbia offer some type of early voting, and 27 states and D.C. offer \u201cno-excuse\u201d absentee voting. While more than 20 states allow certain elections to be held by mail, only Washington, Oregon and Colorado conduct all elections exclusively by mail.\n\nColorado and Oregon both require that ballots, whether they are mailed or dropped off, be received by elections officials no later than Election Day. In Washington state, ballots just need to be postmarked by Election Day.\n\nWHAT DO SUPPORTERS OF VOTE-BY-MAIL SAY? Former secretaries of state, Phil Keisling of Oregon and Sam Reed of Washington, co-wrote an op-ed in the New York Times in September lauding what they call \u201cvote-at-home\u201d laws that they credit for higher turnout in those states. More than 80 percent of voters in Oregon and Washington returned their ballots in the 2016 general election; the national turnout rate was about 61 percent.\n\n\u201cVote-at-home\u2019s power derives from it being an opt-out rather than an opt-in election system,\u201d they wrote. \u201cElection Day realities for other voters \u2014 bad weather or traffic jams, work schedules and family obligations \u2014 don\u2019t thwart our voters in exercising their most fundamental of rights.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "It\u2019s now up to Idaho voters to chart the state\u2019s course\n\nFILE - This March 5, 2015 file photo shows video gaming terminals known as instant horse racing at Les Bois Park in Garden City, Idaho. Such machines are now banned in Idaho, but a new ballot initiative, Proposition 1, has been filed to legalize the machines. (AP Photo/Otto Kitsinger, File)\n\nBOISE, Idaho (AP) \u2014 Millions of dollars have been raised, candidates have traveled to every corner of the state, and Idaho residents have been contacted via mail advertisements, texts and phone calls. Now it\u2019s all up to the voters to decide who will lead Idaho and what they\u2019ll be expected to do.\n\nThe stakes, as always, are high: Idaho voters will elect a new governor, decide who will be their U.S. representatives and make decisions on a pair of initiatives about expanding Medicaid and gambling.\n\nA ballot initiative called Proposition 1 seeking to legalize historical horse racing devices that opponents say are the equivalent of illegal slot machines has drawn millions of dollars both for and against the measure ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nProposition 2 would expand Medicaid to an estimated 62,000 working Idaho residents believed to be in a gap population that earns too much to qualify for Medicaid and too little to qualify for insurance subsidies. It got a late boost last week when Idaho Gov. C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter announced his endorsement in television ads.\n\nIn the race to replace Otter, Democrat Paulette Jordan is vying to become the first woman and first Native American governor. She faces a tough challenge in Lt. Gov. Brad Little, a southwestern Idaho rancher.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what\u2019s on the ballot:\n\n___\n\nPROP 1\n\nAn initiative seeking to legalize historical horse race betting devices that opponents say are slot machines in disguise is in the home stretch in what could be a close race.\n\nThe initiative, if passed, would allow historical horse racing machines at places that have a minimum of eight days of live horse racing. Backers, who have spent more than $3 million in advertising, say the machines will save live horse racing in the state.\n\nOpponents say the devices are the equivalent of slot machines.\n\nMore than $3 million has been spent to defeat the measure, mainly by the Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe, which has a casino in Worley with slot machines that could face competition.\n\n___\n\nPROP 2\n\nThis initiative, if passed, would expand Medicaid to an estimated 62,000 working Idahoans believed to be in a gap population that earns too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to qualify for insurance subsidies.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the U.S. government pays at least 90 percent of the cost of expanding Medicaid while states pick up the rest. Backers say the initiative would save Idaho $400 million in the first year. Otter gave the initiative his backing last week.\n\nThe primary argument against expansion has been that accepting federal dollars only comes with regulatory burdens that do not help lower the growing costs of medical care.\n\n___\n\nGOVERNOR\n\nRepublican Lt. Gov. Brad Little, a rancher who has been in elected office for the past 16 years, is trying to defeat Democrat Paulette Jordan, a former lawmaker and member of the Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribal Council who if elected would become the first woman and first Native American governor of the state. Both seek to replace Otter, who has served three-consecutive four-year terms as the state\u2019s chief executive.\n\nLittle is a longtime Republican lawmaker who has served as lieutenant governor since 2009. Little has said that his priorities for the office will be ensuring that Idaho residents have access to good jobs, a good education system, affordable health care and that he will work to \u201cprotect our quality of life.\u201d Little says expanding Medicaid is not his first choice, but if voters approve Proposition 2 he\u2019ll work with lawmakers to implement it.\n\nJordan said state leaders have failed to adequately fund public education and that she would increase public school funding by saving elsewhere, particularly by stopping out-of-state prison spending and by expanding Medicaid, which she said would save $400 million in the first year.\n\n___\n\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR\n\nDemocrat Kristin Collum, an Army veteran and software engineer who describes herself as a moderate willing to collaborate with both sides for \u201cTeam Idaho,\u201d is facing former state Rep.

Swisher said he supports the Affordable Care Act and a single-payer health care system.\n\nOn climate change, Swisher said he\u2019s in favor of solar and wind energy while also using a carbon tax to cut back on carbon-based fuels.

The student\u2019s documentary focuses on his experiences making short movies and discovering his voice as an artist over the last 10 years.\n\nO\u2019Connor said he began making films when he was 6 or 7 years old using a home video camera.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a very visual thinker, so (filmmaking) was a really good way to express my thoughts when I was younger,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cI lived in a very fantastical world when I was younger. I thought that my toys could live. I would stare, for hours, at them waiting for them to talk like \u2018Toy Story.\u2019 For film, I realized I could make those fantasies become a reality.\u201d\n\nThat is when O\u2019Connor said he began working with stop-motion animation styles using Lego brick figures and miniature cars. With his camcorder, O\u2019Connor filmed clips and edited them to create short movies on a laptop or an iPad. As he got older and became a fan of blockbuster superhero movies, O\u2019Connor said he wanted to delve into the world of action films.\n\n\u201cI started getting into that more and doing live action with my siblings and my friends,\u201d said O\u2019Connor, who wants to establish a career in the filmmaking industry. \u201cThe majority of it was mostly action, spies, whatever.\u201d\n\nIn middle school, O\u2019Connor experimented with several film varieties, including drama, horror and comedy.\n\n\u201cWhenever inspiration would strike and I thought it would be a cool idea, we\u2019d get together on a weekend or something and just make it happen,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cI\u2019d spend the next week or so just editing that and I\u2019d show it to family, friends, friend\u2019s families.

O\u2019Connor said his parents encouraged him to send in his film.

The rangers told him it was illegal to operate the noisy craft that can navigate shallow water or even mud. He sued in 2011.\n\nThe issue is whether a federal law enacted in 1980 to protect undisturbed land but also allow Alaska residents to maintain their way of life provides an exception to Park Service regulation of rivers that pass through national parks.\n\n\u201cWell, but, I mean, the waters are very important to Alaskans\u2019 way of life in the way they aren\u2019t elsewhere,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts said, voicing doubt about the Trump administration\u2019s reading of the law that gives the federal government sweeping control of the waterways.\n\nJustice Department lawyer Edwin Kneedler told the court that the 1980 law is a compromise because it allows hunting and airplane use in areas that usually are closed to those activities in national parks in other states.\n\nBut Congress did not intend to allow hovercraft to be used, Kneedler said, calling them very loud and unsightly.\n\nRoberts didn\u2019t sound persuaded by that argument. \u201cWhile you may think a hovercraft is unsightly, I mean, if you\u2019re trying to get from point A to point B, it\u2019s pretty beautiful,\u201d he said.\n\nThat comment aligned with the argument made by Alaska assistant attorney general Ruth Botstein, who said the law protected the state\u2019s control over rivers. \u201cOur rivers are our only roads,\u201d Botstein said.\n\nThe session Monday also displayed the difficulty the justices were having in reconciling the precise language of the 1980 law with arguments on both sides.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve burned up an awful lot of gray cells trying to put together the pieces of this statute,\u201d said Justice Samuel Alito.", "Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim, right, talks with official Pat Driscoll during the second half of the team's college basketball exhibition game against Le Moyne in Syracuse, N.Y., Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2018. (AP Photo/Nick Lisi)\n\nSyracuse coach Jim Boeheim is dealing with a little uncertainty as his No. 16 Orange head into their season opener.\n\nInjuries to the team\u2019s three point guards \u2014 starter Frank Howard and backups Howard Washington and Jalen Carey \u2014 forced Boeheim to use shooting guard Tyus Battle at the point in the team\u2019s two exhibition games, against Saint Rose and Le Moyne. The Orange, who easily beat both Division II teams, open the season Tuesday night at home against Eastern Washington.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t know anything until probably right about game time,\u201d Boeheim said. \u201cAt least now we\u2019ve had two games ... with Tyus handling the ball and doing stuff. That\u2019s good for us. We\u2019ll see who\u2019s ready.\u201d\n\nSyracuse defeated crosstown rival Le Moyne last Wednesday, getting a team-high 21 points from East Carolina transfer Elijah Hughes. Battle finished with 13 points, five assists and zero turnovers as four players scored in double figures in the 89-52 victory.\n\nThe Orange defeated Saint Rose 77-45 in their exhibition opener on Oct. 25, when Hughes and Boeheim\u2019s son, Buddy, each scored 19. Battle had only seven points on 1-for-10 shooting and assisted on six baskets with two turnovers.\n\n\u201cThese games hurt us a little bit because we\u2019re playing out of position, so I think it has a little less value from that standpoint,\u201d Boeheim said. \u201cTyus is much better when he is off the ball and can make his plays. When he\u2019s doing the point, it\u2019s just not the same.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to make that switch. He\u2019s always been a scoring guard. When he gets his opportunities, he\u2019s got to get to the basket.\u201d\n\nHoward is nursing an ankle injury and is out of the walking boot he was wearing in mid-October, but he\u2019s doubtful for the opener. Carey is recovering from a sprained ankle he suffered in the Orange\u2019s camp-opening scrimmage just over two weeks ago, while Washington is close to returning from surgery on torn ligaments in his right knee, which he suffered during practice last January.\n\nThe season-ending injury to Washington came after the best game of his freshman season \u2014 nine points and three rebounds in a double overtime loss at No. 23 Florida State. Both Washington and Carey have taken part in recent practices.\n\nEastern Washington, picked to finish fourth in the Big Sky Conference, returns four starters from last year\u2019s team, which finished 20-15. The departure of the conference\u2019s all-time leading scorer, Bogdan Bliznyuk, who was the league MVP, leaves a big void. He finished his career with 2,169 points.\n\nAs for the Orange, the staff expects big things right from the opening tip.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a good state of mind,\u201d assistant coach Gerry McNamara said. \u201cWe have the right pieces. We\u2019re as deep as we\u2019ve been in a long time. We\u2019re in a good position. We just have to make sure that we come together and play selflessly.

(AP) \u2014 Think of Todd Gieg as a master of the miniature \u2014 a man who uses old maps and photographs, special paints and infinite patience to recreate the Lynn of 1895, down to the detail of faux ivy crawling up the sides of buildings and painstakingly-recreated signs.\n\nA photographer by trade, Gieg dreamed up the diorama project that has become his passion and pursuit in 2004 shortly after moving to Lynn with his wife, Amy Bertino, and their son, Max.\n\nLanky and quick with a smile, Gieg is a self-described collector of all things unusual who has filled his Lydia Pinkham building shop with oddities like the giant metal letters from a Boston sign and a Rube Goldberg-like device once used to wash fashionable hats.\n\nBuying a basic model railroad kit for his son when Max was a boy prompted Gieg to dig into the history of the former narrow gauge railroads that crisscrossed the region and carried freight and passengers along Lynn and Revere\u2019s waterfront.\n\n\u201cI said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I build a railroad that actually existed?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe started attending miniature model shows and learned about the detailed, ultra-realistic models crafted by George Sellios who excels in replicating late-19th and early-20th century streetscapes, railroad sidings and other settings.\n\nGieg dug into the Lynn Museum\u2019s photography collection and pored over old city maps to begin to layout his Lynn of yesteryear on a 4-foot-by-16-foot surface spanning four custom-built tables.\n\nAs his research piled up and his modeling skills improved, he began to sketch in detail ideas and designs for his diorama. The more than 50 models he built for the diorama over the years ranging from small boats and coal barges to a \u201cgasometer\u201d storage tank and rows of buildings lining Market Street are intricate in their detail and precise, Gieg insists, in their historically-accurate placement based on maps and plot plans.\n\nLong before the Lynnway existed, the railroad and a long-gone byway called Sea Street paralleled the 1890s Lynn waterfront. Working boats plied narrow inlets where mills and coal terminals operated next to docks for sailing ships.\n\nDirt paths and roads snaked along the waterfront and Market Street was lined with buildings topped by signs advertising \u201cJ.P. Coats Six Cord\u201d and \u201cRedpaths.\u201d\n\nMany of the diorama\u2019s structures, ships and trains are assembled from modeling kits, but Gieg \u201cscratch built\u201d almost a third of the diorama\u2019s buildings, relying on photographs and jury-rigged materials to replicate 120-year-old homes and shops.\n\n\u201cI have been successful at this because it is pleasurable. It\u2019s a real stay-in-the-moment experience,\u201d he said.\n\nHe used special paints and resins to experiment with coloring and texture until he was satisfied he had created realistic-looking water. Jars marked with granular mixtures and labeled \u201cfine turf green\u201d and \u201ccoarse turf\u201d provide him with the material he needs to recreate grass.\n\nHis Lynn waterfront is just the first chapter in a project that he said will bring to life on a small scale the 1895 coastline north of Boston from Lynn to East Boston.\n\nHe started a Kickstarter campaign under the title \u201cThe Narrow Gauge: Boston\u2019s Forgotten Railroad,\u201d with the goal of raising $75,000 to pay for materials and meet other costs as he expands the diorama.\n\nLynn Museum/Lynn Arts Director Drew Russo has spoken with Gieg about exhibiting the Lynn diorama in the Union and Washington streets museum.\n\n\u201cHe has generously offered to loan us the diorama for an extended period of time and we are currently working with him on how to best display it,\u201d Russo said.\n\nGieg envisions the diorama as teaching tool alternately fascinating adults and children alike and educating them about a time and an all-but-lost way of life.\n\n\u201cI want it shared,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2SQY9hR\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The (Lynn, Mass.)

(AP) \u2014 The battle for Georgia governor intensified in its final hours Monday as Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp framed it as a stark choice for this growing and diversifying state, and prepared for another month of campaigning if no one wins a majority Tuesday.\n\nAt her first campaign stop in Savannah, Abrams slammed Kemp as a \u201cbald-faced liar\u201d who abused his powers as the sitting secretary of state when he suggested over the weekend, without offering evidence, that the Georgia Democratic Party tampered with the state\u2019s online voter database.\n\nKemp also made a last-day campaign stop at a private airport terminal in Savannah, where he insisted there was reason to suspect a hacking attempt, but declined to give details.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the specifics of the investigation,\u201d Kemp told reporters. \u201cBut I can tell you I would not be calling Homeland Security, the FBI and the GBI unless we had information that we needed them to look at.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Kemp told supporters at a suburban Atlanta airplane hangar, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a time where the state of Georgia had more at stake than we do in this contest.\u201d\n\nAlready a historic matchup, with Abrams trying to become the first black woman elected governor in U.S. history, it has morphed in recent weeks from a battle of clear ideological differences into a racially charged argument over ballot access and voter fraud. A last-minute fracas about Georgia\u2019s voting system raised the specter of a disputed result.\n\nBoth candidates are seeking to cobble together enough votes to win outright on Tuesday. If neither Kemp nor Abrams wins a majority \u2014 a distinct possibility with a Libertarian candidate on the ballot \u2014 there could be another month of campaigning.\n\nMore than 2 million Georgians have cast early ballots. That\u2019s about 80 percent of the total votes cast four years ago. There are almost 7 million registered voters in the state.\n\nKemp, a 54-year-old businessman who has been secretary of state since 2010, has embraced President Donald Trump as he tries to extend GOP dominance in a state that hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat to its top job since 1998. Trump visited Georgia on Sunday for a mega rally in conservative central Georgia. Kemp stormed to the GOP nomination with ads featuring everything from the candidate cranking a chain saw and jokingly pointing a gun toward a teen boy suitor of his daughter to Kemp\u2019s offer to \u201cround up criminal illegals\u201d himself in his pickup truck\n\nAbrams, a 44-year-old Yale Law graduate and former state legislative leader, has run as an unapologetic liberal as she looks to establish Georgia as a legitimate two-party battleground ahead of the 2020 presidential campaign. She touts her work with Republican state lawmakers but pledges to expand Medicaid insurance and prioritize public funding of education.\n\nShe also backs tighter gun restrictions and supports removing Confederate monuments from state property. Abrams cruised to the Democratic nomination after encountering initial resistance from old-guard Georgia Democrats who backed her white opponent, in part out of concerns that a black woman could not win in November. Since then, she\u2019s been a fundraising juggernaut, raising millions from beyond Georgia, and she\u2019s drawn a parade of notable supporters, most recently former President Barack Obama and media icon Oprah Winfrey.\n\nAbrams and voting rights advocates have accused Kemp of using his office to make it harder for certain voters, particularly minorities, to vote. Kemp counters that Abrams and affiliated groups are trying to help people, including noncitizens, vote illegally.\n\nThose tensions exploded in the home stretch after a private citizen raised concerns that the voter database Kemp is responsible for as secretary of state is hackable, meaning a bad actor could potentially alter or delete a voter\u2019s information in the files used to check-in voters at polling places. The citizen made his findings available late last week to the state Democratic Party and to an attorney who flagged the concern to the FBI and to Kemp\u2019s office. Before any of that became public, Kemp\u2019s state office declared Sunday that it was investigating Georgia Democrats.\n\nKemp acknowledged to reporters Monday \u201ca potential vulnerability that we found out about\u201d but insisted the state\u2019s election systems are secure. When pressed about the optics of using his office to investigate his opposition days before an election, Kemp said he \u201cwasn\u2019t worried about how it looks,\u201d adding \u201cthis is how we would handle any investigation.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Abrams alluded to years of court fights with Kemp over voter registration rules. Democrats also have blasted Kemp over 53,000 voter registrations that his office flagged as pending ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election. Those voters will be able to vote, he says, as long as they show proper identification like every other voter. Kemp says he\u2019s following federal and state election law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got an opponent who not only is an architect of voter suppression, but he\u2019s a bald-faced liar,\u201d Abrams told more than 200 people at a union hall for longshoremen who work at Savannah\u2019s port. \u201cI don\u2019t use that term lightly. ...But when he was told on Friday that he had once again failed in his job, instead of fixing the problem he blamed the Democratic Party of Georgia. He made up a story like a 6-year-old trying to cover his tracks.\u201d\n\nAbrams acknowledges the historic nature of her candidacy. But, she said she doesn\u2019t want that to drive the outcome.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to vote for me because I\u2019m black,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd no one on the ballot needs a vote because we\u2019re women. And I don\u2019t even want you to vote for us just because we\u2019re Democrats. You need to vote for us because we\u2019re better.\u201d\n\n-----\n\nNadler reported from Chamblee, Georgia.

Davis, who owned stock in more than 80 public companies and liked to make a show of her presence at shareholder meetings, died Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018. She was 89. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The brash shareholder activist Evelyn Y. Davis, who owned stock in more than 80 public companies and rarely failed to make her presence known at corporate-investor meetings, has died. She was 89.\n\nFor decades, Davis was notorious among executives at blue-chip companies for raising a ruckus at annual meetings, sometimes turning the typically staid affairs into yelling matches.\n\nSimultaneously confrontational and flirty, she would demand that a CEO resign, while letting on that she found the executive to be attractive.\n\nDavis relished attention, good or bad.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other woman like me!\u201d she would say. \u201cThere\u2019s no other shareholder like me!\u201d\n\nDavis died Sunday in Washington.\n\nEvelyn Yvonne De Jong was born to a wealthy family in Amsterdam in 1929, two months before the stock market crash pitched the globe into the Great Depression.\n\nWhen World War II swept over Europe, Davis and some members of her immediate family, which had Jewish roots, were interned at a concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, a detail confirmed by the International Tracing Service, a respected archive of Holocaust-era documents.\n\nDavis moved to the Baltimore area after the war with her neurologist father, finished her education, and began investing in the 1950s.\n\nIn a biography filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission when she sat on a panel about shareholder rights, she described herself as \u201ca four times Divorcee with NO children.\u201d\n\nStocks, she liked to say, were her children.\n\nAnd it seemed she would do anything to advocate and raise attention for what she believed to be the safest path for her investments. She wore a bathing suit to the General Motors meeting in 1970, donned hot pants for another company\u2019s meeting and put on a bandolier for a third.\n\nAt United Aircraft, she nominated baseball star Hank Aaron to the board. It was 1974, just after Aaron beat Babe Ruth\u2019s home run record.\n\nAs Davis got older, her outfits became less outlandish. She favored expensive suits, always showing up perfectly coiffed. But there was no polishing or toning down her candor. She\u2019d interrupt other shareholders, speak over CEOs, and race to the microphone when the floor was opened for comments so that it was her voice that was heard first.\n\nAt a Home Depot meeting in 2007, she heckled then-CEO Frank Blake. \u201cYou\u2019re a phony, Frank!\u201d she yelled. At Bank of America in 2010, she told CEO Brian Moynihan that he looked like her handsome first ex-husband (three more were to follow). The next year, she chewed out Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein for the regulatory fines that the bank had racked up. She told Blankfein, however, that it wasn\u2019t personal ... that he wasn\u2019t so bad-looking.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s manipulating the male ego,\u201d Davis said later. \u201cI\u2019m very good at that.\u201d\n\nHer bravado paid off occasionally, and after extended campaigns. In 2005, Macy\u2019s mandated that board members stand for re-election every year instead of every three years.\n\nThat had been a 17-year goal for Davis.\n\nDavis consistently ensured her proximity to power. She got herself press credentials to cover White House briefings. When she bought a Jaguar, it was personally delivered by Bill Ford, the great-grandson of the company founder, and also an executive.\n\nShe pushed her annual newsletter, \u201cHighlights and Lowlights,\u201d onto the same CEOs she harangued, charging $600 a copy. She insisted that each executive buy two of them.\n\nShe liked to introduce herself as queen of the corporate jungle, and issue press releases about the latest proposals, and latest divorces, of \u201cEvelyn Y. Davis, Famous Shareholder Activist.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, when she was 82, Davis failed to attend a single shareholder meeting. And for the first time since 1965, she didn\u2019t publish \u201cHighlights and Lowlights.\u201d\n\nContacted by The Associated Press that year, Davis explained, \u201cI\u2019m not so young anymore.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, in ensuing interviews with the AP, she wanted to be described as \u201ca woman of mystery and intrigue,\u201d and asked how dull shareholders meetings had become without her in attendance.\n\nThe inscription on a tombstone that Davis commissioned years ago reads: \u201cPower is greater than love, and I did not get where I am by standing in line, nor by being shy.\u201d", "RUPERT, Idaho (AP) \u2014 A southern Idaho school district has given all teachers and building administrators two-way radios and emergency response backpacks to use in a crisis.\n\nThe Times-News reports Minidoka County School District improvement director Michele Widmier says the district purchased 300 of the backpacks and 240 radios at a cost of just over $20,000.\n\nThe radios are programmed to contact police and fire departments directly, without dialing.

There also are two ballot issues.\n\nAfter 10 days of early voting, Election Day polls open Tuesday at 6:30 a.m. and close at 7:30 p.m.\n\nHere is a look at some voting numbers and key races on the ballot:\n\nEARLY VOTING\n\nAccording to figures released Monday by the secretary of state\u2019s office, more than 174,000 residents voted early, a record for a midterm election since early voting was first allowed in 2002. That compares to more than 97,000 early votes in the last midterm general election in 2014 and a record 210,000 in the 2016 general election.\n\nThere are about 1.24 million registered voters in the state, down about 33,000 from the 2016 general election.\n\nRegistered Democrats comprise nearly 42 percent of the electorate. Registered Republicans make up about 32 percent of all voters and 22 percent had no party affiliation.\n\nU.S. SENATE\n\nDemocrat Joe Manchin, a former governor, is seeking a second full six-year term in the Senate. He first took office after a 2010 special election prompted by the death of U.S. Sen. Robert C. Byrd.\n\nManchin, running in a state Republican President Donald Trump won by 42 percentage points in 2016, faces a challenge from Republican Patrick Morrisey, the two-term state attorney general. Also on the ballot is Libertarian Rusty Hollen.\n\nU.S. HOUSE\n\nThe 3rd District seat vacated by Jenkins pits Democratic state Sen. Richard Ojeda against Republican state delegate Carol Miller.\n\nCongressmen David McKinley from the 1st District faces Democrat Kendra Fershee, a West Virginia University law professor. Congressman Alex Mooney from the 2nd District goes up against Democrat Talley Sergent, a former Hillary Clinton state presidential campaign director.\n\nSTATE SUPREME COURT\n\nTen candidates are running in each of two races for unexpired terms on the state Supreme Court. The vacancies occurred after the retirements of justices Menis Ketchum and Robin Davis amid an impeachment scandal.\n\nRepublican former state House of Delegates speaker Tim Armstead and GOP Congressman Evan Jenkins, picked as temporary replacements by Republican Gov. Jim Justice, are also on the ballot. Armstead is running for Ketchum\u2019s unexpired term, which runs through 2020. Jenkins is seeking Davis\u2019 unexpired term, which runs through 2024.\n\nBALLOT ISSUES\n\nVoters will decide on separate constitutional ballot measures that would allow lawmakers to restrict or ban tax-payer funded abortions and have some control over the state judiciary\u2019s budget.\n\nEarlier this year, the Legislature approved a resolution that says: \u201cNothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of an abortion.\u201d It would authorize lawmakers to restrict or outlaw state funding for Medicaid abortions. Abortions would remain legal under federal law.\n\nOpponents say it would put the issue in the hands of the Legislature, which could ban Medicaid-funded abortions in cases of rape, incest or when a woman or girl\u2019s health is at risk.\n\nThe judiciary budget question would allow the Legislature to decide each year whether to reduce the state courts\u2019 budget, but not less than 85 percent of the previous year\u2019s budget. It also would require the Supreme Court\u2019s chief justice to answer budget questions before lawmakers.\n\nOpponents have said the measure would infringe on the courts\u2019 independence. The ballot question was approved amid questions about the Supreme Court\u2019s spending practices, including lavish renovations to individual justices\u2019 offices.\n\nLEGISLATURE\n\nHalf of the 34 state Senate seats and all 100 House of Delegates seats are up for grabs.

Another Fox News host, Jeanine Pirro, also appeared onstage with the president.\n\n\u201cBy the way, all those people in the back are fake news,\u201d Hannity told the audience.\n\nIt was an extraordinary scene after the news network had worked Monday to establish distance between Hannity and the campaign. Trump\u2019s campaign had billed Hannity as a \u201cspecial guest\u201d at the rally, but Fox had said that wasn\u2019t so. Hannity himself had tweeted: \u201cTo be clear, I will not be on stage campaigning with the president. I am covering final rally for the show.\u201d\n\nBut Trump called him to the stage after saying, \u201cthey\u2019re very special, they\u2019ve done an incredible job for us. They\u2019ve been with us from the beginning.\u201d\n\nHannity hugged the president when he came onstage and, after echoing Trump\u2019s traditional epithets about the media, recited some economic statistics.\n\nA Fox News spokeswoman did not immediate return a message seeking comment.\n\n\u201cEither Fox News lied all day about their direct collaboration with the Trump campaign, or the network simply doesn\u2019t have any control over Sean Hannity,\u201d said Angelo Carusone, president of the liberal media watchdog Media Matters for America, which has urged an advertiser boycott of Hannity in the past. \u201cThis is a problem. It\u2019s dangerous for democracy and a threat to a free press.\u201d\n\nHannity has been rebuked by Fox in the past. In 2016, he was part of a Trump political video, which Fox said it had not known about in advance and told Hannity not to do so again. When Fox found out in 2010 that the Tea Party had advertised that Hannity would be appearing at one of his fundraising rallies, Fox said it had not approved the arrangement and ordered him back to New York.\n\nMonday\u2019s rally appearance was not shown on Fox News Channel, but was aired on C-SPAN.\n\nIt came after Hannity\u2019s prime-time show aired from the rally site. He played the role of cheerleader from the side as the crowd waited for Trump\u2019s appearance. He pleaded with viewers to vote Republican on Tuesday to support Trump, and his opening monologue echoed a campaign slogan seen on signs at the arena: \u201cPromises made, promises kept.\u201d\n\nHe moved backstage, and with six minutes before the end of his show, Trump appeared for a billed interview that was largely bereft of questions. Trump told Hannity he had seen the beginning of his show.\n\n\u201cI never miss your opening monologue,\u201d he said.\n\nHannity\u2019s role at the rally had been put in question by Trump campaign itself. It announced on Sunday that Hannity was to be a guest, along with radio commentator Rush Limbaugh and singer Lee Greenwood. Fox said it did not know how that impression had been created and Michael Glassner, chief operating officer for the campaign, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDespite Fox\u2019s disavowal, the Trump campaign continued to list Hannity as a guest throughout Monday at the link where people could seek tickets to the event.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lou Kesten in Washington contributed to this report.", "PROVIDENCE, R.I.

She often talks about the number of jobs that have been created in Rhode Island and the declining unemployment rate since she took office.\n\nFung and Trillo accuse Raimondo of taking too much credit for the state\u2019s improving economy. Fung is promising to lower the sales tax and slash business fees and taxes.\n\nFung said Raimondo is an insider whose leadership has failed. He\u2019s highlighting the disastrous rollout of a public benefits computer system. Raimondo has gone after Fung, the mayor of Cranston, for what she called \u201cpublic corruption\u201d in his police department. Both Raimondo and Trillo have brought up Fung\u2019s police department and a 2015 Rhode Island State Police report that found Fung was among those responsible for deep dysfunction there.\n\nTrillo left the Republican Party to run as an independent, but has still earned the support of some high-profile Republicans.

Cicilline, who\u2019s seeking a fifth term, faces Republican Patrick Donovan, who describes himself as an \u201cenvironmental Republican.\u201d Donovan wants to change the way prescription drugs are disposed of, both to protect the environment and prevent misuse.\n\nBALLOT QUESTIONS\n\nThe first statewide ballot question Tuesday asks voters\u2019 permission to spend $250 million over five years to help municipalities build new schools and renovate existing facilities as part of a 10-year plan.\n\nIf approved, the state money, combined with municipal spending, is expected to eventually total more than $2 billion. Voters would be asked to approve another $250 million in 2022. Raimondo has championed it, asking for a \u201conce-in-a-generation investment\u201d to fix schools after years of neglect.\n\nThere\u2019s no major concerted opposition to the question, but some have questioned whether all school districts would benefit.\n\nVoters are also being asked to authorize $70 million on higher education facilities and $47.3 million for environmental and recreational projects, in the other two statewide ballot questions.\n\nLOCAL RACES\n\nOne of Rhode Island\u2019s most powerful politicians, Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, is up for re-election in his Cranston district against a Republican rival that came close to beating him in 2016.\n\nMattiello faces Republican Steven Frias, who lost by 85 votes in 2016. The Rhode Island chapter of the National Organization for Women and the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence are trying to get Cranston residents to vote Mattiello out because they don\u2019t feel he addressed issues important to them.

In the end, Bellarabi received a four-week suspension.\n\nThe 28-year-old Bellarabi made his comeback as a late substitute against Hannover and he salvaged a 2-2 draw with the equalizer in the fourth minute of injury time. He then scored two goals in the 3-2 loss at FC Zurich in the Europa League before his superb performances in Bremen and Moenchengladbach.\n\nThe latest results ease the pressure on Leverkusen coach Heiko Herrlich after a lackluster start to the season. Herrlich played his part in getting the best back from Bellarabi, who collapsed due to the heat in a pre-season friendly and hadn\u2019t made an impact once the season began.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of talks. There are things that I also demanded of him last year that he\u2019s putting into place now,\u201d Herrlich said. \u201cI hope his run lasts a bit longer.\u201d\n\nBellarabi\u2019s return - and his return to form - appears to have lifted teammates like Julian Brandt, Kai Havertz and Kevin Volland, too.

She also brought her own political pedigree to the race \u2014 as majority whip in the West Virginia House of Delegates and the daughter of the late U.S. Rep.

The teachers staged a nine-day walkout earlier this year and won a 5 percent pay increase. Their success ignited similar walkouts in other states.\n\nOjeda also took up the cause of medical marijuana, successfully sponsoring legislation to make it legal.\n\nHe offered a populist message that stressed health care and economic issues in a district reeling from the loss of coal jobs. He called for expanding the Affordable Care Act to include a public buy-in option to create more competitive markets.\n\nThe 3rd District seat was held by Republican Evan Jenkins, who lost his bid for the GOP nomination for the U.S. Senate.

(AP) \u2014 With open seats for governor and U.S. senator, Tennessee Democrats believe they have their best chance in years to gain ground in Tuesday\u2019s general election.\n\nThe votes of women could be key.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep Marsha Blackburn hopes to foil the Democrats\u2019 efforts and become the first female U.S. senator in Tennessee history. But Democratic former Gov. Phil Bredesen is hoping female voters turn the tide in his favor.\n\nPolling has shown women to be slow to embrace Blackburn, a stark gender divide during a time that\u2019s been described as the year of the female voter. Polls range from showing the race is still a tossup to Blackburn having a lead.\n\nThe seat came open when Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Bob Corker announced his retirement, with the 51-49 Republican majority hanging in balance. The competitiveness over the open seat has led to campaign spending records in Tennessee. A whopping $85 million has already been spent from the candidates and outside groups, by the closing days of the campaign.\n\nThe race became so high-profile that even pop superstar Taylor Swift, who got her career start in Nashville, broke her political silence by going on Instagram to endorse Bredesen and encourage people to vote.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican businessman Bill Lee and former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean are vying to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Bill Haslam.\n\nLee has enjoyed a comfortable lead in the polls for most of the campaign. However, Dean has amped up his criticism of Lee in the campaign\u2019s final days, calling the Republican candidate \u201cextreme\u201d and demanding more scrutiny of Lee\u2019s business contracting with state and local governments.\n\nPreviously both candidates had praised each other for delivering mostly positive messages during the campaign.\n\nThey differ chiefly on health care, with Dean in favor of expanding Tennessee\u2019s Medicaid eligibility and Lee opposing the idea.\n\nDean argues that Tennessee is leaving money on the table by choosing not to take the option offered under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the U.S. government pays at least 90 percent of the cost of expanding Medicaid while states pick up the rest. Despite the savings promoted by supporters, Tennessee lawmakers have long refused to consider Medicaid \u2014 known in Tennessee as TennCare \u2014 even with Republican Gov. Bill Haslam advocating for the change.\n\nLee says expanding access to health care and lowering medical costs could take up to 20 years but it shouldn\u2019t involve relying on federal funding.\n\nWith two high-profile races, voting has spiked in early and absentee ballots. As of Friday, nearly 1.38 million Tennesseans had already voted in the midterm election.\n\nMeanwhile, some advocacy groups claim they\u2019ve also seen multiple legal violations by election officials. Most recently, a judge ordered the Shelby County Election Commission to allow people with incomplete voter registration applications to fix any problems and vote on Election Day. But the Court of Appeals in Tennessee then blocked most of the injunction, ruling that those who fix incomplete applications on Election Day will have to cast provisional ballots.\n\nIn that same county, which has the state\u2019s largest black population, there were complaints that changing the font on the voting machines resulted in Dean\u2019s name appearing later on the ballot.\n\nSix of Tennessee\u2019s nine U.S. House races include incumbents who are expected to hold on to their seats, barring a major upset. Republicans currently hold seven of the state\u2019s congressional seats. Three GOP-held seats are open.\n\nFurthermore, all 99 seats in the state House and 18 of the 33 state Senate seats are being contested.

Back then the squad was still being constructed. Whereas now the project has reached the final phase \u2014 winning the Champions League.

With a squad featuring two of the world\u2019s top players in Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, the only cup missing for the big-spending Qatari owners remains the Champions League.\n\nHaving also coached Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich in recent seasons, Ancelotti raised some eyebrows when he returned to Italy for this season with Napoli, a club that hasn\u2019t won Serie A since Diego Maradona led the team to its only two titles in 1987 and 1990.\n\nWhile challenging eventual champion Juventus in Serie A last season, Napoli looked like a poor shadow of itself in Europe.\n\nLast season, Napoli finished third in its group behind Manchester City and Shakhtar Donetsk and was relegated to the Europa League.\n\nPrevious Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri openly discussed his preference for Serie A over the Europa League and the Partenopei were promptly eliminated from the second-tier competition by Leipzig.\n\nAncelotti has restored Napoli\u2019s pride in Europe, as evidenced by a 1-0 win over Liverpool and a 2-2 draw at PSG two weeks ago in a match that Napoli dominated.\n\n\u201cFacing the big clubs is never easy,\u201d Ancelotti said. \u201cIt was a bit easier in the first leg because we played well, and now we want to repeat that performance at the San Paolo stadium.\u201d\n\nLiverpool leads Group C with six points, followed by Napoli with five, PSG with four and Red Star Belgrade with one.\n\n\u201cDuring the draw we were considered the third force,\u201d Ancelotti said. \u201cNow we\u2019re in position to qualify.\u201d\n\nIn a match featuring an unusually high number of connections between former players and teammates, PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon will mark his Champions League return after a three-match ban in his native Italy against Ancelotti, who coached him at the beginning of his career at Parma.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a pleasure to see him and to see that he\u2019s motivated despite his age,\u201d Ancelotti said of the 40-year-old Buffon. \u201cI have great respect for him as a professional and great affection for him as a friend.\u201d\n\nPSG striker Edinson Cavani scored 104 goals for Napoli in all competitions between 2010 and 2013 \u2014 good for fourth on the club\u2019s all-time list \u2014 and is now PSG\u2019s all-time leading scorer with 176 goals.\n\nWhat\u2019s more is that Cavani\u2019s two sons still live in Napoli with his former wife \u2014 and the boys support Napoli.\n\nCavani has been nursing a slight muscle injury but is expected to play, amid reports that he is considering a return to Napoli for next season.\n\nAngel Di Maria, who scored PSG\u2019s late equalizer in the first meeting with Napoli, won the Champions League under Ancelotti at Real Madrid in 2014.\n\nPSG midfielder Marco Verratti was a teammate of Napoli striker Lorenzo Insigne when they won Serie B with Pescara in 2012 \u2014 a season in which Insigne scored 18 goals and created 14 assists.\n\nPromoted to more of a pure striker role under Ancelotti in a 4-4-2 formation, Insigne has thrived with nine goals in 13 matches in all competitions this season.\n\nSo has fellow striker Dries Mertens, who scored a hat trick in a 5-1 win over Empoli in Serie A on Friday.\n\nAncelotti had been using Mertens in a bench role.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that it\u2019s difficult to leave out a duo like Insigne-Mertens,\u201d Ancelotti said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nAndrew Dampf on Twitter: www.twitter.com/asdampf", "IDAHO FALLS, Idaho (AP) \u2014 A new U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs clinic is opening in eastern Idaho with the capacity to treat three times more patients than the region was previously able to care for.\n\nTim Huhtala, the regional head of primary care services for Veterans Affairs, told the Post Register that Idaho Falls had the largest demand for patients to get into VA care.

A loan deal was agreed with Monaco for Mbappe that became a 180 million euros ($205 million) purchase this year.\n\nUEFA opened an investigation soon after the Mbappe loan, and warned PSG in June this year to raise cash quickly from player sales to balance its 2017-18 accounts. UEFA also said some sponsor deals, including from Qatar, were overvalued.\n\nStill, investigators for UEFA\u2019s Club Financial Control Body closed their scrutiny of PSG\u2019s accounts for the year through June 2017 \u2014 before the Neymar signing.\n\nThe UEFA panel\u2019s judging chamber reviewed the decision and in September sent the case back for a \u201cdeeper investigation.\u201d It is that move which PSG is challenging at CAS.\n\nThe sports court\u2019s judges must first decide if it is admissible to appeal a procedural step rather than a final ruling.\n\nJoining PSG in a similar situation, Galatasaray was also placed under further investigation by the UEFA panel last month.

(AP Photo/Raymond Thompson)\n\nCHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 The toughest fight of Democrat Joe Manchin\u2019s three-plus decades in West Virginia politics comes down to whether he can retain his U.S. Senate seat in a state that was a stronghold for President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nManchin goes after a second full term in the Senate on Tuesday against comparative political newcomer Patrick Morrisey, the two-term Republican state attorney general hoping to ride plenty of attention from Trump in recent months to victory.\n\nMorrisey is trying to give West Virginia two Republican U.S. senators for the first time since 1958, when John D. Hoblitzell, Jr. was appointed to serve a year after the death of Democrat Matthew M. Neely. It would be the first time since 1929 the state has two elected GOP senators. Shelley Moore Capito\u2019s first term ends in 2020.\n\nA former governor, Manchin has worked hard to cozy up to Trump and nurture a bipartisan brand. He\u2019s portrayed himself as loyal to his home state rather than party ideology. Manchin was the only Senate Democrat to vote to confirm U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nMorrisey said Manchin lacked leadership on the nomination, calling him \u201cSideline Joe\u201d for waiting until the very end to announce his vote.\n\nThe 50-year-old Morrisey has labeled himself a true conservative while his campaign accused Manchin of being \u201ca dishonest Washington liberal who only acts bipartisan around election day ...\u201d\n\nMorrisey became a staunch supporter of Trump, who became popular in Appalachia for making broad promises to put coal miners back to work, despite grim economic forecasts for the industry. Trump won West Virginia by 42 percentage points in 2016 and visited the state three times this fall to rally for Morrisey.\n\nManchin has questioned Morrisey\u2019s past ties in Washington as a lobbyist for the pharmaceutical industry \u2014 West Virginia leads the nation in the rate of drug overdose deaths. Morrisey also tried to fend off criticism of his roots in New Jersey, where he lost a 2000 congressional race.\n\nManchin has hammered away at Morrisey for being involved in efforts to eliminate health insurance protections for people with pre-existing conditions. While Morrisey was among those involved in a federal lawsuit in Texas, he said he had no intention of eliminating those protections.\n\nThe 71-year-old Manchin earned the backing of teacher unions after he supported them during a statewide strike earlier this year. He also criticized Morrisey for calling the strike \u201cunlawful\u201d and for saying his office was prepared to support authorities with legal remedies.\n\nManchin, who won a special election in 2010 after the death of Sen. Robert C. Byrd and was elected again in 2012, has far outraised Morrisey. Manchin\u2019s campaign reported $9.2 million in his latest federal filing, compared to $5.4 million for Morrisey. Both candidates have saturated the airwaves in recent months with political ads.\n\nMorrisey also must deal with another disparity \u2014 42 percent of West Virginia voters are registered Democrats, compared to 32 percent registered Republicans. Yet West Virginia gave Trump his largest margin of victory and has trended hard toward the GOP in recent years. Morrisey was the lone Republican to hold statewide office after he was elected attorney general in 2012. The GOP now controls five of the six offices.\n\nThis election could be decided by the 22 percent of voters with no party affiliation and Morrisey has urged residents to head to the polls in bunches.\n\nDuring the last midterm election in West Virginia in 2014, just 37.4 percent of registered voters cast ballots \u2014 the lowest for a regular general election since the secretary of state\u2019s office started keeping such records in 1950.", "FILE - In this Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2018, file photograph, election judge Thomas Trujillo checks early ballots at the Denver Elections Division headquarters in Denver.

Thompson\u2019s attorneys countered that he was only defending himself after being punched in the face and insisted Thompson kept Hernandez subdued only until he stopped resisting.\n\nProsecutors said Thompson was quickly in control of Hernandez after the two got into a scuffle when Thompson saw Hernandez urinating outside a Denny\u2019s restaurant in Sheldon in May 2017.

They gave us more hope that justice would be done,\u201d said Ignacio Hernandez, John Hernandez\u2019s father.\n\nDuring closing arguments Friday, prosecutor John Jordan played cellphone video and 911 calls in which witnesses can be heard pleading for Thompson to let go of Hernandez and Hernandez can be heard gasping for air.\n\nJordan said that during the altercation, Hernandez signaled with his hand that he was no longer resisting but that Terry Thompson kept him in a chokehold for an additional three minutes and 36 seconds until Hernandez went limp.\n\n\u201cTerry Bryan Thompson did not kill John Hernandez because he had to. He killed him because he wanted to,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nCourtney, Thompson\u2019s attorney, portrayed Hernandez as the aggressor, saying he was drunk and belligerent and never stopped fighting Thompson until he passed out.\n\nThompson was only trying to have dinner with his kids when he was attacked by Hernandez and had no intention of killing him, Courtney said.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you.\u2019 He says, \u2018Stop!\u2019\u201d to Hernandez, Courtney said.\n\nHernandez died at a hospital three days after the confrontation. A medical examiner ruled he died of lack of oxygen to the brain caused by strangulation and chest compression.\n\nHernandez\u2019s family has remained critical of the investigation, saying deputies at the scene didn\u2019t interview potential witnesses and initially tried to have an assault charge filed against Hernandez.\n\nHernandez\u2019s family has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the Thompsons, asking for at least $1 million in damages. The lawsuit is pending.\n\nChauna Thompson, who was also charged with murder, is set for trial in April.\n\n___\n\nFor the latest details on this story: https://bit.ly/2RzFMwc\n\n___\n\nFollow Juan A.

Your questions are offensive a lot of times.\u201d\n\nThe ad has already likely been seen by more people than it would if it kept running. NBC aired it on the \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d game between the New England Patriots and Green Bay Packers, which drew the highest overnight ratings of the franchise\u2019s history. During football season, it\u2019s usually the most-watched show on television, often with around 20 million viewers.\n\nMSNBC also aired it on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Monday.\n\nReleased last week, the advertisement includes footage of Luis Bracamontes, a twice-deported immigrant from Mexico sentenced to death in California for killing two police officers. He\u2019s seen smiling in a court appearance and saying, \u201cI will break out soon and I will kill more.\u201d\n\nAn earlier version of the ad said, without evidence, that \u201cDemocrats let him into our country.\u201d That claim was deleted from the current version.\n\nThe new edit still shows masses of people shaking at a fence, apparently trying to break it down, and ends with the tagline, \u201cTrump and Republicans are making America safe again.\u201d\n\nNBC was the first of the three companies to say it was stopping the advertisement Monday, apparently after a fierce online response.\n\n\u201cAfter further review we recognize the insensitive nature of the ad and have decided to cease airing it across our properties as soon as possible,\u201d NBC Universal said in a statement.\n\nMarianne Gambelli, Fox News\u2019 president of advertising sales, said the commercial was pulled on Sunday \u201cupon further review.\u201d Fox did not immediately say how many times it had aired on either Fox News Channel or the Fox Business Network.\n\nFacebook initially ran the ad but that was an error, company spokesman Andy Stone said, because it violates the company\u2019s policy against sensation content.\n\nFacebook is still allowing its members to post the ad in their news feeds, however.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, tweeted that NBC News, CNN and Facebook had chosen \u201cto stand with those ILLEGALLY IN THIS COUNTRY.\u201d He said the media was trying to control what you see and think.\n\nParscale made no mention of Fox\u2019s decision.\n\nThe president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., had tweeted over the weekend, noting CNN\u2019s refusal to air the advertisement, that \u201cI guess they only run fake news and won\u2019t talk about real threats that don\u2019t suit their agenda.\u201d\n\nCNN said through Twitter that it was made \u201cabundantly clear\u201d through its coverage that the ad was racist and declined to air it when the campaign sought to buy airtime.", "FILE - In this July 13, 2013, file photo, Rapper Mac Miller performs on his Space Migration Tour at Festival Pier in Philadelphia.

Paramedics found Miller unresponsive in his Los Angeles home on Sept. 7 and declared him dead soon after. (Photo by Owen Sweeney/Invision/AP, File)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Rapper Mac Miller died from an accidental overdose caused by a combination of cocaine, alcohol, and the powerful opioid fentanyl, a coroner\u2019s report released Monday said.\n\nThe Los Angeles County coroner\u2019s report named Miller\u2019s cause of death as \u201cmixed toxicity\u201d of the three substances found in his system.\n\nThe 26-year-old Pittsburgh native, who frankly discussed his depression and addiction in his rhymes, died suddenly on Sept. 7. He was known to many as Ariana Grande\u2019s ex-boyfriend, but had a devoted following that included some of the biggest names in hip-hop.\n\nMiller\u2019s personal assistant, making a daily visit to Miller\u2019s home in the San Fernando Valley section of Los Angeles, found him unresponsive on his bed at about 11:30 a.m., the report states.\n\nThe assistant moved the body to the floor and performed CPR at the direction of a 911 operator. Paramedics soon arrived and Miller was declared dead 16 minutes after the initial 911 call.\n\nThe report says a police investigator found an empty bottle of liquor and drug paraphernalia, including a $20 bill with white powder residue on it that was in Miller\u2019s pocket.\n\nThe report notes that Miller\u2019s many tattoos included one of an hourglass on his arm with the words, \u201cOnly so much time left in this crazy world.\u201d\n\nThe rapper, whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was generally healthy otherwise, the report stated. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, but his mother told investigators he had not overdosed in the past to her knowledge, or been hospitalized for any reason.\n\nMiller\u2019s mother told a coroner\u2019s investigator that she had spoken to him the night before his death, and that he had been in good spirits, seeming very excited about a new album and upcoming tour.\n\nMiller\u2019s assistant agreed, saying Miller was feeling positive about his projects, but said he had a tendency to slip into drug binges, and had such an episode three days before the one that left him dead.\n\nThe autopsy was performed three days after Miller\u2019s death, but the cause of death was deferred while toxicology tests were performed.\n\nHe is the latest musician whose death has been linked in recent years to a national wave of opioid abuse and overdoses. Prince died in 2016 when he took counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl that looked like a generic version of the painkiller Vicodin.\n\nMiller\u2019s autopsy report did not address where he might have gotten the fentanyl or cocaine.\n\nMatthew Roberts, guitarist for the band 3 Doors Down, also died of an overdose in 2016, and had fentanyl and hydrocodone in his system.\n\nMiller\u2019s death brought mourning and tributes from musical luminaries. Performers at a concert in his honor last week included Chance the Rapper, Travis Scott and John Mayer. The concert launched the Mac Miller Circles Fund in honor of the hip-hop star and raised money for arts education in underserved communities.\n\nHe was in a two-year relationship with Ariana Grande that ended earlier this year. She posted an affectionate video of him on her Instagram page weeks after his death, and released a new song, \u201cThank U, Next ,\u201d on Saturday that mentioned Miller along with \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star Pete Davidson, her fiance until recently. In the song, she pays tribute to Miller.\n\n\u201cWish I could say thank you to Malcolm,\u201d the song says. \u201cCause he was an angel.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton .", "Supporters of President Donald Trump cheer as the president arrives to speak during a rally at Show Me Center, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, in Cape Girardeau, Mo..

Some White House staffers also came on stage, including Ivanka Trump, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Kellyane Conway.\n\nQUOTEABLE: Dan Bente drove four miles to attend but was not able to get in.

You remember an election two years ago? There were a lot of really happy people that night but there were some that were slightly not too happy \u2014 cry, baby, cry.\u201d\n\nPLAYING TO THE CROWD: Trump was at times jovial, joking at one point that it\u2019s not easy being married to him, and later saying that Vietnam\u2019s leaders told him West Virginia has the best coal.

(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda, File)\n\nBUCHAREST, Romania (AP) \u2014 Alexandru Visinescu, a Romanian communist-era prison guard serving a 20-year sentence for crimes against humanity, died Monday in prison at 93, Romanian authorities said.\n\nVisinescu was the first prison guard from the early years of communism to go on trial in Romania. He became a national symbol of the Communist era\u2019s brutality against its own people, most of whom who had simply fallen afoul of the regime.\n\nRomania had about 500,000 political prisoners under the Communist regime that was in power from 1947 until 1989, about one-fifth of whom died while in detention, according to historians.\n\nVisinescu died Monday at Rahova prison hospital, Bianca Filote, a spokeswoman for the Institute for Investigating the Crimes of Communism, told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cHe will forever be known as the torturer adopted by the communist Securitate secret police to kill. He ended the lives of defenseless human beings, physically and mentally,\u201d Andrei Muraru, who initiated the investigation into Visinescu\u2019s conduct in 2013, told the AP.\n\nVisinescu was convicted in 2015 for the abuse and killing of prisoners at Ramnicu Sarat prison in eastern Romania, where he was in command from 1956 to 1963. He was imprisoned in February 2016 after losing his appeal.\n\nFormer prisoners under Visinescu testified that they were denied access to medical treatment, heating, exercise and adequate food. They were held in solitary confinement and beatings were common. The prison housed members of Romania\u2019s intellectual, political and military elite.\n\n\u201cHe annihilated his victims in a sadistic program of physical and mental alienation, total isolation combined with physical torture,\u201d said Muraru.\n\nDuring his trial, Visinescu showed no remorse and insisted he was only following orders. A judge and prosecutor asked him six times why inmates died under his command. He answered just once, suggesting they died of old age.\n\nAt his final hearing, he wept and pleaded: \u201cLet me die!\u201d\n\nMuraru, a historian who is now an adviser to Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, said Visinescu would remain \u201cthe unmistakable face of the torturer, who was able to hide for half a century due to the ... post-communist system that protected him.\u201d\n\nHis lawyer, Camelia Niculescu, said Romania\u2019s current authorities wanted her client to die in prison.\n\nFuneral arrangements were not immediately available.", "HENSLEY, Ark. (AP) \u2014 A dam at a central Arkansas lake has many safety issues that indicate a lack of maintenance and could cause the structure to collapse, according to state officials.\n\nArkansas Natural Resources Commission engineer Stephen Smedley inspected the Lake Sandy dam this year and identified needed repairs that could cost at least a half million dollars, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.\n\nThe commission warned nearby homeowners of issues that could cause the dam to break, emptying the Saline County lake.\n\n\u201cThe internal erosion and voids could cause the dam to collapse,\u201d a letter to residents stated. \u201cThe many slides, slumps, erosion channels, large trees, rodent activity and animal burrows on the upstream and downstream slope are very concerning and indicate a lack of maintenance.\u201d\n\nProperty owners worry they\u2019ll be liable for damages if the unregulated dam fails.\n\nThe Lake Sandy Property Owners Association acquired the dam in 1992 and is responsible for its maintenance. The association had its last meeting in the mid- to late-1990s, and residents believe that\u2019s when dam maintenance stopped.\n\nIf dues had been collected and used to maintain the dam, some of the structure\u2019s larger problems could\u2019ve been prevented, Smedley said.\n\nBut Mike Oglesby, who lives in a camper by the lake, estimated that residents haven\u2019t paid dues to the association for at least 20 years.\n\nOglesby didn\u2019t know anything about the dam until this year, and neither did state dam safety officials. Arkansas has data on 410 regulated dams and nearly 900 more for informational purposes, but no documentation on Lake Sandy.

On a traditional ballot, voters will be choosing among three candidates for governor to replace the combative Republican Gov. Paul LePage. On a separate ballot, ranked-choice voting will make its national debut in races for U.S. House and Senate. Also on the ballot is a question that would make Maine the first state to provide homecare for all elderly and disabled residents, regardless of ability to pay. Voters also will decide four bond proposals.\n\nHere are some key races:\n\nBLAINE HOUSE TO GET NEW OCCUPANT\n\nVoters are deciding between Republican businessman Shawn Moody, Democratic Attorney General Janet Mills and independent state treasurer Terry Hayes.\n\nThe candidates credit LePage for steadying finances in this aging, rural state. They also agree the governor\u2019s office needs a change of tone after LePage\u2019s combative style.\n\nOutside groups have funded negative attack ads, but the candidates themselves have been largely civil.\n\nMoody, who founded a chain of auto body collision centers and ran for governor as an independent in 2010, has portrayed himself as an \u201coutsider businessman\u201d who will continue LePage\u2019s legacy. He got LePage\u2019s daughter, wife and political consultant on board, and the governor himself donated to Moody\u2019s run.\n\nMills, meanwhile, is focusing on grants, low-interest loans and broadband investments encouraging small businesses and people to live in Maine and work remotely. She\u2019s promised an \u201copen doors\u201d administration and says she\u2019ll protect the environment and LGBTQ and reproductive rights while welcoming new Mainers.\n\nHayes is focused on eliminating gridlock in Augusta, and supporting local programs that are working. She is running as a publicly funded candidate, and says she\u2019s not beholden to special interests.\n\nA NEW WAY OF VOTING\n\nRanked-choice voting is facing its biggest national test as the system is used for federal elections for the first time. The new system could mean delays of a week or more in declaring winners.\n\nThe system lets voters in the U.S. House and Senate races to rank all candidates from first to last on the ballot. A candidate with a majority of first-place votes is the winner.\n\nIf there\u2019s no majority winner, ballots will be shipped to Augusta late in the week for additional rounds of tallies in which last-place candidates are eliminated and second-place votes reallocated to the remaining field. The process is repeated until there\u2019s a majority winner.\n\nThe system is used in about a dozen municipalities across the country but Maine is the only place where it\u2019s used in statewide races, thanks to a referendum in 2016.\n\nRanked-choice voting is not being used in elections for governor or the Legislature because of concerns that the system runs afoul of the Maine Constitution. Because of this, there will be separate federal and state ballots for voters on Election Day.\n\nMAINE\u2019S MOST EXPENSIVE RACE\n\nMillions have poured into the large, rural 2nd Congressional District as Republican U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin faces a stiff challenge from Democratic state lawmaker Jared Golden. The race is one of the most competitive U.S. House races and has become the most expensive political race in Maine history.\n\nGolden, a former Marine, has married support for the 2nd Amendment with a populist economic message railing against Trump\u2019s signature tax cut as giveaways to the wealthy and efforts to kill the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPoliquin has attempted to dismiss Golden as a \u201cyoung radical with a socialist agenda.\u201d He said Maine\u2019s economy is improving, with low unemployment, thanks to GOP efforts to lower tax rates for small businesses and families, cut red tape and fight bad trade deals.\n\nIn the 1st District, Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree is battling independent state lawmaker Marty Grohman and Republican Mark Holbrook. In the Senate race, Independent incumbent Angus King is being challenged by Republican Eric Brakey and Democrat Zak Ringelstein.\n\nUNIVERSAL HOME CARE\n\nThe most hotly contested referendum would provide universal home care for seniors and people with disabilities.\n\nAn estimated 27,000 Mainers needing help with daily living could receive assistance from stipends for family caregivers to funding for professional nursing, home health aides, home repair, rent subsidies and transportation.\n\nBut there is criticism of the way it\u2019s funded. LePage, the current governor, and all three gubernatorial candidates are opposed, saying the proposal is unfair and expensive.\n\nMeanwhile, four bond questions would authorize $200 million in state borrowing altogether.\n\nThe proposed bonds include $30 million to fund wastewater infrastructure projects and $106 million for roads and bridges. Remaining bonds would OK $64 million for facility upgrades for Maine\u2019s public universities and community colleges.\n\nMAINE LEGISLATURE\n\nNational Democratic groups hoping to gain influence over 2020 redistricting are spending heavily to flip Maine\u2019s state Senate and gain more seats in the Maine House.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are hoping support for President Trump in inland Maine counties will help conservatives maintain 18-17 control of the state Senate.\n\nDemocrats have 73 seats in the 151-seat House, while Republicans have 70. Several lawmakers left their party in the last year, and roughly two dozen independent and third-party candidates are running for legislative office.\n\nThe next Legislature will make key decisions on issues such as voter-approved legalization of marijuana retail sales and the opioid crisis. Legislative gridlock under the LePage administration fueled a 2017 three-day state government shutdown and delayed state action on big issues such as the opioid crisis.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "TOPEKA, Kan.

PRICE\n\nAssociated Press\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Nevada voters will decide pivotal races for U.S. Senate and governor that could set a course for state politics for a decade.\n\nTheir ballots also will determine if Democrats keep two Las Vegas-area seats in the U.S. House, and whether Republicans hold onto five statewide offices.\n\nMore than 50 legislative races and six statewide ballot questions are also on the ballot.\n\n___\n\nU.S. SENATE\n\nNevada has one of a handful of close races that could help flip control of the U.S. Senate from Republican to Democrat.\n\nIncumbent Dean Heller has been in the Senate since he was appointed to fill a vacancy in 2011. He is the only GOP senator in the nation seeking another term in a state Hillary Clinton won in 2016.\n\nHeller\u2019s opponent is U.S. Rep. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat who represents a Las Vegas-area district. She is a former computer programmer and software consultant who was managing a synagogue when longtime Nevada Sen. Harry Reid recruited her to run for office in 2016.\n\nShe\u2019s not as well-known as Heller, who has held state and federal elected offices in the state for nearly three decades.\n\nRosen could benefit from a wave of Democratic and female activism fueled by opposition to President Donald Trump.\n\nHeller, meanwhile, has grown close to Trump after a rocky start, with both highlighting a desire to get more of the president\u2019s judicial nominees confirmed.\n\n___\n\nU.S. HOUSE\n\nTwo open House seats drew familiar faces in southern Nevada.\n\nThe 3rd District, held by Rosen, is a race between education philanthropist Susie Lee, a Democrat, and Republican Danny Tarkanian \u2014 the son of former University of Nevada Las Vegas basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian. Danny Tarkanian has made half a dozen runs for office since 2004 but has not yet won an election.\n\nTheir district is split fairly evenly, and Tarkanian lost it to Rosen two years ago by fewer than 4,000 votes.\n\nThe race in Nevada\u2019s 4th District is a matchup between two men who each held the seat for a single term.\n\nDemocrat Steven Horsford, who held the seat until 2014, is running against Republican Cresent Hardy. Hardy won the seat in 2014 but lost it two years later to Democrat Ruben Kihuen.\n\nKihuen, the state\u2019s first Latino elected to the U.S. House, was a rising star in state politics but decided not to seek another term amid multiple sexual harassment allegations, which he has denied.\n\nIn Nevada\u2019s other two congressional races, U.S. Rep. Dina Titus, a Democrat, and U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei, a Republican, are expected to cruise to re-election.\n\n___\n\nGOVERNOR\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, a Republican from a political dynasty is running against a powerful Las Vegas-area Democrat.\n\nNevada hasn\u2019t had a Democratic governor in nearly two decades, and the one elected Tuesday will oversee the redrawing of congressional and state legislative districts after the next U.S. Census.\n\nDemocrat Steve Sisolak, who chairs the council that oversees the Las Vegas Strip, became a prominent figure following last year\u2019s mass shooting at a country music festival. His opponent is Republican Attorney General Adam Laxalt, the grandson of former U.S. Sen. and Nevada Gov. Paul Laxalt and son of former U.S. Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico.\n\nLaxalt has aligned himself with Trump and the NRA but did not earn the endorsement of current GOP Gov. Brian Sandoval. Ryan Bundy, the son of rancher Cliven Bundy who was involved in two armed standoffs with federal agents, is making an independent run for governor.\n\n___\n\nOTHER STATEWIDE RACES\n\nVoters also will also decide contests for attorney general, secretary of state, lieutenant governor, treasurer and state controllers.\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s race is between Democrat Aaron Ford, the Nevada Senate majority leader, and Republican Wes Duncan, the former assistant state attorney general.\n\nRepublican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske is being challenged for re-election by Democratic state Assemblyman Nelson Araujo.\n\nIn the open lieutenant governor\u2019s race, Nevada Senate Minority Leader Michael Roberson faces Democrat Kate Marshall, the former state treasurer.\n\nThe race for state treasurer is also open. Republican Bob Beers is running against Democrat Zach Conine. Incumbent GOP Controller Ron Knecht is being challenged by Democrat Catherine Byrne.\n\n___\n\nLEGISLATURE, BALLOT QUESTIONS\n\nMore than 50 legislative seats are up for election.\n\nVoters will decide not only whether to keep the Legislature under Democratic control but whether to give Democrats a supermajority by electing a few more.\n\nNevada could also make history by electing the country\u2019s first female-majority legislature. Women would need to win at least five seats \u2014 four in competitive races \u2014 to take the majority.\n\nOne race where a female candidate faces an uphill battle is Assembly District 36. Democratic educator Lesia Romanov is running in a GOP-majority district against Republican Dennis Hof \u2014 Nevada\u2019s best-known brothel owner, who died in October. If Hof is elected, county officials will pick another Republican to fill the seat.\n\nVoters also will settle six ballot questions, including one that would break up a monopoly by electric utility NV Energy.

Orrin Hatch, who is retiring after serving more than 40 years in the Senate.\n\nRepublicans voters outnumber Democrats by nearly 4-to-1 in the predominantly Mormon state, where Romney is revered. He was the first Mormon presidential nominee from a major party, and he helped turn around Salt Lake City\u2019s 2002 Winter Olympics after a bribery scandal.\n\nWilson is a member of the Salt Lake County Council and is the daughter of a former mayor, but she faces long odds. The state has not sent a Democrat to the U.S. Senate since Hatch defeated Sen. Frank Moss in 1976.\n\nA win by Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, would give Utah a political veteran with more gravitas than most rookie senators. For Republicans nationally, Romney is expected to serve as a moral counterweight to a president many in the GOP see as divisive and undignified.\n\nRomney has softened his criticism of President Donald Trump during his Utah campaign. But he issued an online essay last week countering Trump\u2019s characterization of the media as an \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d by saying a free press is essential to the \u201ccause of freedom.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLOVE TRIES TO FEND OFF DEMOCRAT\n\nLove, the first black female Republican in Congress, is trying to hold off a major challenge from Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams and a bid by the Democrats to flip the largely suburban district.\n\nThe race is expected to be the closest of the state\u2019s four House races. Republican incumbents Rob Bishop, Chris Stewart and John Curtis are expected to easily win.\n\nMcAdams has touted himself as a moderate and said he would not support Nancy Pelosi as House speaker in hopes of appealing to unaffiliated voters who account for 38 percent of the district\u2019s voters.

But win or lose, state leaders have vowed to join 30 other states in legalizing pot for people with certain conditions.\n\nAfter months of fierce debate and campaigning, Mormon church leaders, state lawmakers and the governor \u2014 all opponents of the initiative \u2014 reached a compromise with medical marijuana advocates in which they agreed on parameters for a law that suited all sides.\n\nIf the ballot initiative passes, it will be revised to fit the compromise. If it fails, a new law will be drafted. Gov. Gary Herbert has promised to call a special session after the election to make that happen.\n\nMormon leaders had opposed the ballot proposal over fears it could lead to more broad use, but agreed to the compromise to allow access for people with serious medical needs. The faith had long frowned upon medical marijuana use because of a key church health code called the \u201cWord of Wisdom,\u201d which prohibits coffee as well as alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs.\n\nMedical marijuana advocates are backing the deal to avoid wrangling and uncertainty that could continue if the ballot initiative passes.\n\nThe ballot initiative would create a state-regulated growing and dispensing operation and allow people with certain medical conditions to use the drug in edible forms. It does not allow pot smoking.\n\nUnlike the ballot initiative, the compromise won\u2019t allow people to grow their own marijuana if they live too far from a dispensary. It also bars certain types of edible marijuana that could appeal to children, like cookies and brownies.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I.

A rate hike in December would mark the fourth this year.\n\nFurther rate increases are expected in 2019, though just how many is a subject of speculation. On the eve of Congress\u2019 midterm elections, the U.S. economy remains vigorous even in its 10th year of expansion \u2014 the second-longest such stretch on record.\n\nIn deciding how fast or slowly to keep raising rates, the Fed will be monitoring the pace of growth, the job market\u2019s strength and gauges of inflation for clues to how the economy may evolve in the coming months. The brisk pace of economic growth \u2014 a 3.5 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, after a 4.2 percent rate in the previous quarter \u2014 has raised the risk that inflation could begin accelerating.\n\nIn its most recent forecast, the Fed projected that it would raise rates three additional times in 2019. Some economists, though, foresee only two hikes. Others expect economic growth to remain solid and the job market strong and that the Fed will decide that four rate increases will be justified next year to guard against high inflation. At 3.7 percent, the unemployment rate is already at its lowest level since 1969.\n\n\u201cThe Fed is going to have to continue raising rates next year because the unemployment rate is going to keep falling to close to 3 percent, well beyond full employment,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThere is nothing but green lights for more rate hikes straight ahead.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the government reported that the economy added a sizable 250,000 jobs in October and that average pay rose 3.1 percent over the previous 12 months \u2014 the sharpest year-over-year gain in nearly a decade. That\u2019s welcome news for workers. But it\u2019s a trend that may raise concern that accelerating wages will help fuel undesirably high inflation.\n\nChairman Jerome Powell has stressed that the Fed is determined to follow a middle-of-the-road approach: Keep gradually nudging up rates to control inflation but avoid tightening too aggressively and perhaps triggering a recession.\n\n\u201cThey are walking a tightrope,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n\nThe Fed has raised rates three times this year, lifting its benchmark rate to a range \u2014 2 percent to 2.25 percent \u2014 that is still low by historical standards. Most economists think the statement the Fed will issue Thursday after its policy meeting ends will hint of another imminent increase, likely in December.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s policymakers have stressed, and most economists agree, that these small quarter-point increases amount to a gradual pace of credit tightening. But President Donald Trump has sharply disagreed, and since the stock market started tumbling last month, he has attacked the Fed\u2019s rate hikes as well as Powell\u2019s leadership. Trump\u2019s public criticism has aroused concern that he is intruding on the central bank\u2019s long-respected political independence and its need to operate free of outside pressure.\n\nAt the same time, the nervousness among stock investors reflects the reality that the Fed\u2019s steady march toward higher rates is removing a key factor that has underpinned the bull market in stocks: The richer returns that investors could achieve in stocks than in bonds or savings accounts.\n\nFed critics had charged that the central bank was creating a bubble in stocks that would eventually pop with disastrous results. Trump, who has often invoked high stock prices as evidence that his economic policies are succeeding, has made clear his disagreement. He has called the Fed, with its string of rate increases, \u201cmy biggest threat.\u201d\n\nPowell, who was Trump\u2019s hand-picked choice to lead the Fed, has avoided responding directly. The chairman has instead expressed determination to pursue the Fed\u2019s mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices without regard to political considerations.\n\nTo that end, Swonk, like Zandi, suggests that the Fed will raise rates four times next year because she thinks the economy will slow only slightly. Other analysts foresee a more significant slowdown as the tariffs Trump has imposed on many imports begins to depress growth.\n\n\u201cThe economic outlook will not be strengthening next year; it will be weakening, not only in the U.S. but also globally,\u201d said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at SS Economics.\n\nSohn said he thinks the Fed may decide to tighten credit only once or twice in 2019.\n\nDavid Jones, the author of books about the Fed, said he thinks that after December, the central bank will raise rates twice more in 2019 and then stop. Jones said he bases that forecast on his belief that the Fed won\u2019t want to lift rates above what it sees as the \u201cneutral\u201d level. This is the point at which the Fed\u2019s key rate is thought to neither stimulate the economy nor restrain it.\n\nThe median assessment of Fed officials has pegged the neutral rate at 3 percent. One more rate increase this year and two more in 2019 would leave the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate at a range of 2.75 percent to 3 percent.\n\n\u201cI think Powell is determined to get to neutral and then see how the economy performs,\u201d Jones said.", "Turkey detains 24 as part of IS group financial probe\n\nANKARA, Turkey (AP) \u2014 Turkey\u2019s state-run news agency says police detained 24 people as part of an investigation into the Islamic State group\u2019s international financial dealings.\n\nAnadolu Agency reported on Monday the suspects were detained in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir and 10 other Turkish provinces over alleged money transfers to Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Indonesia and Libya.\n\nThe agency cited the Diyarbakir prosecutor\u2019s office for its report but did not provide the suspects\u2019 nationalities.\n\nAnadolu says police also seized nearly $580,000, as well as euros, Turkish and Syrian currency.\n\nA series of deadly attacks in Turkey has been blamed on IS militants, including a New Year\u2019s attack at an Istanbul nightclub in the early hours of 2017 that killed 39 people.", "Post Bulletin, Oct. 30\n\nACT scores tell the truth about Minnesota schools\n\nThe rejection \u2014 some might say abject failure \u2014 of the national No Child Left Behind Act in 2015 reaffirmed the authority of individual states to set their own goals and standards for student achievement.\n\nFair enough. Education isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all endeavor, and what works at an inner-city school in New Orleans won\u2019t necessary succeed in an upscale Seattle suburb or a small town in Appalachia. States and individual school districts decide what\u2019s best for their students and what standards those students must meet to advance and graduate.\n\nBut students who wish to go on to college must clear another, far less subjective hurdle \u2014 the ACT or SAT exam. In a world where truth has become slippery and every fact seems to have an alternative, the questions on these college entrance exams have right answers and wrong answers. Any measurement of a state\u2019s and/or community\u2019s success in educating its children must consider their performance on these standardized tests.\n\nMinnesota is doing very, very well.\n\nOf the 19 states where at least 90 percent of 2018\u2032s high school graduates took the ACT, Minnesota ranks No. 1 with an average score of 21.3 out of 36.\n\nTo fully grasp how good that score is, consider the average score in Iowa, another perennial ACT powerhouse with a strong reputation for its public schools system. In the Hawkeye State, the average ACT score for last spring\u2019s graduates was 21.8. That\u2019s higher than Minnesota\u2019s average score, but just barely \u2014 and only 68 percent of Iowa\u2019s graduates took the exam.\n\nIn Minnesota, 99 percent of graduates took the ACT. Districts statewide administer the exam free of charge in students\u2019 junior year as part of the state\u2019s regular battery of standardized tests, so almost everyone takes it, including students who don\u2019t plan to attend a four-year college or university.\n\nSo, to put the matter in sports terms, Iowa squeaked out a victory by playing only its high-scoring players, while Minnesota played everyone on its roster, including students who have learning disabilities, live below the poverty line or speak English as a second language.\n\nWe can think of no better proof that Minnesota has one of the nation\u2019s best educational systems.\n\nGranted, it would be easier and cheaper to let kids opt out of the ACT, but we applaud the policy of having all students take a national exam in math, language and science. For some students, this test is a much-needed reality check, a notice that they have work to do before they set foot on a college campus. On the other hand, we suspect that some students are pleasantly surprised when they receive their scores. Kids surrounded by high-achieving peers can underestimate their own abilities until they see hard data that says, \u201cYou\u2019re smart, too!\u201d\n\nSpeaking of smart, 10 as-yet-unidentified Rochester students earned perfect scores of 36 on the ACT exam in the past 12 months, and the average score for the district\u2019s students was 22.3, well above the state and national averages.\n\nThose numbers tell us that great things are happening in our schools \u2014 and we can state with full confidence that those numbers don\u2019t lie.\n\n___\n\nThe Free Press of Mankato, Nov. 1\n\nCitizenship: Presidents don\u2019t get to decide\n\nWhy it matters: President Trump said this week he will abolish birthright citizenship, which is enshrined in the Constitution.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough that an American president claims the right to unilaterally override a constitutional amendment, as Donald Trump did this week in pledging to abolish birthright citizenship.\n\nIt will be worse if Trump\u2019s intent, voiced in an interview released Tuesday by Axios, is seriously attempted \u2014 and worse yet if his partisan colleagues in Congress meekly acquiesce in such an unconstitutional maneuver.\n\nThe 14th Amendment \u2014 one of the Reconstruction Amendments ratified in the wake of the Civil War \u2014 opens with an unambiguous sentence: All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. (The exception clause refers to the children of foreign diplomats, who have legal immunity from U.S. laws.)\n\nThis sentence overrode the Dred Scott decision, that blot on American history and jurisprudence in which the Supreme Court declared that blacks have \u201cno rights that the white man was obliged to respect.\u201d\n\nTrump, as is his wont, lies about the subject, claiming that the United States is unique in granting citizenship to all born in its territory. The truth is that 33 nations, mostly in the western hemisphere, follow the practice.\n\nThe president is far from the only Republican who dislikes birthright citizenship, but the likes of Sens. Lindsay Graham and Mitch McConnell have always recognized that changing it requires a constitutional amendment. Trump now claims that not only is an amendment unnecessary, he doesn\u2019t need Congress to act either.\n\nThis is several bridges too far.\n\nRepublican tolerance of this dangerous nonsense undermines their oft-stated claim of insisting on strict judicial interpretation of the Constitution. To redefine the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment by executive fiat would be precisely the opposite. It should not be attempted, and if attempted should not be tolerated.\n\n___\n\nMinneapolis Star Tribune, Nov. 2\n\nThe new war on birthright citizenship\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s guarantee is part of the greatness of America.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in his zeal to continue his crackdown on immigrants, has resurrected an old, mostly fringe argument: that the United States should no longer guarantee citizenship to those born on American soil. It is a notion rooted in fear and antithetical to the very Constitution he swore to uphold.\n\nThe 14th Amendment is an eloquent, uplifting statement on what it means to be an American. It offers equal protection under the law not just to citizens but to all who reside here. It clarifies \u2014 in ways the original Constitution did not \u2014 who can be an American citizen: \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d\n\nFor 150 years, that has been the constitutional promise of this country, that those lucky enough to be born here would be Americans from their first breath. The notion arose out of the searing divisions left by the Civil War, when some states were determined to withhold citizenship from the children of slaves. Those 1868 authors could have crafted an amendment that extended citizenship to slaves alone. Certainly such arguments were advanced at the time. Instead, the authors went much further.\n\nAnthony Winer, a constitutional law professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, calls the 14th Amendment \u201cone of the most consequential and transformative amendments we have.\u201d According to Winer and the vast majority of legal scholars, the clause that Trump and some others are pinning their hopes on, \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof,\u201d is widely understood as applying to the children of foreign diplomats and enemy soldiers \u2014 not immigrants, regardless of legal status.\n\nTrump may be dismayed that James C. Ho, whom he recently elevated to the vaunted Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in D.C., is among those legal experts. A conservative constitutional scholar who clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Ho offered an eloquent and detailed defense of the amendment in 2011, saying that \u201cthe text of the Citizenship Clause plainly guarantees birthright citizenship to the U.S.-born children of all persons subject to U.S. sovereign authority and laws.\u201d Ho said that \u201cthe sweeping language\u201d of the 1898 high court decision in U.S. vs. Wong Kim Ark, which turned on this issue of citizenship, \u201creaches all aliens regardless of immigration status.\u201d\n\nWiner said the understanding of that clause is so widely held that he is dubious that any attorney or expert of standing would tell Trump that he could alter the Constitution by executive order alone. In any reasonable administration, the attorney general would advise the president how unlikely he would be to prevail. A Congress that stood for something besides fealty to the president would defend the Constitution. At least outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan came out against the proposal, saying, \u201cYou cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order .? We didn\u2019t like it when (President) Obama tried changing immigration laws via executive action and obviously as conservatives we believe in the Constitution.\u201d\n\nSadly, these are not normal times.

Surely then you can stop worrying about your credit scores.\n\nWell, not really, although there are situations when credit scores shouldn\u2019t be anyone\u2019s main concern.\n\nLet\u2019s start with some reasons why credit scores still matter, even when you don\u2019t plan to borrow money.\n\nLENDERS AREN\u2019T THE ONLY ONES CHECKING YOUR CREDIT\n\nMost insurers use credit-based insurance scores, which use information from credit reports to help set premiums for auto, homeowners and renters policies. A drop from excellent to poor credit can more than triple homeowners\u2019 premiums in some states. Credit can have a bigger impact on auto insurance premiums than any other factor, including someone\u2019s driving record, according to an investigation by Consumer Reports.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Cellphone companies often reserve their best deals for those with the best credit. Many employers check credit reports, which could be an issue should you want to work or return to work in retirement. Utilities and landlords also typically check credit scores, which might become an issue if you move. Senior housing, assisted living and continuing care retirement communities also may use credit histories or scores to evaluate applicants.\n\nYOUR BORROWING DAYS MAY NOT BE OVER\n\nLife happens. You may need to borrow money to pay medical bills, replace a car, help a family member, make home repairs or remodel your home to allow you to age in place. If you have to move, you may need a new mortgage. If money gets tight, you may want to access some your home equity with a reverse mortgage.\n\nReverse mortgages allow homeowners age 62 and older to tap their home equity without having to repay the loan until they sell, move out or die. Reverse mortgage lenders typically don\u2019t have minimum credit score requirements, but a credit check is part of the financial assessment needed to get the loan.\n\nKEEPING GOOD SCORES ISN\u2019T THAT HARD\n\nA single credit card is enough to maintain good credit scores. Any card will do, as long as it reports to all three credit bureaus (most do). The card should be used lightly but regularly and balances paid in full, since there\u2019s no credit score advantage to carrying debt.\n\nWHEN CREDIT SCORES SHOULDN\u2019T BE YOUR TOP PRIORITY\n\nA lifetime habit of responsible bill payment can be hard to break. But financial well-being sometimes requires putting concerns about credit on the back burner, especially as you get older. Some examples:\n\nYOU\u2019RE STRUGGLING TO PAY YOUR BILLS: It makes little sense to keep sending money to credit card companies and most other lenders if you\u2019re having trouble paying for necessities: shelter, food, utilities, medications. You also need help if you\u2019re being sued over debt or hounded by collectors. Consider talking to a credit counselor affiliated with the National Foundation for Credit Counseling and to an experienced bankruptcy attorney about your options.\n\nYOU NEED TO FILE BANKRUPTCY: If bankruptcy is the best option, you have plenty of company. The rate of Americans over 65 filing for bankruptcy has tripled since 1991, according to the Consumer Bankruptcy Project. But bankruptcy is not the credit score killer it\u2019s often reputed to be. Credit scores typically plunge in the months before a bankruptcy filing, but then start to rise soon after. With responsible credit use, it\u2019s possible to get back to near-prime credit scores within a few years after bankruptcy.\n\nYOU\u2019RE TRYING TO ESCAPE AN ONEROUS TIMESHARE: There is often no easy way out of a timeshare, a kind of vacation ownership that requires paying annual fees and other costs. Sometimes owners can give the timeshare back to the resort developer, or sell or give it away. Other times, the only way to get rid of it is to stop paying and experience the consequences, which can include foreclosure and credit score damage.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to predict the potential costs of lower credit scores, but older people with less reason to borrow may well decide the hit to their scores \u2014 which can linger for up to seven years for most negative marks, and up to 10 years for bankruptcy \u2014 is better than continuing to struggle for the rest of their lives.\n\n_______\n\nThis column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet .

(Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News via AP, Pool, File)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Texas\u2019 hotly contested U.S. Senate race accelerated Monday toward potentially the closest finish in decades as Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke scraped their polarized bases for any last voters in a burst of final rallies in liberal big cities and Trump-loving suburbs.\n\nIn Texas, where nearly 4.9 million early voters has already surpassed turnout in the previous midterm elections , O\u2019Rourke and Cruz delivered their anxious supporters similar warnings in a state unaccustomed to close calls: far bigger numbers were still needed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see tomorrow record-breaking Democratic turnout,\u201d Cruz told a crowd in Pearland, a typical Republican stronghold outside Houston, while imploring them to each get five people they know to the polls Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take. Because we know the far-left is angry and they are coming after jobs, they are coming after freedom, they are coming after security.\u201d\n\nPolls have shown a surprisingly tight race in Texas, which hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 30 years. For Cruz, the stop in a Pearland megachurch was what he called his 48th campaign rally in six weeks \u2014 a defensive campaign blitz on Texas\u2019 conservative turf that even a year ago would\u2019ve seemed unnecessary.\n\nTexas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz acknowledged he expects there to be high voter turnout among Democrats who support his rival, Rep. Beto O'Rourke. Cruz urged supporters to counter that turnout by voting and encouraging others to do the same. (Nov. 5)\n\nBut O\u2019Rourke\u2019s supercharged, expectation-defying campaign that took him to each of Texas\u2019 254 counties and raised a blockbuster $70 million has made the race one of the most closely watched in the country heading into Tuesday\u2019s deeply divisive midterm elections, which President Donald Trump is calling a referendum on his combative presidency.\n\nFor nearly a year, O\u2019Rourke has run as a genial and proudly liberal antidote to the Trump-era GOP and reaffirmed in the closing weeks of his underdog bid that he would vote to impeach, a position that even most Democrats have avoided.\n\nO\u2019Rourke began his final full day of campaigning in Houston and Dallas, Texas\u2019 biggest Democratic cities, before making his way home to El Paso.\n\nHis last appeals to voters included more humane immigration policies at a time when Trump has sent troops to the border and issued dire warnings about a caravan of immigrants, mostly from Central America, walking through Mexico and slowly toward the U.S. border.\n\n\u201cAt the time they seek to divide us and polarize us and scare us about one another it\u2019s precisely at that moment that Texas stands up,\u201d he said. \u201cNot as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as Americans and, as human beings, to rewrite this country\u2019s immigration policies.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have been shut out of statewide office in Texas since the 1990s and recent elections haven\u2019t even been close. But at the same time, turnout in Texas so far has also been nothing like recent elections.\n\nThe final tally Tuesday could be more in line with presidential years that typically draw higher levels of turnout. Nearly 9 million people voted in 2016, when Trump won Texas by 9 points, making him the first Republican presidential candidate in two decades to not carry the state by double digits.\n\nSingle-digit U.S. Senate races are even rarer in Texas \u2014 the last one happened in 1978.\n\nO\u2019Rourke is planning to cast his own vote Tuesday in El Paso, where he has been a three-term congressman. Cruz already cast his ballot in his hometown of Houston, where he will watch the returns on election night.\n\n___\n\nFor the AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul J.

(AP Photo/Paul White)\n\nMADRID (AP) \u2014 After only two games, Santiago Solari is making Real Madrid fans forget about the search for a new coach.\n\nAnd Madrid may very well give it up if he keeps succeeding.\n\nSolari has done well since taking over from Julen Lopetegui, pleasing players and fans, and increasing his chances of taking over the squad permanently.\n\nDiscussions about Antonio Conte and Roberto Martinez have faded since Solari took control and quickly put Madrid back on track. In his short time in charge, Solari boosted the squad\u2019s confidence and got the victories that had eluded the team.\n\nThe former Madrid player arrived with the club in crisis and enduring a run that included five losses in seven matches in all competitions, including a demoralizing 5-1 loss to Barcelona at Camp Nou.\n\nThe 2-0 win over Valladolid on Saturday halted the team\u2019s five-match winless streak in the Spanish league. Madrid had entered the match at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium having lost four of its last five games in the competition, including three straight.\n\n\u201cReal Madrid needed the victory. It\u2019s not easy to win when you are going through a difficult moment,\u201d Solari said. \u201cFootball is all about state of mind, emotions, self-confidence.\u201d\n\nIn the Argentine\u2019s first game in charge, Madrid routed third-division club Melilla 4-0 in the Copa del Rey, scoring the same number of goals that Lopetegui\u2019s team had netted in the seven previous matches.\n\nTRUSTING VINICIUS JUNIOR\n\nOne of the right moves made by Solari was to give more playing time to Vinicius Junior, the young Brazilian forward who arrived amid high expectations but had been relegated to the \u201cB\u2033 team under Lopetegui.\n\nVinicius Junior was the man of the match against Melilla and helped open up the game when Madrid struggled against Valladolid. He came off the bench in the 73rd minute and 10 minutes later scored the team\u2019s opening goal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep going step by step to try to get back to where we deserve to be,\u201d Vinicius Junior said.\n\nThe decision to give more chances to Vinicius Junior was highly popular, helping Solari earn credit with the tough Madrid crowd and further increase his chances of staying on the job.\n\nSOLID DEFENSE\n\nSolari also didn\u2019t hesitate to use young fullbacks Alvaro Odriozola and Sergio Reguilon in defense while the regular starters were injured. Lopetegui thought differently and often improvised players at the back when needed.\n\nThe defense improved under the Argentine coach, with two consecutive clean sheets. Madrid had conceded 10 goals in its last seven matches under Lopetegui.\n\nAWAY CHALLENGES\n\nSolari will be fully tested in a stretch in which Madrid will play four consecutive games away from the Bernabeu, starting on Wednesday at Viktoria Plzen in the Champions League.\n\nThe team then plays at Celta Vigo and at Eibar in the Spanish league, and finishes the month with a Champions League match against Roma in Italy.\n\nIf Solari survives and is still in charge by then, it will mean Madrid\u2019s search for a new coach will likely be over.\n\nFLIRTING WITH RELEGATION\n\nWhat started as a promising season has turned into an endless struggle for Villarreal and Valencia.\n\nThe two clubs finished fourth and fifth in the league a year ago, and both had high hopes entering this season.\n\nNeither team can get things going, though, with Valencia in 15th place and Villarreal in 16th.\n\nValencia, with only one win in 11 league matches, is two points from the relegation zone. Villarreal, with two wins, is one point away.\n\nThey are just in front of Athletic Bilbao, another struggling team which usually contends for the positions near the top of the table.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni", "2 men missing after car goes into Chicago\u2019s Calumet River\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Authorities are searching for two men whose car plunged into the Calumet River in Chicago over the weekend.\n\nWBBM-TV reports that the Pontiac Grand Prix was recovered Sunday but two men weren\u2019t inside.

Net neutrality traces back to an engineering maxim called the \u201cend-to-end principle,\u201d a self-regulating network that put control in the hands of end users rather than a central authority. Traditional cable-TV services, for instance, required special equipment and controlled what channels are shown on TV. With an end-to-end network like the internet, the types of equipment, apps, articles and video services permitted are limited only to imagination. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 For a fundamentally nerdy subject, net neutrality is pushing a lot of political buttons.\n\nThe latest salvo is over a California law that restores a ban on cable, wireless and other broadband providers from impeding people\u2019s ability to use their favorite apps and services. The federal government had rescinded that ban, and the Trump administration is seeking to block California\u2019s effort as an imposition on federal prerogatives.\n\nThough net neutrality started off more than a decade ago as an insight into how to make networks work most efficiently, it has taken on much larger social and political dimensions lately. The issue has emerged as an anti-monopoly rallying point and even a focus for \u201cresistance\u201d to the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cAny time the cable companies and the Trump administration are on one side, it looks good for companies to be on the other side,\u201d Boston Law School professor Daniel Lyons said.\n\nBut the idea hasn\u2019t always been political or partisan. Net neutrality traces back to an engineering maxim called the \u201cend-to-end principle,\u201d a self-regulating network that put control in the hands of end users rather than a central authority. Traditional cable-TV services, for instance, required special equipment and controlled what channels are shown on TV. With an end-to-end network like the internet, the types of equipment, apps, articles and video services permitted are limited only to imagination.\n\nAnd the internet subsequently grew like nobody\u2019s business \u2014 largely because it wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s business.\n\nBut as internet use expanded, so did the power of the big companies that offer internet service to the masses. It became clear that they could, and sometimes would, restrict what people did. The Associated Press found in 2007 that Comcast was blocking or slowing down some file-sharing. AT&T blocked Skype and other internet-calling services on the iPhone until 2009.\n\nLaw professor Tim Wu, now at Columbia University, coined the term \u201cnet neutrality\u201d in 2003 to argue for government rules that would prevent big internet providers from discriminating against technology and services that clashed with other aspects of their business. Allowing such discrimination, he reasoned, would choke off innovation.\n\nBig telecommunications companies, on the other hand, argue that they should be able to control the pipes they built and owned.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission subscribed to the principle of net neutrality for over a decade and enshrined that as specific rules in 2015 under chairman Tom Wheeler, an Obama appointee. Among the rules: Broadband companies couldn\u2019t block websites and apps of their choosing. Nor could they charge Netflix and other video services extra to reach viewers more smoothly.\n\nOnce President Donald Trump took office, net neutrality became one of his first targets as part of broader government deregulation. The FCC chairman he appointed, Ajit Pai, made rollback a top priority.\n\nAnd thus net neutrality became increasingly political. As a vote loomed for months, the once-obscure concept was debated endlessly on talk shows and online chats. Big-time Hollywood producer Shonda Rhimes tweeted a link to a story about saving net-neutrality on her lifestyle website. Actor Mark Ruffalo urged people to contact members of Congress by tweeting, \u201cLong live cute dog videos on YouTube! #RIPinternet.\u201d\n\nThe debate created strange bedfellows: Support for net neutrality comes from many of the same people who are also critical of the data-sucking tech giants who benefit from it.\n\nYet on net neutrality, these tech companies got to be the \u201cgood guy,\u201d siding on the side of the younger \u201cdigital first\u201d generation and consumer groups calling for more protection. No matter that these companies are keeping their own business interests at heart, as a net-neutrality rollback could mean higher costs for access to the \u201cpipes.\u201d\n\nPoliticians glommed on to the debate to appear consumer friendly.\n\n\u201cNo politician will ever lose votes by supporting net neutrality,\u201d said Gus Hurwitz, law professor at the University of Nebraska and a member of the conservative group The Federalist Society. \u201cIt\u2019s an ill-defined term that voters don\u2019t really understand other than that it is a scary concept they know they don\u2019t want to lose.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, ISPs haven\u2019t done themselves any favors in appealing to the consumer. They\u2019ve long had a reputation for bad service and high prices. Unlike the high-profile support for net neutrality, the opposition was limited to behind-the-scenes lobbying.\n\nNonetheless, the FCC rolled back the net-neutrality rules last December on a 3-2 party-line vote. The decision took effect in June.\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear appeals from the broadband industry to strike down a lower court ruling in 2016 that was in favor of net neutrality. That effectively shut down an appeal that had already become largely moot when the FCC rolled back the rules. But in other arenas the fight is likely to drag on.\n\nSeveral tech companies including Mozilla and Vimeo are challenging the FCC\u2019s rollback decision in a federal appeals court. That\u2019s separate from the challenge to the California law, which is on hold until the tech companies\u2019 lawsuit is resolved. Oral arguments in the tech companies\u2019 case are expected in February.\n\nOregon, Washington and Vermont have also approved legislation related to net neutrality.\n\nAnd a Democratic takeover of the House in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections could revive efforts to enact net neutrality into federal law, though Trump would likely veto any such attempts.\n\n\u201cNet neutrality is only the fifth round of a 12-round boxing match,\u201d Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives said.", "ORONO, Maine (AP) \u2014 The University of Maine System is expanding a program that allows high school students to take classes for college credit.\n\nThe Portland Press Herald reports officials are increasing support for the Early College program.

But Crow had a decided fundraising advantage, especially after national Republican donors pulled out of Coffman\u2019s campaign to focus on races where they saw a better chance of winning. The contest will help determine whether Democrats pick up the 23 seats they need to take control of the U.S. House.\n\nTrump is unpopular in Colorado\u2019s urban congressional districts, and Coffman has labored to distance himself from the president, especially on immigration issues. About 20 percent of the residents in Coffman\u2019s 6th Congressional District, which covers Denver\u2019s eastern and southern suburbs, were born in another country.\n\nWhen Trump said last week that he would revoke birthright citizenship for children born to people in the U.S. illegally, Coffman tweeted: \u201cI hate to break the news to President Trump, but the Supreme Court isn\u2019t going to let him rewrite immigration law by executive fiat, nor should they.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats\u2019 relentless depictions of Coffman as a Trump supporter \u2014 or an ineffective curb on the president \u2014 have dragged down Coffman, said Kyle Saunders, a political science professor at Colorado State University.\n\n\u201cHe was successfully tied to Trump early on through various ad campaigns, whether by Crow as a candidate or by outside spending groups, and he never really recovered,\u201d Saunders said.\n\nCoffman, an Army and Marine veteran who served in both Iraq wars, was first elected in 2008, when his district was comfortably Republican. But its politics shifted before the 2012 election, and Republicans now make up just 30 percent of registered voters, compared with 32 percent who are Democrats and 36 percent unaffiliated.\n\nStill, Coffman kept winning. He got re-elected by 8 percentage points in 2016, when Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won the district by 9 percentage points.\n\nAs the district changed, Coffman did, too. He once supported legislation calling for English-only ballots. Later, he learned Spanish \u2014 even debating in Spanish \u2014 and cultivated close ties with Ethiopian, Hindu and Salvadoran communities, frequently attending services and festivals.\n\nCrow, a former Army Ranger, distinguished himself from Coffman on health care and gun control \u2014 issues dear to constituents.\n\nCoffman opposed former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law but, like many Republicans, says he wants to keep its popular guarantee of coverage for pre-existing conditions.\n\nCrow defended Obama\u2019s health law as a first step toward his goal of universal health care. He called for a federal public insurance option to foster competition among insurers and lower rates.\n\nThe Democrat also blasted the incumbent for taking more National Rifle Association contributions than any other member of Colorado\u2019s House delegation.\n\nThe campaign money favors Crow, who has raised $5.1 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Coffman raised $3.4 million.\n\nIn an ominous sign for Coffman\u2019s chances, a political group affiliated with Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan withdrew its financial support in September. The National Republican Congressional Committee pulled out in October.\n\nThe race is by far the most competitive among Colorado\u2019s seven congressional districts, and incumbents elsewhere are expected to win. Republicans currently hold a 4-3 edge in the state\u2019s congressional delegation.\n\nNone of Colorado\u2019s other congressional districts appears in danger of switching parties, including a seat left open when incumbent Democrat Jared Polis entered the governor\u2019s race. Democrat Joe Neguse faces Republican Peter Yu in the 2nd District, dominated by Boulder and Fort Collins.\n\nIn the other House races:\n\n\u2014 Incumbent Democrat Diana DeGette faces Republican Charles Casper Stockham in the Denver-based 1st District.\n\n\u2014 GOP Rep. Scott Tipton faces Democrat Diane Mitsch Bush, a former state lawmaker, in the 3rd District, covering all of western Colorado and reaching southeast to Pueblo.\n\n\u2014 Incumbent Republican Ken Buck is running against Democrat Karen McCormick in the 4th District, encompassing Greeley, most of Longmont and the state\u2019s eastern Plains.\n\n\u2014 Incumbent Republican Doug Lamborn faces Democrat Stephany Rose Spaulding in the 5th District, dominated by Colorado Springs.\n\n\u2014 Incumbent Democrat Ed Perlmutter faces a challenge from Republican Mark Barrington in the 7th District, another suburban Denver district.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "A man walks by the screen showing the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) at the Korea Exchange in Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

He continued to criticize Stabenow as a career politician who does not have what it takes.\n\nStabenow, speaking at a canvass kickoff in Madison Heights, accused James of being with Trump \u201c2,000 percent\u201d and said \u201cwho we are as Americans\u201d is on the ballot. \u201cWe reject the racism, the hatred, the bigotry,\u201d said Stabenow, who had led in polling.\n\nMichigan\u2019s election also features closely watched congressional races, contests that will determine control of the GOP-led Legislature and battles for two other top offices opening due to term limits: attorney general and secretary of state.

(AP) \u2014 Once pegged as a low-thrill election cycle without major statewide races, North Carolina\u2019s campaign season became a high-intensity fight over Republican governance in Raleigh and Washington, and whether Democrats deserve more power.\n\nRecord numbers voted early before Tuesday\u2019s midterms, reflecting the energy and money injected into legislative, judicial and congressional races and ballot questions.\n\nState Democrats raised mammoth sums of cash, buoyed by Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s call to \u201cBreak the Majority\u201d of the GOP in both the House and Senate this decade. Appraisals of state Republican control stretched to a state Supreme Court race and six referendums that if approved would imprint GOP policies in the state constitution. Three GOP congressional seats were also threatened with close races.\n\nLEGISLATURE\n\nAll General Assembly seats are on ballots. Democrats angry with Republican policies on public schools, taxes, the judiciary and social issues are focusing on this year\u2019s election at a minimum as a step toward regaining General Assembly control.\n\nRepublicans currently hold 75 of the 120 House seats and 35 of the 50 Senate seats. Democrats would need to pick up at least four House seats or six Senate seats to end the GOP\u2019s veto-proof margins and give more leverage to Cooper to pass his initiatives, like expanding Medicaid and curbing school choice options.\n\nTo regain outright majorities for the first time since 2011, Democrats would need to win 16 more House seats overall and 11 Senate seats.\n\nCooper raised at least $7 million for the state Democratic Party, which passed money along to the party\u2019s legislative candidates. Republican campaigns have highlighted the strong economy, passing lower taxes and increasing school spending and teacher raises. While many House Republican incumbents got outraised by Democratic challengers, Senate Republicans fared better.\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS\n\nThe six amendments Republican lawmakers submitted to voters filled the vacuum of having no races for governor or U.S. Senate. Groups for or against the amendments raised well over $20 million, according to campaign finance reports.\n\nFour proposals have gotten the most attention \u2014 amendments that would require photo identification to vote, lower the cap on income tax rates and shift power over filling judicial vacancies and the election board from the governor to the legislature. Others would expand crime victims\u2019 rights and enshrine the right to hunt and fish.\n\nCooper, the Democratic Party and allied groups have pushed to defeat all six. The state GOP backs all six, but former Republican governors and the conservative Americans for Prosperity have come out against one or two individual amendments.\n\nAPPEALS COURTS\n\nVoters will make choices for four seats in the state\u2019s judiciary \u2014 one on the Supreme Court and three on the Court of Appeals \u2014 in addition to scores of local judgeships.\n\nFor the Supreme Court, Democrat Anita Earls seeks to unseat Republican Associate Justice Barbara Jackson. Earls, a longtime civil rights attorney from Durham, raised record campaign money and garnered national attention.\n\nJackson is seeking a second eight-year term but got waylaid by the late entry of another registered Republican, Raleigh attorney Chris Anglin. He had been a registered Democrat until just before he filed. Should Earls win, Democrats would hold five of the seven Supreme Court seats.\n\nCONGRESS\n\nRepublicans hold a 10-3 seat advantage in the state\u2019s congressional delegation.\n\nThe most likely district to flip would be in the south-central 9th District anchored by Charlotte, where Democrat Dan McCready has outraised Republican Mark Harris, who upset current Rep. Robert Pittenger in the GOP primary in May.\n\nIn the 13th District, covering parts of Greensboro and points west to Iredell County, first-term Republican Rep. Ted Budd is trying to fend off a challenge by Kathy Manning. In the Raleigh-area 2nd District, Democrat Linda Coleman is seeking to unseat three-term GOP Rep. George Holding.\n\nRaces for nine other districts favor incumbents, while 3rd District Rep. Walter Jones Jr. faced no ballot opposition.\n\nEARLY VOTING\n\nEarly in-person voting levels smashed the previous record high for midterms in 2014 with several days to spare in this year\u2019s 18-day period. But it\u2019s unclear how much front-loaded voting will translate to higher overall turnout when all mail-absentee ballots and those cast Tuesday in 2,700 precincts statewide are counted.\n\nThe state elections board counted 1.97 million people voting at early-voting sites statewide before they closed Saturday, compared to 1.1 million in 2014, when 10 days of early voting occurred.\n\nOverall 2014 election turnout was 44 percent, or 2.9 million voters. There are now nearly 7.1 million registered voters.", "FILE- In this Nov. 2, 2018, file photo former President Barack Obama, center, raises arms with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, left, and U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., at a campaign rally, in Miami. Florida voters on Tuesday will elect a U.S. senator, a new governor, three Cabinet members and several new members of Congress while deciding to support or approve 12 proposed changes to the state's constitution. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky, File)\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida voters on Tuesday will elect a U.S. senator, a new governor, three Cabinet members and several new members of Congress while deciding to support or approve 12 proposed changes to the state\u2019s constitution.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the choices facing Florida on Election Day.\n\nGOVERNOR\n\nRepublican former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis is facing Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum in one of the closest watched \u2014 and improbable \u2014 governor races in the country. Both began the year as underdogs against better-known and better-funded opponents.\n\nDeSantis built his name recognition with more than 100 appearances on Fox News, then won the primary over Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam by 20 points based mostly on President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement. Gillum shocked political observers by winning the primary in a crowded field. Of the five major candidates, he spent the least and had little presence on television.\n\nDeSantis has run a largely negative campaign, accusing Gillum of corruption and being a failed mayor. Trump visited Florida twice in the final six days of the election to help build turnout for DeSantis.\n\nGillum has run a largely positive campaign, rarely mentioning DeSantis while promising to expand health care, protect the environment and raise corporate taxes to boost education spending. Former President Barack Obama and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders campaigned for him in the final week before the election.\n\nU.S. SENATE\n\nRepublican Gov. Rick Scott is challenging three-term Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson.\n\nIt is Nelson\u2019s toughest election year since winning office in 2000. Scott, who can\u2019t seek re-election because of term limits, had pumped more than $60 million of his own money into the campaign heading into the final week of the race.\n\nIt\u2019s been a largely negative campaign, with Scott depicting Nelson as a confused, empty-suit politician who has achieved little in his time in Washington. Nelson has criticized Scott as an untrustworthy Trump supporter who has used the governor\u2019s office to increase his wealth.\n\nPolls have showed a tight race, and if Scott beats Nelson, there\u2019s almost no chance Democrats can regain control of the Senate.\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nRepublican Ashley Moody and Democratic state Rep. Sean Shaw face off in the race to replace Republican Attorney General Pam Bondi. Moody is a former judge and federal prosecutor from the Tampa area who has criticized Shaw\u2019s lack of experience in the courtroom. Shaw would be Florida\u2019s first black attorney general. The 40-year-old from Tampa is the son of the late state Supreme Court Justice Leander Shaw. He campaigned as a consumer advocate and called for new gun restrictions.\n\nCHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER\n\nRepublican Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis is hoping to keep the seat he was appointed to fill when Republican CFO Jeff Atwater left office early. He is being challenged by former Democratic Sen. Jeremy Ring. Patronis served eight years in the state House before being appointed by Scott to the board that regulates the state\u2019s utilities. He was appointed chief financial officer in June 2017. Ring is a former Yahoo executive from Broward County. He served in the state Senate from 2006 to 2016.\n\nAGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER\n\nRepublican state Rep. Matt Caldwell faces Democratic lobbyist and lawyer Nikki Fried in the race to replace Putnam. Caldwell is a real estate appraiser and seventh generation Floridian who served as chairman of the House Government Accountability Committee. He served eight years in the House. Fried based a large part of her campaign advocating for the medical marijuana industry and criticizing the state\u2019s implementation of a constitutional amendment approved by voters that allows medical use of marijuana in Florida. Fried would be the first woman elected as Florida agriculture commissioner.\n\nCONGRESS\n\nFlorida will elect at least four new members of Congress. DeSantis gave up his seat to run for governor and Republican U.S. Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Tom Rooney and Dennis Ross are retiring. Several incumbents are also facing competitive challenges.\n\nPerhaps the best chance Democrats have of flipping a Republican seat is the District 27 seat now held by Ros-Lehtinen. Democrat Donna Shalala served as President Bill Clinton\u2019s Health and Human Services secretary and as University of Miami president. Republican Maria Elvira Salazar is a television journalist who worked for Spanish language networks.\n\nDemocrats also hope they can pick up DeSantis\u2019 District 6 seat. The party\u2019s nominee is Nancy Soderberg, a former United Nations ambassador and member of Clinton\u2019s National Security Council. She faces Republican businessman and former Army Lt. Col. Michael Waltz, who has appeared frequently on Fox News to discuss military issues.\n\n\u2014Republican state Rep. Ross Spano faces Democrat Kristen Carlson for the District 15 seat held by U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross. Carlson is a former prosecutor who also served as the general counsel for the Florida Department of Citrus.\n\n\u2014Republican state Sen. Greg Steube faces Democrat Allen Ellison for Rooney\u2019s District 17 seat. Ellison replaced April Freeman on the ballot when she died after winning the primary.\n\n\u2014Republicans are targeting the District 7 seat held by first-term U.S. Rep. Stephanie Murphy. She faces Republican state Rep. Mike Miller.\n\n\u2014In District 26, Democrats are targeting Republican U.S Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who faces Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. Mucarsel-Powell has worked for several nonprofit organizations in Miami-Dade County.\n\n\u2014Freshman Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Mast is facing a challenge from Democrat Lauren Baer, who was a senior adviser to Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.\n\n\u2014Eight-term Republican U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart is being challenged by Democratic former judge Mary Barzee Flores.\n\nBALLOT QUESTIONS\n\nFlorida will have 12 proposed constitutional amendments on the ballot, all which need 60 percent approval to pass. They number 1-7 and 9-13 after the state Supreme Court removed Amendment 8 from the ballot.\n\nAmendment 4 could have a long-lasting impact on the state\u2019s politics. It would automatically restore the voting rights of felons who complete their sentences. It would not apply to murderers and rapists. More than 1.5 million ex-felons can\u2019t vote in Florida, and critics of the state\u2019s felon voting ban say it disproportionally affects minority voters who tend to support Democrats.\n\nAmendment 13 would ban dog racing in Florida by 2021, which would be a blow to the industry that\u2019s been dwindling over the past two decades. Only five other states have active dog racing.\n\nAmendment 3 would require statewide voter approval to expand casino gambling in Florida. If passed, it would take the expansion of gambling out of the hands of the Legislature.\n\nHere are the remaining ballot questions:\n\n\u2014 Amendment 1 would increase the state\u2019s property tax homestead exemption from $50,000 to as much as $75,000 on homes worth more than $100,000\n\n\u2014 Amendment 2 would permanently keep in place a 10 percent cap on property tax assessments for commercial and rental properties that is current law, but is set to expire next year.\n\n\u2014 Amendment 5 would require a two-thirds majority vote before the Legislature could increase taxes or fees.\n\n\u2014 Amendment 6 would provide additional rights to crime victims and would raise the mandatory retirement age for judges from 70 to 75.\n\n\u2014 Amendment 7 would require a supermajority vote before state university boards of trustees can raise fees. It would also pay death benefits, including help with education expenses, to the survivors of first responders who die on the job.\n\n\u2014 Amendment 9 would prohibit oil drilling in state waters and ban vaping in work places where smoking is already prohibited.\n\n\u2014 Amendment 10 would require the state to create an Office of Domestic Security and Counter-Terrorism and maintain a Department of Veterans Affairs, which already exists. It would set the start of the annual legislative session to January instead of March in even-numbered years and require counties to elect a sheriff, tax collector, property appraiser, elections supervisor and circuit court clerk.\n\n\u2014 Amendment 11 would allow the Legislature to make some changes to criminal laws retroactive. It would also repeal language in the constitution that\u2019s now considered obsolete.\n\n\u2014 Amendment 12 would ban elected officials, agency heads, judges and others from paid lobbying while serving and for six years after leaving office instead of the current two.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Italian Finance Minister Giovanni Tria, right, talks to European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici prior to a meeting of Eurogroup Finance Ministers at the European Council headquarters in Brussels, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018.

Above all, the European Commission is extending a hand to Italy and I would like Italy to grasp that hand.\u201d\n\nItaly\u2019s debt load is the second highest in Europe, after Greece. Many are concerned about financial turmoil in Europe if Italy loses control of its finances, but the government says a sharp increase in spending is needed to jumpstart economic growth.\n\nItaly has Europe\u2019s fourth-largest economy and the bloc would struggle to bail it out.\n\nEU Economy Commissioner Pierre Moscovici recalled that Italy has until Nov. 13 to submit a new budget plan. The European Commission will rule on that plan, as well as the others in Europe, on Nov. 21.\n\n\u201cWhen a member does not respect the rules it has an impact on the others,\u201d Moscovici said.\n\nAsked whether some deal or compromise could be found between Brussels and Rome, Moscovici said: \u201cNo. We\u2019re not in a negotiation. We\u2019re not in a discussion.

EU countries have agreed to allow the commission to supervise their budget plans and take legal steps against those who refuse. But countries still determine their spending priorities and Italy\u2019s government appears determined to go its own way.\n\nDutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra backed the budget supervision process but he would not speculate about what Italy might do or what response might be needed if it refuses to submit a new plan.\n\n\u201cThis is a dialogue between the Commission and Italy. The Commission has rejected the Italian budget. It is now up to Italy to respond,\u201d he told reporters.", "Suspect killed in confrontation with Albuquerque police\n\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M.

(AP) \u2014 Republican Kevin Cramer and Democrat Heidi Heitkamp were finishing their Senate race Monday with a flurry of campaigning in North Dakota\u2019s capital city and across the state.\n\nThe race has big stakes for the state and the nation, with Republicans banking on it to help retain control of the Senate. Incumbent Sen. Heitkamp, who is seeking her second term, is seen as one of the most vulnerable senators among red-state Democrats.\n\nHeitkamp was making stops Monday in Bismarck, Minot, Belcourt, Grand Forks and Fargo, where she will be Election Day. Heitkamp voted last week in Mandan, where she lives.\n\nCramer voted early on Monday in Bismarck and will remain there until the votes are tallied Tuesday. He told reporters he was personally calling voters and doing several radio and television interviews Monday.\n\nCramer said he thinks he\u2019s leading Heitkamp but that the race is closer than polls suggest.\n\nCramer said he remembers when Heitkamp was down in most polling on the day before she defeated Rick Berg six years ago by fewer than 2,000 votes.\n\n\u201cI feel pretty confident,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cBut I expect this race is closer than the polling has demonstrated.\u201d\n\nHeitkamp said in a statement that \u201cpollsters underestimated the independence of North Dakotans\u201d six years ago.\n\n\u201cJust like in 2012, the wind is at our back in this race,\u201d her statement said.\n\nCampaign finance disclosures show Heitkamp has raised more than $27 million in her re-election bid, or five times that of her opponent.\n\nSecretary of State Al Jaeger said more than 135,000 North Dakota residents had already cast ballots by Monday morning, nearly equal to the total turnout in the June primary.\n\nVoters also will choose a new U.S. House member to replace Cramer. GOP State Sen. Kelly Armstrong of Dickinson is facing Democrat Mac Schneider, a businessman and attorney. He served in the state Senate from 2009 until his defeat for re-election in 2016. Armstrong is a lawyer and the former chairman of the state Republican Party.\n\nThe other statewide races on the ballot are attorney general, secretary of state, public service commissioner, tax commissioner and agriculture commissioner \u2014 all jobs now held by Republicans.\n\nVoters will also see several ballot measures, including one to legalize recreational marijuana just two years after they said yes to medical marijuana. Another would amend the state constitution to enact several ethics measures, including banning foreign money in elections and creating an independent ethics commission. A third would explicitly block noncitizens from voting, even though it is already illegal for them to vote.", "TACOMA, Wash.

(AP) \u2014 Virginia voters will make their picks Tuesday in several competitive congressional races that could help determine control of the U.S. House as well as a special state House election that will decide the balance of power in the Virginia House of Delegates.\n\nVoters will also cast ballots in a U.S. Senate contest between Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine and Republican challenger Corey Stewart.\n\nPolls will be open 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Each voter will need to bring a photo ID. Valid forms of identification include a driver\u2019s license, passport or student ID. A voter who forgets ID can cast a provisional ballot but will have to complete follow-up steps to ensure that it\u2019s counted.\n\nAnyone not already registered won\u2019t be able to vote.

Tim Kaine and Republican Corey Stewart, a firebrand supporter of President Donald Trump.\n\nKaine is the heavy favorite to win. He\u2019s had large leads in most polls and has enjoyed a massive cash advantage to finance advertising and get out the vote efforts.\n\nStewart has been all but abandoned by national Republicans and the White House. Best known for his outspoken support of Confederate monuments and hardline views on immigration, Stewart has focused heavily on attacking Kaine personally.\n\nKaine, who was Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate during her unsuccessful 2016 presidential run, has emphasized inclusivity in his campaign and centered his message on a \u201cVirginia that works for all.\u201d\n\n___\n\nHOUSE DISTRICT 10\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Barbara Comstock, who represents this Northern Virginia district, has long been considered one of the most vulnerable incumbents in Congress.\n\nThe district includes many wealthy suburban voters who dislike Trump. Hillary Clinton won the district by 10 percentage points, and Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam won by 11.\n\nComstock has tried hard to emphasis her independence from Trump. She easily beat a Democrat in 2016 when her district went for Clinton.\n\nComstock is facing Jennifer Wexton, a former prosecutor and current Democratic state senator.\n\n___\n\nHOUSE DISTRICT 2\n\nThis Hampton Roads-area seat is another swing district with a vulnerable Republican. GOP U.S. Rep. Scott Taylor is seeking a second term in a district Northam won by four percentage points. The former Navy SEAL is running against Democrat Elaine Luria, a U.S. Naval Academy graduate who spent 20 years on active duty.\n\nThe race was marked by a ballot-fraud scandal that tainted Taylor\u2019s campaign. Some of Taylor\u2019s staff members were accused of forging voters\u2019 signatures to help place a third-party \u201cspoiler candidate\u201d on the ballot.\n\n___\n\nHOUSE DISTRICT 7\n\nTwo-term Republican U.S. Rep. Dave Brat is trying to hold to a seat in a Richmond-area district that has been held by Republicans since 1971. He\u2019s facing former CIA officer and political newcomer Abigail Spanberger.\n\nBrat has touted the strong economy and tax cuts under Trump and has portrayed Spanberger as a radical liberal and often compared her to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nBrat scored a huge upset four years ago when he defeated then-U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Spanberger cast herself as a moderate during the race and slammed Brat for being out of touch with voters in the district.\n\n___\n\nHOUSE DISTRICT 5\n\nThis is another district Republicans are trying to hold on to. The district stretches from northern Virginia hunt country through Charlottesville down to southside Virginia and the North Carolina line.\n\nThe seat is currently held by first-term Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Garrett, who ended his re-election bid in May after announcing he planned to seek treatment for alcoholism.\n\nDistillery owner and Air Force veteran Denver Riggleman, a Republican, is facing off Democrat Leslie Cockburn, a former investigative journalist and producer for \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\n___\n\nHOUSE OF DELEGATES SPECIAL ELECTION\n\nVirginia state House elections are normally held on off years, but the retirement of Del.

Scott Walker, left, and his Democratic challenger Tony Evers in the 2018 November general election. (Wisconsin State Journal via AP, File)\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 The tossup contest for governor of Wisconsin is ending with Republican Gov. Scott Walker and Democratic opponent Tony Evers making last-minute pitches on the issues that largely drove the race from the beginning: health care, taxes and the economy.\n\nWalker and Evers joined other candidates across the state Monday making their closing arguments in final campaign stops and on social media. Both sides were ending the campaigns where their base of support is strongest: Evers and other Democrats in Madison, Walker and Republicans in Waukesha.\n\nPolls Tuesday open statewide starting at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m.\n\nAlso on the ballot, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin faces Republican Leah Vukmir; Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel squares off against Democratic attorney Josh Kaul; Democrat Randy Bryce faces Republican Bryan Steil in the race to replace House Speaker Paul Ryan in southeastern Wisconsin; and Republican control of the state Assembly and Senate is up for grabs with races all across the state.\n\nWalker cast the decision as being about pocketbook issues.\n\n\u201cWhile \u2018everything is on the table\u2019 for Evers when it comes to raising taxes \u2014 including property, income and gas taxes \u2014 our plans will continue to cut taxes and keep #WIWorking,\u201d Walker tweeted Monday.\n\nIn the past week, Evers has said he won\u2019t raise taxes even as he remains open to a higher gas tax to spend more on roads and wants to nearly eliminate a manufacturing and agriculture tax credit program. He would use the $300 million in savings to lower personal property taxes for the middle class.\n\nEvers, the state schools superintendent, also said his education department budget request would not raise property taxes while increasing state funding for schools by nearly $1.7 billion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m planning on raising no taxes,\u201d Evers said in an interview Sunday on WISN-TV, repeating a claim he first made last week to the Washington Post.\n\nBut Evers has not explained how that promise comports with his willingness to raise the gas tax or promising to end the manufacturing and agriculture tax credit program for those who earn more than $300,000, which would increase taxes for them.\n\nWalker argued that Evers\u2019 proposals would increase income and property taxes while also repeatedly asserting that Evers would raise the gas tax by as much as a dollar a gallon. Evers calls that ridiculous, but he has not said how much he would be willing to increase the 32.9-cent per-gallon gas tax.\n\nEvers has largely focused on health care, saying Walker\u2019s longtime disdain for the Affordable Care Act shows he can\u2019t be trusted to do what\u2019s best for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nWalker last week broadened his promise on protecting health insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, saying he wants to enact the \u201cexact same language\u201d at the state level that\u2019s in the federal law.\n\nHowever, a more limited state protection failed in the state Senate this year and Republican leaders of the Legislature have not commented on Walker\u2019s new, broader proposal.\n\nAlso, any state law would not protect as many people because only the federal government can regulate self-funded plans. That means people insured by more than 150 companies in Wisconsin would lose the guarantees of coverage for pre-existing conditions if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.\n\nWalker this year also authorized the state to join a lawsuit seeking repeal of the federal law. Walker has insisted that he\u2019s not reversing himself.\n\nEvers told a crowd in Beloit that he wanted to be governor to \u201csolve problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to Madison to go someplace else,\u201d the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Evers saying, a dig at Walker\u2019s failed run for president in 2016. \u201cThat frustrates people sometimes \u2014 \u2018well, is Evers a moderate or is he a liberal?\u2019 Frankly, I don\u2019t care.

Thousands of his supporters have been keeping vigil.\n\nSupporters of Rajapaksa at the rally chanted \u201cWhose power is this? Mahinda\u2019s power!\u201d\n\nAs patriotic songs blared over loudspeakers, thousands shuffled through heavy rain toward a makeshift stage. Police and Sri Lankan special forces with semi-automatic rifles stood guard.\n\nPolice estimated 120,000 people attended the rally. State television reported there were at least 200,000.\n\nPradeep Kariyawasam, the head of Rajapaksa\u2019s party in Colombo, said that although Wickremesinghe continues to maintain he is the country\u2019s legitimate leader, \u201cthe people are with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive people a chance to choose their government and not hide behind constitutional interpretations,\u201d he said.\n\nSirisena and Rajapaksa arrived at the rally amid loud cheers.\n\nSirisena told the crowd that the change he initiated was more than a personnel shift.\n\n\u201cI ousted a vision that is incompatible with our local culture and values, and that works according to foreign agendas,\u201d Sirisena said.\n\n\u201cFor the past 3 \u00bd years, poor people were suppressed by Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s economic and political vision. Local thoughts were rejected and an extreme neo-liberal form of governance was carried out.\u201d\n\nHe was referring to Wickremesinghe\u2019s free-market economic policies and public-private partnerships with companies from China and India to operate strategic centers such as ports and airports.\n\nRajapaksa supporters have accused Wickremesinghe of selling Sri Lanka\u2019s assets, citing a 99-year lease agreement his government struck with Hong Kong conglomerate China Merchants Port Holdings Co. Ltd. last year to operate a failing port developed with Chinese debt during Rajapaksa\u2019s decadelong presidency.\n\n\u201cForeign countries are trying to take our resources, take our land,\u201d said Mithra Kumara Jayasinghe, a wedding photographer at the rally who said he had voted for Rajapaksa the two times he was elected president, in 2005 and 2010, and when he lost a re-election bid in 2015.\n\nCritics of Sirisena\u2019s actions say Parliament was suspended to give Rajapaksa time to gather enough support to survive a no-confidence vote when lawmakers reconvene Nov. 14.\n\nParliament Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said on Monday that he won\u2019t recognize the new appointments until either side is able to prove it has a majority. It means that the speaker still recognizes a Wickremesinghe-led Parliament.\n\n\u201cI wish to emphasize that I am compelled to accept the status that existed previously until such time that they (the pro-Wickremesinghe lawmakers) and the new political alliance prove their majority in Parliament,\u201d he said.\n\nThe statement was fuel at Rajapaksa\u2019s five-hour rally. Lawmaker Susil Premjayantha told the crowd that electing a new speaker could be the first order of business when Parliament reopens, suggesting the party will bring a no-confidence motion against Jayasuriya.\n\nWickremesinghe said in an interview with The Associated Press last week that there is credible evidence that Rajapaksa\u2019s party is attempting to buy support in Parliament. Palitha Range Bandara, a United National Party lawmaker, has said that he was offered millions of dollars and a minister portfolio if he crossed over.\n\nLawmakers from Rajapaksa\u2019s party have denied the allegations.\n\nSeven members of Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Front have defected to Rajapaksa\u2019s government.\n\nOn Saturday, the Tamil National Alliance \u2014 an ethnic minority Tamil party \u2014 said it will support a no-confidence motion to be brought against Rajapaksa, after one lawmaker from their party joined Rajapaksa\u2019s government.\n\nThe Tamil party\u2019s 15 votes could give Wickremesinghe\u2019s camp a decisive edge over Rajapaksa.\n\nBoth Sirisena and Rajapaksa attempted to woo Tamil lawmakers in their speeches at the rally.\n\nSpeaking in the Tamil language, Rajapaksa promised to fulfill the Tamil people\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201cWhat I ask from all Tamil and (Tamil-speaking) Muslim people and their political parties is to help to build up our country. I trust you and you can always trust me,\u201d Rajapaksa said.\n\nEthnic minority Tamils in the country\u2019s north and east are still reeling from the effects of a 26-year civil war between Tamil Tiger separatists and government troops.\n\nRajapaksa is seen as a hero by the ethnic Sinhalese majority for winning the conflict.\n\nTens of thousands of civilians were reportedly killed in the final months of the war in 2009, when government troops brutally crushed the rebels. Thousands more are still missing.\n\nSirisena came into power in 2015 promising to address the issues affecting the Tamils and investigate allegations of war crimes against both sides of the conflict, but has done little in either area. He was also critical of investigations into military personnel accused of human rights violations during the civil war.\n\nAmong the crowd Monday was Basil Ros, 58, a fisherman from the village of Negombo.\n\nRos said a local lawmaker from Rajapaksa\u2019s United People\u2019s Freedom Alliance bused him and his wife in with many others, pledging to give them 1,000 rupees (about $5.80), food and alcohol.\n\nHe said he hadn\u2019t received any money yet.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t trust politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might pay; they might not.\u201d\n\nAfter sacking Wickremesinghe, Sirisena announced that he made the replacement in part because Wickremesinghe and a Cabinet colleague were behind an alleged assassination plot against him.\n\nDetails of the alleged plot have not been disclosed and Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied the accusation.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister.\n\nSirisena said at the rally that he would not be discouraged by resistance in Parliament, civil society and the international community to his actions.\n\n\u201cEven if there are threats, pressure and forces, I will only move forward and will not take a step back,\u201d he said.", "SAN ANTONIO (AP) \u2014 Mitchell Lake served for decades as a big, stinky holding pond for San Antonio\u2019s sewage, but now it is considered a hidden gem on the South Side as a refuge for hundreds of bird species.\n\nThe San Antonio Express-News reports owls, roadrunners, sandpipers, herons, hawks, pelicans and even whooping cranes, an endangered species, live at the 1,200-acre natural area or have been spotted there as they migrate.\n\nSoon, the area will be the site of a yearlong pilot program to find out whether restoration of wetlands at the lake could improve its water quality.\n\nOne key concern is the algae at the bottom of the 600-acre shallow lake. The algae increases nitrogen and diminishes dissolved oxygen that is critical to fish and other wildlife during heavy rains. The water flows south into the Medina and San Antonio rivers.\n\nThe algae built up over time. The city acquired the lake in 1901 and began pumping sewage into it through an open ditch. That continued after a wastewater plant was built in the 1930s. The Legislature ordered a cleanup of the lake in 1973. Dikes and basins were built, and sewage discharges were discontinued in 1987.\n\nThe lake, now part of the San Antonio Water System, is still regulated as a federally and state-permitted wastewater treatment plant, SAWS President and CEO Robert Puente said. The state considers it a violation, because of the elevated nitrogen levels, when water spills over a dam on the south end of the lake.\n\nSAWS considered several possible solutions to the water quality problem, including raising the dam, building a wastewater treatment plant at the lake or dredging it.\n\nBecause of the lake\u2019s conversion in recent decades into a haven for waterfowl and \u201ca jewel of San Antonio,\u201d SAWS opted to seek a natural solution, Puente said.\n\nUnder the pilot program, set to begin early next year, 1.8 acres at the southwest corner of the lake will be replanted with cattails and other aquatic plants. Those could help reduce the algae and nitrogen, as directed by the federal Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\u201cIt could turn out that it doesn\u2019t work. We think that it should,\u201d said Sam Mills, special projects director at SAWS.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers allocated $1.5 million for the test project. If it proves successful, SAWS plans to modify the dam to manually control spillway flows. That would allow water to continually feed up to 120 acres of potential wetlands south of the dam, typically at depths of 6 inches to 2 feet, providing cleaner water as it moves downstream.\n\nNearly 350 bird species have been documented at the lake, which dates to at least 1764, when a Spanish map indicated a body of water at the site.\n\nThe nonprofit Mitchell Lake Audubon Center, part of the National Audubon Society, operates the natural area under a contract with SAWS and offers tours and classes.\n\nOver time, hiking trails, bridges, a visitors center and restrooms have been added.\n\nU.S. Reps.

Also running are Green Party candidate Demitri Theodoropoulos, a record store owner in Newark, and Libertarian candidate Nadine Frost, a political activist who ran for Wilmington city council two years ago.\n\nU.S. HOUSE\n\nIncumbent Democrat Lisa Blunt Rochester, the first black and first woman elected to Congress from Delaware, is seeking a second term as the state\u2019s lone representative in the U.S. House. She is being challenged by Republican Scott Walker, a businessman who ran for Congress two years ago as a Democrat and has been disavowed by the state GOP for his controversial statements.\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nDemocrat Kathleen Jennings, a former state prosecutor who also held the number-two job in Delaware\u2019s Department of Justice, is now vying to become attorney general. Her Republican opponent is Bernard Pepukayi, a longtime Democrat who switched parties and filed for the office after the lone GOP candidate abruptly quit the race. Incumbent Democrat Matt Denn opted not to seek re-election.\n\nTREASURER\n\nRepublican Ken Simpler is seeking a second four-year term as state treasurer, an office that has been used in the past as a stepping stone to higher office. Simpler, who has a long background in the finance industry, is being challenged by Democratic newcomer Colleen Davis, a health care industry consultant.\n\nAUDITOR\n\nIncumbent Republican Tom Wagner\u2019s decision to retire for health reasons has given Democrats the chance to claim the state auditor\u2019s office for the first time since 1989, when Wagner first took office. Democrat Kathleen McGuiness, a businesswoman and longtime Rehoboth Beach commissioner, is vying for the seat against Republican James Spadola, a military veteran and former Newark police officer who has an MBA degree and a background in finance. Less than three weeks before Tuesday\u2019s election, Wagner appointed Spadola to fill the vacant post of deputy auditor, drawing complaints from Democrats of political favoritism and partisanship.\n\nDELAWARE SENATE\n\nDemocrats currently control the Delaware Senate by a narrow 11-10 margin, but Republicans are hoping to regain control of the chamber for the first time since Richard Nixon was president. Republicans have a chance to unseat two incumbent Democrats in northern Delaware but are setting their sights on a seat in central Delaware left open by a Democratic lawmaker\u2019s retirement. That race pits Republican Justin King, a businessman and mayor of Camden, against Democrat Charles \u201cTrey\u201d Paradee III, a financial adviser who gave up his state House seat to run for Senate.\n\nDELAWARE HOUSE\n\nAll 41 seats in the state House are on the ballot, but 13 candidates, roughly a third of the total, face no opposition and are guaranteed to take the oath of office.\n\nVOTING\n\nPolls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.", "COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Police says the bodies of a man and woman have been found in a parked minivan in Ohio and a man has been charged with murder in the slayings.\n\nColumbus police say the bodies were found Sunday afternoon in a Columbus neighborhood and the man and woman appeared to have been beaten. Police say cause of death and positive identifications for the two will have to be confirmed by the Franklin County Coroner\u2019s Office.\n\nCourt records show 54-year-old John H. Jordan, of Columbus, has been arrested on murder charges in both deaths. The records don\u2019t indicate whether the Columbus man has an attorney yet.\n\nPolice did not comment on any potential motive.", "Des Moines Register. November 2, 2018\n\nParticipating in democracy is a family value. Iowa parents can show its importance.\n\nParents teach children to brush their teeth, tie shoelaces, drive cars and open bank accounts. We share with them our religious beliefs and values. We tell them to be nice to others, wear seat belts and get to work on time.\n\nThe midterm elections represent an opportunity to teach our kids to be active participants in our democracy. If you haven\u2019t already voted early or absentee, take your kids with you to vote on Tuesday.\n\nYoung kids can accompany their parents to polling places. The experience helps them understand that each person plays a role in our electorate and that voting is not a daunting process.\n\nIf you have an adult child, help make sure they get to the polls to vote themselves. Or help persuade friends who are on the fence about voting. It doesn\u2019t matter if they haven\u2019t registered. Iowa allows same-day registration, meaning qualified residents can register and vote on Tuesday. (Most states require voters to register by a deadline generally falling between 8 and 30 days before Election Day.)\n\nThose seeking to register will need to prove identity and where they live. The best option is a valid Iowa driver\u2019s license with their current address, but there are other options for qualifying documents listed on the Iowa Secretary of State\u2019s website.\n\nPart of the \u201cfear factor\u201d for voters of all ages is the feeling of being unprepared to choose the right candidates. Parents can download sample ballots from their county auditor\u2019s website and have children help them research unfamiliar candidates before heading to the polls. Helping parents do their \u201chomework\u201d will help youngsters understand the responsibilities of citizenship.\n\nOf course, participating in a democracy is about more than just voting, and Election Day offers an occasion to talk with your children about government. Help them make connections between the actions of lawmakers and school safety, climate change, the cost of college and access to health care. Explain that taxes are not evil, but the way to fund schools, roads and parks. Encourage them to read newspapers, news websites and other credible source of information, think critically and form educated opinions on issues and candidates.\n\nLike young people all over the country, many students across Iowa walked out of school earlier this year to protest gun violence.\n\nThe protests were an exercise of their First Amendment rights. But achieving change takes more than joining a fired-up rally of their peers.\n\nThe rest of us have a responsibility to help young people understand the best way to speak up about government is by casting a ballot, and that ballot helps decide who lands in office and who crafts the policies and laws that affect all of our lives.\n\nIn the spirit of making voting a family activity, Iowans can also take their elderly relatives to the polls. Any voter who needs help marking a ballot due to a physical disability can bring a person of their choosing to help them. (This individual cannot, however, be an employer, an employer\u2019s agent or an officer/agent of a union). If someone wants help from a precinct election official, two officials (one from each political party) will assist them.\n\nCurbside voting is available for people with disabilities who are unable to enter the building of their polling place. Election officials will come to the car, and a voter can mark the ballot from the vehicle.The Secretary of State\u2019s Office has a handy online Election Day FAQ with useful questions and answers.\n\nNearly 30 percent of the 2.2 million registered Iowa voters did not vote in the 2016 election. All of us can play a part in helping turn out more of our family and friends this year and in years to come.\n\n______\n\nFort Dodge Messenger. November 4, 2018.\n\nMake your voice heard at the polls\n\nThose who vote will help shape the future of the nation\n\nElection Day is almost upon us. On Tuesday, those citizens who choose to vote have the opportunity to shape the future of our community, state and nation. Given the impact American policies have almost everywhere in the world, it is really no exaggeration to say that the voices of this country\u2019s voters are heard all over the planet.\n\nMany of the decisions voters will make that will shape the future of the nation, our state and local communities.\n\nAmazingly, many people choose not to vote. That poses a serious threat to our democratic system. American governmental institutions won\u2019t work as intended if citizens fail to express their preferences by voting.\n\nEven in presidential elections, commentators deem a turnout \u201cgreat\u201d when as many as 70 percent of the eligible voters show up to cast a ballot. In off-year elections, like this one, it is not unusual for well over half those who could have voted to stay away from the polls.\n\nHere in the Hawkeye State there are roughly 2 million registered voters. Unfortunately, it is likely that many of those Iowans who could vote in this year\u2019s election will fail to do so.\n\nMany theories have been advanced to explain why people don\u2019t vote.\n\nSome political scientists say one of the biggest reasons is that nonvoters claim the outcome of elections doesn\u2019t have an impact on their lives. It also is common for people who don\u2019t show up at the polls to justify their choice not to participate by arguing that their vote won\u2019t really matter because so many votes are cast.\n\nIf you are one of those who think that individual voters don\u2019t matter, it may be useful to reflect a bit on history.\n\nIn the 2000 presidential election, if a few more people had showed up to vote in Florida, George W. Bush might now be known primarily for his service as governor of Texas. In 1960, the presidential vote was so close that the outcome was decided by about one vote per precinct nationwide. Right here in Iowa, in the 1998 Democratic primary, Tom Vilsack won his party\u2019s nomination by less than two votes per precinct.\n\nA few nonvoters could have altered subsequent history mightily.\n\nMore troubling is the belief some people hold that who wins will have no impact on them personally.\n\nThat notion may, in part, be the product of living in a country where democratic institutions have been the norm so long that people assume they always will be. The only guarantee that those institutions will survive, however, is citizen vigilance.\n\nOver time, such nonparticipation undermines the legitimacy of the governmental system. It becomes hard to claim that officeholders reflect the will of the public when so many people had no role in their selection.\n\nOn Tuesday (or earlier if one makes use of Iowa\u2019s convenient early voting option), we all have the chance to demonstrate we understand that the right to vote is precious.\n\nDefend your democratic birthright by voting in this year\u2019s election.\n\n___\n\nQuad-City Times. October 30, 2018\n\nKirk, Kinzer, Maxwell right for county board\n\nWhen Carol Earnhardt and Diane Holst decided not to run for re-election to the Scott County Board of Supervisors, that set up a scramble for the three seats on the ballot this year.\n\nOn the Republican ticket are: John Maxwell, of Donahue, a dairy farmer and member of the North Scott School Board; Bettendorf Alderman Scott Webster, a small business owner; and Carla Williams, a former Davenport council member and a social worker and mental health therapist.\n\nOn the Democratic side of the ballot are: Rogers Kirk, a pastor from Bettendorf who has served on a variety of local and statewide boards; Ken Croken of Davenport, who has held a number of executive posts, including at Genesis Health System and currently TAG Communications; and incumbent Supervisor Brinson Kinzer, of Blue Grass, who is a former mayor and works as an electrician.\n\nThe county board generally is considered one of the best run of the local governments in the Quad-Cities. With a relatively low tax rate and few controversies, the board has mostly gone about its business with little attention.\n\nFor the most part, that\u2019s a good thing, though we believe the county could have more convenient meeting times and should move faster to broadcast its proceedings.\n\nWe\u2019ve been impressed with most of what we\u2019ve heard throughout this campaign season. The candidates all seem to realize that providing mental health services is a growing challenge for the county, that keeping taxes low is a goal, as is providing adequate services, and promoting economic development is an important function.\n\nToday, we are endorsing Brinson Kinzer, Rogers Kirk and John Maxwell. We believe that the three of them, with current supervisors Ken Beck and Tony Knobbe, will ably represent all of the parts of Scott County.\n\nIn our discussions with Kinzer, he brought a stay-the-course approach to the board. He is careful with resources but also supportive of the county\u2019s approach to the state legislature on mental health issues, which is to lobby for greater authority to fund these needs. With his experience in city government in Blue Grass and his support of working people, we believe Kinzer deserves another term.\n\nWe have watched Kirk work in our community for years. As the longtime pastor of Third Missionary Baptist Church in Davenport, he has been a positive force for good in the community. Kirk also previously served on the state Board of Parole, an experience we believe would surely be of use in dealing with the issues facing the county jail.\n\nKirk also has been clear he would like to see the board change the time for its Committee of the Whole meeting (currently, 8 a.m.) so more people can attend. That\u2019s a good idea.\n\nWe also were impressed with his concern for shrinking rural parts of the county.\n\nMaxwell\u2019s service on the North Scott School Board and his widely visited dairy farm have given him prominence in the rural part of the county, which is valuable for the board. So is his his view on the preservation of farmland, as economic development grows beyond city borders. His view that expanding the sources of revenue for mental health needs beyond just property taxes, is also welcome, though we believe additional property tax authority in this area will be inevitably needed.\n\nWe also saw in Maxwell someone who will look for efficiencies in how the county is run. Our impression is that Scott County operates pretty lean, but we believe that his business and government experience will be valuable.\n\nAs for the others on the ballot, we\u2019ve seen Ken Croken advocate throughout the campaign for a more robust role for the county board. There is a lot to be said for his view. Croken has rightly pointed out that the Quad-Cities is not growing as fast as other parts of the state.\n\nWe hope he continues to make his voice heard, and not just on the economy but his advocacy for mental health courts, too.\n\nWebster\u2019s attention to budgetary detail, meanwhile, makes him the kind of public official that one would hope for. Too many elected officials just leave it to staff. And Williams has a great deal of knowledge about how mental health issues have an impact in our areas. No matter what happens Nov. 6, we hope she continues to make her voice heard.\n\n____\n\nDubuque Telegraph Herald. November 4, 2018\n\nNo excuse to skip Tuesday\u2019s vote\n\nLooking for reasons to skip voting in Tuesday\u2019s midterm election?\n\nLet us help you count the ways.\n\n. The office of U.S. president is not topping the ballot. (That\u2019s why they are called \u201cmidterm\u201d elections \u2014 the president is midway through his term.)\n\nIf you aren\u2019t weighing in on who will occupy the White House, why bother helping decide who will represent you in the halls of Congress, governor\u2019s office, state legislature or courthouse?\n\nYou aren\u2019t alone if you stay home Tuesday. Barely half the eligible voters in Dubuque County, for example, voted in the past two midterms, compared to more than nearly three-fourths in presidential elections.\n\n. It\u2019s hard to find the time. Being able to cast ballots weeks in advance \u2014 in person or by mail \u2014 or during a 13- or 14-hour period (depending on state of residence) on Election Day? Not good enough. Demonstrate your objection by staying home.\n\n. Showing an ID. Two-thirds of the states have some sort of requirement that voters present IDs at the polls. Wisconsin\u2019s law is considered strict, while Iowa\u2019s new requirement is less so \u2014 and allows voters without IDs to cast provisional ballots and have it sorted out later. Illinois does not require an ID.\n\nWhile we disagree about the necessity of IDs to ensure fair and honest elections, we also note that we\u2019re constantly presenting IDs for other purposes \u2014 from cashing a check to picking up concert tickets to buying a six-pack.\n\nBut having to show an ID to exercise a freedom that people in other countries die for? Well, that is far too much to ask.\n\n. Others will take care of you. No need to vote. Your friends, neighbors, relatives and people across town \u2014 they all think exactly like you. They have the same needs and concerns. Surely, they will vote the same way you would have \u2014 had you gone to the trouble. After all, the \u201cright\u201d candidates always win, correct?\n\nSo, if you need a reason \u2014 let\u2019s call it what it is, an excuse \u2014 not to vote in Election 2018, you can have your pick.\n\nHowever, if you have any interest or concern about who will represent you in elective office, it would be better if you find your ID and find your way to the polls on Tuesday.\n\n____", "Omaha World Herald. November 3, 2018\n\nJoslyn\u2019s plans for a major new building can be a big plus for Omaha as a whole.\n\nOmaha has many positive developments going for it, but it can strengthen itself by nurturing a key ingredient.\n\nThe ingredient: civic ambition \u2014 a striving to stretch our community\u2019s vision for what it can achieve and project about itself to the wider world.\n\nThe Joslyn Art Museum is pursuing such a commendable approach by moving forward with a bold architectural vision. The museum\u2019s ambitious plans should be a major long-term plus for the Joslyn and for Omaha as a whole. To design a major new building on the existing museum property, a Joslyn committee has unanimously picked the Norwegian firm Sn\u00f8hetta, known for its bold architectural visions, in coordination with local architecture firm Alley Poyner Macchietto.\n\n\u201cI think the challenge is a real opportunity to do something that will be unique and respectful to the site,\u201d Joslyn director Jack Becker told World-Herald columnist Matthew Hansen. \u201cSomething that\u2019s engaging to audiences in the 21st century. ... We believe Sn\u00f8hetta can do that.\u201d\n\nSpecifics on the new structure are yet to be decided, but the new structure could become a showplace featuring the notable collection of contemporary art promised to the Joslyn by the Schrager family, Hansen reports. Paul Schrager founded the Pacesetter Corp. in Omaha in 1962.\n\nThe new structure will free up space for displays and arts programming in the museum\u2019s two existing structures.\n\nThe Joslyn has seen an impressive increase in attendance, with a 62 percent increase since 2010, to nearly 200,000 last year. A key factor is the elimination of its entrance fee in 2013, thanks to a grant from the Sherwood Foundation.\n\nBecker says the selection of Sn\u00f8hetta provides an opportunity \u201cto build another iconic structure that becomes part of the identity of Omaha.\u201d Indeed, the Joslyn deserves a salute for seizing this important opportunity for itself and Omaha\u2019s civic future.\n\n_______\n\nNorth Platte Telegraph. November 4, 2018\n\nOn Election Day, we renew faith in our ideals\n\nElections in America are supposed to be sober exercises in which responsible voters, trained in citizenship since childhood, weigh the candidates and the facts and make well-informed choices in the voting booth.\n\nIt\u2019s because we still believe in that venerable ideal that The Telegraph has once more striven to give you the best information possible before you visit the polls on Tuesday.\n\nWe believe in it, even though our nation\u2019s overall and especially recent history urges us to dismiss it as foolish and naive.\n\nOur Founding Fathers faced the same temptation. They were by no means blind to humanity\u2019s ancient lusts, and the power to destroy \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\u201d when they led the 13 colonies to independence and then crafted a Constitution designed to check our worst impulses and harness our best ones.\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman once said: \u201cThree things ruin a man: power, money and women.\u201d If one recasts Truman\u2019s words to properly encompass all humanity, can anyone truly deny that virtually every conflict in politics and society involves power, money and/or sex?\n\nNonetheless, the founders and most of their successors refused to give in to unrelenting cynicism. That would be the ultimate breach of faith with all who have fought and died to preserve our land and its freedoms.\n\nWe may fail over and over to live up to our founding ideals. To surrender them, though, surely would doom us to despotism.\n\nRenewing our commitment is what Election Day is supposed to be all about.\n\nTruth and facts are always difficult to pin down and publicize when one or more humans perceive it\u2019s in their best interest to hide or twist them. That makes every election season a challenging exercise in seeking truth, the specific ideal of America\u2019s journalists \u2014 again, with regretfully varying fidelity \u2014 for at least the past hundred years.\n\nWe believe in that ideal, too. We\u2019ve presented the truth as best we know it in our news columns this election season, as we aim to do every issue. We\u2019ve abandoned individual candidate endorsements to reassure readers of our devotion to truth and facts. Even when we offer our own opinions, we seek to back them up with facts our readers can use as they will.\n\nThat includes our recent editorials on the three ballot questions, one statewide and two local, that Lincoln County voters will decide on Tuesday. To briefly recap them:\n\n\u201c We reluctantly recommend a vote \u201cFOR\u201d Initiative 427, the expansion of Medicaid coverage to more low-income Nebraskans. We don\u2019t believe it can be sustained, but approval would at least temporarily aid rural \u201ccritical access\u201d hospitals forced by the Affordable Care Act to swallow more federal Medicare reimbursement cuts.\n\n\u201c North Platte residents should vote \u201cYES\u201d for a half-cent city sales tax increase, which by state law must be dedicated to street, utility, parks and recreation projects. Approval would enlist visitors in sharing the cost for many long-delayed repairs and upgrades, which otherwise must be fully borne by property taxes.\n\n\u201c Finally, we find solid reasons to vote either way on a petition question asking whether Lincoln County should stick with three county commissioners or add two more.\n\nThese are just our opinions, though. The choices you face Tuesday are yours to make.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to you. We\u2019ll let you know how the votes add up. Thanks for reading, and for choosing us.\n\n______\n\nLincoln Journal Star.

The answer is no.\n\nThe desire to have a say in government is why this country exists in the first place. Our earliest patriots and founding fathers rebelled against a British crown that barred American colonists from participating in a government that unfairly taxed them. Men and women fought and died in the Revolutionary War - and others thereafter - to protect the right of their fellow Americans to vote.\n\nDespite this well-weathered history and argument, only once in the last four midterm elections have more than half of Nebraska\u2019s 1.2 million registered voters exercised their right to vote, according to data from Secretary of State John Gale\u2019s office. That number is a profound disappointment.\n\nThe local and statewide offices up for a vote this year have far more impact on Nebraskans\u2019 day-to-day lives than that of the White House. Yet, paradoxically, we show up in greater numbers when a presidential ticket is on the ballot.\n\nNobody but Nebraskans can weigh in on the races on this year\u2019s ballot, so make your opinions heard.\n\nAs a reminder, here are the candidates in contested races endorsed by the Journal Star editorial board as the best choice for the office:\n\n(asterisk) Governor: Pete Ricketts (R)\n\n(asterisk) U.S. Senate: Jane Raybould (D)\n\n(asterisk) U.S. House, 1st District: Jeff Fortenberry (R)\n\n(asterisk) Legislature, 24th District: Mark Kolterman\n\n(asterisk) Legislature, 26th District: Matt Hansen\n\n(asterisk) Legislature, 30th District: Myron Dorn\n\n(asterisk) Legislature, 32nd District: Laura Ebke\n\n(asterisk) Lancaster County treasurer: Rachel Garver (D)\n\n(asterisk) Lancaster County commissioner, District 1: Sean Flowerday (D)\n\n(asterisk) Lancaster County commissioner, District 5: Todd Wiltgen (R)\n\n(asterisk) Initiative 427 (Medicaid expansion): For\n\n(asterisk) Lincoln mayoral term limits (Prevents incumbent from seeking re-election and future mayors from serving more than three terms): Against\n\nWhether you agree with us is immaterial.

October 29, 2018.\n\nMost new homes are much more energy-efficient than those built decades ago, with thicker walls, more insulation and better windows, plus they contain appliances like furnaces, water heaters, refrigerators and even toilets that use less energy.\n\nNew zero-energy building standards have taken hold in Europe and spread to the United States, with the goal of creating as much energy \u2014 through passive and active solar, wind and other renewable energy sources \u2014 on-site as is used by the home.\n\nThe downside of the new standards is that construction is more expensive than conventional construction and not many contractors know how to build such homes as yet.\n\nStill, a few relatively minor changes to older, existing homes can make a big difference when it comes to energy consumption. Unfortunately, people who would benefit the most from lower energy bills often cannot afford the improvements to achieve them.\n\nThat\u2019s where the Nebraska Weatherization Assistance Program comes in.\n\nTuesday is Weatherization Day in Nebraska, spotlighting an effort that has been weatherizing homes for low-income and elderly citizens for more than 42 years.\n\nEight non-profit community service providers operate the program. Since the Weatherization Assistance Program began, over $204 million went to make energy efficiency improvements in more than 68,800 Nebraska homes affecting the lives of thousands of Nebraskans, many of who are elderly, disabled, and families with children. The program helps conserve energy and saves income for other basic needs. \u201cThe Weatherization Program is a powerful example of cooperation and coordination at local and state levels,\u201d said Jim Macy, Interim Director of the Nebraska Energy Office. \u201cRelying on local service providers enables us to address the needs of those needing help, and we get the added benefit of saving our energy resources.\u201d\n\nClients apply through their local community action agency or non-profit housing provider to determine eligibility. Weatherization improvements include weather-stripping, insulation, replacing broken glass and performing furnace and water heater inspections. Estimated energy savings for the last 40 years total $118.5 million\n\n\u201cOur community service providers pay close attention to detail in the weatherization work performed on homes,\u201d said Tom Tabor, Nebraska Energy Office Weatherization Program Manager. \u201cClients are identified by income and other factors, and then receive services as part of the program.\u201d\n\nLike many things, a little preparation pays off in the long run. Officials note that weatherization efforts contribute to the state\u2019s economic, social, and environmental progress by creating jobs; improving the housing stock; stabilizing neighborhoods; reducing homelessness; eliminating carbon emission; and reducing the risks of fire.\n\nThey say the program, in a typical year, saves more than $180,000 in electric and natural gas bills, with a future savings of over $1.1 million.\n\nSouthwest Nebraska is served by Mid-Nebraska Community Action Partnership and can be contacted at the McCook office, 108 West C, (308) 345-1187.

Poles are voting in local runoff elections to choose the mayors of several key cities, including Krakow and Gdansk, and more than 640 other towns and smaller localities. (AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski)\n\nWARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 Poland\u2019s populist ruling party suffered a major setback in the country\u2019s mayoral races, losing not only in all large cities but also in most mid-size and smaller cities. The results Monday dashed the ruling party\u2019s ambitions for greater power nationally and showed the flaws of the party\u2019s courtship of the far right.\n\nIn mayoral races in 649 cities, towns and smaller municipalities, official results released Monday showed that Poland\u2019s ruling right-wing Law and Justice party, in power since 2015, won no big city and only a handful of the smaller cities. The largest city captured by the conservatives was Zamosc, population 65,000.\n\nMichal Szuldrzynski, a leading editor with the Rzeczpospolita daily, said Law and Justice\u2019s results in the mid-size cities \u2014 normally bastions of the political right \u2014 were \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the governing party. He argued in an opinion piece the results indicated that Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and the ruling party have \u201cfailed to regain a moderate center and build up support among the middle class.\u201d\n\nAmong the factors that have alienated many voters are Morawiecki\u2019s \u201cflirting with the most radical part of the electorate,\u201d with gestures and words meant to appeal to far-right nationalists, Szuldrzynski argued.\n\nHe also listed disputes with the European Union over rule of law issues and a controversial Holocaust speech law early this year that sparked a clash with Israel, which in his view was Poland\u2019s most serious diplomatic crisis since communism fell in 1989.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Donald Tusk, now head of the European Council, said in Warsaw that he was \u201cvery surprised\u201d by the scale of Law and Justice\u2019s defeat in smaller cities. He said the result was a warning to the ruling party and a boost to the opposition Civic Platform party, which he used to lead.\n\nIn the first round of local voting on Oct. 21, an opposition coalition led by the centrist Civic Platform won outright in the capital, Warsaw, and in other key cities, including Wroclaw, Poznan and Lodz.\n\nIn runoff races Sunday, voters handed landslide victories to opposition politicians in other prestigious cities, including Krakow, Gdansk and Kielce.\n\nWhile the opposition celebrated Monday, ruling party leaders sought to keep the focus on the party\u2019s strong showing in Poland\u2019s regional assemblies two weeks ago.\n\nLaw and Justice \u201cwon the local elections of 2018,\u201d the deputy culture minister, Jaroslaw Sellin, told TVN24. \u201cIt won them like nobody has managed to do yet.\u201d\n\nThe mayoral results, however, clearly reflected the strong opposition of urban Poles to Law and Justice, which has been accused of violating democratic standards with attempts to take control of the courts and turn public media into a party propaganda tool. The Law and Justice government has also been in frequent conflict with the EU over democratic standards.\n\nThe results in Poland\u2019s mayoral races have proven a boost to Civic Platform and other opposition parties. However, many analysts warned that their relatively decent showing resulted largely from votes against the ruling party, and said that if the opposition wants a chance of governing the country it will need to increase its appeal. The opposition\u2019s defeat in some places to independent candidates seemed to reflect their vulnerability.\n\nOverall, the local election highlighted the deep political divisions in Poland.\n\nOn one side are urban, liberal Poles who feel that the ruling populists are destroying their country\u2019s hard-won democracy.\n\nOn the other are conservatives \u2014 often older, rural and less educated voters \u2014 who appreciate the ruling party\u2019s attempts to preserve traditional Catholic values and resist what they feel are corrupting influences from Western Europe.\n\n___\n\nMonika Scislowska in Warsaw contributed.", "Judge: Teenager accused of killing mom will remain in jail\n\nDAYTONA BEACH, Fla.

Deben Tchoffo said the students abducted Sunday night were ages 11-17, and they were taken from Nkwen, a village near the regional capital, Bamenda, along with school staff that included the principal.\n\n\u201cIt is rather unfortunate that this is happening, that 79 of our children and three of their staff can be picked up by terrorists,\u201d Tchoffo said. \u201cWe have asked our military to do everything and bring back the kids alive.\u201d\n\nA video purporting to show the kidnapped students was posted on social media from a group of men who call themselves \u201cAmba boys,\u201d a reference to the state of Ambazonia that armed separatists want to establish in Cameroon\u2019s Anglophone North West and South West regions.\n\nIn the video, men who identified themselves as the kidnappers forced several boys to give their names and those of their parents. The boys also said they were taken by the armed men late Sunday and didn\u2019t know where they were being held.\n\nThe men in the video said they would only release the students once the goal of creating a new state is achieved.\n\n\u201cWe shall only release you after the struggle. You will be going to school now here,\u201d the men said. The video could not be independently verified, but parents said on social media they recognized their children in the recording.\n\nFighting between the military and separatists increased after the government clamped down on peaceful demonstrations by English-speaking teachers and lawyers protesting what they said were their marginalization by Cameroon\u2019s French-speaking majority.\n\nHundreds have been killed in the past year.\n\nThe separatists have vowed to destabilize the regions as part of the strategy for creating a breakaway state. They have attacked civilians who do not support their cause, including teachers who were killed for disobeying orders to keep schools closed.\n\nThere have been kidnappings at other schools, but the group taken Sunday was the largest number abducted at one time in Cameroon\u2019s Anglophone regions. The separatists also have set fire to at least 100 schools and driven out students and teachers from buildings taken over as training grounds.\n\n\u201cThese appalling abductions show just how the general population is paying the highest price as violence escalates in the Anglophone region,\u201d said Samira Daoud, Amnesty International deputy regional director for West and Central Africa. \u201cThe abduction of schoolchildren and teachers can never be justified.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International expressed solidarity with the students\u2019 families and demanded \u201cthat the Cameroon authorities do everything in their power to ensure all the pupils and school staff are freed unharmed.\u201d\n\nLast week, separatist militants attacked workers on a state-run rubber plantation in southwestern Cameroon, allegedly chopping off their fingers because the men defied an order to stay away from the farms.\n\nAn American missionary also died in the North West region near its capital, Bamenda, when he was shot in the head amid fighting between separatists and soldiers.\n\nThe turmoil in Cameroon comes after President Paul Biya won a seventh term last month in an election the U.S. said was marked by irregularities.

He faces a maximum eight-year prison sentence in the May 2017 disappearance of Isabella Hellmann, his wife of just three months. U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno set sentencing for Jan. 10.\n\n\u201cAlthough nothing can ever erase the pain and suffering caused by Lewis Bennett\u2019s criminal acts, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and our law enforcement partners hope that the defendant\u2019s admission of guilt is a step toward justice for the victim,\u201d U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan said in a statement.\n\nBennett, a mining engineer, had told the FBI and British journalists that he and Hellmann, a South Florida real estate agent, took their 37-foot (11-meter) catamaran, Surf Into Summer, for a Caribbean cruise. They left their infant daughter, Emelia, with her family in Florida.\n\nAs the catamaran passed the Bahamas on the return to Florida, Bennett sent out an emergency radio signal. When the Coast Guard found him on a life raft three hours later, he told rescuers he left Hellmann on deck as he retired for the night to their cabin. He said he was jolted awake when their craft hit something and that Hellmann was gone when he went outside. He said he abandoned the catamaran in a life raft because it was sinking.\n\nA sworn document signed by Bennett and filed in court says that he could not recall whether he called out for his wife. He did not deploy any flares and did not search for Hellmann in the water with either the catamaran or an attached dinghy. Nor did Bennet immediately activate any emergency equipment or call for help using his satellite phone.\n\nIt was not until Bennett boarded the life raft that he called for help and reported his wife missing, about 45 minutes after he was awakened.\n\nProsecutors said Bennett is an experienced sailor who received a certification from the Royal Yachting Association in the United Kingdom as a \u201cCoastal Skipper.\u201d The training included instruction on emergency procedures such as man-overboard protocols and night-sailing safety. His wife was not nearly as experienced.\n\nThe Coast Guard eventually located the boat. The FBI says an inspection of the catamaran before it sank showed portholes below the waterline had been opened and damage to the twin hulls appeared to have been caused from the inside, meaning the boat may have been intentionally scuttled.\n\nAlso investigators found Bennett on the life raft with $100,000 worth of coins stolen from a yacht he had worked aboard in 2016.\n\nBennett pleaded guilty to the coin theft charge and received a seven-month prison sentence. While serving that sentence, he was charged in February with Hellmann\u2019s death and has remained jailed.\n\n___\n\nFollow Curt Anderson on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Miamicurt", "RENNER, S.D.

It has therefore at no time been used in the context of Financial Fair Play.\u201d\n\nMediapart reported that Rybolovlev planned to inject millions of dollars of his own money into the club\u2019s accounts \u2014 in violation with UEFA rules \u2014 through the marketing deal signed in June 2014.\n\n\u201cAIM was to ensure the club received annual revenues of 140 million euros for a period of 10 years,\u201d Mediapart said. \u201cIt represented an extraordinary sum - higher than the club\u2019s then-annual spending of 125 million euros, but also five times more than the value of the largest sponsorship deals secured by Real Madrid or FC Barcelona.\u201d\n\nThe online newspaper said that Monaco had registered losses up to 170 million euros over the three previous seasons and was at risk of being excluded from the Champions League.\n\n\u201cThe plan was for the sum to be secretly provided by Rybolovlev, using an offshore arrangement that funneled the funds via the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong,\u201d Mediapart wrote. \u201cThus Rybolovlev\u2019s funds would appear to come from a sponsorship deal, which would meet the requirements of UEFA\u2019s financial fair play rules.\u201d\n\nIn its response, Monaco denied any wrongdoing and said it wanted to increase its commercial resources and sponsorship through the deal. Monaco insisted the contract was real and included \u201cmarketing resources, sponsoring but also all revenue related to the Champions League. The agency had to find 30 million euros in additional resources.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mediapart, the deal ultimately collapsed because of a dispute between Rybolovlev and the head of AIM, Bernard de Roos, who reportedly threatened to reveal the scam to UEFA. Monaco said it never went through because it proved to be \u201ctoo ambitious and unachievable.\u201d\n\nPlaced under investigation by UEFA\u2019s Club Financial Control Body for its overspending, Monaco reached a settlement in 2015 to pay a fine of 3 million euros, plus 10 suspended. Mediapart claimed that UEFA\u2019s investigatory chamber had opened an investigation into the AIM contract but that Monaco escaped heavy sanctions through a campaign of lobbying of Andrea Traverso, the head of UEFA\u2019s financial fair play program.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "FILE- In this Sept. 21, 2018, file photo Ludacris performs at the 2018 iHeartRadio Music Festival Day 1 held at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

We endorse each of them.\n\nSchoolcraft College in Livonia is asking for a Headlee override to restore it\u2019s full tax levy of 2.27 mills. That would be about a half mill increase, or about $50 a year on a home valued at $200,000.\n\nIt\u2019s a good investment. Schoolcraft has been innovative in serving its community, adding numerous certificates and two-year degrees to train those who aren\u2019t going on for a bachelor\u2019s degree for meaningful careers.\n\nIt has also been creative in its funding, leasing out it\u2019s unused property to produce income.\n\nBut still it is operating at a deficit despite considerable cost-cutting. Approving the proposal would simply return Schoolcraft to the millage rate voters agreed to pay when the college was formed more than three decades ago.\n\nThe college\u2019s tax district includes the Livonia, Garden City, Clarenceville, Plymouth-Canton and Northville school districts.\n\nWayne County Community College District is asking for an early renewal and consolidation of two existing millages.\n\nPassage would not increase taxes.\n\nThe measure would give WCCCD certainty as it plans for future growth. Like Schoolcraft, it plays a critical role in training Detroit and Wayne County students for the jobs that are in demand today.\n\nVoters in Dearborn are asked to renew a one-mill levy for Henry Ford Community College.

November 2, 2018\n\nDon\u2019t be left out of Tuesday vote\n\nTo hear the political pundits and editorial writers tell it, this is the most important mid-term election in the history of American democracy. They\u2019ve never said one wasn\u2019t important, so maybe there is something to it.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just them. Early voting is setting records in states across the country. In Michigan, voters have been requesting absentee ballots in numbers normally seen only during presidential election years.\n\nWhatever the self-appointed experts are saying, voters are excited about Election Day this year, too. Pollsters and analysts all have their theories to explain why.\n\nFeel free to ignore them. Find your own motives to vote on Tuesday. There are plenty to choose from, ranging from street repairs and reproductive rights to tax policies and Asian carp in the Great Lakes. Find the candidates whose motives match yours and vote for them on Election Day. Or find the candidate whose motives you most oppose and vote against him or her; that\u2019s good, too, in our system of politics and government.\n\nSome of our recommendations as you consider your choices:\n\nGretchen Whitmer is Michigan\u2019s best choice for its next governor. She is serious about changing the way we educate our children, protect natural resources and maintain streets. She has credible plans to lower auto insurance premiums, improve schools and keep Nestle\u2019s hands off our water.\n\nFor the 10th Congressional District, the race is full of qualified candidates. Based on his experience and record, we believe freshman Rep. Paul Mitchell should be re-elected. Despite being in his first term, he has been one of the grown-ups in Congress, working to get things done without partisan bluster.\n\nDemocrat Kimberly Bizon would not be a bad choice. She has a solid record of environmental and political activism and well-considered plans for what she would do in Congress to best represent the Blue Water Area and to improve America.\n\nMayor Pauline Repp should be re-elected to lead the city of Port Huron. She best recognizes what the city must do to maintain its upward trajectory. She understands city government and her role in it, collaborates well with other local and state officials and works for all city residents.\n\nVote no on Proposal 1, the ballot issue that would legalize the recreational use of marijuana. Approval would unleash a costly menace that Michigan cannot afford.\n\nVote yes on Proposal 2 to end gerrymandering. Allowing politicians to draw legislative districts disenfranchises too many Michigan voters, including voters here.\n\nVote yes on Proposal 3 to protect the voting process. We wish it weren\u2019t needed, but state lawmakers have disregarded voters too often.\n\n___\n\nThe Mining Journal (Marquette).

November 4, 2018\n\n1. Politicians don\u2019t have better information than you do.\n\nPoliticians don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about? Shock, gasp, right? It\u2019s the oldest saying in Washington, D.C. but it\u2019s also true \u2014 potentially more true today than it ever was.\n\nThe Guardian published a great editorial on the science behind misinformation last week. While much hullabaloo is made of social media\u2019s role, misinforming politicians is not a new phenomenon \u2014 and Big Tobacco wrote its most effective playbook.\n\nWhat works isn\u2019t blatant fabrication, rather stoking confusion and playing up irrelevant truths. The Guardian\u2019s example was the Big Tobacco push for asbestos-caused cancer research \u2014 hint: it wasn\u2019t for our health, but rather to provide a distraction that proved healthier for their bottom line.\n\nOver time, confusion and strategically-placed irrelevant information can sway even the smartest politician. A recent study modeled how decision-makers become swayed into believing things that all relevant experts know to be untrue. To repeat: They believe things all relevant experts know to be untrue \u2014 that should give us all pause when we consider the power of lobbyists at all political levels.\n\n2. Fake news works on voters.\n\nTake Brazil, for example.\n\nIn June, the country\u2019s electoral court made each political party promise to refrain from fake news during the presidential campaign. By the October runoff election between Jair Bolsonaro, the head of the Social Liberal Party, and Workers\u2019 Party candidate Fernando Haddad, a Bloomberg report called the Brazil\u2019s main social media \u2014 WhatsApp \u2014 an \u201cimpenetrable candyland of misinformation\u201d complete with a partisan assassination video actually lifted from a robbery.\n\nA Brazilian newspaper investigation revealed that a group of entrepreneurs had paid influencers to spread anti-Haddad content from their private WhatsApp groups, but no determination has been made to see if that constitutes an illegal campaign contribution.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s victory gave rise to the dispute that fake news was a factor in the campaign.\n\nThink of the many dollars spent in this election cycle, pressing influence into your physical and digital inboxes, eyeballs and ears. Are the charges simplistic, targeting an emotional reaction?\n\nYou can bet on it, but you don\u2019t have to vote it in.\n\n3. Having to wade through the muck of false information gives rise to the two-headed dragon of polarization and apathy \u2014 that also, ironically, allows it to exist.\n\nFake news at its core is fueled by our mistrust \u2014 mistrust of traditional news, mistrust of science and scientists, mistrust of knowledge and the systems behind knowledge.\n\nWhen you start believing that you can\u2019t believe anything, fake news expert University of Connecticut professor Michael Patrick Lynch told Bloomberg that we double down on preexisting beliefs or opt out of the system entirely.\n\nSays Bloomberg, \u201cThe electorate is then divided between those who dominate the discourse with information that supports only their personal views and those who tune out politics entirely.\u201d\n\nSound familiar?\n\nThe good news is that knowing what\u2019s out there and being aware of the forces at play make us all smarter voters. We know \u201calternative facts\u201d are more rampant than, you know, facts. But that doesn\u2019t stop us from searching past the easy answer. That\u2019s our job as a newspaper. But it\u2019s also our responsibility as voters to make an informed choice, and to demand that those who represent us are informed as well.\n\n___", "The Latest: Abrams says Kemp blames others for security flaw\n\nIn this Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018, photo, Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp speaks during a rally at the Columbia County Exhibition Center in Grovetown, Ga.

The commission is investigating a pyramid scheme that cheated thousands of Poles out of their savings during Tusk's time as Poland's prime minister. (AP Photo/Alik Keplicz)\n\nWARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 Donald Tusk, the head of the European Council, strongly defended his actions as Poland\u2019s former prime minister during questioning Monday into a pyramid scheme that cheated thousands of Poles out of their savings.\n\nIn an emotional moment during the seven-hour hearing, which was televised live across Poland, Tusk told the ruling conservative party that it was using his questioning by a parliamentary committee for political purposes.\n\n\u201cYou need this commission, you need this spectacle, to keep repeating ... your insinuations, also on the subject of my family,\u201d Tusk said.\n\nStill, Tusk said during the questioning that he did not feel particularly threatened or the object of a witch hunt. He said he was confident in his actions as prime minister from 2007 to 2014.\n\nTusk said the hearing showed the weakness of the commission, which he said was trying to put blame on him.\n\nBefore the hearing, Tusk told reporters he rearranged his EU calendar and showed up because he treats the commission\u2019s work \u201cseriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was my obligation as a citizen,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, there was no escaping the political overtones of Monday\u2019s interrogation, for there have been years of enmity between Tusk and Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski. Commentators on private TVN24 described the event as a public \u201cgrilling,\u201d and it was widely seen as part of the conservative party\u2019s efforts to discredit Tusk, a political foe who is still popular in Poland.\n\nTusk was sworn in by the special multi-party commission that has already questioned dozens of state officials in its efforts to pinpoint responsibility for the scam. Addressing him as \u201cprime minister\u201d the commission sought to determine the scope of Tusk\u2019s authority over state security and other offices and when he was made aware of the pyramid scheme by the Amber Gold financial institution.\n\nProsecutors say some 19,000 investors lost over 850 million zlotys ($225 million) in what turned out to be one of the biggest financial scandals in Poland. Amber Gold\u2019s two founders are both under arrest in prison and are on trial facing up to 15-year sentences. One of them is also serving a prison term for another bank scam.\n\nThe scam, which was revealed in 2012, has raised questions about the effectiveness of Poland\u2019s government during Tusk\u2019s term in office. Critics say Polish authorities failed to react in time to warning signals about Amber Gold.\n\nRejecting these allegations, Tusk said a warning against Amber Gold was issued by the Polish Financial Supervision Commission, or KNF, and it was not the prime minister\u2019s job to issue such a warning.\n\n\u201cWhile I have sympathy for those who invested in Amber Gold, because they are the victims of these dealings, I want to say that a warning by the KNF that it was linked to very high risk was publicly available,\u201d Tusk said.\n\nHe suggested that some anti-crime procedures had failed in the Amber Gold case, as well as fiscal controls and the office for protecting consumers.\n\n\u201cIn the Amber Gold case, had all the links described in the procedure worked as they should have, we would have probably managed to avoid the lion\u2019s share of the losses that people sustained,\u201d Tusk said.\n\nOne of the themes of the investigation and of Monday\u2019s questioning was the fact that Tusk\u2019s son Michal was employed by an airline owned by Amber Gold. Tusk denied allegations that his son\u2019s job could have served as a protective umbrella for the pyramid scheme.\n\nThe televised questioning came a day after Poland\u2019s populist ruling party suffered a blow in the country\u2019s mayoral races by failing to win control of any of the nation\u2019s largest cities. The pyramid probe commission\u2019s own chief, Malgorzata Wassermann of Law and Justice, lost her bid to become mayor of the city of Krakow.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s runoff races, Poles chose the mayors of 649 cities, towns and local municipalities across the central European nation of 37 million, handing landslide victories to opposition politicians in top cities. Polish media described the results as a clear defeat for Law and Justice.\n\nTusk said he was \u201cvery surprised by the scale of Law and Justice\u2019s defeat\u201d and said the opposition got a boost from the local elections.\n\nThe vote highlighted the deep political divisions in Poland between the country\u2019s urban liberals and its staunchly conservative, often older, rural residents.\n\nFor his part, Kaczynski claims that negligence under Tusk was the reason for the 2010 plane crash in which his twin brother, President Lech Kaczynski, was killed. Tusk and the president had a rocky relationship.\n\nHowever, the investigation into the plane crash in Smolensk, Russia \u2014 which killed 96 state, military and other officials \u2014 said it was due to human error amid poor visibility at a rudimentary airport.\n\n___\n\nThis story has corrected the reasons why Amber Gold\u2019s two founders are in prison.

The purple and blue colors are where there is the least ozone, and the yellows and reds are where there is more ozone. A United Nations report released on Monday, Nov. 5, 2018 says Earth\u2019s protective ozone layer is finally healing after aerosol sprays and coolants ate away at it. (NASA via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Earth\u2019s protective ozone layer is finally healing from damage caused by aerosol sprays and coolants, a new United Nations report said.\n\nThe ozone layer had been thinning since the late 1970s. Scientists raised the alarm and ozone-depleting chemicals were phased out worldwide.\n\nAs a result, the upper ozone layer above the Northern Hemisphere should be completely repaired in the 2030s and the gaping Antarctic ozone hole should disappear in the 2060s, according to a scientific assessment released Monday at a conference in Quito, Ecuador. The Southern Hemisphere lags a bit and its ozone layer should be healed by mid-century.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really good news,\u201d said report co-chairman Paul Newman, chief Earth scientist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center. \u201cIf ozone-depleting substances had continued to increase, we would have seen huge effects. We stopped that.\u201d\n\nHigh in the atmosphere, ozone shields Earth from ultraviolet rays that cause skin cancer, crop damage and other problems. Use of man-made chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which release chlorine and bromine, began eating away at the ozone. In 1987, countries around the world agreed in the Montreal Protocol to phase out CFCs and businesses came up with replacements for spray cans and other uses.\n\nAt its worst in the late 1990s, about 10 percent of the upper ozone layer was depleted, said Newman. Since 2000, it has increased by about 1 to 3 percent per decade, the report said.\n\nThis year, the ozone hole over the South Pole peaked at nearly 9.6 million square miles (24.8 million square kilometers). That\u2019s about 16 percent smaller than the biggest hole recorded \u2014 11.4 million square miles (29.6 million square kilometers) in 2006.\n\nThe hole reaches its peak in September and October and disappears by late December until the next Southern Hemisphere spring, Newman said.\n\nThe ozone layer starts at about 6 miles (10 kilometers) above Earth and stretches for nearly 25 miles (40 kilometers); ozone is a colorless combination of three oxygen atoms.\n\nIf nothing had been done to stop the thinning, the world would have destroyed two-thirds of its ozone layer by 2065, Newman said.\n\nBut it\u2019s not a complete success yet, said University of Colorado\u2019s Brian Toon, who wasn\u2019t part of the report.\n\n\u201cWe are only at a point where recovery may have started,\u201d Toon said, pointing to some ozone measurements that haven\u2019t increased yet.\n\nAnother problem is that new technology has found an increase in emissions of a banned CFC out of East Asia, the report noted.\n\nOn its own, the ozone hole has slightly shielded Antarctica from the much larger effects of global warming \u2014 it has heated up but not as much as it likely would without ozone depletion, said Ross Salawitch, a University of Maryland atmospheric scientist who co-authored the report.\n\nSo a healed ozone layer will worsen man-made climate change there a bit, Newman said.\n\nScientists don\u2019t know how much a healed ozone hole will further warm Antarctica, but they do know the immediate effects of ozone depletion on the world and human health, so \u201cit would be incredibly irresponsible not to do this,\u201d Salawitch said.\n\nAnd the replacements now being used to cool cars and refrigerators need to be replaced themselves with chemicals that don\u2019t worsen global warming, Newman said. An amendment to the Montreal Protocol that goes into effect next year would cut use of some of those gases.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can do a victory lap until 2060,\u201d Newman said. \u201cThat will be for our grandchildren to do.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

(AP Photo/Michel Euler, File)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Bono has a message for the U.S. Congress: Thanks for ignoring President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump has sought to slash hundreds of millions of dollars from U.S. funding for AIDS programs at home and abroad, but the U2 frontman says members of Congress \u201chave so far turned down this president\u2019s request to cut AIDS funding \u2014 right and left in lockstep together on this.\u201d\n\nHis message to them? \u201cThank you for your leadership.\u201d\n\nBono is caught between hope and frustration as \u2014 for the third time in a decade \u2014 he organizes an auction to raise money for the fight against HIV/AIDS. Sotheby\u2019s announced details Monday of the Dec. 5 sale in Miami to benefit (RED), the charity founded by Bono in 2006.\n\nTwo previous sales, in 2008 and 2013, raised $68 million. Five years on from the last, Bono says big strides in prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS are threatened by a slackening of global resolve.\n\n\u201cWe could be at the dumbest moment ever, which is we\u2019re almost at the moon and we turn back,\u201d Bono told The Associated Press by phone from Dublin.\n\nAlmost 37 million people worldwide have HIV, with nearly 22 million of them receiving antiretroviral therapy, the most effective form of treatment, according to UNAIDS. The number of annual infections has fallen by almost half since 1996, to 1.8 million, and the number of deaths has halved since 2004.\n\nBono says the results are the product of \u201cincredible leadership from around the world\u201d that has made the elimination of the disease a realistic prospect.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this gathering consensus and momentum \u2014 and now people are looking the other way, and it\u2019s just the wrong moment,\u201d he said.\n\nTo help draw attention back to the cause, Bono turned to two influential artists whose work, he says, \u201chas a social-justice core.\u201d The auction is curated by British architect David Adjaye, who designed the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., and U.S. artist Theaster Gates, who runs artistic and social projects from his base on Chicago\u2019s south side.\n\nAdopting the theme \u201clight,\u201d the pair has assembled more than 50 lots from artists, architects and designers, including Ai Weiwei, Jeff Koons, Yinka Shonibare and Sean Scully. Design pieces include sneakers by Christian Louboutin; a curvy coffee table by the late Zaha Hadid; and a ring carved from a whole diamond, created by Apple Inc. design chief Jony Ive and industrial designer Mark Newson.\n\nAdjaye is offering items he\u2019s designed including a concrete speaker \u2014 in red, naturally \u2014 and Gates has contributed one of a series of tapestries made from strips of used fire hose.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to re-shed light on this subject matter, metaphorically,\u201d said Adjaye, who also worries that the world\u2019s attention has strayed from AIDS, and other crises.\n\n\u201cI think our collective sense of civil society is very much under siege,\u201d he said. \u201cThat creates a kind of \u2018not my problem\u2019 attitude, and I think we have to counter that.\u201d\n\nMoney raised by the auction will go to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and to Gates\u2019 Rebuild Foundation, which works with deprived communities in Chicago.\n\nOne criticism sometimes made of charities like (RED), which has persuaded big companies including Bank of America, Starbucks and Apple to promote AIDS awareness, is that its work lets politicians and governments off the hook.\n\nBono argues that \u201cthe point is to put them back on the hook.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaking something popular makes the politicians have to pay attention,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to need that more than ever\u201d in an era of growing nationalism.\n\n\u201cWomen are the rising category (of infections) at the moment, and whilst the world is looking the other way in this rather childish fight among strongmen across the world, these budgets are being cut and women are paying the highest price.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really deeply upsetting for us all,\u201d he added. \u201cBecause we were really getting excited. We thought, we\u2019re at the point of inflection. And now we hear, \u2018No, no. We\u2019re going to cut these budgets.\u2019 It\u2019s not just America. A lot of countries are putting themselves first. At least they think it\u2019s first \u2014 but as you know global health crises don\u2019t respect borders.\u201d\n\nArtworks in the auction will be exhibited by Gagosian at the Moore Building in Miami from Dec. 1 to Dec. 7. They will be sold in a live auction Dec. 5 and an online sale that is open for bidding Nov. 12-Dec. 7.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jill Lawless on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless"]
