["DURANGO, Colo. (AP) \u2014 About 500 residents in eastern La Plata County have made a commitment to ensure 10 percent of their food comes from local sources.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a challenge, but it\u2019s not intimidating,\u201d said Kami Larson, a Bayfield resident.\n\nResidents from Vallecito to Sambrito, New Mexico, have pledged to raise, buy or trade for 10 percent of their food, including meat, dairy, fruits and vegetables, said Pam Willhoite, coordinator of Pine River Shares, a nonprofit.\n\nResidents signed the pledges as part of a larger effort called Field to Fork organized by Pine River Shares. The goal of Field to Fork is to encourage more local food production, bolster the agricultural economy and encourage neighbors to share food.\n\nPine River Shares is focused on improving the health of residents. It identified lack of access to affordable, healthy food as a primary barrier to good health about five years ago. Field to Fork is an effort to build food systems that are largely independent in eastern La Plata County that expand access to fresh healthy produce, protein and dairy.\n\nMany residents are open to the 10 percent goal, and some gardeners and livestock producers are already meeting the goal, said Larson, a Pine River Shares volunteer.\n\nThe goal also started a conversation among residents about how they measure 10 percent of their food consumption, whether it is through dollars, calories or how often residents purchase local food. The group accepts that different people will achieve the goal in different ways.\n\n\u201cTen percent can be interpreted very loosely. ... The main thing is it got people thinking about food,\u201d said Jim Fitzgerald, a volunteer with Pine River Shares.\n\nIn Larson\u2019s case, it helped her think about how she could go above and beyond the 10 percent.\n\nLarson was already an avid gardener and purchased her eggs and milk locally. But through Field to Fork, she found local bread, chicken, salad greens, apples and pears.\n\nPine River Shares aims to sign up 10 percent of the population of the Pine River Valley, or 1,400 residents, to hit the goal in the next three years, she said.\n\nIt is possible 1,400 residents are already hitting the goal, and the nonprofit just needs to identify them, she said.\n\nOnce those residents are identified, the group can connect producers with their neighbors who are interested in buying or bartering with them to help foster the consumption of local food, she said.\n\nAs more residents consume local food, Larson expects to see economic benefits for families and producers. Families could spend less on groceries by reducing the amount they spend on gas to drive into Durango to go shopping and increase the amount of money farmers can make.\n\nTo help develop plans for a food system this year, Pine River Shares held 11 meetings in Bayfield, Arboles, Vallecito, Allison, Forest Lakes and Ignacio, said Tiana Lemley, the 10 percent campaign coordinator.\n\nThe plan outlines a vision for food production, processing, distribution, marketing, composting, cooking education, gleaning teams and new outlets for sales, according to vision boards developed by the nonprofit.\n\nThe plan also named concrete steps the group will take, such as establishing commercial kitchens, founding an Ignacio farmers market and setting up food-gleaning teams.\n\nThe meetings helped bring together residents and helped foster food sharing, Lemley said.\n\n\u201cPeople are trading carrots for eggs or compost tea for acorn squash or garlic for strawberry jam. It\u2019s been heartwarming to see the \u2018wealth\u2019 in those personal connections,\u201d she said.\n\nSome of the groups that came together to develop the food system continue to meet on their own, she said.\n\nFor example, one of the largest and most active groups meets at the Mt. Allison Grange and draws residents from Arboles and Sambrito, a small New Mexico community.\n\nVivian Hansen, a Mt. Allison Grange member, started a garden with about nine kids from her neighborhood who were already coming to her house for snacks.\n\nHer policy with the children who visit her home is, \u201cI don\u2019t have any money, but I\u2019ll always feed you,\u201d she said.\n\nShe hopes it will keep them out of trouble in the small subdivision that doesn\u2019t offer much entertainment for children.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing like working in the dirt,\u201d she said.\n\nThe group raised tomatoes, broccoli, corn, kale, zucchini and beans, said Connor Seagrave, 10. His favorite crops were purple beans and tomatoes.\n\nThe Sambrito garden is a classic example of what Field to Fork is trying to nurture, because residents of the neighborhood founded a garden that made sense for their community, Willhoite said.\n\nIn the short term, Pine River Shares volunteers plan to compile a directory of producers and consumers across the valley to encourage commerce.", "GREELEY, Colo. (AP) \u2014 In her later years in Greeley, Edna Middlemas downplayed the fact she had been awarded the meritorious service version of the Bronze Star for her work as Edna Heinecke in the Women\u2019s Army Corps during World War II.\n\n\u201cShe used to say, \u2018You know, I just got the Bronze Star for keeping my mouth shut,\u2019\u201d her daughter, Diana Reese of Salida, said.\n\nThere was a lot to keep her mouth shut about.\n\nYet as the letter of recommendation and the Bronze Star citation her children discovered in a file after her death at age 102 this past July in Greeley made clear, there was more to it than that.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t even shown her children the medal itself until the week after their father, Burt Middlemas, died in late 2004 and they talked Edna into opening up her trunk of military effects.\n\nAt the pivotal Yalta Conference in February 1945, the forces of Germany were on the verge of defeat and the Allies began to plot post-war European strategies.\n\nEdna, a WAC stenographer who had graduated from what now are known as Greeley Central High and the University of Northern Colorado, transcribed and took notes about the communication among those present.\n\nThose present included President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet Union Premier Josef Stalin.\n\nAmong other things, and this is presumption because Edna took seriously the order to remain discreet until the day she died, she documented that the leaders agreed that only unconditional surrender from Germany would be acceptable.\n\nThe recommending letter and citation praised her for not just taking notes and contributing to the official report, but also for her accuracy and portrayal of the words, tones and messages exchanged by the leaders. As the documents also noted, she helped coordinate communications for the conference.\n\nBut would she ever tell her kids about it? Even when they asked? Even many years later after many World War II documents had been declassified? Not even something innocuous about, say, Churchill\u2019s cigar?\n\n\u201cOh no, oh no, oh no,\u201d her son, Harry Middlemas, said emphatically from Grand Junction. \u201cOh no, that would be way beyond anything she would do. First of all, it would be bragging or showing off. And, second, I\u2019m sure she was told that was top secret and that stayed top secret with her. We joked with her some about it. We\u2019d say, \u2018Mom, that was 40 years ago .\u2019 Or whatever. We\u2019d say, \u2018Surely you can talk about it now.\u2019\u201d\n\nNope. She wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cShe was very tight-mouthed for years and years,\u201d her daughter, Mary Christiansen, said. \u201cWe said to her for years, \u2018Mom, the war is over. You can talk now.\u2019 But she took it seriously that she had a high security clearance and wasn\u2019t supposed to talk. She didn\u2019t talk even long after it was over.\u201d\n\nAlso during the war, Edna served as a WAC in North Africa, Iran, Italy, France and Germany. As the war raged around her, she worked with Gen. Carter Magruder, one of the U.S. forces\u2019 most influential war planners and logisticians.\n\nTo those three children \u2014 Diana Reese, Harry Middlemas and Mary Christiansen \u2014 Edna Middlemas was \u201cMom.\u201d\n\nJust \u201cMom.\u201d\n\nShe would have been 103 on Friday.\n\nThis will be the first time her three children - a blended family, yet one in which all three kids wholeheartedly consider Edna their mother \u2014 won\u2019t be able to celebrate her birthday with her, and it will be wrenching.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to celebrate that day, celebrate having such a fantastic mom who was such a great role model,\u201d Reese said. \u201cI know she\u2019s in a better place. I miss her terribly. I\u2019m going to be celebrating a life well lived. She was so humble. Talking about herself wasn\u2019t something that she did.\u201d\n\nSaid Harry Middlemas: \u201cIf anything, it will be a day of celebration. She was not one to brag on herself. Every once in a while, you could get her to talk, but it wasn\u2019t anything you could get her to carry on about.\u201d\n\nThis remarkable woman spent much of her life in Greeley, moving to the area with her previously nomadic family in 1930, at the start of the Great Depression. Edna Heinecke was 14. Her father, Rev. Harry Heinecke, was a minister, preaching at First Presbyterian Church (now Cornerstone Community Church) and other churches in Northern Colorado region.\n\nAfter her UNC graduation, Edna went to work in a Greeley real-estate office. Soon, she took a Civil Service exam and virtually immediately was summoned to Washington D.C. to work in the War Department. Although Edna didn\u2019t talk about it, Mary Christiansen theorized that her score was off the charts. \u201cShe really wasn\u2019t looking to go to Washington, but they called her,\u201d Christiansen said.\n\nIn 1943 \u2014 with the U.S. fully involved in the European and Pacific theaters \u2014 she joined the Women\u2019s Army Corps, becoming a \u201cWAC.\u201d\n\nSoon, she was working with Magruder and significantly contributing to the American war effort on the planning and communications front, including at Yalta.\n\nShe did share a few stories \u2014 ones she didn\u2019t consider violations of her secrecy mandate \u2014 about her service with her children and others, but not many. One was about mischievously going Absent Without Leave, journeying to Rome and joining in the celebration of its liberation, accepting two weeks\u2019 confinement to barracks as her \u201cpunishment.\u201d\n\nAfter three years of post-war work in Washington, Edna in 1948 resumed working for Magruder, who became chief of staff of the Army, including at the Pentagon.\n\nShe married Burt Middlemas, a World War II Navy veteran and court stenographer for the Department of the Army, in 1957. It was the second marriage for each. Edna had been briefly married in the early 1950s, when she was stationed at the U.S. Embassy in London. Burt was a widower and the couple met when both taught Sunday School at Arlington Presbyterian Church in Virginia.\n\nWhen Burt retired, the couple moved to Greeley \u2014 in Edna\u2019s case, it was a move back \u2014 in 1972 and Edna continued to work at home as a subcontracting transcriptionist until the mid-1990s.\n\nShe was active in several local groups, and she and Burt loved to square dance and travel.\n\nMary Christiansen taught for 32 years in Fairbanks before coming to Greeley to live with Edna in her final years, serving as her primary caregiver in the Middlemas\u2019 Greeley home. Edna loved going to Fat Albert\u2019s, including to celebrate birthdays, and to the Egg and I for breakfast. And as long as she was able, she went to concerts and shows.\n\n\u201cLots of people asked her, \u2018What\u2019s the secret to a long life,\u2019\u201d Christiansen said. \u201cShe always said, \u2018I\u2019m interested in living.\u2019 She didn\u2019t worry, she didn\u2019t stress, and she believed that things happened for a reason.\u201d\n\nEdna was slowed after she suffered a fractured femur last in 2017 and underwent a hip replacement at age 102, and she died on July 15.\n\nFew knew of Edna\u2019s World War II and subsequent service.\n\n\u201cI think her friends and people knew that she was a WAC during World War II,\u201d Reese said. \u201cThey knew dad had worked at the Pentagon and mom had worked at the Pentagon. But, yes, it was mostly under the radar.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just the way they were.", "Report: Spice Girls to reunite for tour, but without Beckham\n\nFILE - In this Sunday, Aug. 12, 2012 file photo, British band 'The Spice Girls' perform during the Closing Ceremony at the 2012 Summer Olympics, in London.

Results are expected later Sunday.\n\nNew Caledonia, a cluster of islands, is home to about 270,000 people. They include the native Kanaks, who represent about 40 percent of the population, people of European descent (about 27 percent) and others from Asian countries and Pacific islands.\n\nIt relies on France for defense, law enforcement, foreign affairs, justice and education, yet has a large degree of autonomy. New Caledonia receives about 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in French state subsidies every year, and many fear the economy would suffer if ties are severed.\n\nThe referendum is the result of a process that started 30 years ago to end years of violence between supporters and opponents of separating from France.\n\nThe violence, which overall claimed more than 70 lives, prompted a 1988 deal between rival loyalist and pro-independence factions. Another agreement a decade later included plans for an independence referendum.\n\nMost Kanaks have tended to back independence, while most descendants of European settlers have favored keeping the French connection.\n\nTo ensure security during the vote, additional police were sent to New Caledonia. Authorities also banned the carrying of firearms and alcohol sales immediately before and during the vote.\n\nIf voters say no to independence Sunday, the 1998 agreement allows two more self-determination referendums to be held by 2022.", "In this Oct. 1, 2018, photo, children sit in front of moldy bread in their shelter, in Aslam, Hajjah, Yemen.

(AP Photo/Hani Mohammed)\n\nCAIRO (AP) \u2014 The regional chief of the U.N. children\u2019s agency said Saturday that Yemeni authorities are making it difficult to deliver much-needed humanitarian aid and warned that impeding relief efforts could plunge the country into famine.\n\nGeert Cappelaere told The Associated Press in an interview from Yemen that recent U.S. calls for a cease-fire are imperative to ending the nearly four-year war, which pits a Saudi-led coalition against Iran-aligned rebels known as Houthis.\n\nHe visited the Red Sea port city of Hodeida and the rebel-held capital, Sanaa, over the past two days as clashes and airstrikes intensified. He said both the internationally-recognized Yemeni government and Houthi rebels \u201care not enabling us to do our work as fast as we should.\u201d\n\nCappelaere said he can\u2019t bring the best nutrition experts to the country because of delays in granting visas and that aid agencies face bureaucratic impediments the delay the import of supplies.\n\nHe criticized authorities with \u201cother interests\u201d for creating delays in the arrival and distribution of supplies, without elaborating.\n\nMost aid agencies operate in Houthi-held areas where they face movement restrictions. The rebels manipulate aid distribution by providing lists of beneficiaries and sometimes divert aid to their supporters.\n\nCappelaere\u2019s visit came shortly after the United States called for the cease-fire within 30 days. He said the situation is deteriorating, with millions unable to meet their basic needs.\n\nYemen has been at war since March 2015, when Houthis occupied northern Yemen, forcing the government into exile. Since then, a Saudi-led coalition supporting the government has blockaded the rebel-held north and waged a devastating air campaign. The U.S. has sold billions of dollars\u2019 worth of arms to Saudi Arabia and provides logistical and other support to the coalition.\n\n\u201cAn end to the conflict is ... a much-needed step but it needs to be complemented with investment and governance of this country that puts the interest of the people at the center and the interest of the children at the core of politics,\u201d Cappelaere said.\n\nThree-quarters of Yemen\u2019s 29 million people are food insecure, 1.8 million children suffer from malnutrition and 400,000 children under age 5 are at risk of death from starvation. Every 10 minutes a child dies of preventable diseases, according to UNICEF.\n\nAround 40 percent of the 400,000 are located in and around Hodeida, which has been the target of a stalled coalition offensive in recent months. The port is a key entry point for food and humanitarian aid, but the coalition says the Houthis also use it to import weapons.\n\nDuring a visit to Hodeida\u2019s main hospital, Cappelaere said he saw children suffering from severe malnutrition and others paralyzed by complications from diphtheria, an epidemic fueled by the breakdown of health services. He says many families in Hodeida cannot make it to hospitals because of airstrikes and shelling, or because they cannot afford transportation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s high time for authorities from both sides to take responsibility and enable that assistance without any conditions, without any hurdles,\u201d he said.", "RALEIGH, N.C.

(Jason Lee/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nBEIJING (AP) \u2014 Close ally China said Saturday it was willing to offer assistance to Pakistan to help it weather its current fiscal woes but that terms of such aid are still being discussed.\n\nThat followed a meeting in Beijing between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Pakistan\u2019s newly elected Prime Minister Imran Khan, who met the previous day with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nPakistan\u2019s growing fiscal crisis has raised questions about its ability to repay Chinese loans granted as part of Beiing\u2019s \u201cBelt and Road\u201d infrastructure initiative.\n\nPakistan has taken out billions of dollars in loans from China in recent years, the terms of which remain largely undisclosed. China has pledged a total of more than $60 billion to Pakistan in the form of loans and investments for roads, ports, power plants and industrial parks to build what is termed the \u201cChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor.\u201d\n\nFollowing Li\u2019s meeting with Khan, Vice Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou said the sides had \u201cmade it clear in principal that the Chinese government will provide necessary support and assistance to Pakistan in tiding over the current economic difficulties.\n\n\u201cAs for the specific measures to be taken, the competent authorities of the two sides will have detailed discussions,\u201d Kong told reporters.\n\nAnd despite Pakistan\u2019s looming balance of payments crisis, Kong said there were no plans to scale back the economic corridor, known as CPEC, although he did say it would be altered somewhat to \u201ctilt in favor of areas relating to people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no change in the number of CPEC projects. If there were to be any change, it would be an increase going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nIn response to the debt crisis, Pakistan is seeking an emergency bailout loan of $8 billion from the International Monetary Fund, which plans to send a team to Islamabad to assess the situation. It is also seeking new loans from Saudi Arabia and China. Discussions of the new funding were expected to dominate Khan\u2019s visit.\n\nFurther complicating matters, the United States, which strongly influences the IMF, has said it will not finance the repayment of Pakistan\u2019s Chinese loans.\n\nPakistani media earlier reported China was preparing a $6 billion package of aid, including loans and additional investment for CPEC.\n\nThe issue did not come up in opening remarks between Li and Khan. Li said the former cricket star\u2019s visit would \u201cfurther consolidate and develop the firm, enduring ties between our two countries.\u201d\n\nKhan responded by saying that CPEC had evolved from the concept stage to showing tangible results \u201con the ground\u201d that have \u201ccaught the imagination of the people of Pakistan.\n\n\u201cWe feel that this is a great opportunity for our country to progress, to attract investment. It gives us an opportunity to raise our standard of living (and) growth rate,\u201d Khan said.\n\nChina and Pakistan refer to themselves as \u201call-weather friends,\u201d united in their shared rivalry with mutual neighbor India. Pakistan has been among the most enthusiastic supporters of the trillion-dollar Belt and Road initiative, which seeks to re-establish China\u2019s former role as the Asian center of global trade by binding it to Europe, African, Southeast Asia and elsewhere through Chinese-financed projects.\n\nFaced with public anger over the rising cost of basic goods, Khan had initially vowed to curb borrowing, but has since proceeded with ambitious projects such as the construction of 5 million public housing units.\n\nHowever, some aspects of CPEC are undergoing change, including scaling back the development of Pakistan\u2019s Arabian Sea port of Gwadar. Agreements with Chinese power companies to supply much-needed electricity to energy-starved Pakistan have also been loudly criticized over the revolving debt costs to Pakistan.", "AP PHOTOS: A selection of pictures from the past week\n\nStudents from the Yeshiva School in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, react as the funeral procession for Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz passes their school en route to the Homewood Cemetery following a funeral service at the Jewish Community Center, Tuesday Oct. 30, 2018.

Then Wildcats safety Jarrius Wallace missed on an interception attempt, clearing the way for Travon McMillian\u2019s 57-yard touchdown.\n\nLucas Havrisik hit a 55-yard field goal on the final play of the first half to put Arizona up 26-24.\n\nTate kept firing in the second half, hitting Poindexter on a 39-yard touchdown in the third, and Cedric Peterson on a 57-yard score in the fourth to cap the scoring.\n\nMontez found Tony Brown on a 20-yard TD pass in the third, but threw an interception in the end zone with five minutes left.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nOnce considered a front-runner in the Pac-12 South, Colorado now must win one of its final three games just to become bowl eligible.\n\nArizona is clicking on offense at just the right time, moving within a game of becoming bowl eligible in its first season under Sumlin.\n\nPINCH KICKER\n\nColorado seemed to be in a bind with kicker James Stefanou missing his third straight game due to a hip injury and Evan Price not making the trip due to an illness.\n\nFreshman walk-on Tyler Francis handled the pressure just fine.\n\nTold he would play just the day before, Francis hit field goals from 48 and 25 yards, and made all four of his extra points in his first collegiate action \u2014 in a Pac-12 road game, no less.\n\n\u201cWhat he did today was pretty amazing,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cThat was sharp, that kid stepping up like that.\u201d\n\nPENALTY PROBLEMS\n\nArizona put itself in some tough positions due to a litany of penalties.\n\nThe Wildcats had 12 penalties for 129 yards, including multiple pass interference calls on deep balls.

(AP) \u2014 Gulf Power has a disaster fund to pay for the thousands of out-of-state linemen and extra equipment needed to rebuild Bay County\u2019s electrical system after Hurricane Michael.\n\nBut whether that fund can cover the whole recovery cost isn\u2019t yet known.\n\n\u201cNone of that has been thought about yet,\u201d Jeff Rogers, spokesman for Gulf Power, said of the total cost to restore electricity. \u201cWe\u2019ve been focused only on restoration ... but over the next couple of weeks we\u2019ll get more information.\u201d\n\nRogers said the company has a disaster fund set up with the state to pay for situations like the hurricane, which knocked out power in the county three weeks ago. Money for the fund comes from portions of customers\u2019 electricity bills, Rogers said.\n\n\u201cIf there isn\u2019t enough in the fund, we may go to the state to ask for more,\u201d Rogers said.\n\nRogers said power companies across the country have similar disaster funds that pay for visiting repair crews and equipment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always the host company that pays for it,\u201d Rogers said of disaster recovery. \u201cLike when we travel, the host company picks up the tab.\u201d\n\nRobert Barnes, a Panama City native who now lives in Vernon, said he saw people on the social media site Facebook complaining about Gulf Power but praising visiting crews. Thinking that Gulf Power was being unfairly criticized, Barnes asked The News Herald through its Bay Asked, We Answered series: \u201cWho pays for all of the out-of-state power company crews, equipment and supplies?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to get some factual information out there about what they\u2019ve done,\u201d Barnes said about Gulf Power. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a hell of a job getting things back up and running.\u201d\n\nRogers said that to date, power was restored to almost everyone in the county who can receive electricity. Still, there\u2019s an estimated 15,000 customers whose homes and buildings are too damaged to accept power, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s destroyed equipment, it\u2019s all over ... mostly in the hardest hit areas,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cBut, we\u2019ve got people getting repairs every day.\u201d\n\nRogers noted that with the major restoration complete, most of the visiting linemen had left the county. More than 7,000 people from power companies across the country were in the county at the peak of the repair effort.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve probably got about 1,500 now,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cNow we\u2019re in the cleanup phase, making sure repairs were done correctly and checking for possible weak points.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The (Panama City, Fla.)

Pollock (Diamondbacks) and catcher Yasmani Grandal (Dodgers).\n\nPlayers have until Nov. 12 to accept. If a team makes a qualifying offer to a player who signs a major league contract with another club before the June amateur draft, his former club would receive a draft pick as compensation at the end of the first round.\n\nOnly five of 73 players given qualifying offers have accepted since the process began in 2012.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs exercised their $20 million option on left-hander Cole Hamels, who went 4-3 with a 2.36 ERA in 12 starts after he was acquired from Texas on July 27. The Cubs traded left-hander Drew Smyly to the Rangers, clearing his $7 million salary from the payroll. That is $1 million more than the Rangers would have owed the Cubs if Hamels\u2019 option had been declined, which would have triggered a $6 million buyout and allowed him to go free.\n\nKershaw terminated a $215 million, seven-year contract that had $65 million remaining at $32 million next year and $33 million in 2020. The new deal calls for a $23 million signing bonus, payable in equal installments on June 30 in each of the next three years, and annual salaries of $23,333,333.

He is 11-9 with a 3.55 ERA in 195 minor league appearances.\n\nThe 26-year-old Dixon made his big league debut with Cincinnati, hitting .178 this year in 74 games.

But the team opted against such a move, not wanting to give the outfielder \u2014 who turns 35 this month \u2014 the option of taking such a lucrative deal.\n\nWhile Markakis was a first-time All-Star who hit .297 with 14 homers and 93 RBIs, his production tailed off in the second half of the season.\n\nBASKETBALL\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Cavaliers All-Star forward Kevin Love will be out at least six weeks \u2014 and maybe longer \u2014 after surgery on his left foot.\n\nLove had the operation on Friday in New York at the Hospital for Special Surgery.

(Martti Kainulainen/Lehtikuva via AP)\n\nAleksander Barkov is quick to point out the NHL is so popular in Finland that tickets to two games in Helsinki sold out in less than five minutes.\n\n\u201cIt shows how much they love the game,\u201d the Florida Panthers captain said. \u201cThere\u2019s good reason to do that every year.\u201d\n\nThe NHL is planning just that after Commissioner Gary Bettman announced initial plans for a 2019 season-opener in Prague, two regular-season games in Stockholm and exhibitions in Germany and Switzerland. The Panthers and Winnipeg Jets played the 24th and 25th regular-season games outside North America on Thursday and Friday at a packed Hartwall Arena in the Finnish capital.\n\nAs the league sows seeds of interest in new markets like China, it is also continuing to cultivate interest in established hockey countries like Sweden, Finland and the Czech Republic. And there\u2019s a modest proposal for continuing to stoke the interest in the sport in Scandinavia and across Europe.\n\n\u201cOne thing that I know former players have been talking about is maybe more games earlier on the weekends so they can actually watch,\u201d said Washington Capitals center Nicklas Backstrom, who is Swedish. \u201cPrime time here is middle of the night there. To make it more popular in Europe and Sweden, I think more games in the middle of the day on the weekends would be great. That\u2019s how you can get it more popular.\u201d\n\nA crowded sports calendar in the U.S. with the NFL and college football going on during the first half of the season makes that a challenge. Not counting the three games this season taking place in Europe, just 127 regular-season NHL games \u2014 roughly 10 percent of the full schedule \u2014 start early enough in North America that fans in places in Western and Central Europe can watch before a late evening bedtime.\n\nEven with games on Thursday, Sunday and Monday nights to fill prime-time spots in the U.S., traditional Sunday afternoon kickoffs have helped the NFL become bigger in Europe. Games at Wembley Stadium in London feature fans in jerseys of just about every team, not just the two playing, and the influence goes beyond England.\n\n\u201cIn Denmark, the NFL (became) quite popular like 10, 15 years ago because they started games in the afternoon, so people could start watching at dinner time and they could just keep watching a new game,\u201d Capitals center Lars Eller said. \u201cI would welcome more afternoon games.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cNHL on NBC\u201d games that start at 12:30 p.m. Eastern on Sunday largely after the American football season ends fit that bill. And with more teams choosing to skip morning skates altogether, afternoon starts wouldn\u2019t throw off game-day routines to the point that there\u2019s pushback from players.\n\n\u201cWhenever that happens, games at 12 or 1 p.m. Eastern time, it\u2019s like 7 o\u2019clock in Finland or (nighttime) in Europe, so people can see,\u201d Barkov said. \u201cOf course there\u2019s a big audience there.\u201d\n\nBettman said he is not sure hockey can grow more in places like Sweden and Finland where there are already strong domestic leagues and a steady flow of talented players reaching the NHL.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is continue to work to keep it at the extraordinarily high level that it\u2019s at,\u201d he said.\n\nBettman and Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly brushed aside the idea of basing an NHL team in Europe, saying it would need to be a group of teams and that no one has come up with a viable plan. They said staging an outdoor game in Europe is a possibility but not something likely to happen soon.\n\nMore likely is a regular schedule of \u201cGlobal Series\u201d games across Europe. Since the NHL opened the 1997-98 season in Japan, 24 of 31 teams have played overseas. The Philadelphia Flyers, New York Islanders, Dallas Stars, Toronto Maple Leafs, Montreal Canadiens, Vegas Golden Knights and defending Stanley Cup champion Capitals are the only ones left. Probably not for long.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to share our game,\u201d Bettman said in Helsinki. \u201cWe\u2019d like to continue to encourage the enthusiasm, support and development that hockey gets by bringing the world\u2019s best players and the world\u2019s best league over here.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Karel Janicek in Helsinki contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Protesters shout slogans during a rally to condemn a Supreme Court decision that acquitted Asia Bibi, a Christian woman, who spent eight years on death row accused of blasphemy, in Lahore, Pakistan, Friday, Nov. 2, 2018.

Malook\u2019s phone was switched off.\n\nPakistan\u2019s top court acquitted Bibi on Wednesday and ordered her release in a move that infuriated the country\u2019s hard-line Islamists, who have held nationwide protests demanding her execution.\n\nThe government reached deal with the Islamists overnight in which it agreed to impose a travel ban on Bibi while the case is reviewed. In return, the Islamists halted their protests, which had blocked roads and brought life to a standstill in parts of the country.\n\nMalook told The Associated Press earlier this week that he would have to leave Pakistan because the followers of hard-line cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi had threatened to kill him as well as the judges who acquitted Bibi.\n\nThe Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported that Malook passed through Rome en route to Amsterdam.

Islamists have made the blasphemy law a central rallying cry.\n\nSalman Taseer, the governor of Punjab province, was shot and killed by one of his guards in 2011 for defending Bibi and criticizing the misuse of the law. The assassin, Mumtaz Qadri, was hanged for the crime, but later was hailed by religious hard-liners as a martyr, with millions visiting a shrine set up for him near Islamabad. Malook had served as the prosecutor in Qadri\u2019s trial.\n\nBibi was arrested in 2009 on allegations that she insulted Islam\u2019s Prophet Muhammad during an altercation with other farmworkers. Her family and lawyers deny she ever insulted Islam.\n\nRights groups have called for Bibi\u2019s release and criticized the blasphemy law, saying it has been used to settle scores or abuse religious minorities. The court upheld the blasphemy law, but said there was not enough evidence to convict Bibi.\n\nPakistan\u2019s Supreme Court has not been known to reverse its decisions, but court reviews typically take years. Bibi\u2019s ordeal looks set to continue until the review is completed.\n\nBibi\u2019s family had expected her release by Thursday night.

But it takes just a half-second talking to those who knew him to learn he was so much more.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I really needed to know him very long to get to know what the kid was about,\u201d said Rocky Burkett, LeMair\u2019s head wrestling coach at Northern State.\n\nThe two had been in contact since the spring of the wrestler\u2019s junior year of high school in Shakopee, Minnesota.\n\n\u201cI got an email from him, and the email just jumped out,\u201d Burkett recalled. \u201cThe kid was excited about wrestling, about possibly being at Northern State ... we were emailing back and forth and every time he\u2019d respond that he was just excited.\u201d\n\nBurkett wasn\u2019t disappointed when he got LeMair on campus.\n\n\u201cCurtis was a kid \u2014 he believed,\u201d Burkett said.\n\nIt seems too perfect, but Burkett\u2019s hopes for LeMair were about as high as a wrestling coach\u2019s hopes can be. He invoked names attached to faces on the walls of the Barnett Center when he talked about what he thought this kid could have become.\n\n\u201cEverybody loved this kid,\u201d Burkett said. \u201cMinnesota is a pretty tough wrestling state, and you talk about the best wrestlers in Minnesota, they all love Curtis LeMair. He was going to be our ambassador.\u201d\n\nHe was already impacting his teammates in the few short months he was on campus.\n\nUnanimous recollections were twofold: LeMair\u2019s work ethic; LeMair\u2019s smile.\n\n\u201cHis smile,\u201d said freshman teammate Adam DeBoer. \u201cI don\u2019t know, he had the ability to turn one of the worst days into one of the best days.\u201d\n\nThat smile was the first thing remembered by fellow freshman Brandon Sharkey \u2014 someone who\u2019d have had to compete with LeMair, being in the same weight class.\n\n\u201cI could go on for days,\u201d Sharkey said. \u201cHe had a smile on his face everywhere he went. He could bring a light into a room.\u201d\n\nAnd then, there was the wrestling.\n\n\u201cHardest worker I ever met in my life,\u201d Sharkey said. \u201cHe really loved the sport of wrestling.\u201d\n\nDeBoer echoed those thoughts.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always pushing other people so they push to their fullest potential,\u201d DeBoer said. \u201cHe was always trying to reach his full potential, working extra hard after practice, getting stuff on the bike. I only knew him a couple months, but we were together probably every day since stepping foot on campus. Every day was great with him. He was always making other people smile.\n\n\u201cSeeing him go so quick \u2014 that\u2019s not a smile you can forget about. His attitude toward life, not just wrestling, he always had good, positive vibes toward everything.\u201d\n\nInitial autopsy findings point to an undetected genetic heart condition as the likely cause of death, Aberdeen American News reported.\n\nThe Wolves are down a 141-pounder, yes, but someone like LeMair doesn\u2019t disappear without a trace.\n\n\u201cEverything we do now is for him,\u201d DeBoer said. \u201cWe knew that he was 100 percent Northern State. He was here to wrestle hard. He had respect from the community and he gave respect to the community, and everything we do this season is for him. We wouldn\u2019t want to do it for anyone else.\u201d\n\nThe team hung up a pair of LeMair\u2019s wrestling boots on one of the pull-up bars in the wrestling room.\n\n\u201cI was struggling a couple days back,\u201d Sharkey said. \u201d(The team was) saying, \u2018Let\u2019s get back in the room and get going, that\u2019s what Curtis would want.\u2019 And I believe 100 percent that\u2019s what he\u2019d want. But I was struggling in practice, and I looked up and saw Curtis\u2019s wrestling shoes hanging up in the room. That gave me the extra go. Knowing Curtis would want us to go as hard as we could, that\u2019s going to take us to the next level.\u201d\n\nBurkett, incredibly, spoke to LeMair at length on the phone the day before the wrestler was found dead in the Great Plains East residence hall on campus.\n\nTraveling to visit a recruit, Burkett called his relatively recent signee, LeMair, and asked him why he came to Northern State and what Burkett should tell this recruit who was waffling in his commitment decision.\n\n\u201cI talked to Curtis that day, just talking about what makes Northern special,\u201d Burkett recalled. \u201cHe just kept talking about \u2014 his parents have a hunting lodge in Hoven \u2014 he loved the community. He said I should call his dad, and I\u2019ve talked to his dad before, but his dad was talking about the community support, Northern, how special it is, and how people treat their student-athletes. That\u2019s what\u2019s so special. I got (back to Aberdeen for) the end of practice that night, talked to Curtis, seeing how he was doing. So weird.\n\n\u201cThe next day, I\u2019m going into practice that morning, his roommate called me, he\u2019d called 911. I\u2019m going into his room, seeing him there, talking to 911, and he\u2019s dead. Why did I talk to him that day? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate the loss to the team, both from a wrestling and a personality standpoint. It\u2019s visible on Burkett\u2019s face and audible in his voice how much the wrestler meant to his team and to his coach.\n\nBut it\u2019s not hard to understand the size of the impact his brief arrival and sudden departure leave on the members of the program.\n\n\u201cHe had a huge heart,\u201d Burkett said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what took him. Heart was too big.

After eighth grade, they may attend either Mandan or New Salem schools.\n\nSweet Briar School Board President Travis Wolf, whose children, father and grandfather attended there as he did, said the one-on-one interactions between teachers and students allow for as good an education as anywhere.\n\nTechnology helps, especially with grant money available. The yellow stucco schoolhouse built in 1936 \u2014 the school dates to at least 1913 \u2014 has a ton of gadgets for its students. IPads. Chromebooks. Green screen. Smartboard projection. Lego robotics. Claymation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not at want for any of the techie stuff,\u201d said Johnson, who teaches fourth- through eighth-grade. \u201cYou just have to keep up with it, professional development-wise.\u201d\n\nAs the school enters a new era of steady growth, Johnson will be stepping away. She\u2019s retiring after 11 years at Sweet Briar School as the principal/teacher, with 13 years before that at the Almont school. She lives just 20 miles away on a farm and ranch and will be available for substitute teaching.\n\nHer eyes glisten when recounting her advocacy for rural schools over the years \u2014 testifying every two years on legislation that would close rural schools in favor of K-12 institutions.\n\n\u201cWe just said, when the time is right, we\u2019ll know when it\u2019s time to close, and it\u2019s not right to take the option, the choice away from parents to have a smaller, close-knit, one-on-one ratio, rural education,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nNorth Dakota Superintendent of Public Instruction Kirsten Baesler said she senses virtually no appetite from lawmakers to address rural schools as in years past. Local control will decide their fate, she said \u2014 for example, Amidon\u2019s school district recently decided to dissolve after this school year, by board decision.\n\nImprovements in classroom technology, athletic consolidations, even better snowplows have likely contributed to the continuation of rural schools, Baesler added.\n\nRural students also aren\u2019t less socially advantaged than their city counterparts, according to Johnson, who said classroom technology, extracurricular and family activities provide the same opportunities for Sweet Briar\u2019s student body.\n\nKatie Dahly, who\u2019s taught kindergarten through third grade at Sweet Briar School for six years, said there are different advantages with the small, rural setting.\n\n\u201cYou get the same kids four years in a row, so if you know they aren\u2019t learning something one year, and the next year comes, that\u2019s what they\u2019re learning,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can grow with them, rather than have them a year and send them off to a different teacher.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s certainly no gap in her and Johnson\u2019s credentials: Dahly recently attained her master\u2019s degree in differentiated education, while Johnson holds a master\u2019s degree in health science.\n\nThe close interactions between grade levels also are a plus at Sweet Briar. Seventh-grader Kendra Tomac said she likes the \u201cfamily\u201d atmosphere of the school, where her younger sister and brother also attend.\n\n\u201cWe get to help out the little kids a lot,\u201d she said.\n\nAs enrollment increases, Wolf said the school board is considering its options. Growth is a \u201cchallenge,\u201d he said. Finding a new teacher after Johnson\u2019s retirement shouldn\u2019t be a difficult task, if the candidates understand the setting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had pretty good luck finding teachers,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fortunate to find very good teachers for our students all the time. I hope we can do it again.\u201d\n\nDahly, who lives in Bismarck and substitute-taught before her Sweet Briar years, said the school\u2019s setting and close-knit community appeal to her.\n\n\u201cJust all around, it\u2019s a good school and a good place to be,\u201d said Dahly, adding that Johnson\u2019s mentorship has helped.\n\nSeventh-grader Nate McHugh said the small school makes it easy to make friends. Next year, he\u2019ll have four siblings at Sweet Briar when his sister joins him and three brothers.\n\nJohnson pointed out McHugh\u2019s interest in math and engineering and how he led a group project in building the model airplanes hanging from her classroom\u2019s ceiling. Just one more opportunity that comes with a small school, she said.\n\nBecky Griffin, who started this fall as an instructional aide, also attended Sweet Briar as a child, and agreed the schoolhouse is a \u201cspecial place.\u201d She drives 20 miles every morning to take two of her children to the rural school.\n\n\u201cI just knew how special this environment was, and so it was worth the drive to get the kids here,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com", "IDAHO FALLS, Idaho (AP) \u2014 A young falcon circled around a sagebrush and cheatgrass field south of Arco on Thursday when a few sage grouse burst from the ground. The chase was on. The falcon closed the gap and hit one of the grouse, but not hard enough to do any damage and the grouse flew away.\n\n\u201cThat was exciting,\u201d a bystander said. \u201cThe falcon was not high enough to hit the bird hard enough.\u201d\n\nWatching a falcon close on a game bird is quite a sight. Peregrine falcons are the world\u2019s fastest birds with some having been clocked at more than 220 miles per hour.\n\nLast weekend, a couple of dozen falconers gathered in Arco for the Idaho Falconers Association\u2019s annual fall meetup, the Post Register reported. They gathered in the morning for breakfast at Pickle\u2019s Place to talk shop and exchange notes on where to hunt, then headed out to various places to test their birds against rabbits, grouse and waterfowl.\n\nIn the case of the unsuccessful falcon, the owner was pleased with what he saw.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a young bird,\u201d said Rick Guritzky of Weston. \u201cThey get beat, beat and beat until they figure it out. It\u2019s good for them. I like his enthusiasm. It shows he\u2019s enjoying it.\u201d\n\nThe gathering of Idaho falconers takes place every fall in the Arco area and this year\u2019s was organized by Idaho Falls falconer Stephen Buffat. The casual affair sees people from across the West sharing meals and swapping gear. Idaho Falconers president Brad Smoot lives in Arco, mostly for the area\u2019s opportunities to fly his birds.\n\n\u201cI met my wife out on the desert hawkin\u2019 grouse,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lifestyle for us.\u201d\n\nSmoot said he changed careers from a construction manager to a nurse at the Arco hospital \u201cso I could do this.\u201d\n\nWhile falconers are a small group \u2014 Smoot estimates perhaps 150 active in the state and about 5,000 nationwide \u2014 they are passionate. Many also run bird dogs to aid their birds\u2019 success. The falconers\u2019 birds take the place of a gun for a typical hunter, but instead of putting the gun away at the end of the season, birds must be cared for year-round.\n\n\u201cLook at the size of the Big Desert and you\u2019ll see why you want to run a dog (to hunt with birds),\u201d Guritzky said.\n\nIn the case of Thursday morning\u2019s hunt, the falconers released their bird dogs to flush out more sage grouse, but once again, the falcon was out of place and unable to take advantage of another half-dozen birds flying up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d Guritzky said. \u201cThe bird will eventually learn to work with the dogs and he\u2019ll have success.\u201d\n\nThe craft of falconry is centuries old. Across the nation and in Idaho, falconers hunt with the birds under strict guidelines and purchase a license just like other hunters do. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game annually inspects a falconer\u2019s home setup to make sure everything is up to snuff. Buffat and Smoot emphasized that falconers were instrumental in bringing the endangered birds back from the brink of extinction. The birds were federally protected in the United States in the 1970s due to use of the pesticide DDT. Peregrine falcons, Idaho\u2019s state bird, were removed from the Endangered Species List in 1999. Now the birds are common again.\n\nKelly Smoot said she gathered falcons from a nest where birds were typically killed each year by predators. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t, none would have survived,\u201d she said.\n\nThe birds often are kept for one season and released in the spring after the hunting season is over and the bird can join the normal migration.\n\n\u201cBy doing that, you gave that bird a huge advantage,\u201d Buffat said. \u201cNow it has hunting skills and ability, it has made it through the hardest part of its life being well fed and taken care of and it can take those skills back into the wild with it and be a success.\u201d\n\nBuffat said only about 20 percent of raptors in the wild survive their first winter, but if they survive they generally live for several years.\n\nOn Thursday, falconers took care to weigh their birds before releasing them for the hunt. They know each bird\u2019s optimum weight. Too heavy and it won\u2019t be interested; too light and it might fly away looking for a meal and never return, or not have the energy to fly.\n\nJason Bosen, of Utah, was flying Harris hawks Thursday morning in pursuit of rabbits. The hawks stay close to their handlers, often launching off of poles carried above the owners head.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like falcons,\u201d Bosen said. \u201cThey fly off and you spend all day chasing after them. A good day is when you return with your dog and your bird. When you also get some game, that\u2019s a bonus.\u201d\n\nWhen Bosen was done hunting, he put on a leather glove and called to his hawks. The birds flew to his hand and he returned them to his truck.\n\nMost falconers attach a tiny GPS radio transmitter to their birds. A few years ago, they used radio transmitters, often with limited success. New GPS trackers link with smartphones and iPads to pinpoint a bird exactly on a map.\n\n\u201cCompared to GPS, the (old radio systems) was crap,\u201d Brad Smoot said. \u201cNow I can see exactly where my bird is.\u201d\n\nBuffat said he wished he had GPS years ago, while hunting west of Roberts for sage grouse.\n\n\u201cMy falcon came down and smacked a sage grouse and knocked it to the ground, but sage grouse that time of the year are particularly tough and the bird got up and took off flying and my falcon took off after it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was 9 in the morning. I looked all day long using the conventional radio telemetry with no avail. It was getting dark and I had basically gone several hundred miles looking for my bird and couldn\u2019t find it. I checked one last spot up by Terreton, 15 miles away and got a really strong signal. I found my bird. It had been grabbed by an eagle and killed and carried 15 miles and dropped in the bushes. The eagle wasn\u2019t even hungry, it was being territorial. But I was able to find it and get some closure.\u201d\n\nFalconers sometimes fly eagles. The big birds are brought to them for rehabilitation after injury or illness. Falconers must take care to keep the birds apart to prevent fatalities.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t believe how powerful eagles are,\u201d Guritzky said. \u201cI believe two men with vise grips couldn\u2019t pull those talons off your arm.\u201d\n\nFalconers also use other high-tech gear to aid their hobby. Smoot attached a dangling lure from a drone that he flew to a specific height over the Arco desert. With each drone session, the bird is urged to fly a little higher \u2014 getting the bird in flying shape and teaching it to get up high enough to zoom back to earth with enough speed and force to take out a real target.\n\nOne thing falconers can do that other hunters can\u2019t is operate close to urban areas. They are often hired to patrol airports, orchards and vineyards to keep pesky birds away.\n\n\u201cA bird through a jet engine is gonna cost $100,000,\u201d said one falconer who had been hired to chase seagulls from an airport in California.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Post Register, http://www.postregister.com", "In this Wednesday, Oct. 24, 2018 photo, Smudge Bear prepares a campaign sign supporting Julian Bear Runner as Wichapi To CrookedEyes, 8, and Stewie, a puppy, hang out in Wounded Knee, S.D., on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. As with state and municipal races across the country, elections for tribal candidates on the Pine Ridge reservation are in full swing for the Nov. 6 election. (Ryan Hermens/Rapid City Journal via AP)\n\nPINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) \u2014 Warren Blue Bird walks down the row of signs hanging from a chain-link fence at the busy intersection of Highway 18 in Pine Ridge, forecasting each election.\n\n\u201cPeri Pourier, she wants to be in the district house in Pierre,\u201d he yells out, over passing semi traffic. \u201cRed Dawn Foster, I campaigned for her last year, but I don\u2019t think she got in. Carlow is just right up the road. And there\u2019s Julian Bear Runner. He\u2019s my relative.\u201d\n\nThe Bear Runner banner reads: \u201cCommon Man with a Plan.\u201d\n\nAs with state and municipal races across the country, elections for tribal candidates on the Pine Ridge reservation are in full swing for the Nov. 6 election. The most visible sign is, well, the colorful, often handmade campaign signs dotting the ditches, hanging from post office walls or painted onto stacked hay bales across the reservation.\n\n\u201cWe do what we can with what we have,\u201d said Peri Pourier, a Navy veteran and Democrat running for the Legislature in District 27, which stretches from the reservation up to ranch country west of Philip and then nearly to the Missouri River. \u201cBeing Lakota, you make do.\u201d\n\nAfter Pourier announced her candidacy, her father found some recycled plywood, a pail of red paint and began making 12 signs that were labors of love, the Rapid City Journal reported.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a one-man wrecking ball,\u201d said Chase Iron Eyes, campaign manager for Julian Bear Runner, who is running for president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe.\n\nNear the post office in Porcupine, Pourier gets out of a truck. She\u2019d driven up to Rapid City \u2014 roughly 90 minutes \u2014 for an interview with the public radio station.\n\n\u201cMy father is on limited income. He can\u2019t work. He actually has a bone disease and has a hard time getting around,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he believes in this so much. There\u2019s one on a back road near Slim Buttes, one near Chadron, and way out in Wanblee. He was feeling inspired.\u201d\n\nOn the road to Wolf Creek School, a white sign in black paint reads, \u201cVote Tom Poor Bear Vice President.\u201d Near some horses on the highway, \u201cVote Duane Syrup Big Crow Wakpamni Council.\u201d North of Pine Ridge, there\u2019s a hay bale with candidate Maggie Ross for District 27 House,\u201d which includes a painted turtle.\n\nMost are for Democrats, the dominant political party on South Dakota\u2019s reservations. But at Big Batt\u2019s, a gas stop in the heart of Pine Ridge, a banner is up for the two Republican candidates for the Legislature \u2014 Elizabeth May and Steve Livermont. They\u2019re digitally printed.\n\nOut toward Wounded Knee, Bear Runner, the 33-year-old presidential candidate who made a name during the protest at Standing Rock nearly two years ago, pulls over his truck \u2014 the back is filled with candy for kids and an empty backseat that he says is for hitchhikers \u2014 and he points to his big sign along the highway.\n\n\u201cWe hit the clearance aisle at Menard\u2019s to pick up the spray paint and the plywood, and I got those Christmas lights at Walmart (in Rapid City),\u201d he said.\n\nRules for campaigns are different on Pine Ridge. There are no campaign finance laws, and candidates often rely on small donations. There are also no laws against placing signs in roadway right of ways. The only rule is signs can\u2019t obstruct motorists\u2019 views and can\u2019t be near memorial sites.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you won\u2019t see any in Wounded Knee,\u201d said Pourier. \u201cNot near the memorial, at least.\u201d\n\nDown a cul-de-sac inside the village of Wounded Knee, Bear Runner\u2019s sign-making operation is going strong with Savannah Begay and Smudge Bear, who both came to the Dakotas during the pipeline protests and have remained as residents, churning out red, white and blue signs reading, \u201cVOTE Bear Runner O.S.T. President.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an artist if that\u2019s what\u2019s needed,\u201d said Begay, whose flower scarf gets pulled up over her face when she uses spray paint. Beneath her on the grass, near a pine shelter used by the family for butchering, Begay has set out 2-foot by 2-foot plywood slides.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be like the Hollywood sign,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to find a big hill for it.\u201d\n\nBegay said she heard Bear Runner speak and was drawn to the way he spoke practically about the tribe\u2019s issues. A puppy, Stewie, tracks muddy paw prints over the plywood slabs painted white and then trots over to lap up water from a divot in the driveway, while Bear Runner smokes a cigarette and talks about the support he\u2019s received.\n\n\u201cI heard from a grandfather in Wanblee. He said, \u2018Julian, when you get in there (to the president\u2019s office) you need to help with housing. We\u2019ve got nine families living here. Will you help us?\u2019\u201d\n\nBear Runner\u2019s opponent \u2014 Richard Zephier \u2014 is in his 70s and has a deep background in tribal administration, serving previously as executive director for OST. Most of Zephier\u2019s signs are printed and feature his smiling face. Bear Runner worries about having some of his signs torn down by opponents, so he\u2019s waiting until the campaign\u2019s last week to \u201cbombard\u201d the countryside with his name.\n\nIn recent weeks, national news has followed the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to not take up a court case out of North Dakota requiring voters show an address when voting \u2014 an arguably prohibitive voting requirement for many residents of reservations who often use P.O. boxes and sometimes move from residence to residence. Voting on Pine Ridge, as well, is complicated by the fact that the tribal precincts don\u2019t jive with state precincts.\n\n\u201cIf you live on the west side of Wounded Knee, you may need to drive all the way up to Singing Horse Trading Post to vote for the state election,\u201d which is roughly eight miles from the voting precinct in Wounded Knee for the tribal elections. For people with limited resources, Pourier said, these barriers just make voting that much more difficult.\n\nDriving, however, is a staple of life on the reservation, which makes the election signs an effective way to campaign.\n\n\u201cWe have to drive everywhere,\u201d Pourier said. \u201cIf you want medicine, you need to drive to Pine Ridge. If you want to go to the grocery store, there are three on the reservation, which is roughly the size of Connecticut. You need to drive. We\u2019re always in our cars. That\u2019s why these signs go where people can see them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s strategic,\u201d said Bear Runner, \u201cI put my signs up where they\u2019ll get the most attention, usually on the roadways.\u201d\n\nAt the house in Wounded Knee, where the sign-making operation will continue up to election day, Begay\u2019s aunt has cooked soup and made fry bread. Friends come and go, saying hello to Bear Runner, who would be one of the youngest presidents of OST if elected. As Begay pulls back the painter\u2019s tape covering the white plywood, the bright red \u201cB\u2033 spray looks almost orange.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for shopping the clearance aisle,\u201d said Bear Runner to laughs. He tells the visitors to drive toward Porcupine, where one of his signs is draped in Christmas lights with a lantern pointed toward it, so it stays lit-up at night.\n\n\u201cI just want to give people something to be inspired in,\u201d said Bear Runner. \u201cOn the reservation, you\u2019ve got to see to believe, you know?\u201d\n\nHe briefly lifts up one of the arsenal of posts that\u2019ll hold the signs high in a grassy ditch and talks about the color scheme.\n\n\u201cI chose red, white and blue because they\u2019re patriotic colors,\u201d said Bear Runner, an Army veteran, who keeps an Oglala Sioux Tribe stocking cap pulled down just over his eyes. Asked whether he means \u201cpatriotism\u201d of the United States or of Oglala Sioux Tribes, he doesn\u2019t flinch for a second.\n\n\u201cBoth.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Rapid City Journal, http://www.rapidcityjournal.com", "TOWN CREEK, Ala. (AP) \u2014 Whenever DJ Jones would visit the small town by the creek in north Lawrence County to see family, he used to always swing by the football field where he once played.\n\nHis last game at Hazlewood\u2019s Golden Bear Stadium was a 21-20 playoff loss to Talladega County Central to end the 12-1 2007 season. The school was closed after one more season and eventually the home bleachers were moved to R.A. Hubbard.\n\n\u201cIt just wouldn\u2019t look right without the home bleachers so I stopped going by,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI just can\u2019t look at it anymore.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a decade since the last Hazlewood football team rumbled across the grass at Golden Bear Stadium. The only rumbling today, outside of some youth soccer and youth football, is from the trains that speed past just behind the scoreboard that sits beyond the north end zone.\n\nThe school\u2019s colors of purple and gold are still splashed throughout the stadium, but the paint has seen better days. The shattered glass in the press box looks like someone has used the windows for target practice. It\u2019s a different look from how it was Nov. 14, 2008, when Speake beat Hazlewood, 7-6, in the Class 1A playoffs.\n\nIt\u2019s a sad scene for a place where one of the most successful high school football programs in the state called home. The Golden Bears won 11 state championships from 1970-2000 under five different head coaches. They won five in a row from 1988-1992.\n\n\u201cIt was unbelievable. I really can\u2019t describe it. You had to be part of it to totally understand it,\u201d Rickey Johnson said. He was head coach for four state champions.\n\nThe school was blessed with talent and that led to a mindset of high expectations. After taking the Class 1A state championship in 1981, the school requested to be moved up to Class 2A in order to face better competition. The Golden Bears got their wish and then went 13-0 to win the Class 2A state championship in 1982.\n\nThe field where so many great players performed is still considered sacred ground by many. When Guin Holland, who coached the 1970 state championship team, died in 2015 his family had his ashes spread at midfield.\n\n___\n\nWealth of greatness\n\nGreat players were never in short supply at Hazlewood. The school had 106 All-State players. There was a pipeline of talent to the SEC led by the Goode brothers to Alabama.\n\nKerry Goode made Town Creek famous when a national television audience in 1984 watched him score three touchdowns and roll up 297 all-purpose yards in a little over one half vs. a Boston College team that featured Doug Flutie, that season\u2019s Heisman Trophy winner.\n\n\u201cEverybody in Lawrence County swelled up with pride that night,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe was one of us showing the country how we played football.\u201d\n\nKerry\u2019s younger brother Pierre was Alabama\u2019s Mr. Football in 1985. The list of players from Hazlewood named the Class 2A Player of the Year between 1982-1995 included Kerry and Pierre along with Tony Harris, Montoya Madden, Chris Hood and Courtney Rose.\n\nHarris played at Ole Miss and Mississippi State. Madden and Hood played at Alabama. Rose played at Auburn.\n\nIt was Hazlewood\u2019s Antonio Langham, who turned the tide in the first SEC Championship Game when he returned an interception late in the game against Florida for an Alabama touchdown. That win gave the Crimson Tide the opportunity to beat Miami in the Sugar Bowl to become the 1992 national champions.\n\nLangham is one of seven Golden Bears, including Kerry and Chris Goode, who made it to the NFL.\n\n\u201cThe difference between the kids at Hazlewood was hard work and dedication,\u201d said Aaron Goode, who was the school\u2019s last head football coach. \u201cHaving speed didn\u2019t hurt. It made everybody better no matter what position they played. You got faster just trying to keep up.\u201d\n\nAaron Goode played on the 1970 state championship team. He is an uncle to the Goode brothers. He coached state championship teams at his alma mater in track and basketball.\n\n___\n\nDeath sentence\n\nAfter several years of dealing with financial troubles, the Lawrence County School Board decided to cut the number of high schools from seven to four. Hazlewood, along with Speake and Mount Hope, got the news before the 2008 school year.\n\nHazlewood merged with R.A. Hubbard in North Courtland. It was also decided that the Chiefs mascot and orange and black colors from Courtland would carry over to the new R.A. Hubbard High School.\n\n\u201cIt was like mixing oil and water,\u201d Town Creek resident Doug Russell said. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t going to work. They thought they were taking two small schools and creating a powerhouse. Instead they really destroyed both schools.\u201d\n\nRather than make the move, several Hazlewood students left for other schools. Muscle Shoals head coach Scott Basden has admitted that the timing of the closing of Hazlewood had a positive impact on the rise of his football program starting in 2009.\n\n___\n\nDevastated community\n\nTown Creek is a community with around 1,000 residents, according to Mayor Mike Parker. The school was named Hazlewood to honor the family that donated land for the school.\n\n\u201cA school is the center of the community, and that\u2019s the way it was here,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWhen they closed the high school, it was devastating. It\u2019s really set us back. I can\u2019t remember the last house built in Town Creek.\n\n\u201cNone of it made sense to me. I don\u2019t think they ended up saving the money they thought they could. I think it was just a case of \u2018If you can\u2019t beat\u2019em, close them down.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter the high school closed, the town bought the building from the county. The sign in the front yard still wishes the Golden Bears good luck.\n\nAccording to Parker, the town learned after the purchase that before any renovations could be done it would cost $50,000 to remove the asbestos.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have that kind of money,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWe can\u2019t even afford to tear it down.\u201d\n\n___\n\nStepping back in time\n\nNext to the old school is the gym. Step inside and it\u2019s a trip back in time to when \u201cThe Hazlewood Tradition\u201d was going strong.\n\nAt one time the gym was the largest in the county. R.A. Hubbard played some basketball games in the gym last season. The school plans to host the county tournament there in January.\n\nWhen the Golden Bears played there it was known for great basketball, but also great pep rallies with kids from the nearby elementary school coming to participate.\n\n\u201cIt was the best pep rallies ever,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe gym would be packed. We had an assistant coach from Alabama visiting one Friday before a game. He came to the pep rally and couldn\u2019t believe what he saw.\n\n\u201cEverything at Hazlewood was the best. We had the best fight song. We had the best victory lines. We even had the best ugly walks at Hazlewood. We had the mojo going.\u201d\n\nGiant pictures of football and basketball state championship teams cover the gym\u2019s walls.\n\n\u201cThe old-timers claim the championship teams argue at night over which team was the best,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe trophy cases are pretty much cleaned out. The Golden Bears won 44 state championships in football, basketball and track and field. The last state champion was the girls basketball team in 2009 coached by Nicholas Vinson. The state championship trophies have been moved to the town\u2019s community center/library. It\u2019s an impressive collection of championship hardware.\n\n___\n\nStuff of legends\n\nThere are many amazing stories surrounding the football program. One involves a playoff game at Gordo in 1982 and the school\u2019s fight song, \u201cOur Boys Will Shine Tonight.\u201d\n\nThe band got lost on the way to Gordo and the football team played like it was lost in the first half. The Golden Bears trailed and both Kerry Goode and quarterback Joseph Langham were injured.\n\nJust as the team stepped outside the locker room to return to the field for the second half, the band arrived and played the fight song. The boys did shine in the second half and won 16-12 on their way to another state championship.\n\n\u201cAnother story the old-timers tell is about Hazlewood trailing late in a game at home with about 90 yards to go for the winning touchdown,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey say the team looked down to the far end of the field and beyond the fence and the railroad track was a golden bear motioning for them to come that way.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s not true, but the way they told it made you want to think it really happened.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLast man standing\n\nJones, 28, holds the distinction of being the last Hazlewood Golden Bear still playing football. After graduating from Hazlewood in 2008, he starred at Arkansas State before being drafted by the Miami Dolphins in 2013. Since then he\u2019s been with the Patriots, Saints, Browns, Texans and 49ers.\n\nHe was released by the 49ers last July because of a knee injury that required surgery. According to Jones, he still receives half his salary from the 49ers while rehabbing his knee. He hopes to sign with a team in the off-season.\n\n\u201cIt was an honor to play football at Hazlewood,\u201d Jones said. \u201cOne of the best parts was getting to play with so many relatives. My family\u2019s blood line runs strong through Hazlewood.\u201d\n\n___\n\nChampions forever\n\nRep. Ken Johnson, R-Moulton, has worked through the Alabama House a way to honor Hazlewood\u2019s athletic success. A resolution naming part of Alabama 20 that runs through Town Creek \u201cChampionship Highway Home of the Hazlewood Golden Bears\u201d has been passed. Signs will soon appear on the highway.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad they are doing something like that,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI would hate for what happened at this school to be forgotten. That would be a shame.\n\n\u201cI never understood why it had to be that way. This county is always looking for any positives it can find. The success of Hazlewood was something positive that people around the state and even the Southeast knew about. Now it\u2019s gone forever.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Decatur Daily, http://www.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/index.shtml", "GRAY, La. (AP) \u2014 Peter Verret III, H.L. Bourgeois High School head volleyball coach, has reached a major coaching milestone.\n\nVerret, who has been the Lady Braves coach for the last 26 years, won his 700th career volleyball match after H.L. Bourgeois\u2019 win over Airline High of Bossier City at the New Iberia tournament on Oct. 20.\n\nVerret\u2019s career coaching record now stands at 701 wins and 298 losses in 26 years. He entered the current high school volleyball season needing 22 wins to reach 700 victories.\n\nVerret said winning his 700th career match was a blessing.\n\n\u201cIt went by fast,\u201d Verret said. \u201cIt snuck up on me. I\u2019ve been very fortunate to be so lucky to have such great athletes to work with. I feel very blessed and thankful. It\u2019s been a great time.\u201d\n\nVerret, a 1980 graduate of H.L. Bourgeois, has experienced a great deal of success since taking over the Lady Braves head volleyball coaching position in 1993. He replaced legendary local volleyball coach Chip Didier, who won two state titles at H.L. Bourgeois in 1987 and 1989.\n\nUnder Verret, the Lady Braves have made it to the state volleyball playoffs every year and won 20 district championships.\n\n\u201cI can honestly say in 26 years we\u2019ve been district champs or district runner-up and made the state playoffs every year, so every one of those teams have played a role in this,\u201d Verret said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a total team effort from everybody. I\u2019m just very lucky and very fortunate. I couldn\u2019t be happier as a coach.\u201d\n\nDidier said Verret, who is a longtime friend and coaching colleague, has built a great legacy at H.L. Bourgeois over the years.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s kept the program going,\u201d Didier said. \u201cHe\u2019s done very well. He has averaged over 20 wins a season. I know it\u2019s something he\u2019s proud of. He\u2019s always in the race for district titles and stuff. He has done an outstanding job. H.L. Bourgeois should be proud of what he has accomplished there.\u201d\n\nDidier said he has always admired how Verret interacted with his players and got the best out of them.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very dedicated to his players,\u201d said Didier, who won over 800 career games as a former local coach on the high school level and at Nicholls State University. \u201cHe cares about them very much. He teaches them everything that he can knowledge-wise and how to play the game. His players really care for him. He compliments the kids very well. A lot of times you can\u2019t say that about all coaches, but his players play really hard for him.\u201d\n\nDespite having a young team this year, Verret has led H.L. Bourgeois back to the Division I state playoffs this season with a 23-14 overall record.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve worked hard. They believed in the system and they made it,\u201d Verret said. \u201cWe were District 6-I runner up.\u201d\n\nVerret, who has taught at H.L. Bourgeois since 1988 and also coaches tennis at the school, took time to thank everyone who has helped him over the years, including his current and former players, family members, administration and co-workers at H.L. Bourgeois, parents and community supporters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been a great ride and just a pleasure to coach at H.L. Bourgeois,\u201d Verret said. \u201cWith so much support and parent backing and community backing, it\u2019s just a wonderful place to be. I have a great coaching staff and my administration is wonderful. I\u2019m just very blessed.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Courier, http://www.houmatoday.com", "TUCKER, Ga. (AP) \u2014 One year after losing his teen daughter to suicide, Richard Blackwell is learning to laugh again.\n\nSixteen-year-old Alex Blackwell died in September 2017, after a yearlong struggle with social anxiety and depression, inflamed by back-to-back sports concussions and extensive leg surgery. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution shared Alex\u2019s story in a Personal Journey earlier this year.\n\nThe rosy-cheeked girl with striking blue eyes was beloved for her wicked sense of humor and spontaneity. Her sudden death, the result of an intentional overdose, left a dent in the Blackwells\u2019 close-knit Tucker community and at Greater Atlanta Christian School, where Alex played soccer.\n\n\u201cShe was the best adventure of my life,\u201d said Seth Masters, Alex\u2019s boyfriend.\n\nIt was two months after Alex\u2019s death before Blackwell and his wife, Kim, spent a day without tears; six months before there were more days without tears than with them.\n\nOn the one-year anniversary of her death last month, neighbors placed luminaries around the Blackwell\u2019s home. The couple spent the stormy night eating sushi and drinking a couple beers before going to bed. Blackwell said they awoke the next morning and felt \u201clike a type of burden had lifted up and off.\n\n\u201cEverybody seemed to think the year was the magic point,\u201d Blackwell said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s true. It\u2019s amazing what a year will do and allow you to recover from.\u201d\n\nRecognizing depression\n\nTo help heal from Alex\u2019s death and to help parents of other teens suffering from depression, Blackwell focused his energy on depression awareness. He began curating and circulating a detailed checklist for parents to identify signs of depression and improve verbal communication with their children.\n\nBut as time passed, he grew concerned by the growing suicide rate. The number of suicides among 15- to 19-year-old girls has doubled between 2007 and 2015, reaching a 40-year high, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBlackwell decided to shift his attention from learning the signs of depression to educating himself on treatments for depression.\n\nHe was fueled, in part, by his own downward spiral.\n\n\u201cI had never suffered from depression and questioned why it was so difficult to overcome,\u201d Blackwell wrote in an email to friends and family four days before the anniversary of Alex\u2019s death. \u201cYet in the weeks following Alex\u2019s death, I felt that if it were not for Kim and (daughter) Grayson I may not have had the will to continue.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Blackwell lost his mother to cancer in April that he recognized he was fighting depression himself.\n\nAny progress Blackwell made since Alex\u2019s death seemed to evaporate.\n\n\u201cI lost all self-confidence in my abilities,\u201d Blackwell said. \u201cI felt that the world was against me, and that every little thing went wrong.\u201d\n\nHe experienced loss of energy and felt powerless to complete menial tasks like sorting the mail, taking a shower or even eating \u2014 all things he experienced after losing Alex.\n\nBlackwell had read so much about depression since his daughter\u2019s death, he knew the symptoms by heart. But like many survivors of loss, he attributed his feelings of sadness and restlessness to grief, not depression.\n\nThe epiphany came one day in May, as Blackwell sat reflecting on the past year.\n\n\u201cI remember thinking, \u2018You know, I wasn\u2019t like this a month ago.\u2019 And I looked at Kim and saw she wasn\u2019t affected the way I was.\u201d\n\nBlackwell set a goal for July 1 to begin turning things around. \u201cI\u2019m getting out of this,\u201d he told himself. \u201cI\u2019m not staying here.\u201d\n\nHe began taking the advice he\u2019d shared with others in blog posts and texts to loved ones suffering their own battles. He adjusted his diet, starting with a vitamin regimen focused on emotional clarity, and made time for exercise after months of neglecting his physical health. And he went back to being a Georgia Soccer referee, a position he\u2019d held for 10 years.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do any of it,\u201d Blackwell said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a participant of life.\u201d But he knew what he needed to do.\n\nBlackwell was lucky. With the help of behavioral therapy, he was able to pull himself out of his depression, but many sufferers lack access to affordable mental health care. Someone with a chemical imbalance due to brain injury or chronic illness \u2014 or someone stuck too deep in their own trauma \u2014 may not have had the ability to get the appropriate professional help.\n\nOne year after losing Alex, Blackwell sees depression \u201cfor the soul-sucking affliction it is. It doesn\u2019t matter where it comes from, it\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nDepressed or not, Blackwell is still mourning, and he works to manage that as best he can.\n\n\u201cWe have a rule,\u201d Blackwell said. \u201cWe only watch comedies in this house.\u201d\n\nA renewed vision\n\nFollowing a string of 14 suicides among Georgia youth within a two-month period last year, the AJC asked GBI Director Vernon Keenan for an explanation.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all over the place.\u201d\n\nSome experts point to social media, online bullying or the overwhelming pressure to succeed both academically and socially for the high suicide rate among teens. Others blame easy access to firearms, which accounted for 43 percent of youth suicides in 2016, according to the CDC.\n\n\u201cBut nobody wants to talk about this stuff. They don\u2019t want to upset the family,\u201d said Keenan. \u201cI don\u2019t think the media wants to talk about it. How do you have a public discussion if no one talks about it?\u201d\n\nBlackwell wants to talk about this stuff. And he has been.\n\nIn fact, he\u2019s met with hundreds of people in schools, hospitals and churches over the last year, he said.\n\n\u201cAlex didn\u2019t die of suicide. She died of depression,\u201d Blackwell told a group of women during a recent talk at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic School in Druid Hills. \u201cThat\u2019s what we have to change. You all have to share with all of your friends your experiences with your children, and share those as often as possible, because we don\u2019t do that now. We don\u2019t talk about these things.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to spread his message, Blackwell asks everyone to pass his name on to anyone that will allow him to come talk to any group of any size \u2014 even if it means driving up to Chattanooga to speak with four people, as he\u2019s done this year.\n\n\u201cTen minutes is all I need,\u201d he said. His goal is to increase awareness about depression, and that goes beyond simply knowing the symptoms. It\u2019s about seeking solutions that help manage the symptoms before they lead to suicide.\n\nTo that end, Blackwell reads everything he can about the front lines of depression research, from the identification of genes that may play a critical role in depression to treatments using electroconvulsion therapy and the club drug ketamine.\n\nBlackwell shares his research on depression, as well as his experience grieving for his daughter, on his public Linked In page at www.linkedin.com/in/richardablackwell. And he continues to talk to anybody who will listen. That includes at a TEDx Cincinnati event next year.\n\n\u201cThe conversations must continue,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, http://www.ajc.com", "COLUMBUS, Miss. (AP) \u2014 Sandy Devlin knows a good teacher when she sees one.\n\nAs graduate coordinator for special education at Mississippi State University, she helps prepare future teachers for the challenges they will face when they lead their own SPED classrooms.\n\nWhen Devlin met Stacee Bonner in fall 2011, her new student\u2019s fire and passion for the special education field indicated she would have little problem meeting those challenges.\n\nIn fact, Bonner\u2019s own challenges to become SPED teacher were arduous enough.\n\nBonner spent seven years at MSU as a custodian, cleaning classrooms and hallways while taking the necessary classes to earn a master\u2019s degree in special education and an educational specialist degree in instructional technology.\n\nNow, she\u2019s a first-year SPED teacher at Columbus Middle School.\n\n\u201cI pushed her because I knew she could do the job and do it very well,\u201d Devlin said. \u201cShe was a great custodian, but I could see she had a passion for kids and we don\u2019t want to waste that. In special education, we need people like her to nurture children.\u201d\n\nBonner graduated from MSU in 2009 with a bachelor\u2019s in educational psychology. She worked as an assistant teacher with West Oktibbeha Elementary School, until budget cuts left her jobless in 2011.\n\n\u201cI had a passion for teaching,\u201d Bonner said. \u201cI wanted to have my own class. I knew that I didn\u2019t want to have any extra student loans. I saw the opportunity and I was willing to take whatever job, full-time, to go to school. I started applying for jobs, even though I was overqualified.\u201d\n\nThe custodial job at MSU allowed her to earn her master\u2019s for free as an employee benefit. But pursuing her passion came with long hours and hard work.\n\nBonner woke up at 3 a.m. to prepare for work at MSU each day, leaving her daughter, Zya, with babysitters while logging her eight-hour shifts. After work, she spent her evenings in class \u2014 either on campus or online \u2014 until she earned the last of her degrees in December 2016.\n\n\u201cIt was stressful and hard,\u201d Bonner said. \u201cIt was a lot of work. It took a lot of self-motivation. But if you have a dream, you have to just go for it. Sometimes you have to remove yourself out of the way and just walk out and do things on faith. I did this by the grace of God.\u201d\n\nWith three degrees, Bonner still worked another year-and-a-half as a custodian waiting for the right teaching job to come along. She finally applied this summer at CMS.\n\nA bright spot in a difficult time\n\nBonner started with CMS Aug. 1.\n\nHer job offer from CMSD came at a strange and difficult time for Bonner. In early July, Bonner\u2019s mother passed away from health complications, but Bonner said getting back into her classroom was a shining moment in an otherwise trying time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really by the grace of God that everything fell in place,\u201d Bonner said. \u201cSince my mom passed, I\u2019ve been holding on, and my (students), they\u2019ve helped get me through it. I just love my babies. ... I\u2019m getting to learn my kids. I\u2019m actually able to get on their level.\u201d\n\nThough just a first-year SPED teacher, Bonner\u2019s knowledge and passion for her work give her the aura of someone far more experienced.\n\nEllicaya Steels\u2019 daughter, Eljanecia, is in Bonner\u2019s classroom each day. Eljanecia, who has cerebral palsy, first struggled transitioning to the middle school. Shortly after classes began, she started enjoying school again and would come home each day with stories about her teacher.\n\nEljanecia has also struggled with reading comprehension, but has seen a steady improvement since the beginning of the school year.\n\n\u201cShe can read it but she can\u2019t comprehend it,\u201d Ellicaya said. \u201cMrs. Bonner has been working with her on it, and she\u2019s doing a lot better. She would skip words, but now she reads 20 minutes a day, and if she thinks she\u2019s wrong she\u2019ll ask questions. She\u2019s had a lot of improvement.\u201d\n\nCMS Principal Billie Smith said the success she\u2019s seen in Bonner\u2019s classroom is rare for a first time SPED teacher.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just determined and hardworking,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAs the position came available, I just felt she would be the perfect applicant. She is a perfect role model for my students. She\u2019s a very valuable asset, not only to Columbus Middle School but to the district.\u201d\n\n\u2018Nothing surprises me about Stacee\u2019\n\nHow well Bonner is doing, and how quickly she has adjusted to leading her own classroom, comes as no surprise to those who helped her along the way.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s exceptional,\u201d Devlin said. \u201cShe fell in love with it. The end result is she\u2019s doing a great job with her children that\u2019s really going to impact their future. That doesn\u2019t surprise me, not one bit. Nothing surprises me about Stacee. I knew she would do it.\u201d\n\nNekela Macon, Lead SPED teacher at Joe Cook Elementary, first met Bonner at West Oktibbeha Elementary School. While working together, Macon said she kept pushing her friend to go back to school.\n\nThroughout the years, Bonner said Macon served as a mentor, helping her while studying at MSU, transitioning into the classroom and even looking over her lesson plans. But Macon said, by this point, Bonner has exceeded any first- year teacher\u2019s expectations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just proud of the accomplishments she\u2019s made,\u201d Macon said. \u201cI hope she continues to prosper throughout her years of teaching. Nothing was going to stop her from achieving what she wanted to achieve.\u201d\n\nBeing where she is now made all the early mornings, late nights and hard work at MSU well worth it, Bonner said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been blessed, and it all happened in God\u2019s time,\u201d she said. \u201cThis first year has been such an enjoyment, and my kids know that I believe in them and push them forward.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Commercial Dispatch, http://www.cdispatch.com", "JACKSON, Miss. (AP) \u2014 Mississippi routinely leads the country in teen traffic fatalities, a fact that law enforcement and family groups are working to battle.\n\nTexting and other distractions can be a part of that, as can speed and drinking. Many cases come from road hazards and other vehicles, too, but one thing increases the risk of death or serious injury in all of those kinds of wrecks: Not wearing a seatbelt.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe in 2018 we still have people who refuse to wear seatbelts and refuse to restrain their children,\u201d said Mississippi Department of Corrections Commissioner Marshall Fisher.\n\nGiven that teenagers sometimes seem to believe they\u2019re bulletproof, reaching them with messages of road safety can be imperative, officials said.\n\nOn Monday, Families First for Mississippi and the Mississippi Highway Patrol announced a new brick in the partnerships being built to keep kids \u2014 and adults \u2014 safe on the roads.\n\nMHP has long driven the length and width of the state with their one rollover simulator, which simulates a vehicle flipping at about 45 miles per hour. When mannequins are put inside, the audience can see how a body without a seatbelt is tossed around a car and is ultimately ejected.\n\nFamilies First has donated another rollover simulator in order to bolster the resources that can be used to reach Mississippi teens with just how serious a rollover wreck can be.\n\n\u201cWe have hundreds, well actually thousands of youth who are stepping up in local high and communities and getting involved with safety,\u201d said Nancy New, adding that when MHP brings the simulator, it gets people\u2019s attention. \u201cThe kids love it and the grownups do as well, because we need to be reminded to wear our seatbelts too.\u201d\n\nMHP Director Col. Chris Gillard said 268 Mississippians who were not wearing their seatbelts lost their lives in crashes on Mississippi roads and highways in 2017. One out of every two people killed on the roads are not buckled up, Gillard said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t recognize a human being when it comes out of the car so fast and so far, it\u2019s like no way possible that\u2019s a human coming out of that car,\u201d said Sgt. Criss Turnipseed. \u201cBut upon closer inspection you see what happens. The videos we show them of the rollovers are probably the most shocking things the kids see. It gets a lot of attitudes where they\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019m not going to wear my seatbelt,\u2019 but a lot of them after seeing this, their opinions change.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our goal is to get people to see what we see first-hand without having to experience it.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, troopers wrote 20,621 seatbelt citations and 3,675 child restraints. Nationally 90 percent of drivers report wearing seatbelts, but in Mississippi it\u2019s only 77.9 percent, Gillard said. That\u2019s among the lowest of all the states in the nation.\n\n\u201cWe are thankful to be part of MS Families First and thankful for their commitment to informing the public of the importance in wearing seatbelts,\u201d Gillard said.\n\nCapt. Johnny Poulos said law enforcement officials are aware that the public gets desensitized to traffic safety campaigns sometimes, but it helps to show them the reality of the situations they could face on the road.\n\n\u201cThis rollover simulator will be vital to spreading the safety message across the state,\u201d said Poulos.\n\nSuch resources as the rollover simulator are important for building bridges between law enforcement and youth as well, Fisher said.\n\n\u201cIt starts at home... It\u2019s important to us in law enforcement that our youth understand we\u2019re your friends, and we want a relationship with our youth,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cTools like this when they\u2019re donated will save lives, and it will get some attention, and that\u2019s important.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Clarion Ledger, http://www.clarionledger.com", "", "", "", "", "Vancouver Canucks' Markus Granlund, back, of Finland, and Ben Hutton celebrate Granlund's goal against the Colorado Avalanche during the third period of an NHL hockey game Friday, Nov. 2, 2018, in Vancouver, British Columbia.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 North Korea has warned it could revive a state policy aimed at strengthening its nuclear arsenal if the United States does not lift economic sanctions against the country.\n\nThe statement released by the Foreign Ministry on Friday evening said North Korea could bring back its \u201cpyongjin\u201d policy of simultaneously advancing its nuclear force and economic development if the United States doesn\u2019t change its stance. The North sopped short of threatening to abandon ongoing nuclear negotiations with Washington.\n\nStill, it accused Washington of derailing commitments made by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump at their June summit in Singapore to work toward a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. It was the first time the North said it could potentially resume weapons tests and other development activities since Kim signaled a new state policy in April.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he plans to talk next week with his North Korean counterpart, apparently referring to senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol. Pompeo did not provide the location and date for the meeting, which will likely be focused on persuading North Korea to take firmer steps toward denuclearization and setting up a second summit between their leaders.\n\n\u201cA lot of work remains, but I\u2019m confident that we will keep the economic pressure in place until such time as Chairman Kim fulfills the commitment he made to President Trump back in June in Singapore,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nThe North Korean Foreign Ministry statement, released under the name of the director of the ministry\u2019s Institute for American Studies, said the \u201cimprovement of relations and sanctions is incompatible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. thinks that its oft-repeated \u2018sanctions and pressure\u2019 leads to \u2018denuclearization.\u2019 We cannot help laughing at such a foolish idea,\u201d it said. The ministry described the lifting of U.S.-led sanctions as corresponding action to the North\u2019s \u201cproactive and good-will measures,\u201d apparently referring to its unilateral suspension of nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests and closure of a nuclear testing ground.\n\nFollowing a series of provocative nuclear and missile tests last year, Kim shifted to diplomacy when he met with Trump between three summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who lobbied hard to revive nuclear diplomacy.\n\nHowever, the North has been playing hardball since the summits, insisting that sanctions should be lifted before any progress in nuclear talks, which fueled doubts about whether Kim would ever deal away a nuclear program he may see as his strongest guarantee of survival.\n\nAhead of his first summit with Moon in April, Kim said the country should shift its focus to economic development as the \u201cpyongjin\u201d policy had achieved a \u201cgreat victory.\u201d He also declared that the North would stop nuclear and long-range missile tests. The North dismantled its nuclear testing ground in May, but didn\u2019t invite experts to observe and verify the event.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. keeps behaving arrogantly without showing any change in its stand, while failing to properly understand our repeated demand, the DPRK may add one thing to the state policy for directing all efforts to the economic construction adopted in April and as a result, the word \u2018pyongjin\u2019 may appear again,\u201d Friday\u2019s statement said, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\n\n\u201cPyongjin\u201d means \u201cdual advancement.\u201d\n\nMoon has described inter-Korean engagement as crucial to resolving the nuclear standoff. A large number of South Korean CEOs accompanied Moon in his September visit to Pyongyang, when he and Kim agreed to normalize operations at a jointly run factory park and resume South Korean visitors\u2019 travel to the North when possible, voicing optimism the international sanctions could end and allow such projects.\n\nBut South Korea\u2019s enthusiasm for engagement with its rival has also created discomfort in the United States amid growing concerns that the North is dragging its feet with its promise to denuclearize. South Korea last month walked back on a proposal to lift some of its unilateral sanctions against North Korea to create diplomatic space following Trump\u2019s blunt retort that Seoul could \u201cdo nothing\u201d without Washington\u2019s approval.", "A relative of a slain Christian grieves during funeral service at Church of Great Martyr Prince Tadros, in Minya, Egypt, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018. Coptic Christians in the Egyptian town of Minya prepared to bury their dead, a day after militants ambushed three buses carrying Christian pilgrims on their way to a remote desert monastery, killing seven and wounding 19. (AP Photo/Amr Nabil)\n\nMINYA, Egypt (AP) \u2014 Hundreds of Egyptian Christians attended a funeral service Saturday after seven people were killed in an ambush by Islamic State militants of buses carrying pilgrims to a remote desert monastery.\n\nThe service at Prince Tadros church in the central city of Minya was held amid tight security. Minya\u2019s top cleric, Anba Makarios, led prayers over a row of six white coffins, all victims from the same family. A separate funeral was held for the seventh victim, a bus driver.\n\nRelatives of the victims cried and held each other for support. Some rested their heads on the coffins and wept. A list of the victims\u2019 names released by the church said a 15-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl were among the dead. Nineteen were wounded in the attack, according to the church.\n\nAida Shehata, who was shot in her legs, said masked men opened fire on three buses from different directions. Two of the buses were able to speed away and reach the monastery, but the militants stopped the third one and killed the driver and six of the passengers, including her husband and his brother.\n\n\u201cThe driver tried to go to the monastery but they (the militants) were faster,\u201d Shehata told a Coptic TV network.\n\nAn Islamic State affiliate based in the restive northern Sinai Peninsula claimed the attack, calling it revenge for the imprisonment of \u201cour chaste sisters,\u201d without elaborating.\n\nThe attack cast a shadow on one of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi\u2019s showpieces \u2014 the World Youth Forum \u2014 which opens Saturday in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. The forum is drawing thousands of local and foreign youth to discuss a wide range of topics, with Egypt\u2019s 63-year-old leader taking center stage.\n\nIn an apparent effort to keep the attack from overshadowing the start of the three-day conference, two state-owned newspapers ran front-page banner headlines about the forum. Akhbar al-Youm ran a large photo of el-Sissi cycling in Sharm el-Sheikh. Its reference to the attack lower down in the page made no mention of casualties.\n\nIS has repeatedly targeted Egypt\u2019s Christians as punishment for their support of el-Sissi, who led the military\u2019s 2013 ouster of an elected but divisive Islamist president.\n\nEl-Sissi, who has made security among his top priorities since taking office in 2014, wrote on his Twitter account that Friday\u2019s attack was designed to harm the \u201cnation\u2019s solid fabric\u201d and pledged to continue fighting terrorism. He later offered his condolences when he spoke by telephone with Pope Tawadros II, spiritual leader of Egypt\u2019s Orthodox Christians and a close ally of the president.\n\nBegemy Nassem Nasr, the priest of the church of St. Mary in the central Egyptian city of Minya, near where the attack took place, suggested it was meant to embarrass el-Sissi as he hosted the youth forum. \u201cI think that this is a terrorist act which is targeting Egypt through playing the card of the Copts,\u201d he said.\n\nFriday\u2019s attack was the second to target pilgrims heading to the St. Samuel the Confessor monastery in as many years, indicating that security measures put in place since then are inadequate. The previous attack in May 2017 left nearly 30 people dead. IS has also targeted Christian churches with a series of suicide bombings since December 2016 that have killed scores of people.\n\nThe attacks led to tighter security around Christian places of worship and Church-linked facilities, where metal detectors and armed police are routinely deployed. They have also underlined the vulnerability of minority Christians in the conservative, Muslim-majority country.\n\nThe Interior Ministry, which oversees the police, said Friday\u2019s attackers used secondary dirt roads to reach the buses carrying the pilgrims, who were near the monastery at the time of the attack. Only pilgrims have been allowed on the main road leading to the monastery since last year\u2019s attack.\n\nSome Christians in Minya said police negligence was partly to blame for the latest attack, saying they stopped providing armed escorts for pilgrims\u2019 buses.\n\n\u201cThey should have escorted them. They know it is dangerous to leave them alone on that road,\u201d said Youssef Attya, a 38-year-old health worker from Minya.\n\nThe Interior Ministry said police were pursuing the attackers, who fled the scene.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Christians, who account for some 10 percent of the country\u2019s 100 million people, have long complained of discrimination. Christian activists say the church\u2019s alliance with el-Sissi has offered the ancient community a measure of protection, but sectarian violence still flares from time to time, especially in poorer and more rural areas.\n\nChristians make up some 35 percent of the population in Minya, more than in any other governorate. The area has also seen the most acts of violence against Christians in recent years.\n\nChristians there accuse the local police of going easy on Muslim assailants, saying authorities prefer to resolve disputes through reconciliation rather than arresting and prosecuting those who commit crimes.\n\n___\n\nHendawi reported from Cairo.", "Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry, left, defends against Minnesota Timberwolves' Tyus Jones (1) during the first half of an NBA basketball game Friday, Nov. 2, 2018, in Oakland, Calif.

Messitte to put the case on hold while they appeal his decision to a higher court in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nThat effort failed.\n\n\u201cThis is another major win for us in this historic case,\u201d said District of Columbia Attorney General Karl A. Racine in a statement. \u201cOur next step is to proceed with discovery. We will soon provide the court a new schedule to begin the process of getting information about how President Trump is profiting from the presidency.\u201d\n\nMessitte wrote in a sometimes blistering 31-page opinion released Friday that the president did not sufficiently meet the requirements for an appeal midway through the ongoing case.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the president, unhappy with the court\u2019s reasoning and conclusion, merely reargues that his interpretation of the emoluments clauses should apply instead of the one the court gave,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe court sees no point in stating again why it concluded as it did.\u201d\n\nBut, Messitte said, merely disagreeing with the court doesn\u2019t constitute a required \u201csubstantial\u201d reason for such an appeal.\n\nJustice Department spokeswoman Kelly Laco told The Associated Press that the department \u201cdisagrees with and is disappointed\u201d by Messitte\u2019s ruling. She added: \u201cThis case, which should have been dismissed, presents important questions that warrant immediate appellate review.\u201d\n\nJustice lawyers had objected to any discovery on a sitting president in his official capacity because of separation of powers concerns, in order to avoid a \u201cconstitutional confrontation\u201d between two branches of government. They argued that the \u201cpublic interest is decidedly in favor of a stay because any discovery would necessarily be a distraction to the President\u2019s performance of his constitutional duties.\u201d\n\nThe president could try to seek a writ of mandamus to have the appeal heard by a higher court. That would be an \u201cextraordinary remedy,\u201d according to the Justice Department\u2019s website, that \u201cshould only be used in exceptional circumstances of peculiar emergency or public importance.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a move with a demanding standard for petitioners that would partly rest on showing Messitte\u2019s decisions to be clearly wrong.\n\nThe plaintiffs, Maryland and the District of Columbia, have said they plan to move forward quickly with discovery, seeking information and financial records that would primarily come from third parties rather than the government.\n\nA clue as to what they may request can be found in the preservation subpoenas they filed more than a year ago with 23 Trump-related entities, including The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, The Trump Organization, the Mar-a-Lago Club, Inc., and entities related to his D.C. hotel and its management, among others.\n\nThe subpoena requires the majority of documents to be preserved from Jan. 1, 2015 on an ongoing basis. The court filings cite document categories for preservation, including those from Nov. 8, 2016 onward concerning \u201cmarketing to foreign or domestic governments, including members of the diplomatic community.\u201d Other noted categories for preservation include documents that would identify guests of the hotel and those who have rented event space, details on all finances, \u201coperating leases, permits, licenses, tax payments or credits to or from foreign or domestic governments.\u201d\n\nA schedule of legal discovery is due in 20 days and it could begin quickly thereafter, depending on what is agreed to by all parties.\n\nThough the case has been narrowed to focus on Trump\u2019s Washington, D.C., hotel, \u201cthat hotel is a nexus for a far-flung web of foreign and domestic emoluments,\u201d said Norman Eisen, chairman of the nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which is co-counsel with the two jurisdictions.\n\nThe emoluments clause has never been fully tested in an American courtroom. Two other lawsuits accusing the president of violating the emoluments clause are also being heard in other federal courts. Neither has reached the discovery stage.\n\nThe plaintiffs have argued that Trump \u2014 who has declined to divest from his assets as president \u2014 is capitalizing on the presidency and causing harm to businesses trying to compete with his Washington hotel, which is just steps from the White House.\n\nThe Justice Department has said earnings from business activities, including hotel room stays, don\u2019t qualify as emoluments. Its attorneys have argued that under Maryland and D.C.\u2019s interpretation, no federal official would even be able to own stock from a foreign company that provides profits or collects royalties.\n\nMessitte pushed back in his opinion against any delaying tactics by the president and his Justice Department lawyers.\n\n\u201cThere is genuine concern on the part of plaintiffs, indeed the court shares it, that if the president is permitted to appeal the court\u2019s decisions in piecemeal fashion, ultimate resolution of the case could be delayed significantly, perhaps for years\u201d especially because it\u2019s likely the president would appeal any negative decisions up to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThat, as a matter of justice, cannot be countenanced.\u201d\n\n__\n\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams", "In this Oct. 23, 2018, photo, Michael Fields Agricultural Institute executive director Perry Brown, left, and Shannah Schmitt, behind, work with a team of employees to inspect their industrial hemp plants for signs of mold, decay and pests, while harvesting the quarter-acre grown for research at the location in East Troy, Wis. (Anthony Wahl/The Janesville Gazette via AP)\n\nJANESVILLE, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Willie Hughes was one of the Wisconsin farmers growing hemp legally for the first time in about seven decades, and he wanted his crop to thrive.\n\nGrowing hemp carried uncertainty. What care did it need? How is it harvested? What\u2019s its legality, considering the federal government still classifies it as an illegal substance?\n\nMany curious farmers chose to stay on the sidelines and not grow hemp this year. They wanted to see how others handled it before jumping in.\n\nHughes put extra pressure on himself.\n\n\u201cA certain part of me wanted to do good because I felt that the success of the industry or the legitimacy of the crop might be judged by my success,\u201d he told the Janesville Gazette . \u201cI wanted to do well for that reason.\u201d\n\nFor corn and soybeans, farmers have a base of knowledge accumulated through generations of growing the crops, but they have no such base to draw from for growing hemp. They knew there would be hiccups and didn\u2019t expect huge yields. This year still was part of the learning phase, Hughes said.\n\nGood thing expectations were low. Results were not impressive.\n\nBy any economic measure, hemp returned with only a whimper.\n\nSignificant summer rains allowed weeds in hemp fields to flourish. A lot of hemp is grown organically, limiting use of chemical weed killers. Some farmers lost their entire hemp crops as weeds engulfed fields.\n\nThe season\u2019s poor outcome might discourage some farmers from planting hemp a second time. It might deter some farmers from giving it a shot at all.\n\nBut others are determined to learn from this year and find a way to make the crop work.\n\nHughes\u2019 15 acres of grain hemp had plenty of weak spots, but some areas were exceptional.\n\n\u201cI got little glimpses of what success looks like, and that was really exciting. Just spots in the field where it clearly, clearly worked,\u201d he said. \u201cThat really cemented my belief that it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nMichael Fields Agricultural Institute in East Troy grew small research plots of hemp grown for grain and hemp grown for cannabidiol, or CBD oil. These are two of the main products derived from hemp, along with fiber.\n\nGrain hemp often is used to make cooking oil or health foods such as hemp hearts. Organic grain hemp seeds fetch about $1 per pound at market.\n\nHemp grown for CBD oil goes toward medicinal supplements and is significantly more lucrative than hemp grown for grain, netting between $20 and $45 per pound depending on its quality, Michael Fields Executive Director Perry Brown said.\n\nThe institute\u2019s research and observations found hemp struggled in wet conditions. Pounding rains that later hardened the soil made it difficult for the plants to out-compete weeds as corn and soybeans can do, he said.\n\nChallenges posed by the growing season were evident in a field of CBD oil plants awaiting harvest. Some were full of branches and stood nearly 7 feet tall. Others were single, 2-foot stalks.\n\nThe big plants might net 5 or 6 pounds of hemp seed pods. The small ones would be lucky to get a half pound, Brown said.\n\nWeather was one issue. A lack of proper equipment was another.\n\nBryan Parr, a Legacy Hemp agronomist whose company is one of a handful of hemp seed providers for Wisconsin farmers, said many farmers used outdated planting equipment that buried seeds too deep.\n\nHarvesting went smoother than expected \u2014 hemp fiber is tough and can easily get tangled inside a combine if harvested improperly. One farmer who did have problems didn\u2019t listen to Legacy\u2019s instructions to clip only the grain head instead of trying to capture the entire stalk.\n\nThat person had to torch a hole in their combine just to remove the fiber, Parr said.\n\nLegacy worked with about 25 farmers across the state. Four of them gave up on their hemp crops because they were overtaken by weeds. The plants were there, but they weren\u2019t worth the effort to harvest, he said.\n\n\u201cI think every farmer has been disappointed so far,\u201d Parr said. \u201cThere have only been two or three farmers that have actually had a decent crop to harvest. Even those guys were somewhat disappointed for the sake of it\u2019s been such a struggle with weather this year.\u201d\n\nFarmers who tried hemp this year wanted to diversify their incomes. Corn and soybean prices have been stuck in a lengthy rut, which generated plenty of hemp interest, according to statistics from the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.\n\nThe state distributed 242 grower licenses and 99 processor licenses, a one-time requirement. Most of them also registered to do business during the inaugural year, and state farmers planted nearly 1,900 acres of hemp, DATCP spokeswoman Donna Gilson said.\n\nLocally, the state issued three grower licenses to farmers in Rock County and nine in Walworth County. There are two farmers with processor licenses in Rock and none in Walworth, she said.\n\nThe state did not differentiate between grain hemp and CBD oil hemp acreage. Those growing for CBD oil faced a scare at planting season when state Attorney General Brad Schimel threatened to disallow its production and distribution, saying sales and distribution could be done only by doctors.\n\nSchimel reversed his position the next week.\n\nLegacy does not grow hemp for CBD oil, but Parr suspects hemp might have legal hurdles to overcome despite Schimel\u2019s reversal.\n\nSome agriculture lenders refused to allow their farmers to grow hemp. The University of Wisconsin-Madison opted not to do research out of fear it could lose federal research money, Parr said.\n\nRight now, hemp production is considered illegal by the federal government despite being allowed in many states. The next federal farm bill includes a provision to regulate hemp production, but the bill\u2019s passage has been delayed several times as Congress battles over food stamps.\n\nHemp will likely never supplant corn or soybeans as Wisconsin\u2019s primary commodity crop. Right now, its advocates are just hopeful it can carve out a niche as a rotational crop.\n\nBut it still has a long way to go.\n\nFederal legalization would be a momentous step forward. Hemp is a cousin to marijuana and was outlawed years ago, even though it contains only trace amounts of psychoactive substances.\n\nWisconsin, once a major hemp producer, must rebuild its processing infrastructure. The state will need more hemp buyers and suppliers if it ever wants to scale up the crop\u2019s acreage.\n\nLegacy is considering locations for a processing plant, but it\u2019s waiting to see if the market expands, Parr said.\n\nOne year ago, he talked to \u201chundreds\u201d of farmers who were interested but wanted to see how things went in 2018. The tough conditions and inability to prove hemp as profitable mean many will still be cautious going forward, he said.\n\nGilson wasn\u2019t sure if interest would wane next year. Brown thinks many farmers will return and that the crop has plenty of potential as long as its market proliferates.\n\nHughes plans on giving it another chance. Hemp fit in nicely with the other specialty crops the family grows on its farm south of Janesville.\n\nDespite the challenging growing season, he called this summer an \u201cimportant lesson learned.\u201d\n\nHughes used a baseball analogy to describe his mindset.\n\n\u201cObviously you want to hit a home run. Who doesn\u2019t want to hit a home run on the first year? But I did curb my expectations a bit because I knew it was going to be a challenge. Am I disappointed? A little bit.\n\n\u201cBut I prepared myself. I wanted to do this not necessarily for financial reasons but for the knowledge. I wanted to learn and become a better farmer. I think I did that, even if on the first year I didn\u2019t hit it out of the park.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Janesville Gazette, http://www.gazetteextra.com", "HUDSON, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Blake Hansen loves beef, but admits he is quite particular about the quality of meat he chooses to consume.\n\nSo, when he sampled a steak he could cut with a spoon, he was hooked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like butter,\u201d he told the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier .\n\nThe beef he sampled is called wagyu, and some say it\u2019s the finest beef in the world. One of four brothers with Hansen\u2019s Dairy Farm in Hudson, Hansen quickly got to work acquiring the rare breed for his farm.\n\nWagyu meat has an extreme marbling, boasts health benefits and a \u201cmelt in your mouth\u201d level of tenderness.\n\n\u2033(The full-bred wagyu) was good, but it was just too rich for me. It\u2019s pretty powerful stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI could only eat maybe 4 to 5 ounces.\u201d\n\nWith more than 150 Holstein dairy cattle outside his front door, Hansen decided to cross-breed his Holstein dairy cattle, which also are known for their fine marbling, with a wagyu.\n\n\u201cIt turned out to be fantastic,\u201d he said.\n\nThe prepared beef is available exclusively at the Table 1912 restaurant in Cedar Falls.\n\nChef Jim Nadeau of the Western Home Communities was one of Hansen\u2019s first customers when the retail stores opened in 2014. At Table 1912, the chefs have a \u201cFarm to Fork\u201d program where they use as much food from area farmers as possible.\n\n\u201cWe need to be unique here in order to draw people in, and it\u2019s a special product,\u201d Nadeau said. \u201cFor us to be the first place in Iowa to be able to use it basically right from farm to fork is phenomenal.\u201d\n\nHansen recently rolled out the Cedar Valley\u2019s first Holstein-Wagyu hamburger at Hansen\u2019s retail stores in Waterloo and Cedar Falls, with the rest of the cuts available for sale privately through Hansen. For those daring enough to try the full-flavored Wagyu, the full-bred beef will be ready near the end of 2019.\n\nCosts for the Wagyu-Holstein beef vary from $100 for a one-pound filet down to $8 for one pound of hamburger. Full-bred Japanese Wagyu beef can cost anywhere from $120 to $200.\n\nPronounced \u201cwag-you,\u201d the larger and meatier breed is derived from Japan. \u201cWa\u201d can be translated as Japanese, and \u201cgyu\u201d means cow, according to the American Wagyu Association.\n\nThe wagyu breed came to the U.S. in the 1980s. Hansen said monitoring the rare breed in the U.S. can be difficult, but some say there are less than 30,000 full-blood wagyu in the United States.\n\nHansen was able to purchase reproductive material from the Tajima strain from Japan, which are fattened longer, taking about 26 to 32 months to create the supreme marbling. Other U.S. beef cattle can take only 18 months to mature for consumption.\n\n\u201cSupposedly this Tajima line is one of the best Wagyu lines in the breed,\u201d Hansen said.\n\nA Holstein also creates a fair amount of marbling and requires a similar low-energy diet. While still boasting the wagyu\u2019s rich flavor, the Wagyu-Holstein crossbreeds produce a more palpable taste.\n\nWagyu has three times the amount of mono-unsaturated fatty acids compared to other beef breeds, meaning it\u2019s higher in unsaturated fat and oleic acid, which is said to be responsible for the rich flavor. Oleic acid also is found in olive and canola oil and, according to reports, can help lower bad LDL cholesterol.\n\nTypically, wagyu breeders will send the high-end quality cuts to the east and west coasts, Hansen said, but he plans to keep all of the meat in Iowa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to keep everything here in the state, let alone the Cedar Valley, just to have people around us enjoy good cuts of meat and not getting rid of it to the coasts.\u201d\n\nHansen said the best way to cook a Wagyu-Holstein steak or burger is rare to medium rare at about 135 degrees.\n\n\u201cYou can definitely taste a difference when you\u2019re eating it in a patty,\u201d said Hansen\u2019s wife, Jordan. \u201cOther seasonings can dull the rich flavor.\u201d\n\nJordan Hansen said she considers the hamburger to be 90 percent lean.\n\n\u201cIf you over cook it, it\u2019s like any other hamburger then, there\u2019s nothing special to it because it gets dry and loses the flavor,\u201d she said.\n\nHansen said he is unsure how popular the beef will be in the Cedar Valley, but he plans to continue breeding and raising the special cattle well into the future.\n\n\u201cBeing that it takes 30 months to get one raised and ready for slaughter, you just don\u2019t want to stop now because if the consumer likes what they eat, then they\u2019re going to have to wait for another 30 months before they get another one,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a continuum of Wagyu-Holstein cattle coming down the pipe from here on out. . I know that I\u2019ll be eating some good quality meat for the rest of my life. If you are a beef eater, you are going to want to try it at least once.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier, http://www.wcfcourier.com", "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 As Republicans tighten their hold on Greater Minnesota and Democrats solidify their base in the state\u2019s urban areas, it\u2019s suburbanites who occupy both the physical and political in-between-land.\n\nIn statewide and Congressional contests, and in the race to control the Minnesota House, the Twin Cities suburbs are a big focal point of both parties\u2019 campaign efforts.\n\nThe Twin Cities suburbs \u2014 Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington counties, not including Minneapolis or St. Paul \u2014 represent a pretty small slice of the state in terms of landmass. So why do they get all the political attention?\n\nThey may not have skyscrapers like Minneapolis and St. Paul, but taken as a whole, the number of voters in the suburbs dwarfs the number of voters in the Twin Cities themselves.\n\n---\n\nThe nonprofit news outlet MinnPost provided this article to The Associated Press through a collaboration with Institute for Nonprofit News.\n\n---\n\nHow much bigger?\n\nIn 2016, there were nearly four times as many votes for president in the Twin Cities suburbs as in Minneapolis and St. Paul. In fact, there were nearly as many votes in the Twin Cities\u2019 suburban counties as there were in all 80 counties outside the Twin Cities metro.\n\nPut together, the Twin Cities\u2019 10 biggest suburbs alone account for 13 percent of the vote statewide. Compare that with about 7 percent of the statewide vote in Minneapolis and 5 percent in St. Paul.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the number of voters in the suburbs that makes them a focus for this year\u2019s elections.\n\nIt\u2019s also their penchant for voting for Republican candidates sometimes, and Democratic-Farmer-Labor candidates others \u2014 often on the same ballot. In a state where the cities are increasingly blue and Greater Minnesota is turning redder, many suburbs are still up for grabs for either party.\n\nLook no further than the 12 districts \u2014 all of them suburban \u2014 that went for Hillary Clinton that also elected Republican state representatives on election night in 2016. Many of them are places that, in 2012, voted for Mitt Romney, but in 2016 switched over to Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nDistrict 49A, represented by Republican Dario Anselmo, exemplifies the phenomenon. Residents of this Edina district preferred Hillary Clinton by a 27 point margin, but sent Anselmo to the statehouse on a margin of 2 points.\n\nThat night, Anselmo took control of the district from Ron Erhardt, a longtime DFL (formerly Republican) incumbent.\n\nIn 2018, Democrats hope their candidate, Heather Edelson, can bring the seat back under DFL control as inner-ring suburbs like Edina turn bluer. As of the last campaign finance deadline, Republicans had barely spent any money in a district Democrats are targeting, a possible sign the GOP has written the seat off.\n\nSeats that went for Clinton but elected Republicans to the House are on the DFL\u2019s list of top legislative targets. Democrats need a net gain of 11 seats to take back control of the Minnesota House.\n\nTwo of Minnesota\u2019s most closely-watched Congressional contests \u2014 the race between Jason Lewis and Angie Craig in CD2, and the race between Erik Paulsen and Dean Phillips in CD3 \u2014 are also largely suburban districts.\n\nNot all suburbs are equally up-for-grabs for either party. In Andover and other further-ring suburbs, Republicans have held onto healthy margins. Brooklyn Park, a diverse suburb northwest of Minneapolis, votes more like the cities.\n\nThis November, it\u2019ll be places like Plymouth \u2014 a mid-sized second-ring suburb west of the cities \u2014 that are bellwethers for which way things are going, both in terms of statewide elections and when it comes to legislative control.\n\nOn the surface, Plymouth looks like many other second-ring Twin Cities suburbs: incomes are higher than places like Brooklyn Park and Hopkins, but lower than places like Lakeville. Plymouth\u2019s population is slightly more diverse than the state\u2019s as a whole.\n\nBut politically, it\u2019s a bit more complicated than some of its neighbors. In 2016, Plymouth re-elected incumbent Rep. Sarah Anderson, a Republican, but also voted for Hillary Clinton.\n\nAnd that in a city with about 44,000 votes for president \u2014 more than Greater Minnesota\u2019s Kittson, Roseau, Lake of the Woods, Beltrami, Cook and Clearwater counties combined.\n\nThat far exceeds the number of votes needed to decide a statewide election, some of which, in recent years, have come down to just a few hundred or a few thousand ballots.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Plymouth that politicos are watching closely as elections near. Places like Maple Grove, Woodbury, Burnsville, Apple Valley and Edina are similarly large reservoirs of potential suburban swing: places where, with the right candidates in the right year, it could be either party\u2019s game.", "Ashley Lange is interviewed by USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin's reporter Mitch Skurzewki Thursday, Sept. 20, 2018, at her house in Wausau, Wis. (T'xer Zhon Kha/The Post-Crescent via AP)/The Post-Crescent via AP)\n\nWAUSAU, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Ashley Lange was drunk \u2014 more than usual. She couldn\u2019t stand. She was slurring her words so badly that her younger sister, Brittany, couldn\u2019t understand her.\n\nHer sister called an ambulance. The two were rooming together in Madison at the time. Brittany was 23; Lange was 29.\n\nAshley Lange was rushed to UW Hospital in Madison, where she had her stomach pumped.\n\nIt was the third time Lange had been brought to the hospital due to her drinking. She isn\u2019t sure what her blood alcohol concentration was that last time, but recalled once that it was over 0.30 \u2014 more than three times the legal limit to drive, and close to the levels of 0.37 to 0.40 that can kill a person.\n\nHer family staged an intervention the next day. Her parents, her sister and her brother Kyle gathered at her apartment and told her \u201csomething needed to change, that it couldn\u2019t keep going on like this,\u201d Lange recalls.\n\nHer parents, who lived 2.5 hours away in Athens, knew Lange had a problem with alcohol, but not the extent to which it consumed her.\n\n\u201cTrying to convince her there was a problem was the issue,\u201d Bob Lange, Ashley Lange\u2019s dad, told the Wausau Daily Herald .\n\nThat was in January 2014. Since the day Lange hit rock bottom almost five years ago, she has not had an alcoholic drink. She sought help, is now the proud mother of a 3-year-old daughter, has a full-time job and was elected this spring to the Marathon County Board, representing the west-side Wausau district where she lives.\n\nLange has shared her story exclusively with USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin to help others who are facing addiction.\n\n\u201cYou have to tell someone, because you can\u2019t (face addiction) alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be there for those that need it. I couldn\u2019t have done it by myself.\u201d\n\nLange started drinking while she was a student at Athens High School. She went to the University of Wisconsin-Madison and studied environmental science; she graduated in 2006. At first she was like other students, going to parties on weekends. But it wasn\u2019t long until she was staying up to drink until the sun came up, long after everyone else had returned to their dorms or apartments.\n\nShe then started drinking every day at a bar near her apartment or in her apartment.\n\n\u201cShe had a problem with drinking starting her senior year in high school,\u201d Bob Lange said. \u201cMoving to Madison, she had a lot of good friends, but when you\u2019re that age, partying is important. We wanted to be there for her constantly. ... But you can\u2019t know everything.\u201d\n\nAshley Lange said she was very good at hiding her alcoholism. When her parents questioned her about her drinking when she returned to Athens for the holidays, she brushed it off as something college students did, she said.\n\nShe was able to work as a quality coordinator for Covance, a microbiology lab in Madison, without her co-workers realizing there was a problem.\n\n\u201cI was a high-functioning drunk,\u201d she said. \u201cI could drink all day and go to work the next day. I don\u2019t think my parents \u2014 I don\u2019t think anyone, really, knew how bad it was.\u201d\n\nLange knew she had a drinking problem, but was in a state of denial about just how bad it was.\n\n\u201cIt started with parties and bars, but once I started drinking, I couldn\u2019t stop,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the end ... I was drinking, alone in my house, without any social aspect to it. Just to drink.\u201d\n\nAfter the January 2014 intervention with her family, Lange sought help. She went for individual and small group counseling at an outpatient recovery center in Madison. She went to individual counseling once every two weeks with a therapist and took advantage of all the group meeting possibilities.\n\nShe said those meetings still hold her accountable to this day, and what she learned in counseling still sticks with her.\n\n\u201cSome of the stories you hear there and knowing that small group, they are rooting for me, they keep me strong,\u201d Lange said.\n\nIn 2014, her daughter Jane was born and it had an emotional impact on Lange, who said she has to succeed for her daughter. Jane is a cute, curly-haired bundle of joy that is almost always attached to Lange\u2019s hip when she isn\u2019t working.\n\nLange has now been sober for nearly five years. While her daughter is key to her sobriety, she also said you have to want to change for yourself.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t work otherwise,\u201d Lange said. \u201cI feel that is the only way you ever get and stay sober. You have to want to do it. I think I got sober for myself, I stay sober for my daughter.\u201d\n\nAshley said she still is tempted to drink every once in a while, usually when she\u2019s really stressed. But, she looks at the black curly hair of her sleeping daughter or sees her playing and laughing, and she knows she can\u2019t even put her hands on a bottle.\n\n\u201cThrough (therapy) I rediscovered the things that made me feel good, that made me replace that feeling I thought alcohol was giving me,\u201d Lange said. \u201cChasing that high. Finding those things \u2014 volunteering and hiking. Hearing others\u2019 stories in a group and in individual sessions reminding myself to love me and what I loved doing. You lose that when you\u2019re drinking.\u201d\n\nAlthough her interest in government made it hard to leave Madison, Lange knew she needed to come closer to home and in spring 2015 she and Jane moved in with her parents in Athens.\n\n\u201cI loved Madison,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to get a fresh start to get away from a bad routine in Madison and knew that I wanted Jane to be around and close to her grandparents.\u201d\n\nThe two lived in Athens for nearly two years, but now have their own apartment on Wausau\u2019s west side. Lange works for UAS Labs as a quality assurance supervisor in Wausau. She has worked at UAS Labs for three years.\n\n\u201cJane has brought out a sense of responsibility in Ashley,\u201d Bob Lange said. \u201cShe is owning her past addiction and owning being a mom.\u201d\n\nReturning home also sparked an interest to making a difference in the community and doing something \u201cwhere Jane can see and be proud of me,\u201d Ashley Lange said.\n\nEarlier this year, Lange decided to seek a seat on the Marathon County Board representing the 9th District. That decision took Lange and Jane to many doors to hear from voters. She would work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and then head out daily with Jane, bundled up in a pink coat and pink hat, riding in her lime green wagon with toys surrounding her.\n\nLange shared her campaign philosophy in a recent Facebook post: \u201cIt\u2019s boots on the ground. It\u2019s kids in wagons. It\u2019s talking to your neighbors, even the ones who don\u2019t support you. Especially them. . It\u2019s not about big money from big donors and special interests. It\u2019s not about spending unlimited funds on ads. It\u2019s about people. They remember who made them feel like they matter.\u201d\n\nShe also shared her story of addiction and recovery with some of those she spoke with while campaigning.\n\nLange was elected to the 9th District seat in April and said it was important for her because people in positions of power can influence change for those in need.\n\n\u201cShe ran a really great campaign and you could see it wasn\u2019t just for show. Ashley wanted to win,\u201d said her friend and fellow Marathon County Board member Katie Rosenberg. \u201cAshley and Jane were out knocking on doors and talking to people. To have her story and want to make a difference for the community ... it\u2019s really inspiring to see up close.\u201d\n\nHer firsthand experience has made Lange want to help others battling addiction. She is an avid supporter of medical marijuana. Lange sees the drug as a legitimate treatment for some people and says it doesn\u2019t belong in the same category as heroin and other drugs.\n\nIn the next 18 months (her two-year term will end in the spring of 2020), Lange hopes to propose and support initiatives at a county level for addiction and recovery help with better access to mental health and recovery resources.\n\n\u201cThere is a stigma around any addiction,\u201d Lange said. \u201cBut we have to help (addicts) whether it\u2019s with resources or just listening. A lot of people are afraid to tell their story and I am here to support, listen and hopefully help create changes for those in need and help them know they aren\u2019t alone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible how many people have reached out to me since I opened up about my sobriety to tell me their own stories and ask for help. It\u2019s a really humbling position to be in.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Wausau Daily Herald Media, http://www.wausaudailyherald.com", "In this Thursday, Oct. 18, 2018 photo, Stephanie Cone, with her children Calen, 11, and Cadie, 8, talk about the short time they spent with their sister Clara after she was born, at their home in Sartell, Minn. (Jason Wachter/St. Cloud Times via AP)\n\nST. CLOUD, Minn. (AP) \u2014 For parents who have experienced infant or pregnancy loss, there never seems to be enough time. Each moment passes too quickly as parents wade through confusion, trauma, grief and disbelief.\n\nStephanie Cone of Sartell hopes she\u2019s helped make that transition just a little easier. She\u2019s the mother to three children, Calen, 11, Cadie, 8, and Clara.\n\nIn 2015, Cone lost Clara after only 64 minutes to a congenital heart defect. This year, she lent her family\u2019s story to support a grant application to purchase \u201cCuddleCots.\u201d\n\nShe wrote a letter, describing her experiences, some of which is included in this story.\n\nIt worked.\n\nSt. Cloud Hospital and CentraCare Health-Monticello each received a donation from Hope Remains, an organization which support families affected by miscarriage, stillbirth and infant loss.\n\nThe CuddleCot is essentially a cooling system which can be used in a crib. It helps preserve a baby\u2019s features, delaying the natural processes that occur after death. Water runs through a blanket, keeping the baby cool.\n\nIt allows families time to bond with their child before they are taken away, said Melissa Lahn, director of the Family Birthing Center at St. Cloud Hospital. It also allows time for the ever-important keepsake making: prints and molds of hands and feet and photos.\n\nIn previous decades, a child\u2019s remains were often whisked away as soon as they died.\n\n\u201cNow, we encourage (parents) to hold, touch and take pictures,\u201d Lahn told the St. Cloud Times . \u201cI think it helps promote healing and closure, and realizing that really was a life.\u201d\n\nIt means the wider family can get involved too, allowing more time for parents, friends, siblings and children to get to the hospital, Lahn said.\n\nThe goal is to have a CuddleCot in every CentraCare facility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s touching knowing that it will get used, but in the same regard, it\u2019s also very sad, that somebody else is going through those emotions,\u201d Cone said.\n\nClara\u2019s legacy is living on in the CuddleCots, but also in Cone\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cThrough Clara I\u2019ve been connected with several other infant loss moms,\u201d Cone said. \u201cI think as far as advice, all I can say is, you\u2019ll get through it. It\u2019s the worst imaginable thing ever, but you\u2019ll get through it. They\u2019re your baby, regardless.\u201d\n\nAt a routine 20-week ultrasound, doctors discovered Cone\u2019s daughter\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t developing correctly. What followed was a whirlwind of tests, appointments, consultations and planning, amid heavy emotions.\n\n\u201cAt one point we were told by a pediatric cardiologist that our baby ... had a \u201950-50 chance to survive to 30 weeks in utero,\u2019\u201d Cone said.\n\nAbout three months after first noticing a problem, Cone received a call from a pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon in Minneapolis.\n\n\u201cIn his opinion, Clara\u2019s heart was beyond repair. There were too many problems to overcome, and a surgery was not a viable option,\u201d Cone said.\n\nThe plans changed from life-saving surgeries to comfort measures.\n\n\u201cSince learning of Clara\u2019s heart condition ... I prayed and prayed for a miracle for her,\u201d Cone said. But her prayers changed. Now she was praying for her daughter to at least be born alive.\n\n\u201cThat I would get to meet her and see her alive and hear her cry. I prayed that when she went to heaven she would be in my arms,\u201d Cone said.\n\nThat\u2019s just what happened.\n\nOn July 20, 2015 at 7:17 a.m., Clara Grace Cone was born alive.\n\nShe was crying and whimpering like other newborns, Cone said, with soft pink skin, a perfect round head, dainty features and a full head of dark hair.\n\n\u201cFrom the outside one would never know her heart was broken,\u201d Cone said.\n\nWhen her older brother and sister visited, Clara opened her eyes wide \u2014 the only time she opened her eyes, Cone said.\n\n\u201cShe just looked at us and she smiled,\u201d Caden said.\n\nClara was baptized and family members visited.\n\nHer hair was washed, and she was dressed in a gown made out of Cone\u2019s wedding shawl.\n\n\u201cI held Clara close, skin to skin, taking in every little whimper and breath and warm touch,\u201d Cone said. \u201cHer breathing started to slow, and looking at her in that moment my heart knew she went to be with our Lord at 8:21 a.m.\u201d\n\nShe had lived for just 64 minutes.\n\nBut more than four years later, her presence is still felt in Cone\u2019s home. Her photos are on the wall. The family talks about her. She\u2019s not forgotten.\n\n\u201cMy friends and co-workers, people still talk about her. On her birthday, we still celebrate her,\u201d Cone said. \u201cShe\u2019s got her name in a room upstairs just like the other kids. There are pictures everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe only difference is that Clara\u2019s photos stay static, ever a newborn, while Calen and Cadie grow and change.\n\nCone said that throughout the 64 minutes of Clara\u2019s life, the thought of \u201cmore time\u201d kept going through her head.\n\n\u201cWhen I was holding Clara and her breathing was slowing, I said to myself, \u2018No, not yet, not yet. It\u2019s not enough time,\u2019\u201d Cone said.\n\nThe Cone family didn\u2019t have a CuddleCot, so as soon as Clara passed, she began to change.\n\n\u201cNo one can really explain to you the changes that are going to occur,\u201d Cone said.\n\nWithin minutes, the pink color faded from her face. Within hours, her body became cold to the touch and her lips and body turned purple and blue.\n\n\u201cBy late evening, my husband had said she was changing and we would want to remember her as beautiful as she was. He told me we would soon need to let her go,\u201d Cone said.\n\nCone\u2019s cesarean section prevented her from accompanying Clara on her journey.\n\n\u201cGiving Clara that last hug,\u201d Cone said, \u201cand holding her for that final moment before handing her to my husband ... was one of the most difficult moments in my entire life.\u201d\n\nOne thing Cone hopes every family hears and holds on to is this: \u201cYour baby is still loved and they\u2019re still remembered.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: St. Cloud Times, http://www.sctimes.com", "In this Oct. 18, 2018, photo, dentist Kou Vang works on a patient in his St. Paul, Minn. office.

His sister had come back from her appointment missing teeth and he was sure the same thing was about to happen to him.\n\nDr. Kou Vang entered the examination room of his Frogtown office, switched smoothly from English to Hmong, and spoke to Evan in a calm, reassuring voice. It\u2019s a method he has perfected over the past 20 years, practiced especially for patients from Laos who are skeptical of dentistry because their culture teaches that toothaches are caused by unhappy ancestors.\n\nVang, 63, didn\u2019t get around to dentistry until he was in his 40s. He was told he was the first Hmong to go into dentistry in Minnesota, and probably the first grandfather to graduate from his program.\n\nThat\u2019s because Vang\u2019s life took him the long way, through war, prison camp, destitution, immigration and a lot of hard work.\n\nLast month, Vang retired from the Minnesota Air National Guard as a lieutenant colonel during a ceremony attended by several local dignitaries. He is asked to share his story wherever he goes and recently shared it with the Pioneer Press .\n\nVang was born in 1955 in the jungles of eastern Laos, the third oldest of 15 children. A civil war was gaining traction between the Laotian government and communist forces backed by North Vietnam.\n\nBy the time Vang was in elementary school, he hadn\u2019t lived in one place longer than a few years because of the fighting.\n\n\u201cYou attend school for maybe two or three years and then you move,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were always on the move.\u201d\n\nAlthough the United States was never officially at war with Laos, the CIA was there, training, equipping and supporting local hill tribes to fight the communists. One of those Hmong was Vang\u2019s father, who became a bodyguard for the famous Gen. Vang Pao.\n\nThe CIA recruited Vang, then 14, and others who could speak broken English to be their eyes and ears on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, a military supply route run by the Communist Party.\n\n\u201cWe had to report back to them and say the Viet Cong is coming, so they can relay it to the airplanes,\u201d he said.\n\nBetween 1964 and 1973, the U.S. dropped 2 million tons of bombs on Laos in an attempt to stop communism, making it the most heavily bombed country in history relative to the size of its population.\n\nHow did Vang handle such a perilous job, being so young? He said in war time, it\u2019s normal.\n\n\u201cYou did not have a choice. You either do, or die,\u201d he said.\n\nVang did this for about four years until one day he and his friends were captured by a North Vietnamese patrol and kept as prisoners for a month. They were locked in huts and taken out only to be questioned and beaten. They survived by eating bugs and drinking water that reeked of urine, Vang said.\n\nOne night, a powerful storm knocked out the camp\u2019s generators, plunging the jungle into darkness and giving Vang and his friends a chance to escape. Tracked by dogs, the boys ran frantically through the thick vegetation. Along the way, they got separated. Three of them never returned.\n\nThese are the memories that haunt Vang\u2019s dreams, still bring the goosebumps and make the tears fall down his face, he said.\n\nBack at the CIA military post, Vang refused to go back out on the trail. He was reassigned as an air traffic controller at Long Cheng, the busiest airport in Laos during the Vietnam War.\n\nAt age 17, he married Song Ly and had a daughter, Pagnia. By this time, things were going poorly for the U.S. in Vietnam, and in 1975, the CIA decided to pull out.\n\nOnce the North Vietnamese army heard the news, they descended in force on the base.\n\n\u201cThey were shooting at the airport,\u201d Vang said. \u201cThey were moving in and everybody was running to get on the planes.\u201d\n\nSong Ly and Pagnia made it onto a departing C-130, but Vang was left behind.\n\n\u201cI thought I would probably never see my family again,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife and my daughter thought I was dead.\u201d\n\nVang would have to figure out by himself how to evade the army, get across the Mekong River and locate his family in Thailand.\n\nIt is estimated that about a third of the Hmong population in Laos fled to Thailand. About 130,000 made their way to United States.\n\nIn the meantime, Vang\u2019s wife and 1-year-old daughter were settled in a refugee camp. Every day, Song Ly would get up, dress herself and her daughter and go to the area where the buses brought new refugees. There she would wait, wondering if she would ever see her husband again.\n\nIt took about a month for Vang to escape, slipping through the communists by pretending to be a student and hiding his military ID in his sock. He stepped off the bus in the refugee camp and into his wife\u2019s arms.\n\n\u201cShe was so happy. I was so happy. We were holding each other and crying,\u201d he said. They recently celebrated their 46th anniversary.\n\nThe refugee camp did what it could, but there were so many fleeing the conflict that resources were scarce and the Vangs often went hungry. They lived inside the fenced camp for a year, had a baby boy named Pete and left in 1976 when they were sponsored by Zion Lutheran Church in Belvidere, Illinois.\n\nThough the Hmong played a crucial role in the CIA\u2019s \u201cSecret War,\u201d the majority were at first deemed \u201ctoo primitive\u201d to be given asylum in the United States, according to the Minnesota History Center. Only Gen. Vang Pao, his closest associates and others employed directly by the U.S. government were allowed into the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe were very fortunate that the United States just took us into their arms,\u201d Vang said.\n\nAdjusting to a foreign culture is never easy. For the Vangs, who didn\u2019t hear from other family members for about two years, emotions ranged from terrible homesickness to humorous incidents like the first time they saw snow and thought it was ashes from a fire, something they were used to seeing in Laos.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the time Song Ly mistook a bucket of vanilla ice cream for lard.\n\n\u201cMy wife was cooking the veggies. She scooped the ice cream into the pans. There was no grease! The veggies tasted sweet. We just did not know why,\u201d he said, laughing.\n\nVang\u2019s first job in the U.S. was working for $2.30 an hour as a janitor. Eventually, he had three jobs to make ends meet as his family increased by four children: two girls, Pachee and Pahoua, and two boys, John and David.\n\nOver the next 10 years, his family members joined him in the U.S., many of them congregating in the Twin Cities.\n\nThanks to a group of Hmong immigrants who formed a foundation and rallied for the rescue of those left behind, Minnesota, and especially the Twin Cities, supported the second-largest Hmong population in the U.S., according to the Minnesota History Center. Of the state\u2019s total Hmong population, 97 percent (64,422) resided in the Twin Cities area \u2014 the densest concentration anywhere in the nation.\n\nIn 1986, the Vangs packed up and moved to St. Paul to join them.\n\n\u201cMinnesota made us feel so welcome,\u201d Vang said.\n\nBy this time, Vang had been a janitor, an assembly line worker, an upholsterer, a real estate agent and an insurance agent. He would work from early morning until midnight and on the weekends. He decided he did not want to do this for another 10 years, so he got his GED at age 31 and enrolled at Lakewood Community College (now Century College) to become a dentist.\n\n\u201cI studied no less than 15 hours a day for 10 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI rode bus No. 16 every day to college.\u201d\n\nLearning medical terms in English was hard, and many of them were in Latin, he said.\n\n\u201cI would bring a tape recorder to class and then translate it. I\u2019d read a chapter 10 times,\u201d he said.\n\nOnce Vang graduated, he was approached by two men in uniform, which, considering his background, made him very nervous.\n\nThe men were from the Minnesota Air National Guard and were hoping to recruit Vang to be a dentist at the base. He felt he owed the U.S. for getting him out of Laos, so in 1998, he signed up. It didn\u2019t hurt that they offered to help him pay his student loans. What they failed to tell him, however, was that he\u2019d have to go through basic training. That meant push-ups, drills and long hikes, something not so easy for a man over 40.\n\n\u201cWhen I came back, I told the recruiter, \u2018I\u2019m mad at you guys,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIf I knew this, I would never, ever have signed up.\u201d\n\nVang said he sometimes misses his old country and thinks about the jungles and the food he was once used to. But as long as Laos is a communist country, he can never return, he said. He\u2019s considered an enemy of the people because he collaborated with the CIA. His association with Gen. Pao makes him a wanted man.\n\nEvery time life got tough, Vang said, he persevered because he knew it could be worse.\n\n\u201cI tell myself, I went through something tougher than this. This is not life and death. If I can go through the war in Laos, I can do this,\u201d he said.\n\nAlong with Guard duty, Vang opened his first dentist office in 1998. He has expanded from four chairs and himself to eight chairs and 11 employees. He also bought an old car dealership and remodeled it into the Hmong Minnesota Professionals building that includes other businesses, such as a bank and a chiropractic office.\n\nWhat he loves most about America, Vang said, is opportunity.\n\n\u201cIf you really want to do something in this country, you can. It\u2019s up to you,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people say, \u2018I cannot do this or I cannot do that.\u2019 That\u2019s baloney. The U.S. gave me so much. I came here with nothing and now I am a doctor.\u201d\n\nCol. David Nelson, commander of the Medical Group at the 133rd Airlift Wing in St. Paul, summed up Vang\u2019s life at his Guard retirement ceremony Oct. 13 with words that made him grin from ear to ear.\n\n\u201cLt. Col. Vang, you are a true American,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have lived a life of honor.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: St. Paul Pioneer Press, http://www.twincities.com", "Iowa silo to be turned into mural\n\nFORT DODGE, Iowa (AP) \u2014 There are big canvases to paint on, and then are BIG canvases.\n\nArtist Guido van Helten, of Brisbane, Australia, is working on the biggest one available in Fort Dodge \u2014 an 80-foot-tall abandoned concrete silo along Hawkeye Avenue.\n\nHe\u2019s recently started putting brush to concrete after meticulously planning the work.\n\n\u201cI trust my planning,\u201d he told The Messenger .\n\nThe mural will, in its finished form, be viewable from all four sides of the structure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a 360-degree mural,\u201d van Helten said.\n\nVan Helten\u2019s work was chosen by the Public Art Committee, which was formed in 2016 to oversee the silo project. Members include city planning staff, the Fort Dodge Fine Arts Association, the Image Committee of the Greater Fort Dodge Growth Alliance, and staff from the Blanden Memorial Art Museum.\n\nHe\u2019s painted murals on large buildings all over the U.S., Asia, Europe and Australia.\n\nWhen planning a work, he considers the existing concrete surface, both its color and shape, to be an organic part of the work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool to use the concrete as a base,\u201d he said. \u201cI use all the angles. Some are curved, some are flat.\u201d\n\nThe paint is specially formulated for concrete.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mineral-based paint,\u201d he said. \u201cIt bonds and becomes part of the wall.\u201d\n\nIt actually repels moisture, something that will be important in the future on the north-facing side of the silo.\n\n\u201cThere was a mold back here,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, with this paint, it protects the concrete as well.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t want to get too aggressive in removing that mold, he said, because he wanted to preserve the concrete\u2019s naturally aged patina.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to change it; I want to add to it,\u201d he said.\n\nRight now he\u2019s working on the sides that receive the least sunlight.\n\n\u201cWhen the weather turns I\u2019ll be in the sun,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s already had one turn with the Iowa weather.\n\n\u201cI was painting in the snow the other day,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe paint dries. It\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nMuch of his workday is spent in a lift bucket high above the ground. He likes it when people come by and watch, but he isn\u2019t able to spend much time on the ground with them.\n\nAnd don\u2019t ask him how many gallons of paint he\u2019s going to use either.

No public tax money is being used.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Messenger, http://www.messengernews.net", "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s like a giant puzzle.\n\nAn approximately 4,000-piece limestone puzzle that involves cranes, labeling, assistance from an engineer in Indiana and careful planning to fit everything together.\n\nWhen it\u2019s done, the final product will be a new addition to the century-old Central High School in downtown Omaha.\n\nSchool expansions are not uncommon. But most don\u2019t happen because alumni see a need and then raise $19.3 million to make it a reality.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t happen in public high schools. It just doesn\u2019t. But it does here in Omaha, thanks to our philanthropic community,\u201d said Central High School Principal Ed Bennett.\n\nThe Central High School Foundation wanted to provide new and updated spaces for the fine arts, but no one wanted the addition to block the view of the school or add a wing that would clash with the building\u2019s neoclassical style, the Omaha World-Herald reported.\n\nThat\u2019s where the limestone comes in.\n\nThe limestone being used for the project comes from the same area in Bloomington, Indiana, where the limestone for the original building was extracted, said Faron Riley, project manager for Sampson Construction.\n\nThe stone is cut in Indiana and then brought to Omaha, where it\u2019s milled.\n\nEvery piece of limestone is cut, fabricated and installed. Sampson Construction works with an engineer in Indiana to figure out the size, depth and cubic footage of each piece and how to anchor it to the building.\n\nSome of the limestone pieces weigh a couple of hundred pounds and can be set by hand. Other pieces weigh 800 to 900 pounds and have to be moved by crane.\n\n\u201cIt cost more. And it took a little longer. But we think it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Mike Lebens, class of 1970, said of the limestone. Lebens is the co-chair of the project\u2019s fundraising campaign.\n\nThe school\u2019s current library, vocal music and drama spaces have not been significantly updated since the 1930s.\n\nThe alumni knew that the fine arts spaces were outdated, small and not equivalent to those in other high schools. Lebens said they wanted to change that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the alumni and donors love Central. That\u2019s why they made the donations,\u201d Lebens said. \u201cBut I think, without exception, we\u2019re all big supporters of public education. I think that\u2019s critically important for Omaha and the country.\u201d\n\nThe original school\u2019s limestone exterior was carefully cleaned and restored. The hope is that it will be difficult to tell where the original building starts and the addition begins.\n\nThe addition will provide new classrooms for instrumental and vocal music and a black box theater \u2014 a sparse, boxlike performing space that allows for flexible sets \u2014 that also will serve as a storm shelter.\n\nA new library also is being built. In addition to having books and computers, it also will have windows and a skylight that will let in natural light and offer a view of downtown Omaha.\n\nThe project also includes a plaza and a green roof.\n\nThe addition frees up 25,000 square feet of space inside the existing school.\n\nThat space will be repurposed for programs for special education students and English language learners. Bennett, the principal, said facilities for those students are inadequate because of the building\u2019s size and age.\n\nThe Omaha Public Schools kicked in $5.5 million for the renovation inside the existing building and to provide furniture and fixtures for the addition. The money came out of the district\u2019s site and building fund.\n\nConstruction work on the addition is expected to be completed in February. The goal is to have students in the new classrooms after spring break.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Omaha World-Herald, http://www.omaha.com", "LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) \u2014 China\u2019s decision to require cleaner recyclables has put some U.S. recyclers out of business or forced them to limit the kind of materials they will take.\n\nBut in Lincoln the China decision has had a more limited impact, so far.\n\nRecycling processing companies \u2014 which buy from local haulers, sort and resell material \u2014 have raised their rates, but they are still taking all the traditional recycling products, except for glass and plastic bags.\n\nIn January, China, the world\u2019s leading recyclables buyer, closed its doors to waste paper, metals or plastic unless they\u2019re 99.5 percent pure.\n\nThat\u2019s an unattainable standard at most U.S. single-stream recycling processing plants.\n\n\u2033(China\u2019s decision) affected everyone, but it probably has had a different impact here than on the coasts, largely because we haven\u2019t had the same luxury of sending everything off to China,\u201d said Dale Gubbels, CEO of First Star Fiber, a Nebraska processor.\n\nBoth First Star Fiber and Mid America Recycling have raised their rates to haulers, who handle Lincoln\u2019s curbside recycling, the Lincoln Journal Star reported.\n\nIn some cases the rates are higher than the city landfill fees.\n\nIn Lincoln, recycling companies relied more heavily on domestic companies to purchase their recyclables and have built up relationships with domestic mills, Gubbels said.\n\nSo local processors still have a market for recyclables. But, because of supply and demand, the prices for recyclable products have dropped.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have much choice. We have to cover our costs,\u201d Gubbels said, about recycling processors raising their rates.\n\nThe city has been less affected because the recyclable material from the public sites is already sorted, giving it a higher value, said Donna Garden, assistant director at Public Works and Utilities.\n\n\u201cThe materials we take to the processors are clean and separated,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the city has seen a drop this year in the price it is reimbursed for recyclable material. The combined value for total recyclables has dropped from about $40 a ton at the beginning of the year to about $28 a ton, according to Garden.\n\nBecause of the increase in recyclables being taken to city centers, the city\u2019s revenue of about $16,000 a month has not changed.\n\nThe city has also seen an increase in costs, from an average of $37,000 per month to $55,000 per month, for hauling recyclables from the city sites because of the dramatic increase in cardboard recycling since the city banned corrugated cardboard at the landfill April 1.\n\nThe city pays hauler Von Busch for pulling each container from a recycling center, under a three-year contract. The cost per pull hasn\u2019t changed but the amount of material dropped off at city sites has increased, Garden said.\n\nBut recycling is not just about the money, according to Garden. Recycling is important because it diverts material from the landfill, saves natural resources, provides jobs and \u201cis a good thing for the environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to keep that in mind,\u201d she said.\n\nLocal haulers are concerned as they see some processors in surrounding states refusing to take some plastic and other material and raising rates.\n\n\u201cGlass is gone. Plastic\u2019s on the way out,\u201d said Ryan Hatten, with Paragon Sanitation and president of Lincoln Solid Waste and Recycling Association.\n\nWhat happens in surrounding states usually finds its way to Nebraska, he said.\n\nBut Gubbels and Kelley McReynolds, with Mid America Recycling, are optimistic that U.S. companies will find more ways to use recyclable material, increasing demand.\n\nFirst Star Fiber is working on a program where consumers will be able to buy a bright orange Hefty Energy bag that they will fill with non-recyclable plastic, like bags, bread wrappers, straws and items that degrade the value of recyclable material.\n\nThe plastic will be sent on to be used as a fuel or to a company that can use it for making fence posts, railroad ties, landscaping timbers and parking lot bumpers, Gubbels said.\n\nGubbels said he is also seeing some investments in the domestic market, a hopeful sign that there will be some new markets to replace China.\n\nBut McReynolds said he expects the fees to remain high and pressure to keep contaminants out of the recycling stream will continue.\n\nRecycling companies moved to single stream (where consumers do not have to separate the plastic from the paper and the cardboard) because they wanted to increase the level of recycling by making it more convenient, Gubbels said.\n\nRecyclers, like him, didn\u2019t take into account the cost of putting in the sorting system or that commodity prices would drop, he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Lincoln Journal Star, http://www.journalstar.com", "Central American migrants, part of the caravan hoping to reach the U.S. border, a ride on in the trunk of a taxi, in Acayucan, Veracruz state, Mexico, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018. (AP Photo / Marco Ugarte)\n\nISLA, Mexico (AP) \u2014 Hundreds of Central American migrants from a 4,000-strong caravan winding its way through southern Mexico and toward the U.S. border splintered off on their own Saturday after broken promises of bus transportation.\n\nPatience appeared to be wearing thin among the exhausted trekkers after Veracruz Gov. Miguel Angel Yunes reneged on an offer Friday to provide buses to leapfrog the migrants to the Mexican capital. Tempers flared as the migrants struggled with exhaustion, blisters, sickness and swollen feet.\n\nCaravan organizers have pleaded for buses in recent days after three weeks on the road, hitching rides and walking. The group scattered between several towns in Veracruz Saturday, raising questions of whether they would stick together.\n\nSeveral thousand planned to spend the night in Isla, about 700 miles (1,126 kilometers) south of the U.S. border, while another large contingent hunkered down in Juan Rodriguez Clara and yet another reached Tierra Blanca, 80 miles (129 kilometers) to the north.\n\nIn a statement, the migrants lambasted Mexican officials for directing them northward through the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, calling it the \u201croute of death.\u201d Some migrants branched off in the belief that they were near the metropolises of Puebla and Mexico City, where they aimed to rest and receive medical attention.\n\nJoel Eduardo Espinar is determined to continue the arduous trek with his family.\n\nA trek via the sugar fields and fruit groves of Veracruz takes them through a state where hundreds of migrants have disappeared in recent years, falling prey to kidnappers looking for ransom payments.\n\nAuthorities in Veracruz said in September they had discovered remains from at least 174 people buried in clandestine graves. Some security experts have questioned whether those bodies belonged to migrants.\n\nIbis Villanueva, 32, said he decided to strike out on his own for Puebla because he felt frustrated by the lack of organization in the caravan.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe the coordinators anymore. Yesterday they said we were going on bus, today no,\u201d said the sunburned welder from Honduras.\n\nGerardo Perez, a 20-year-old migrant, said he was tired. \u201cThey\u2019re playing with our dignity. If you could have only seen the people\u2019s happiness last night when they told us that we were going by bus and today we\u2019re not,\u201d he said.\n\nThe caravan\u2019s \u2018strength in numbers\u2019 strategy has enabled them to mobilize support as they move through Mexico and has inspired subsequent migrants to try their luck via caravan.\n\nMexico now faces the unprecedented situation of having three caravans stretched over 300 miles (500 kilometers) of highway in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz, with a total of more than 6,000 migrants.\n\nOn Friday, a caravan from El Salvador waded over the Suchiate River into Mexico, bringing 1,000 to 1,500 people who want to reach the U.S. border.\n\nThat caravan initially tried to cross the bridge between Guatemala and Mexico, but Mexican authorities told them they would have to show passports and visas and enter in groups of 50 for processing.\n\nAnother caravan, also of about 1,000 to 1,500 people, entered Mexico earlier this week and is now in Chiapas. That group includes Hondurans, Salvadorans and some Guatemalans.\n\nThe first, largest group of mainly Honduran migrants entered Mexico on Oct. 19. At its peak that caravan swelled to an estimated 7,000 participants.\n\nMexican officials appear conflicted over whether to help or hinder their journeys.\n\nImmigration agents and police have at times detained migrants in the smaller caravans. There has also been pressure on the main caravan, with federal police pulling over freight trucks and forcing migrants off, saying that clinging to the tops or sides of the trucks was dangerous.\n\nBut several mayors have rolled out the welcome mat for migrants who reached their towns - arranging for food and camp sites. Mexico\u2019s Interior Department says nearly 3,000 of the migrants in the first caravan have applied for refuge in Mexico and hundreds more have returned home.\n\nWith or without the government\u2019s help, uncertainty awaits.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has ordered U.S. troops to the Mexican border in response to the caravans. More than 7,000 active duty troops have been told to deploy to Texas, Arizona and California ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nHe plans to sign an order next week that could lead to the large-scale detention of migrants crossing the southern border and bar anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writer Amy Guthrie in Mexico City contributed to this report.", "Arizona Coyotes center Nick Cousins (25) celebrates with teammates after scoring a goal against the Carolina Hurricanes during the first period of an NHL hockey game Friday, Nov. 2, 2018, in Glendale, Ariz.

Smithsonian Museum staffers from Washington, D.C., raved over the Ricaritas. Its bread with praline sauce is most appealing.

Krause, Sauerberg and Kreider are teachers; Stieber is the community school coordinator. The purpose of the program is to increase attendance at Lincoln, a school that has suffered from significant rates of student absenteeism. (Grace Connatser/Milwaukee Neighborhood News Service via AP)\n\nMILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s dark in Lincoln Village at 6:30 in the morning, but the Lincoln Avenue School Walking School Bus lights up the sidewalk.\n\nAdult volunteers wear bright, reflective vests and carry a big yellow sign that says, \u201cWalking Bus.\u201d As children continue to join the sidewalk parade, neighbors smile and say hello. Laughter breaks through the quiet chirping of birds and the distant rumble of cars. Lincoln\u2019s crossing guard helps the kids cross the street safely as they walk beneath the arch guarding the courtyard.\n\nAngel Garcia Prado, 5, walks the route with his mother, Janeth Prado. She has volunteered with the bus since its beginning last year. He said he likes to hang out with his friend Jonathan Alvarado, 10, while walking to school. The hot chocolate at the end of the route also helps to warm up from the cold outside.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d Jonathan said. \u201cIt motivates me. I like to go to school more.\u201d\n\n---\n\nThe nonprofit news outlet Milwaukee Neighborhood News Service provided this article to The Associated Press through a collaboration with Institute for Nonprofit News.\n\n---\n\nPrado is part of the walking school bus leadership team at Lincoln Avenue School in Lincoln Village. She said it\u2019s helped her son and his friends to have more interest in school and learning, and she\u2019s glad it\u2019s helping other parents and their children. Even when it\u2019s cold outside, the route doesn\u2019t stop.\n\n\u201cOnce it got cold and snowy, we kept walking,\u201d Prado said. \u201cIt will continue to motivate students.\u201d\n\nThe other leader of the group is Regina Stieber, the community school coordinator at Sixteenth Street Community Health Center, a Lincoln partner. Stieber said she plans to expand the program in November by adding eight more kids to the route. All children on the route are hand-picked by school staff, including social workers, because of spotty attendance. As the year continues, the school will continue to monitor attendance patterns and invite families that would benefit to join the program.\n\n\u201cThere are new staff members willing to volunteer, even getting their sons and daughters involved,\u201d Stieber said. \u201cI think people are really inspired by the walking school bus and they love the kids that go here. ... The teachers here care so much that they\u2019re willing to give up a morning to walk the kids to school.\u201d\n\nMondays were very recently added to the route, which used to run only on Fridays. The school administration is also considering a second route that would run simultaneously with the existing route. The current route only runs south of the school with a maximum distance of two city blocks.\n\nThe purpose of the program is to increase attendance at Lincoln, a school that has suffered from significant rates of student absenteeism. The route picks up 13 students at their front door Mondays and Fridays, no matter the weather. The route spans 18th, 19th and Grant streets. Stieber has been running the program since August after the previous coordinator stepped down.\n\nPrincipal Yaribel Rodriguez, who has been at the school for four years, said the days with the highest rates of absences are Mondays, followed by Fridays. Many of those absences are repeated by the same children, resulting in a 12 percent rate of absenteeism for Lincoln students, Rodriguez added. She said the students who have been going to school more often due to the route have been submitting more classwork, leading not just to higher attendance, but also to higher grades.\n\n\u201cAttendance is important (because) if students aren\u2019t in the classroom, they\u2019re not learning,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cWe need to get them in our building consistently for the classroom instruction that they need.\u201d\n\nStieber also said parents are big fans of the program because many have said they feel unsafe walking their child to school in the morning in the dark. She said neighbors and others on the street honk and wave as the walking school bus passes by on the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cI felt like it was an opportunity to expand the scope of family engagement and the impact on the community,\u201d Stieber said.\n\nRodriguez said attendance rates have improved significantly since the program started last year. The current daily average at Lincoln is now at 91 percent, but she isn\u2019t stopping there. She hopes to bring it up to 95 percent soon. She said one student has proven to be an example of the impact the walking school bus has had on Lincoln.\n\n\u201cOne boy that was on the walking school bus was very detached from the school community ... coming to school about 50 percent of the time,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cNow, his attendance is closer to 80 percent. We also see him socializing more, we see him smiling more. We see him engage with the adults in the building, so it\u2019s helped him succeed.\u201d\n\nRyan Hurley, the Milwaukee Community Schools Partnership director at United Way, said other schools in the Milwaukee Public Schools system are looking at Lincoln as an example of creative ways to engage students, families and the surrounding community. He said that as a community school, much of what happens at Lincoln originates directly from the parents in the community. Since many parents cited neighborhood safety as a top concern, Hurley said the walking school bus was a practical, and ultimately successful, solution.\n\n\u201cThe walking school bus is a perfect example of what community schools do,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cThey engage the community to ask, \u2018What are the challenges? What are the barriers to student success? How do we all come together to organize and address those challenges?\u2019\u201d\n\nOther community schools considering their own walking school bus program include Auer Avenue School, Longfellow School and Sarah Scott Middle School, Hurley added. He said community schools can create a network to \u201cshare their practices with each other\u201d to find the best solution for each school\u2019s specific needs.\n\nUnited Way has partnered with Lincoln to donate winter clothing to students in need, Stieber said. The donations of jackets, gloves and hats have provided necessary warmth to students who may otherwise go without, she added.\n\nStieber said she hopes parents will continue to be engaged with the school and put in the effort to help kids learn.\n\n\u201cWe have some amazing parents already involved, but hopefully we can inspire more parents to come in so it\u2019s a sustainable model for the community,\u201d she said.", "FILE - In this Jan. 20, 2018 file photo, Women's March demonstrators walk past the White House in Washington.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, file)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is in the final stretch of a 44-city blitz for the midterm elections, but the America he\u2019s glimpsed from the airport arrivals and his armored limousine is hardly a reflection of the nation as a whole.\n\nThe president has mostly traveled to counties that are whiter, less educated and have lower incomes than the rest of the United States, according to Census Bureau data. It\u2019s a sign that he is seeking to galvanize the same group of voters that helped carry him to victory in 2016.\n\nTrump has largely eschewed the big metropolises for smaller cities. He has been to Tampa, Nashville, Cleveland and Houston \u2014 where the arenas could accommodate his crowds. But he\u2019s primarily been jet-setting to smaller places such as Elko, Nevada (population 20,078). Or, Mosinee, Wisconsin (population 4,023). Or, Belgrade, Montana (population 7,874).\n\nWhen Trump stops at Belgrade on Saturday, historical records suggest he will be the second president to visit the Montana town named after Serbia\u2019s capital city. In 2009, Barack Obama held a town hall in Belgrade to promote the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSince March, Trump has crisscrossed the country like a salesman with a set territory. The majority of his trips have been to just nine states. They are Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Indiana, West Virginia and Nevada.\n\nTrump won eight of those states in 2016, but not Nevada. And this year, seven of them feature a major Senate race with a Democratic incumbent. The former casino magnate has visited one city twice for the midterms: Las Vegas.\n\nHere is a portrait of the America that the president is seeing:\n\nLOWER INCOMES\n\nTrump has journeyed to counties where it\u2019s slightly more of a struggle to reach and stay in the middle class.\n\nOut of his scheduled rallies, 74 percent are in counties with median incomes that fall below the national level. But he\u2019s brought tidings of a 49-year low unemployment rate and accelerated economic growth to places that mostly lag the median U.S. household income of $55,032.\n\nIn September, Trump went to Wheeling, West Virginia. The typical household income in the county surrounding Wheeling is $41,986, or about $13,000 below the national level. The metro area has lost 818 jobs in the 12 months that ended in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And for West Virginia, coal mine jobs have declined this year after a hiring bump in 2017.\n\n\u201cYour state is booming like never before,\u201d Trump told the crowd in Wheeling. \u201cAnd our great coal miners are back to work.\u201d\n\nTrump has visited a few affluent counties. He stopped by Rochester, Minnesota, where incomes are high because of the presence of the world-renowned Mayo Clinic. And during a special congressional election in August, the president campaigned in Delaware County, Ohio, where the median household income of $94,234 is just shy of being double the national average.\n\nFEWER COLLEGE DEGREES\n\nJust 18.1 percent of the adults in Elko County, Nevada hold a college degree. That\u2019s compared to 30.3 percent nationwide. Of the 43 places Trump is visiting, 28 have a below-average share of college graduates.\n\nElko\u2019s economy is unique because it relies on mining gold, instead of the office and health care jobs that often require a college diploma. The county has five active gold mines, according to the Nevada Commission on Mineral Resources. This makes it something of an outlier in country where mining metal ore accounts for 0.03 percent of all jobs.\n\nTrump went to Elko in part to help push for the re-election of Republican Sen. Dean Heller, who is in a tight race against Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen. Heller flattered the president \u2014 and provided the lone reference to the local economy \u2014 by telling him, \u201cI think everything you touch turns to gold.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump has gone to more educated counties, it\u2019s often because they have a major college campus and venues where people can gather. Missoula is home to the University of Montana and 41.8 percent of its adults are college graduates. The University of Missouri is in Columbia, where 46.8 percent of adults hold college degrees.\n\nRACE\n\nOther than his rallies at big cities, Trump has generally been in communities that are overwhelmingly white. The U.S. population is 73.3 percent white, but almost three-fourths of the places where the president has stumped for midterms are above that average.\n\nIn the county surrounding Council Bluffs, Iowa, 88.7 percent of the population is non-Hispanic whites. Trump told the crowd at his rally that Democrats would allow Central American gangs such as MS-13 to immigrate freely into the United States, a claim disputed by Democratic lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThey want to turn America, these Democrats \u2014 and that\u2019s what they want \u2014 into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and the MS-13 killers,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn the area around Council Bluffs, 6.1 percent of the population is of Mexican descent. About 1 percent are from other Hispanic nations. By comparison, 17.3 percent of the U.S. population is Hispanic.\n\nThe biggest outlier in Trump\u2019s schedule may be his rally Sunday in Macon, Georgia. Its county is 53.9 percent black, making it the lone place being visited by the president where minorities make up the majority of the population.\n\nTrump is going there to promote the gubernatorial candidacy of Republican Brian Kemp. He is running against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is trying to become the first black female governor in U.S. history.", "Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker, right, and Toronto Raptors guard Fred VanVleet battle for the ball during the first half of an NBA basketball game, Friday, Nov. 2, 2018, in Phoenix.

Phoenix, though, scored the next seven, tying it at 61-61 on Booker\u2019s 18-footer.\n\nDespite missing four free throws during that stretch, the Raptors responded with a 13-3 run to lead 74-64 after Fred VanVleet\u2019s 3-pointer with 2:04 left in the third quarter.

(Ben Garver/The Berkshire Eagle via AP)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 More than 30 million Americans have cast early ballots ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, eclipsing the 2014 early totals nationally and suggesting a high overall turnout for contests that could define the final two years of President Donald Trump\u2019s term.\n\nAt least 28 states have surpassed their 2014 early votes. And perhaps even more indicative of the unusual enthusiasm this midterm cycle, some states are approaching their early turnout from the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some highlights:\n\nMASSIVE TURNOUT\n\nThe 30.6 million ballots includes data from 48 states, with several of those still collecting absentee ballots and welcoming in-person early voters. The total early vote in 2014 was 28.3 million in an election where more than 83 million Americans voted. That was a low turnout (about 36 percent) even by usual standards of a midterm, when there\u2019s an expected drop off from presidential elections.\n\nForecasters aren\u2019t predicting that overall turnout this year will hit 2016 levels (137.5 million; more than 60 percent of the electorate), but Democratic and Republican analysts, along with independent political scientists, say turnout could approach 50 percent, levels not seen for a midterm since the turbulent 1960s.\n\nBOOMS IN STATES NOT USED TO EXCITING MIDTERMS\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to see Virginia more than doubling its 2014 early turnout. Voters there showed their intensity last year in their governor\u2019s race, with record absentee ballot requests and returns and a solid turnout for both parties.\n\nBut then there\u2019s Tennessee. The state has settled firmly into Republican-dominated territory. In 2014, there wasn\u2019t a single statewide race that received national attention or a truly competitive House election.\n\nBut with an open Senate seat thanks to the retirement of Republican Bob Corker, voters are more than eager this year. Through Thursday, early turnout was 217 percent of what it was in 2014. It\u2019s even approaching early turnout from 2016, at 80 percent of that presidential-year mark.\n\nSeveral other states with competitive Senate or governor\u2019s races \u2014 Texas, Nevada, Georgia, among others \u2014 are nearing double the 2014 early totals.\n\nDEMOCRATS EDGING REPUBLICANS NATIONALLY\n\nIn states that require party registration, Democrats have cast 41 percent of the early ballots, compared to 36 percent for Republicans. Party strategists on both sides say they are far exceeding their usual numbers in key locales \u2014 urban strongholds for Democrats and more rural counties for Republicans.\n\nA word of caution from prognosticators: The party analysis isn\u2019t always an indicator of final outcomes. There are crossover voters, even in this hyperpartisan era. And there are independents and third-party voters, as well. For the record, those latter groups account for about 23 percent of the ballots in party registration states.\n\nFor the scorekeepers, though, Virginia, among the states that doesn\u2019t have party registration, is replicating its 2017 voting boom \u2014 and Democrats swept the top offices last year even amid strong GOP turnout.\n\nYOUNG VOTERS IN FLORIDA\n\nTrends in Florida\u2019s early voting suggest a surge in young voters, a group that historically has low turnout in midterm cycles.\n\nOf the 124,000 Floridians aged 18 to 29 who had voted in person at early polling stations as of Thursday, nearly a third did not vote in the presidential election in 2016, according to analysis by University of Florida political science professor Daniel Smith. About half of those new voters were newly registered.\n\n\u201cThere are newly energized voters who sat out in 2016, or have registered since then, who are turning out. There\u2019s no question about that,\u201d Smith said.\n\nIn contrast, for people 65 and older who had voted early and in person, about 7 percent didn\u2019t vote in 2016.\n\nNEW VOTERS IN GEORGIA\n\nIt cannot be said enough: It\u2019s the voters who don\u2019t often participate in midterms who can make the big difference. There\u2019s plenty of evidence that both major parties\u2019 bases are enthusiastic, but a frequent Election Day voter being so excited that they vote early doesn\u2019t change the math.\n\nSo candidates like Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp in the Georgia governor\u2019s race are keeping their eye on how many non-2014 voters have cast ballots.\n\nAn analysis by Georgia-based data analyst Ryan Anderson finds that 36 percent of the 1.8 million early votes in Georgia are new voters. If that held through Election Day, it would be a huge number. Abrams\u2019 campaign believes it would benefit them, though Republicans nationally note that President Donald Trump brought many new voters to the polls in 2016 \u2014 and those voters are still \u201cnew\u201d midterm voters.\n\nThat said, at least in Georgia, the racial and gender breakdown of the new voters bodes well for Abrams, who is trying to spike turnout among nonwhites, women and millennials.\n\nAnderson\u2019s analysis finds that barely more than half of the new voters are white in a state where the GOP wants the white share of the electorate to be push toward the mid-60s. Among the other findings: new female voters outnumber men by more than 70,000.\n\nThe bright spot for Kemp: More than half of early votes come from voters over 65 (though that total includes all races), and there is intense turnout in many of the state\u2019s most conservative areas beyond metro Atlanta.\n\n-----\n\nNegrete reported from New York.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump ordered troops to the border in response to a caravan of migrants slowly making its way through Mexico toward the United States and still about 900 miles away, with many dropping out. Here\u2019s what we know so far about the military\u2019s mission:\n\nWHAT TROOPS ARE INVOLVED?\n\nMore than 7,000 active duty troops have been told to deploy to Texas, Arizona and California. They are a mix of forces, including military police, an assault helicopter battalion, various communications, medical and headquarters units, combat engineers, planners and public affairs units.\n\nAs of Friday, one week after the Pentagon acknowledged that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had approved a Department of Homeland Security request for military support at the border, the troop deployment was still unfolding, with about 3,500 at staging bases in the Southwest. Of those, about 2,250 active duty troops are at staging bases in Texas, about 1,100 Marines are at Camp Pendleton in California and fewer than 200 are in Arizona. About 100 troops are actually on the border, at the port crossing near McAllen, Texas.\n\nMost of the troops are being used to facilitate the movement of border patrol agents, house them, feed them and provide some of their protection.\n\nWHAT IS THEIR ROLE ON THE BORDER?\n\nThe Pentagon is adamant that active duty troops will not do law enforcement, which they are forbidden from doing under the Posse Comitatus Act in the Constitution. Troops can\u2019t arrest people at the border. Their main job will be to support the Border Patrol.\n\nThis means the military will transport border patrol agents to and along the border, help them erect additional vehicle barriers and fencing along the border, assist them with communications and provide some security for border agent camps. The military also will provide the border patrol agents with medical care, pre-packaged meals, and temporary housing.\n\nWILL TROOPS BE ARMED?\n\nYes, many of them will be, mainly for self-protection.\n\nMilitary police at the border will be armed, although they will have non-lethal options for dealing with unexpected conflict. Pentagon officials say they are planning for a worst-case scenario of violence that could force soldiers to rely on their training to make split-second decisions to defend themselves or civilians. MPs might, for example, be dispatched to provide armed security for military engineers placing barricades at locations where there are no border patrol agents to provide protection.\n\nOne day after Trump suggested soldiers on the southwest border may open fire if migrants throw rocks at them, he insisted Friday that he meant that rock-throwers would be arrested. \u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018shoot,\u2019\u201d he told reporters at the White House. Either way, his scenario of violence captures in a nutshell the risk of using active duty troops for domestic security: Their mission does not include confronting migrants, but some may be unable to avoid it.\n\nThe commander in charge of the military operation, Air Force Gen. Terrence O\u2019Shaughnessy, head of U.S. Northern Command, said earlier this week that handling migrants will be primarily the job of the Customs and Border Protection agency. But he acknowledged \u201cthere could be incidental interaction\u201d between migrants and soldiers. In light of that possibility, the soldiers \u201care going to be fully trained in how to do that,\u201d he said.\n\nLt. Col. Jamie Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the military will not disclose details of its rules on the use of force.\n\nDOES CONGRESS SUPPORT THIS MISSION?\n\nWith members of Congress focused mainly on Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, reaction has been mild. A group of senior House Democrats wrote a letter to Mattis on Thursday expressing opposition to the military mission and demanding answers on its cost. The deployment of active duty troops, they wrote, \u201conly exacerbates the potential to unnecessarily escalate the situation.\u201d\n\nChuck Hagel, a former Republican senator and Army combat veteran who served as defense secretary under President Barack Obama, told CNN the mission is \u201cfolly\u201d because there is \u201cno need, no threat.\u201d\n\nRetired Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, who preceded Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, took double-barreled aim at the border mission. Writing on Twitter Thursday, he called the military mission a \u201cwasteful deployment of over-stretched Soldiers and Marines\u201d that would be \u201cmade much worse\u201d if they used force disproportional to the threat they face on the border.", "Time to usher out daylight saving time in most of America\n\nGraphic to be used as a reminder to turn back the clocks an hour; 1c x 1 inches; 46.5 mm x 25 mm;\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s time to usher out daylight saving time across most of the United States and welcome back standard time.\n\nThe shift means it\u2019s lighter earlier in the morning, and darkness on the edge of town comes sooner in the evening.\n\nAt 2 a.m. local time Sunday, daylight saving time is ending, and standard time returns for most people.

Three smaller ones are following behind it.\n\nTrump\u2019s recent statements include that he plans to sign an order that could lead to the detention of migrants crossing the southern border, and barring anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum. Both propositions are legally dubious.

Immigrants have built that country,\u201d she said.\n\nIn June, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that domestic and gang violence would generally no longer be accepted as reasons for migrants to be granted asylum. Trump has said this week that those in the caravan would not get asylum \u2014 though U.S. law allows them the right to apply \u2014 and warned them to turn around.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s vehement opposition and tough rhetoric has at least some in the caravan weighing alternatives.\n\nTifany Morandis, 19, was traveling with her husband, 28-year-old Javier Sanchez, and their two sons, 7-year-old Angel and 9-month-old Cesar.

But we played unselfish, exploiting that pick-and-roll and mixing rolls with pops,\u201d said Gasol, who added 10 rebounds and seven assists, often initiating from the high post.\n\nUtah played without star guard Donovan Mitchell, the team\u2019s leading scorer. He sat out with a right hamstring strain.\n\nThe Jazz missed their creative star on offense, and Conley said: \u201cIt definitely helped that Donovan didn\u2019t play.\u201d\n\nBut the team pinned this loss on failing to stop the Grizzlies.\n\n\u201cOur group has to stake its claim on the defensive end,\u201d Utah coach Quin Snyder said. \u201cNo matter who\u2019s out there, that\u2019s something that we can control. ...

Again and again and again.\n\nThe family of six \u2014 made up of stallion Lucky Duck, mares Virginia Dare, Ocean Pearl, Bonita and Kitty Hawk and one yearling colt, Mateo \u2014 tried to circumvent the barrier fence separating their Carolina habitat from Virginia multiple times.\n\nCorolla herd manager Meg Puckett wrote a post on the Corolla Wild Horse Fund website explaining the escapades of the six troublesome mustangs.\n\n\u201cFor an intrepid horse, getting into Virginia is certainly possible, but over the past 15-20 years there have been very few instances of that happening,\u201d Puckett said in the post.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what the \u201cRenegade 6\u201d did.\n\nBeginning in January, CWHF began hearing that the 6 were \u201cmaking their way around (or up, over, or through) the northern barrier fence and into False Cape State Park in Virginia.\u201d\n\nBut those journeys were dangerous for the horses, and for people, Puckett said.\n\n\u201cWhile we hoped that maybe it was just a one-time exploration, we were pretty sure that the horses were establishing patterns and territory up in Virginia,\u201d Puckett said.\n\nThe horses were moved back to their refuge in North Carolina multiple times \u2014 even to its southernmost tip \u2014 but they kept making their way back north.\n\nPuckett said stallion Lucky Duck is young and protective of his little herd, so he may have been \u201cmoving away from the pressure of other stallions.\u201d\n\nSo CWHF had to come up with a solution.\n\nInitially, they tried to get the volunteer-built fence extended \u2014 but the swampy marsh beyond where it stands now would be difficult and require a special contractor, Puckett said.\n\n\u201cOur mission is, first and foremost, to keep the horses wild, in their natural habitat, and we were hoping that this could be the case for the six that were starting to call Virginia their home. Unfortunately, the timing just didn\u2019t work out,\u201d Puckett said.\n\nVirginia officials were concerned that the horses could end up in populated areas near Virginia Beach. The horses \u201cwere deemed a nuisance by the Department of the Interior\u201d and CWHF \u201chad no choice but to allow them to be removed and brought to our rescue farm.\u201d\n\nThe horses aren\u2019t wild anymore, but they\u2019re safe, Puckett said.\n\n\u201cWe attempted to move them back to safer locations around Carova at least six or seven times, and each time they went straight back to False Cape in a matter of days,\u201d Puckett told The News & Observer in an interview on Monday. \u201cThere was great concern that they\u2019d continue to move north, and it\u2019s only a couple of miles until they would have been in Virginia Beach proper. We still plan on extending the fence because we don\u2019t want this to happen again \u2014 even if it\u2019s not for another 20 years.\u201d\n\nThe decision to move the horses from the wild was not one done lightly, Puckett told the N&O.\n\n\u201cIt was truly heartbreaking. It\u2019s almost like coping with a death, losing such a nice, young group of horses from the wild herd,\u201d she said. \u201cBut knowing they\u2019re safe now makes it a little easier. There were many times during their adventures that we\u2019re lucky someone wasn\u2019t seriously injured. It was a really stressful couple of months.\u201d\n\nMateo, born in April of this year, was adopted by a family with two other rescued wild horses and other animals on a farm outside of Lexington, Va., Puckett said.\n\nThe rest of the family will be at the farm \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d with plans to keep Lucky Duck as an educational outreach ambassador horse and a breeding stallion for the captive herd.\n\nFor more information on the Renegade 6, or to donate to their care, go to www.corollawildhorses.com.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The News & Observer, http://www.newsobserver.com", "AIKEN, S.C.

It\u2019s about him growing up, and J.D. and I weave fiction into the factual sequence of events in his life that led up to him writing \u2018Dracula.\u2019\u201d\n\nDacre chose Barker to help him create \u201cDracul\u201d for a couple of reasons.\n\nBefore they met, Dacre read \u201cForsaken\u201d and was impressed.\n\n\u201cIt just knocked me for a loop,\u201d he said.\n\nThen Dacre spent a few hours with Barker at a Horror Writers Association conference, and they really hit it off when they shared their ideas.\n\n\u201cI knew that we were compatible to work together,\u201d Dacre said.\n\nTheir joint effort with \u201cDracul\u201d involved a lot of research. Dacre and Barker studied Bram\u2019s notes for \u201cDracula,\u201d and also examined the \u201cDracula\u201d typescript owned by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.\n\nAmong the \u201cDracul\u201d co-authors\u2019 other sources were the short story \u201cDracula\u2019s Guest\u201d and \u201cMakt Myrkranna,\u201d an early version of \u201cDracula.\u201d\n\nTo make sure \u201cDracul\u201d was historically and geographically accurate, Dacre traveled to England and Ireland to visit the significant locations used in the book.\n\n\u201cHe (Barker) was the main writer because that was his strength,\u201d Dacre said. \u201cI was the guy providing information and checking things. We created a timeline of Bram\u2019s life because I wanted to make \u2018Dracul\u2019 as realistic as possible.\u201d\n\nBram was born in Ireland in 1847, and he died in England in 1912. \u201cDracula\u201d was published in 1897.\n\nReaders of \u201cDracul\u201d will learn that Bram was a sickly child, who spent his early days bedridden in his parents\u2019 Dublin home.\n\n\u201cMy theory is that he had respiratory allergies and asthma,\u201d Dacre said.\n\nOne of the characters in \u201cDracul\u201d is Bram\u2019s caretaker, a young woman named Ellen Crone. After a series of deaths in a nearby town, Bram and his sister, Matilda, discover Crone\u2019s bizarre pattern of behavior.\n\nBram\u2019s experiences with the supernatural that follow in \u201cDracul\u201d and his battle with evil will leave readers with the impression that he decided to write \u201cDracula\u201d as a \u201cwarning to the world,\u201d Dacre said.\n\nParamount Pictures has acquired the screen rights to \u201cDracul.\u201d Based on published reports, it could be a future project for Andy Muschietti, who directed the 2017 film adaption of Stephen King\u2019s horror novel \u201cIt.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled about it, but I\u2019m also thrilled that I don\u2019t have to do anything about it,\u201d said Dacre of the possibility that \u201cDracul\u201d will become a movie. \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough dealing with the publishing side.\u201d\n\nDacre also is the co-author, with Ian Holt, of \u201cDracula: The Un-Dead,\u201d a sequel to \u201cDracula.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Dacre is the co-editor of \u201cThe Lost Journal of Bram Stoker: The Dublin Years.\u201d\n\nFor more information, visit bramstokerestate.com.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Aiken Standard, http://www.aikenstandard.com", "Today in History\n\nToday is Saturday, Nov. 3, the 307th day of 2018.

(AP Photo/Richard W. Rodriguez)\n\nDALLAS (AP) \u2014 Allonzo Trier\u2019s two-way contract with New York is looking more and more like a one-way deal.\n\nAs in, the rookie guard isn\u2019t leaving the Knicks anytime soon.\n\nTrier scored 19 of his career-high 23 points during a second-half surge, fellow rookie Mitchell Robinson had his first double-double and the Knicks beat Dallas 118-106 Friday night, handing the Mavericks their sixth straight loss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here, what is this, 10 games now?\u201d Trier asked, overshooting the number by one after missing just two shots (8 of 10). \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun and I\u2019m learning more each and every day, and we\u2019re learning more about everybody on this team and how to use everybody, not just me.\u201d\n\nTim Hardaway Jr. had 18 points and six rebounds to help the Knicks win for the second time in three games after a five-game skid that followed a victory in their opener.\n\nRobinson set career highs with 13 points and 10 rebounds. New York outscored Dallas 33-18 in the third quarter after trailing by three at halftime, and led by as many as 17 in the fourth, when Trier scored 14 .\n\nDennis Smith Jr. scored 23 points and 19-year-old rookie Luka Doncic had 18 points, nine rebounds and six assists for the Mavericks, who matched their longest losing streak from the lost 2017-18 season.\n\nThat six-game skid a year ago led to a 2-14 start and 24-58 finish, and this slump followed a 2-1 start that marked Dallas\u2019 first winning record since the end of the 2015-16 season. The Mavericks opened 2-13 two seasons ago.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we\u2019ve got to get angry,\u201d coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get more together. We\u2019ve got to have two great practice days. That\u2019s where we are.\u201d\n\nThe Knicks shot just 24 percent from 3-point territory against the worst defending team from long range, but they made up for it inside the arc. New York shot 71 percent (39 of 55) on 2-pointers and was at 55 percent overall for the game.\n\nLance Thomas scored nine of his 10 points when the Knicks took control in the third and assisted during the surge on Robinson\u2019s reverse alley-oop dunk .\n\n\u201cI was high in the air, so why not just go ahead and do something?\u201d asked Robinson, the former Louisiana high school standout whose previous rebounding high was six.\n\nDorian Finney-Smith had 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting for the Mavericks, but Harrison Barnes was held to 1 of 7 from 3-point range while scoring 14 points. DeAndre Jordan had a season-low four points and matched his lowest rebounding total this season with 10.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nKnicks: Damyean Dotson just missed his second double-double of the season, finishing with 11 points and eight rebounds. ... Others among the seven double-figure scorers were Enes Kanter (13 points) and Mario Hezonja (11).\n\nMavericks: G Devin Harris was out again with a left hamstring strain. He hasn\u2019t played since the opener. ... J.J. Barea matched his season low with two points, attempting just five shots. He equaled Doncic with six assists.\n\nMITCHELL\u2019S MODEL\n\nRobinson\u2019s best game so far came against Jordan, the 6-foot-11 center who extended his Dallas record with his ninth straight double-digit rebound game to start a season. Robinson matched Jordan on the boards and was much more of a factor offensively, going 5 of 6 from the field. \u201cI think DeAndre is a guy that Mitchell looks up to, and really respects,\u201d Knicks coach David Fizdale said. \u201cObviously there are a lot of similarities there that we\u2019re going to be using DeAndre as a model for Mitchell.\u201d\n\nDEFENSE FIRST\n\nAnother versatile game from Doncic, who has been Dallas\u2019 best player in his first two-plus weeks, prompted questions for Carlisle over whether the rookie should have a more prominent role in the offense. Carlisle was thinking about the sixth game out of nine in which the Mavericks have allowed at least 50 percent shooting. \u201cI\u2019m so much more focused on the defense that the questions about the offense, to me, are insignificant,\u201d the coach said. \u201cIt\u2019s become too commonplace. That\u2019s not going to get it, and I know we can do better.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBoth teams play Washington.

(AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump attacked Democrats in one corner of Florida on Saturday, while Margaritaville king Jimmy Buffett took musical shots at him and Gov. Rick Scott in another as the state\u2019s tight Senate and gubernatorial races reached the final weekend of campaigning.\n\nBoth sides went to strongholds, with Trump holding a rally in conservative Pensacola with Scott, who is challenging U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, and former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, who is running for governor. He praised both Republicans, called Gillum a \u201cradical socialist\u201d and said Nelson never calls him to push programs that would benefit Florida.\n\nBuffett performed at a Democratic campaign rally in liberal West Palm Beach for Nelson and Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who is running for governor, urging the audience to vote for the pair by tweaking the lyrics of two of his most popular songs.\n\nBuffett, taking a dig at Trump, changed the wording of \u201cCome Monday\u201d to \u201cCome Tuesday, things will change. Come Tuesday, we\u2019re making a change. It\u2019s been two insane years and it\u2019s time to really switch gears.\u201d The performance was 3 miles (5 kilometers) from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort and frequent winter hangout.\n\nThen, using \u201cMargaritaville,\u201d he criticized Scott for the state\u2019s environmental problems: \u201cSome people say that there\u2019s a red tide to blame, but I know that it\u2019s all Rick Scott\u2019s fault.\u201d Red tide algae have killed millions of fish off the southern Florida coasts over the last several months \u2014 it occurs naturally but some scientists say pollution makes it worse. Buffett, who lives in Palm Beach, is an outspoken environmentalist, founding the charity \u201cSave the Manatee\u201d in 1981.\n\nBoth Scott and Gillum resumed campaigning Saturday after briefly returning to Tallahassee to visit victims and their families of Friday night\u2019s mass shooting at a yoga studio that left two women and the gunman dead and five injured.\n\nGillum referenced the shooting in his West Palm Beach address, first asking the crowd to keep the victims in their prayers. He then said such mass shootings have become \u201ctoo familiar\u201d in Florida. In February, 17 died in a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in nearby Parkland. In 2017, five died at Fort Lauderdale\u2019s airport. And in 2016, 49 died at an Orlando nightclub.\n\nGillum said voters need to \u201csend an unapologetic message to the NRA that their time is up in Florida\u201d and called for tighter gun laws, including tougher background checks and a ban on convicted domestic abusers owning guns.\n\n\u201cWe can celebrate what it means to have the Second Amendment and celebrate safety and security in our homes, in our neighborhoods, in our schools, in our houses of worship at the same time,\u201d Gillum said.\n\nTrump takes frequent digs at Gillum in speeches and on Twitter, saying Saturday that Gillum wants open borders and runs a violent city. DeSantis won the Republican nomination after receiving Trump\u2019s endorsement, in large part for his appearances on Fox News praising the president\u2019s policies and denouncing the probe led by Robert Mueller into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nTrump said if Gillum wins, \u201che\u2019ll destroy Florida in one year or two years\u201d and illegal immigrants will be camping on Floridians\u2019 lawns.\n\nDeSantis praised Trump, saying he kept his promises on taxes, judges and Iran, and said Gillum, who has called for banning assault rifles, will raise taxes and ban most guns. He joked that he would try to lure the Trump Organization from New York City to Florida, where there are lower taxes.\n\n\u201cAre we going to build on the success Florida has had or are we going to put a far-left, Bernie Sanders, anti-law enforcement, tax-raising radical in the governor\u2019s mansion?

With tailbacks Hall and Qadree Ollison each weighing in at 225 pounds, their bruising style wore Virginia down during two long possessions to begin the second half.\n\nVirginia: The Cavaliers to find more offensive weapons to employ when teams focus great attention on Perkins, Olamide Zaccheaus and Jordan Ellis. Terrell Jana\u2019s 42-yard touchdown catch more than doubled his receiving yardage for the season (29), and he caught two more passes before halftime. And tight end Tanner Cowley had just three catches for 28 yards in the first eight games before taking a pass from Perkins 40 yards down the Virginia sideline in the first half.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPittsburgh returns home to face long-time rival Virginia Tech in its final home game.\n\nVirginia wraps up a three-game homestand with its final home game, and last out-of-conference game, against Liberty.\n\n___\n\nFollow Hank on Twitter: www.twitter.com/hankkurzjr\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "FILE - In this May 20, 2018, file photo, Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp participates in a debate in Atlanta. Former President Jimmy Carter is wading into the final days of a Georgia governor's race that's rife with charges and countercharges of attempted voter fraud and attempted voter suppression. In a letter Carter asked Republican nominee Kemp to resign from his post as Georgia secretary of state. Kemp is locked in a tight race with Democrat Stacey Abrams, whom Carter has endorsed. (AP Photo/John Amis, File)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 With early and absentee voting underway ahead of the Nov. 6 election, Democrats and voting rights groups in Georgia are staging massive voter protection operations, including poll monitors and voter assistance hotlines, to ensure people can access the ballot.\n\n\u201cWe now talk to more than 700 voters on an average day, and call volume has picked up considerably,\u201d Democratic Party of Georgia spokesman Seth Bringman said of their voter protection hotline.\n\nAt issue is Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp\u2019s run for governor against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who would be the first black female governor in U.S. history if elected.\n\nVoting rights groups say Kemp, the state\u2019s chief elections officer, can\u2019t impartially oversee his own election and his office has a history of voter suppression. Kemp, who has bucked calls to resign or recuse himself, says he is following the law and has made it easier to vote in Georgia.\n\nProminent state Republicans have called the controversy \u201cmanufactured\u201d and said it was meant to gin up support for Democrats ahead of the election. Kemp has also swung back at Abrams by saying that she is advocating for \u201cillegals to vote\u201d for her, which Abrams denies.\n\nThe fight in many ways mirrors a national debate about balancing access to the polls with security at the polls. And it has similarly spilled into the partisan arena.\n\nRepublicans in Georgia, including Kemp, have pushed for strict voter ID laws, citizenship checks and aggressive voter roll maintenance in the name of protecting elections against fraud and noncitizens voting.\n\nBut Georgia Democrats, Abrams chief among them, say the policies are purposefully heavy-handed and make voting more difficult for legal citizens, especially minority voters that tend to lean Democrat.\n\nKemp and Abrams, a former state representative, have battled over voting rights and access for years in the Deep South state.\n\nTensions grew after an Associated Press report in early October that more than 53,000 voter applications \u2014 nearly 70 percent of them from black applicants \u2014 were on hold with Kemp\u2019s office ahead of the election.\n\nMany of the applications were flagged for failing to pass the state\u2019s \u201cexact match\u201d verification process, which requires that identification information on voter registration applications precisely match information held by Georgia Department of Driver Services or the Social Security Administration.\n\nKemp\u2019s office says that eligible voters on the \u201cpending\u201d list can still vote if they bring a proper ID that substantially matches their registration information.\n\nBut critics say county officials aren\u2019t always trained to make the proper determination and the system can be particularly hard to navigate for recently naturalized citizens, because other state databases are not automatically updated.\n\nThe law is the subject of a lawsuit brought by civil rights groups currently working its way through federal courts.\n\nA judge on Friday issued an injunction ordering the state to change its procedure to allow people flagged as noncitizens greater opportunity to prove their citizenship at the polls. She ruled that Georgia must immediately start allowing poll managers to clear flagged voters who show proof of citizenship to vote a regular ballot, when only deputy registrars could previously.\n\nThe ACLU and other groups brought legal action after reports surfaced that one metro Atlanta county was rejecting absentee ballots at a high rate over signatures not matching those on file.\n\nLast week, a federal judge issued an injunction ordering Kemp\u2019s office to issue guidance to county officials to stop rejecting ballots because of a signature mismatch without first giving voters a chance to fix the problem.\n\nIn another incident, about 40 black seniors were ordered off a bus taking them from a senior center to early vote by county officials, who said they considered the trip improperly political.\n\nKemp\u2019s office said those issues involved county officials, not his office, and his office was investigating. They say that county officials run elections.\n\nKemp and Republicans have strongly pushed back on the assertion that, either through malice or mismanagement, his office has implemented policies and backed laws that sow confusion and make it more difficult for legal citizens to vote.\n\nKemp\u2019s campaign called the incidents \u201cfake\u201d and blamed Abrams.\n\n\u201cAny voter confusion in our state rests on the shoulders of Stacey Abrams \u2014 who is obviously too extreme and dishonest for Georgia,\u201d Kemp spokesman Ryan Mahoney said.\n\nIn a recent campaign statement, Kemp also said that minority participation is up and turnout records have been exceeded during his tenure as secretary of state.\n\n\u201cSeven million Georgians are now on our voter rolls \u2014 that\u2019s one million more than when I took office in 2010,\u201d Kemp said.\n\nKemp\u2019s office said voters have several ways to address questions or complaints: a dedicated call center, an online portal implemented by Kemp and an email system for addressing issues. And in many cases, county poll workers can help solve problems on the spot, Kemp\u2019s office said.\n\nBut a number of voting rights and ethics watchdog groups are concerned that, with the variety of issues voters are experiencing, those services aren\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a domino effect,\u201d said Sara Henderson, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, about the voting issues in Georgia. \u201cWe expect lots of problems at the polling places because there has been a complete lack of voter education.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 The Detroit Tigers claimed reliever Jose Fernandez and infielder Brandon Dixon off waivers.\n\nThe team announced the moves Friday.\n\nThe 25-year-old Fernandez made his major league debut this year with Toronto, posting a 6.10 ERA in 13 relief appearances.

Wall\u2019s Wizards have not.\n\nThe Thunder have gone from 0-4 to 4-4, picking up their fourth consecutive victory by beating the struggling, booed-at-home Wizards 134-111 behind Westbrook\u2019s 23 points and 12 assists Friday night.\n\nThe outcome was decided in the second quarter, when OKC outscored Washington 44-20, a lopsided result Wizards coach Scott Brooks called \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just pride ourselves on defense, starting with myself and going down the line.

I\u2019m going to continue to pride myself on that starting with myself: Defend at a high level and go on down the line.\u201d\n\nThe Wizards wish they could play well at that end of the court.\n\nEven though OKC was the team playing on the second night of a back-to-back, it looked a lot fresher and more active than Washington, which was coming off a two-day break and finally got to see new center Dwight Howard make his debut.\n\nAfter missing all of training camp, every exhibition game and the first seven regular-season games with a sore backside, Howard started and immediately appeared to have an impact, scoring 13 first-quarter points. But soon enough, Washington got into its usual bad habits, the ones that have led to loss after loss so far: ineffective defense and low-effort rebounding.\n\n\u201cThey got layups after layups, wide-open 3s,\u201d Wall said. \u201cThey did whatever they wanted.\u201d\n\nThe Wizards have lost five games in a row to drop to 1-7, and spectators let the players hear their displeasure in the second quarter, jeering when OKC went ahead 61-40 on Jerami Grant\u2019s dunk on a pass from Westbrook. When Paul George made his third straight 3 attempt, a night after going 0 for 10 from beyond the arc, it made the halftime score 79-50, equaling the Thunder\u2019s record for most points in a half.\n\nAn Oklahoma City team averaging 109 points this season was already at 110 after three quarters.\n\nGeorge wound up with 17 points to surpass 10,000 for his career, and Grant scored 22.\n\nHoward had 20 points on 7-of-8 shooting, three rebounds and four fouls in 23 minutes. When he was out of the game, he either laid down on his stomach on the sideline or stood.\n\nBradley Beal scored 27 points, and Wall had 19 points and nine assists, but Washington\u2019s pair of All-Star guards also combined for 12 turnovers.\n\nThe Thunder went up by as many as 33 points in the third quarter and shot 57 percent for the game. They outrebounded the Wizards 38-30.\n\nNone of that should come as a surprise, given that Washington began the night allowing an NBA-worst 122.4 points per game and averaging only 41.3 rebounds, 27th in the 30-club league.\n\n\u201cI refuse,\u201d Beal said, \u201cto let the ship sink.\u201d\n\nTIP-INS\n\nThunder: Came in shooting 27 percent on 3s, but hit 47 percent \u2014 15 for 32 \u2014 against Washington. ...

(AP) \u2014 Things were going so well for Los Angeles Clippers guard Lou Williams on Friday night that even when one of his shots missed, he ended up getting credit for a basket.\n\nWilliams scored 23 of his game-high 28 points in the second half in leading the Clippers to a 120-95 rout of the Orlando Magic.\n\nIt was the Clippers\u2019 10th straight win over the Magic.\n\nWilliams hit all five 3-point attempts in the second half, including one that clearly bounced far off the rim. But he got credit anyway when referee Sean Corbin called goaltending on Magic rookie Mo Bamba.\n\n\u201cLou got it going in the third and fourth quarter and that changed the game,\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cHe is just an amazing, amazing shooter and he shoots from all angles. It used to be he could only go left and now he goes right.

Maybe this is going to be harder to do than I thought.\u201d\n\nGREAT FIRST IMPRESSION\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers invited Magic rookie Mo Bamba in for a workout before last summer\u2019s NBA Draft and he made quite an impression on coach Doc Rivers. Bamba brought a CD of himself that contained highlights of his best offensive moves to show how far his game had progressed.\n\n\u201cHe wanted us to see all that and it was impressive,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cSteve Ballmer (Clippers owner) was in the room and I think it was the most impressive interview we ever had in the times I\u2019ve done it.

Lincoln Riley was the Sooners\u2019 offensive coordinator in a 66-59, Baker Mayfield-over-Patrick Mahomes touchdown fest at Texas Tech two years ago and will be on the sideline at his alma mater Saturday night for the first time since replacing Bob Stoops.\n\nRiley believes Murray is ready to make the run that Mayfield pulled off a year ago \u2014 lead the Sooners (7-1, 4-1 Big 12) back from an early October loss to run the table in November, win a Big 12 championship and qualify for the four-team tournament.\n\n\u201cThe whole journey gets you ready for this,\u201d Riley said of Murray, who is expected to pursue pro baseball after one season as OU\u2019s starter. \u201cHe\u2019s been at big moments, even early on his life. Felt like if he won the job, that he\u2019d be ready for the opportunity.\u201d\n\nThis is just the beginning of high-profile Big 12 opportunities for Texas Tech freshman Alan Bowman, the conference\u2019s leading passer. The Red Raiders (5-3, 3-2) cost themselves a tie for the league lead with a 40-31 loss at Iowa State last week, but now get a chance to knock the Sooners out of that spot \u2014 and likely out of playoff consideration.\n\n\u201cI watched a guy who is favored to be the MVP of the NFL go up there and have a really, really rough day, as well,\u201d coach Kliff Kingsbury said, referring to the Red Raiders\u2019 66-10 loss at the Cyclones in Mahomes\u2019 final season two years ago, before Kansas City drafted him in the first round.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a kid who doesn\u2019t blink,\u201d Kingsbury said of Bowman, who was called for a safety on a desperation throwaway out of the end zone to break a 31-31 tie against Iowa State. \u201cGot that ball back at the end, expected to win the game. It didn\u2019t work out. He\u2019ll come back and play better than he has, is my expectation for him Saturday.\u201d\n\nThe Sooners, also seventh in the first CFP rankings released this week, bounced back with a pair of 50-plus-point outings in wins over TCU and Kansas State following a loss to No. 15 Texas.\n\n\u201cThese last couple weeks, we\u2019ve just been out there playing for each other,\u201d linebacker Kenneth Murray said. \u201cIt\u2019s not offense, special teams, defense.

McNeill was promoted at Texas Tech under similar circumstances in 2007, and spent the next two full seasons in that role before becoming head coach at East Carolina. He was with the Red Raiders for 10 seasons, including when Kingsbury was the quarterback.\n\nThe Sooners held the Horned Frogs and Wildcats to less than 300 yards. \u201cHe tells us all the time he lives in Norman now, and the best offense lives in Norman, the best defense lives in Norman, the best special teams lives in Norman,\u201d Kenneth Murray said.\n\nNOVEMBERS TO REMEMBER\n\nThe Sooners have won 13 consecutive November games since 2014, and not coincidentally have three straight Big 12 titles \u2014 all with Mayfield at quarterback. \u201cA lot of other people are getting tired of it, tired of the grind, the process, tired of all the little things these guys have got to do day-in and day-out,\u201d Riley said. \u201cOur players have embraced it.\u201d\n\nIT JUST SO HAPPENS\n\nMayfield, the first overall pick this past spring by Cleveland, and Mahomes are facing off in the NFL on the same weekend as their former college teams, with the Chiefs visiting the Browns on Sunday. It\u2019s just another reason to remember the video-game display in 2016, when each team had exactly 854 yards total offense and Mahomes threw 88 passes, one shy of the national record. Kingsbury said he didn\u2019t plan to watch Mahomes try to get the Chiefs to 8-1. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back at it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll keep track of it.\u201d\n\nTHIS AND THAT\n\nThe Sooners have won 18 straight true road games over four seasons. ...

But Obama framed Georgia\u2019s nationally watched matchup within a larger fight he said goes beyond partisanship.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday, you can vote for a politics that is decent, for a politics that is honest, for a politics that is lawful, for a politics that tries to do right by people,\u201d Obama said after a lengthy condemnation of the all-GOP government that has run Washington since Obama left office last January.\n\n\u201cMake history here in Georgia. Make things better here in Georgia,\u201d the nation\u2019s first black president said of Abrams\u2019 bid to become the first black female governor in American history.\n\nPolls show Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp in a tight race that has drawn national attention, even coaxing media icon Oprah Winfrey to Abrams\u2019 side Thursday \u2014 the kind of political move the billionaire businesswoman had largely avoided since her open support of Obama in 2008.\n\nObama twice lost Georgia by single-digit margins, but population growth among nonwhites and some discontent with Trump in the GOP-leaning, whiter suburbs of Atlanta leave Abrams\u2019 backers cautiously optimistic she can pull an upset in a state that hasn\u2019t elevated a Democrat to the governor\u2019s office since 1998.\n\nKemp has embraced Trump\u2019s nationalistic tone as he tries to extend the GOP dominance. Trump will travel Sunday to Georgia, appearing with Kemp as part of the president\u2019s final multistate tour ahead of the midterms.\n\nAbrams is running as an unapologetic liberal, marked by her pledge to reverse Georgia Republicans\u2019 refusal to expand Medicaid insurance under Obama\u2019s 2010 health care law.\n\nObama noted as much in his 45-minute speech at Morehouse. He chided Republicans, including Kemp, for opposing the Affordable Care Act and only recently turning to ads that tell voters GOP candidates will protect insurance access for Americans with once-disqualifying health conditions.\n\n\u201cI want everybody to pay attention to this: They have literally been doing the opposite of what they are saying,\u201d Obama said, noting scores of GOP votes to repeal the law. \u201cWe can also call it what it is: It\u2019s a lie.\u201d\n\nThe former president said the Republican campaign tactic on pre-existing conditions is just one component of \u201can old playbook\u201d to divide voters and distract from an agenda he said hurts the middle-class for the benefit of billionaires.\n\nHe mocked Trump\u2019s assertion that a migrant caravan coming north from Central America is fundamental threat. As he blasted Trump\u2019s decision to send troops to the Southern border, Obama failed to note that he and President George W. Bush also dispatched military personnel to the border, even if not immediately prior to an election.\n\nBesides Abrams, Obama recognized two other Democrats looking for upsets in congressional districts that span the northern Atlanta suburbs.\n\nLucy McBath is trying to unseat Rep. Karen Handel, who won a special election last year over Jon Ossoff in a race that became the most expensive House contest ever. Carolyn Bourdeaux is running against Rep. Rob Woodall, who\u2019s not faced a serious challenge since winning the seat during the 2010 midterms that were disastrous for Obama.\n\nThe districts aren\u2019t considered top tier pickup opportunities as Democrats try to gain the 23 seats they need for a majority, so a victory by either McBath or Bourdeaux likely would signify a big night nationally for Democrats.\n\nAtlanta was part of a two-stop day for Obama on behalf of potentially history-making candidates. He was in Florida earlier for Andrew Gillum, who would be his state\u2019s first black governor.\n\n-----\n\nFollow Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP .\n\n-----\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FILE - In this Oct. 5, 2018, file photo, Los Angeles Dodgers starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw throws to an Atlanta Braves batter during the first inning of Game 2 of a National League Division Series baseball game in Los Angeles.

Terrill, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Washington outfielder Bryce Harper and Boston closer Craig Kimbrel were among just seven free agents who received $17.9 million qualifying offers from their former clubs Friday, when Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw agreed to a $93 million, three-year contract rather than test the market.\n\nLeft-handers Patrick Corbin (Arizona), Dallas Keuchel (Houston) and Hyun-Jin Ryu (Los Angeles Dodgers) also received qualifying offers as did outfielder A.J. Pollock (Diamondbacks) and catcher Yasmani Grandal (Dodgers).\n\nPlayers have until Nov. 12 to accept. If a team makes a qualifying offer to a player who signs a major league contract with another club before the June amateur draft, his former club would receive a draft pick as compensation at the end of the first round.\n\nOnly five of 73 players given qualifying offers have accepted since the process began in 2012.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs exercised their $20 million option on left-hander Cole Hamels, who went 4-3 with a 2.36 ERA in 12 starts after he was acquired from Texas on July 27. The Cubs traded left-hander Drew Smyly to the Rangers, clearing his $7 million salary from the payroll. That is $1 million more than the Rangers would have owed the Cubs if Hamels\u2019 option had been declined, which would have triggered a $6 million buyout and allowed him to go free.\n\nKershaw terminated a $215 million, seven-year contract that had $65 million remaining at $32 million next year and $33 million in 2020. The new deal calls for a $23 million signing bonus, payable in equal installments on June 30 in each of the next three years, and annual salaries of $23,333,333. He can earn $4 million annually in performance bonuses, in four $1 million increments for 24, 26, 28 and 30 starts, which could raise the deal\u2019s value to $105 million over three years.\n\nHe also can gain award bonuses of $1.5 million for winning the NL Cy Young Award or $500,000 for finishing second or third in the voting.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of people saying that I\u2019m in decline or not going to be as good as I once was,\u201d said Kershaw, whose Dodgers lost in the World Series for the second straight year. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to proving a lot of people wrong with that.\u201d\n\nKershaw, who turns 31 in March, has spent all 11 of his big league seasons with the Dodgers.\n\n\u201cIt was more valuable to me to just stay here,\u201d he said. \u201cA chance to win every single year, it doesn\u2019t come around like this in LA very often.\u201d\n\nTop free agents prefer to seek multiyear contracts, but given the greater priority placed on draft picks in recent years, Ryu and Grandal might face a difficult market and consider accepting the offers.\n\nA free agent can be made a qualifying offer only if he has been with the same team continuously since opening day and has never received a qualifying offer before. Because of those rules, Manny Machado and Josh Donaldson were among the players who were ineligible to receive offers. The amount is the average of the top 125 major league contracts this year by average annual value.\n\nHarper and Machado are the top players available on the market, though Machado\u2019s value may have been damaged by a rocky postseason in which he hit .227, showed a remarkable lack of hustle and was fined $10,000 for stepping on a first baseman\u2019s foot.\n\nOthers among the 160 available free agents include right-handers Nathan Eovaldi and Charlie Morton, left-handers J.A. Happ and CC Sabathia, relievers Zach Britton, Andrew Miller, David Robertson and Jeurys Familia, outfielder Michael Brantley, third baseman Mike Moustakas, infielder Daniel Murphy, designated hitter Nelson Cruz and utilityman Marwin Gonzalez.\n\nKershaw was among four players who became free agents and immediately re-signed this week, joined by St. Louis right-hander Adam Wainwright, Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner and Dodgers outfielder David Freese.\n\nCleveland is interested in re-signing Brantley but did not want to commit $17.9 million for one year.\n\n\u201cWe could not have any more respect for any individual than we have for Michael,\u201d general manager Chris Antonetti said. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy that epitomizes, as I\u2019ve shared before, all of the things we look for in a player. He\u2019s exceedingly productive on the field. He defines professionalism in the clubhouse, and he\u2019s an extraordinary teammate. The interest and desire is there. What we will have to work through is, can we make the pieces fit?\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Beth Harris in Los Angeles and Tom Withers in Cleveland contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "", "", "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 A federal appeals court has rejected the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s appeal in a lawsuit involving absentee ballots.\n\nFriday\u2019s ruling comes amid the hotly contested Georgia governor\u2019s race between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp, who is Georgia\u2019s secretary of state.\n\nVoting rights groups had sued over Georgia\u2019s practice of rejecting absentee ballots and applications because of a mismatched signature is unconstitutional.\n\nA district judge granted a temporary restraining order, blocking election officials from rejecting absentee ballots based on the signature issue without giving voters a chance to contest the decision.\n\nThe state appealed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which kept the restraining order in place.\n\nSecretary of State spokeswoman Candice Broce said election officials are concerned that changing procedures this close to an election is inappropriate but will comply with the ruling."]
