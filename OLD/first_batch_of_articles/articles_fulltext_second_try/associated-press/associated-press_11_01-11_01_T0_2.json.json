["OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 The economy expanded in nine Midwestern and Plains states last month despite mounting concerns about tariffs and trade skirmishes, according to a report released Thursday.\n\nThe Mid-America Business Conditions Index slumped to 54.9 in October, from 57.5 in September , the report said. The October reading was the lowest since January 2017, but it also was the 23rd month in a row that the index has remained above growth neutral 50.0.\n\n\u201cThe regional economy continues to expand at a healthy pace,\u201d said Creighton University economist Ernie Goss, who oversees the survey. \u201cHowever, as in recent months, shortages of skilled workers remain an impediment to even stronger growth. Furthermore, supply managers are reporting mounting negative impacts from tariffs and trade skirmishes,\u201d he said.\n\nTrade restrictions, expanding tariffs and rising short-term interest rates are likely to slow regional growth in the months ahead, Goss said.\n\nThe survey results are compiled into a collection of indexes ranging from zero to 100. Survey organizers say any score above 50 suggests growth. A score below that suggests decline. The survey covers Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma and South Dakota.\n\nSurvey results cast a shadow on the October employment index, which dropped to 52.2 from 56.2 in September and 58.5 in August.\n\n\u201cOverall manufacturing employment growth in the region over the past 12 months has been very healthy at 2.4 percent, compared to a lower 2.2 percent for the U.S.,\u201d Goss said. \u201cI expect this gap to close in the months ahead as regional job growth slows faster than national manufacturing job growth.\u201d\n\nEconomic optimism, as reflected by the October index, plummeted to a still strong 59.6 from September\u2019s 68.0.\n\n\u201cIn terms of business confidence, rising trade tensions, tariffs, and interest rates have reduced economic optimism among supply managers in the region,\u201d Goss said.", "This photo provided by the Cole County Sheriff's Office in Missouri shows Quatavia Givens, who has been arrested and booked into jail on suspicion of first-degree child abuse in the death of 4-year-old Darnell Gray, whose body was found almost a week after she reported him missing.

No attorney who can speak on her behalf is listed in online court records.\n\nAfter Givens reported Darnell missing on Oct. 25, authorities went door-to-door, drained a retention pond and used a helicopter in the search for the boy. Givens didn\u2019t tell authorities where his body was until after it was found Tuesday in a wooded area in Jefferson City, according to charging documents. An autopsy determined he had suffered blunt and sharp force trauma.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my only child that I had, my only child,\u201d said Gray, who described his son as smiley and \u201cgoofy.\u201d \u2033He loved to run around with me. He loved to play basketball.\u201d\n\nGray told the TV station he moved from Chicago to Missouri a few years ago because he \u201cwanted a better life,\u201d and brought his son to Missouri six months ago. Gray said he\u2019s no longer with Darnell\u2019s mother, who still lives in Chicago.\n\nPolice Lt. David Williams declined to identify Darnell\u2019s parents or specify the relationship between Givens and Darnell\u2019s father, saying the department doesn\u2019t identify parents of juvenile victim. But he did say Givens and the father had separate addresses about one block apart at the time Darnell\u2019s disappearance. Williams said the father wasn\u2019t in Jefferson City when he was contacted about his son\u2019s disappearance.\n\nCharging documents said Givens initially told officers that Darnell either was abducted or ran away during the night. She later told police that she hurt the child, saying \u201cI may have hit him wrong,\u201d the statement said. It also said Givens, who is jailed without bond, had told investigators she planned to travel to Florida \u201cto get out of the area.\u201d\n\nWilliams said the investigation is ongoing and that he couldn\u2019t rule out additional charges against Givens or another suspect. \u201cBy no means do we think we are done,\u201d he said.\n\nCourt records show that a man identified as a having had a \u201cromantic/intimate social relationship\u201d with Givens filed an order of protection against her in May 2016. No details were offered about why the order was sought. The man doesn\u2019t have a listed phone number.\n\nAt the time of her arrest, Givens was on probation for stealing leased or rented property.

The founder and director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS, Doblin is pushing for the therapeutic potential of psychedelics including MDMA, best known by its street name, ecstasy. That effort moves into its final stage next month with two large-scale, government-sanctioned studies that will determine whether the Food and Drug Administration approves MDMA for post-traumatic stress disorder. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Growing up amid the tumult of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War, Rick Doblin says he became convinced that humanity was \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cinherently destructive.\u201d As a teenager, he came to see the mind-expanding effects of psychedelics \u2014 including LSD and magic mushrooms \u2014 as the antidote to mankind\u2019s inner demons.\n\nHe set out to prove it. And now, after 32 years of false starts, setbacks and regulatory hurdles, he has brought MDMA \u2014 the illegal, all-night party drug also known as ecstasy \u2014 to the brink of medical legitimacy.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has labeled the drug a potential \u201cbreakthrough\u201d for post-traumatic stress disorder and cleared late-stage studies of up to 300 patients. The studies are to be conducted by Doblin\u2019s nonprofit group dedicated to promoting mind-altering drugs, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS. Researchers will begin screening patients this month.\n\nThe goal is to win FDA approval by 2021. MDMA would become the first psychedelic drug \u2014 currently in the same ultra-restrictive category as heroin and cocaine \u2014 to make the leap to prescription medicine.\n\nDoblin does not plan to stop there. His aim is the legalization of all psychedelics for recreational use by 2035.\n\n\u201cPsychedelics have been used for thousands of years for healing and spiritual purposes,\u201d says Doblin, 64. \u201cI thought my contribution would be to bring them back.\u201d\n\nMAPS\u2019 work is part of a resurgence of interest into the therapeutic potential of psychedelics, a field that captivated researchers in the 1950s and 1960s before the government ban on LSD and other hallucinogens slammed the door shut in 1970.\n\n\u201cThis field was so taboo it was essentially erased from the history books,\u201d says Stephen Ross, a New York University psychiatrist who is studying psilocybin, the ingredient in magic mushrooms, for depression and alcohol addiction.\n\nRoss and other researchers are largely funded by the Heffter Research Institute, the other psychedelic nonprofit in the field. But Heffter executives adamantly oppose recreational use of psychedelics. They say the drugs are too risky to be used without professional supervision.\n\n\u201cTalking about full legalization of all psychedelics makes quite a number of people uncomfortable,\u201d says David Nichols, co-founder of Heffter and a retired pharmacology professor at Purdue University. \u201cBut that\u2019s Rick, he\u2019s got his base of people who give him a lot of money because they want to see him kick down the doors of government regulation.\u201d\n\nSPECTRUM OF SUPPORT\n\nFunding MAPS and the MDMA studies has meant relentless fundraising, more than $70 million over the years from by a wide array of wealthy backers.\n\n\u201cRick has this beautiful vision of healing the cultural divide of the sixties; having veterans and counterculture icons coming together,\u2019\u201d says David Bronner, CEO \u2014 Cosmic Engagement Officer \u2014of Dr. Bronner\u2019s Magic Soaps, the organic brand known for its quirky labels. Bronner has given $3.1 million to MAPS since 2005 and currently chairs its board of directors.\n\nEarlier this year Rebekah Mercer, the billionaire Republican and co-owner of Breitbart, pledged $1 million to fund the PTSD trials.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s veterans deserve the very best care,\u201d Mercer said in a statement announcing the grant.\n\nIf prescription MDMA is ever approved, revenue would flow to a pharmaceutical company entirely owned by MAPS. According to the company\u2019s charter, profits would fund research into new uses for MDMA and other psychedelics.\n\nBACK TO A PSYCHEDELIC FUTURE\n\nThe small studies published by MAPS and Heffter are dwarfed by research conducted roughly a half-century ago. Between 1950 and the mid-1960s more than 1,000 papers were published documenting 40,000 patients receiving LSD and other psychedelics for conditions like depression and addiction.\n\nOnly later would psychedelics become intertwined with the dayglow hippie culture of the 1960s and figures like Timothy Leary, the ex-Harvard professor who promoted psychedelics as a pseudo-religion.\n\nMDMA had its own medical history before being adopted by the electronic rave culture of the 1990s, thanks to its ability to trigger intense feelings of euphoria, intimacy and connection.\n\nThe drug was discovered in 1912 by a German drugmaker researching chemicals to control bleeding. A chemical cousin, MDA, became a drug of abuse in the late 1960s, producing a combination of hallucinations and intensified emotions. Users dubbed it the \u201clove drug.\u201d\n\nMDMA was largely forgotten until a handful of psychotherapists reproduced it in the late 1970s to enhance therapy sessions.\n\nDoblin first met some of the drug\u2019s proponents at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California in 1982, a seaside mecca for New Age teachers and seekers. In college at the time, Doblin became convinced of the drug\u2019s power to enhance communication and healing after an MDMA session with his girlfriend. His original plan was to become a therapist working with MDMA. But the federal government\u2019s 1985 ban on the substance pushed him into activism instead.\n\nGeorge Greer, co-founder of Heffter, was among the West Coast psychiatrists who first prescribed then-legal MDMA to treat anxiety and other issues, including domestic problems between couples. Greer and his wife, a psychiatric nurse, treated more than 80 patients with MDMA between 1980 and 1985.\n\nTHE BRAIN ON ECSTASY\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear how MDMA works, but Greer and others point to its effects on two key brain chemicals: It boosts the feel-good chemical serotonin, similar to antidepressants, and also increases the stimulating brain chemical dopamine, like amphetamines. The effect, Greer says, is that patients feel less fear and more motivation to face their traumatic memories.\n\nThe current standard of care for PTSD includes antidepressants and several forms of therapy. But only about a third of patients recover after treatment.\n\nIn studies funded by MAPS, more than 50 percent of patients who completed MDMA-assisted therapy no longer had PTSD, compared with 23 percent of patients who received therapy with either a dummy pill or inactive dose of MDMA, depending on the study.\n\nPROCESSING THE PAST\n\nNigel McCourry, a lance corporal in the Marines, returned from Iraq in 2004 beset by nightmares of ambushes, exploding mortars and gun battles. For years he suffered insomnia, sometimes standing at his apartment door convinced that someone might break in and kill him.\n\nHe was especially haunted by one incident in which he accidentally shot and killed two young girls who were riding in a truck that approached his platoon during a firefight.\n\n\u201cA lot of what was tearing me up was having this viewpoint that I was a monster and dangerous,\u201d McCourry says. \u201cOn MDMA, I was able to forgive myself in a way that felt meaningful.\u201d\n\nAfter MDMA treatment, McCourry was able to sleep through the night and stop taking antidepressants and anti-anxiety pills.\n\nBut MDMA has its own risks. When abused as a party drug it can cause life-threatening dehydration. And heavy, long-term users have shown signs of problems with memory and thinking.\n\nStill, leading psychiatrists are cautiously supportive of MAPS\u2019 research, noting the need for new treatments. More than 800,000 U.S. veterans receive disability for PTSD and the risk of suicide among veterans is 22 percent higher than other adults.\n\nTufts University psychiatrist Paul Summergrad says he wants to see larger, more rigorous trials to confirm the benefits of MDMA and psilocybin.\n\nDoblin says part of MAPS\u2019 mission is \u201charm reduction\u201d to help people use psychedelics safely.\n\nIn August, MAPS flew several staffers out to Burning Man, the Black Rock Desert festival that attracts up to 70,000 people each year, including many who use hallucinogenic drugs.\n\nDoblin and his staff trained festival volunteers who counseled 380 attendees through what they call \u201cpsychedelic crises,\u201d or bad trips.\n\nThese days, Doblin says he only occasionally uses MDMA for \u201ctherapeutic purposes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t go to raves and dance all night \u2014 although I certainly did,\u201d he says.\n\n___\n\nFollow Matthew Perrone at @AP_FDAwriter .\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

They were released in 2014 in exchange for captured U.S. Army Sgt.

It came following Khalilzad\u2019s trip to Pakistan last month, his first as a new peace envoy.\n\nBaradar was reportedly arrested after seeking to start peace talks with Karzai without Pakistan\u2019s involvement. In the interview, Karzai accused both the U.S. and Pakistan of foiling talks with Baradar at the time. He also said he made repeated attempts to gain Baradar\u2019s release, but his efforts were thwarted by both the U.S. and Pakistan.\n\nKarzai\u2019s final term in power was marked by a prickly relationship with the United States. He bitterly criticized Washington for steamrolling ahead with development plans, without consulting Afghans, who often found projects unusable or impossible to maintain. He openly fought with the U.S. military over tactics, like night-time raids that infuriated Afghans, secret prisons and the use of drones, saying it strengthened the Taliban and weakened his government.\n\nKarzai said he still has reservations about Washington\u2019s intentions as it seeks to find a negotiated exit to 17 years of war, but welcomed Khalilzad in the role of peace maker.\n\n\u201cI believe he has all the right tools to conduct this if he is given freedom by the U.S. government to act toward peace and peace building in Afghanistan,\u201d he said.\n\nKarzai has a history with Khalilzad, who was U.S. President George Bush\u2019s special envoy to Afghanistan following the 2001 collapse of the Taliban-ruled government. Khalilzad, who later served as the U.S. ambassador, was a strong proponent of Karzai for president of the first post-Taliban government.\n\nStill, Karzai told The AP that Afghans are watching this latest peace initiative.\n\nAn opponent of direct U.S. talks with the Taliban when he was Afghanistan\u2019s president, Karzai now sees it as a necessity because the Taliban today control large swaths of the country.

(Jason Lee/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nBEIJING (AP) \u2014 China and America are \u201ccompetitors but not adversaries,\u201d U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander told Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday, despite a spiraling trade war and other tensions that have pushed relations to their lowest point in years.\n\nThe upbeat message at their meeting in Beijing came amid concerns that the U.S.-China trade dispute will drag on, hurting company profits and the overall U.S. economy. Tensions have also arisen over China\u2019s claims to Taiwan and the South China Sea, allegations of Chinese theft of commercial secrets and accusations of meddling in American politics.\n\nComing a week ahead of the U.S. midterm elections, the visit by Alexander at the head of a seven-member delegation of Republican senators and congress members seemed all the more extraordinary. All are strong supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products and threatened much more.\n\n\u201cYour country and our country are competitors but not adversaries and we believe that with mutual respect we can continue to prosper together,\u201d Alexander said. While he said the delegation wished to discuss trade, he offered no specifics in opening remarks before reporters were ushered from the room.\n\nIn his comments, Li said he hoped the U.S. will meet China halfway to \u201chave the wisdom to overcome the obstacles and move our relationship forward on an even sounder track.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis not only benefits our two countries, but also benefits the entire world,\u201d Li said.\n\nAlong with criticizing China\u2019s large trade surplus with the U.S., Trump has targeted China\u2019s efforts to transform itself into a global leader in robotics, artificial intelligence and other technology industries.\n\nAmerican officials worry that might erode U.S. industrial leadership, and the U.S., Europe and other trading partners say Beijing\u2019s tactics violate its market-opening obligations.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs of up to 25 percent are part of an effort to pressure Beijing to roll back those plans, sparking a Chinese backlash. China has struck back with duties on soybeans and pork, affecting farmers in the Midwest, a region that supported the president in his 2016 campaign.\n\nOther aspects of Trump\u2019s tariff tactics have elicited concern even from within his own party.

Six businesses and a home were destroyed. Barr was killed in the blast and several other emergency workers were hurt.\n\nInvestigators filed the search warrant request July 19 and asked that a judge seal it to keep their progress a secret, stating that they\u2019re looking for evidence that would bolster a second-degree reckless homicide charge. Judge Shelley Gaylord agreed to seal the documents until Oct. 17.\n\nAn affidavit accompanying the warrant request states that an employee with Indiana-based USIC, a company that specializes in protecting utility infrastructure during excavations, failed to correctly mark the gas line in the street and instead targeted a spot beneath a sidewalk 25 feet (7.5 meters) away.\n\nThe company refused to identify the worker short of a court order.

Morrisey said such deaths in the state doubled when Manchin was governor from 2004 to 2010.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to attack this opioid epidemic,\u201d Morrisey said. \u201cThe reality is, when you heard from me, you can count on what I say. Senator Manchin, you can\u2019t trust anything he says.\u201d\n\nManchin repeated criticism of Morrisey joining 19 other states in a federal lawsuit that seeks to overturn former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, including popular insurance protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. Morrisey said he had no intention of getting rid of those protections.\n\nManchin replied, \u201cIf you drop your lawsuit, we\u2019re good.\u201d\n\nA moderator asked Manchin why he waited until the last minute to decide to support Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. Manchin quickly pointed out he was the only Democrat to support Kavanaugh. \u201cThe vote is the vote \u2014 nothing\u2019s going to change,\u201d Manchin said.\n\nMorrisey jumped on the chance to say that Manchin \u201ctook a powder in the bathroom\u201d and enabled Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to cast the deciding vote.\n\nMorrisey said he supports Republican-sponsored tax cuts to stimulate the state\u2019s economy, while Manchin said he voted against Trump\u2019s cuts because of spiraling debt and inflation worries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve written checks our children will never cash,\u201d Manchin said.\n\nThe candidates also sparred over immigration and a proposed constitutional amendment to allow lawmakers to restrict or ban taxpayer-funded abortions. Morrisey said he supports the amendment, while Manchin is against it because it does not include exceptions to save the life of the mother and in cases of rape or incest.\n\nRepublicans view the election as a chance to flip a U.S. Senate seat that Manchin has held since 2010.

The last time the same player led the Scarlet Knights in those two categories was Brian Leonard in 2003 (213 carries, 53 receptions). ... Wisconsin\u2019s Paul Chryst, with a win over Rutgers, would become the third coach in modern Big Ten history to win 40 games in his first four seasons at a school. The first two were Urban Meyer (50, 2012-15) and Jim Tressel (40, 2001-04), both of Ohio State. ... In the six quarters since he took over as the starter, Minnesota QB Tanner Morgan has completed 28 of 40 passes (70 percent) for 516 yards and three touchdowns and rushed six times for 33 yards and one TD. ... Illinois RB Reggie Corbin\u2019s 8.03 yards per carry ranks first in the Big Ten and second nationally. ... Michigan State would become the 27th FBS program to win 700 games if it beats Maryland. The Spartans are 699-456-44 all-time. ... The Maryland defense\u2019s 14 interceptions are tied for most in the country, with Fresno State and LSU.

This nonconference game against the third-ranked and unbeaten Irish (8-0, No. 4 CFP) is a chance for Northwestern to raise its profile and ding Notre Dame\u2019s playoff hopes. In their last meeting, in 2014, Northwestern erased an 11-point deficit late in the fourth quarter to beat the Irish 43-40 in overtime in South Bend.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nOhio State RBs J.K.

In a landmark verdict, South Korea's top court on Thursday ruled that people can legally reject mandatory military service on conscientious or religious grounds and must not be punished. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korea\u2019s top court ruled Thursday that South Korean men can legally reject their mandatory military service on conscientious or religious grounds without punishment.\n\nThe landmark ruling is expected to affect the cases of more than 930 conscientious objectors on trial. Hundreds of young South Korean men, mostly Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, are imprisoned every year for refusing to serve in the military.\n\nAll able-bodied South Korean men must serve about two years in the military under a conscription system aimed at coping with potential aggression from North Korea. The court broke with its own 2004 verdict that rejecting military service because of religious faith was illegal, saying at the time that confrontation with the North made South Korea\u2019s draft an indisputable necessity.\n\nThe ruling was great news for Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and others who call for improved individual rights and freedom of opinion in South Korea. But many conservatives are likely to criticize it, saying it inadequately considers the North Korean threat.\n\nWhen South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled in June that the government must provide alternative social service for conscientious objectors by 2019, a heated debate erupted over whether it is the proper time for such a measure because North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat remains unchanged. There are also worries that some might exploit alternative service to evade the draft.\n\nOn Thursday, the Supreme Court said it quashed a lower court\u2019s sentencing of a conscientious objector to 18 months in prison. It said it ordered the lower court to review its earlier verdict. Supreme Court officials said there is little chance the lower court would not abide by the decision.\n\nThe majority opinion of a panel of Supreme Court judges is that \u201cconscientious objection of military duty ... can be a valid reason\u201d to avoid military service, the top court said in a statement.\n\n\u201cForcing a military duty ... with criminal punishment or other punitive measures is an excessive restraint of freedom of conscience,\u201d the majority opinion read. \u201cFree democracy can have its legitimacy when it tolerates and embraces minorities though it is run by the principle of majority rule.\u201d\n\nSupreme Court officials said lower courts are not officially required to make the same ruling when they handle other cases of conscientious objections, but they are widely expected to do so.\n\nSince the 1950-53 Korean War, South Korea has sent about 19,350 Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses to prison for refusing to serve in the military. In recent years, about 500-600 Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses went to prison every year and spent 18 months behind bars on average. According to the group and the Supreme Court, Thursday\u2019s ruling won\u2019t apply to 96 Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses currently in prison.\n\nThe South Korean office of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses hailed the ruling as a \u201chistoric verdict that will be remembered for a long time for showing the matureness of the country\u2019s human rights awareness.\u201d\n\nThe conscientious objector whose case triggered the ruling, Oh Seung-hun, told reporters that he also hopes for \u201cpositive rulings\u201d on the 930 pending cases involving fellow Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\n\n\u201cThis verdict was possible thanks to the patience of my predecessors and colleagues totaling some 20,000 people,\u201d Oh said, according to Yonhap news agency. Oh, who hadn\u2019t been sent to prison, said he would try an alternative form of civil service.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry has yet to come up with details on alternative service.

(Justin Fountain via AP)\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 When Nicole Fountain was on the staff for MetLife Stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands, planning events was among her main duties.\n\nFountain worked with such artists as Bruce Springsteen, Kenny Chesney and Taylor Swift, who staged concerts in the building. She organized major events and oversaw social media for the stadium while running media relations during Giants, Jets and college football games and international soccer matches.\n\nThen she had an idea that has morphed into something special: Touch of Football, a fundraiser for the Crohn\u2019s & Colitis Foundation.\n\n\u201cI had joined forces with the foundation\u2019s local chapter in New Jersey,\u201d says Fountain, who suffers from the inflammatory bowel disease. \u201cI was about to do a half-marathon with the foundation and was asking about all the things they put on. I was always looking to host new events, and perhaps bring more awareness to the foundation and fundraising.\n\n\u201cI had the idea to put on a charity football tournament in the stadium.\u201d\n\nThe Giants and Jets were interested in helping, and in 2011 the event debuted. More than $100,000 was raised.\n\n\u201cA ton of teams wanted to not only have the experience of taking the field during the NFL season on the same turf as their favorite players on the Jets and Giants,\u201d Fountain explains, \u201cbut there were all these people who knew someone that had the disease who didn\u2019t realize anything was being done on a local level.\n\n\u201cSo we started doing it annually at the stadium.\u201d\n\nSoon, four other NFL stadiums were hosting Touch of Football games, in Seattle, Denver, Minneapolis and Foxborough, Massachusetts. By the end of 2018, the Touch of Football events are projected to have raised $2.7 million.\n\nOn Sunday, the eighth annual New Jersey tournament will take place at MetLife Stadium and is projected to raise nearly $115,000.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that more than 3 million people in the United States have Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis. The Crohn\u2019s & Colitis Foundation is the largest nonprofit, voluntary, health organization dedicated to finding cures for the diseases and to improve the quality of life of children and adults who are affected by these diseases.\n\nThe Foundation works to fulfill its mission by funding research; providing educational resources for patients and their families, medical professionals, and the public; and furnishing supportive services for those afflicted.\n\nThere are 38 chapters of the Crohn\u2019s & Colitis Foundation in the nation.\n\nAmong those afflicted are such athletes and former pros as Larry Nance Jr., David Garrard and Matt Light.\n\n\u201cEighty cents of what we raise per dollar goes to mission activity including research,\u201d says Jeanine Kober, the foundation\u2019s communications manager. \u201cWe have programs and support to help with the quality of life, and every person\u2019s journey is unique and different. We have local education and coaching as well as online, and health centers. We offer quite a bit in terms of support to our patients.\u201d\n\nThe foundation holds more than 100 events annually ranging from galas and luncheons to golf tournaments and fishing tournaments.\n\nThe touch football games at the NFL stadiums are particularly popular and even bring out local celebrities.\n\nIn Seattle, Pro Football Hall of Famer Walter Jones, one of the most popular players the Seahawks have had, attended the 2017 event and then fielded a team this year that included former Seahawk Cliff Avril. Lawyer Milloy, Spencer Hawes, and Pearl Jam\u2019s Mike McCready have attended.\n\n\u201cWhen the foundation books the stadium for that day, they get all the digital outlets to help promote sponsors of their event,\u201d Fountain says. \u201cWe do a lot of sponsor outreach for the tournament. It\u2019s expensive to put on these events, so to offset that we bring in sponsors.\n\n\u201cIn New Jersey, we\u2019re fortunate to have support from the Giants and Jets. The Giants are a presenting sponsor and helping to offset costs. The Jets donated a package of tickets to help with our fundraising efforts.

It allows us to use our IQs,\u201d Brogdon added. \u201cIt helps us make scoring cuts to shoot a lot of 3s and to shoot a lot of good, easy shots.\u201d\n\nEveryone is being asked to shoot the 3 \u2014 even center John Henson . He is 5 of 13 from behind the arc this season after going just 1 of 13 combined in his first six seasons in Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to take contested tough shots,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re open, for the most part, we want you to shoot it ... but we can\u2019t forget to keep driving, creating rotations and helps, things like that.\u201d\n\nThe Bucks should have Antetokounmpo back against the Celtics after he was cleared to return to practice Wednesday.

Other Hoosiers who made at least 12 starts last season include De\u2019Ron Davis, Devonte Green and Zach McRoberts. Indiana adds Saint Mary\u2019s graduate transfer Evan Fitzner.\n\nNo. 23 LSU\n\n2017-18 record: 18-15 (8-10 Southeastern Conference, lost in second round of NIT)\n\nTremont Waters is back for his sophomore season after averaging 15.9 points and 6 assists last season. He is joined in the backcourt by Skylar Mays, who had 11.3 points per game last season. LSU added a signing class that was ranked fourth in the nation according to the 247Sports Composite . LSU\u2019s freshman class includes three top-35 national recruits in forwards Naz Reid and Emmitt Williams plus guard Ja\u2019Vonte Smart.\n\nMARQUETTE\n\n2017-18 record: 21-14 (9-9 Big East), NIT quarterfinalist\n\nMarquette returns four starters from last year\u2019s team . That list includes Markus Howard, who scored 20.4 points per game last season and earned second-team all-Big East honors. Sam Hauser averaged 14.1 points and shot 48.7 percent from 3-point range last season. Marquette\u2019s other returning starters are Sacar Anim and Matt Heldt. The Golden Eagles also add Fordham graduate transfer Joseph Chartouny and Nebraska transfer Ed Morrow. Chartouny averaged 3.34 steals to lead all Division I players last season.\n\nNo. 18 MISSISSIPPI STATE\n\n2017-18 record: 25-12 (9-9 SEC), NIT semifinalist\n\nMississippi State returns its top six scorers from last season and is ranked for the first time since February 2012. The Bulldogs\u2019 list of returners includes senior guard Quinndary Weatherspoon, who averaged 14.4 points last season and was a second-team all-SEC pick by the leagues\u2019 coaches. Other notable returners include Aric Holman (10.9 ppg last year), Nick Weatherspoon (10.8), Lamar Peters (9.6), Tyson Carter (8.9) and Abdul Ado (7.8). The Bulldogs\u2019 freshman class is led by forward Reggie Perry.\n\nNo. 14 OREGON\n\n2017-18 record: 23-13 (10-8 Pac-12), lost in second round of NIT\n\nOregon is the Pac-12 media\u2019s pick to win the conference. Payton Pritchard returns after leading the Ducks in scoring (14.5) and assists (4.8) last season. Oregon also added the nation\u2019s No. 3 signing class according to the 247Sports Composite . The class is headlined by 7-foot-2 center Bol Bol, rated by the 247Sports Composite as the nation\u2019s No. 4 overall prospect in his class. Texas A&M-Corpus Christi graduate transfer Ehab Amin led all Division I players in steals (3.4) and averaged 16.9 points and 6.6 rebounds in 2016-17 before missing last season due to a hip injury.\n\nNo. 25 WASHINGTON\n\n2017-18 record: 21-13 (10-8 Pac-12), lost in second round of NIT\n\nWashington returns all five starters and its top seven scorers from last season. The Huskies have four players who had double-figure scoring averages last season: Jaylen Nowell (16.0), Noah Dickerson (15.5), David Crisp (11.6) and Matisse Thybulle (11.2). Dickerson also had a team-leading 8.4 rebounds per game last season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee", "In this Tuesday, Oct. 30, 2018 photo, workers fix damaged tires at a workshop in Gaza City. Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have coped with shortages of just about everything in more than a decade of border closures -- from chocolate to medicines to fuel and building supplies.

(AP Photo/Adel Hana)\n\nGAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) \u2014 Palestinians in Gaza have coped with shortages of just about everything in more than a decade of border closures \u2014 from chocolate to medicines to fuel and building supplies. Now, six months of protests against an Israeli-Egyptian blockade have added an unexpected item to that list: car tires.\n\nTires are a favored item by demonstrators during the weekly protests \u2014 they are set on fire, then tossed toward Israeli troops across the border.\n\nIn response, Israel has halted tire imports into the strip, sending prices skyrocketing and forcing Gaza motorists to find creative solutions to keep their vehicles on the road.\n\nTaxi driver Khaled Hamad has no spare tire in his trunk. His tires are worn down, but he could only afford to change two, replacing them with secondhand ones that aren\u2019t even the standard size recommended by the manufacturer.\n\n\u201cEven when they were cheaper, upgrading my tires was expensive,\u201d Hamad said as he kicked a bald front tire that still needs to be changed. \u201cI make 40 shekels ($11) a day these days. Business is down.\u201d\n\nProtesters at the border marches burn old tires, using the thick black smoke to obscure the vision of Israeli snipers as they hurl rocks, firebombs and grenades toward Israeli forces on the other side of the fence diving Gaza and Israel. Flaming tires are also rolled toward the fence.\n\nIronically, the tire ban has had no effect on the protesters, who rely on a seemingly endless supply of old ones that are discarded in garages, fields and roadsides across the territory.\n\nRushdi al-Khour, head of the association of Gaza spare parts merchants, which coordinates imports from Israel, said the tire shortage has caused severe losses for businessmen.\n\nHe said the cost of a pair of tires has jumped from $120 to $300 since the ban went into effect, a sizable sum in the economically struggling strip.\n\nFifteen distributors have lost up to $2 million so far, both in tires they bought from Israeli companies and in storage fees for shipments stuck at Israeli ports, according to al-Khour.\n\n\u201cThis is a wrong decision by the Israeli side,\u201d he said of the ban. \u201cLift the siege and the protests will stop.\u201d\n\nThe Hamas-led protests have been fueled by widespread despair over the difficult conditions created by the blockade. Unemployment is now over 50 percent, and Gazans get just a few hours of electricity a day.\n\nIsrael and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza after Hamas, a militant group that opposes Israel\u2019s existence, took control of the territory in 2007. Israel says the blockade, which restricts the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza, is necessary to isolate Hamas.\n\nAfter coping with shortages of basic items for over a decade, Gazans have become adept at finding creative solutions.\n\nIn the attic of a small workshop in the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza Strip, Abdulla al-Radie invented a rubbery filling for old motor scooter tires that he says extend their lifespan.\n\nHe recently changed the name of his shop to \u201cAirless Tires Workshop\u201d and began selling tires he claims cannot be punctured. To demonstrate, he plunged a knife and nails into a tire. He refused to say what the filling is made from, but said it involves five materials, including plastic and rubber.\n\nAt first, the fillings were produced in pipes, but they affected the balance of the wheels. He says he has improved his creation to make \u201cround molds that fit the shape of the tire and sustain weight.\u201d\n\nAbout 50 tires were stacked at his shop on a recent day, and he said he sold twice that amount in September. He is now opening a new branch in the southern town of Rafah, where many residents have motorbikes.\n\n\u201cToday we started with motorcycles,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope next we will make them for cars.\u201d\n\nFadi Diab, who owns a tire store and repair workshop, said he paid about $20,000 to store nine containers of tires stranded at an Israeli port.\n\n\u201cThe prices have gone up and people don\u2019t have money,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople come here when changing the tires is their last option. They want to use the tires as long as possible.\u201d\n\nSome businessmen managed to bring in three shipments of tires from Egypt in October, Diab said. That brought some temporary relief, he said, but sales remain low.\n\nOnly three new tires were seen stacked on a shelf in his shop, while dozens of gleaming metal wheels adorned the wall.\n\n\u201cOnly those who rely on their cars for income ... replace their tires these days,\u201d Diab added.\n\nHamad, the taxi driver, said he\u2019d change his tires only when prices come down. \u201cI\u2019m afraid these old tires will keep flattening and affecting my work by delaying me from my customers.\u201d", "FILE - In this Tuesday, April 25, 2006 file photo, a group of migrants cross the desert between Sasabe, Mexico, and Sasabe, Ariz. As people worldwide flee war, hunger and a lack of jobs, global migration has soared to record highs, with more than 258 million international migrants in 2017. That is an increase of 49 percent from the turn of the century, according to the United Nations. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 The brothers-in-law knew all too well that crossing the desert leading to the United States could be lethal. One had lost a father on the journey in 1995 and an uncle in 2004. And the two young men had already tried to make the trek just a few months before but surrendered to border patrol agents in exhaustion.\n\nYet Juan Lorenzo Luna and Armando Reyes set off again in August 2016 from their small northern Mexico town of Gomez Palacio.\n\nOf the five who left Gomez Palacio together, two men made it to safety, and one turned back. The only information he gave was that the brothers-in-law had stopped walking and planned to surrender again. That is the last that is known of them.\n\nAs people worldwide flee war, hunger and a lack of jobs, global migration has soared to record highs, with more than 258 million international migrants in 2017. Far less visible, however, has been the toll of this mass migration \u2014 the tens of thousands of people who die or simply disappear during their journeys, never to be seen again.\n\nIn most cases, nobody is keeping track: Barely counted in life, these people don\u2019t register in death, as if they never lived at all.\n\nAt least 3,861 migrants are dead and missing on the route from Mexico to the United States since 2014, the AP found. The AP\u2019s tally includes records from the Colibri Center for Human Rights on the U.S. side and the Argentine Forensic Anthropology team in Mexico, as well as numbers from the U.N.\u2019s International Organization for Migration and U.S. Border Patrol.\n\nThe painstaking work of identification can take years, hampered by a lack of resources, official records and coordination between countries \u2014 and even between states. The political tide has also turned against migrants, dead or alive, with the U.S. government cracking down severely on caravans of Central Americans making their way to its borders.\n\nIn the case of Luna and Reyes, officials told the families that they had scoured prisons and detention centers, but there was no sign of the missing men. Cesaria Orona even consulted a fortune teller about her missing son, Armando, and was told he had died in the desert.\n\nOne weekend in June 2017, volunteers found eight bodies next to a military area of the Arizona desert and posted the images online in the hopes of finding family. Maria Elena Luna came across a Facebook photo of a decaying body found in an arid landscape dotted with cactus and shrubs, lying face-up with one leg bent outward. There was something horribly familiar about the pose.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how my brother used to sleep,\u201d she whispered.\n\nAlong with the bodies, the volunteers found a credential of a boy from Guatemala, a photo and a piece of paper with a number written on it. The photo was of Juan Lorenzo Luna, and the number on the paper was for cousins of the family. But investigators warned that while a wallet or credential was a clue, it could also have been stolen, as migrants are frequently robbed.\n\n\u201cWe all cried,\u201d Maria Elena Luna recalled. \u201cBut I said, we cannot be sure until we have the DNA test. Let\u2019s wait.\u201d\n\nIn 2010 the Argentine forensic team and the local morgue in Pima County, Ariz., began to organize efforts to put names to the anonymous bodies found on both sides of the border. The initiative, the \u201cBorder Project,\u201d has gained support from institutions in the United States, Mexico and Central America, and to date has identified more than 183 people \u2014 a fraction of the total.\n\nLuna and Orona gave DNA samples to the Mexican government and the Argentine group. An initial possible match for Reyes came back negative. They are still waiting.\n\nEvery time Luna hears about clandestine graves or unidentified bodies in the news, the anguish is sharp.\n\n\u201cSuddenly all the memories come back,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not want to think.\u201d\n\nFurther south, the toll of the dead and the missing has been all but ignored from the single largest population movement in the world today \u2014 that of more than 2 million Venezuelans fleeing from their country\u2019s collapse.\n\nThese migrants have hopped buses across the borders, boarded flimsy boats in the Caribbean, and \u2014 when all else failed \u2014 walked for days along dirt roads and freezing mountain trails. Vulnerable to violence from drug cartels, hunger and illness that lingers even after they arrive, they have disappeared or died by the hundreds.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t withstand a trip that hard, because the journey is very long,\u201d said Carlos Valdes, director of neighboring Colombia\u2019s national forensic institute. \u201cAnd many times, they only eat once a day. They don\u2019t eat. And they die.\u201d\n\nThose deaths are uncounted, as are dozens in the sea. Also uncounted are those reported missing in Colombia, Peru and Ecuador. In all the AP found at least 3,410 Venezuelans have been reported missing or dead in a migration whose dangers have gone relatively unnoticed; many of the dead perished from illnesses on the rise in Venezuela that easily would have found treatment in better times.\n\nAmong the missing is Randy Javier Gutierrez, who was walking through Colombia with a cousin and his aunt in hopes of reaching Peru to reunite with his mother.\n\nGutierrez\u2019s mother, Mariela Gamboa, said that a driver offered a ride to the two women, but refused to take her son. The women agreed to wait for him at the bus station in Cali, about 160 miles (257 kilometers) ahead, but he never arrived. Messages sent to his phone since that day in June have gone unread.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very worried,\u201d his mother said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what to do.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nChristine Armario in Colombia contributed to this story.", "FILE - In this Oct. 6, 2018, file photo, Texas coach Tom Herman watches during the second half of the team's NCAA college football game against Oklahoma at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas.

The Mountaineers and Longhorns, who last met as ranked teams in their initial game as Big 12 foes in 2012, are tied with No. 7 Oklahoma atop the league standings. Texas is 3-0 this season against Top 25 teams, but coach Tom Herman\u2019s team is looking to bounce back from a loss at Oklahoma State that ended its six-game winning streak. West Virginia and quarterback Will Grier rebounded from a loss at Iowa State with a lopsided home win over Baylor last week. WVU ends its regular season against Oklahoma, which the Longhorns already beat at the State Fair of Texas.\n\nBEST MATCHUP\n\nOklahoma interim defensive coordinator Ruffin McNeill against Texas Tech and coach Kliff Kingsbury\u2019s offense. The Red Raiders average 528 total yards and 42 points a game, second only to Oklahoma in the Big 12. Since McNeill replaced fired defensive coordinator Mike Stoops, the Sooners have held TCU to 275 total yards and Kansas State to 245. McNeill was defensive coordinator at Texas Tech before going to East Carolina as head coach. Sooners coach Lincoln Riley, a Texas Tech alumnus who started his coaching career there, was on McNeill\u2019s staff at ECU. Kingsbury was a record-setting quarterback at Tech when McNeill was on the staff there.\n\nINSIDE THE NUMBERS\n\nTexas Tech leads the Big 12 with 23 rushing touchdowns, and has allowed only nine. ... Iowa State has won its last three games, all in October to improve to 7-0 in such games the past two seasons. The only other time they went undefeated in October was 1938. ... Oklahoma State and Texas Tech both need one win to get bowl eligible. Only Big 12 co-leaders Oklahoma, West Virginia and Texas already have six wins. ... Baylor WR Jalen Hurd, the former Tennessee RB, has 39 first-down receptions and 35 catches for at least 10 yards.\n\nLONG SHOT\n\nTCU has never had a four-game losing streak in coach Gary Patterson\u2019s 18 seasons as head coach. The Horned Frogs (3-5) go into Saturday\u2019s home game against Kansas State, the coach\u2019s alma mater, with three losses in a row. But they are favored by more than a touchdown against K-State, which has lost four of its last five games, including 51-14 at Oklahoma last weekend.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH\n\nKansas freshman running back Pooka Williams is the Big 12 leader with 147.7 all-purpose yards per game. When held to 33 yards rushing on 11 carries against TCU, he had seven catches for 102 yards and two touchdowns as the Jayhawks won. Williams is still fourth in the Big 12 with 93.3 yards rushing per game.\n\n___\n\nCompiled by AP Sports Writer Stephen Hawkins in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "Minnesota Timberwolves' Taj Gibson, right congratulates Derrick Rose after the Timberwolves defeated the Utah Jazz 128-125 in an NBA basketball game Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2018, in Minneapolis.

(AP) \u2014 In her election ads, Dr. Kim Schrier wears a white doctor\u2019s coat as she declares that health care is a right.\n\nShe talks about her Type 1 diabetes, her concern as a parent over President Donald Trump\u2019s policies and how she counsels families of depressed teen boys as a longtime pediatrician.\n\nThe Democrat running for an open U.S. House seat in Washington state is framing her candidacy around health care issues with a personal touch, hoping the popularity of aspects of former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law and support for improving access to medical care drives her to victory.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything radical about wanting people in this country to have health care,\u201d Schrier said at a debate with Republican opponent Dino Rossi, a longtime state lawmaker.\n\nSchrier and the Democratic Party have focused on the health law\u2019s protections for people with pre-existing conditions after the GOP failed to repeal \u201cObamacare\u201d last year.\n\nRepublicans have rolled out ads slamming her plan to expand Medicare as a \u201cscheme\u201d that \u201ccould double taxes\u201d as they try to keep the seat in the 8th District that encompasses the ultraliberal eastern Seattle suburbs to the solidly conservative rural Cascade Mountains. The seat is open because Rep. Dave Reichert is retiring.\n\nSchrier, who vows to protect Planned Parenthood and abortion rights, is one of four Democratic female doctors running for the House. The doctors who have been elected to Congress have largely been Republican men.\n\n\u201cI just think we are losing a lot of humanity in the country right now and a lot of compassion, and that\u2019s what women physicians bring,\u201d Schrier said.\n\nA recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and MTV found health care is on voters\u2019 minds and they\u2019re sympathetic to the core Democratic stance that government should be involved.\n\nThe survey says 69 percent of young Americans between 15 and 34 favor a national health plan, known as a single-payer program. Eighty-eight percent of young Democrats and 40 percent of young Republicans favor government-run health insurance, according to the poll. Roughly two-thirds of young independents are in favor.\n\nThe American Medical Association, which has supported Obama\u2019s health care law, said it doesn\u2019t track the political leanings of its membership of doctors but that the number of female doctors overall reflects recent diversity in the field.\n\n\u201cAs half of all medical school students today are women, it\u2019s no surprise that female physicians are increasingly politically active,\u201d Dr. Barbara L. McAneny, president of the group said in a statement. \u201cThe physician perspective is critical in the legislative process.\u201d\n\nThe other three female doctors running for Congress as Democrats are Hiral Tipirneni, an emergency room doctor in Arizona; Kyle Horton, a former veteran affairs system doctor in North Carolina; and Danielle Mitchell, a family physician in Tennessee.\n\nIf one of them is elected, she would be the first Democratic female doctor in Congress. Donna Christian-Christensen is a doctor who served as a non-voting delegate from the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nThe GOP Doctors Caucus didn\u2019t respond to requests seeking comment.\n\nWashington\u2019s 8th District is among the most expensive House races in the country, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. With more than $25 million pouring in, it has already doubled the previous state record.\n\nIt\u2019s one of two dozen districts nationwide held by the GOP but whose voters chose Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. It\u2019s one of the tightest midterm races and a critical potential pickup for Democrats trying to take the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time since 2010.\n\nRossi, the Republican candidate, has called Schrier a product of an anti-Trump movement who lacks leadership experience. He said he supports future efforts to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal Obama\u2019s signature health care law, suggesting instead a \u201chigh risk\u201d insurance pool for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nRossi, a 59-year-old real estate investor, paints Schrier\u2019s priority of expanding Medicare as a \u201cgovernment takeover of health care\u201d that lacks funding details.\n\n\u201cIs there some other scheme that she has to pay for this? No one\u2019s asked her,\u201d Rossi said.\n\nSchrier wants to allow the public to buy in to Medicare, which she said would pay for itself.\n\nChristina Ewig, director of the Center on Women, Gender and Public Policy at the University of Minnesota, said female doctors often work as general practitioners who bring a different empathy to the health care debate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important women doctors are running in light of the (Affordable Care Act) but there\u2019s only so much they can do\u201d alone to protect the health care law, Ewig said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Sally Ho on Twitter: https://twitter.com/_SallyHo .", "Fans cheer after Golden State Warriors forward Kevin Durant (35) scored against the New Orleans Pelicans during the first half of an NBA basketball game in Oakland, Calif., Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2018.

Details of the alleged plot have not been disclosed and Wickremesinghe denies the accusation.\n\nSirisena had replaced him with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa and suspended Parliament until Nov. 16 in an apparent attempt to give Rajapaksa time to muster enough support to survive any no-confidence vote.\n\nWickremesinghe had demanded the convening of Parliament, saying he still controls a majority of lawmakers.\n\nSirisena\u2019s moves have triggered a power struggle and some observers call it a constitutional crisis.\n\nIn remarks broadcast on state television, Rajapaksa told a meeting at his office that Sirisena decided to summon Parliament on Nov. 5.\n\nKaru Paranavithana, a lawmaker from Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Front, welcomed the announcement, calling it \u201ca great victory\u201d for the people.\n\nHe said Sirisena\u2019s coalition tried to establish a dictatorship but failed. \u201cThey will have to retreat now,\u201d he said.\n\nWickremensinghe tweeted saying \u201cthe people\u2019s voices have been heard.

A police informant has said Wickremesinghe and a Cabinet member, former army commander Sarath Fonseka, were behind it. Police have made no arrests.\n\nTensions have been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister.

On Tuesday, thousands of Sri Lankans protested in the capital demanding Sirisena immediately convene Parliament.\n\nSeparately on Thursday, Sirisena swore in two Cabinet ministers, five state ministers and six deputy ministers, as a part of the new Cabinet which is still being formed.

Bibi plans to leave the country, her family said Thursday, as Islamists mounted rallies demanding Bibi be publicly hanged. The Islamists also called for the killing of the three judges, including Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, who acquitted Bibi. (AP Photo/Fareed Khan)\n\nISLAMABAD (AP) \u2014 A Christian woman acquitted in Pakistan after eight years on death row for blasphemy plans to leave the country soon, her family said Thursday, and authorities said they arrested two prisoners last month for conspiring to kill her.\n\nRadical Islamists mounted rallies across the country for a second day after Pakistan\u2019s Supreme Court in a landmark ruling overturned the 2010 conviction against Asia Bibi for insulting Islam\u2019s Prophet Muhammad. The charge of blasphemy carries the death penalty in this majority Muslim nation.\n\nBibi\u2019s acquittal posed a challenge to the government of Pakistan\u2019s new Prime Minister Imran Khan, who came to power this summer partly by pursuing the Islamist agenda. He asked protesters not to \u201ctest the patience of the state.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the government was avoiding the use of force against demonstrators to resolve the issue peacefully.\n\nBibi remained at an undisclosed location Thursday, where the 54-year-old mother of five was being held for security reasons, awaiting her formal release, her brother James Masih told The Associated Press.\n\nMasih said his sister simply would not be safe in Pakistan.\n\n\u201cShe has no other option and she will leave the country soon,\u201d he said. Masih would not disclose the country of her destination but both France and Spain have offered asylum.\n\nAlso on Thursday, jail officials said two inmates were arrested last month at an undisclosed detention facility for planning to kill Bibi by strangling her. They said the men were still being questioned.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nA female commando who is part of a team of police and paramilitary troops deployed to protect Bibi, told The Associated Press that Bibi was reading a Bible when the news about her acquittal was conveyed to her.\n\nBibi was wearing green and orange traditional Pakistani dress and a scarf when an AP reporter saw her at the facility.\n\nAccording to the female commando, who asked to remain unidentified as she was not authorized to speak to media, Bibi upon hearing news of her release said the judges gave her a new life and she was grateful to them.\n\nOfficials said Bibi is at a safe facility but that she still fears for her life and has trouble sleeping, fearing someone might harm her.\n\nBibi\u2019s husband, Ashiq Masih, had returned from Britain with their children in mid-October and was waiting for her to join them, the brother said.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 1,000 Islamists blocked a key road linking the capital Islamabad with the garrison city of Rawalpindi on Thursday, demanding Bibi be publicly hanged. Authorities deployed paramilitary troops, signaling they could move in to clear the roads.\n\nHundreds also blocked another key motorway, linking Islamabad with major cities such as Lahore and Peshawar, chanting slogans against Bibi and demanding her execution.\n\nLater on Thursday, lawyer Ghulam Mustafa filed a petition in the Supreme Court requesting the judges review the acquittal as the government began talks with rally organizers to end their protests, which led to dozens of vehicles being torched.\n\nMeanwhile, opposition lawmakers in parliament called Thursday for reforming the judicial system and Pakistan\u2019s controversial blasphemy law \u2014 so that innocents like Bibi wouldn\u2019t spent years languishing in jail.\n\nHafiz Saeed, a radical cleric wanted by the United States, urged followers to hold rallies across Pakistan on Friday to condemn Bibi\u2019s release. Saeed is the founder of the outlawed Lashkar-e-Taiba group, which was blamed for the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people.\n\nProtesters, rallied by firebrand cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi, also set up roadblocks and burned tires in the southern port city of Karachi while hundreds clashed Thursday with police in various parts of eastern Punjab province.\n\nMany parents kept their children from school, fearing more violence.\n\nThe Islamists also called for the killing of the three judges, including Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, who acquitted Bibi.\n\nThe three are on the hit list of Rizvi\u2019s Tehreek-e-Labbaik party, which has demanded a public execution for Bibi. Rizvi has managed to turn out tens of thousands of supporters in the past, often forcing authorities to bow to his demands on religious matters.\n\nTehreek-e-Labbaik claimed Thursday that two of its supporters were killed by police fire during overnight clashes in Karachi. No government official could immediately confirm any casualties.\n\nIn his televised speech, Prime Minister Khan warned the Islamists: \u201cLet me make it very clear to you that the state will fulfill its responsibility.\u201d\n\nBibi\u2019s lawyer, Saiful Malook, has gone into hiding as the extremists had threatened his life as well.\n\nOn Wednesday, cleric Afzal Qadri, with Rizvi by his side, urged a crowd of supporters outside the Punjab provincial parliament in the city of Lahore to revolt against army chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa and overthrow Khan\u2019s government.\n\nBibi\u2019s acquittal, however, has been seen as a hopeful sign by Christians in Pakistan, where the mere rumor of blasphemy can spark lynchings. Religious minorities, who have been repeatedly targeted by extremists, fear the law because it is often used to settle scores and to pressure minorities.\n\nBibi was arrested in 2009 after she was accused of blasphemy following a quarrel with two fellow female farm workers who refused to drink from a water container used by a Christian. A few days later, a mob accused her of insulting Islam\u2019s prophet, leading to her 2010 conviction.\n\nBibi\u2019s family has always maintained her innocence and says she never insulted the prophet.\n\n___\n\nTanveer reported from Multan, Pakistan", "In this Thursday, April 12, 2018 photo, mortuary workers carry the coffin of an unidentified man for burial at a cemetery outside Johannesburg. At least five bodies of unidentified people are buried on top of each other in each grave. (AP Photo/Bram Janssen)\n\nJOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 One by one, five to a grave, the coffins are buried in the red earth of this ill-kept corner of a South African cemetery. The scrawl on the cheap wood attests to their anonymity: \u201cUnknown B/Male.\u201d\n\nThese men were migrants from elsewhere in Africa with next to nothing who sought a living in the thriving underground economy of Gauteng province, a name that roughly translates to \u201cland of gold.\u201d Instead of fortune, many found death, their bodies unnamed and unclaimed \u2014 more than 4,300 in Gauteng between 2014 and 2017 alone.\n\nSome of those lives ended here at the Olifantsvlei cemetery, in silence, among tufts of grass growing over tiny placards that read: Pauper Block. There are coffins so tiny that they could belong only to children.\n\nAs migration worldwide soars to record highs, far less visible has been its toll: The tens of thousands of people who die or simply disappear during their journeys, never to be seen again. In most cases, nobody is keeping track. Barely counted in life, these people don\u2019t register in death , as if they never lived at all.\n\nA growing number of migrants have drowned, died in deserts or fallen prey to traffickers, leaving their families to wonder what happened to them. At the same time, anonymous bodies are filling cemeteries, including in South Africa. (Nov. 1)\n\nAn Associated Press tally has documented at least 56,800 migrants dead or missing worldwide since 2014 \u2014 almost double the number found in the world\u2019s only official attempt to try to count them, by the U.N.\u2019s International Organization for Migration. The IOM toll as of Oct. 1 was more than 28,500. The AP came up with almost 28,300 additional dead or missing migrants by compiling information from other international groups, requesting forensic records, missing persons reports and death records, and sifting through data from thousands of interviews with migrants.\n\nThe deaths and disappearances are the result of migration that is up 49 percent since the turn of the century, with more than 258 million international migrants in 2017, according to the United Nations. A growing number have drowned, died in deserts or fallen prey to traffickers, leaving their families to wonder what on earth happened to them. At the same time, anonymous bodies are filling cemeteries around the world, like the one in Gauteng.\n\nThe AP\u2019s tally is still low. More bodies of migrants lie undiscovered in desert sands or at the bottom of the sea. And families don\u2019t always report loved ones as missing because they migrated illegally, or because they left home without saying exactly where they were headed.\n\nThe official U.N. toll focuses mostly on Europe, but even there cases fall through the cracks. The political tide is turning against migrants in Europe just as in the United States, where the government is cracking down heavily on caravans of Central Americans trying to get in . One result is that money is drying up for projects to track migration and its costs.\n\nFor example, when more than 800 people died in an April 2015 shipwreck off the coast of Italy, Europe\u2019s deadliest migrant sea disaster, Italian investigators pledged to identify them and find their families. More than three years later, under a new populist government, funding for this work is being cut off.\n\nBeyond Europe, information is even more scarce. Little is known about the dead and missing in South America, where the Venezuelan migration is among the world\u2019s biggest today, and in Asia, the top region for numbers of migrants.\n\nThe result is that governments vastly underestimate the toll of migration, a major political and social issue in most of the world today.\n\n\u201cNo matter where you stand on the whole migration management debate....these are still human beings on the move,\u201d said Bram Frouws, the head of the Mixed Migration Centre , based in Geneva, which has done surveys of more than 20,000 migrants in its 4Mi project since 2014. \u201cWhether it\u2019s refugees or people moving for jobs, they are human beings.\u201d\n\nThey leave behind families caught between hope and mourning, like that of Safi al-Bahri. Her son, Majdi Barhoumi, left their hometown of Ras Jebel, Tunisia, on May 7, 2011, headed for Europe in a small boat with a dozen other migrants. The boat sank and Barhoumi hasn\u2019t been heard from since. In a sign of faith that he is still alive, his parents built an animal pen with a brood of hens, a few cows and a dog to stand watch until he returns.\n\n\u201cI just wait for him. I always imagine him behind me, at home, in the market, everywhere,\u201d said al-Bahari. \u201cWhen I hear a voice at night, I think he\u2019s come back. When I hear the sound of a motorcycle, I think my son is back.\u201d\n\n_______________________\n\nEUROPE: BOATS THAT NEVER ARRIVE\n\nOf the world\u2019s migration crises, Europe\u2019s has been the most cruelly visible. Images of the lifeless body of a Kurdish toddler on a beach, frozen tent camps in Eastern Europe, and a nearly numbing succession of deadly shipwrecks have been transmitted around the world, adding to the furor over migration.\n\nIn the Mediterranean, scores of tankers, cargo boats, cruise ships and military vessels tower over tiny, crowded rafts powered by an outboard motor for a one-way trip. Even larger boats carrying hundreds of migrants may go down when soft breezes turn into battering winds and thrashing waves further from shore.\n\nTwo shipwrecks and the deaths of at least 368 people off the coast of Italy in October 2013 prompted the IOM\u2019s research into migrant deaths. The organization has focused on deaths in the Mediterranean, although its researchers plead for more data from elsewhere in the world. This year alone, the IOM has found more than 1,700 deaths in the waters that divide Africa and Europe.\n\nA look at migration in the Mediterranean and North Africa. (AP Video/Bram Janssen, Medi Arem, Nariman El-Mofty, Nat Casta\u00f1eda)\n\nLike the lost Tunisians of Ras Jebel, most of them set off to look for work. Barhoumi, his friends, cousins and other would-be migrants camped in the seaside brush the night before their departure, listening to the crash of the waves that ultimately would sink their raft.\n\nKhalid Arfaoui had planned to be among them. When the group knocked at his door, it wasn\u2019t fear that held him back, but a lack of cash. Everyone needed to chip in to pay for the boat, gas and supplies, and he was short about $100. So he sat inside and watched as they left for the beachside campsite where even today locals spend the night before embarking to Europe.\n\nPropelled by a feeble outboard motor and overburdened with its passengers, the rubber raft flipped, possibly after grazing rocks below the surface on an uninhabited island just offshore. Two bodies were retrieved. The lone survivor was found clinging to debris eight hours later.\n\nThe Tunisian government has never tallied its missing, and the group never made it close enough to Europe to catch the attention of authorities there. So these migrants never have been counted among the dead and missing.\n\n\u201cIf I had gone with them, I\u2019d be lost like the others,\u201d Arfaoui said recently, standing on the rocky shoreline with a group of friends, all of whom vaguely planned to leave for Europe. \u201cIf I get the chance, I\u2019ll do it. Even if I fear the sea and I know I might die, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nWith him that day was 30-year-old Mounir Aguida, who had already made the trip once, drifting for 19 hours after the boat engine cut out. In late August this year, he crammed into another raft with seven friends, feeling the waves slam the flimsy bow. At the last minute he and another young man jumped out.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right,\u201d Aguida said.\n\nThere has been no word from the other six \u2014 yet another group of Ras Jebel\u2019s youth lost to the sea. With no shipwreck reported, no survivors to rescue and no bodies to identify, the six young men are not counted in any toll.\n\nIn addition to watching its own youth flee, Tunisia and to a lesser degree neighboring Algeria are transit points for other Africans north bound for Europe. Tunisia has its own cemetery for unidentified migrants, as do Greece, Italy and Turkey. The one at Tunisia\u2019s southern coast is tended by an unemployed sailor named Chamseddin Marzouk.\n\nOf around 400 bodies interred in the coastal graveyard since it opened in 2005, only one has ever been identified. As for the others who lie beneath piles of dirt, Marzouk couldn\u2019t imagine how their families would ever learn their fate.\n\n\u201cTheir families may think that the person is still alive, or that he\u2019ll return one day to visit,\u201d Marzouk said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know that those they await are buried here, in Zarzis, Tunisia.\u201d\n\n______\n\nAFRICA: VANISHING WITHOUT A TRACE\n\nA look at the challenges migrants face as they navigate the Sahara Desert. (AP Video/Bram Janssen, Nat Casta\u00f1eda)\n\nDespite talk of the \u2018waves\u2019 of African migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean, as many migrate within Africa \u2014 16 million \u2014 as leave for Europe. In all, since 2014, at least 18,400 African migrants have died traveling within Africa, according to the figures compiled from AP and IOM records. That includes more than 4,300 unidentified bodies in a single South African province, and 8,700 whose traveling companions reported their disappearance en route out of the Horn of Africa in interviews with 4Mi.\n\nWhen people vanish while migrating in Africa, it is often without a trace. The IOM says the Sahara Desert may well have killed more migrants than the Mediterranean. But no one will ever know for sure in a region where borders are little more than lines drawn on maps and no government is searching an expanse as large as the continental United States. The harsh sun and swirling desert sands quickly decompose and bury bodies of migrants, so that even when they turn up, they are usually impossible to identify .\n\nWith a prosperous economy and stable government, South Africa draws more migrants than any other country in Africa. The government is a meticulous collector of fingerprints \u2014 nearly every legal resident and citizen has a file somewhere \u2014 so bodies without any records are assumed to have been living and working in the country illegally. The corpses are fingerprinted when possible, but there is no regular DNA collection.\n\nSouth Africa also has one of the world\u2019s highest rates of violent crime and police are more focused on solving domestic cases than identifying migrants.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s logic to that, as sad as it is....You want to find the killer if you\u2019re a policeman, because the killer could kill more people,\u201d said Jeanine Vellema, the chief specialist of the province\u2019s eight mortuaries. Migrant identification, meanwhile, is largely an issue for foreign families \u2014 and poor ones at that.\n\nVellema has tried to patch into the police missing persons system, to build a system of electronic mortuary records and to establish a protocol where a DNA sample is taken from every set of remains that arrive at the morgue. She sighs: \u201cResources.\u201d It\u2019s a word that comes up 10 times in a half-hour conversation.\n\nSo the bodies end up at Olifantsvlei or a cemetery like it, in unnamed graves. On a recent visit by AP, a series of open rectangles awaited the bodies of the unidentified and unclaimed. They did not wait long: a pickup truck drove up, piled with about 10 coffins, five per grave. There were at least 180 grave markers for the anonymous dead, with multiple bodies in each grave.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross, which is working with Vellema, has started a pilot project with one Gauteng morgue to take detailed photos, fingerprints, dental information and DNA samples of unidentified bodies. That information goes to a database where, in theory, the bodies can be traced.\n\n\u201cEvery person has a right to their dignity. And to their identity,\u201d said Stephen Fonseca, the ICRC regional forensic manager.\n\n____________\n\nTHE UNITED STATES: \u201cTHAT\u2019S HOW MY BROTHER USED TO SLEEP\u201d\n\nMore than 6,000 miles (9,000 kilometers) away, in the deserts that straddle the U.S.-Mexico border, lie the bodies of migrants who perished trying to cross land as unforgiving as the waters of the Mediterranean. Many fled the violence and poverty of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador or Mexico. Some are found months or years later as mere skeletons. Others make a last, desperate phone call and are never heard from again.\n\nIn 2010 the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team and the local morgue in Pima County, Ariz., began to organize efforts to put names to the anonymous bodies found on both sides of the border. The \u201cBorder Project\u201d has since identified more than 183 people \u2014 a fraction of the total.\n\nAt least 3,861 migrants are dead and missing on the route from Mexico to the United States since 2014, according to the combined AP and IOM total. The tally includes missing person reports from the Colibri Center for Human Rights on the U.S. side as well as the Argentine group\u2019s data from the Mexican side. The painstaking work of identification can take years, hampered by a lack of resources, official records and coordination between countries \u2014 and even between states.\n\nFor many families of the missing, it is their only hope, but for the families of Juan Lorenzo Luna and Armando Reyes, that hope is fading.\n\nLuna, 27, and Reyes, 22, were brothers-in-law who left their small northern Mexico town of Gomez Palacio in August 2016. They had tried to cross to the U.S. four months earlier, but surrendered to border patrol agents in exhaustion and were deported.\n\nThey knew they were risking their lives \u2014 Reyes\u2019 father died migrating in 1995, and an uncle went missing in 2004. But Luna, a quiet family man, wanted to make enough money to buy a pickup truck and then return to his wife and two children. Reyes wanted a job where he wouldn\u2019t get his shoes dirty and could give his newborn daughter a better life.\n\nOf the five who left Gomez Palacio together, two men made it to safety, and one man turned back. The only information he gave was that the brothers-in-law had stopped walking and planned to turn themselves in again. That is the last that is known of them.\n\nOfficials told their families that they had scoured prisons and detention centers, but there was no sign of the missing men. Cesaria Orona even consulted a fortune teller about her missing son, Armando, and was told he had died in the desert.\n\nOne weekend in June 2017, volunteers found eight bodies next to a military area of the Arizona desert and posted the images online in the hopes of finding family. Maria Elena Luna came across a Facebook photo of a decaying body found in an arid landscape dotted with cactus and shrubs, lying face-up with one leg bent outward. There was something horribly familiar about the pose.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how my brother used to sleep,\u201d she whispered.\n\nAlong with the bodies, the volunteers found a credential of a boy from Guatemala, a photo and a piece of paper with a number written on it. The photo was of Juan Lorenzo Luna, and the number on the paper was for cousins of the family. But investigators warned that a wallet or credential could have been stolen, as migrants are frequently robbed.\n\n\u201cWe all cried,\u201d Luna recalled. \u201cBut I said, we cannot be sure until we have the DNA test. Let\u2019s wait.\u201d\n\nLuna and Orona gave DNA samples to the Mexican government and the Argentine group. In November 2017, Orona received a letter from the Mexican government saying that there was the possibility of a match for Armando with some bone remains found in Nuevo Leon, a state that borders Texas. But the test was negative.\n\nThe women are still waiting for results from the Argentine pathologists. Until then, their relatives remain among the uncounted.\n\nOrona holds out hope that the men may be locked up, or held by \u201cbad people.\u201d Every time Luna hears about clandestine graves or unidentified bodies in the news, the anguish is sharp.\n\n\u201cSuddenly all the memories come back,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not want to think.\u201d\n\n________\n\nSOUTH AMERICA: \u201cNO ONE WANTS TO ADMIT THIS IS A REALITY\u201d\n\nThe toll of the dead and the missing has been all but ignored in one of the largest population movements in the world today \u2014 that of nearly 2 million Venezuelans fleeing from their country\u2019s collapse. These migrants have hopped buses across the borders, boarded flimsy boats in the Caribbean, and \u2014 when all else failed \u2014 walked for days along scorching highways and freezing mountain trails. Vulnerable to violence from drug cartels, hunger and illness that lingers even after reaching their destination, they have disappeared or died by the hundreds.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t withstand a trip that hard, because the journey is very long,\u201d said Carlos Valdes, director of neighboring Colombia\u2019s national forensic institute. \u201cAnd many times, they only eat once a day. They don\u2019t eat. And they die.\u201d Valdes said authorities don\u2019t always recover the bodies of those who die, as some migrants who have entered the country illegally are afraid to seek help.\n\nValdes believes hypothermia has killed some as they trek through the mountain tundra region, but he had no idea how many. One migrant told the AP he saw a family burying someone wrapped in a white blanket with red flowers along the frigid journey.\n\nMarta Duque, 55, has had a front seat to the Venezuela migration crisis from her home in Pamplona, Colombia. She opens her doors nightly to provide shelter for families with young children. Pamplona is one of the last cities migrants reach before venturing up a frigid mountain paramo, one of the most dangerous parts of the trip for migrants traveling by foot. Temperatures dip well below freezing.\n\nShe said inaction from authorities has forced citizens like her to step in.\n\n\u201cEveryone just seems to pass the ball,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one wants to admit this is a reality.\u201d\n\nThose deaths are uncounted, as are dozens in the sea. Also uncounted are those reported missing in Colombia, Peru and Ecuador. In all at least 3,410 Venezuelans have been reported missing or dead in a migration within Latin America whose dangers have gone relatively unnoticed; many of the dead perished from illnesses on the rise in Venezuela that easily would have found treatment in better times.\n\nAmong the missing is Randy Javier Gutierrez, who was walking through Colombia with a cousin and his aunt in hopes of reaching Peru to reunite with his mother.\n\nGutierrez\u2019s mother, Mariela Gamboa, said that a driver offered a ride to the two women, but refused to take her son. The women agreed to wait for him at the bus station in Cali, about 160 miles (257 kilometers) ahead, but he never arrived. Messages sent to his phone since that day four months ago have gone unread.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very worried,\u201d his mother said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what to do.\u201d\n\n___________\n\nASIA: A VAST UNKNOWN\n\nThe region with the largest overall migration, Asia, also has the least information on the fate of those who disappear after leaving their homelands. Governments are unwilling or unable to account for citizens who leave for elsewhere in the region or in the Mideast, two of the most common destinations, although there\u2019s a growing push to do so.\n\nAsians make up 40 percent of the world\u2019s migrants, and more than half of them never leave the region. The Associated Press was able to document more than 8,200 migrants who disappeared or died after leaving home in Asia and the Mideast, including thousands in the Philippines and Indonesia.\n\nThirteen of the top 20 migration pathways from Asia take place within the region. These include Indian workers heading to the United Arab Emirates, Bangladeshis heading to India, Rohingya Muslims escaping persecution in Myanmar, and Afghans crossing the nearest border to escape war. But with large-scale smuggling and trafficking of labor, and violent displacements, the low numbers of dead and missing indicate not safe travel but rather a vast unknown.\n\nAlmass was just 14 when his widowed mother reluctantly sent him and his 11-year-old brother from their home in Khost, Afghanistan, into that unknown. The payment for their trip was supposed to get them away from the Taliban and all the way to Germany via a chain of smugglers. The pair crammed first into a pickup with around 40 people, walked for a few days at the border, crammed into a car, waited a bit in Tehran, and walked a few more days.\n\nHis brother Murtaza was exhausted by the time they reached the Iran-Turkey border. But the smuggler said it wasn\u2019t the time to rest \u2014 there were at least two border posts nearby and the risk that children far younger travelling with them would make noise.\n\nAlmass was carrying a baby in his arms and holding his brother\u2019s hand when they heard the shout of Iranian guards. Bullets whistled past as he tumbled head over heels into a ravine and lost consciousness.\n\nAlone all that day and the next, Almass stumbled upon three other boys in the ravine who had also become separated from the group, then another four. No one had seen his brother. And although the younger boy had his ID, it had been up to Almass to memorize the crucial contact information for the smuggler.\n\nWhen Almass eventually called home, from Turkey, he couldn\u2019t bear to tell his mother what had happened. He said Murtaza couldn\u2019t come to the phone but sent his love.\n\nThat was in early 2014. Almass, who is now 18, hasn\u2019t spoken to his family since.\n\nAlmass said he searched for his brother among the 2,773 children reported to the Red Cross as missing en route to Europe. He also looked for himself among the 2,097 adults reported missing by children. They weren\u2019t on the list.\n\nWith one of the world\u2019s longest-running exoduses, Afghans face particular dangers in bordering countries that are neither safe nor welcoming. Over a period of 10 months from June 2017 to April 2018, 4Mi carried out a total of 962 interviews with Afghan migrants and refugees in their native languages around the world, systematically asking a series of questions about the specific dangers they had faced and what they had witnessed.\n\nA total of 247 migrant deaths were witnessed by the interviewed migrants, who reported seeing people killed in violence from security forces or starving to death. The effort is the first time any organization has successfully captured the perils facing Afghans in transit to destinations in Asia and Europe.\n\nAlmass made it from Asia to Europe and speaks halting French now to the woman who has given him a home in a drafty 400-year-old farmhouse in France\u2019s Limousin region. But his family is lost to him. Their phone number in Afghanistan no longer works, their village is overrun with Taliban, and he has no idea how to find them \u2014 or the child whose hand slipped from his grasp four years ago.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know now where they are,\u201d he said, his face anguished, as he sat on a sun-dappled bench. \u201cThey also don\u2019t know where I am.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nHinnant reported from Ras Jebel, Tunisia, along with Mehdi El Arem.

Jewish law mandates that the burial take place as soon as possible.\n\nBut the scale of the violence wreaked by a gunman Saturday has placed an extraordinary responsibility on those dedicated to this work, all volunteers. The victims included one of their own, Jerry Rabinowitz, a doctor who had worked with the group in the past to prepare bodies for burial.\n\nRecovering and preparing a body for burial are traditionally done by the local chapter of the burial society called Chevra Kadisha, led in Pittsburgh by an Orthodox rabbi, Daniel Wasserman. He works alongside Admon, who, as a member of Israel-based Zaka International, spent many years in his home country recovering bodies at the scenes of accidents and terrorist attacks.\n\nAll those volunteering earn their living doing other jobs. In addition to Wasserman and Admon, who teaches at a local religious school, the group at the Tree of Life included a doctor, a house painter and a paramedic.\n\nTheir work began hours after Saturday\u2019s attack. Late that night, the FBI allowed Wasserman and Admon inside the synagogue. The men drew themselves a map, showing the precise spot where each of the victims was killed. Then they spent most of the night accompanying the bodies as they were removed to the medical examiner\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth, Saturday night was very tough. I came home and I just started crying,\u201d said Admon, choking back tears.\n\n(Nov. 1)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to a lot of scenes, but these are people you know very well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very hard to see, like, people coming on a Saturday morning to a peaceful place ... to get a connection with God and the same moment they got a connection with God, an evil person came and in and said, \u2018Guys, just because you\u2019re Jewish, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe task of recovering remains, he said, is best undertaken with a minimum of thinking, and a focus on the work itself. FBI agents went to great lengths to accommodate the volunteers, bringing additional lighting into the room they were working in on Tuesday and providing safety clothing and other equipment, Admon said.\n\nAs the investigation continued all around them, the volunteers finished removing remains from one room Tuesday but will be going back as allowed by the FBI.\n\nMost of the funerals will be over before the volunteers can complete their work. That means that the remnants recovered from the synagogue will probably not be placed in the victims\u2019 caskets. They will instead be buried separately at the cemetery, with markers listing the names of the dead.\n\nFor the volunteers, it provides the satisfaction of performing a crucial task. In the end, Jewish law will be fulfilled. But just as important, Admon said, recovering all traces of victims and making them whole will \u201cgive these people the respect they need, because it\u2019s the minimum we can do.\u201d", "YUMA, Ariz.

(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 Fans of U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren may have long fantasized about a face-to-face debate between the liberal firebrand and her nemesis, President Donald Trump.\n\nThis campaign, they\u2019ve gotten the next best thing as the Massachusetts Democrat has worked to fend off a challenge by Republican Geoff Diehl, a state representative and co-chair of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign in the state.\n\nAlthough Warren is ahead in the polls and fundraising, some see in the sparring match a test run for a possible real-life clash between Warren and Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThere are a lot of hurdles that Warren \u2014 who has said she would take a hard look after the November election at a run for president \u2014 would have to clear on the way to that scenario. She has yet to say definitively that she is running for president, and there are plenty of other Democrats in the hypothetical mix, making Warren\u2019s path to her party\u2019s nomination anything but certain.\n\nBut the midterm election has given Warren a chance to dust off her campaign chops. In televised debates, Warren has gone after Diehl hard. The Republican has responded by painting Warren as out of touch with Massachusetts voters.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Associated Press, Warren wasted little time connecting Diehl to Trump, who remains unpopular in Massachusetts, where he garnered less than 34 percent of the 2016 vote.\n\n\u201cMy opponent has said he\u2019s with Donald Trump 100 percent of the time,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThat means he\u2019s with Donald Trump in wanting to be the deciding vote to roll back health care for tens of millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nDiehl said that while he supports Trump \u2014 he noted the unemployment rate in Massachusetts has dropped during the past two years \u2014 he doesn\u2019t agree with every Trump-backed policy. He said he opposed the proposed elimination of state and local tax deductions in the GOP tax reform bill.\n\nDiehl has also shied away from calling Warren \u201cPocahontas,\u201d a favorite Trump taunt and a reference to Warren\u2019s claims of Native American heritage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never made it an issue with this campaign,\u201d Diehl told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that\u2019s been attached to her since 2012. We\u2019ll see if the public believes what she\u2019s saying.\u201d\n\nWarren in October released DNA test results that provide some evidence of a Native American in her lineage. The test has done little to quell criticism of her by Trump and his supporters.\n\nAsked whether the release of the DNA test accomplished what she\u2019d hoped, Warren said her goal is to be an open book.\n\n\u201cThis is just who I am. I put it all out there. Ten years of tax returns. All my employment records. And yeah, I even took a DNA test. It\u2019s there. It\u2019s on the internet. Anybody can take a look at it,\u201d she said.\n\nJeffrey Berry, a professor of American politics and political behavior at Tufts University, said Warren is already looking past Diehl as she weighs a possible White House run, noting her travels to other states to campaign with \u2014 and raise money for \u2014 fellow Democrats.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be two lanes that quickly emerge after November,\u201d Berry said. \u201cOne is the very liberal lane and one is the even more liberal lane.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to be in the even more liberal lane and will face candidates like Kamala Harris, while more moderate voices like Kirsten Gillibrand and Deval Patrick will be in the conventional liberal lane,\u201d he said, referring to the senators from California and New York and the former governor of Massachusetts. All three have been mentioned as possible Democratic presidential hopefuls.\n\nDespite her national profile and occasional Twitter feuds with Trump, Warren says that for her, politics is a means to an end \u2014 helping to reverse what she calls the \u201chollowing out of the middle class\u201d in America.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get into politics for any reason other than to try to help working families. This has been my life\u2019s work,\u201d said Warren, who worked as a law professor at Harvard before running for the Senate in 2012. \u201cThis is not something I adopted because somebody said it polled well.\u201d\n\nFor Diehl, Warren\u2019s political ambitions have robbed Massachusetts of a full-time advocate in the Senate. He has said that if Warren wants to be president, she should quit her re-election campaign.\n\nDiehl has also argued he can offer Massachusetts something Warren can\u2019t \u2014 a seat at the table in the GOP-controlled Senate and Republican White House. It\u2019s an argument he has made by invoking the late Democratic senator Edward Kennedy.\n\n\u201cTed Kennedy was the liberal lion of the Senate, but when the elections were over, he would work with Republican presidents or Republican governors here in Massachusetts to deliver for the people,\u201d Diehl said. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening with Sen. Warren.\u201d\n\nAlthough she points to some legislative successes under the Trump administration, Warren said her goal is to help flip the Senate to make it easier for Democrats to push a more ambitious agenda in line with the goals of most Massachusetts voters.\n\nTo make that happen, Warren said, she needs as many allies as possible in Congress.\n\n\u201cThe best way that I can serve the people of Massachusetts is not only to vote in their interest but also to try to get some allies who will do the same,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI want to win these fights.\u201d\n\nAsked about the worst thing Trump has done during his two years in office, Warren points to what she describes as his embrace of authoritarian figures like Russian President Vladimir Putin or North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un.\n\n\u201cWhen he talks about his love for Kim Jong Un, a brutal, repressive dictator in North Korea and engages in photo ops with him and basically gets nothing in return, I am deeply shocked and I\u2019m left to wonder what\u2019s happening here?\u201d Warren said.\n\nIndependent candidate Shiva Ayyadurai is also on the ballot.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "HONOLULU (AP) \u2014 Honolulu officials will allow $44 million from the city\u2019s general fund to be used to finance the city\u2019s 20-mile (32-kilometer) rail project.\n\nThe Honolulu City Council approved measures Tuesday that were needed to meet the demands of the Federal Transit Authority for the more than $8 billion project, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported .\n\nCity officials told council members that the administration is examining financing options that are transparent, do not put the city in financial risk and get the funds into a Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transit account by the federal agency\u2019s Nov. 20 deadline.\n\nThe FTA had demanded for the city come up with $44 million to help fund administrative costs for the project, setting a Nov. 20 deadline to submit details as part of a project recovery plan.\n\nThe FTA had committed $1.55 billion for the rail project, but held up about $745 million pending a new recovery plan, which the agency required when project costs soared from the $5.26 billion number given several years ago.\n\nAn option for financing would be a short-term commercial-paper form of borrowing, which would be the \u201cleast invasive,\u201d said Gary Kurokawa, Mayor Kirk Caldwell\u2019s chief of staff.

The death of notorious Boston mobster James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger marks the third inmate to be killed at a West Virginia federal prison in the last six months. (Don Treeger /The Republican via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Long before notorious Boston mobster James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger was killed at a federal prison in West Virginia, lawmakers, advocates and even prison guards had been sounding the alarm about dangerous conditions there. But there has been no public indication that federal prison officials have taken action to address the safety concerns, even as Bulger\u2019s killing marks the third at the facility in the last six months.\n\nAn independent government commission found that United States Penitentiary Hazelton has been overcrowded for years. Inmates have repeatedly expressed concerns about their safety at the high-security prison, which houses 1,270 male inmates. A 2016 report from the District of Columbia\u2019s Corrections Information Council said that prisoners warned officials, \u201cInmates can lose their lives quickly here.\u201d\n\nIn April, 48-year-old Ian Thorne was killed during an altercation with a fellow prisoner, and in September, Demario Porter was also killed in another fight with a fellow inmate.\n\nCourt records, oversight reports and news articles detail numerous violent incidents in recent years. In 2016, an inmate was charged with murder after prosecutors said he strangled another prisoner to death during a fight. In February 2015, an inmate stabbed a fellow prisoner with a hand-crafted weapon during a fight, according to court documents. Another inmate received an extended sentence in May for assaulting a fellow prisoner and possessing a deadly weapon.\n\n\u201cThere are a multitude of federal prisons that don\u2019t have a homicide rate like that,\u201d said Cameron Lindsay, a former federal prison warden who now works as a jail security consultant.\n\nThe federal Bureau of Prisons declined to make Acting Director Hugh Hurwitz available for an interview, but said in a statement that a team of \u201csubject-matter experts\u201d has been sent to the prison to \u201cto assess operational activities and correctional security practices and measures to determine any relevant facts that may have contributed to the incident.\u201d\n\nLast week, five members of Congress wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions about what they called \u201cdangerous continual understaffing\u201d at federal prisons in West Virginia and Pennsylvania and stated their alarm about the deaths at USP Hazelton.\n\nJustice Department spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle said DOJ was \u201caware of the concerns raised in the letter\u201d and would respond to the members of Congress.\n\nIn a separate letter this month, the District of Columbia\u2019s House delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, asked the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general to launch an investigation into the conditions at USP Hazelton, citing Thorne and Porter\u2019s deaths. Holmes Norton said she had also heard about the \u201cbrutal treatment\u201d of inmates at the prison and was concerned that the incidents \u201cmay be indicative of larger, ongoing problems at the facility.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Norton said Bulger\u2019s death \u201cunderscores reports of a culture of violence at Hazelton.\u201d\n\nNorton\u2019s office said she had not received a response to her earlier letter, and John Lavinsky, a spokesman for the inspector general, declined to comment.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons said its team that has been sent to the prison will report their findings to the agency\u2019s leadership. The agency didn\u2019t immediately respond to follow-up questions about whether those recommendations would be made public.\n\nThe 89-year-old Bulger, who benefited from a corrupt relationship with the FBI before spending 16 years as one of America\u2019s most wanted men, was found unresponsive Tuesday morning, just hours after he arrived at USP Hazelton. He was declared dead shortly afterward. Authorities have not released a cause of death, but prosecutors said it was being investigated as a homicide. A Mafia hit man, Fotios \u201cFreddy\u201d Geas, who is said to hate \u201crats,\u201d and at least one other inmate are believed to have been involved in Bulger\u2019s killing, an ex-investigator briefed on the case said Wednesday. The longtime investigator was not authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nBulger led a largely Irish mob that ran loan-sharking, gambling and drug rackets. He also was an FBI informant who ratted on the New England mob, his gang\u2019s main rival, in an era when bringing down the Mafia was a top priority for the FBI.\n\nA federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that Bulger had been transferred to the prison where he was killed because he had disciplinary problems at a Florida prison where he had been serving a life sentence. The official has been briefed on the investigation into Bulger\u2019s killing and insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to release details.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is why the Federal Bureau of Prisons would transfer a super high-publicity inmate, who is a known snitch, to general population of a high-security prison. You\u2019ve got to be smarter than that,\u201d Lindsay, the former warden, said.\n\nUnion officials say the prison is operating at about 75 percent of its staffing level and has dozens of vacant positions. They have also decried a practice known as augmentation, which taps health care workers, teachers, secretaries and prison cooks to fill correction officer positions because of officer shortages and overtime limits.\n\nJustin Tarovisky, executive vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 420, which represents Hazelton prison guards, said Bulger\u2019s death \u201coutlines how dangerous this prison is.\u201d The union voiced its concerns about staffing in a picket outside the prison as far back as 2015.\n\nThe letter sent to Sessions last week by Sens.

(AP Photo/Mae Anderson)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Carrying signs that included a mocking use of the company\u2019s original \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d motto, thousands of Google employees around the world briefly walked off the job Thursday to protest what they said was the tech giant\u2019s mishandling of sexual misconduct allegations against executives.\n\nFrom Tokyo, Singapore and London to New York, Seattle and San Francisco, highly paid engineers and other workers staged walkouts of about an hour, reflecting rising #MeToo-era frustration among women over frat-house behavior and other misconduct in heavily male Silicon Valley.\n\nIn Dublin, organizers used megaphones to address the outdoor crowd of men and women, while in other places, workers gathered in packed conference rooms or lobbies. In New York, there appeared to be as many men as women out in the streets, while in Cambridge, Massachusetts, men outnumbered women by perhaps 6 to 1.\n\n\u201cTime is up on sexual harassment!\u201d organizer Vicki Tardif Holland shouted, her voice hoarse, at a gathering of about 300 people in Cambridge. \u201cTime is up on systemic racism. Time is up on abuses of power. Enough is enough!\u201d\n\nAbout 1,000 Google workers in San Francisco swarmed into a plaza in front of the city\u2019s historic Ferry Building, chanting, \u201cWomen\u2019s rights are workers\u2019 rights!\u201d Thousands turned out at Google\u2019s Mountain View, California, headquarters.\n\nWorkers in Google's Mountain View campus joined their colleagues from the world in walking out to protest the tech company's mishandling of sexual misconduct allegations against executives (Nov. 1)\n\nThe demonstrations reflected a sense among some of the 94,000 employees at Google and its parent Alphabet Inc. that the company isn\u2019t living up to its professed ideals, as expressed in its \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d slogan and its newer injunction in its corporate code of conduct : \u201cDo the right thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have the eyes of many companies looking at us,\u201d Google employee Tanuja Gupta said in New York. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been a vanguard company, so if we don\u2019t lead the way, nobody else will.\u201d\n\nThe protests unfolded a week after The New York Times detailed allegations of sexual misconduct about the creator of Google\u2019s Android software, Andy Rubin. The newspaper said Rubin received a $90 million severance package in 2014 after Google concluded the accusations were credible. Rubin has denied the allegations.\n\nThe same story also disclosed allegations of sexual misconduct against other executives, including Richard DeVaul, a director at the Google-affiliated lab that created self-driving cars and internet-beaming balloons. DeVaul had remained at the \u201cX\u2033 lab after the accusations surfaced a few years ago, but resigned on Tuesday without severance, Google said.\n\nIn an unsigned statement, the Google protesters called for an end to forced arbitration in harassment and discrimination cases, a practice that requires employees to give up their right to sue and often includes confidentiality agreements.\n\nBesides being angry about what they contend has been lenient handling of executives who mistreat women, the protest organizers demanded more aggressive steps for gender pay equity and more inclusive hiring practices to reduce the high concentration of white and Asian men in the industry\u2019s best-paying programming jobs.\n\nWomen account for 31 percent of Google\u2019s employees worldwide, and it\u2019s lower for leadership roles. The numbers are similar elsewhere in Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cI have seen friends get hurt and have their careers destroyed by this, not just at Google but everywhere,\u201d protester J.J. Wanda, a male software engineer, said in Mountain View. \u201cWe need to show that time\u2019s up.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is reviewing all the \u201cconstructive ideas\u201d from employees to improve policies and practices.\n\nBeyond Google, Facebook has faced criticism over pay inequity and discrimination. The appearance of a Facebook executive behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings also caused rifts inside the company.\n\nAs Thursday dawned, organizers had predicted about 1,500 employees would participate in the walkouts, mostly women. But the numbers appeared to exceed that, based on media accounts and images posted on the protest\u2019s Twitter account.\n\nThe protests at Google are the latest sign that frustrations among women are reaching a boiling point, said Stephanie Creary, a professor who specializes in workplace and diversity issues at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School.\n\n\u201cPeople simply aren\u2019t willing to put up with it anymore,\u201d Creary said. \u201cThe workers at Google seem to be saying, \u2018How is it that we are still having to have this conversation?\u2019\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s CEO assured employees earlier this week that the company would support them in their protest. He also apologized for Google\u2019s \u201cpast actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand the anger and disappointment that many of you feel,\u201d Pichai said in an email. \u201cI feel it as well, and I am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our society ... and, yes, here at Google, too.\u201d\n\nPichai last week sought to assure employees that the company had cracked down on misconduct, saying it had fired 48 employees, including 13 senior managers, for sexual harassment in recent years without giving any of them severance packages.\n\nIn recent months, Google and other Silicon Valley companies have also been plagued by dissension over other corporate policies, customer privacy and what some employees regard as misuses of technology.\n\nMore than 1,000 Google employees signed a letter protesting the company\u2019s plan to build a search engine that would comply with Chinese censorship rules.\n\nAnd thousands signed a petitio asking Google to cancel an artificial-intelligence protect to help the Pentagon improve the targeting of drone strikes. Google later said it won\u2019t renew the contract, according to published reports, and opted not to bid for another military contract that could be worth $10 billion.\n\n___\n\nAP Technology Writers Mae Anderson in New York, Matt O\u2019Brien in Providence, Rhode Island, and Frank Bajak in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and AP videojournalists Joe Frederick in New York and Haven Daley in Mountain View, California, contributed to this report.", "JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) \u2014 The state is offering safe drinking water to households in a southeast Alaska town after a toxic substance was discovered in groundwater.\n\nA dozen private wells in Gustavus qualified to receive shipped-in jugs of water from the state following the discovery of a chemical compound known as PFAS, Alaska\u2019s Energy Desk reported Wednesday.\n\nThe substance is found in foam used to suppress oil fires.

(Kirsty O'Connor/Pool via AP)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 The Bank of England warned Thursday that Britain could suffer an economic shock if it crashes out of the European Union without a deal, saying it could cause gridlock at ports and an inflation-rearing fall in the pound that could require higher interest rates.\n\nAfter the bank decided to keep its main rate at 0.75 percent, Governor Mark Carney said the British economy\u2019s supply capacity \u2014 that is, what the country is able to produce \u2014 could \u201cfall sharply\u201d in case of a disorderly Brexit.\n\n\u201cAn abrupt and disorderly withdrawal could result in delays at borders, disruptions to supply chains, and more rapid and costly shifts in patterns of production, severely impairing the productive capacity of some U.K. businesses,\u201d he said.\n\nCarney said policymakers would have to try to work out which of the changes were short-term \u2014 caused by logistical challenges related to the end of free movement of goods and services, for example \u2014 and which would affect the economy in the longer-term.\n\nThe bank could be forced to raise interest rates, depending on how the pound reacts, he said. After Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016, the currency fell 15 percent against major currencies, stoking inflation by making imports more expensive.\n\nThe bank, which is tasked with keeping inflation stable, is predicting another fall in the pound if Britain leaves the EU without a deal and no transition to smoothen out the exit.\n\n\u201cThere are scenarios where policy would have to be tightened,\u201d Carney told a news conference, while adding that a no-deal Brexit is \u201cnot the most likely scenario.\u201d\n\nMany economists doubt the central bank\u2019s initial response to a disorderly Brexit would be to increase rates. After the 2016 referendum, when the pound had fallen, the bank cut rates.\n\nThe Bank of England, which has raised its key rate twice over the past year, is more likely to slash its benchmark rate to zero, economists say. And it could add stimulus by buying corporate bonds.\n\nCarney\u2019s comments come as Prime Minister Theresa May struggles to keep her divided Conservative Party in check in the Brexit discussions.\n\nThe talks are hung up in particular on the question of how to avoid reinstating a hard between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.\n\nA summit of EU leaders in October was supposed to be the moment by which to reach a Brexit deal. Now officials are talking about a summit in December as the last chance for a deal. By then, many Britain-based firms may have already activated contingency plans that could include transferring business to the continent and cutting jobs.\n\nMay\u2019s proposal for a Brexit deal is to essentially keep Britain in the European single market for goods, which would avoid tariffs and help keep supply chains operating without delays.\n\nThough households have weathered the uncertainty and continued to spend thanks to an increase in wages, the uncertainty has hit business investment. In a survey, the Bank of England found that more than 50 percent of firms identified Brexit as being one of the top three sources of uncertainty in September and October, up around 10 percentage points from August.\n\nThe bank said there has been little evidence of significant precautionary stock-building ahead of Brexit, though it said it\u2019s possible that could occur over the rest of this year and early next if concerns about Brexit persist. If the Brexit transition goes smoothly, the central bank is predicting a pick-up in business investment next year.\n\nThat would help growth rise to around 1.75 percent a year on average over the coming three years. Under this scenario, interest rates would rise by a quarter percentage point per year over the period.\n\nBut, echoing comments by the Treasury chief this week, Carney said the bank would have to revisit its forecasts in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cThe economic outlook depends significantly on the nature of EU withdrawal, in particular the form of new trading arrangements between the EU and U.K. and whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth and how households, businesses and financial markets respond,\u201d he said.", "KLAMATH FALLS, Ore.

Stacey Abrams waves at a campaign event in Atlanta. Over the course of a year, Stacey Abrams has transformed from a technocratic leader in the Georgia legislature into a nationally known symbol of the Democratic Party\u2019s future. (AP Photo/John Bazemore, File)\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ga. (AP) \u2014 If Stacey Abrams becomes America\u2019s first black female governor on Tuesday, former President Jimmy Carter and Oprah Winfrey could be the keys to her success.\n\nHer ability to win over a 94-year-old white man with deep ties to the rural South and one of the world\u2019s most famous black women who rarely dabbles in campaign-style politics highlights Abrams\u2019 strategy to win the Georgia governor\u2019s mansion. She\u2019s betting that charm, unabashed liberalism and her roots can motivate a coalition of black voters, liberal whites in the city and enough white voters elsewhere to overcome persistent Deep South divisions over race, culture and politics.\n\nIt\u2019s a tall order for a state that hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat as governor since 1998.\n\nThe balancing act will be on display in the coming days. Winfrey will campaign Thursday with Abrams, appearing in both a Democratic stronghold and a Republican-leaning suburb, an itinerary befitting someone who built her empire with a cross-section of fans. Former President Barack Obama will campaign for Abrams Friday at historically black Morehouse College.\n\nFor her part, Abrams is pitching her agenda, particularly Medicaid expansion and public education, to the full electorate, including rural white voters often overlooked by Democrats in previous campaigns.\n\nThose close to Abrams say she and her campaign are keenly aware of the challenge.\n\n\u201cThe South really is changing,\u201d Abrams\u2019 mother, the Rev. Carolyn Abrams, said in an interview. \u201cBlack candidates, especially black women, are being taken seriously.\u201d\n\nBut the elder Abrams struck a cautious note. For her daughter to win, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take the people who populate all the state of Georgia, not just whites, not just blacks, not just Latinos, but right-thinking people coming together.\u201d\n\nPolls show a tight campaign between Abrams, a former state legislative leader, and her Republican opponent, Brian Kemp, the current secretary of state. Republicans control state politics, but their winning margins in recent elections hasn\u2019t been nearly as wide as in other Deep South states. President Donald Trump won Georgia by 5 percentage points; outgoing Gov. Nathan Deal topped out at 53 percent of the vote.\n\nIf no one emerges with more than 50 percent of the vote next week, a runoff will be held in December.\n\nThe campaign has been overshadowed by race in its final weeks. Abrams has blasted Kemp\u2019s performance as the state\u2019s chief elections officer, joining voting rights advocates in accusing him of using his post to make it harder for citizens, particularly minorities, to vote. Kemp maintains he\u2019s merely following federal and state election laws.\n\nAbrams, meanwhile, found herself on defense after a photo resurfaced of her participating in a 1992 protest in which the Georgia flag was burned. At the time, the flag contained the Confederate symbol. During a debate with Kemp, Abrams said she \u201ctook an action of peaceful protest\u201d and noted that Kemp himself voted as a legislator to strip the state flag of its Old South insignia.\n\nStill, the dynamics in Georgia contrast to neighboring Florida, where Democrat Andrew Gillum could become the state\u2019s first black governor. Trump recently tweeted without evidence that Gillum was a \u201cthief.\u201d And at a recent debate, Gillum noted his GOP opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, was backed by an activist who once used a racial epithet in describing Obama.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cI\u2019m simply saying the racists believe he\u2019s a racist.\u201d\n\nAbrams has been more circumspect when discussing race and the historic nature of her potential victory.\n\n\u201cI look forward to making history,\u201d she\u2019ll say in some national media interviews.\n\nShe extols her parents, both ordained Methodist clergy, and details her father\u2019s challenges as a \u201cblack man in Mississippi\u201d once dismissed as \u201cjust another problem\u201d because of his dyslexia. She tells of being invited to the Georgia governor\u2019s mansion as her high school\u2019s valedictorian, only to have a security guard initially deny her and her parents entry after they stepped off a transit bus at the gates of the estate. \u201cHe never asked for the invitation my mother had in her purse,\u201d Abrams says.\n\nIn recent weeks, Abrams began incorporating into her campaign speech a scene she witnessed in tiny Seminole County in southwest Georgia\u2019s wiregrass territory. She recalled watching two elementary school boys help each other use a water fountain neither of them was tall enough to reach alone. Deep into her telling, she mentioned that one boy was white and the other was African-American. Then she hit her crescendo.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have to argue about who got to be first in line. ... They didn\u2019t argue about whether there\u2019d be enough,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cThey knew instinctively that if they worked together, they would both be made full, they\u2019d both be made whole.\u201d\n\nHer paid advertising features the gamut of Georgia\u2019s 10 million-plus residents, but perhaps most notably includes a white worker who tells voters in a distinct south Georgia accent that Abrams \u201cfights everyday\u201d for \u201cguys like me.\u201d\n\nAbrams knows she won\u2019t get every vote \u2014 or many votes at all \u2014 among older whites who long ago abandoned the Democratic Party, people like Dr. Robert Williams and Ken Kline, two veterans in the north Georgia town of Rome who describe themselves as \u201cbig Trump fans.\u201d\n\nWilliams, an 83-year-old retired Air Force surgeon, listens to Abrams\u2019 proposals and hears a would-be governor who \u201cjust wants to make everything free.\u201d\n\nKline, a Navy Seabee during the Vietnam War, expresses alarm over Abrams\u2019 support for taking down Confederate monuments from state property \u2014 a position that Abrams does not make part of her central pitch.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get to have a heritage,\u201d the 71-year-old Kline says.\n\nEven with their criticisms, Williams and Kline implicitly grasp the strategy.\n\n\u201cSome of the young people seem to be for her,\u201d Williams said.\n\nJoel Huff may be one of them. A 43-year-old white man who lives in Athens and travels the state working on solar energy projects, Huff said he doesn\u2019t vote in some elections.\n\nBut after happening upon an Abrams\u2019 campaign stop alongside Carter, the former president, Huff asked Abrams about her energy ideas and said he \u201cabsolutely loved\u201d her answer about investing more in solar both for economic and environmental benefits.\n\nBlack politicians have succeeded in previous statewide Georgia elections, though never as governor. Thurbert Baker won three terms as attorney general after first being appointed to the post. Michael Thurmond was elected to three terms as state labor commissioner after first winning a legislative seat in a majority white district. Rep. Sanford Bishop currently represents a majority white congressional district anchored in Columbus.\n\nBishop and Thurmond, now the executive of DeKalb County in metro Atlanta, say Abrams is already meeting the first task: asking for votes everywhere.\n\nEconomic arguments, Bishop said, transcend race, because \u201ceveryone wants a better life.\u201d Thurmond, who lost his initial bids for elected office, adds that as a black politician \u201cyou should not let your own fears about who might or might not vote for you get in the way ... because you never know what is in someone\u2019s heart.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics\n\n___\n\nFollow Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP .\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the surname is DeSantis, not De Santis.", "2 Oregon women sentenced in neglect of more than 80 horses\n\nFILE--In this March 26, 2018, file photo, a neglected horse lies in a barn stall while awaiting care from a farrier, at the Deschutes County Livestock Rescue and Shelter in Bend, Ore.

(AP) \u2014 In a rousing speech in the Republican-leaning suburbs of Atlanta, Oprah Winfrey urged voters on Thursday to make history by backing Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams in next week\u2019s election.\n\nWinfrey called Abrams a \u201cchangemaker\u201d who represents the values of all Georgians.\n\n\u201cI am here today because Stacey Abrams cares about the things that matter,\u201d she said to a mostly female audience north of downtown Atlanta.\n\nSeventy-five miles (120 kilometers) north, Vice President Mike Pence stood alongside Abrams\u2019 opponent, Brian Kemp, in Dalton, and mocked the billionaire media icon who grew up in Mississippi as just another liberal outsider trying to impose on Republican-run Georgia.\n\n\u201cStacey Abrams is being bankrolled by Hollywood liberals,\u201d Pence said.\n\nPence drew boos from the crowd when he mentioned that \u201cOprah is in town\u201d and noted that actor Will Ferrell was recently in Georgia for Democrats.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to remind Stacey and Oprah and Will Ferrell, I\u2019m kind of a big deal, too,\u201d Pence said, adding \u201ca message for all Stacey Abrams\u2019 liberal Hollywood friends: This ain\u2019t Hollywood. This is Georgia.\u201d\n\nThe competing scenes \u2014 from the candidates, to the audiences, to the headliner guests \u2014 underscore the choice Georgia voters face Tuesday in one of the nation\u2019s premier midterm matchups. After Thursday\u2019s dueling outsiders, former President Barack Obama will follow on Friday for Abrams. President Donald Trump will appear with Kemp on Sunday and previewed his argument on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked Oprah,\u201d he told reporters at the White House. \u201cOprah\u2019s good, but the woman that she\u2019s supporting is not qualified to be the governor of Georgia by any stretch of the imagination.\u201d Trump did not detail why he found Abrams unqualified.\n\nMore than 1.5 million of the state\u2019s almost 7 million registered voters have cast ballots already.\n\nAbrams, a Yale-educated lawyer who served a decade in the Georgia Legislature, would be the first black female governor in American history. She\u2019s sought the post as an unapologetic liberal trying to draw new voters to the polls and prove that Georgia\u2019s growth and diversity make it a legitimate two-party battleground.\n\nShe touts her experience working with Republicans as a state legislative leader, but she doesn\u2019t back down on her promises to expand Medicaid insurance, prioritize public education and push for tighter gun restrictions.\n\nKemp is a staunch conservative who has embraced Trump and the administration\u2019s hard-line on immigration. He wields guns in his ads and lambastes Abrams as a tool of \u201csocialists\u201d and \u201cbillionaires\u201d who \u201cwant to turn Georgia into California.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates have taken to describing the race as a battle for \u201cthe soul of our state.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Winfrey sought to cut through the party-line framing.\n\nThe entertainment icon, who rarely makes political endorsements, drew cheers when she said she\u2019s a registered independent who was not in Georgia at anyone\u2019s request.\n\n\u201cI paid to come here myself, and I approved this message,\u201d Winfrey said, explaining that she tracked down Abrams\u2019 cellphone number and called her to say she wanted to offer assistance in the final days of the campaign.\n\nShe added a note to the throng of media gathered for the event, urging against any reboot of recent speculation that she might run for president in 2020.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here because I\u2019m making some grandstand for myself. I don\u2019t want to run. I\u2019m not testing the waters,\u201d she said.\n\nTouting the Democratic nominee\u2019s pitch for Medicaid expansion, \u201ccommon-sense gun control,\u201d environmental regulations and \u201ckeeping families together, Winfrey said Abrams offers \u201cthe values that matter to Georgians all over this state.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocracy is not just about our individual rights and concerns and our individual protections,\u201d Winfrey said, \u201cbut rather it lives and thrives in making sure that everybody is lifted by the community.\u201d\n\nWinfrey did not mention Pence or the frequent GOP broadsides about \u201cHollywood\u201d outsiders. But after her speech, in a sit-down interview with Abrams \u2014 reminiscent of the 25-year television run of her daytime television show \u2014 she noted they were \u201cjust two women from Mississippi,\u201d where Abrams spent most of her childhood before moving to Georgia.\n\nAs a black woman, Winfrey noted her kinship to two groups historically denied ballot access in the United States. She recalled generations of black Americans who faced \u201clynching ... oppression ... suppression,\u201d and declared that \u201ctheir blood has seeped into my DNA\u201d and forced her to the polls.\n\nThen she encouraged women of all races \u2014 \u201csisters ... not just \u2018sistahs,\u2019\u201d she joked \u2014 to remember that they would have been \u201cjust a piece of property\u201d with no ballot barely a century ago.\n\nThe pitches from Pence and Winfrey clearly fit Abrams\u2019 and Kemp\u2019s respective strategies.\n\nKemp is trying to extend the Republican domination in Georgia, which hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat as governor since 1998. He\u2019s banking on running up wide margins outside metro Atlanta and holding most of the GOP votes closer to the city. Goosing a GOP base that holds Trump and Pence in high regard is key to the approach.\n\nAbrams is looking to maximize turnout among nonwhites, liberal urban whites and just enough whites everywhere else, including a smattering of moderates and suburban Republicans who are disenchanted with Trump \u2014 a considerable overlap with the fan base that propelled Winfrey to her billionaire icon status.\n\n___\n\nMartin reported from Dalton, Ga.

The 2018 election marks the first time that groups supporting gun control measures could spend more on a campaign than the National Rifle Association. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The National Rifle Association \u2014 long seen as a kingmaker in Republican politics \u2014 is taking a lower profile in this year\u2019s high-stakes midterm campaign, a sign of the shifting dynamics of the gun debate as the GOP fights to maintain its grip on Congress.\n\nThe NRA has put $11 million into midterm races this year \u2014 less than half what it spent four years ago in an election that gave Republicans full control of Congress. This year\u2019s totals are also far below the $54 million the group spent in 2016 on both the presidential and congressional races.\n\nThe shift comes as spending to support tougher gun control measures has surged. Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, pledged $30 million for this year\u2019s election and has continued to put new money into competitive races in the final days. A political action committee formed by Gabby Giffords, the former congresswoman wounded in a shooting, is spending nearly $5 million.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time under current campaign finance laws that the NRA might be outspent by gun control groups, though the organization often ramps up spending late in the campaign. That money won\u2019t show up in federal financial reports until after Election Day.\n\nIt all underscores a changing political landscape on guns after a series of election year mass shootings, including the February massacre at a Parkland, Florida, high school that left 17 people dead, and Saturday\u2019s deadly attack at a Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\n\u201cThe politics of guns has changed,\u201d said Jim Kessler, the senior vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist think tank. \u201cThe groups supporting more gun safety restrictions are smarter than in the past and have more resources, both in terms of people and money, than in the past.\u201d\n\nWith polls showing that the majority of Americans now support at least some tightening of gun laws, the issue is no longer taboo in swing districts, particularly the suburban areas that could determine which party controls the House next year. Everytown and Giffords\u2019 group are on the air in competitive districts in Texas, Virginia, Kansas and elsewhere.\n\nAfter the Pittsburgh shooting, a Bloomberg aide said Everytown bought another $700,000 in advertisements aimed at ousting Rep. Mike Coffman, a vulnerable Republican who represents a suburban Denver district \u2014 a significant sum to spend on a single House race in one week.\n\nThe group has also spent about $4 million in the Atlanta suburbs to back Democrat and gun control advocate Lucy McBath, whose son was shot and killed in 2012.\n\nDespite the public polling, there are no guarantees that sending more pro-gun-control lawmakers to Washington would result in tougher legislation. Modest measures have repeatedly been blocked in Congress, even as Americans have grown more supportive of steps like banning assault weapons and tightening background checks.\n\nBloomberg, who is weighing a run for president as a Democrat in 2020, promises to keep up the pressure on lawmakers and candidates he\u2019s backing if they end up on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve put an awful lot of my money and an awful lot of my time into this,\u201d he said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m not going to forget it. I\u2019m not going to walk away.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe nice thing about the House, it may be a stupidly designed system, but if they don\u2019t do what they said they were going to do, you get another crack at deciding to support them or somebody else two years from now.\u201d\n\nAn NRA spokeswoman would not comment on the group\u2019s election spending compared to organizations pushing for stricter gun laws.\n\nBloomberg, who is spending $120 million on the midterms, has helped pro-gun control groups level a playing field long dominated by the NRA.\n\nThe organization was riding high after the 2016 election, with a strong supporter in the White House and Republicans in charge of both the House and Senate.\n\nBut 2018 has proved to be a tumultuous year for the NRA. The group has faced boycotts from parts of corporate America in the wake of mass shootings, as well as an investigation into what federal authorities allege were covert Russian agents seeking to influence the 2016 election to benefit Trump by courting NRA officials and funneling money through the group.\n\nPublicly, the NRA has portrayed itself as being in financial distress because of deep-pocketed liberal opposition to guns and what it calls the mainstream media \u201cspewing toxic lies\u201d about the group. Over the summer, the organization raised its annual dues fees from $40 to $45 \u2014 the second increase in two years.\n\nNRA watchers dismiss the notion that the organization is in trouble and say it\u2019s more of a ploy to energize its ardent supporters, which in turn could help bring in more donations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the NRA\u2019s interests to exaggerate how much trouble it\u2019s in,\u201d said Robert J. Spitzer, chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland and an expert on guns and the Second Amendment.\n\nIndeed, the group\u2019s political fundraising is up this year compared to the last midterm election. According to data provided by an NRA official, the group\u2019s Political Victory Fund has raised more than $12 million this year compared to nearly $11 million at this same point in the 2014 midterms.\n\nWhile the NRA is not pumping the same levels of money into this year\u2019s elections, it still has much at its disposal to try to sway campaigns: its NRATV media arm, social media and an ability to mobilize its millions of members to get them to the polls.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s membership rolls and finances are not public, but the organization has said it has about 6 million in its ranks. Those who closely watch the group believe its membership is closer to 4 million.\n\nBoth the NRA and groups such as Everytown can also quietly influence elections with money that doesn\u2019t have to be reported in publicly available campaign finance reports.\n\n___\n\nPane reported from Boise, Idaho.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Perhaps nowhere is the choice facing voters on Tuesday more vividly on display than in the battle for control of the U.S. House. Democrats are fielding more women and minority candidates than ever, while Republicans are trying to hold their majority with mostly white men.\n\nThe disparity highlights a trend that has been amplified under President Donald Trump, with the two parties increasingly polarized along gender and racial lines as much as by issues. The result is that, in an election season playing out against the backdrop of bomb threats, violence and a charged immigration debate, the parties are presenting voters starkly different pictures of American leadership.\n\nDemocrats have nominated more than 180 female candidates for the House, a record. But while voters could send more than 100 of them to victory, Republicans could have fewer women than now in their ranks next year due to retirements and tough races, according to election analysts. Overall, nearly 9 in 10 House Republicans will be white men when the new Congress convenes in January.\n\nThe racial divide is even starker. House Republicans now count just over a dozen minority members, a number that\u2019s not expected to change much after the election. The lack of minorities in the conference comes into sharp visual focus when House Republicans gather in a large group, as they did last December when they celebrated the passage of tax cuts with Trump at the White House.\n\nIn races across the U.S. this midterm election, candidates of color are running for office in record numbers. In a hotly contested gubernatorial race in Georgia, it's also highlighting issues of voting rights across the state. (Oct. 30)\n\nMeanwhile, African-American, Latino and Asian-American lawmakers make up almost half the House Democratic caucus. And for the first time, less than half the Democratic candidates for the House are white men, and the Democrats are poised to send the first Native American and Muslim-American women to the House. It\u2019s what the Reflective Democracy Campaign calls a \u201chistoric shift.\u201d\n\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s election, it\u2019s likely that 87 percent of Republicans in the House will be white men, compared with just 37 percent for Democrats, said David Wasserman, who analyzes races for the Cook Political Report.\n\nMarc Hetherington, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said the trend began long before this year\u2019s election. \u201cThere\u2019s a relatively easy explanation \u2014 the Republican Party over the past 20 years has become the party of white men,\u201d he said. At the same time, \u201cDemocrats have come to be seen as the party of minorities.\u201d\n\nPolitical scientists have been debating whether Congress\u2019 low approval rating \u2014 now 21 percent \u2014 has something to do with lawmakers not seeming to reflect the country they represent, said Matt Barreto, a professor at UCLA who is also a pollster working to mobilize Latino voters this cycle. Overall, while the House is closer to reflecting the makeup of the country, which is still majority white, the representation is lopsided between the parties.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants a representative from their community to stand up for their issues,\u201d Barreto said. For the House, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s the entire point: They\u2019re representatives.\u201d\n\nDemocrats need a net gain of 23 seats to win back the House in Tuesday\u2019s election. Enthusiasm has seemed to be on their side, especially in fundraising, but it\u2019s unclear if that energy will be enough to win districts that swung to Trump in 2016 or have traditionally favored Republicans.\n\nThe outcome could hinge on the suburbs, where Democrats are hoping that a voter backlash against Trump and GOP policies will help carry their candidates to victory.\n\nOne closely watched race is outside of Richmond, Virginia, where Republican Rep. Dave Brat, a one-time tea party favorite, is facing a stiff challenge from political newcomer Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA operative.\n\nBrat was campaigning over the weekend at the Innsbrook Pumpkin Palooza, pausing to watch a pumpkin catapult as he mingled with voters. Trump supporter Jen Dodge from nearby Glen Ellen said she\u2019s all for bringing more diversity to Congress. But as an employment recruiter, she said she also wants the best candidate for the job. And she said she appreciates what the president and the Republican Congress have done for the economy, especially by passing tax cuts.\n\n\u201cWe really need people in the Congress who are going to speak the best for the people,\u201d she said. Brat, she said, \u201cdoes what he says he\u2019s going to do.\u201d\n\nDown the road at a community forum with Spanberger, optometrist Lisa Bennett said she wants lawmakers who listen to voters.\n\n\u201cAmerican people are frustrated,\u201d she said, recalling the protesters who confronted senators on Capitol Hill over Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to stand in an elevator and yell at your representative.\u201d\n\nThe diversity gap between the parties has been growing since the civil rights battles of the 1960s, when white voters shifted toward Republicans and the party\u2019s support from African-Americans plummeted.\n\nRepublicans set out to attract more votes from minorities and particularly Latinos after their election losses in 2012, but Trump turned that political strategy on its head in 2016, showing they could win by pulling white voters away from Democrats. Now the president\u2019s coalition is being put to the test.\n\nAfter conducting a poll of 72 competitive House districts, the Cook Political Report and LSU Manship School said this year\u2019s election \u201cfeels like 2010, in reverse.\u201d Almost half of Americans, 49 percent \u201cfeel frustrated\u201d about Trump\u2019s presidency. That\u2019s the same share who said they felt frustrated about President Barack Obama during that year\u2019s midterm elections, when Democrats lost the majority in a wave election fueled by conservative newcomers eager to confront the White House.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics .\n\n___\n\nFollow Mascaro on Twitter at https://twitter.com/lisamascaro and listen to AP\u2019s political podcast Ground Game at https://apnews.com/GroundGamePodcast/", "President Donald Trump talks about immigration and border security from the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Thursday he plans to sign an order next week that could lead to the large-scale detention of migrants crossing the southern border and bar anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum \u2014 two legally dubious proposals that mark his latest election-season barrage against illegal immigration.\n\nTrump also said he had told the U.S. military mobilizing at the southwest border that if U.S. troops face rock-throwing migrants, they should react as though the rocks were \u201crifles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an invasion,\u201d Trump declared, as he has previously on a subject that has been shown to resonate strongly with his base of Republican supporters. He made his comments at the White House in a rambling, campaign-style speech that was billed as a response to caravans of migrants traveling slowly by foot toward the U.S. border. But Trump offered few details on how exactly he planned to overhaul an asylum system he claimed was plagued by \u201cendemic abuse\u201d that he said \u201cmakes a mockery of our immigration system.\u201d\n\nU.S. immigration laws make clear that migrants seeking asylum may do so either at or between border crossings. But Trump said he would limit that to official crossing points. The U.S. also doesn\u2019t have space at the border to manage the large-scale detention of migrants, with most facilities at capacity. Trump said the government would erect \u201cmassive tents\u201d instead.\n\nHis announcement marked Trump\u2019s latest attempt to keep the issue of immigration front-and-center in the final stretch before next Tuesday\u2019s elections. Trump has spent the waning days of the campaign hammering the issue at every occasion as he tries to energize Republican voters using the same playbook that helped him win in 2016. In addition to deploying the military to the southern border to stave off the caravan, Trump announced plans to try to end the constitutionally-protected right of birthright citizenship for all children born in the U.S.\n\nHe brought up immigration issues several times during a political rally Thursday night in Columbia, Missouri. He railed against \u201cbirth tourism,\u201d where mothers from abroad travel to America to have babies so they will automatically be U.S. citizens. And he denounced \u201cchain migration,\u201d where these new citizens then bring in their extended families into the country.\n\n\u201cYou come into the country \u2014 you\u2019re like two months old ... and you\u2019re gonna bring \u2019em all \u2014 your aunts and uncles and grandfathers and lots of people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president announced Wednesday that he was considering deploying up to 15,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexican border in response to the caravans \u2014 roughly double the number the Pentagon said it currently plans for a mission that has been criticized as unnecessary, considering the caravans remain hundreds of miles away.\n\nTrump said Thursday he was \u201cnot going to put up with\u201d any sort of violence directed at those U.S. forces, warning the military would fight back. \u201cWhen they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I say consider it a rifle,\u201d he said.\n\nThe exact rules for the use of force by military police and other soldiers who will be operating near the border have not been disclosed, but in all cases troops have the right of self-defense.\n\nStill, Mark Hertling, a retired Army general, wrote on Twitter after Trump\u2019s speech that no military officer would allow a soldier to shoot an individual throwing a rock. \u201cIt would be an unlawful order,\u201d he wrote, citing the Law of Land Warfare.\n\nTrump said Thursday that, under his order, any migrants who do enter the country would be housed in \u201cmassive tent cities\u201d he plans to build while their cases are processed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to catch, we\u2019re not going to release,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder current protocol, many asylum seekers are released while their cases make their way through backlogged courts \u2014 a process that can take years.\n\nCritics said the speech seemed mostly designed to scare, with no specifics on what mechanisms Trump intended to use to push through his desired changes. Administration officials have told The AP that Trump intends to invoke the same authority he used to push through his controversal travel ban, but it\u2019s not clear if that\u2019s what he was doing with Thursday\u2019s speech.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really trying to scare the American public into thinking these are thousands of dangerous thugs,\u201d said Greg Chen, of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic strategy that goes back to 19th century nativist thinking.\u201d\n\nTrump and other administration officials have long said those seeking asylum should come through legal ports of entry. But many migrants are unaware of that guidance, and official border crossings have grown increasingly clogged. Immigration officials have turned away asylum-seekers at border crossings because of overcrowding, telling them to return at a later date. Backlogs have become especially bad in recent months at crossings in California, Arizona and Texas, with people generally waiting five weeks to try to claim asylum at San Diego\u2019s main crossing and sleeping out in the open for days at a time.\n\nMigrants who cross illegally are generally arrested and often seek asylum or some other form of protection. Claims have spiked in recent years, and there is currently a backlog of more than 800,000 cases pending in immigration court. Administration officials have railed against what they say are loopholes designed to encourage people, especially from Central America, to come to the U.S. and claim asylum. Generally, only about 20 percent of applicants are approved.\n\nThe U.S. fielded more than 330,000 asylum claims in 2017, nearly double the number two years earlier and surpassing Germany as highest in the world.\n\nBut it remains unclear how many people currently en route to the U.S. will even make it to the border.\n\nThere are currently four caravans. The main group of about 4,000 migrants \u2014 down from its estimated peak of more than 7,000 \u2014 remains in southern Mexico, hundreds of miles from the border. A second, smaller group of 1,000 or so is more than 200 miles behind the first. A third band of about 500 from El Salvador has made it to Guatemala, and a fourth group of about 700 set out from the Salvadoran capital Wednesday.\n\nSimilar caravans have gathered regularly over the years and have generally dwindled by the time they reach the southern border. And most have passed largely unnoticed.\n\nTrump has nonetheless mounted an enormous show of force in response to their movement \u2014 coinciding with elections that will determine which party controls Congress.\n\nThe first 100 active duty troops arrived at the border in McAllen, Texas, on Thursday \u2014 part of the \u201cmore than 7,000\u201d troops the Pentagon said were being sent to support Customs and Border Protection agents.\n\n\u201cThese illegal caravans will not be allowed into the United States and they should turn back now because they\u2019re wasting their time,\u201d Trump said Thursday.\n\nNotably, he said his executive order would come next week, which means it could be after Election Day.\n\nTrump has rejected the idea he has been \u201cfearmongering\u201d and using the issue for political purposes, but on Thursday he blamed Democrats for the \u201cincompetent, very, very stupid laws that we have.\u201d He noted at one point, \u201cWomen want security.\u201d\n\nTrump also tweeted a video Wednesday alleging, without evidence, that Democrats were responsible for allowing a homicidal immigrant into the U.S. The video was reminiscent of the infamous \u201cWillie Horton\u201d ad used against Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988 and condemned as racist.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Elliot Spagat in San Diego, Amy Taxin in Santa Ana, California, and Zeke Miller and Robert Burns in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n__\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "CLARKSVILLE, Pa.

(AP Photo/Mauro Buccarello)\n\nRAS JEBEL, Tunisia (AP) \u2014 When Khalid Arfaoui\u2019s friends knocked on his door in May 2011 to signal their departure by boat from Tunisia to Europe, it wasn\u2019t fear that held him back, but a lack of cash.\n\nEveryone needed to chip in to pay for the boat, gas and supplies, and he was short about $100. So he sat inside and watched as they left for the beachside campsite where even today locals spend the night before embarking north.\n\nPropelled by a feeble outboard motor and overburdened, the rubber raft flipped, possibly after grazing rocks just offshore. The lone survivor was found clinging to debris eight hours later. Two bodies were retrieved, and 11 young men are missing.\n\nAs global migration has soared to record highs, far less visible has been its toll: The tens of thousands of people who die or simply disappear during their journeys, never to be seen again. A growing number of migrants have drowned, died in deserts or fallen prey to traffickers, leaving their families to wonder what on earth happened to them. At the same time, anonymous bodies are filling cemeteries around the world.\n\nIn most cases, nobody is keeping track: Barely counted in life, these people don\u2019t register in death, as if they never lived at all.\n\nAn Associated Press tally has documented at least 56,800 migrants dead or missing worldwide since 2014 \u2014 almost double the number found in the world\u2019s only official attempt to try to count them, by the U.N.\u2019s International Organization for Migration. The IOM toll as of Oct. 1 was more than 28,500.\n\nThe IOM\u2019s research was prompted by two shipwrecks and the deaths of at least 368 people off the coast of Italy in October 2013. It has focused mostly on fatalities in the Mediterranean, although its researchers plead for more data from elsewhere in the world. This year alone, the IOM has found more than 1,900 deaths in the waters that divide Africa and Europe, and more than 17,000 since 2014.\n\nBut even there, many of those who go missing are uncounted, including boatfuls of young Tunisians or Algerians and children whose parents lost track of them in the chaos of land border crossings. In all, The Associated Press found nearly 4,900 people whose families say they simply disappeared without a trace in Europe or en route, including more than 2,700 children whose families reported them missing to the Red Cross.\n\nOf the world\u2019s migration crises, Europe\u2019s has been the most cruelly visible, with death playing out in videos and photographs. Images of the lifeless body of a Kurdish toddler on a beach, frozen tent camps in Eastern Europe, and a nearly numbing succession of deadly shipwrecks have been transmitted around the world, adding to the furor around migration.\n\nIn the Mediterranean, scores of tankers, cargo boats, cruise ships and military vessels tower over tiny, overcrowded rafts powered by an outboard motor for a one-way trip. Some larger wooden boats carry scores, even hundreds of migrants, but even they may go down when soft breezes turn into battering winds and thrashing waves further from shore.\n\nBut as the political tide in Europe turns against migrants, alive or dead, money is drying up for projects to track migration data and its costs. For example, when more than 800 people died in an April 2015 shipwreck off the coast of Italy, Europe\u2019s deadliest migrant sea disaster, Italian investigators pledged to identify them and find their families. More than three years later, under a new populist government, funding for this work has been cut off.\n\nIn the case of Arfaoui\u2019s friends, Tunisia\u2019s government has no official tally of the missing, and the group never made it close enough to Europe to catch the attention of authorities there. So these migrants never have been counted among the dead and missing.\n\n\u201cIf I had gone with them, I\u2019d be lost like the others,\u201d Arfaoui said recently, standing on the rocky shoreline with a group of friends, all of whom vaguely planned to leave for Europe. \u201cIf I get the chance, I\u2019ll do it. Even if I fear the sea and I know I might die, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nWith him that day was 30-year-old Mounir Aguida, who had already made the trip once, drifting for 19 hours after the boat engine cut out. In late August this year, he crammed into another raft with seven friends, feeling the waves slam the flimsy bow. At the last minute he and another young man jumped out.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right,\u201d Aguida said.\n\nThere has been no word from the other six \u2014 yet another group of Ras Jebel\u2019s youth lost to the sea. With no shipwreck reported, no survivors to rescue and no bodies to identify, the six young men are not counted in any toll.\n\nIn addition to watching its own youth flee, Tunisia and to a lesser degree neighboring Algeria are transit points for other Africans north bound for Europe. Tunisia has its own cemetery for unidentified migrants, as do Greece, Italy and Turkey. On Tunisia\u2019s southern coast, one is tended by an unemployed sailor named Chamseddin Marzouk.\n\nOf around 400 bodies interred in the coastal graveyard since it opened in 2005, only one has ever been identified. As for the others who lie beneath mounds of dirt, Marzouk couldn\u2019t imagine how their families would ever learn their fate.\n\n\u201cTheir families may think that the person is still alive, or that he\u2019ll return one day to visit,\u201d Marzouk said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know that those they await are buried here, in Zarzis, Tunisia.\u201d", "In this March 23, 2018 photo, an Argentine forensic anthropology team arrange burned fragments at a lab in Cuauhtemoc, Mexico.

The AP came up with almost 28,300 more from all regions, for a total of at least 56,800.\n\nUnlike the IOM, the AP included reports of missing loved ones to government agencies or independent organizations. Migrants disappear for a variety of reasons, but few are benign.\n\nThe AP also pulled together information from both formal and informal sources for a more comprehensive view. Many governments of origin cannot or will not keep records of the missing. Migration is expressly outlawed in some countries; even where it is legal, governments can be reluctant to acknowledge it, seeing it as an admission of failure.\n\nIn some places, aid groups such as the national Red Cross step in to fill the gap. In the United States, the Colibri Center for Human Rights accepts missing person reports from families of migrants. The center, along with the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team in Latin America, works to match the reports with unidentified bodies found along the paths of migration.\n\nThere is always a risk that one family\u2019s missing loved one is an unidentified body elsewhere, and could be double-counted. But the AP has avoided these cases where possible by taking a conservative approach. The AP focused especially on places where data is scarce and unlikely to be duplicated, including Latin America, Asia and Africa. For example, one of the main sources of new data, the Mixed Migration Centre\u2019s 4Mi project, is based in large part on interviews of migrants within Africa long before they reach the shores of the Mediterranean.\n\nIn the case of Asia, organizations that take reports from families about missing and dead migrants in the Philippines and Indonesia compiled their data at AP\u2019s request, as did an aid worker tracing Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar who disappeared in fleeing from mass killings last year. Other sources include forensic pathologists and government missing-person reports.\n\nAs with the IOM data, the AP tally includes deaths and disappearance of migrants in transport accidents, by illness, and through violence related to their irregular status once they have left their home countries when possible. If there is a question of possible duplication, we have discarded the entry.\n\nWe also discarded estimates in favor of precision. This means we have almost certainly undercounted deaths and disappearances. In the Americas, for example, some organizations estimate tens of thousands of migrant disappearances in recent years, but have been unable to provide tangible evidence of where and when.\n\nContributing to an undercount, bodies of migrants still lie undiscovered in desert sands or at the bottom of the sea. And families don\u2019t always report loved ones as missing because they migrated illegally, or because they left home without saying exactly where they were headed.", "Auction house to sell off early map of the NYC subway\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A New York City gallery will be putting historical maps up for display next month, include one that is believed to be the one of the first portable maps of the city\u2019s subway system.\n\nThe 1904 portable subway map was apparently mailed to customers of Wanamaker\u2019s department store.

(AP Photo/John Hanna)\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Opening a new polling site in the historic Wild West town of Dodge City, Kansas, just days before the election is not in the public\u2019s interest because it would likely create more voter confusion, a federal judge ruled Thursday.\n\nU.S. District Judge Daniel Crabtree denied the motion by the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas seeking a temporary court order forcing Ford County Clerk Deborah Cox to reopen a voting location at the old Civic Center location after she moved the city\u2019s only polling site to a facility outside city limits and more than a mile from the nearest bus stop.\n\nThe judge noted that since Sept. 28, Cox notified voters of the change by letter and through the media \u2014 advertising in newspapers, on the radio and on the county\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cFor the court to insert itself into this process on the eve of the election \u2014 by ordering the reopening of the Civic Center either as the only polling location or a second polling location \u2014 likely would create more voter confusion than it might cure,\u201d Crabtree wrote.\n\nThe only polling site for the city\u2019s now 13,000 registered voters for two decades was the Civic Center in a mostly white part of town. Cox decided to move the site to a new county Expo Center after learning that a construction project was planned for late October at the Civic Center \u2014 though work had not started as of Thursday.\n\nThe ACLU asked Crabtree to order Cox to open both the old and new polling sites for Tuesday for Election Day. The ACLU argues that moving the only polling site makes it more difficult for the city\u2019s mostly Hispanic population to vote.\n\nMicah Kubic, executive director of the ACLU of Kansas, said in an emailed statement that while they are disappointed by the ruling, they are also encouraged by much of it and hopeful about their prospects as the case moves forward.\n\n\u201cHad voters learned of her decision sooner, our case may have prevailed,\u201d Kubic said. \u201cShe can rest easy \u2014 for now \u2014that she was able to run out the clock.

They said the city has offered to take voters from their homes and jobs to the new polling place, and Cox said she reached out to the city again Thursday morning about moving voters between the old and new polling sites.\n\n\u201cThey do have a limited number of buses, however,\u201d she said.\n\nCox\u2019s conflict with the ACLU over the single polling site stretches back to at least May, when Johnny Dunlap, the Ford County Democratic Party chairman and a volunteer for an ACLU voting rights project, asked her to open a second polling site for Dodge City, according to testimony. Both he and Cox testified that Dunlap and her office had further run-ins during the August primary, and in October, the ACLU asked Cox to publicize a hotline for its voting rights project on her office\u2019s website.\n\nShe forwarded that request to the Kansas secretary of state\u2019s office in an Oct. 22 email saying, \u201cLOL.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I really meant is, \u2018Here we go again. Where is it going to stop?\u2019\u201d Cox testified.\n\nCrabtree wrote in his ruling he was troubled by Cox\u2019s reaction to the letter and questioned \u201cwhether it manifests a disregard for the \u2018fundamental significance\u2019 that our Constitution places on the right to vote.\u201d\n\nThe southwest Kansas city, located 160 miles (257 kilometers) west of Wichita, once was a destination for cattle drives where cowboys and gunslingers tangled.

They called on Cuba to fully grant its citizens \u201cinternationally recognized civil, political and economic rights and freedoms,\u201d to establish an independent civil society and to release people detained for exercising their human rights.\n\nCuba\u2019s Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez called the U.S. embargo \u201ca flagrant, massive and systematic violation of the human rights of Cuban men and women\u201d and denounced what he called the politicized U.S. amendments.\n\n\u201cThe government of the United States doesn\u2019t have the least moral authority to criticize Cuba or anyone when it comes to human rights,\u201d he said.\n\nRodriguez accused the U.S. government of committing \u201ccrimes against humanity,\u201d pointing to its dropping of the atom bomb in Japan in World War II, waging wars that \u201ccaused the death of millions, many of them innocent,\u201d and carrying out what he claimed were \u201cextrajudicial executions, kidnapping and torture.\u201d He also accused the U.S. of violating the human rights of its citizens, singling out Afro-Americans, Hispanics, minorities, refugees and migrants.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley stressed before the votes that \u201cour reason for the embargo is and has always been Cuba\u2019s denial of freedom and the denial of the most basic human rights for the Cuban people.\u201d\n\nShe urged the General Assembly to use its \u201cmegaphone\u201d and \u201csend a moral message to the Cuban dictatorship\u201d that could help improve the lives of the Cuban people.\n\nBut the United States failed to get support even from Western nations.\n\nThe European Union said the U.S. amendments did not belong in a resolution dealing with a trade embargo, and its members supported the resolution calling for the United States \u201cto repeal or invalidate\u201d the embargo. Canada also spoke out against the amendments.\n\nBefore the vote Haley said: \u201cWe have no problem standing alone on behalf of the things that we believe in and will proudly do so again today if necessary.\u201d\n\nFollowing the U.S. defeat, however, Haley told the General Assembly: \u201cThere are no winners here today, there are only losers.\u201d\n\nShe said the U.N. \u201clost the opportunity to speak on behalf of human rights,\u201d but most of all the Cuban people have \u201cbeen left, once again, to the brutal winds of the Castro dictatorship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have been abandoned by the United Nations and most of the world\u2019s governments, but the Cuban people are not alone today,\u201d Haley said. \u201cThe American people will stand with them until they are restored the rights that God has given us all, rights that no government can legitimately deny its people.\u201d\n\nThe decision by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to call for a vote on each of the eight amendments represents an escalation of its action last year and reflects worsening U.S.-Cuban relations.\n\nCuban President Raul Castro and then-President Barack Obama officially restored relations in July 2016. But Ambassador Haley and others have sharply criticized Cuba\u2019s human rights record. In 2017, the U.S. returned to voting against the resolution condemning the American economic embargo after the Obama administration abstained in 2016, a first for the United States in 25 years.\n\nThursday\u2019s vote came shortly before Trump\u2019s national security adviser John Bolton announced in Florida that the administration is imposing new sanctions on Cuba and Venezuela and soon on Nicaragua, calling the three countries a \u201ctroika of tyranny.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, diplomats voiced their support for the Cuban resolution.\n\nEgyptian Ambassador Mohamed Edrees, speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 which represents 135 developing countries and China, pointed to \u201cthe positive steps ... focused in the right direction\u201d taken by the Obama administration and expressed regret at the Trump administration\u2019s new policy \u201caimed at strengthening the embargo against Cuba.\u201d\n\nAmbassador Sheila Carey of the Bahamas reiterated the Caribbean Community\u2019s \u201cunequivocal opposition\u201d to the embargo and said last year\u2019s near unanimous vote in favor of immediately lifting the embargo \u201cis a clear indication of prevalent disapproval by the U.N. membership.\u201d\n\nSouth African Ambassador Jerry Matjila expressed regret that the gradual relaxation of the embargo under Obama has been reversed \u201cand the people of Cuba are once again faced with a monumental obstacle toward the fulfillment of their basic human rights, including the right to development.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the 193-member General Assembly adopted the Cuban-sponsored resolution by a vote of 191-2, with Israel joining the U.S. in voting \u201cno.\u201d That was the same vote as in 2015.", "Portland Timbers midfielder Diego Valeri (8) celebrates after scoring a goal against FC Dallas during the first half of an MLS soccer playoff match in Frisco, Texas, Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2018.

(AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)\n\nJUCHITAN, Mexico (AP) \u2014 Thousands of Central American migrants resumed their slow trek through southern Mexico on Thursday, as immigration agents and police nibbled at the edges of the two caravans currently in the country.\n\nMexican authorities haven\u2019t directly targeted the main caravan of about 4,000 migrants, and activists aiding that group said they were shifting their route toward the Gulf coast, a path closer to the Texas border.\n\nBut a second, smaller caravan about 200 miles behind the first group appeared to be more leaderless, get less press attention and be more vulnerable.\n\nA federal official who was not authorized to be quoted by name said 153 migrants in the second caravan were detained Wednesday during highway inspections in the southern state of Chiapas, a short distance from the Guatemalan border. While the precise size of the second caravan is unclear, that could be equivalent to about 10 percent of those participating.\n\nAnd there was also pressure on the first caravan, which set out before dawn Thursday from Juchitan, Oaxaca, seeking to reach the town of Matias Romero, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) ahead.\n\nThey had tried to arrange bus transport from Juchitan, but failed, leaving them once again on foot, hitch-hiking and looking for rides where they can find them.\n\nThousands of Central American migrants resumed their slow trek through southern Mexico on Thursday, shifting their route toward the Gulf coast, a path closer to the Texas border.

On previous days, they have ordered passenger vans to stop transporting migrants.\n\nThe migrants have not said what route they intend to take northward or where on the U.S. border they planned to reach.\n\nWhile Matias Romero would take them toward the Gulf coast city of Veracruz and a route toward the Texas border, another large caravan early this year passed through Veracruz and then veered back toward Mexico City and eventually tried to head to Tijuana in the far northwest. Few made it.\n\nIn Matias Romero, the migrants complained of bad smells and snakes in the area where they were told to camp overnight at the entrance to the town. Local authorities told them they couldn\u2019t occupy the main square because of Day of the Dead events to be held there.\n\nLate Thursday, the migrants decided to leave at 5 a.m. Friday toward Veracruz, with their destination either Donaji or Sayula de Aleman.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Wednesday praised Mexico for stopping the migrants from getting rides.\n\n\u201cMexico has stepped up in an unprecedented way,\u201d Sanders told Fox News. \u201cThey have helped stop a lot of the transportation means of these individuals in these caravans, forcing them walking.

The Interior Department said Thursday that the number of migrants who have applied for refuge was now nearly 3,000.\n\nThe initial caravan has shrunk significantly from its estimated peak of more than 7,000 migrants.

Virginia's westernmost county had appeared to be on track to reopen its only hospital, a rare accomplishment a rural community anywhere in the country. But questions involving the company expected to run the Lee County facility have thrown the plan into question at the last minute. (AP Photo/Earl Neikirk)\n\nRICHMOND, Va. (AP) \u2014 It was lunchtime on Election Day and Gary McElyea, a councilman in a small town perched in Virginia\u2019s sprawling westernmost county, was campaigning under a tent when the heart attack struck.\n\n\u201cWe were out at the polls, and he just hit the ground,\u201d said fellow Pennington Gap councilwoman Jill Carson, who described an agonizing wait for a helicopter to arrive and whisk McElyea to a Tennessee hospital about 40 miles (64 kilometers) away.\n\nThere was nowhere local to go for care because Lee County\u2019s only hospital, about a mile down the road from where McElyea fell ill, abruptly shut its doors in 2013.\n\nIn the five years since, local community leaders have been fighting to reopen the facility, and after a series of fits and starts, it looked for much of this year like that might happen thanks to a deal with a startup company. But financial challenges the company acknowledges it\u2019s been working through have thrown the plan into question at the last minute, officials say. It\u2019s a story that illustrates the herculean task of trying to revive a shuttered rural hospital and the harsh realities of disparate access to health care in many parts of America.\n\n\u201cOur county desperately needs a hospital,\u201d said Dr. J. Scott Litton Jr., a family medicine doctor and a native of mountainous Lee County, which is home to some 24,000 people. One of Virginia\u2019s poorest counties, hit hard by the opioid crisis and the decline of the coal industry, Lee County stretches some 70 miles (113 kilometers) across, into the corner where the state meets Kentucky and Tennessee.\n\nLitton and other local officials and community leaders say the closure has been devastating, resulting not only in far longer travel times for patients like McElyea but also a strain on emergency services and the local economy. Some are convinced people have died because of a lack of access to care.\n\nLitton said it\u2019s not unusual to have patients waiting in his parking lot before the office opens, often with issues that would be better treated at an emergency department.\n\n\u201cWe have patients that walk in with fractures, and patients that walk in with their hand wrapped with a towel with an active, bleeding laceration,\u201d Litton said.\n\nLee County\u2019s long, triangular shape has made the loss of the hospital \u201ca nightmare for emergency responders,\u201d said county administrator Dane Poe.\n\nIn some areas, it\u2019s now at least an hour to get to a hospital of any kind, and the closest trauma center is in Kingsport, Tennessee, Poe said. That can mean a three- to four-hour turnaround on a single call for the county\u2019s patchwork of volunteer rescue squads.\n\nThe closing also cost the county jobs and has made it harder to recruit new industries or even workers to the area, Poe said.\n\nMany residents were shocked when the hospital\u2019s previous owner announced closure plans in 2013 shortly after renovating the emergency room. But the closure fell in line with a national trend of struggling rural hospitals shutting their doors.\n\nAccording to the North Carolina Rural Health Research Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 89 rural hospitals have closed since January 2010. Eight have reopened.\n\nAnother 673 rural facilities, or about a third nationwide, are vulnerable and could close, according to the National Rural Health Association.\n\nIn addition to the challenge of hospital closures, rural America generally has fewer physicians to serve residents more likely than their urban counterparts to be older, uninsured and living in poverty.\n\nAfter the hospital closure, Lee County rallied. They held organizing meetings, looked for potential new operators and formed a hospital authority, a move that took special approval from the state legislature.\n\nThe authority members then obtained a certificate from the state to operate a hospital. They sought advice and help from the state\u2019s congressional delegation.\n\nThey purchased the building, then kept it up by paying for basic maintenance on things like the grounds and the boiler system, according to a hospital authority report.\n\nAbout three years into that effort, Americore Health, a newly formed rural hospital management and acquisition company, approached the group about a reopening.\n\nThe company has already invested around $5 million into opening the facility and will likely spend around another $2 million, Americore CEO Grant White said. Plans call for a 25-bed acute care hospital with two general purpose operating rooms opening by Dec. 31 \u2014 a deadline under the existing certificate of public need from the state.\n\nBy all accounts, Americore had been working diligently on the reopening until mid-August, when work on the project seemed to come to a halt, said Jeff Mitchell, a Blacksburg-based attorney for the authority. Authority members also started seeing news reports about problems at the company\u2019s other hospitals, including unpaid tax bills , payroll snags , layoffs and disputes with lenders .\n\nThe authority recently gave the company two weeks to provide evidence of the \u201cviability and sustainability of the project,\u201d Mitchell said. He said he expects the board to determine at its next meeting Thursday whether it thinks the company can get the hospital reopened and consider next steps.\n\nWhite said he thinks Americore can satisfy the authority and is committed to seeing the project through.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pushing full steam ahead to get the place reopened by the end of the year,\u201d he said Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, the community is hoping and praying for the best, McElyea and others said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of anything more important to Lee County right now, or anytime, than a hospital,\u201d said longtime sheriff Gary Parsons.", "SANFORD, Maine (AP) \u2014 Maine\u2019s Congressional delegation says a rug manufacturer in the state has succeeded in its application for an exemption from a tariff on yarn it uses to make products.\n\nThe company, Flemish Master Weavers of Sanford, is one of the largest manufacturing businesses in southern Maine.

Refugee advocates welcomed the change for children, 46 of whom were born in Nauru.\n\nActivists said there were only 38 children remaining on Nauru by Thursday. Papua New Guinea has male-only facilities and all asylum seekers there are adults.\n\nThe news was met with mixed reactions from those who remain on Nauru.\n\nHelia, 15, a refugee from Iran, said she was worried that her parents may not be able to get work visas in Australia or lead normal lives there.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to me if we move,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if we stay here, I still don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nShe said two close friends moved to Australia a few months ago, and it has been good for them because they can finally go to school, make new friends and go out at night.\n\nBut Helia said she really wants to move to New Zealand, if Australia would take up its offer to resettle 150 refugees from Nauru and Papua New Guinea. That way, she said, she\u2019d have a better future and be free.\n\nMehdi, 38, said it was great news that all the kids are being moved off Nauru, and they should have first priority. But he said he and the other adults who don\u2019t have children wonder what will happen to them.\n\n\u201cWe all worry about our situation, what will happen to us, what they will do to us after they evacuate all the kids from Nauru,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are worried, and the situation is getting worse day by day.\u201d\n\nThe refugees did not want their full names used due to fear of reprisals.\n\nAustralia\u2019s top diplomat in Britain, High Commissioner George Brandis, told London radio LBC that the government expects all asylum seeking children to be moved from Nauru to Australia this year.\n\n\u201cThere are hardly any children on Nauru ... and we expect that by the end of this year, there will be none,\u201d Brandis said.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison offered few details on Thursday.\n\n\u201cChildren have been transferred off Nauru, that\u2019s been happening for some time,\u201d Morrison told Sydney Radio 2GB.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been showboating about it. I haven\u2019t been drawing attention to it. It\u2019s been done in accordance with our policies, our existing policies and I obviously don\u2019t go into the operational arrangements,\u201d Morrison added.\n\nWhen Morrison took office in an internal government leadership ballot in August, there were 113 asylum seeker children on Nauru. Last week, the government said that number was down to 52.\n\nAustralia has all but ended the people-smuggling traffic from Southeast Asian ports since it announced that any asylum seekers who attempt reach Australian shores by boat from July 19, 2013, would never be allowed to settle in Australia.\n\nPressure has mounted on the government to make an exception for children, but some government lawmakers argue that would only encourage asylum seekers to put children at risk by bringing them on treacherous voyages to Australia on rickety fishing boats.\n\nThe United States agreed in 2016 to accept up to 1,250 refugees from Nauru and Papua New Guinea.

Andrew Cuomo didn\u2019t show, but his four challengers swapped ideas and joined together to criticize the incumbent in a largely amiable debate Thursday night in Albany.\n\nAnd while the Democratic incumbent may not have been present \u2014 unless you count a man in a chicken outfit wearing a \u201cCuomo\u201d sign \u2014 he was the main topic of conversation, with all four of Cuomo\u2019s challengers agreeing that voters need an alternative.\n\n\u201cShame on Andrew Cuomo for not coming here,\u201d said Green Party nominee Howie Hawkins in one of the evening\u2019s biggest applause lines. \u201cThe question in this election is this: Are we going to give Cuomo a free ride or are we going to demand more?\u201d\n\nHawkins, Libertarian Larry Sharpe, Republican Marc Molinaro and independent Stephanie Miner all slammed the incumbent\u2019s handling of political corruption, upstate economic development and taxes and used the debate \u2014 which was not televised \u2014 to highlight their own records and ideas.\n\nMiner touted her experience as a two-term Democratic mayor of Syracuse, where she said she worked to improve high-school graduation rates and the city\u2019s crumbling water and sewer lines. As mayor she emerged as a leading critic of the governor.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that the system works very well for the people it rewards,\u201d she said during a discussion about the need to reform byzantine voting rules blamed for dampening voter turnout in the state.\n\nSharpe, a businessman, said the state\u2019s problems demand a new approach untethered to traditional politics. As an example, he proposed selling the naming rights to bridges and roads to raise money for maintenance.\n\n\u201cWho has the newest ideas? This guy here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the one talking about new and different things.\u201d\n\nHawkins called for big investments in education, renewable energy and roads, bridges and water infrastructure. He blamed both parties for not doing enough to address water quality and climate change. In the 2014 governor\u2019s race, Hawkins placed third after Cuomo and Republican Rob Astorino.\n\nMolinaro, who polls say is comfortably in second place in the race, cited his tenure as Dutchess County executive and said he would work with all parties to find solutions to the state\u2019s problems. Molinaro was elected mayor of Tivoli, New York, at age 19.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent every day of my adult life making government function for people,\u201d he said. \u201cToday after 8 years of the \u2018status Cuomo\u2019 we are the highest taxed state in America. We have the most corrupted state government... We need to start again.\u201d\n\nFar ahead in the polls and in fundraising, Cuomo doesn\u2019t need the exposure from a debate as much as his rivals do. He debated Molinaro last week in a one-on-one exchange in New York City.\n\nOn Thursday, Cuomo was in Syracuse to announce the completion of an airport renovation project. While Cuomo hasn\u2019t said why he skipped the debate, his campaign said he\u2019s keeping busy ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cThe governor will be spending the final days of the campaign speaking directly with voters and helping to elect Democrats up and down the ticket,\u201d campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith said.", "Today in History\n\nToday is Thursday, Nov. 1, the 305th day of 2018.

Sabonis hit two free throws, and then Oladipo picked off Tim Hardaway Jr.\u2019s lazy dribble and threw down a breakaway dunk for a 98-97 lead.\n\nIndiana scored the next five points, capped by Oladipo\u2019s 3-pointer with 1:23 left, to make it 103-97 after the star guard had hit just one of his previous seven 3s.\n\n\u201cSome of the shots I feel like I normally make I wasn\u2019t making today,\u201d Oladipo said. \u201cSo got to find other ways to win, got other ways to impact the game.\u201d\n\nHardaway led the Knicks with 37 points, and Noah Vonleh had 14 points and 10 rebounds. New York has lost six of seven since winning on opening night.\n\nTheir inability to execute several times coming out of timeouts cost them in the fourth quarter on top of the five turnovers that Indiana converted into eight points.\n\n\u201cComing out of the timeout we gotta know our plays. We know how the defensive concepts are,\u201d said Hardaway Jr., who had a career-high seven 3s.\n\n\u201cIt is youth, it comes with that.\u201d\n\nAfter Thaddeus Young\u2019s hook shot made it 100-97, Knicks coach David Fizdale gathered his group with 1:55 remaining.\n\nNew York\u2019s youthfulness caught up as some of the players weren\u2019t aware where they needed to be before Hardaway misfired on a 3-point attempt which led to a 3 from Oladipo to put Indiana up by six.\n\nAlonzo Trier\u2019s basket cut New York\u2019s deficit to 103-101 with 44 seconds left. Indiana called a timeout and almost gave New York the ball back when Bogdan Bogdanovic missed an open 3, but Young recovered the offensive rebound and found Oladipo open in front of the Knicks bench for a 3-pointer.\n\n\u201cThad stayed alert, got the ball to Victor, and Victor found a rhythm that second half,\u201d Pacers coach Nate McMillan said.\n\n\u201cNothing was falling for him early but he stayed with it and made some big shots going down the stretch.\u201d\n\nYoung had 13 points, 10 rebounds and five steals.\n\nBACK IN\n\nNew York native and former Knicks player Kyle O\u2019Quinn got a nice hand from the Madison Square Garden crowd when he entered late in the second quarter. O\u2019Quinn signed a one-year deal with Indiana after opting out of the final year of his contract in New York.\n\nHis decision landed him $4.5 million, a $200,000 raise.\n\n\u201cYou talk to your agent, you talk to your family, but you have to make it,\u201d O\u2019Quinn said before the nationally televised game. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest decision I\u2019ve ever made as far as making a choice in my career. I slept on it, prayed on it. It\u2019s no secret I would\u2019ve loved to play for (new Knicks coach David) Fizdale or be here.\u201d\n\nTIP-INS\n\nPacers: Sabonis also had nine rebounds to go along with his career scoring night. . Bogdanovic had 10 points.\n\nKnicks: Damyean Dotson picked up his 10th straight game with at least 10 points. He finished with 13 over 32 minutes. . Hardaway Jr., who made a career-high 10 field goals, has led the team in scoring in seven games this season. He is also the first team player who has tallied at least 24 points in seven of the first eight games of the season.

The Nets snapped a three-game losing streak to improve to 3-5.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in this experience a lot,\u201d Harris said. \u201cA lot of close (games) last year. A lot of close games to start the season. For us to close one out (and) execute down the stretch_take care of the ball and execute defensively_this is huge in terms of confidence for us and (this is) just a big morale boost whenever you get a win like this.\u201d\n\nThe Pistons have dropped three straight to fall to 4-3.\n\n\u201cWhen we were 4-0 nobody was cheering for us and nobody is going to feel sorry for us when we lose three in a row,\u201d Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a situation where we have each other.

Brooklyn ended up outscoring the Pistons 33-27 in the fourth quarter, with Dinwiddie hitting a 3-pointer with 32 seconds left to force overtime.\n\n\u201cThank God for Spencer Dinwiddie,\u201d Dudley said.\n\nTIP-INS:\n\nPistons: Reserve Jose Calderon\u2019s 3-pointer with a second left in the first half gave Detroit a 60-54 lead.

Backup big man Ed Davis had with 10 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nNOT PASSING THE BOARDS\n\nDuring his pregame press conference, Nets coach Kenny Atkinson bemoaned his team\u2019s performance on the glass in a 115-96 loss to the New York Knicks on Monday night. In the loss to their crosstown rivals, the Nets were out rebounded 53-32. And Atkinson focused on his guards, who combined for eight rebounds. \u201cA lot of times our bigs are locked in or boxing out a big, and our guards are not pursuing the ball like they should.\u201d Against the Pistons, Nets guards had 18 rebounds.\n\nMIDDLE OF THE ROAD\n\nHistorically, defense and the Detroit Pistons have been synonymous terms. Through seven games of the Casey Era, Detroit is in the middle of the pack defensively, allowing 111.3 points per game. Offensively, they entered the game scoring 109.7 points per game. \u201cIn today\u2019s NBA, scoring is at a premium,\u201d Casey said before the game. \u201cThe pace is way up. Teams attempting the 3 is way up, so I would say scoring offensively is huge.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPistons: At Philadelphia on Saturday.\n\nNets: Host Houston on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Woman who locked a child in basement wants to visit children\n\nWAUKEGAN, Ill.

That forced the Brazilian side to win by three goals to qualify.\n\nPalmeiras leveled after halftime through Luan, and raised hopes when Gustavo Gomes converted a penalty eight minutes later.\n\nBut 10 minutes later, Dario Benedetto came off the bench again and scored again to snuff out Palmeiras\u2019 comeback. The striker scored both Boca goals at La Bombonera in the first leg.\n\nPalmeiras coach Luiz Felipe Scolari complimented Boca: \u201cI liked Boca\u2019s teamwork very much.\u201d\n\nPalmeiras\u2019 loss is ironic. Reserves of the Brazilian side beat Colombia\u2019s Junior Barranquilla 3-1 in May, allowing Boca to advance as runner-up in Group 8. Scolari wasn\u2019t in charge then.

But a new report suggests there\u2019s little chance that abused women in the North will get to say \u201cMeToo\u201d anytime soon.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s extremely patriarchal society means many women feel powerless to demand accountability over sexual violence, many are also ashamed of being abused, and some choose to keep silent because of flimsy law enforcement and support systems, according to a report published Thursday by New York-based Human Rights Watch based on interviews with 106 North Koreans who left the country, more than half of them after 2011.\n\nThree women who left North Korea and three South Korean experts, separately interviewed by The Associated Press, agreed that sexual violence is a serious problem in the North, though the voices and economic power of women have gradually increased in recent years because of their role in burgeoning capitalist-style markets. Some said that North Korean women didn\u2019t even understand that widespread assaults and harassment were abuse.\n\n\u201cSexual violence in North Korea is an open, unaddressed and widely tolerated secret,\u201d Kenneth Roth, Human Rights Watch\u2019s executive director, said in a statement. \u201cNorth Korean woman would probably say \u2018MeToo\u2019 if they thought there was any way to obtain justice, but their voices are silenced in Kim Jong Un\u2019s dictatorship.\u201d\n\nThe report comes as U.S.-led global diplomacy focuses on North Korean nuclear disarmament. The country\u2019s abysmal human rights status, however, has been largely ignored. It\u2019s not the first outside documentation of sexual violence in North Korea, but the report will likely anger North Korea, which often complains about what it claims is persistent U.S. hostility.\n\nKim\u2019s propaganda service has called North Korea a \u201csocialist paradise\u201d and bristles at outside criticism of its rights conditions as a U.S.-led attempt to force regime change. A 2016 dispatch said every woman in the North is \u201chighly valued and respected\u201d and that they \u201call can lead a worthwhile life as a heroine of the times.\u201d But this is also the country that called former female South Korean President Park Geun-hye a \u201cprostitute.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, titled \u201cYou Cry at Night but Don\u2019t Know Why,\u201d and the six people reached by the AP, sexual violence targeting women is rampant in North Korea. They say it happens in detention facilities, open markets, checkpoints, trains, streets and army bases.\n\nThe report details sexual abuse by men in official positions of power, such as prison guards, police officers, prosecutors, soldiers and market supervisors.\n\n\u201cInterviewees told us that when a guard or police officer \u2018picks\u2019 a woman, she has no choice but to comply with any demands he makes, whether for sex, money, or other favors,\u201d the report said. \u201cWomen in custody have little choice should they attempt to refuse or complain afterward, and risk sexual violence, longer periods in detention, beatings, forced labor, or increased scrutiny while conducting market activities.\u201d\n\nOne woman interviewed in the report said a police agent penetrated her several times with his fingers while questioning her illegal stay in China. Another talked about women in a detention center being forced to leave with a guard who raped them every night. They said that \u201cclick, click, click was the most horrible sound\u201d because it meant the key was turning in the door of their prison cells. Several traders also described male officials at checkpoints conducting intrusive body searches of young women, spending more time checking around their breasts and hips and sometimes underneath their underwear.\n\nOthers in the report said police don\u2019t consider sexual violence a \u201cserious crime\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201calmost inconceivable\u201d to even consider going to the police to report their suffering because of possible repercussions. A pervasive social stigma keeps victims silent, the report said, adding that all of the interviewees described \u201cwidespread impunity for perpetrators of sexual violence and lack of justice for survivors.\u201d They also spoke of deeply embedded patterns of discrimination against women, corruption and a lack of support mechanisms.\n\nWomen who talked to the AP said they didn\u2019t even know what exactly sexual abuse was when they were in North Korea.\n\n\u201cHigher-level male (army officers) often patted female soldiers on their hips and breasts or put their hands underneath their uniforms around their necks when they passed by them. We saw these things lots of times, but we just thought they were specially favored by our bosses,\u201d said Lee So Yeon, a woman who served in the North\u2019s army before her 2008 escape.\n\nA second woman said a detention center guard tried to rape her but moved away after she said her body was crawling with lice. A third woman said sexual abuse was considered shameful for women because people thought they must have brought it on themselves.\n\nThe Human Rights Watch report comes as North Korea struggles to win political and economic concessions from the United States in nuclear negotiations. It\u2019s unlikely that the North will take any major steps toward improving its rights conditions because U.S. and South Korean officials don\u2019t plan to openly raise the issue during the nuclear talks anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWhen we think about the North\u2019s horrible rights conditions, I know we should tackle that issue right away but it\u2019s also something that we can\u2019t resolve overnight,\u201d said analyst Cho Han Bum at Seoul\u2019s Korea Institute for National Unification.

A tough path to the final has only heightened expectations.\n\nTwo J-League teams, Urawa Reds (2017, 2007) and Gamba Osaka (2008), have won the continental championship in its current format.\n\nKashima\u2019s best result so far was a trip to the quarterfinals in 2008, when it lost 2-1 on aggregate against Australia\u2019s Adelaide United.\n\nKashima has shown resilience in advancing to the finals this time, rallying from two goals down in both legs of the semifinals against South Korea\u2019s Suwon Bluewings.\n\n\u201cNot just in the semifinals, but throughout the past year we\u2019ve had many tough matches,\u201d said Kashima midfielder Shoma Doi, who was part of the lineup that came back from 2-0 and 3-1 deficits in the games against Suwon.\n\nBrazilian midfielder Serginho struck a late equalizer to give Kashima a 3-3 draw in the Oct. 24 second leg, giving the Japanese club a 6-5 win on aggregate.\n\n\u201cNo matter the situation, we have great belief in what we\u2019ve been able to do,\u201d Doi said.\n\nPersepolis, meanwhile, will be aiming to become the first Iranian team to win the title and will rely heavily on captain Jalal Hosseini, who has represented four different clubs in the continental competition.\n\nPersepolis beat Qatar\u2019s Al Sadd 2-1 on aggregate in the semifinals.\n\nHosseini\u2019s late strike in the second leg of the Round of 16 clash against Al Jazira earned Persepolis an away-goals triumph, before the 36-year-old defender added another crucial goal in the quarterfinals against Al Duhail to start a stunning comeback from 2-0 down to win 3-2.\n\nThe second leg of the final is Nov. 10 at Azadi Stadium in Tehran.\n\nSeveral hundred international delegates and guests are expected to attend, raising the possibility of cultural tensions.\n\nWomen have been mainly prohibited from attending men\u2019s games and other sports events in Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "", "", "", "", "", "1 of 2 ARCHIVO - En esta foto de archivo del domingo 21 de octubre de 2018, los defensive ends de los Jaguars de Jacksonville, Dante Fowler (56) y Yannick Ngakoue (91), right, capturan al quarterback de los Texans de Houston, Deshaun Watson (4), durante la primera mitad de un partido de la NFL, en Jacksonville, Florida.

(AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Rams\u2019 top defenders reacted with predictable glee when they heard about the addition of pass-rusher Dante Fowler through a trade with Jacksonville.\n\n\u201cI found out about it, and I was smiling ear to ear,\u201d defensive tackle Aaron Donald said Wednesday.\n\nThe unbeaten Rams\u2019 next opponents \u2014 the New Orleans Saints \u2014 also reacted as you might expect to LA\u2019s big addition ahead of their NFC showdown at the Superdome.\n\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t have waited a week?\u201d quarterback Drew Brees asked lightheartedly. \u201cHe obviously adds some juice to that D-line that\u2019s already really stout.\u201d\n\nFowler passed his physical and went through the Rams\u2019 typically light Wednesday workout at their training complex. In between cram sessions on the Rams\u2019 defensive setup, he spent part of the afternoon in the locker room just talking with his new teammates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new chapter, that\u2019s how I look at it,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fresh start, just being able to start over and show guys who I really am.\u201d\n\nFowler will play for the Rams as a linebacker, which he considers his \u201cnatural position.\u201d He is hoping to be more of an every-down contributor than he was in Jacksonville, and he is eager to see what he can do on the rush when defenses must account for Donald, Ndamukong Suh and him on the same passing plays.\n\n\u2033(I want) to go in there, being the extra piece and just contributing to this great defense and to be a part of this special season,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cI\u2019m ready to come in here and do what I\u2019ve got to do to get us where we want to go. ... (Donald is the) best defensive tackle in the league, and Ndamukong Suh is a dominant defensive tackle. Shouldn\u2019t be no reason, when I do have my one-on-ones, I\u2019ve just got to make the most out of them.\u201d\n\nThe Rams want to go to the Super Bowl, and they\u2019re expected to be a strong contender after the franchise\u2019s first 8-0 start since 1969.\n\nFowler has a major advantage in playoff experience over most of his new teammates: The Jaguars reached the AFC championship game last season, winning two playoff games along the way before losing to New England. The Rams made the playoffs last season for the first time since the 2004 seasons, and they lost their only postseason game to Atlanta.\n\n\u201cI was on a really good team last year,\u201d said Fowler, who had two sacks in the conference title game. \u201cSo it\u2019s giving me a little drive, making me really excited, because I already know the way (to prepare) to be a championship team, and I\u2019m ready for it.\u201d\n\nFowler already has one friend on the Rams\u2019 defense: Dominique Easley, LA\u2019s injured veteran lineman and linebacker, was Fowler\u2019s host at the University of Florida when he was choosing a college. Fowler called him \u201cmy big brother.\u201d\n\nCoach Sean McVay isn\u2019t sure how much Fowler will play against the Saints (6-1), but the former first-round pick\u2019s arrival added another dimension to an already solid defense.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate him being able to be involved, and we\u2019ll see how he\u2019s able to adjust, how he\u2019s able to absorb that information,\u201d McVay said. \u201cWe wanted to get him in here, and (we\u2019re) hopeful that he\u2019s a contributor for us as soon as this weekend against a tough team.\u201d\n\nNOTES\n\nMcVay still anticipates the return of WR Cooper Kupp from a two-game absence with a knee injury. Kupp was limited in practice Wednesday, but the Rams typically don\u2019t do much physical work on Wednesdays. ... LB Trevon Young was the only other Rams player on the injury report. He was limited with his back injury. ... The Rams intend to lean on center Brian Allen and rookie Joseph Noteboom as their backup offensive linemen after the loss of Jamon Brown, who was released to make room for Fowler. \u201cWhat a class act,\u201d McVay said of Brown. \u201cCouldn\u2019t have been more impressed with just the way that he handled a tough, difficult discussion. There\u2019s always the human element that I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever be OK with. That\u2019s what\u2019s tough for us, for me as a coach, is when you\u2019ve got to look somebody in the eye who\u2019s been nothing but a class act, a great teammate, instrumental in being able to win a division last year.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Brett Martel in New Orleans contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.apnews.com/NFL and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "CASPER, Wyo.

Moon also said he expects Kim to visit Russia soon and that Kim may meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nMoon has previously said that Kim told him he would visit Seoul within this year when the leaders met in Pyongyang, North Korea\u2019s capital, in September.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s presidential office said it had nothing to add to Moon\u2019s speech about Kim\u2019s trip. His comments were in line with previous statements, it said. They suggest that Moon is determined to push ahead with diplomacy to resolve the nuclear issue.\n\n\u201cNow, based on firm trust among one another, South and North Korea and the United States will achieve complete denuclearization and lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d Moon said. \u201cThis is an opportunity that has come like a miracle. It\u2019s something that we should never miss.\u201d\n\nThe prospects for a second summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump improved after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made his fourth visit to North Korea last month. But no breakthrough has followed. U.S. officials have recently said a second Trump-Kim summit will likely happen early next year. Some experts have raised doubts over whether Kim\u2019s Seoul trip will occur by December.\n\nMoon, a liberal who took office last year, favors a negotiated resolution to the decades-long international standoff over North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions. He has facilitated a series of high-level U.S.-North Korea exchanges, including their first summit in Singapore in June.\n\nBut Moon has faced growing outside skepticism over whether his engagement policy will eventually settle the nuclear standoff. Many conservatives in South Korea and the United States say North Korea has no intention of fully giving up its nuclear program and only wants to buy time to perfect its weapons.\n\nSince entering nuclear talks earlier this year, North Korea has halted nuclear and missile tests and dismantled its nuclear testing site. The United States suspended some annual military drills with South Korea, but is reluctant to provide North Korea with big political or economic benefits unless it takes more serious disarmament steps.\n\nThe two Korea have also been taking steps to reduce conventional military threats along their border as part of deals struck during an inter-Korean summit in September. Seoul officials said the rivals on Thursday put covers on their naval and coastal artillery guns and closed gun ports along their disputed western sea boundary, the scene of several bloody maritime skirmishes between the countries in recent years.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s military said the two Koreas halted all hostile acts against each other along the land, sea and aerial boundaries as of Thursday. The Koreas have already removed weapons from a shared border village and have begun clearing mines at another border area where they plan their first searches for Korean War dead.\n\nThe two Koreas have remained split along the world\u2019s most heavily fortified border since the three-year Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice, not a peace treaty. If Kim, a third-generation hereditary ruler, visits Seoul, he would be the first North Korean leader to do so since the war\u2019s end.

The Defense Ministry's local branch said an early stage of landfill work at Henoko on Okinawa's east coast began Thursday morning.(Koji Harada/Kyodo News via AP)\n\nTOKYO (AP) \u2014 Japan\u2019s central government resumed work at a disputed U.S. military base relocation site on Thursday even though Okinawa residents overwhelmingly see the project as an undemocratic imposition on the small southern island.\n\nThe initial stage of landfill work at Henoko on Okinawa\u2019s east coast resumed Thursday morning, following the central government\u2019s decision this week to reverse Okinawa\u2019s earlier ban on landfill work at the site, said Satoshi Shirakata, a spokesman at the Okinawa Defense Bureau overseeing the project.\n\nConstruction workers were setting up floats using a crane to mark the designated landfill area, making it off-limits to the public, Shirakata said. Opponents gathered in paddle boats nearby, while Coast Guard patrol boats blocked them from reaching the site, and dozens of other demonstrators rallied outside a nearby U.S. base to protest.\n\nOkinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki said it was \u201cextremely regrettable\u201d the central government forced its way just weeks after he proposed dialogue with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other officials in Tokyo. He said he was seeking another meeting with Abe.\n\nTamaki also said Okinawa was considering taking the case to a government-commissioned arbitration committee of outside experts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely regrettable,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI will consistently urge the central government to sincerely listen to Okinawa\u2019s voice and take a democratic stance by seeking a settlement through dialogue but not by bulldozing the construction.\u201d\n\nAt the center of contention is a decades-old plan to move a Marine Corps air station from densely populated Futenma in the southern part of the island to less-crowded Henoko on the east coast.\n\nMany Okinawans say the presence of so many U.S. troops on the island is burdensome already and they want the existing Futenma air station closed and its replacement moved off the island entirely.\n\nTamaki, who took office a month ago, has urged Abe and other top officials to stop the Henoko plan and reduce Okinawa\u2019s burdens.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, Tamaki said the central government was not giving due consideration to other options.\n\n\u201cThey say Henoko is the only one, Henoko is the only solution. But we think that it is definitely not the case and that they\u2019re refusing to think critically,\u201d the governor said. \u201cThe American side has made multiple proposals under reorganization plans and the Japanese government should consider them.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s position is that the dispute should be resolved between Tokyo and Okinawa. Tamaki told the AP he will travel to the U.S. later this month to gain support from Americans on the issue. He said both Japan and the U.S. should listen to the voice of Okinawans.\n\nTamaki was elected on his campaign promises to block the Henoko base and further reduce U.S. bases on the island. He is the first person with an American parent to lead the island, which was occupied by the U.S. longer than the rest of Japan after World War II. He said he wants to encourage dialogue and bridge the gap on the issue.\n\nThe work begun Thursday is preparation for a coastal embankment to be built at the bay ahead of full-fledged landfill work. When completed, the air station will include land reclaimed from Henoko Bay.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular news conference that the timing of sediment filling has not been decided. The Defense Ministry says the base with planned V-shape runways is set to complete in 2022.\n\nOkinawan officials have filed injunction requests to stop the process in the past. Such filings could temporarily stop the work but are overturned as the central government\u2019s decisions take precedence.\n\nThe relocation of Futenma air station was planned after the 1995 rape of a schoolgirl in which three U.S. servicemen were convicted.

He was 80.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants announced McCovey\u2019s death, saying the fearsome hitter passed \u201cpeacefully\u201d on Wednesday afternoon \u201cafter losing his battle with ongoing health issues.\u201d\n\nA first baseman and left fielder, McCovey was a .270 career hitter with 521 home runs and 1,555 RBIs in 22 major league seasons, 19 of them with the Giants. He also played for the Athletics and Padres.\n\nMcCovey made his major league debut at 21 on July 30, 1959, and played alongside the other Willie \u2014 Hall of Famer Willie Mays \u2014 into the 1972 season before Mays was traded to the New York Mets.\n\nMcCovey batted .354 with 13 homers and 38 RBIs on the way to winning the 1959 NL Rookie of the Year award. The six-time All-Star also won the 1969 NL MVP and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1986 after his first time on the ballot.\n\n\u201cYou knew right away he wasn\u2019t an ordinary ballplayer,\u201d Hall of Famer Hank Aaron said, courtesy of the Hall of Fame. \u201cHe was so strong, and he had the gift of knowing the strike zone. There\u2019s no telling how many home runs he would have hit if those knees weren\u2019t bothering him all the time and if he played in a park other than Candlestick.\u201d\n\nMcCovey had been getting around in a wheelchair in recent years because he could no longer rely on his once-dependable legs, yet was still regularly seen at the ballpark in his private suite. McCovey had attended games at AT&T Park as recently as the season finale.\n\n\u201cI love him so much. It\u2019s a very sad day for me. We were very close,\u201d Hall of Famer Orlando Cepeda said in a telephone interview. \u201cWillie McCovey was not only a great ballplayer but a great teammate. He didn\u2019t have any fear. He never complained.\n\n\u201cI remember one time in 1960 they sent him down to the minor leagues after being Rookie of the Year the year before. He didn\u2019t complain. He was very polite, he was very quiet. He was a great man, a great friend. I\u2019m going to miss him so much. He didn\u2019t say a bad word about anybody.\u201d\n\nWhile the Giants captured their third World Series title of the decade in 2014, McCovey returned to watch them play while still recovering from an infection that hospitalized him that September for about a month.\n\nHe attended one game at AT&T Park during both the NL Championship Series and World Series. He even waited for the team at the end of the parade route inside San Francisco\u2019s Civic Center.\n\n\u201cIt was touch and go for a while,\u201d McCovey said at the time. \u201cThey pulled me through, and I\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d\n\nMcCovey had been thrilled the Giants accomplished something he didn\u2019t during a decorated career in the major leagues.\n\nEven four-plus decades later, it still stung for the left-handed slugging \u201cBig Mac\u201d that he never won a World Series after coming so close. The Giants lost the 1962 World Series to the New York Yankees.\n\nHe often thought about that World Series, and it remained difficult to accept. The Giants lost 1-0 in Game 7 when McCovey lined out to second baseman Bobby Richardson with runners on second and third for the final out.\n\n\u201cI still think about it all the time. I still think, \u2018If I could have hit it a little more,\u2019\u201d he said on Oct. 31, 2014.\n\nIn 2012, he said: \u201cI think about the line drive, yes. Can\u2019t get away from it.\u201d\n\nMcCovey narrowly beat out Mets pitcher Tom Seaver for the 1969 MVP award. McCovey led the NL in home runs (45) and RBIs (126) for the second straight year, batting .320 while also posting NL bests with a .453 on-base percentage and .656 slugging percentage. He was walked 121 times, then drew a career-high 137 free passes the next season.\n\nHe had been third in the \u201968 voting for NL MVP, but after 1969 would never again finish higher than ninth.\n\nMcCovey and Ted Williams before him were among the first players to really face infield shifts as opponents tried to affect his rhythm at the plate.\n\nOn Wednesday night, former teammate Felipe Alou recalled inviting McCovey to play winter ball with him in 1958 for Escogido in Alou\u2019s native Dominican Republic.\n\nMcCovey got homesick, so a still-single Alou moved out of his parents\u2019 home and into an apartment with his dear friend and teammate. They were roommates in the minors and majors, too. McCovey called Alou \u201cRojas,\u201d his father\u2019s last name. Alou called him \u201cWillie Lee,\u201d McCovey\u2019s middle name.\n\n\u201cWe had a great relationship. Incredible friend and player and individual,\u201d Alou said. \u201cI have so many good memories.\u201d\n\nMcCovey was born on Jan. 10, 1938, in Mobile, Alabama. He had spent the last 18 years in a senior advisory role for the Giants.\n\n\u201cFor more than six decades, he gave his heart and soul to the Giants,\u201d team president and CEO Larry Baer said. \u201cAs one of the greatest players of all time, as a quiet leader in the clubhouse, as a mentor to the Giants who followed in his footsteps, as an inspiration to our Junior Giants, and as a fan cheering on the team from his booth.\u201d\n\nSaid McCovey\u2019s wife, Estela, whom he married this summer: \u201cEvery moment he will be terribly missed. He was my best friend and husband. Living life without him will never be the same.\u201d\n\nMcCovey had a daughter, Allison, and three grandchildren, Raven, Philip, and Marissa. McCovey also is survived by sister Frances and brothers Clauzell and Cleon.\n\nMcCovey said that 2010 victory, when the Giants won the franchise\u2019s first World Series championship since moving from New York in 1958, helped eased the pain for players like him, Juan Marichal, Mays and Alou. Seeing San Francisco in the Fall Classic again brought those smiles back to McCovey\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of getting spoiled,\u201d he said in 2012. \u201cThis is two in three years. People don\u2019t realize how hard it is to get here. We\u2019ve been pretty lucky.\u201d\n\nMcCovey presented the \u201cWillie Mac Award\u201d each season \u2014 except in 2014 while dealing with complications from the infection \u2014 an honor voted on by the players, coaches and training staff to recognize the team\u2019s player most exhibiting McCovey\u2019s inspirational example both on the field and in the clubhouse. He was there this year as reliever Will Smith was honored.\n\n\u201cSomething I will cherish forever,\u201d Smith wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. \u201cMay he Rest In Peace.\u201d\n\nWhen San Francisco opened its new waterfront ballpark in 2000, the cove beyond the right-field fence was named \u201cMcCovey Cove\u201d in appreciation of all he did for the organization. There\u2019s a statue of McCovey\u2019s likeness on the other side of the water from where those splash hits land.\n\n\u201cWillie McCovey was one of our game\u2019s greatest power hitters. He won the National League MVP in 1969 and, alongside fellow Hall of Famer and Alabama native Willie Mays, was a key part of many memorable Giants\u2019 teams,\u201d Commissioner Rob Manfred said. \u201cFor 22 years on the field and many more after retiring, Willie was a superb ambassador for the Giants and our game.\u201d\n\nThe Giants said a public celebration of McCovey\u2019s life would be held at a later date.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Come see forests and peaks, but clean up, New Zealand says\n\nIn this Oct. 6, 2018 photo a tourist stands on a rock as he looks over Lake Tekapo and the Southern Alps in New Zealand.

Kelly\u2019s campaign declined Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2018, to comment on Kobach\u2019s comments. (Brian Hayes/The Wichita Eagle via AP, File)\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Republican candidate Kris Kobach on Wednesday echoed President Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that Trump can deny U.S. citizenship to babies born to parents living in the country illegally, intensifying a focus on immigration in the final days of a close Kansas governor\u2019s race.\n\nKobach, the Kansas secretary of state, is Trump\u2019s biggest political ally in the state and has advised the White House on homeland security issues. He also has made pursuing tough state measures against illegal immigration a cornerstone of his campaign for governor.\n\nBut in backing Trump on whether the president can end birthright citizenship without an amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Kobach broke with some fellow Republicans, including U.S House Speaker Paul Ryan. Like Trump, Kobach contradicted legal experts who see the issue as long-settled and clear under the Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the interesting things about birthright citizenship. There are many people who are under the misimpression that the 14th Amendment commands it,\u201d Kobach said during a Fox News television interview . \u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe added that Congress could end birthright citizenship or, \u201cThe president could do it through a regulation.\u201d\n\nKobach is in a toss-up race with Democrat Laura Kelly, a veteran state senator from Topeka. She has argued that combating illegal immigration requires comprehensive legislation from Congress and that Kobach\u2019s get-tough approach would damage the state\u2019s economy, particularly in western Kansas and when it comes to agriculture.\n\nKelly\u2019s campaign declined Wednesday to comment on Kobach\u2019s comments. But Ethan Corson, the Kansas Democratic Party\u2019s executive director said: \u201cAs Republicans like Paul Ryan and legal scholars from across the political spectrum have stated, the president obviously has no authority to alter the Constitution by executive order.\u201d\n\nPatrick Miller, a University of Kansas political scientist, said Kobach needs his conservative base to turn out to defeat Kelly. He said raising birthright citizenship as an issue after it\u2019s remained relatively neglected represents \u201ca fresher angle\u201d on immigration issues.\n\n\u201cIf you want to kick life into some kind of advertising, whether you\u2019re selling a candidate or toothpaste, having a fresh angle is sometimes good to reignite interest and engagement,\u201d Miller said. \u201cKobach also likes to push the envelope on a lot of things.\u201d\n\nThe 14th Amendment begins: \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d\n\nKobach, an attorney and former law school professor, argued Wednesday on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that immigrants living in the country illegally are not under U.S. jurisdiction, allowing Trump or Congress to deny their U.S-born children automatic citizenship. But a move in line with that thinking would likely spark a legal challenge.\n\nStates ratified the 14th Amendment after the Civil War to secure U.S. citizenship for newly freed black slaves. It later was used to guarantee citizenship to all babies born on U.S. soil after court challenges, including one that led to an 1898 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nTrump said in an interview Tuesday that he wants to end birthright citizenship and could do so with an executive order. Ryan responded in a radio interview, saying: \u201cWell you obviously cannot do that.\u201d That drew a tweeted rebuke from the president.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments also were an issue in a debate Tuesday between Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder and Democratic challenger Sharice Davids in Kansas\u2019 3rd Congressional District, where immigration has been a major issue. Trump, who narrowly lost the Kansas City-area district in 2016, has endorsed Yoder, the chairman of a House subcommittee on homeland security.\n\nDuring the debate, neither candidate said directly whether they would support an effort by Congress to end birthright citizenship, though Davids said an executive order by Trump would \u201cviolate our Constitution.\u201d\n\nWhen asked after the debate about ending birthright citizenship, Yoder told reporters that if the U.S. secured its borders adequately, \u201cThat\u2019s not an issue then.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow John Hanna on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apjdhanna .", "New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees runs from Minnesota Vikings defensive end Danielle Hunter, right, during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Oct. 28, 2018, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Bruce Kluckhohn)\n\nMETAIRIE, La. (AP) \u2014 Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints face an unusual challenge this weekend.\n\nThey\u2019ll try to keep up with an offense every bit as potent as their own \u2014 and do so against one of the top-rated defenses in the NFL.\n\nSaints coach Sean Payton said dealing with the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 eighth-ranked defense will be a tall order in itself.\n\n\u201cIt presents a ton of problems,\u201d Payton said. \u201cFirst off, the talent when you\u2019re talking about some of the top tackles and ends in the business \u2014 that that in itself is difficult. And then when you put it with an outstanding scheme, then you really have a challenge.\u201d\n\nBrees said Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh comprise the best interior defensive line he\u2019s faced since he was at Purdue and played a Georgia team fielding Marcus Stroud and Richard Seymour in the 2000 Outback Bowl (Georgia won, 28-25).\n\n\u201cAt this level, it\u2019s really unheard of to have Suh and Donald in there,\u201d Brees said. \u201cThose guys are unbelievable.\u201d\n\nDonald and Suh have combined for 13 sacks, with Donald getting 10.\n\nThe Saints so far have held up well against the pass rush. Brees has been sacked nine times and generally has had enough time to make accurate throws. He was intercepted for the first time Sunday night in Minnesota when an edge-rusher was unblocked and closing quickly on him.\n\nOffensively, New Orleans ranks eighth in yards per game and second in points per game at 33.4. Brees\u2019 passing numbers have gone down lately, but more because of New Orleans\u2019 ability to run the ball more and control the clock with Mark Ingram returning from his four-game suspension.\n\nThe Saints are 3-0 since Ingram\u2019s return and have won six straight overall after losing to Tampa Bay in the season opener.\n\nBut the unbeaten Rams rank second offensively in yards per game (442.6) and have averaged 33 points, which rank third.\n\nBrees sees similarities between the Saints when he and Sean Payton first joined forces 13 seasons ago, and the Rams under 32-year-old offensive-minded head coach Sean McVay and 24-year-old Jared Goff, the 2016 top overall draft choice.\n\n\u201cWe like to feel like over the last 13 years that we\u2019ve kind of been at the forefront of offensive football ... taking the personnel that you have and being able to utilize it in some really unique ways,\u201d Brees said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t help but turn on the film and be intrigued by the things that they\u2019re doing. Obviously, I think Jared Goff is playing as well as anybody right now. He\u2019s got a bunch of weapons there at the receiver position that are lighting it up, Todd Gurley, one of the best backs in the league.\u201d\n\nBrees said that while he doesn\u2019t know McVay well, he said the Rams coach\u2019s youthful energy, enthusiasm and offensive background remind him of Payton to some extent, starting with the fact they both played quarterback in college and had offensive backgrounds as NFL assistants before their first head coaching jobs.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen from his offenses and what I hear about him is there\u2019s a lot of those same traits, and it makes it really, really fun to play for a guy like that, because it makes it exciting and it gives you a ton of confidence,\u201d Brees said.\n\nBrees also said it is apparent that the pairing of McVay with Goff \u201cwas a great match.\u201d\n\nSaints defensive end Cam Jordan said his unit should be confident in its ability to slow Los Angeles if it plays largely mistake-free schematically and tackles well throughout, especially against Gurley.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re able to execute at a high level, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody on the field that can stop us. We have to be able to do that for all 60 minutes though,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nNotes: Saints rookie defensive end Marcus Davenport missed practice because of a toe injury. He did not confirm reports that he would be out for about a month, saying he\u2019s seeking multiple opinions and hasn\u2019t ruled out playing against the Rams on Sunday. He played with the injury at Minnesota, where he had two sacks, giving him a total of four through his first seven NFL games. The injury occurred during his sack of the Vikings\u2019 Kirk Cousins in the third quarter. Davenport said he had to play differently afterward, and tried to \u201cnot think about it and just go out there and try to ball and take as many chances as I could.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.apnews.com/tags/NFL and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "President Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Estero, Fla., Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2018.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)\n\nHAMPTON, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Rep. Steve King is keeping a low profile.\n\nEngulfed in controversy for his past support of white supremacist groups and leaders in light of Saturday\u2019s massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue, the Iowa Republican is riding out the closing days of a re-election campaign whose success is suddenly in question.\n\nKing has no campaign events scheduled and his staff has stopped responding to inquiries. His public appearances have been limited to friendly territory, such as the Crawford County Republican Party fundraiser Sunday.\n\nDemocrats are already hoping to flip two of Iowa\u2019s four congressional seats, and the turmoil surrounding King has them thinking they could take his seat as well. It\u2019s a tough task in a district that President Donald Trump won by 27 percentage points. But even some Republicans acknowledge King is in for a tough challenge from Democratic challenger J.D. Scholten.\n\n\u201cThis is the strongest competition he\u2019s ever faced,\u201d said Gwen Ecklund, a former GOP chairwoman in Crawford County, one of 39 counties in the vastly agricultural district that stretches from most of the Minnesota border west to the Missouri River. \u201cBut I think the stronghold of his support remains intact.\u201d\n\nThat premise has been challenged in recent days, as King has come under fire from House GOP leadership for tweets he\u2019s posted endorsing a white nationalist candidate for Toronto mayor, and praising a nationalist party in Austria with Nazi ties.\n\nThe comments were the latest in a long line from the 69-year-old congressman lamenting the rise of minorities as a threat to white Americans, along with anti-immigrant and anti-Islamic comments over the years.\n\nNot until Tuesday, in the days after the Pittsburgh shooting, did National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Steve Stivers decry King\u2019s comments. That day, longtime King financial backers Land O\u2019Lakes, a Minnesota-based food company, and its subsidiary Purina Pet Care, both with plants in King\u2019s district, withdrew their support from King, as did the microprocessor company Intel.\n\nIn Iowa, however, Republicans have been silent.\n\nRepublican Gov.

Steve King is keeping a low profile.\n\nEngulfed in controversy for his past support of white supremacist groups and leaders in light of Saturday\u2019s massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue, the Iowa Republican is riding out the closing days of a re-election campaign whose success is suddenly in question.\n\nKing has no campaign events scheduled and his staff has stopped responding to inquiries. His public appearances have been limited to friendly territory, such as the Crawford County Republican Party fundraiser Sunday.\n\nDemocrats are already hoping to flip two of Iowa\u2019s four congressional seats, and the turmoil surrounding King has them thinking they could take his seat as well. It\u2019s a tough task in a district that President Donald Trump won by 27 percentage points. But even some Republicans acknowledge King is in for a tough challenge from Democratic challenger J.D. Scholten.\n\n\u201cThis is the strongest competition he\u2019s ever faced,\u201d said Gwen Ecklund, a former GOP chairwoman in Crawford County, one of 39 counties in the vastly agricultural district that stretches from most of the Minnesota border west to the Missouri River. \u201cBut I think the stronghold of his support remains intact.\u201d\n\nThat premise has been challenged in recent days, as King has come under fire from House GOP leadership for tweets he\u2019s posted endorsing a white nationalist candidate for Toronto mayor, and praising a nationalist party in Austria with Nazi ties.\n\nThe comments were the latest in a long line from the 69-year-old congressman lamenting the rise of minorities as a threat to white Americans, along with anti-immigrant and anti-Islamic comments over the years.\n\nNot until Tuesday, in the days after the Pittsburgh shooting, did National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Steve Stivers decry King\u2019s comments. That day, longtime King financial backers Land O\u2019Lakes, a Minnesota-based food company, and its subsidiary Purina Pet Care, both with plants in King\u2019s district, withdrew their support from King, as did the microprocessor company Intel.\n\nIn Iowa, however, Republicans have been silent.\n\nRepublican Gov.

(AP Photo/Adrian Kraus)\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) \u2014 It didn\u2019t take Bill Belichick long to recall what Aaron Rodgers did against his defense the previous time that the Packers faced the Patriots.\n\n\u201cHe killed us,\u201d Belichick said of New England\u2019s 26-21 loss in Green Bay in 2014. \u201cHe does everything well. ... He\u2019s one of the great quarterbacks in the National Football League. No question about it.\u201d\n\nFour years later, not a lot has changed about Belichick\u2019s affinity for Rodgers or his abilities as the Patriots prepare to host Green Bay on Sunday night.\n\nIt presents the latest challenge for a New England defense that has had issues slowing teams down this season, particularly in the secondary.\n\nFollowing the departure of defensive coordinator Matt Patricia to the Lions, the Patriots have struggled with consistency in 2018.\n\nThey currently rank in the bottom half of the NFL in both total defense (25th, 383 yards per game) and passing yards allowed (22nd, 227 yards per game).\n\nStopping the pass was a major issue in both of New England\u2019s losses.\n\nBlake Bortles threw for 376 yards and four touchdowns, including a 61-yarder to Dede Westbrook in the fourth quarter of the Jaguars\u2019 31-20 win in Week 2.\n\nA week later, Matt Stafford had just nine incompletions and passed for 262 yards and two touchdowns in leading the Lions to a 26-10 victory.\n\nAnd though the Patriots were able to pull out a 43-40 win against the Chiefs, it came despite Patrick Mahomes lighting up the defense for 352 yards and four TDs through the air.\n\nThe similarities in all those games were the ability of the three quarterbacks to create time and space with their legs.\n\nRodgers isn\u2019t expected to be as mobile as he continues to be slowed by the knee injury he sustained in Green Bay\u2019s season opener. But he\u2019s still managed to complete 61 percent of his passes while throwing for 13 touchdowns and just one interception.\n\nPatriots cornerback Jason McCourty was with the Titans in 2016 when they beat the Packers 47-25 in a game that saw Rodgers throw two interceptions.\n\nBut he said he isn\u2019t counting on getting anything less than Rodgers\u2019 best this time around.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t want to compare anybody to Aaron Rodgers, so I won\u2019t go that route,\u201d McCourty said. \u201cAt the end of the day, however many football games you can play in preparation to help you get ready for this guy. ... He\u2019ll probably be the best quarterback we play against this year for sure.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Rodgers is expecting to see various defensive looks from Belichick to get him off his game.\n\n\u201cBill is a phenomenal coach and he\u2019s always going to have his guys ready to play,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do a number of different things \u2014 they don\u2019t just always major in one specific thing. They\u2019re going to try to combat what you do best and take it away and get you off schedule and lock down the guys they want to take away and make you beat them with your third and fourth options.\u201d\n\nNew England\u2019s secondary has shown improvement during its five-game win streak. Part of the reason is the support it has gotten up front from the defensive line.\n\nA week after giving up 31 points to Chicago, the Patriots responded by limiting Buffalo\u2019s offense to just six points on a day in which Tom Brady and his offense struggled.\n\nThe defense had three sacks, including two from linebacker Kyle Van Noy. But the play of the game came from safety Devin McCourty, who picked off Buffalo quarterback Derek Anderson late in the fourth quarter and returned it 84 yards for a touchdown.\n\nNew England\u2019s 11 interceptions are tied for the second-most in the league through eight weeks.\n\nDefensive end Trey Flowers said helping the secondary find similar success against Rodgers will hinge on their ability to speed up Rodgers in the pocket.\n\n\u201cWe definitely will need to try to contain him as much as we can,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cYou flush him out the pocket and he\u2019s still good. Keep him in the pocket and he\u2019s still great.

(Peru's Supreme Court communication office via AP)\n\nLIMA, Peru (AP) \u2014 Former Peruvian first daughter Keiko Fujimori was ordered back to jail Wednesday in a case that has captured attention in the South American nation reeling from a series of corruption scandals reaching into the highest echelons of power.\n\nJudge Richard Concepcion ruled the 43-year-old opposition leader should be detained as a preventative measure as prosecutors investigate allegations that she led a criminal network within her party that received about $1 million in illegal payments from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht.\n\nFujimori has denied taking any money from the company during her 2011 presidential run and has called the investigation a political witchhunt.\n\nIn a hearing that lasted over eight hours, Concepcion said he believed there was considerable proof to strongly suspect that Fujimori not only knew about the payments but had an active role in hiding the origin of the funds.\n\nAs Fujimori looked on, her arms crossed and her lips pursed into a frown for much of the afternoon, the judge recounted information presented by prosecutors describing her as the leader of a powerful organization who plotted so that others could commit crimes on her behalf.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, preventative prison is the only measure that applies,\u201d he concluded.\n\nConcepcion ordered her jailed for 36 months, a ruling her lawyer immediately vowed to appeal.\n\nThe attorney, Giulliana Loza, argued that the chief prosecutor\u2019s case relies overwhelmingly on a witness whose account cannot be corroborated and accused Concepcion of utilizing outside information not presented by authorities.\n\n\u201cIn this case we\u2019ve never had an impartial judge,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter the judge\u2019s ruling, Fujimori, who is still considered one of the most powerful people in Peru, was surrounded by a half dozen uniformed officers. Dressed in jeans in a long-sleeved black shirt, she showed no emotion as she exited the room.\n\nMany Peruvians thought the daughter of former strongman Alberto Fujimori would never see time behind bars in a country where corruption has long often gone unpunished.\n\nBut some of the nation\u2019s most prominent politicians, including four ex-presidents, are now under investigation or charged in connection with corruption probes, and thousands of angry citizens have taken to the streets to protest official graft. A referendum on toughening anti-corruption laws is scheduled for early December.\n\nKeiko Fujimori, who came within 50,000 votes of winning the 2016 presidential election, leads the opposition political party with a majority in congress but her influence has waned in recent months after Martin Vizcarra became president.\n\nFujimori has been a champion for her ailing 80-year-old father, who was pardoned by Vizcarra\u2019s predecessor last year from a 25-year jail sentence for human rights abuses during his decade-long rule. Peru\u2019s Supreme Court recently overturned the pardon and ordered him back behind bars.\n\nKeiko Fujimori had been detained in early October as a preventative measure while the money laundering investigation but was ordered released a week later.\n\nOdebrecht has admitted to paying $788 million in bribes to politicians throughout the region in exchange for lucrative public works contracts.", "San Francisco Giants say Hall of Fame slugger Willie McCovey has died at 80", "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Some businesses in Detroit\u2019s Corktown neighborhood have joined the city\u2019s Project Green Light commercial corridor program which uses high-definition exterior surveillance cameras to fight crime.\n\nThey join businesses in the Greektown entertainment district which joined the program earlier this year.
