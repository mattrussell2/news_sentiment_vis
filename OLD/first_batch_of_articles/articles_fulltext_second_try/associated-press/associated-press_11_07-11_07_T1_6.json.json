Franklin, File)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Farhan Zaidi understands the intrigue that stems from his unique baseball path: from the small-budget Oakland Athletics to the big-spending Los Angeles Dodgers and back to the Bay Area to join the rival Giants.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s new front-office whiz plans to incorporate plenty from the franchise\u2019s rich tradition by leaning on some of the entrenched baseball minds behind its success this decade, even if there are varying ideas about how to get the Giants back into playoff contention.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a convenient narrative to see this as kind of a clash of schools of thought. I just don\u2019t see it that way at all,\u201d the MIT-educated Zaidi said of mixing his analytics expertise with the old-school practices of veteran executive Brian Sabean and manager Bruce Bochy. \u201cObviously we didn\u2019t get to these points in our career the same way or in a similar way, but I think that\u2019s part of the beauty of the game, how we all wind up together and then pulling toward a common goal.\u201d\n\nFollowing four years as general manager of the Dodgers, Zaidi received a five-year contract to become Giants president of baseball operations Tuesday. He was formally introduced Wednesday at AT&T Park, then headed back to Southern California and the GM meetings in Carlsbad. He\u2019ll join up with San Francisco\u2019s front office on site \u2014 a trip Zaidi figures will bring some \u201cnormalcy\u201d back to his life after a whirlwind few days switching organizations.\n\nGiants CEO Larry Baer and Zaidi first met Friday for a planned two-hour session that carried on for 6 1/2 hours. Zaidi on Wednesday thanked the Dodgers for allowing him to pursue an opportunity with their NL West rival, saying \u201cI\u2019m incredibly gracious.\u201d\n\nAndrew Friedman, the Dodgers\u2019 president of baseball operations, said it would be fun competing against Zaidi.\n\nAt the GM meetings, Friedman said the Dodgers would miss Zaidi\u2019s \u201ccreativity, work ethic, ability to connect with people. He\u2019s extremely talented and somebody who\u2019s obviously made a huge impact for us the last four years.\u201d\n\nFriedman said he and Zaidi had conversations about the Giants\u2019 job during the last week. \u201cI kept telling him, obviously I\u2019m biased but I\u2019m trying to do everything I could to support him and be a sounding board and set my bias to the side.\u201d\n\nThe Dodgers didn\u2019t try to lure Zaidi back, Friedman said. \u201cNo, I mean that was the point. If this was something he wanted to pursue we were going to support him.\u201d\n\nThe next step for Zaidi is hiring a general manager and a farm director, something he hopes to do soon if the right candidate emerges.\n\nIt\u2019ll be a new direction for a franchise that won World Series championships in 2010, \u201912 and \u201914.\n\nZaidi\u2019s Dodgers reached the World Series the past two years without winning.\n\n\u201cThe response was just total heartbreak, I guess. I don\u2019t know how else you say it,\u201d he said.\n\nZaidi will spend the coming months learning more about a franchise he\u2019s watched closely for decades. He has already exchanged text messages with some core players, and he plans to visit a few this offseason. Zaidi\u2019s first baseball game came at Candlestick Park in 1987, so this feels like coming \u201cfull circle.\u201d\n\nZaidi earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in economics from MIT in 1998 and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California at Berkeley in 2011. He spent 10 years with the A\u2019s before joining Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cIt was quite compelling the way Farhan was able to put together winning franchises throughout,\u201d Baer said, noting he hopes Zaidi will lead the club decades into the future.\n\nSan Francisco went 73-89 during an injury-plagued 2018 with a major league-worst 5-21 record in September, missing the playoffs for a second straight year and third time in four seasons.\n\nZaidi has no plans of tackling a turnaround on his own. Sabean will stay directly involved, and Bochy is allowed the last word when it comes to on-field moves, including the lineup and rotation.\n\n\u201cAnything that is under the privy of the manager, the manager has final say \u2014 period. That is not even a question for me,\u201d Zaidi said.\n\nZaidi and Bochy spoke briefly already and will meet in person at some point. Bochy is scheduled to attend late Hall of Famer Willie McCovey\u2019s celebration of life Thursday at the ballpark after Zaidi is already back in the San Diego area.\n\nTo Bochy and Sabean, Zaidi expressed his interest in learning from both longtime, accomplished baseball men while bringing a fresh look, saying \u201cI see this as a collaborative process\u201d with \u201cideas flowing both ways.\u201d\n\nA message he kept coming back to Wednesday: \u201cOur goal is to play meaningful baseball as deep into the season and as soon as we can.\u201d\n\nTo do so, he will strive to make \u201cone good baseball move after another\u201d in building a winning roster.\n\n\u201cI think the theme that we had from a player-acquisition standpoint in particular was no move is too small to not be worth a certain level of effort and detail \u2014 waiver claims, minor league free agents, second or third players in trades,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of value to be had in identifying talent in those regards.\u201d\n\nOh, and don\u2019t rule out an A\u2019s-Giants trade with his former Oakland boss, Billy Beane.\n\n\u201cI think one of those could happen,\u201d Zaidi said, grinning.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Bernie Wilson contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "", "Republican Rep.

Already the only woman to have held the job, she would also become one of the few lawmakers to reclaim the gavel after losing it.\n\nPelosi is a \u201csmart woman,\u201d Trump said during a nearly 90-minute press conference at the White House, and someone with whom he hopes to engage in \u201cbeautiful bipartisanship\u201d and deal-making. It was a role reversal from just days ago, when he warned voters of her \u201cradical\u201d agenda. She \u201cdeserved\u201d to become speaker again after winning the House, Trump said Wednesday, adding that he looked forward to doing \u201ca tremendous amount of legislation\u201d once power in Congress is divided between a Democratic House and Republican Senate.\n\nAt the Capitol, in the stately Rayburn Room \u2014 named after the last speaker who returned to the office \u2014 Pelosi was asked if she was confident she would become speaker when the new Congress convenes in January. She said simply: \u201cYes, I am.\u201d\n\nYet ascent of the California Democrat is nowhere near guaranteed. Many younger House Democrats, including some of the newly elected, have pledged to vote against her. They are reluctant to shout the name \u201cPelosi\u201d when the cameras zoom in during the first roll call of Congress, fearful of the attack ads that will be launched against them.\n\nAs Trump and Pelosi extended overtures across Pennsylvania Avenue, they also shadowboxed around the new dynamic created by the House\u2019s ability to probe the president\u2019s business dealings and his administration. The president warned Democrats not to push too hard with their investigations, or he would smack back even harder; Pelosi vowed that they would conduct responsible oversight.\n\nThe two have reasons to cooperate. Both want to score legislative wins to bring to voters ahead of the 2020 election. They talked on election night about doing an infrastructure package and lowering health care costs, particularly around prescription drugs, priorities for both sides.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of opportunity,\u201d Pelosi said, noting she worked productively with President George W. Bush during her last turn as speaker. She also referenced Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California, another favorite Trump villain, who is set to lead the powerful Financial Services Committee.\n\n\u201cDemocrats come to this majority with the responsibility not to Democrats \u2014 it\u2019s not to Democrats or Republicans \u2014 it\u2019s to the United States of America,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact is we\u2019d like to work together.\u201d\n\nPelosi is likely to win first-round voting later this month to become leader, when she needs half of House Democrats to support her. But becoming speaker requires a majority of the full House, 218 votes, and her slim majority \u2014 now at 222 \u2014 leaves her little cushion.\n\nIt\u2019s not just her. Pelosi heads a trio of septuagenarian leaders, with Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer and Assistant Leader Jim Clyburn, who have held power since the last time Democrats took back the House majority, in 2006. Each is poised to move up a slot.\n\nDemocrats who want new leadership have been whispering about it for weeks, and on Wednesday, several Pelosi opponents announced their intent to run for the top posts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been saying for a long time that the Democratic Party leadership is in dire need of change,\u201d wrote Rep. Filemon Vela of Texas, one of two who wants to run for the No. 3 job of chief vote-counter. \u201cYa es tiempo de un cambio!\u201d he echoed his statement in Spanish.\n\nAnother Democrat, Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado, also jumped into the whip\u2019s race.\n\nBoth candidacies are a direct affront to Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American in Congress, who is in line to become the whip. He announced his bid Wednesday, pledging to \u201cmake America\u2019s greatness apply fairly and equitably to all Americans.\u201d\n\nThree others announced their runs for assistant leader, the new No. 4 post, including Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, the chairman of the campaign committee who helped lead his colleagues to the majority.\n\nSo far, though, no one has mounted a serious direct challenge to Pelosi, and some are reluctant to take on the first female speaker after an election that brought a record number of women to the polls and to the House.\n\n\u2033\u2018Thank you for returning us to the majority. Now we want to say goodbye\u2019? That\u2019s very difficult,\u201d said Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va. \u201cBut the math is very difficult for her, and it\u2019s inescapable.\u201d\n\nOhio Rep. Tim Ryan, who ran against Pelosi last year as a centrist alternative, said colleagues want to do what\u2019s best for the new members coming from districts that just flipped from Republicans. He said those Democrats need to be able to run for re-election in two years without being saddled with the GOP\u2019s attacks on Pelosi.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that keeps emerging in the conversation is, What do we have to do to protect our new members?\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWhat are we doing to protect the majority makers?\u201d\n\nFallout on the Republican side of the aisle is just as complicated, with Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California facing a challenge from conservative Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio for the top spot in their shrunken ranks. Both said they will seek the job of minority leader.\n\nRepublican leadership elections are set for next week.\n\nFor Pelosi, Trump\u2019s endorsement Wednesday could be just what she needs to push past the naysayers and help neutralize the critics. He said he would be happy to help \u201csupply her the necessary votes.\u201d\n\nPelosi appreciated the gesture but said she doesn\u2019t \u201cdeserve\u201d to be speaker based on what she\u2019s done. \u201cIt\u2019s what you can do.\u201d She often says her fashion choices make a political statement, and her pink dress on Wednesday spoke volumes.

California voters have passed up two chances to lower taxes by rejecting a proposed repeal of a gasoline tax hike and a proposed tax break for older homeowners. Political experts on Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018 said the election results could highlight a greater tolerance for taxes in the nation's most populous state, even as many of its residents bemoan the high cost of living. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Californians passed up two chances to lower taxes, voting to keep higher gasoline taxes and reject a proposed tax break for older homeowners in moves that experts said could highlight a greater tolerance for taxes even as many state residents bemoan the high cost of living.\n\nVoters on Tuesday rejected Proposition 6, a Republican-backed proposal to repeal increases in fuel taxes and vehicle fees that are funding $52 billion in road fixes and transit upgrades over a decade.\n\nA separate measure, Proposition 5, to expand a property tax break for older homeowners who move also failed at the polls.\n\n\u201cWe are more willing to tax ourselves than 30 or 40 years ago,\u201d said Wesley Hussey, political science professor at California State University, Sacramento. \u201cThe state has become more Democratic, but it is still a very cautious state when it comes to taxation.\u201d\n\nIn a major pushback against taxation four decades ago, California passed Proposition 13, dramatically limiting property tax increases. Since then, the state\u2019s demographics and politics have changed, and some experts said that may have made taxes more palatable to voters.\n\nDemocrats now hold nearly all statewide offices and are aiming for a two-thirds majority in the state Legislature. About 44 percent of registered voters are Democrats and only one in four are registered Republicans. Both parties have seen their share of registered voters decline since 1978 amid a surge in independents.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, persuaded voters to support raising income taxes on the wealthy six years ago to cope with a state budget crisis. Brown was re-elected two years later, and voters approved a ballot measure extending the increases two years after that.\n\n\u201cOf course it was controversial, and people still argued maybe it was the wrong thing to do, but if we look at the politics of it, I think it was widely seen to solve a problem,\u201d said Joseph Bankman, a professor at Stanford Law School who researches tax law.\n\nWith nearly 8 million ballots counted Wednesday, Proposition 5 was behind with 42 percent of the vote. Proposition 6 garnered about 45 percent of votes counted.\n\nJeffrey Cummins, a political science professor at California State University, Fresno, said while the two measures faced different challenges, both tapped a growing willingness among Californians to consider higher taxes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear over the last several elections that California voters are much more open to considering tax increases and they don\u2019t have a knee-jerk reaction to tax increases, like maybe they did in the 2000s,\u201d Cummins said.\n\nThe gas tax repeal encountered opposition that was well-financed and included conservative stalwarts, like the California Chamber of Commerce, Cummins said. The ballot\u2019s title \u2014 \u201cEliminates Certain Road Repair and Transportation Funding\u201d \u2014 likely turned off Californians who widely recognize the state\u2019s roads are in poor shape.\n\nThe measure to expand property tax breaks for older homeowners who move may have suffered from confusion about what it would do, which typically causes people to vote no, Cummins said. Its main sponsor, the California Association of Realtors, also didn\u2019t do any television or radio advertising or direct mailers, despite having a significant fundraising advantage.\n\nCarl DeMaio, a San Diego talk radio host and former councilman who led the push to lower fuel taxes, said he believes that measure failed because the ballot title crafted by the Democratic state attorney general didn\u2019t immediately tell voters it was a tax repeal. He said he\u2019ll continue to pursue tax reforms via ballot.\n\nThe association said it would be back with a revised measure in 2020 and try to work with the state Legislature to achieve its goals, a strategy that has previously failed.\n\nBruce Cain, a political science professor at Stanford University, said he doesn\u2019t believe Californians have a big appetite for taxes though perhaps more so than during the 1970s \u2014 and that may be because Democrats haven\u2019t been as quick to ramp up spending as before Proposition 13.\n\nHe noted that Proposition 5 supporters had to contend with growing resentment among young people facing rising home prices, and Proposition 6 was marketed to Republicans to spur GOP turnout in contested congressional and state races.\n\nVoters have also been willing to pay for some services more than others.\n\nScott Soykin, a Sacramento voter who considers himself independent, said he voted against the gas tax repeal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more than willing to pay more for gasoline if it means that we\u2019re going to drive on safer roads,\u201d he said.\n\nThe degree to which Californians are willing to tax themselves could face another test in two years. Property tax growth was limited after Proposition 13 passed in 1978, and as a result, a home in California is typically taxed at 1.1 percent of the purchase price and increases no more than 2 percent a year.\n\nA proposal to change that by scaling back Proposition 13 protections for commercial and industrial properties is eligible for the 2020 ballot.\n\n___\n\nSpagat reported from San Diego.

Gov.-elect Peggy Flanagan, as they took the stage for their acceptance speech at the DFL headquarters election party at the Intercontinental Hotel in downtown St. Paul, Minn., Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018. (Anthony Souffle/Star Tribune via AP)\n\nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) \u2014 It was a tale of two political parties in Minnesota on Wednesday: resurgent Democrats who tightened their grip on the governor\u2019s office and two U.S. Senate seats in Tuesday\u2019s election, and wincing Republicans shut out of statewide contests for a 12th straight year and swept out of power in the Minnesota House.\n\nDemocrats cruised to easy victories up and down the ballot, as Tim Walz won an open governor\u2019s race by more than 11 percentage points over Republican Jeff Johnson. U.S. Sen Tina Smith won voters\u2019 approval to finish former Sen. Al Franken\u2019s term by a similar margin. After fears that he would lose a race for attorney general marred by allegations that he once physically abused an ex-girlfriend and his opponent\u2019s controversial legal career, Keith Ellison won the race by nearly 4 percentage points.\n\nBehind each election lies a troubling and familiar trend for Republicans: They keep losing ground in Minnesota\u2019s metropolitan core and surrounding suburbs.\n\nFormer Gov. Tim Pawlenty stitched together the party\u2019s last statewide victory in 2006 by holding pace in the state\u2019s population centers, with 47 percent of the vote in Minnesota\u2019s seven-county metropolitan area, while winning over rural voters. But the GOP\u2019s share of the urban and suburban vote has steadily slipped.\n\nJohnson lost to outgoing Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton in 2014 thanks largely to a 133,000-vote edge in the metro. On Tuesday night, Walz beat Johnson in the same seven counties of Hennepin, Ramsey, Anoka, Washington, Dakota, Carver and Scott by 372,000 votes.\n\n\u201cThe suburbs were a massacre,\u201d former Republican House Minority Leader Marty Seifert said. \u201cThe pathway to victory is going to have to be cobbling together a coalition ... that runs through the suburbs into rural Minnesota. You can\u2019t have one or the other \u2014 you\u2019ve got to have both.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do some soul searching,\u201d he added.\n\nThe state\u2019s record-breaking turnout \u2014 nearly 2.6 million voters cast ballots in Minnesota in the midterm election, according to the secretary of state\u2019s office \u2014 was centered in that region. And there were other factors at play that helped Democrats keep Republicans off the board for a fifth consecutive election.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, a popular Democrat who easily clinched a third term against a little-known opponent with 60 percent of the vote, helped other Democrats on the ballot. Both parties concede a backlash against President Donald Trump and his party was a factor \u2014 Minnesota is no stranger to midterm swings.\n\nBut even in strong years for Republicans nationwide like midterm elections during former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, statewide GOP candidates have been unable to break through in Minnesota. And the effects of Democrats\u2019 strong night at the top of the ticket spilled down ballot.\n\nDemocratic House Minority Leader Melissa Hortman credited a combination of strong candidates and top-of-ticket help \u2014 including from two Democratic candidates who easily unseated incumbent Republican Reps. Erik Paulsen and Jason Lewis in the suburbs \u2014 with Democrats\u2019 takeover of the House.\n\nDemocrats won 17 GOP-held districts to retake the majority \u2014 all but one in the Minneapolis-area suburbs. An 18th potential flip of a Bemidji House seat will be subject to a state-funded recount \u2014 former Democratic Rep. John Persell won back his district by just eight votes, according to unofficial results.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party leadership of right now is out of touch with urban and suburban voters. I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re getting these voters back unless they change what their party is about,\u201d said Hortman, adding that Democratic suburban candidates put new gun restrictions, abortion access and public school funding at the heart of their campaigns.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all bad news for Republicans. The party clung to its one-seat majority in the state Senate with a special election win in a heavily conservative central Minnesota district. Former Sen. Michelle Fischbach\u2019s departure in May to be sworn in as lieutenant governor triggered an all-out brawl for the Senate majority, but GOP Rep. Jeff Howe easily won that seat.\n\nAnd at the federal level, Republicans flipped two open congressional districts now held by Democrats. Local county commissioner Pete Stauber handily won northeastern Minnesota\u2019s 8th Congressional District. Republican Jim Hagedorn broke through on his fourth try in Minnesota\u2019s 1st Congressional District, defeating Democrat Dan Feehan by a razor-thin margin.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "1 of 3 Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Allen Hurns (17) runs into the end zone against Tennessee Titans cornerback Malcolm Butler (21) for a touchdown during the first half of an NFL football game, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, in Arlington, Texas. (AP Photo/Ron Jenkins)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Titans cornerback Malcolm Butler knows why he has struggled so much that opposing quarterbacks keep picking on him.\n\n\u201cJust got to be more detailed and more disciplined on those little things,\u201d Butler said Wednesday. \u201cI threw that last eight weeks behind me, and I got a whole \u2019nother eight weeks to try to make up for it.\u201d\n\nButler has to do something.\n\nThe Titans have allowed the fewest touchdowns in the NFL with 14. Yet, Butler has been the weak link: He has allowed the most touchdown passes (seven) and most yards receiving (618) of any cornerback in the league, according to Pro Football Focus. The Dallas Cowboys scored both of their TDs at Butler\u2019s expense Monday night in Tennessee\u2019s 28-14 victory.\n\nButler is the cornerback that New England benched during the Super Bowl last February when the Patriots lost to Philadelphia. He then signed a five-year deal worth more than $60 million with $30 million guaranteed with the Titans in March.\n\nHe started the first five games this season. Over the past three, the Titans have started Adoree Jackson alongside Logan Ryan with Butler as the third cornerback.\n\nWith Butler on the field, Dak Prescott hit Amari Cooper for a 4-yard touchdown pass with his receiver creating space from Butler by running right before cutting back toward the left pylon. Butler appeared to look back at Prescott and left Allen Hurns wide open for a 23-yard TD pass.\n\nButler plays aggressively, which he said is hard to balance at times.\n\n\u201cJust got to work my way around it and just make plays and play football and do what I\u2019ve been doing my whole career,\u201d Butler said. \u201cJust got to hold up.\u201d\n\nHis next challenge comes Sunday against his former team when Tom Brady and the Patriots (7-2) visit the Titans (4-4). The Titans have been coaching Butler on his issues, and coach Mike Vrabel said Butler needs to have his eyes on the receiver in man coverage and not Brady.\n\n\u201cMalcolm knows that, and we\u2019ve talked about that, and we continue to practice it, we continue to coach it and we try to show it to him,\u201d Vrabel said. \u201cWhen he does that, it\u2019s pretty good, it\u2019s competitive. He challenges the receivers. When you look back at the quarterback, your man has a tendency to go in another direction.\u201d\n\nPatriots coach Bill Belichick still has not said why he benched Butler and wouldn\u2019t discuss the cornerback specifically on Wednesday when asked what Butler is doing differently. Instead, the coach talked about the Titans\u2019 defense, which leads the NFL in fewest points allowed per game.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our challenge as an offense is we\u2019re playing 11 guys, we\u2019re playing their coaching staff and the schemes they put up against us,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cAnd, right now, they\u2019re playing better defense than anybody in the league. So, we\u2019ll see how we do.\u201d\n\nPatriots receiver Julian Edelman said Butler is a cornerback who\u2019s strong at playing the ball in the air. Edelman also has a lot of respect for a man he called a \u201cheart player,\u201d whose progress from being undrafted out of West Alabama to now is proof of the cornerback\u2019s hard work.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gotten beat a couple of times, but that goes with the nature of his game,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cHe\u2019s a real aggressive player that competes, plays the ball well through your hands. He\u2019s long, (strong) upper body. He\u2019s got that ability to make up speed with the ball in the air while looking back. A lot of corners can\u2019t do that. I got a lot of respect for Malcolm.\u201d\n\nNotes: The Titans held a walk-through practice Wednesday.

The Patriots traded for Van Noy out of necessity two years ago. He\u2019s grown into one of the most versatile players on New England\u2019s defense. Used almost exclusively at outside linebacker last season, he\u2019s now asked to play on the line at times, is an option in multiple blitz packages as well as in zone and man coverages.\n\nMiami: Offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil. Tunsil is becoming a top-shelf left tackle in his third season. He was plagued by penalties and other lapses, but has benefited from the mentoring of left guard Josh Sitton, who signed with the Dolphins this year.\n\nBuffalo: Linebacker Matt Milano. Milano is starting alongside first-round pick Tremaine Edmunds in essentially a two-linebacker defensive formation. A fifth-round pick in 2017, Milano was eased into the starting lineup and finished with five starts. This year, he\u2019s has started all nine games, credited with 55 tackles.\n\nN.Y. Jets: Linebacker Darron Lee. Lee was their first-round pick out of Ohio State in 2016 and has been slow to live up to his lofty draft status. He finished second on the team in tackles each of his first two seasons, but big-time impact plays were missing for a middle linebacker. He\u2019s off to the best start of his career as a more consistent playmaker.\n\nAFC SOUTH\n\nHouston: Defensive back Kareem Jackson. Jackson had a bad 2017 at cornerback, but has played both cornerback and safety this season and has been strong in a secondary that has dealt with numerous injuries.\n\nTennessee: Linebacker Jayon Brown. A fifth-round pick out of UCLA in 2017, the second-year linebacker is leading the Titans both in total tackles and with four sacks. The speedy Brown has started three of eight games this season and has been a key piece of a defense currently allowing the fewest points in the NFL.\n\nJacksonville: Kicker Josh Lambo. Lambo has made a team-record 23 consecutive field goals in the regular season, including a career-best 57-yarder in London. He had made 27 in a row, including the playoffs, and all 12 of his extra points in 2018.\n\nIndianapolis: Quarterback Andrew Luck. Luck didn\u2019t just miss all 16 games last season but 26 of 45 overall because of various injuries (shoulder, lacerated kidney, concussion and then shoulder again). Luck has completed 65.8 percent of his passes, is second in TD passes (23) and is on pace to top 4,000 yards again.\n\nAFC NORTH\n\nPittsburgh: Running back James Conner. Conner has seamlessly replaced Le\u2019Veon Bell with four games with at least 100 rushing yards, 50 receiving yards and at least one touchdown, the most such games by a player in a single season in NFL history. Conner has 1,085 scrimmage yards (706 rushing, 379 receiving) and 10 total touchdowns (nine rushing, one receiving).\n\nCincinnati: Wide receiver Tyler Boyd. Boyd has been a solid complement to star A.J. Green. He has 49 catches for 620 yards and five TDs and will be counted on in the second half with Green dealing with a toe injury.\n\nBaltimore: Quarterback Joe Flacco. Despite his team\u2019s recent slump, Flacco has done well for the Ravens. He\u2019s got 12 TDs, six interceptions, 2,465 yards passing and an 84.15 QB rating. Last year, Flacco finished at 18 TDs, 13 INTs and 80.4. He had 3,141 yards.\n\nCleveland: Defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi. Ogunjobi, a third-round pick in 2017, made one start as a rookie. The 6-foot-3, 305-pounder has developed into a stout run stopper. He also has quickness to get to the quarterback. His presence inside has forced teams to adjust their blocking schemes and given Myles Garrett some favorable one-on-one matchups.\n\nAFC WEST\n\nKansas City: Quarterback Pat Mahomes. Mahomes started Week 17 last year, but in his first full season as No. 1 QB he\u2019s breaking records all over the place. Mahomes, who appeared in his 10th career game last Sunday against Cleveland, has 29 touchdown passes and 3,185 passing yards, both the most by a player in his first 10 games.\n\nL.A. Chargers: Running back Austin Ekeler. The second-year player, an undrafted free agent, is averaging 5.8 yards per carry and 12 yards a reception. Ekeler has teamed with Melvin Gordon to form one of the league\u2019s top running back duos.\n\nDenver: Wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders. He was hurt most of 2017 and caught two TD passes, both in Week 2 vs Cowboys. Last year, he had 47 catches for 555 yards in 12 games. This year, he has 56 catches for 707 yards and three TDs and even threw for a TD, hitting fellow SMU alum Courtland Sutton vs. Arizona.\n\nOakland: Running back Jalen Richard. Richard showed flashes his first two seasons as an undrafted free agent out of Southern Mississippi, but has emerged as a key part of coach Jon Gruden\u2019s offense.\n\nNFC EAST\n\nWashington: Safety D.J. Swearinger. Swearinger is tied for the NFL lead with four interceptions as a key part of a secondary that has Washington in first place.\n\nPhiladelphia: Running back Wendell Smallwood. Smallwood has a career-best 400 scrimmage yards (257 rushing, 143 receiving) along with one rushing TD and two receiving TDs after only playing eight games last year when he was inactive often.\n\nDallas: Linebacker Jaylon Smith. The former Notre Dame standout is finally showing his college form almost three years removed from a devastating left knee injury in his final game for the Irish.\n\nN.Y. Giants: Wide receiver Sterling Shepard. Shepard has 40 catches for 542 yards and two touchdowns. Despite a porous offensive line, he is on pace for career highs.\n\nNFC SOUTH\n\nNew Orleans: Defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins. Rankins was a 2016 first-rounder who missed the first half of his rookie season with a leg injury. Last season, he was solid, but highlights were few. Through the first eight games, Rankins has four sacks and 21 total tackles, on pace for considerable increases in those categories.\n\nCarolina: Defensive tackle Kyle Love. Love is a backup, but is making some outstanding plays in the middle of the line, including a forced fumble in Week 8 against Ravens RB Alex Collins that led to a TD and helped turn the game.\n\nAtlanta: Free safety Damontae Kazee. Kazee is tied for the NFL lead with four interceptions. He was forced into a starting role after Keanu Neal and Ricardo Allen were placed on IR.\n\nTampa Bay: Tight end O.J. Howard. The Bucs attribute Howard\u2019s growth to being in his second year, being more comfortable with the playbook and the offense in general. He has caught three touchdown passes in the past two games.\n\nNFC NORTH\n\nChicago: Quarterback Mitchell Trubisky. Trubisky has a 96.1 passer rating, 64.6 percent completion rate, 16 touchdown passes, seven interceptions and a 5-3 record. Last year, he had a 77.5 rating, 59.4 percent completion rate, seven TD passes, seven interceptions and a 4-8 record.\n\nMinnesota: Defensive end Stephen Weatherly. Weatherly was a seventh-round draft pick in 2016 who spent most of the season on the practice squad and mostly was on special teams in 2017. But when Everson Griffen was sidelined, Weatherly moved into the starting lineup and had seven tackles, two quarterback hits and one sack in his first career start against the Bills.\n\nGreen Bay: Defensive lineman Kenny Clark.

They have fought Trump\u2019s efforts to roll back environmental protections and expanded protections for immigrants living in the state illegally.\n\nTheir positions broadly reflect the views of most Californians, according to results from AP VoteCast, a survey of the American electorate.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Californians are opposed to building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and 8 in 10 say immigrants living in the country illegally should be offered a chance at legal status. Three in 4 said it\u2019s the government\u2019s responsibility to provide health care, while more than 8 in 10 say climate change is a major concern. About half of Californians said they voted to express opposition to Trump.\n\n\u201cIf you can combine the Democrats and the independents in California you have a recipe for some very left-of-center policy making which will contrast what we see going on in the rest of the nation,\u201d said Kim Nalder, director of the Project for an Informed Electorate at the California State University-Sacramento. \u201cIf we continue to see numbers like this in California, Gavin Newsom will absolutely be emboldened to pursue more liberal policies than we\u2019ve seen under the current governor.\u201d\n\nAP VoteCast is an innovative nationwide survey of about 139,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 3,769 voters and 617 nonvoters in California \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nNewsom has already outlined the stakes of California\u2019s battles with Trump under his leadership, telling supporters Tuesday it\u2019s \u201cCalifornia\u2019s moment.\u201d\n\nHe supports a government-run universal health care system, opposes Trump\u2019s border wall and backs a host of liberal policies on climate change, gun control and protections for immigrants who entered the country illegally.\n\nCalifornia has moved consistently left over the years, particularly since Trump\u2019s election. Democrats held almost every statewide office in Tuesday\u2019s contest.\n\nJust one race, the contest for insurance commissioner between Democrat Ricardo Lara and Steve Poizner, a former Republican running as an independent, had not been called by AP on Wednesday. The GOP has fallen to third party status behind voters who choose no party affiliation.\n\nNewsom is replacing Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat who held the seat a record four terms - first in the 1970s and 1980s - and again since 2010. Brown has battled fiercely with the Trump administration on climate change policies but resisted big-ticket spending.\n\nWhile the electorate supports progressive policies in broad brushes, Newsom could see less support on specific proposals if they are expensive, said Mark Baldassare, president of the Public Policy Institute of California.\n\n\u201cWhere the support starts to erode is when you\u2019re asking to raise new taxes or you\u2019re doing things that the public might view as more financially risky than Gov. Brown did,\u201d he said.\n\nThe state\u2019s elected Democrats widely support expanding access to health care, but there are deep disagreements over policy details. Newsom supported a bill to create a government-run health care system that would eliminate insurance companies and cost an estimated $400 billion. It died in the Assembly last year.\n\nBrown has aggressively pursued policies to curb carbon emissions and slow the effects of climate change, and the survey showed California voters broadly agree climate change is a major concern.\n\nCalifornia is suing to protect stricter standards for vehicle emissions that the Trump administration is trying to repeal and the state is reducing its reliance on fossil fuels for electricity.\n\nThe survey in many ways aligns California with global attitudes on issues such as health care and climate change, Nalder said.", "FILE - In this Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, file photo, Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy (25) is tackled during the second half of an NFL football game against the Chicago Bears in Orchard Park, N.Y.

I\u2019m trying to get myself together.\u201d\n\nAnd off he went. McCoy returned to the locker room briefly about 45 minutes later, before exiting yet again upon seeing a large group of reporters gathered at his stall.\n\nWhatever frustrations McCoy has while enduring the worst start to a season in his 10-year career, or concerns he might have about an offense not producing at an alarmingly anemic rate, he\u2019d prefer to keep to himself as Buffalo (2-7) prepares to play at the New York Jets (3-6) on Sunday.\n\nMcCoy hasn\u2019t formally addressed the media since acknowledging he\u2019s never been through as bad of a stretch as this in his life, following a 25-6 loss to New England on Oct. 29. After gaining 12 yards on his first carry against the Patriots, McCoy combined for just 1 more yard on his final 11 attempts of the game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had bad games, but this, the flow of the season and everything, is bad,\u201d he said.\n\nThings got worse Sunday, when McCoy managed 10 yards on 10 carries in a 41-9 loss to Chicago.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s\u2019 too talented for that,\u201d fullback Patrick DiMarco said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that can change a game and take over a game. He knows that. We know that. Upstairs they know that. We\u2019ve got to get him going.\u201d\n\nOne issue is he\u2019s part of a patchwork offense that\u2019s scored just 96 points, topped 300 yards net offense twice and has no continuity at quarterback . McCoy\u2019s also had off-field distractions amid allegations of abusing his son \u2014 which he\u2019s denied \u2014 stemming from a lawsuit filed by his ex-girlfriend.\n\nAnd age could be catching up to McCoy, who turned 30 in July.\n\nCoach Sean McDermott doesn\u2019t buy it and blames McCoy\u2019s struggles on the entire offense.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been some opportunities to hit some holes that weren\u2019t hit, and there\u2019s been some opportunities where the seam was there, and we didn\u2019t get the movement we needed,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cIt\u2019s been really a combination, but we\u2019ve got to give him more opportunities to make more big plays for us.\u201d\n\nA year after topping 1,100 yards rushing for the sixth time, the NFL\u2019s 2013 rushing leader is barely on pace to break 500.\n\nHe\u2019s managed 267 yards rushing and has yet to score in essentially seven games this season. McCoy missed one game due to a rib injury, and was limited to playing two snaps before sustaining a concussion in a 37-5 loss at Indianapolis three weeks ago.\n\nMcCoy hasn\u2019t scored since having a touchdown rushing and receiving in a 24-17 win over Miami on Dec. 17. And he hasn\u2019t topped 100 yards since finishing with 156 on a snow-covered field in a 13-7 overtime win against Indianapolis on Dec. 10.\n\nThe recent swoon in production spans the NFL trading deadline on Oct. 30, and amid speculation McCoy might have been dealt because he has one year left on his contract, or that he was open to leaving a rebuilding team in order to play for a contender.\n\nGeneral manager Brandon Beane dismissed the narratives by saying McCoy\u2019s silence stems from mere frustration.\n\n\u201cI can tell you, LeSean is very happy here. He\u2019s frustrated just like I am, just like a lot of guys on our offense,\u201d Beane told The Associated Press. \u201cHe\u2019s a winner. He\u2019s a competitor. And he\u2019s not happy with our whole offense.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)\n\nCOSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Chargers have proven during the first half of the season that they have plenty of weapons on offense. One who has emerged is Tyrell Williams, who has become a deep threat during the past month.\n\nGoing into Sunday\u2019s game at Oakland, the fourth-year wide receiver has four touchdowns and is averaging 28.8 yards per catch over the past three games.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s become a complete receiver. His receiving skills, he\u2019s just taken them to another level,\u201d Chargers coach Anthony Lynn said.\n\nWith Keenan Allen still drawing double teams, Williams continues to benefit from single coverage. Five of his receptions during the past three games have gone for 20 yards or more, including a 75-yarder against Tennessee on Oct. 21. He is tied for the team lead in receiving touchdowns (five), second in yardage (451) and third in receptions (22) during the first half of the season.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really just been seeing what the defense does, when to take shots, being able to get over the top and trusting my ability to go up and get the ball or run past the defense,\u201d said Williams, whose 20.5 yards per reception average is third in the league.\n\nPhilip Rivers also hasn\u2019t been afraid to go to Williams on consecutive plays if the matchup is favorable. Williams caught both passes on a two-play, 89-yard drive midway through the second quarter of the Oct. 14 game at Cleveland, including a 45-yard touchdown where he got leverage over cornerback Damarious Randall.\n\nWhile Williams has made his biggest impact on downfield plays, he has also shown his improvement in other areas. Late in the first quarter of last Sunday\u2019s game at Seattle, Williams made a diving grab on a back shoulder fade for a 14-yard touchdown while being covered by Tre Flowers.\n\nWilliams said catching back shoulder passes and route running were two things that he placed added emphasis on improving this past offseason.\n\n\u201cMy first few years, I was always just looking to get the ball down the field. I wasn\u2019t really prepared for back-shoulders,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of a timing thing and getting used to that, but now I\u2019ve kind of figured out how to be running fast but still be prepared for that back-shoulder stuff.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles (6-2) has won five straight for the first time since 2014 and will face a Raiders defense that is 24th against the pass. Williams had three receptions for 66 yards in the first meeting on Oct. 14, which the Chargers won 26-10. One of the catches was for 48 yards.\n\n\u201cHopefully that stays the same and they don\u2019t switch it up.

(AP) \u2014 South Dakota\u2019s first-in-the-nation law that bans out-of-state money from ballot question campaigns faces an uncertain future, with critics saying it\u2019s likely to be challenged in court.\n\nThe ballot question easily passed Tuesday in an election that also saw South Dakota voters approve an initiative to require constitutional amendments to stick to a single subject. House Speaker Mark Mickelson, who spearheaded both, has won changes to the state\u2019s ballot question system since out-of-state donors put more than $10 million into campaigns for or against South Dakota questions during the 2016 election cycle.\n\n\u201cI think these guys are going to take their chips and go play in Idaho or North Dakota and leave us alone,\u201d Mickelson said. As for a lawsuit against the out-of-state ban, he said: \u201cBring it on. We\u2019ll win. And it\u2019s a fight worth having.\u201d\n\nBut Don Haggar, state director of Americans for Prosperity-South Dakota, said he expects it to be overturned.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s clearly unconstitutional on several levels and we are examining our options as far as potential litigation is concerned,\u201d Haggar said.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution\u2019s free-speech protections as prohibiting any limitations on money in ballot measure elections, Paul S. Ryan, vice president of policy and litigation at the nonprofit Common Cause, told The Associated Press earlier this year.\n\nThe high court has said that contributions to candidates can be limited to prevent the corruption of public officials. At least two states, Alaska and Hawaii, restrict out-of-state contributions to candidates, but Alaska\u2019s limits face a court challenge.\n\nJosh Altic, ballot measures project director at online political encyclopedia Ballotpedia, said in an email he\u2019s confident the South Dakota measure would be the first statewide prohibition on out-of-state contributions to ballot question campaigns. It\u2019s set to take effect in July.\n\nIt bars contributions to ballot question committees from nonresidents, out-of-state political committees and entities that haven\u2019t filed with the secretary of state\u2019s office for the preceding four years.\n\nDoug Kronaizl, who worked on an unsuccessful government ethics amendment this year, said he thinks it will make the ballot question system less transparent, contending the law has loopholes that groups will seek to exploit. Kronaizl said the single-subject rule will turn the initiative process more litigious.\n\n\u201cI definitely see that having a much more tangible effect, because ... they don\u2019t tell you what single subject means, so that just means it\u2019s up to a judge to decide at the end of the day,\u201d Kronaizl said.\n\nSouth Dakota was the first state to adopt citizen initiatives, in 1898. Mickelson said the single-subject measure strengthens the state\u2019s initiative system, providing clarity to residents about what they\u2019re voting on.\n\n\u201cIf people want to amend the constitution, it\u2019s one idea at a time, and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Mickelson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not blocking any particular idea or kind of idea, it just says you don\u2019t package a bunch of them together and hide the bad ones.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 The migrants in a caravan used by President Donald Trump as a campaign issue were almost universally unaware of the results of the U.S. midterm elections.\n\nThe Central Americans were more concerned with the dangers of northern Mexico as they struggled to reach the U.S. border, still hundreds of miles away, than with who controls the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nKenia Johana Hernandez, a 26-year Honduran farmworker, left her country with her 2-year-old daughter because she couldn\u2019t afford child care or schooling. Asked if her decision to emigrate had anything to do with the U.S. elections, the answer was a simple, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nFor her, the caravan was merely a safety measure. \u201cIf I had come alone with just my daughter, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have even made it this far because it is so dangerous,\u201d she said.\n\nGilberta Raula, 38, from Samala, Guatemala, joined the caravan at the Mexican border because it seemed her best chance to get her 15-year-old daughter out of the country. She left six other children behind, but wants to give her daughter an opportunity to study and work.\n\nShe had only the vaguest idea of the issues surrounding Tuesday\u2019s U.S. midterms.\n\nWhat she did know, she said, was that \u201cthe U.S. president has acted badly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way we hear it, he doesn\u2019t like anybody,\u201d she said of Trump. Told that Trump\u2019s Republican party had lost control of the U.S. House of Representatives she said, \u201cAh, good.\u201d She, like others, expressed hope that somehow it might help their chances of finding refuge.\n\nFranklin Martinez, a 46-year-old farmworker from La Esperanza, Honduras, said Wednesday he\u2019d probably stay in Mexico City for a while before setting off again northward, to see if things changed following the U.S. elections.\n\n\u201cBecause now it\u2019s an anti-immigrant wave,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThey\u2019re not well-received at the border.\u201d\n\nExperts agree that the formation of this latest caravan and the others that have set off for the U.S. border before it have far more to do with politics in Central America and current conditions in Mexico, where drug gangs frequently kidnap migrants to demand ransom from their families in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe first concern is collective security, there is safety in numbers,\u201d said Mexican security analyst Alejandro Hope. \u201cThere is a political logic to this, but it\u2019s not exactly aimed at influencing the U.S. elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt brings pressure on the authorities of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador more than anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cThis sends a message that there is a human rights crisis in the Northern Triangle of Central America.\u201d\n\nThat view was shared by former Honduran lawmaker Bartolo Fuentes, who helped formed the caravan of just a few hundred migrants that set out from Honduras on Oct. 13, before growing to as many as 7,000 at its peak. Fuentes told a news conference at the Mexico City stadium where the migrants are staying that the caravan embarrasses the Honduran government \u201cbecause now the world is seeing the tragedy we live with.\u201d\n\nRaul Benitez, a security expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said the Republican losses in the House suggest that Trump tried to use the migrants \u201cpolitically, to depict the caravan as an invasion, and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nBenitez said the caravan has put as much pressure on Mexico as the United States. After the migrants entered, Mexico came under pressure to accelerate the refugee and asylum process for Central Americans.\n\n\u201cThe caravan shows that Mexico could give more humanitarian treatment to these people,\u201d said Benitez, \u201cthat Mexico should treat these people the way Mexico wants the U.S. to treat migrants.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Christopher Gascon, the Mexico representative for the International Organization for Migration, estimated there were about 6,000 migrants at the sports complex and maybe another 4,000 in caravans that are working their way through southern Mexico.\n\nBut some migrants had been visiting the organization\u2019s tent asking about how they can return home.\n\n\u201cThey perhaps didn\u2019t have a very clear idea of what they faced,\u201d Gascon said. He said the first bus leaving Mexico City to take migrants back to their countries was scheduled to depart Wednesday night with 40 to 50 people.\n\nMeanwhile, other migrants were focusing on the daunting task of reaching the U.S. border and presenting asylum requests there. The U.S. elections occupied only a small part of their thoughts.\n\nNora Torres, a 53-year-old Honduran, anxiously asked a reporter: \u201cHow did he (Trump) do?

He wants to restructure tribal government to avoid layoffs of tribal employees after the coal-fired Navajo Generating Station and the Kayenta Mine close at the end of 2019.\n\nBoth are major employers on the huge reservation in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, and officials have estimated that the tribal government could lose 30 percent of its revenue after they shutter.\n\nNez said he would work with tribal employees in his attempt to escape layoffs.\n\n\u201cIf we can all commit to making these changes and reorganize some of these programs, I truly believe we won\u2019t have to have any layoffs,\u201d Nez said.\n\nHundreds of Navajos who work at the mine will lose their jobs, while power plant workers are being offered other jobs with the Arizona utility that operates the generating station.\n\nNez said he\u2019ll leave economic development to his vice president, Myron Lizer, who manages hardware stores on the reservation.\n\nOutgoing tribal President Russell Begaye, who defeated Shirley in the last election, did not advance beyond the primary.\n\nShirley said he told his supporters they ran a good campaign focused on business development, tourism and empowering small Navajo communities to impose local taxes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to go around with my head hung low,\u201d Shirley said.\n\nAbout 98,000 Navajos were registered to vote in Tuesday\u2019s election but some could not because polling places unexpectedly experienced ballot shortages.\n\nSteve Blackrock left a polling place near Pinon after waiting for an hour to see if more ballots would arrive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad feeling knowing that you weren\u2019t able to participate in such an important day,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lack of ballots was traced to a measure that asked Navajos if they wanted to grant raises for the tribal president and vice president, said Jared Touchin, a spokesman for the tribe\u2019s legislative branch.\n\nPeople who voted no were supposed to leave a second section blank that had different options for the raise amounts, Touchin said.

It is a sign of health for American democracy.\n\nDistrustful of untrammeled majorities, the authors of the Constitution favored checks and balances, including, crucially, the check that the legislative branch might place upon the executive. Over the past two years, the Republican majorities in the House and Senate have failed to exercise reasonable oversight. Now the constitutional system has a fresh chance to work as intended.\n\nThe Democratic victory is also a sign of political health, to the extent it is a form of pushback against the excesses, rhetorical and in terms of policy, committed by the Trump administration and propounded by President Trump during this fall\u2019s campaign. Turning against the dominant party in Washington even in a moment of economic prosperity, voters from Key West to Kansas refused to accept the continued degradation of their nation\u2019s political culture. Republicans retained control of the Senate, where the map this year favored their defense. But voters nationwide refused Mr. Trump\u2019s invitation to vote on the basis of fear of immigrants; they did not respond to his depiction of his opposition as dangerous enemies.\n\nNow the House will be in a position to investigate any number of potential administration transgressions and demand accountability: the awful separation of migrant children from their parents; the dubious decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 Census; the president\u2019s harassment of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation.\n\nThe new majority also has an opportunity to offer a positive legislative agenda. The Democrats achieved their victory Tuesday night in large part by promising to protect health-care coverage, especially for Americans with preexisting conditions. Though effective in winning over moderate voters, the campaign did not establish a clear mandate for much beyond that \u2014 eminently valid \u2014 objective. And of course, even if the Democrats set forth a list of specific proposals for the House, before or after Election Day, the Senate and Mr. Trump\u2019s veto pen could block it.\n\nStill, the party can outline an alternative policy direction for the country. It can begin with measures to shore up the Affordable Care Act but then move to reforms of federal gun laws. Where the Republican majority has denied science, the Democrats can offer an approach to climate change. They can propose relief to the \u201cdreamers\u201d and, ideally, other undocumented immigrants, along with generous but not unlimited opportunities for future legal immigration. They should propose to restore the United States to its rightful place as a welcomer of refugees; to end the disgraceful denial of congressional representation to citizens in the District of Columbia; to repeal the most egregious giveaways to the rich in the 2017 tax bill.\n\nTuesday was a good day for Democrats. It may also be a good day for Republicans, if they take the lessons of their House defeat to heart and reconsider the devil\u2019s bargain they have made with Mr. Trump. Indeed, if the results help lead to a reemergence of that party\u2019s better angels, then it will have been good day for America as a whole.\n\nOnline: https://www.washingtonpost.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 5\n\nThe Telegraph on reinstated sanctions on Iran:\n\n...Although the EU, including Britain, is sticking to the nuclear deal unilaterally repudiated by President Trump, without America\u2019s backing it is pretty much a dead duck. Since European companies that continue trading with Iran risk being hit by secondary US sanctions, they are unlikely to keep doing so, despite promises of legal protection from Brussels.\n\nMr Trump made no secret of his intention to tear up the agreement while campaigning for the White House and a steady succession of EU leaders have made their way to Washington in an effort to change his mind, but to no avail. ...\n\nWhen the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the Iran deal was called, was agreed, there was always a need for caution. It was hailed as a triumph of enlightened diplomacy that made the world a safer place. Yet the Iranians, bolstered by greater oil revenues after sanctions were eased, have shown every sign of making the Middle East more dangerous, even if they have stuck to the specific agreement on nuclear arms development, which is questionable.\n\nThe collapse in the international common front on Iran is regrettable. But instead of trying to force a U-turn on Mr Trump, the other signatories need to consider ways in which to respond to his - and Israel\u2019s - objections to the deal.\n\nWhat is often overlooked by those whose dislike of Mr Trump is an all-consuming obsession is that many Iranians welcome his stand because they are desperate to see the end of the regime in Tehran. The deal was supposed to foster stability in the Middle East, help the people of Iran and encourage moderate forces in the country - but it has done none of this. The money released from the ending of sanctions has been poured into supporting militia groups fighting proxy wars, such as the Houthis in Yemen and Hizbollah in Syria.\n\nThe new sanctions target banks and the Iranian military, whose influence may persuade the ayatollahs running the country to return to the negotiating table. Everyone needs to realise that this is now the only way forward.\n\nOnline: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/\n\n___\n\nNov. 7\n\nDallas Morning News says Texas is not turning purple:\n\nThe question is on more than a few minds now. Did Beto O\u2019Rourke prove the once-unthinkable \u2014 that the near future of Texas is as a purple state?\n\nThose who hold out hope that, in fact, O\u2019Rourke showed it is possible to repaint this red state will point to several factors. The congressman went from little-known El Paso figure to a national sensation overnight and raised $70 million in the process. He forced Sen. Ted Cruz, a national figure on the right with a dedicated core of supporters, to run hard to win. And he appeared to be in a very competitive position in a series of polls over the course of the campaign.\n\nPolitical prognosticators might also point to other factors. Texas is a rapidly changing state attracting a wide swath of new voters. And just as rapid growth helped fuel a Republican takeover of Texas, such growth can change the political trajectory of a state. Colorado and Virginia are examples of states that are competitive today in part because, over time, the influx of residents can flip voting patterns. In Texas, this appears to take on added significance because of the growing number of Hispanic residents. It is presumed that in the coming years, they will break in favor of Democrats.\n\nAll of these things are true, but color us skeptical that they add up to a purple future for the state of Texas in the near term. Consider that Republicans who war with other Republicans tend to underperform. And Cruz spent the first few years of his term mixing up with members of his own party in Washington, then made a name for himself challenging his party on its principles as he ran for president. And, although anecdotal, we have met a lot of staunch Republicans who didn\u2019t vote for Cruz because they just don\u2019t like him.\n\nAll of that adds up to the fact that Cruz had work to do to win a second term. But there is more evidence to suggest this year\u2019s results are peculiar to the circumstances. We\u2019ll start with President Donald Trump\u2019s leadership style. To the extent that this election cycle was a referendum on the president, the results broke against Republicans generally. That is especially true in our suburbs. One reason Pete Sessions won\u2019t be returning to Congress is that he was a Republican running in the suburbs this year.\n\nDespite all of this, however, Democrats still failed to win a statewide race. They weren\u2019t able to defeat Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who became synonymous with divisive politics. The party of Beto also failed to unseat Ken Paxton, the state\u2019s attorney general who is under indictment. In the end, O\u2019Rourke outperformed Lupe Valdez, who ran a lackluster campaign for governor, by just five points in a year that was supposed to be a wave election against the president\u2019s party.\n\nTo us, what all of this shows is that there is a hunger among voters for candidates who offer a mix of optimism and who work against those who would divide us. Republicans are just as capable of offering that message. Indeed, it is the message that enabled George W. Bush to turn the state red in 1994. It\u2019s the message Ronald Reagan used to endear himself to a generation on the right. And, we suspect, it is a message candidates will rediscover as they consider what it will take to remain competitive in the years ahead.\n\nOnline: https://www.dallasnews.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 6\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on privately funded litigators working in state attorneys general offices:\n\nWith the courts and Trump Administration rolling back federal climate regulation, green activists have turned to the states. But there\u2019s a troubling ethical twist: Instead of merely lobbying, activists are placing employees in Attorneys General offices in dubious private-public condominiums.\n\nConsider a remarkable arrangement brokered by the NYU Law School\u2019s State Energy and Environmental Impact Center to fund legal services for state AGs. The group was launched in August 2017 to advance a liberal climate and energy agenda, courtesy of a $6 million grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies, which also financed the Sierra Club\u2019s Beyond Coal campaign.\n\nIn August 2017 the NYU outfit emailed then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman\u2019s office, offering to cover the salary and benefits of \u201cspecial assistant attorneys general,\u201d pending an application from the office that demonstrated how the new attorneys would be used. These privately funded staffers would work out of an AG\u2019s office for two years and deliver quarterly progress reports to the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center.\n\nThose progress reports would explain \u201cthe contribution that the legal fellow has made to the clean energy, climate change, and environmental initiatives\u201d within the attorney general\u2019s office, according to a December 2017 draft of an agreement between the Center and the New York AG obtained by Chris Horner of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n\nAttorneys General do sometimes bring on legal fellows or outside help to handle unique cases. But subject-matter experts aren\u2019t in-house or chosen with specific intent to promote specific policies, according to Randy Pepple, who was chief of staff for former Washington Republican AG Rob McKenna. In the New York case, a special interest is funding staffers who could wield state law-enforcement power to punish opponents.\n\nThe State Energy and Environmental Impact Center made clear that state AG offices would only qualify for special assistant AGs if they \u201cdemonstrate a need and commitment to defending environmental values and advancing progressive clean energy, climate change, and environmental legal positions,\u201d according to the August 2017 email to numerous AGs. Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office suggested in its application for the fellows that it \u201cneeds additional attorney resources to assist\u201d in extracting compensation from fossil-fuel emitters.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening. The New York AG currently has two NYU fellows on staff, according to the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center. ...\n\nA lack of government transparency makes this arrangement especially troubling. The New York AG\u2019s office, now run by Acting AG Barbara Underwood, declined to comment. ...\n\nThe State Energy and Environmental Impact Center said in a statement that the state offices it works with \u201chas the authority consistent with applicable law and regulations to accept a Legal Fellow whose salary and benefits are provided by an outside funding source.\u201d It added that it places workers with AGs who already have a long history of advancing the center\u2019s energy priorities. \u201cThe work that NYU law fellows perform is directed by those AGs and not by the Center,\u201d the Center said.\n\nAt least six state AG offices have already brought on board a special assistant attorney general, according to an August report by Mr. Horner. Besides New York, the jurisdictions include Maryland, Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington and the District of Columbia. In September, Mr. Horner learned that Illinois and New Mexico have brought on special assistant AGs as well, which was confirmed by the NYU outfit.\n\nThe ethical problems here should be obvious. Private interests are leveraging the police powers of the state to pursue their political agenda, while a government official is letting private interests appear to influence enforcement decisions. None of this is reassuring about the fair administration of justice.\n\nOnline: https://www.wsj.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 6\n\nThe Denver Post on Colorado electing the country\u2019s first openly gay man as governor:\n\nCongressman Jared Polis quietly made history Tuesday night. Early results indicate Colorado voters have made him the first openly gay governor to win election in America.\n\nPolis\u2019 sexual orientation was such a non-issue during the campaign that it would be easy to forget that in 2012 the question of whether same-sex couples could be joined by civil unions brought the Colorado General Assembly to a political meltdown. That six years later Polis, his partner Marlon Reis, and their two children are poised to become the first-family of Colorado is remarkable.\n\nWe went from a state where our elected officials struggled to provide even basic rights to same-sex couples to a state where a gay man ran for governor and his sexual orientation wasn\u2019t discussed as a political liability. Faith in humanity should be temporarily restored.\n\nDenver Post reporter Nic Garcia documented the decades of ground work it took to get to this point in his late-September analysis: \u201cFrom \u2018Hate State\u2019 to Jared Polis: How Colorado led the way for gay, transgender candidates to run for office \u2014 and win.\u201d\n\nThe story was a remarkable retrospective on how advocates responded to the 1992 passage of Amendment 2, which was a disgusting attempt to make it illegal to protect the LGBT community from discrimination. Garcia told the story of Equality Colorado, the Gay and Lesbian Fund, and One Colorado, rising up and fighting for civil rights in Colorado. And while ultimately it was the U.S. Supreme Court that legalized same-sex marriage across the nation, the grassroots work in Colorado was instrumental in fighting against the hardest thing of all to change: the hearts and minds of the 53 percent of voters who supported Amendment 2.\n\nBut as far as this state and this nation has come, it\u2019s important that we take a moment to note the historic significance of a Polis victory because there\u2019s much left to be done on the equality front in this nation.\n\nJust before the midterm elections, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration proposed rolling back policies put in place under President Barack Obama that provided protections for transgender individuals across many aspects of government. The rules in place ensured that transgender individuals would not face discrimination in gender-related programs like those in health care, schools or other benefits. There\u2019s not a single documented case of those new rules causing anyone harm, and yet the rules have been targeted for removal.\n\nSuch political maneuvers reinforce what we already know and simultaneously fear: it is popular and easy for politicians to turn their backs on minority populations who need the protection of the law the most.\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder too of the unresolved issues in Colorado. The U.S. Supreme Court punted on the question of whether a small business owner can be compelled by anti-discrimination laws to serve all customers equally even if it violates his or her religious beliefs. That is a true point of conflict that remains unresolved for the owner and customers of Masterpiece Cake Shop in Lakewood.\n\nOnline: https://www.denverpost.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 6\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune on North Ogden, Utah, Mayor Brent Taylor, the Army National Guard major killed in Afghanistan:\n\n\u201cI am the mayor of a small city with an $18 million budget. Our city council spends two full days in budget workshops and then many hours in subsequent meetings, as they meticulously review each individual line item and make modifications. In contrast, the full UTA Board spent only two total hours on this massive $600 million budget, did not review line item details, and basically rubber-stamped management\u2019s proposals.\u201d\n\n\u2014 North Ogden Mayor Brent Taylor in a Jan. 5 commentary in The Salt Lake Tribune\n\nBefore he was killed in an attack in Afghanistan last week, Brent Taylor fought the battle of Utah Transit Authority.\n\nThe North Ogden mayor \u2014 who wore the hats of father, soldier and politician \u2014 couldn\u2019t seem to do anything halfheartedly. When Taylor was chosen to represent Weber and Box Elder counties on the UTA board last year, the old guard at the transit agency was so unnerved they tried to deny him the appointment. They claimed it violated nepotism rules because his father was a FrontRunner train operator, and it took a ruling from State Auditor John Dougall to force the board to seat him.\n\nOnce he was on the board, Taylor did something other board members almost never did. He started questioning management\u2019s financial decisions. He challenged UTA\u2019s plan to borrow $88 million when it was already $2 billion in debt. He questioned why UTA drastically discounted passes for Utah Valley University and Brigham Young University students.\n\nUltimately, he fought to dismantle the board and replace it with a more functional system, and the Utah Legislature did exactly that while he was overseas.\n\nTaylor\u2019s tenacity in the face of so much bureaucratic inertia says mountains about a man who was taken too soon from his wife, his seven children, his fellow North Ogdenites and the entire state of Utah.\n\nPolitics for Taylor was about problem solving, not building fiefdoms or protecting turf. It\u2019s that attitude that led the Republican to join with Oscar Mata, a former executive director of Weber County Democrats, to form \u201cWeber County Forward.\u201d As with UTA, Taylor and Mata were looking to replace the county\u2019s three-commissioner government with a better system of checks and balances.\n\nUtah will never know how far Taylor\u2019s star would have risen. Three days after his commentary ran in The Tribune in January, he announced that he was taking a yearlong leave from being mayor to serve in Afghanistan. \u201cService is really what leadership is all about,\u201d Taylor said in his Facebook announcement.\n\nTrue enough, but leadership is also about courage. Brent Taylor was never afraid to do what is right.\n\nThe angels better be ready. Heaven just got a new reformer.\n\nOnline: https://www.sltrib.com/", "", "", "LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) \u2014 Mitchell Trubisky and the Chicago Bears\u2019 offense refuse to become mired in mistakes or popular assessments.\n\nTrubisky long ago ditched social media to focus his attention on operating coach Matt Nagy\u2019s new offense, and the result has been a 5-3 record and first place in the NFC North at the midpoint.\n\nWhile the Bears\u2019 defense is generally regarded as the major reason for Chicago\u2019s rise from last place, Trubisky sees the offense making stready strides forward heading into Sunday\u2019s divisional battle with the Detroit Lions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still areas I have to improve within my game and am still growing in that, but I feel comfortable and confident with where I am as a leader with command of this offense, getting in and out of the huddle, seeing things post-snap,\u201d Trubisky said. \u201cI think it\u2019s all starting to slow down, so just trying to improve all areas of my game.\u201d\n\nChicago\u2019s defense ranks fifth, but the Bears are fifth overall in scoring and also rank first in scoring after opposing turnovers (82 points). And while Trubisky has suffered from fits of wildness, his 96.1 passer rating is just .04 below Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford.\n\nTrubisky completed 28 of 49 for 355 yards with three touchdowns and an interception the last two games, and had several possible interceptions dropped.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that I can think of in regards to just our offense and not his accuracy, we\u2019ve played some pretty solid defenses here the last few weeks,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cI think they\u2019re underrated, especially the last two weeks with the Jets and Buffalo. Then you go back to the Patriots.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some good schemes and some good players, but that\u2019s good for us, that\u2019s good for him. There were a couple balls now and then that got away from him. He\u2019ll be the first to tell you. I\u2019ll be the first to let him know that, but that\u2019s OK. We\u2019ll keep improving.\u201d\n\nTeammates see improvement in Trubisky within the offense in so many ways, they\u2019re getting tired of talking about it.\n\n\u201cThis is like the 30th time I\u2019ve had that quetsion,\u201d running back Tarik Cohen said. \u201cI say the same thing every time. It\u2019s just him being more demanding of us as players and just his leadership outside of what the coaches are telling him \u2014 at the line of scrimmage, making those adjustments, audibles and things of that nature.\u201d\n\nTrubisky insisted at the outset of training camp that he\u2019s off social media for this season, so he said he\u2019s unaware of public criticism.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really check it that often and I don\u2019t really have it on my phone,\u201d Trubisky said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t hear any of the outside noise, whether it be positive or negative. I just have a lot more time, and my focus is elsewhere; within football and my family and everything else I\u2019ve got going on.\u201d\n\nSome players spend much of their off time on social media.\n\n\u201cMost of it last year had been negative, so it\u2019s just a lot of negativity that I blocked out of my life,\u201d Trubisky said. \u201cI\u2019m able to just focus on what I needed to do and who I want to be as a player and as a person. It has been a good thing for me just getting off that.\u201d\n\nTrubisky\u2019s accuracy has slipped at a time when he didn\u2019t have wide receiver Allen Robinson as a target due to a groin injury. But that could change this week. Robinson went through a full Wednesday practice for the first time since before missing two games after he tried to play through his injury.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible tight end Adam Shaheen could be back from a foot injury suffered in preseason.\n\nThe defense also had good injury news when linebacker Khalil Mack had his first full practice since suffering an ankle injury against Miami on Oct. 14.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to Trubisky and the offense to find a groove, even while heaviliy scrutinized.\n\n\u201cI think any time you are drafted as a quarterback early and high in the draft, you\u2019re always gonna be critiqued,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cBut again, the only thing that he needs to worry about is what I think about him and what people in this building think about him. Everybody\u2019s entitled to their opinion and that\u2019s OK, that\u2019s fine, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\n\n\u201cBut as long as he just understands that the only thing that matters is what we think, nothing will affect him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Owners of Brio and Bravo restaurants moving to Florida\n\nORLANDO, Fla.

Duncan Hunter, who won re-election while facing federal corruption charges, promised constituents Wednesday it will be \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d in his deeply red Southern California district, but some wonder whether that will be possible.\n\nHunter beat first-time Democratic candidate Ammar Campa-Najjar by more than eight percentage points in the San Diego-area district that President Donald Trump won by double digits in 2016.\n\nCampa-Najjar, a 29-year-old former Obama White House aide, said he would not concede until every vote had been counted, which could come later in the week.\n\nThe race was considered a test of partisanship in the Trump era and whether voters would overlook the taint of suspicion to keep the five-term lawmaker in his seat.\n\nHunter is one of the few candidates in U.S. history to be re-elected while indicted. He vowed Wednesday to continue his fight to rebuild the military, fortify the U.S. border, cut taxes and protect the 2nd Amendment.\n\n\u201cI intend to make it business-as-usual in working with President Trump for the next two years to achieve more success, especially given the challenge of having a Democrat-led House,\u201d Hunter said in a statement.\n\nHe is up against mounting challenges unlike any he has faced in his 10 years in office.\n\nHe and his wife are due back in court Dec. 3. A grand jury in August handed down a 60-count indictment against the couple alleging they used more than $250,000 in campaign money for personal expenses ranging from tequila shots to an Italy trip to dental work. They pleaded not guilty.\n\nRobert Knapp, 59, a Santee Republican who services trucks and buses, said he reluctantly voted for Hunter, but he did not want to see Republicans lose the seat. \u201cPersonally, I would have a difficult time focusing,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully he has good people around him to help him stay on track.\u201d\n\nHunter was one of two indicted Republican congressmen running for re-election. Rep. Chris Collins of New York is accused of insider trading. His race was too close to call Wednesday.\n\nBoth were early supporters of Trump and called the charges retribution for his election.\n\nTrump, however, did not officially endorse either candidate, though some say he could try to intervene to help the Republicans now that Democrats control the House.\n\nBill Wells, the conservative mayor of El Cajon, located in Hunter\u2019s district, said there\u2019s no doubt the case will be a distraction. \u201cIt\u2019s not a positive thing,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the faster this gets resolved, the better it will be for the district.\u201d\n\nWells ran against Hunter after it was announced the congressman was under federal investigation, but he lost in the June primary. He said his candidacy opened the door for other Republicans who were reluctant to run against the Hunter family, a political dynasty in the largely rural and suburban district east of San Diego.\n\nHunter\u2019s father was elected to the seat in 1980 and held it until his son was elected in 2008.\n\nWells declined to predict how things will end for Hunter, though he is still entertaining the idea of going for his seat again if the conditions are right.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Jason A. Forge expects the case to go to trial in 2019. Forge, who is now in private practice, said the indictment is full of evidence that he believes shows the prosecution\u2019s case is strong, and he expects a conviction.\n\n\u201cWhen you read between the lines in the indictment, there are a lot of bread crumbs there,\u201d Forge said.\n\nHunter\u2019s wife is also facing possible jail time and could opt to cooperate. Hunter has insinuated his wife, who was his campaign manager, was to blame for the misspending. But Forge said he does not believe she would testify against the father of their three children.\n\n\u201cBut who knows, the reality is those kids could wind up with both parents in jail at the same time,\u201d he said.\n\nNo law requires lawmakers who are convicted to step down, though most have under pressure. Otherwise they can face expulsion. If the seat is vacated, the governor would call a special election.\n\nHunter, a 41-year-old former Marine, has said he is eager to go to trial.\n\nA few lawmakers have been re-elected while indicted and gone on to be exonerated. More have been convicted and later resigned.\n\nIn 2014, Republican Rep. Michael Grimm of New York was re-elected while under indictment and later resigned after pleading guilty to tax evasion.

The Associated Press has not yet called the race.\n\nWith all precincts reporting, Harris leads McCready by less than 1,900 votes from 280,000 ballots cast.

Harris lost to Rep. Robert Pittenger in the 2016 GOP primary by 134 votes.

Saenz said Wednesday the agreement launches a long process allowing potential class action members to have a say in the case.\n\nUnder the proposal, Motel 6 could ultimately pay up to $8.9 million, including reimbursement of legal fees and administrative costs, Saenz said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very pleased with the settlement because it will provide for future protections and compensation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe civil rights group alleged that Motel 6 discriminated against Latino customers at two locations in Phoenix by sharing their whereabouts and personal information with U.S. immigration agents who later arrested at least seven guests.\n\nMotel 6 said last year that its Phoenix employees would no longer work with immigration authorities after the Phoenix New Times newspaper reported that workers were providing guests\u2019 names to agents.\n\nIn a tweet at the time, Motel 6 said: \u201cThis was implemented at the local level without the knowledge of senior management.\u201d\n\nThe Washington state attorney general also sued the chain in January, saying it had violated a state consumer protection law by providing the private information of thousands of guests to immigration agents without a warrant.

Jerry Brown talks about election results and a variety of other subjects during a news conference in his office at the Capitol in Sacramento, Calif., Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018. (AP Photo/Steve Yeater)\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California\u2019s outgoing governor, Democrat Jerry Brown, said Wednesday the deeply divided nation needs to find comity and common ground, even as his state\u2019s aggressive confrontation of President Donald Trump looks to accelerate under his successor.\n\nBrown is preparing to hand off power to Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who ran on his promise to stand up to Trump and promote California\u2019s liberal values.\n\n\u201cI see the central challenge of America is pulling itself together and minimizing the deepening divergence of our people,\u201d Brown told reporters in a rare availability in the Capitol office he\u2019ll vacate in two months.\n\nCalifornia must stand up for human rights and the environment, he said, \u201cbut we have to do it in a way that finds greater commonality, we have to maximize the sense of being Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen other countries that are pulling apart,\u201d Brown said. \u201cDemocracy\u2019s in trouble everywhere.\u201d\n\nBrown has relished the role of foil to Trump on some issues but also frustrated his party\u2019s liberal wing that\u2019s eager to much more aggressively confront Trump and enact an array of left-wing priorities like universal health care.\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t care for framing California\u2019s role as the \u201cresistance\u201d to Trump. Rather, he said, the state follows its own path and fights those who get in the way.\n\nBrown was responding to data from AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate, which found that 7 in 10 Californians disapprove of Trump and more than half said they were driven to the polls by their opposition to the president.\n\nHe noted with approval that U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, the party\u2019s leader in the House who is looking to be speaker, said she\u2019d be cautious and move slowly on investigating and potentially impeaching Trump.\n\nAccepting victory following Tuesday\u2019s election, Newsom took a confrontational tone toward Trump and presented California as the model for an approach to politics that\u2019s diametrically opposed to the president\u2019s views. He extolled the state\u2019s diversity \u2014 it is home to millions of immigrants, and Latinos make up the largest ethnic group \u2014 and its powerhouse economy.\n\n\u201cAt our best, we always stand up. We step in and we fight for what\u2019s right,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why California\u2019s dream is America\u2019s leading brand. Because California\u2019s dream will always be too big to fail and too powerful to bully.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters at a campaign stop in Sacramento last week, Newsom rejected a suggestion that he and Brown have different approaches to confronting Trump, noting both used harsh language to criticize the president.\n\nBrown, 80, leaves office on Jan. 7. He said he intends to use his remaining weeks to push for a negotiated agreement among water users long at war over the Sacramento-San Joaquin river delta east of San Francisco.\n\nAt the request of Brown and Newsom, a state water board delayed a vote scheduled for Wednesday on a plan to increase the amount of water allowed to flow through the Lower San Joaquin River and its tributaries to protect habitat for fish in the delta. The move would result in less water for farmers.\n\n\u201cA short extension will allow these negotiations to progress and could result in a faster, less contentious and more durable outcome,\u201d Newsom and Brown wrote in a letter dated Tuesday. Voluntary agreements are better than a government mandate that will inevitably lead to lawsuits, they wrote.\n\nThe Water Resources Control Board delayed the decision until Dec. 11.\n\nBrown also reiterated his support for building two massive tunnels underneath the delta to move water from Northern California to water users elsewhere, mainly the Central Valley and Southern California. He said bypassing the delta has been a priority since his father was governor in the 1960s.\n\n\u201cIf someone had a better way, we would have heard about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is another way.\u201d\n\nAs governor, Newsom will likely be working with a Democratic supermajority in the Legislature with the power to raise taxes without Republican votes, but Brown said he thinks lawmakers will be very reluctant to do so.\n\nBrown called providing government-funded insurance to everyone in the state \u2014 an idea known as \u201csingle-payer\u201d that\u2019s popular with liberal activists and embraced by Newsom \u2014 \u201can intriguing idea.\u201d But he said aside from the cost, it would take cooperation with the federal government. Estimated costs have been as high as $400 billion per year.\n\nBrown noted that Newsom has said he would likely have to phase it in.\n\n___\n\nCooper reported from Los Angeles.", "FOXBOROUGH, Mass.

Donald Spitz, an anti-abortion activist who stayed in contact with Shannon, said abortion-rights activists should not be worried about Shannon\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be doing anything violent,\u201d said Spitz, leader of Pro-Life Virginia and sponsor of the Army of God website. \u201cOf course, no one knows, but I\u2019d be very surprised.\u201d\n\nHe said he talked to Shannon on Monday and described her as upbeat about her release but said he didn\u2019t know Shannon\u2019s plans.\n\nShannon, now 62, was sentenced to 11 years behind bars for shooting and wounding Tiller, and 20 years for six firebombings and two acid attacks at abortion clinics in California, Oregon and Nevada.\n\nStephen Peifer, a former assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted Shannon in Portland in 1995, said Shannon could do something violent herself but it\u2019s more likely she would counsel other people to do so.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s completely unrehabilitated and totally incorrigible,\u201d Peifer said. \u201cShe has the same mentality and goals that she had when she was convicted.\u201d\n\nOn May 31, 2009, Tiller was shot and killed at his church in Wichita by Scott Roeder, an anti-abortion extremist who testified during his murder trial that he visited Shannon when she was imprisoned in Topeka.\n\nJulie Burkhart, a former employee of Tiller\u2019s and founder of Trust Women Foundation, which operates clinics in Wichita, Oklahoma City and Seattle, said Shannon\u2019s release \u201craises deep concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe tried to murder my boss,\u201d Burkhart said. \u201cAnd I absolutely do not believe under any circumstances that Shelley Shannon is reformed. She is still as dangerous today as she was in August of 1993.\u201d\n\nShannon was an Oregon homemaker when she took a bus to Oklahoma City, where she rented a car and drove to Tiller\u2019s clinic in Wichita. The clinic, Women\u2019s Health Care Services, was bombed in 1986 and was the focus of Operation Rescue\u2019s 46-day \u201cSummer of Mercy\u201d campaign in 1991 that resulted in more than 2,600 arrests.\n\nShannon shot Tiller as he drove out of the clinic parking lot. He was injured in both arms but returned to work the next day.\n\nAfter Shannon was arrested, police found a letter she\u2019d written to her daughter describing the shooting and denying that it was wrong.\n\n\u201cIt was the most holy, most righteous thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI have no regrets.\u201d\n\nInvestigators later found files on Shannon\u2019s computer detailing clinic arsons and acid attacks she had committed.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Kansas City Star, http://www.kcstar.com", "FILE -In this Oct. 28, 2018, file photo, Los Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley runs for a touchdown during the second half of an NFL football game against the Green Bay Packers in Los Angeles. With Gurley and Ezekiel Elliott of the Cowboys among a growing number of productive and important backs, it's a good time to be a runner again \u2014 not to mention the critical role that pass catching can play out of the backfield. (AP Photo/Denis Poroy, File)\n\nEzekiel Elliott likes to give Todd Gurley credit for the NFL\u2019s running renaissance because the Los Angeles Rams star ended an unprecedented two-year drought of backs taken in the first round of the draft.\n\nWith MVP-type numbers on a team looking like a Super Bowl contender, Gurley is the best example why it\u2019s a good time to be a running back not many years after the position seemed undervalued in what is still considered a passing league.\n\n\u201cDefinitely it\u2019s starting to re-emerge,\u201d said Elliott, who was the NFL rushing leader as a rookie in 2016 with the Dallas Cowboys. \u201cHe was the first one in that draft and then as the years went on, more backs started to get picked and they\u2019ve all been doing well. I wouldn\u2019t take all the credit, but I think it\u2019s just a new age of backs.\u201d\n\nAnd an age of young backs. Gurley went 10th overall to the Rams when they were in St. Louis, followed five picks later by Melvin Gordon to the Chargers when they were still in San Diego. Now both backs are in LA.\n\nElliott was the first of two straight rookies to win the rushing title, followed by Kansas City\u2019s Kareem Hunt last season. Among the top 10 rushers this season, eight are 25 or younger.\n\nThat\u2019s still not getting to New York Giants rookie Saquon Barkley , the No. 2 overall pick and highest back taken since Reggie Bush went second in 2006.\n\n\u201cI guess I kind of did start the first-round thing again,\u201d Gurley said. \u201cBut those guys are great players. They put themselves in great positions to be where they are at today, and you see why they are having success in the NFL.\u201d\n\nElliott got a top-four thing going when the Cowboys drafted the Ohio State star fourth overall in 2016. Now there have been three straight years with a back taken at least that high: Leonard Fournette fourth out of LSU the year in 2017, then Barkley from Penn State this year.\n\nThe other top 10 running back over the past three drafts also illustrates one reason runners could be in vogue: their ability as pass catchers. Carolina took Christian McCaffrey eighth overall out of Stanford last year, even with the perception he might be a third-down back.\n\nNow McCaffrey has a respectable 111 carries for the playoff-contending Panthers while ranking fourth among running backs with 49 catches.\n\n\u201cA lot of times teams that had a feature back, he was considered the first- and second-down guy, and then they put in a little scatback to be the third-down receiver,\u201d said Buffalo general manager Brandon Beane, who had a hand in drafting McCaffrey while with Carolina. \u201cWell, now, you\u2019re getting these guys that can do it all.\u201d\n\nHunt and Barkley have made it back-to-back seasons for rookies to start their careers with six or more straight games of at least 100 scrimmage yards. Barkley\u2019s run ended there, but now he\u2019s at seven of his first eight games despite another miserable season for the Giants (1-7).\n\nHunt started his career with seven straight last year \u2014 the first rookie to do that since Kevin Jones for Detroit in 2004.\n\nNot that multipurpose lead backs are a new thing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever matched how Marshall Faulk produced in the passing game, and that seems like 8 million years ago,\u201d Cowboys offensive coordinator Scott Linehan said of a back who was the 2000 NFL MVP in the middle of three straight years with at least 1,300 yards rushing and 800 receiving.\n\nOh, and Faulk was the second overall pick in 1994.\n\n\u201cI just think of these guys have been doing this stuff in this league for years,\u201d Linehan said. \u201cI think people probably targeted them because they\u2019re the best with the ball in their hands.\u201d\n\nGurley is well on his way to his first rushing title with 868 yards; leads the NFL with 16 touchdowns, including 12 rushing; and has a chance Sunday against Seattle to become just the fourth player with at least one TD in each of the first 10 games. The others are all Hall of Famers.\n\nThe former Georgia standout has a 162-yard lead over James Conner, the replacement for Le\u2019Veon Bell in Pittsburgh when Bell decided to stay away from the Steelers rather than play under the franchise tag.\n\nConner\u2019s emergence also shows the depth of the 2017 class \u2014 even with Fournette missing all but two games with a hamstring injury after rushing for 1,040 yards and nine touchdowns as a rookie for a team that reached the AFC championship game.\n\nThe second-year group has two of the NFL\u2019s top three rushers in Conner and Hunt, who have almost 1,400 yards and 16 rushing touchdowns between them, while Hunt has another six receiving TDs.\n\nThe versatility of 2017 Offensive Rookie of the Year Alvin Kamara helps quarterback Drew Brees in one of the NFL\u2019s best offenses in New Orleans. Dalvin Cook (Minnesota) and Joe Mixon (Cincinnati) are expected to play leading roles in their respective run games.\n\nAnd forget for a moment about the draft. Another second-year player, Matt Breida in San Francisco, is ninth in the NFL with 531 yards rushing after going undrafted. Denver rookie Phillip Lindsay is sixth at 591 after not getting selected.\n\n\u201cA lot of times there\u2019s a lot of backs in the draft,\u201d Washington coach Jay Gruden said. \u201cYou might be able to get one that\u2019s close in the second round, but you won\u2019t get that left tackle who\u2019s a star in the second round or that defensive lineman or that outside \u2019backer or that corner.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a different kind of renaissance with the Redskins: an \u201cold\u201d guy leading the way. Adrian Peterson, the 33-year-old three-time league rushing champ, has helped Washington to the NFC East lead by ranking fifth with 604 yards.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that position\u2019s ever been devalued,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI think you look at what Zeke\u2019s done and you look at some of the other young running backs, Le\u2019Veon Bell, and what type of impact they can have on your football team.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning that right now firsthand with Adrian Peterson. Even though we didn\u2019t draft him, obviously, but the impact these backs can have on your football as far as running game, controlling the clock and then the play-actions. It\u2019s big time.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been big at draft time recently as well.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer John Wawrow contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "", "STOCKTON, Calif.

(Katie Sweeney/NOAA Fisheries via AP, File)\n\nANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 An Alaska salmon boat skipper who killed endangered Steller sea lions with a shotgun and hindered an investigation has been fined $20,000 in federal court.\n\nJon Nichols, 31, of Cordova, was sentenced Tuesday to five years\u2019 probation, three months of home confinement and 400 hours of community service.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah Smith also ordered Nichols to publicly apologize in a national commercial fishing magazine.\n\nOne of Nichols\u2019 crewmen, Theodore \u201cTeddy\u201d Turgeon, 21, of Wasilla, also shot the endangered animals. He was sentenced to four years\u2019 probation, one month of home incarceration and 40 hours of community service. He was fined $5,000.\n\nSteller sea lions are the largest members of \u201ceared\u201d seals family, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and can live to be 20 to 30 years old. Females can reach nearly 580 pounds (263 kilograms) and males up to 1,245 pounds (565 kilograms) in the North Pacific Ocean. They get their name from the big males\u2019 intimidating roar as they protect harems.\n\nSteller sea lions are voracious feeders of fish. Adults eat upward of 6 percent of their body weight per day. They target fish that are always available such as pollock and cod as well as seasonally available fish such as herring and salmon.\n\nAfter a dramatic decline in numbers of Steller sea lions in Alaska, the National Marine Fisheries Service in 1990 listed them as threatened. The agency delisted the eastern population in November 2013.\n\nFederal officials investigated in 2015 after 15 Steller sea lions were found dead at the mouth of the Copper River near Cordova. Huge runs of sockeye and king salmon return to the river, starting in late spring.\n\nNichols was captain of the fishing boat Iron Hide. Investigators determined that between May and June 2015, Nichols regularly ordered crewmen to shoot at Steller sea lions using shotguns belonging to him and Turgeon.\n\nNichols shot animals himself and drove the boat toward sea lions to allow Turgeon or other crew members to get a better shot, prosecutors said.\n\n\u201cThis crew admitted to shooting over 50 rounds at sea lions and killing at least three of the 15 dead sea lions that rolled up in 2015,\u201d said Assistant U.S. Attorney Aunnie Steward, who prosecuted the case.\n\nThe court noted that other Copper River fishing crews likely also shot sea lions, Steward said.\n\n\u201cI would say collectively what was happening in that fishery at that time was some of the worst we\u2019ve seen in decades, if not ever,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Nichols learned that federal officers were looking into the sea lions deaths, Nichols obstructed the investigation by coordinating false stories among crew members.\n\nTurgeon, with the encouragement of Nichols, lied to enforcement officers. He told them no sea lions were shot and that the Iron Hide carried no guns, prosecutors said.\n\nMagistrate Smith commented that she hoped the sentences would provide deterrence to others, Steward said. The magistrate also noted that Nichols\u2019 obstruction was particularly serious.\n\n\u201cIt went on for about 15 months,\u201d Steward said. \u201cThe captain was working the whole time to keep his crew lying to federal agents,\u201d she said.\n\nNichols and Turgeon in June pleaded guilty to one count of illegal take of marine mammals.", "FILE - In a Wednesday, Aug. 1, 2018, file photo, Ronnie Anderson, left, an African-American man charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, stands with his lawyer Niles Haymer in front of a Confederate statue on the lawn of the East Feliciana Parish Courthouse, where he is facing the charge, in Clinton, La.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, File)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 A judge in southeastern Louisiana Wednesday rejected a motion by a black defendant to move a case because he worried the presence of a Confederate statue in front of the courthouse inhibits his ability to get a fair trial.\n\nRonnie Anderson is charged with illegal possession of a stolen firearm in East Feliciana Parish, which is about 110 miles (177 kilometers) northwest of New Orleans. Anderson and his lawyer, Niles Haymer, have argued the 30-foot-high (9-meter-high) statute of the unknown Confederate soldier erected in 1909 during the Jim Crow era in front of the courthouse is a \u201csymbol of oppression and racial intolerance.\u201d They filed a motion in September pushing for a change of venue.\n\n\u201cDefendant believes that this Confederate Monument displayed prominently in front of the East Feliciana Parish Courthouse carries a message to African Americans of intimidation and oppression, communicating that justice may not be fair and impartial at a Courthouse that was nostalgic and sentimental over the institution of slavery that the Confederacy fought for,\u201d the motion read.\n\nBut Haymer said Judge Kathryn Jones rejected the motion. Haymer says his defendant is weighing his options but if the case goes to trial as scheduled next February, he will plan to ask prospective jurors about the statue.\n\nDistrict Attorney Sam D\u2019Aquilla said he agrees with the judge\u2019s ruling and that the defendant failed to demonstrate any prejudice that would require the case to be moved.

(Thad Allton/The Topeka Capital-Journal via AP)\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Democrat Laura Kelly promised a new tone of bipartisanship after a victory in the Kansas governor\u2019s race brought her national attention. She faces a Republican-dominated Legislature with leaders who call her proposals impractical and vow to hold her to a pledge not to raise taxes.\n\nKelly, a veteran state senator from Topeka, defeated Republican firebrand Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state and an ally of President Donald Trump. She wooed GOP moderates and independent voters by pitching herself as a lawmaker who has worked across party lines.\n\nThe governor-elect declined to give interviews Wednesday and instead met privately with departing Republican Gov. Jeff Colyer, who was narrowly defeated by Kobach in the August primary. Kelly issued a statement after the meeting that declared \u201ca new era of cooperation.\u201d\n\nBut the same electorate that rejected Kobach\u2019s in-your-face conservative politics moved the Legislature further to the right. Kansas House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr. said Kelly had promised voters \u201ca free lunch,\u201d and Senate President Susan Wagle expressed doubts Wednesday that the state can afford a boost in funding for public schools and other goals Kelly outlined during her campaign.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have it all,\u201d Wagle said during an interview. \u201cIt costs money.\u201d\n\nWhile Kansas is deep red in its voter registration and presidential contests, fighting between conservative and moderate Republicans regularly creates openings for Democrats. Colyer took office in January when unpopular GOP Gov. Sam Brownback stepped down to take an ambassador\u2019s job in president Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nBrownback engineered deep income tax cuts in 2012-13, and huge budget problems and national infamy followed, causing voters to sour on the experiment. Bipartisan legislative majorities reversed most of the tax cuts last year and the 68-year-old Kelly, representing a GOP-leaning Senate district, was a key player as the Senate budget committee\u2019s top Democrat.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Kansas was a wave of common sense, a wave of bipartisanship,\u201d Kelly told cheering supporters in her victory speech. \u201cIt was Democrats and Republicans and independents all coming together to put our state back on track.\u201d\n\nKobach had promised to resume tax cutting \u2014 but also to reduce spending more aggressively than Brownback would to keep the books balanced. Still, Wagle said, Kelly was able to tag Kobach as \u201cBrownback 2.0\u201d \u2014 and the description resonated with many voters.\n\n\u201cHe aligns himself too closely with the things I didn\u2019t like about Brownback,\u201d Kevin Graham, a 33-year-old truck driver and unaffiliated voter from the Kansas City area, said after casting his ballot for Kelly. \u201cI really didn\u2019t like Brownback.\u201d\n\nDown-ballot the story appeared different, with all 125 seats in the Kansas House on the ballot and a special election in one of the 40 state Senate districts.\n\nUnofficial results showed a net loss of one seat in the House for the Democrats, giving Republicans an 86-39 majority. In the Republican primary in August, conservatives had a net gain of at least five seats.\n\nState Rep. Stan Frownfelter, of Kansas City, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, said conservatives may have as many as 60 solid votes \u2014 three shy of what\u2019s needed to pass or block legislation.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be tougher,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Senate still has its GOP majority of 30-9, with one independent. Conservatives usually can count on 15 solid votes and pick up more Republicans, depending on the issue. Twenty-one votes are needed to pass legislation.\n\nThe new governor-elect\u2019s goals include a further increase in spending on public schools to comply with Kansas Supreme Court mandates in an ongoing education funding lawsuit.\n\nKelly supported a law enacted this year \u2014 that Kobach criticized \u2014 to phase in a $548 million increase in funding over five years. The court said the state needs to boost spending further to account for inflation, perhaps another $90 million a year.\n\n\u201cWe will no longer get by doing the minimum,\u201d Kelly said during her victory speech. \u201cWe will truly invest in our children\u2019s futures.\u201d\n\nKelly wants Kansas to expand its Medicaid health coverage in line with the 2010 federal Affordable Care Act, something Brownback and Colyer stymied. Voters in Republican-leaning Idaho and Nebraska, approved expansions Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s long past time to expand Medicaid,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nTop Republican lawmakers still strongly oppose expanding Medicaid, viewing it as potentially too costly for the state, despite the federal government\u2019s promise to cover most of the cost.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, a Topeka Democrat, sees some hope of influencing moderate GOP legislators by pointing to Kelly\u2019s solid margin of victory over Kobach, about 4.5 percentage points.\n\n\u201cIt sends a signal to people that we\u2019re going to have to have a period of bipartisan coalition building,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nFollow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna.", "FILE - In this Aug. 26, 2016, file photo, a one-month dosage of hormonal birth control pills is displayed in Sacramento, Calif.

Whitaker, 49, will become the nation\u2019s acting attorney general following the forced resignation of Jeff Sessions. President Donald Trump announced the appointment Wednesday, saying on Twitter that Whitaker \u201cwill serve our Country well\u201d and that a permanent attorney general will be nominated later.\n\nThe former federal prosecutor served as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff for one year.\n\nThe bulk of Whitaker\u2019s relevant experience came when he served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa from 2004 until 2009, a position for which he was recommended by Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, now chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In that role, the telegenic former college football player managed attorneys who prosecuted federal crimes and represented the government in civil matters in half of Iowa.\n\nRecent acting and permanent attorneys general have been longtime government lawyers or high-ranking politicians with more experience navigating Washington than Whitaker.\n\nCritics worry that Whitaker may be unlikely or unwilling to defend the Department of Justice\u2019s independence against political interference by the White House, given his history of partisanship and loyalty to Trump. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday that Whitaker should recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation given his previous public comments that appeared to exhibit hostility toward the inquiry.\n\nDuring a brief stint last year as a conservative legal commentator on CNN, Whitaker often appeared as a Trump defender, saying he saw no evidence the president colluded with Russians during the 2016 campaign or obstructed justice.

This would not only be out of character for a respected figure like Mueller, but also could be damaging to the President of the United States and his family \u2014 and by extension, to the country,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe also said on CNN last year that he could see a scenario in which Sessions\u2019 replacement doesn\u2019t fire Mueller but \u201cjust reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\u201d\n\nAsked whether Whitaker would assume control over Mueller\u2019s investigation, Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Flores said Whitaker would be \u201cin charge of all matters under the purview of the Department of Justice.\u201d The agency did not announce a departure for Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller and has closely overseen his work.\n\nDes Moines attorney Guy Cook, a Democrat who has known Whitaker for years, called him a clear thinker and a \u201cno-nonsense guy who is not to be underestimated.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I think most importantly, from the president\u2019s perspective, he\u2019s loyal,\u201d Cook said. He said that reasonable people can agree with Whitaker\u2019s perspective on the Mueller investigation, but \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s something that got the president\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nGrassley said Whitaker \u201cwill work hard and make us proud,\u201d saying that the department would be in good hands during the transition.\n\nMost of Whitaker\u2019s career has been spent in private practice, including at a Des Moines law firm he founded with other Republican Party activists in 2009. He has twice failed in bids for statewide elected office, most recently losing the 2014 GOP primary for the U.S. Senate to now-Sen. Joni Ernst.\n\nAfter that campaign, Whitaker helped start and served for three years as executive director for the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a self-described \u201cethics watchdog\u201d that often targets Democratic officials and groups with misconduct investigations and complaints. He has said that Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted for her email scandal as secretary of state and that Trump made the right call in firing FBI Director James Comey. He earned $402,000 in 2016, the group\u2019s tax filing shows.\n\nWhitaker has also cultivated close relationships with Republican leaders and activists during the Iowa caucuses, the first-in-the-nation presidential nominating contests that occur every four years. He served as state chairman during the 2012 election cycle for former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty\u2019s campaign. After Pawlenty\u2019s bid fizzled, he served in the 2012 and 2016 presidential campaigns of Rick Perry, the former Texas governor who is now energy secretary.\n\nWhitaker grew up in the Des Moines suburb of Ankeny. He attended the University of Iowa on a football scholarship, playing tight end under the legendary coach Hayden Fry and catching a pass for the Hawkeyes in the 1991 Rose Bowl. He majored in communications studies as an undergraduate and was interested in broadcasting and film production. He later earned an MBA and a law degree from the school.\n\nAfter starting his career in private practice, Whitaker first ran for office in 2002, losing a race for state treasurer to longtime Democratic incumbent Michael Fitzgerald. President George W. Bush appointed him as the U.S. attorney based in Des Moines in 2004.\n\nDuring his tenure, his office was accused of having political motivations in bringing an extortion charge against then-Democratic state Sen. Matt McCoy, which stemmed from a dispute McCoy had with a business partner. Whitaker denied that accusation, and McCoy was acquitted at a 2007 trial.", "FILE - This undated file photo released by the FBI, shows Amor Ftouhi, of Canada.

Nearly all the migrants at the terminal said the same thing: Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but they intend to try again. (AP Photo/Moises Castillo)\n\nSAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras (AP) \u2014 The Metropolitan Grand Central bus terminal in this city where the migrant caravan traveling through Mexico originated more than three weeks ago is a place of crossing destinies for Hondurans dreaming of seeking a better life in the United States.\n\nSome of the dozens of people sleeping on the concrete floor or outside on the grass underneath palm trees bathed by the light of street lamps are awaiting buses to the Guatemalan border to begin the journey north. Others are arriving after failing to complete the trip and are being ferried back to the precarious lives they left behind.\n\nHundreds of the mostly Honduran migrants who set out with the caravan that has traversed hundreds of miles through three countries before arriving in Mexico City this week have returned home, according to the Mexican government. Some grew disillusioned. Others simply wore out. Still others were detained and returned, or gave up on waiting for possible asylum in Mexico and accepted bus rides back home.\n\nDisembarking at the bus station in San Pedro Sula, nearly all of those returning said the same thing: Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but they intend to try again.\n\n\u201cI would go 30 times more if possible,\u201d said Daniel Castaneda, an 18-year-old from the central city of Comayagua. He was detained shortly after migrants in a caravan following in the footsteps of the first one clashed with police on a bridge on the Mexican border with Guatemala late last month.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say when, but I am going to keep going. ... This country is going to be left empty,\u201d he said.\n\nReny Maudiel a fresh-faced 16-year-old in a green T-shirt, a mop of curly hair sticking skyward from his head, said he was turned off by the violence of last month\u2019s border clashes. He was also exhausted, and his feet hurt \u2014 but already his mind was turning northward.\n\n\u201cI hope another opportunity emerges,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile U.S. President Donald Trump seized on the caravan as a campaign issue for Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections and suggested that criminals had infiltrated the group, the migrants say they are fleeing poverty, lack of jobs and rampant violence.\n\nIn a country that is one of the world\u2019s deadliest by homicide rates, San Pedro Sula is among the most violent cities as the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13 street gang, fights street-by-street with the rival 18th Street gang for territory. It\u2019s also seen a harsh crackdown by security forces including documented abuses. Nationwide nearly two-thirds of Hondurans, or some 5.5 million people, live in poverty, according to the World Bank.\n\nPablo Alba choked up thinking about how his 11-year-old son wrapped his arms around his neck and begged to be taken on the journey north. Alba said no, not wanting the boy to risk the arduous trek.\n\n\u201cIf there must be suffering, I will go alone,\u201d he said, recalling that Oct. 13 day when he set off to join the caravan with only the clothes on his back.\n\nThe 64-year-old had never thought about emigrating before because he had always been able to find work. A trained veterinarian, he ended up selling tamales cooked by his landlady, and it wasn\u2019t nearly enough to support his family.\n\nMexican authorities say some 3,230 migrants from the caravan have requested refuge. Alba used to be one of them. But shut in at an immigration center and unable to communicate with his children \u2014 he had no money or cell phone \u2014 he dropped his application and agreed to return to Honduras. Some 480 others have done the same, according to the Mexican government.\n\nHe intends to try again in March \u2014 only this time he will bring his kids.\n\nAccording to data from Mexico\u2019s National Immigration Institute, on average 136 Honduran migrants per day have been returned to their country this year. Women and children are taken directly to a shelter in San Pedro Sula. Men go by bus to the Caribbean coastal city of Omoa, and from there are transferred to the San Pedro terminal.\n\nSome days they\u2019re met at the bus station by government officials sitting behind a plastic table offering \u201csolidarity bags\u201d of basic goods such as rice and dried spaghetti, along with a photo of President Juan Orlando Hernandez and a note saying it comes from his government.\n\nJorge Marquez said they were taking returnees\u2019 information to \u201cfollow up with them\u201d and allow them to benefit from aid that Hernandez has promised in response to the caravan, which at its peak numbered more than 7,000 people.\n\nBut such vows largely ring hollow in this deeply troubled and politically unstable country. In interviews with The Associated Press, most returnees said they faced only a bleak future if they remained in Honduras.\n\nHowever, some, like Gerardo Castillo, a 35-year-old mason, did find encouragement in promises by Mexico\u2019s President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office Dec. 1, to give special visas to Central Americans to work in his country.\n\nCastillo, who left two children back home in Olancho and has two more in the United States, complained that immigration agents under the current Mexican administration were detaining migrants who separated from the main caravan, as happened to him. In Lopez Obrador, he sees a possible future in Mexico.\n\n\u201cOn Dec. 1, I will be in Tecun Uman,\u201d Castillo said, referring to the Guatemalan city across the river border from Mexico.\n\nOlvin Fernando Murillo, 20, made it almost 200 miles (300 kilometers) north of that crossing to the town of Arriaga \u2014 still far from Phoenix, Arizona, where a brother lives.\n\nThat\u2019s when his 16-year-old girlfriend got sick. When it became clear she wasn\u2019t getting better they decided to return to their Honduran hometown of El Paraiso on the border with Nicaragua.\n\nHe sold his cellphone to raise a bit of money and had little more than a donated green backpack he picked up after crossing into Mexico.\n\nBut his plans were clear. \u201cTo rest for a while, and in January, another caravan,\u201d he said.\n\nRumors that yet more caravans will form are flying in every corner of Honduras. They\u2019re attractive for the perception that they provide safety in numbers, and because they\u2019re a way to avoid paying thousands of dollars to a smuggler.\n\nBut the reality is far less certain.\n\nThose few who make it to the United States face a tough road to be able to stay legally; poverty and violence are not supposed to be considered as qualifying factors for asylum. Trump has talked of making asylum even more difficult, of detaining applicants in tent cities and of sending 15,000 U.S. troops to the southern border.\n\nStill, 27-year-old Claudia Noriega was determined to risk it, saying she can no longer make a living selling sweets since sugar prices have soared. She was aware she could end up back here in a few weeks\u2019 time, just like the men sleeping on the bus terminal floor.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is to try,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t, you\u2019ll have to see what to do then.\u201d", "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 California voters authorized $6 billion in bond funding for affordable housing as the state faces a severe shortage of homes.\n\nProposition 1 passed Wednesday with 54 percent support.

The money will be repaid over time with interest.\n\nIt joins Proposition 2 that passed by a wider margin and authorizes $2 billion in bond funding to house mentally ill homeless people.\n\nLawmakers approved those bonds in 2016, planning to repay them with funds from a tax on millionaires that voters approved in 2004.

King beat Democratic challenger J.D. Scholten. (Tim Hynds/Sioux City Journal via AP)\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 After eking out a narrow election victory after allegations he had met white supremacists, Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King promised Wednesday to even more forcefully state his views in the future, saying his \u201chead is bloodied but unbowed.\u201d\n\nThe victory over Democrat J.D. Scholten came amid outcry over his association with white supremacist groups, which he says is false, and his hardline views on immigration, abortion and gun rights. King, 69, claimed his reputation has been sullied by these election attacks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to march through this. I\u2019m going to take on all charges, take on all challengers. We\u2019re going to fight to put this record in order,\u201d he said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\nKing said he appeared to be cruising to an easy victory, with some polls showing him 20 points ahead. He said unexpected attacks began after news reports surfaced in September and October about his stance on immigration \u2014 he was described in one as \u201cthe most anti-immigrant member of Congress\u201d \u2014 and a trip he took to Austria and his meeting there with members of the Freedom Party, which is associated with a man once active in neo-Nazi circles.\n\nOrganizations and individuals stirred by the allegations poured money into the Scholten campaign, giving it millions of dollars for television ads.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody in America has taken that kind of nasty, negative, dishonest attack and withstood it,\u201d King said.\n\nSince he\u2019s had no need to run television ads in previous elections and hasn\u2019t had to raise money like other candidates, his campaign wasn\u2019t prepared to match the onslaught . He estimated he spent around $130,000 for advertising this campaign against Scholten\u2019s millions.\n\nScholten\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to messages.\n\nKing also vowed he\u2019ll no longer passively allow news media or opponents mischaracterize his statements or take them out of context.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019m changing,\u201d King said. \u201cI have refused all these years to defend myself of these baseless charges. I will be defending myself.\u201d\n\nHe banned Iowa\u2019s largest newspaper from his election night events in Sioux City. King\u2019s son, Jeff King, said the campaign denied credentials to The Des Moines Register and \u201cany other leftist propaganda media outlet with no concern for reporting the truth.\u201d\n\nSteve King said he\u2019s hesitated to hold previously announced town hall meetings because opponents like to hijack them for their own publicity, but he plans on doing them again.\n\nKing, a construction company owner, began his career in politics in 1996, when he was elected to the Iowa Senate. He was re-elected in 2000 but opted to run for an open seat in Congress in 2002 created through redistricting and has served the rural, agricultural 4th District since.\n\nSince first winning election to the U.S. House, King\u2019s vote total has dipped below 60 percent only twice. He defeated Scholten on Tuesday with just 50 percent of the vote.\n\nAs a state senator, he\u2019s credited with drafting the Iowa law that is considered one of the most restrictive abortion measures in the nation because it bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected. It has been repeatedly challenged in the courts, but advocates hope it will be the case that finally leads to the reversal of legalized abortion in the U.S.\n\nHis firm belief on abortion is one of the reasons he believes wealthy donors from the East and West coasts wanted to defeat him.\n\n\u201cIf they think this is going to intimidate me into backing off of these values we believe in, they\u2019re going to find out otherwise day by day and day a night because it never was about a political position,\u201d he told supporters Tuesday night. \u201cIt was always about a conviction and a calling.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow David Pitt on Twitter: https://twitter.com/davepitt", "Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic (15) gestures after making a 3-point basket against the Chicago Bulls during overtime of an NBA basketball game Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2018, in Chicago.

(Octavio Jones/The Tampa Bay Times via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For all the many successes among candidates of color, the midterm elections also proved to some the enduring power of racism, with minority politicians\u2019 intelligence and integrity called into question by their opponents and President Donald Trump in what were widely seen as coded appeals to white voters.\n\nSeveral Democratic strategists said Wednesday that the outcome showed the need for the party to recalibrate its strategy heading into 2020 and beyond.\n\nTo win, they said, the party must expand its base of black and brown voters while also calling out racism more directly and doing more to persuade white voters to reject bigotry.\n\n\u201cAt some point, voters have to stop rewarding racist behavior,\u201d said activist Brittany Packnett.\n\nDuring the campaign cycle, Trump referred to black Tallahassee mayor and Democratic candidate for Florida governor Andrew Gillum as \u201ca thief\u201d because of an undercover FBI investigation into his acceptance of Broadway tickets. Trump also branded Gillum\u2019s city \u201ccorrupt.\u201d\n\nAnd he framed Yale Law School graduate, veteran lawmaker and Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, a black woman, as incompetent.\n\nRepublican Ron DeSantis, who beat Gillum on Tuesday, began the campaign by cautioning Florida voters not to \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by voting for the Democrat \u2014 a remark that was also decried as racist.\n\nIn the end, Gillum came within less than 56,000 votes of DeSantis. In Georgia, the contest for governor was still too close to call on Wednesday.\n\nThere were also campaigns around the country where allegations of racism were not enough to knock the candidate out of the running.

(AP Photo/Rui Vieira)\n\nMANCHESTER, England (AP) \u2014 Raheem Sterling went from the farcical to the sublime in helping Manchester City to a 6-0 win over Shakhtar Donetsk and the brink of qualifying for the Champions League knockout stage on Wednesday.\n\nThe England winger provided the main talking point in another convincing victory for City when he stubbed his toe in the turf as he attempted a shot in the 24th minute and toppled over. Referee Viktor Kassai awarded a penalty despite there being no contact with a defender \u2014 much to the amazement of Shakhtar\u2019s players, some of whom even laughed at the decision \u2014 and Gabriel Jesus converted the spot kick for 2-0 and the first of his three goals on the night.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like to score a goal in that situation,\u201d City manager Pep Guardiola said. \u201cIt was really clear.\u201d\n\nSterling showed much more poise in scoring City\u2019s third goal, by picking up the ball 40 meters out, powering through two would-be tacklers and curling a fierce shot into the top corner from the edge of the area in the 48th. It was the run and finish of a man in form, with Sterling having scored twice in the Premier League this past weekend as well.\n\nJesus made it 4-0 in the 72nd, again from the penalty spot after David Silva was tripped by Taras Stepanenko, before Riyad Mahrez and Jesus \u2014 with a goal that completed his hat trick \u2014 wrapped up the scoring. Silva had put City 1-0 ahead with a close-range finish in the 13th.\n\nCity stayed in first place in Group F, but moved three points ahead of Lyon after the French club drew 2-2 against Hoffenheim. The English champions need one more point from their last two games to be certain of a top-two finish.\n\nAfter City\u2019s latest attacking masterclass, it was the penalty decision \u2014 given by a referee who has officiated in a Champions League final and in World Cups \u2014 that will best be remembered. It led to Sterling trending worldwide on social media.\n\nIt was so obvious that Sterling tripped himself over, rather than being fouled by chasing Shakhtar defender Mykola Matvyenko, that Guardiola covered his face with his hands after the incident before wagging his finger toward his own bench , indicating the penalty should not have been awarded. Sergio Aguero, a substitute sitting just in front of Guardiola, had a smile on his face.\n\nThe official behind the goal \u2014 used in UEFA-run competitions instead of a video assistant referee \u2014 appeared to have a good view of the trip but somehow didn\u2019t spot it.\n\n\u201cThe referees, I said a long time ago, must be helped,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThey want to make a good performance, they don\u2019t want to make mistakes. But today the game is quick, fast; the players are more skilled.\n\n\u201cIt takes three seconds, four seconds, 10 seconds, for someone involved to say it\u2019s no penalty, carry on.\u201d\n\nSterling looked slightly sheepish as he walked away from the spot where he fell, and didn\u2019t tell the referee there had been no contact from an opponent.\n\nAsked if Sterling could have owned up, Guardiola said \u201che could do that, yes\u201d before pointing to a goal City had wrongly disallowed in the second leg of last season\u2019s quarterfinal against Liverpool.\n\nCity has scored 23 goals in its last six games in all competitions, heading into a derby against Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "ASHEVILLE, N.C.

Democrats defeated Republican Govs. Scott Walker in Wisconsin and Bruce Rauner in Illinois while picking up open seats previously held by Republican governors in Michigan and Kansas.\n\nDemocrats also flipped control of governors\u2019 offices being vacated by Republicans in Maine, Nevada and New Mexico.\n\nThe Democratic Governors Association said it was their greatest number of pickups since 1982, the first midterm election of Republican President Ronald Reagan. The Democratic group\u2019s chairman, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, called it \u201ca broad-based win\u201d and a historically big rejection of the president\u2019s party.\n\n\u201cFor those who were troubled by the results of 2016 in the Midwest, we have proved that the Democrats can run and win,\u201d Inslee said.\n\nYet Republicans held on to the governor\u2019s office in other key swing states targeted by Democrats, including Florida, Ohio and Iowa. Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp also was leading in Georgia\u2019s gubernatorial race, though Democrat Stacey Abrams held out hope that absentee and the provisional ballots remaining to be counted could push Kemp\u2019s percentage below 50 percent and force a runoff.\n\nRepublicans picked up one new governor\u2019s office \u2014 a seat previously held by an independent in Alaska.\n\nRepublicans entered Tuesday\u2019s election controlling 33 governors\u2019 offices and two-thirds of the 99 state legislative chambers. The Democratic gubernatorial victories will push that closer to an even split. But Republicans will still control at least three-fifths of the state legislative chambers, even after Democrats flipped about a half-dozen chambers.\n\nThe gubernatorial and legislative gains appeared to give Democrats new trifectas of power in Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Mexico and New York. Democrats also broke up existing Republican trifectas in Kansas, Michigan, New Hampshire and Wisconsin.\n\nDemocrats ended a Republican legislative supermajority in North Carolina, making it harder for the GOP to override vetoes by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper.\n\nYet even after Tuesday\u2019s victories, Democrats still will have full control of the governor\u2019s office and legislature in about one-third fewer states than Republicans.\n\nThe Democratic gains amount to a mere \u201cripple\u201d in Republican legislative control, said Matt Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee.\n\n\u201cIt is not a wave, and I would say it\u2019s a far cry short of what they should have done\u201d during a midterm election in which Republicans had to defend far more seats, Walter said.\n\nDuring the first midterm election of Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure in 2010, Republicans picked up about 725 state legislative seats while flipping control of 21 chambers. Republicans then used that enhanced power in many states to redraw legislative districts to their favor after the 2010 Census.\n\nTuesday\u2019s shift of about a half-dozen chambers for Democrats is well below the average of 12 chamber changes per election cycle dating back 1900, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nWhereas \u201cObama\u2019s first midterm was a wipeout for Democrats,\u201d the Republican losses Tuesday are \u201crelatively modest,\u201d said NCSL elections analyst Tim Storey.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because Democrats are still \u201crunning on mostly Republican-drawn maps,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans were trying to put themselves in a strong position for the elections in two years, which will determine which party will have the upper hand in redrawing congressional and state legislative districts after the 2020 Census. But that jostling for power will matter less in some states as a result of Tuesday\u2019s elections.\n\nVoters in Colorado, Michigan and Missouri approved ballot measures overhauling the redistricting process in ways that are intended to reduce the likelihood of partisan gerrymandering by either major party. The Colorado and Michigan measures set up independent commissions to handle the task instead of leaving it to lawmakers and the governor.\n\nThe Missouri measure keeps in place an existing bipartisan commission for state legislative districts but creates a new position of nonpartisan state demographer to draft maps that prioritize \u201cpartisan fairness\u201d and \u201ccompetitiveness.\u201d\n\n__\n\nFollow David A.

(AP) \u2014 North Carolina Democrats will have more influence when state government policies are hammered out compared to the past six years once more of the party\u2019s legislators take their seats in January.\n\nRepublican lawmakers \u2014 weakened but still in charge of the General Assembly after Tuesday\u2019s elections \u2014 will face negotiations with Democrats like Gov. Roy Cooper, whose vetoes will carry much greater heft and could scuttle GOP plans.\n\nDemocrats picked up at least 11 additional legislative seats and led in four others that could be subject to recounts.\n\nRegardless, Democrats will have at least 53 of the 120 seats in the House, well above the 49 required to end the GOP\u2019s veto-proof majority in the chamber. Democrats will have at least 18 of the Senate\u2019s 50 seats, and would end the GOP supermajority there, too, if they hold on and win all three very close races.\n\n\u201cThis election was a reset for the General Assembly, putting a much-needed check on the power of the supermajority,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Dan Blue of Wake County said in a release.\n\nOn top of the defeats of two constitutional amendments to erode gubernatorial powers over judicial vacancies and the election board and another victory on the state Supreme Court, Democrats made headway toward regaining the legislature they lost in 2010 and becoming level with Republicans in state government.\n\n\u201cI think people want us to be a centrist state where parties work together,\u201d Rep. Graig Meyer of Orange County, who helped recruit Democratic candidates, said in an interview. Meyer added the legislative victories, along with the rejection of constitutional referendums, show voters are tired of \u201cbullying\u201d tactics by Republican legislators.\n\nWhile the executive and legislative branches have worked together this fall on Hurricane Florence relief, Republican legislative leaders aren\u2019t conceding the ground they\u2019ve taken since 2013, when both chambers began holding veto-proof majorities simultaneously. Since Cooper took office, 20 of his 25 vetoes have been overridden.\n\nIn a release, House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger pointed out the party would still \u201creturn a strong majority\u201d to both chambers. Berger said the outcome shows voters support the GOP agenda, particularly on lower taxes and controlled spending.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question the Democrats would like to spend more money,\u201d Berger said in an interview Wednesday with The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what capacity we have for additional spending, and how we should prioritize those dollars.\u201d\n\nMeyer said he\u2019s hopeful the Democrats\u2019 increased strength will mean passage of a law expanding Medicaid to cover hundreds of thousands of uninsured people through the 2010 federal health care overhaul. Legislative Republicans have repeatedly refused to consider expansion. Cooper also has sought to block further corporate income tax cuts and phase out taxpayer-funded scholarships to K-12 students to attend private schools \u2014 items Republicans are unlikely to give up.\n\nWhile heavily involved in candidate fundraising for Democrats to \u201cBreak the Majority,\u201d the governor offered a low-key response Wednesday to the election results.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolinians sent a strong message to the legislature that they want their state leaders to find more common ground and work better with the governor,\u201d Cooper spokeswoman Sadie Weiner said in a release, citing health care, education, the environment and Florence recovery.\n\nThe dynamics could resemble what occurred in 2011 and 2012, when Democrat Beverly Perdue was governor and House Republicans were four seats short of a veto-proof majority. Then-Speaker Thom Tillis had to persuade rural Democrats to join Republicans to override Perdue\u2019s vetoes. But the number of such conservative Democrats has dwindled since then.\n\n\u201cAs the majority I think we have a certain responsibility to make sure that budgets get adopted, that policies move forward,\u201d said Berger, who is seeking a fifth two-year term as Senate leader. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t forestall, it seems to me, the possibility of us working with the governor and trying to reach some accommodation.\u201d\n\nThe stakes for the next two-year session will be huge. Whatever happens will serve as a backdrop for Cooper\u2019s 2020 re-election bid, and the parties that win the House and Senate that year will be in charge of the redistricting of legislative boundaries for the next decade.\n\nThe current two-year session of the General Assembly isn\u2019t over.\n\nRepublican lawmakers planned months ago to return Nov. 27 to implement laws associated with the constitutional amendments that were approved. With two questions defeated, the focus likely will be on passing a law carrying out the voter identification mandate approved Tuesday. Democrats are worried Republicans will unveil other legislation they wish to push through before the GOP\u2019s veto-proof control ends.", "Real midfielder Gareth Bale celebrates after scoring his side's fourth goal during the Champions League group G soccer match between Real Madrid and Viktoria Plzen at the Doosan arena in Pilsen, Czech Republic, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018. (AP Photo/Petr David Josek)\n\nPLZEN, Czech Republic (AP) \u2014 Santiago Solari\u2019s chances of staying in charge of Real Madrid keep getting better.\n\nSolari\u2019s resurgent Madrid routed Viktoria Plzen 5-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday, winning its third straight match in all competition since the interim coach took over to replace the fired Julen Lopetegui.\n\nKarim Benzema scored twice and Casemiro, Gareth Bale and Toni Kroos also netted for the three-time defending champions, leaving Madrid level on nine points with Roma, which won 2-1 at CSKA Moscow earlier Wednesday in Group G.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to win 5-0 away in the Champions League and not play a great game,\u201d said Solari, who was only hired on an interim basis but hasn\u2019t been ruled out as a candidate for the permanent job. \u201cI\u2019m very happy, but this was all about the players, it\u2019s their merit.\u201d\n\nSolari said he is only thinking about the next match, not about keeping his position. But players didn\u2019t hide that they are behind the former Madrid player.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Benzema said. \u201cWe are doing well with him, he should stay until the end of the season. He is a great coach. We are playing with more confidence.\u201d\n\nMadrid and Roma can both seal a place in the knockout stage with one win from their final two games.\n\nCzech champion Viktoria Plzen, playing in the group stage for the first time since 2013, stayed on one point and was eliminated.\n\nMadrid had struggled in a 2-1 win over Viktoria Plzen at home in the team\u2019s second-to-last match under Lopetegui, who was eventually fired after a demoralizing 5-1 loss to Barcelona at Camp Nou Stadium.\n\nMadrid has outscored opponents 11-0 with former player Solari. The Spanish team lost five of its last seven matches with Lopetegui, conceding 13 goals and scoring four.\n\nThe Czech hosts started well and almost opened the scoring when Madrid defender Nacho Fernandez deflected a ball onto the crossbar.\n\nMadrid struggled to control the game until Benzema\u2019s superb goal in the 21st minute. The French striker entered the area and cleared three defenders before sending a low shot underneath goalkeeper Ales Hruska.\n\n\u201cI play football to make history,\u201d said Benzema, who now has 201 goals with Madrid. \u201cSometimes people don\u2019t really understand what I do on the pitch. I\u2019m there to help my teammates as well as score goals. For me the important thing always is winning.\u201d\n\nIt got better still for Madrid when Casemiro, in his 50th Champions League appearance, added to the lead two minutes later with a header from a corner. Benzema netted his second goal with a header after being set up by Gareth Bale, and the Wales forward found the net in the 40th from inside the area. Kroos closed the scoring with a second-half lob over Hruska after a pass by substitute Vinicius Junior, the young Brazilian who was making his Champions League debut.\n\n\u201cIt was hard blow for our confidence and it was difficult to cope with it,\u201d Viktoria Plzen coach Pavel Vrba said.\n\nSolari, a former Argentina and Madrid midfielder, took over the main squad after coaching Madrid\u2019s \u201cB\u2033 team in recent years. Former Chelsea coach Antonio Conte and Belgium manager Roberto Martinez were touted as possible replacements for Lopetegui, but talks about them faded significantly after Solari put the team back on track.\n\nMadrid routed third-division club Melilla 4-0 in Solari\u2019s debut, then defeated Valladolid to halt the team\u2019s five-match winless streak in the Spanish league.\n\nSolari left Luka Modric on the bench on Wednesday, starting with Dani Ceballos in midfield along with Kroos and Casemiro. In attack, he used Lucas Vazquez to play with Benzema and Bale. He also played with Thibaut Courtois in goal, instead of Keylor Navas, who had been starting in Champions League matches.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni", "Campaign criticized for barring journalists from ballroom\n\nHARTFORD, Conn.

To put its impact in perspective:\n\nHIV killed 448,060 Americans between 1981 and 2000.\n\nWorld War II killed 418,500 Americans.\n\nThe 1968 H3N2 flu pandemic killed 100,000 Americans.\n\nThe 2017-18 flu outbreak killed 80,000 to 90,000 Americans.\n\nA century after the outbreak, it\u2019s important to be knowledgeable about a global event that caused so much havoc. It\u2019s also important to take and use any lessons that are still applicable today.\n\nThat starts with taking the flu seriously. Even with advances in modern medicine, the world remains vulnerable \u2014 particularly in a tightly connected society in which it is much more conducive for a disease to spread.\n\nNational and international public health agencies put a lot of effort into monitoring seasonal flu outbreaks and watching for the emergence of new flu viruses that could spark a pandemic.\n\nFlu shots can help against seasonal flu outbreaks by both reducing the risk of getting infected and reducing the severity of the sickness if one does get infected.\n\nBy its definition, however, a pandemic flu involves a new strain of the virus that the population has little or no immunity against. In such a case, the flu shot won\u2019t be much help; at least not immediately.\n\nThat\u2019s when healthy habits and an understanding of how the flu spreads can help slow its momentum.\n\nPeople with the flu can spread it to others from about six feet away, which is why it is so important for those who are sick to stay home. Practicing good cough etiquette by coughing or sneezing into an elbow or a tissue also helps.

In some cases, in fact, the turnout was very good, especially compared to the June primary and previous midterm elections. In Clay County, 56.5 percent of registered voters cast ballots Tuesday. In Oktibbeha County, the turnout was 53 percent and may go as high as 55.6 percent when all the absentee and provisional votes are counted, said circuit clerk Tony Rook. In Lowndes County the turnout was 49.1 percent while 44.2 percent of registered Noxubee County voters went to the polls Tuesday after just 4 percent of voters went to polls in June.\n\nCompared to the June primaries, when turnout in the Golden Triangle ranged from that 4 percent in Noxubee County to 15 percent Oktibbeha County, the improvement in turnout was better than anyone dared to imagine.\n\nIdeally, the turnout would be close to 100 percent. Realistically, turnouts approaching 50 percent are good. ...\n\nThe stakes were high \u2014 both U.S. Senate seats were on the ballot throughout the Golden Triangle while a U.S. House seat was up for grabs in parts of the area. ...\n\nIndividually, voters may be disappointed or pleased with the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nBut collectively, Tuesday was an unqualified success. Government works best when it is supported by an active, informed public.\n\nWhat we saw Tuesday was a positive step in that direction.\n\nWe salute all of the candidates who ran for office, the county employees and volunteers who helped stage the election and, most of all, the voters, who exercised their right and duty by going to the polls.\n\nLet\u2019s hope Tuesday\u2019s turnout becomes a momentum-builder for all future elections, including the Nov. 27 runoffs.\n\nOnline: http://www.cdispatch.com/ind\n\n___\n\nNov. 7\n\nThe Greenwood Commonwealth on the academic achievement of Mississippi\u2019s students:\n\nMississippi has made progress toward catching up with the rest of the nation in the academic achievement of its students.\n\nAccording to a report released this week, Mississippi over the past 12 years has shown more improvement in math and reading scores on a respected national test than the U.S. average.\n\nState education leaders credit tougher standards, a focus on literacy in the early grades and greater professional support for teachers for the results.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news.\n\nThe bad is there is still a long way to go to completely closing the achievement gap. In fourth grade, if Mississippi can keep up its torrid pace, it will still take roughly another 15 years to match the national average. For eighth-graders, it will take 44 years in math and 120 years in reading.

Carlson had been in the Legislature since 1993 and majority leader since 2009.\n\nOpponents like Carlson said the measure was poorly worded and it was a solution in search of a problem. They also worried it could be used as a weapon for political purposes and hurt people who don\u2019t hold office. The American Civil Liberties Union also came out against it, saying it risks restricting political speech and advocacy.\n\nArik Spencer, CEO and president of the Greater North Dakota Chamber, the state\u2019s largest business organization that came out against the measure, said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there are legal challenges to some of the provisions.\n\n\u201cWe are certainly disappointed with the results,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if voters were aware of some of the language in the measure that gave us pause.\u201d\n\nIt was the language in another highly-publicized measure, one to legalize marijuana, which led voters to reject that idea. Deb Honeyman, 54, of Bismarck, said it was too vague. Norm Robinson, campaign manager for North Dakotans Against the Legalization of Recreational Marijuana, said it \u201cwas simply too wide open for North Dakota.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was no regulation, no revenue stream,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nNorth Dakota State University student Bradley Foster, 22, who supported the measure, said the state might be more willing to accept the idea in two years.\n\n\u201cMy thought is first and foremost that 2020 isn\u2019t that far away,\u201d said Foster, a member of Legalize ND. \u201cThe opposition didn\u2019t get a win.

Andy Barr fighting off a challenge to keep Kentucky\u2019s 6th Congressional District seat:\n\nCongratulations to U.S. Rep. Andy Barr who held off a strong challenge by Democrat Amy McGrath to keep Kentucky\u2019s 6th Congressional District seat.\n\nBarr, who held a rally with President Donald Trump in Richmond and unleashed a barrage of attack ads against McGrath, was soundly defeated in his hometown of Lexington while voters in Madison and more rural counties carried him to victory.\n\nBarr will represent a deeply divided district in a deeply divided country. It will be interesting to see if this close call motivates him toward the middle or reinforces his loyalty to Trump\u2019s extremism.\n\nBarr got his fourth term in Congress off to a good start Tuesday night by striking a conciliatory tone in his victory speech. He acknowledged the deep divisions in the country, reached out to McGrath supporters and vowed to \u201cdo everything in my power to find common ground with your concerns.\u201d He didn\u2019t even mention Trump, but instead extolled his staff, campaign crew and the people, industries and natural beauty of the 6th District.\n\nDespite her military credentials, McGrath \u2014 a post-9/11 fighter pilot and retired Marine lieutenant colonel \u2014 failed to make her hoped-for inroads in rural areas. Even after Barr labeled her \u201ctoo liberal for Kentucky,\u201d she stuck to her pledge to run a positive campaign without attacking her opponent.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t pretty, but Barr did what it took to win. We wish him well.\n\nOnline: https://www.kentucky.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 3\n\nThe Daily Independent of Ashland on a newsletter that contains information about rural America:\n\nA Harvard University research newsletter distributed in late October contained a ton of valuable information that is relevant to all who live in rural America.\n\nThe research summary is called \u201cWhat matters to rural Americans\u201d and is available to the public through the Harvard Kennedy School Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. In articles by Chloe Reichel, the author summarizes a survey of 1,300 rural Americans called Life in Rural America and notes that two very important issues rise to the forefront for what people care about: the economy and the opioid epidemic.\n\n\u201cAccording to survey results, 25 percent of respondents named drug addiction or abuse as the biggest problem facing their community. Economic concerns were listed as the biggest problem by 21 percent of respondents. (Poll co-director Robert J. Blendon) also noted that while opioid misuse is often thought to impact just a few rural states, the poll found that concerns about opioid use were widespread across all of rural America.\u201d\n\nHealthcare services are a very important priority to rural Americans as well. Rural Americans tend to have far less access to doctors than people in urban areas do.\n\n\u201cWhile rural populations tend to have lower diagnosis rates of early-stage cancers than their urban counterparts, they have higher rates of being diagnosed with later-stage cancers. This helps to explain why rural areas have higher cancer mortality rates than urban areas, despite lower overall cancer incidence rates.\u201d\n\nWe find this newsletter to be a very valuable resource in large part because we believe it to be accurate. The economy, opioid epidemic, and healthcare. These are the top priorities for the rural communities of the United States. It serves as a blueprint for priorities in bettering our communities.\n\nWe also found in the research a positive fact that we agree with as well \u2014 that despite the negative headlines and reports to be found about the state of rural America today, rural Americans don\u2019t see it that way. Citing the Life in Rural America survey, Reichel wrote:\n\n\u201cDespite the problems facing rural Americans, many participants were optimistic about their lives, and valued specific aspects of rural life. In terms of overall expectations, most rural Americans say their lives have turned out either better than they expected (41 percent) or about like they expected (42 percent), while only 15 percent say their lives have turned out worse than they expected.\u201d\n\nOnline: https://www.dailyindependent.com/\n\n___", "Recent editorials from Tennessee newspapers:\n\n___\n\nNov. 6\n\nThe Tennessean on the need for civility:\n\nTalking about civility is not easy and it was especially difficult during the contentious 2018 midterm elections.\n\nNegative ads ate away at the reputation of many decent candidates seeking public office.\n\nFactions preferred to listen to their own messages and drown out the voices of those who opposed or questioned them.\n\nCitizens are feeling tired, maybe wounded, and wary of politics.\n\nBut the election is now over. Despite the partisan rancor, now we need to accept the results and choose a better path to move our cities, state and nation forward.\n\nThat better path means vigorously practicing citizenship and all the responsibilities that come with it.\n\nCivility is part of that, and it is not simply manners. It is about listening, exchanging ideas and treating all members of the community with respect and dignity.\n\nIt is not fake niceness or indifference. And it is the antithesis of name calling, hate and violence.\n\nCivics is also a part of practicing citizenship and it means being informed about what happens in the community.\n\nIt is wonderful to see an uptick in voting, but while fear and anger are great motivators, a habit of informed and sustained voting is much healthier for our republic.\n\nParticipation is essential. This tells our leaders what we think, but it also tells them that we care.\n\nAt the Oct. 27 Civic Saturday event in South Nashville, artist Kate Tucker delivered a \u201ccivic sermon\u201d to the audience where she challenged people to participate and not be mere bystanders of the democratic process.\n\n\u201cWe are in a time where much is being asked of us,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cWe cannot just trust the process, we must participate in it. We must act intentionally, in spite of circumstance, as the great leaders of the Civil Rights Movement did time and time again. Their faith in the Constitution and in the American dream was undergirded by a moral fabric evidenced in the principles of nonviolence \u2014 love over hate, courage over fear, hope over despair.\u201d\n\nLove, courage and hope \u2014 and civil discourse \u2014 are key to ensuring we can heal.\n\nWe must demand that our leaders embrace this call in their actions and their words to lead us to a better path.\n\nOnline: https://www.tennessean.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 7\n\nJohnson City Press on the Rural Area Medical Clinic and the need for affordable health care:\n\nThank goodness America has folks like the volunteers who worked the Rural Area Medical Clinic at the fairground in Gray.\n\nOver three days, the RAM clinic provided 777 patients with medical, dental and vision services, amounting to an estimated $544,750 in care they otherwise could not afford.\n\nTake Brian Gibson, for example, who received dental and hearing services. He told Press Staff Writer Jessica Fuller that without RAM, he would have to go without medical care.\n\n\u201cOne trip to the dentist is $800,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cI just can\u2019t afford that.\u201d\n\nFuller also spoke with Reese Thornton, who brought along his guitar to pass the time and entertain other patients. Thornton said he receives Medicare, but he is only able to get one dental cleaning per year under the program. He also said Medicare won\u2019t cover the cost of his glasses, so he also receives vision care through RAM every year.\n\n\u201cA lot of people, you know, they\u2019re just barely making it,\u201d Thornton said.\n\nWe applaud RAM organizers, care providers and support volunteers from churches and other organizations who helped fill the gap for Gibson, Thornton and others who are barely making it.\n\nBut why do we still have that gap? Why must the world\u2019s most advanced country have such pop-up free clinics to help the uninsured and underinsured in 2018?\n\nRAM operates more than 60 mobile medical clinics across the country and the world, with the majority occurring in rural U.S. communities. Half of those clinics are in Virginia and Tennessee.\n\nAppalachia is not the inaccessible, vastly underdeveloped region it was a half century ago before the James H. Quillen College of Medicine was established. The resulting medical infrastructure, which includes Quillen\u2019s clinics in several rural outposts, met the goal of improving access to primary care and specialists in the region.\n\nMuch of that infrastructure is in danger, however, precisely because the United States cannot get a handle on the exponentially rising costs of health care and affordable access across the socioeconomic spectrum. Costs have forced dozens of rural hospitals to shut down across the nation in recent years. Tennessee has been disproportionately affected with eight closing since 2010.\n\nBallad\u2019s merger has helped Northeast Tennessee weather the storm for now. The system was even able to live up to its commitment to building a new rural hospital in Unicoi County. But all hospitals and clinics in Tennessee are at risk, and thousands of people remain without coverage.\n\nRegardless of the politics around Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act, it\u2019s clear to us the nation must do better.\n\nEveryone benefits from a healthier society in that prevention and maintenance ultimately affect such areas as workforce readiness, education and other factors in economic well-being. Access to care is an investment.\n\nWe look forward to the day pop-up charitable clinics won\u2019t be a necessity, but until then, we are thankful for RAM.\n\nOnline: https://www.johnsoncitypress.com/\n\n____\n\nNov. 7\n\nGreenville Sun says let\u2019s quit injecting politics into every sphere of our shared existence now that the election is over, and let\u2019s stop treating our neighbors as though they are nothing more than their political positions:\n\nAnother election has passed.\n\nIt is commonplace among prognosticators, campaign managers and spin doctors to say that \u201cthis\u201d election is the most important in the history of the country. It is hard to gauge such claims, given the difficulty of stepping out of the moment and judging it fairly against all the moments of our history.\n\nIt is not hard to say, though, that the country is as divided as it has been in generations. The 2016 election was a turning point, and the viciousness of our politics has only increased since then. ...\n\nSo what to do with the likely coming gridlock now that Democrats have likely taken control of the House of Representatives and Republicans have maintained control of the Senate?\n\nHere\u2019s a suggestion: Let\u2019s take a break from resting so much on the mantle of politics.\n\nThis is not to say that politics is unimportant. The business of governing a country never ceases, and some questions can only be answered via politics.\n\nBut the degree to which we all are so consumed by politics must lessen, lest we be overcome by our own political venom. The 24-hour cable news networks thrive on the division sowed by their talking heads and endless commentary \u2014 most of it playing to its target audience. Little of the content on CNN, MSNBC or Fox News seems geared toward helping people think and understand the world in which they live. It all mostly seems to be predicated on telling their audiences things they already believe.\n\nSome days it seems social media exists only to drive the wedge between Red America and Blue America even further. Hiding behind our avatars and manufactured profiles, it\u2019s easy to click \u201cshare\u201d a little too fast on information that simply isn\u2019t true. Or to hurl insults toward someone who \u2014 if he or she were to call you up on the phone or show up at your door \u2014 you\u2019d never treat so poorly. The safe barrier of our electronic devices tends to make us more outspoken than we are \u2014 or should be \u2014 in real life.\n\nOur plea: Now that this election is over, let\u2019s quit injecting politics into every sphere of our shared existence, and let\u2019s stop treating our neighbors as though they are nothing more than their political positions.\n\nIn his 2016 book \u201cThe Fractured Republic,\u201d conservative commentator Yuval Levin offers some thoughts on how we can mend. From the introduction: \u201cThe middle layers of society, where people see each other face to face, offer a middle ground between radical individualism and extreme centralization. Our political life need not consist of a recurring choice between having the federal government invade and occupy the middle layers of society or having isolated individuals break down the institutions that compose those layers. It can and should be an arena for attempting different ways of empowering those middle institutions to help our society confront its problems.\u201d\n\nThis is not to say that the differences between conservatives and progressives should be forgotten. Levin\u2019s point is that both sides can bring something of their worldviews to bear for the greater good. But that requires living with one another \u2014 and sharing in those \u201cmiddle institutions\u201d \u2014 in good faith and earnestly seeking to help one another solve common problems.\n\n\u201cAnd countless Americans of all parties and no party are practical, experienced experts in putting family, faith, and community first and helping one another in hard times,\u201d he writes later.\n\nHaving come through such a nasty election after another not-so-nice election two years ago, how do we do this?\n\nBy taking politics a little less seriously. By investing more time building real \u201ccommunity\u201d here in Greene County.\n\n... Spend time with their teammates and their parents. Encourage their coaches and resist the urge to be \u201cthat parent\u201d no one wants to be around on game day.\n\nPour yourself into your church, club or civic group. Give of your time for a cause and get to know your peers \u2014 just for the sake of getting to know them.\n\n...\n\nOr, just spend more time with family and friends.\n\nWhatever it looks like, find something that reminds you that politics is not the end-all, be-all of our existence with each other, that politics is not the only lens through which we ought to view life.\n\nElection Day has come and gone.

It seems with each passing election more and more people are opting to vote early.\n\nWhether you took advantage of the early voting period or waited until Election Day, the most important thing is that more of you voted and that is a very good thing.\n\nIt is democracy in action.\n\nWe badger you a lot about registering to vote and then voting on or before Election Day simply because we believe in our form of government and also believe that if government is going to truly be of, by and for the people, that the people must exercise the right and privilege of the vote, and let their collective voices be heard.\n\nThat is what happened in this election, a historic midterm turnout no matter how you feel about the results.\n\nNow that hotly contested races are over, everyone should want what is best for our country, our state, our county and our communities.\n\nWe should want all those who are elected to office, whether we voted for them or not, to be successful and to lead with dignity and respect for the electorate.\n\nWe encourage those elected to office to lead in those ways and represent everyone in your jurisdiction, not just your base.\n\nVoters had a lot to decide including your choice for governor, attorney general, secretary of state and other down ballot state offices, along with a state representative, county commissioner, tax assessor and several ballot questions.\n\nYou trusted the process and that is the way it should be.\n\nPerhaps your candidate or political party won in Tuesday\u2019s election. Or, perhaps they lost.\n\nEither way, we are all winners when we peaceably elect our leader and peaceably retain or transfer power.\n\nOnline: https://www.valdostadailytimes.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 6\n\nThe Savannah Morning News on recruiting 2020 candidates:\n\nFor the local political party organizations, the day after the election is typically one of rest.\n\nIf the 2018 midterms taught anything, though, it is that for voters, the 2020 races began the moment they stepped away from the ballot machine.\n\nEngagement is at an all-time high, and voters are tired of uncontested and tokenly contested seats for posts like U.S. Congress and the Georgia General Assembly. We had the good fortune here in the Savannah-area to see challengers step up to take on established candidates in four significant races: the 1st Congressional District, State Senate District 1 and two State House districts.\n\nThe local arms of the Democratic and Republican parties should consider the public reaction a call to identify, groom and market candidates for the next cycle. And do so early, not via email plea in the months ahead of the primary.\n\nOur incumbents are much too comfortable \u2014 both within their party and in general elections. Competition isn\u2019t just valuable, it\u2019s vital. Campaigning should require more than buying some yard signs and doing a few small, friendly meet and greets.\n\nSitting elected officials must face tough questions. Without opponents, they aren\u2019t even asked.\n\nConsider the following:\n\nRep. Buddy Carter, who faced challenger Lisa Ring on Tuesday, ran unopposed for U.S. Congress in 2016.\n\nState Sen. Ben Watson hadn\u2019t faced an opponent since winning a primary for his open seat in 2010. Sandra Workman ran against him in Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nSen. Lester Jackson, who won an unopposed contest Tuesday, last faced a challenger in 2010.\n\nState House Reps. Ron Stephens and Bill Hitchens, who faced challengers Alicia Scott and Adam Bridges on Tuesday, hadn\u2019t seen opposition since 2012.\n\nAs for the four state House representatives who won unopposed races Tuesday, three had not seen opponents since first winning their current seats: Jesse Petrea in 2014; Mickey Stephens in 2008 and J. Craig Gordon in 2006.\n\nCarl Gilliard, who ran unopposed in these midterms, faced the same opponents twice in 2016: Once in a special election to fill the vacancy created by the unexpected death of Bob Bryant and then again that November.\n\nThe absence of challengers is a disservice to both the voters and the candidates. Especially in these political times, when our country and state are facing polarizing issues like never before, we need discussion and debate.\n\nThe few forums and town halls held in the run-up to this election underscored that demand. Incumbents came off insulated, if not outright tone-deaf, on several points, and challengers fell prey to parroting party stances.\n\nRecruitment for 2020 will require strategy.\n\nThe four challengers enlisted by the Democrats this cycle all ran great campaign ground games. But none had previously served in elected office, which meant they lacked records to run on.\n\nWhile being politically green can be good \u2014 neophytes are untainted by the system\u2019s bureaucracy, after all \u2014 uncertainty with voters is often a shortcoming.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, some of the challengers pushed specific views that were out of line with that of the overwhelming majority of their constituents. That left voters who were unhappy with the incumbents, but not ideologically inclined, little choice but to hold their noses and vote for re-election.\n\nHopefully, the local party brass, both Democratic and Republican, will take Tuesday\u2019s lessons and apply them immediately. There are many quality leaders both inside and outside of government in our area who would make strong Georgia General Assembly and U.S. Congress candidates.\n\nIdentify them now and start building and marketing their credentials early next year. They need name recognition, well-established resumes and detailed messages that resonate with voters.\n\nLook for women, in particular. Right now, all eight members of our legislative delegation are male. That\u2019s not representative of our community.\n\nThe 2020 Georgia General Assembly elections are particularly important. Those senators and representatives will likely be charged with redrawing the state and federal districts based on 2020 Census results.\n\nGiven the partisan nature of this process \u2014 let\u2019s call it what it is: gerrymandering \u2014 the political balance of the Georgia General Assembly will play a significant role in giving one party an advantage over the other in future elections.\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s no time for party organizations to rest.

The Armistice ending World War I took effect on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month back in 1918.\n\nThe Armistice was a time to reflect on the great loss of American lives in fighting for freedom in Europe. The event also focused on peace - with the hope that there might never again be a \u201cgreat war\u201d that called on nations to sacrifice their rising generation in battle.\n\nThe U.S. World War I Commission is holding a number of events this year, celebrating the 100th year of the Armistice. ...\n\nOne of the World War I Commission\u2019s projects is Bells of Peace. Churches - and any other organization with a bell - are asked to toll their bells 21 times at 11 a.m. It\u2019s sort of a musical 21-gun salute to remember those who have fallen in battle. At the same time, each toll of the bell accompanies a prayer for peace.\n\nSeveral local churches are planning to participate, and local veteran John Lager is working with other community organizations to promote Bells of Peace. To register for the event, visit the World War I Commission\u2019s website: www.ww1cc.org/bells\n\n...\n\nThe U.S. World War One Centennial Commission was established by Congress in 2013 to provide education programs, public outreach, and commemorative events regarding the American involvement in that war.

With the new Congress deeply split along partisan lines, the outcome ensured that the states will serve as pivotal battlegrounds for social issues heading toward the next election in 2020.\n\nOne of the strongest messages emerging from the results is that voters are eager to make the political process, including voting itself, fairer and more accessible.\n\nMichigan, Missouri and Colorado approved changes in redistricting policy aimed at reducing partisan gerrymandering through the use of independent map-drawers. A similar measure in Utah was leading in partial returns.\n\nVoters in Michigan, Maryland and Nevada supported measures calling for automatic or same-day voter registration. Several states approved new oversight of politicians\u2019 ethics. And in Florida, there was decisive approval of a measure that will enable an estimated 1.4 million people with prior felony convictions to regain their voting rights.\n\n\u201cWe see strong support for these initiatives from independents, Democrats and Republicans,\u201d said Karen Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause. \u201cThe question is whether incumbent officials will wake up to understand that people really do want democracy and that power belongs to the people.\u201d\n\nIn two Republican-leaning states, Idaho and Nebraska, voters approved measures to expand Medicaid health coverage to tens of thousands of low-income residents, while a similar measure was leading in Utah. In those states, Republican-led legislatures had refused to take advantage of expanded coverage offered under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nOther notable results:\n\n\u2014 Michigan voters approved legalization of marijuana for recreational use, making it the first Midwestern state to do so. North Dakota rejected a similar measure, while Missouri voters backed legalization of medical marijuana.\n\n\u2014 A minimum wage increase was approved in two states.

The measure would have left low-income women on the state\u2019s Medicaid plan to pay out-of-pocket for abortions and would have eliminated abortion coverage for public employees such as teachers and firefighters who receive health coverage under a state plan.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more proud of our state,\u201d said Grayson Dempsey, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon. \u201cOregonians showed up for reproductive rights access and made it very clear that we will not back down.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, West Virginia voters approved a constitutional amendment allowing lawmakers to restrict or outlaw state funding for Medicaid abortions.

Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, is reversed \u2014 an outcome considered more likely since the addition of conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the high court.\n\n\u201cBoth Alabama and West Virginia have teed up state legislators to decimate abortion rights in their states and set up legal challenges that could undermine or overturn Roe on the federal level,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash of the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. \u201cAlabama in particular approved intentionally vague language in their rollback, making it easier to criminalize abortion and pregnancy and undermine women\u2019s health and rights.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest ballot-measure victories for liberal activists came in Massachusetts, where voters rejected a conservative-backed attempt to repeal a 2016 state law extending nondiscrimination protections to transgender people.\n\nSimilarly, Oregon voters rejected a measure that would have repealed the first-in-the-nation immigrant sanctuary law.

(AP) \u2014 With the midterms over, Virginia Democrats are looking to keep riding a wave of voter discontent with President Donald Trump and take control of the state legislature next year.\n\nVirginia is set to return to the national political spotlight in 2019 when all 140 state House and Senate seats will be up for grabs. It\u2019s one of only a handful of states with off-year elections, and will host some of the country\u2019s most competitive legislative contests.\n\nRepublicans currently hold razor-thin majorities in the House of Delegates and the state Senate, but have been on a losing streak since Trump took office. They\u2019ve lost a near supermajority in the state House and three U.S. House seats. Democrats want to build on that momentum and are working to recruit candidates and identify key races to target.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a roll in this state,\u201d said Democratic Senate Minority Leader Dick Saslaw.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democrats dominated a U.S. Senate race and flipped three congressional districts. The success mirrored last year\u2019s closely watched race for governor, where Democrats trounced Republicans in all three statewide races in 2017 and won more seats in the state House than virtually anyone expected.\n\nDemocrats Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria both won close congressional races Tuesday thanks to strong showings among suburban voters unhappy with Trump. Now state Democrats are eying a number of GOP-held legislative seats in those same areas as potential targets.\n\n\u201cBased on last night\u2019s results, we\u2019re feeling very good about our prospects,\u201d said Del. David Toscano, the leader of the state House Democrats.\n\nVirginia\u2019s off-year legislative elections and status as a quasi-swing state make it an attractive place for out-of-state groups to get involved, boosting attention on the races and nationalizing the debate.\n\nIn 2015, a gun-control group backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg spent millions in an unsuccessful bid to help Democrats take control of the state Senate. And Virginia was swarmed with liberal-leaning outside groups last year, looking to send a message of rebuke to the president during his first year in office.\n\nUpping the ante for next year\u2019s elections is the fact that the winners will get to draw the state\u2019s congressional and legislative boundaries for the next decade. After Republicans successfully won key state-level races around the country in 2010 to help control the redistricting process, Democrats have made it a top priority to reverse those gains ahead of the 2021 redistricting.\n\nVirginia provides national party organizations and outside groups a good venue to fine-tune messaging and methods ahead of major election cycles, said Chris Jankowski, a GOP operative who helped Republicans keep control of the state Senate in 2015.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s typically the party that got beat in the midterm that\u2019s trying new things in the run up to the next one,\u201d he said.\n\nState Republicans said they expect many tough races, but said keeping control of the General Assembly is not a lost cause. They pointed out that Spanberger and Luria won with small margins and were helped by having Sen. Tim Kaine, a popular incumbent, at the top of the ticket. Republican Senate candidate Corey Stewart, a die-hard Trump supporter and outspoken advocate of preserving Confederate imagery, had little money and performed poorly in key suburban districts.\n\nFormer GOP Del. Greg Habeeb said the Richmond and Hampton Roads suburbs, as well as the outer suburbs of Northern Virginia, are battlegrounds that Republicans can win with the right candidates, tone and message.\n\n\u201cThe suburbs are totally willing to vote for Republicans still,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Frank Wagner of Virginia Beach, where Luria beat incumbent Rep. Scott Taylor, said he\u2019s not worried about being a top target of Democrats next year.\n\nHe said his takeaway from Tuesday\u2019s election was that health care was foremost on voters\u2019 minds. Wagner noted he broke with his party earlier this year to support expanding Medicaid earlier and said he\u2019ll works to control health care costs during next year\u2019s legislative session.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m much more issue focused, I think my constituents recognize that,\u201d he said.", "Recent editorials from North Carolina newspapers:\n\n___\n\nNov. 7\n\nThe News & Observer of Raleigh on a Democrat being elected to the state Supreme Court and Republicans\u2019 strategy:\n\nAnita Earls, who was elected Tuesday to a seat on the N.C. Supreme Court, ought to be happy that legislative Republicans apparently spend so much time reading Niccolo Machiavelli\u2019s 16th century treatise on power, \u201cThe Prince.\u201d\n\nMachiavelli urged a style of cunning political manipulation that\u2019s been embraced by Senate leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore. Only that Machiavelli was shrewder.\n\nBerger and Moore can\u2019t resist rigging the rules of the game to what they think will be Republicans\u2019 advantage. But, as The Insider\u2019s Colin Campbell recently showed, sometimes they outsmart themselves. In this case, that led to Earls, a Democrat, winning election to an eight-year term over Barbara Jackson, an incumbent Republican justice who otherwise would have been the favorite to win.\n\nThe back story: Democrats held a 4-3 majority on the court and only Jackson\u2019s seat was up for re-election this year. Republican hopes of eventually regaining the majority rested on Jackson\u2019s winning re-election.\n\nLegislative Republicans hatched a scheme to tilt the election to Jackson (\u201cNever attempt to win by force what can be won by deception,\u201d Machiavelli wrote). They canceled the primaries that would have chosen a winner from each party; there would be only the November election. They expected Jackson to be the only Republican candidate, that several Democrats would divide that party\u2019s votes, and that Jackson would win.\n\nBut no Democrat emerged to challenge Earls, an impressive Yale-educated lawyer who\u2019d had success in challenge gerrymandering and other laws passed by legislative Republicans. And then Chris Anglin, a young Raleigh lawyer, changed his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican and entered the race. Republicans tried to block Anglin but were defeated in court.\n\nAnglin took Republican votes from Jackson. Earls won 49.5 percent, Jackson 34 percent and Anglin 16.4 percent.\n\nIf there\u2019s been a consistent theme during the Berger-Moore era, it\u2019s been their zeal for changing the rules so they can accumulate more power.\n\n...\n\nThen there were the two proposed constitutional amendments that would have shifted power from the governor to legislators. All 11 former governors and chief justices, from both parties, opposed those two amendments. Voters saw that for the embarrassing power grab it was and defeated both amendments handily.\n\n\u201cHe who seeks to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived,\u201d Machiavelli wrote. Someone, yes. But maybe most North Carolinians are finally seeing Berger and Moore\u2019s political manipulation for the deceit that it is.\n\n... When Republicans were in the minority, Berger was a champion of good government. Sadly, those days are long gone. Instead, Berger has spent much of the last eight years, as Machiavelli recommended, attempting to accumulate power through illegitimate means.\n\n...\n\nIt\u2019s easy to be in favor of good government when you\u2019re in the minority. It\u2019s a test of character to support good government when you have the votes to do otherwise.\n\nOnline: https://www.newsobserver.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 6\n\nThe Charlotte Observer on the balance of power following the midterm elections:\n\nAs waves go, this was closer to Wrightsville than Waikiki. But there is hope.\n\nVoters on Tuesday gave America and North Carolina hope, not for Democratic policies, but for a taste of balance, for some checks on unchecked power, for baby steps back to a day when our politics didn\u2019t seem so hopelessly out of control.\n\nBy taking away Republicans\u2019 command of the US House and breaking NC Republicans\u2019 grip on veto-proof majorities in the legislature, voters sent a message: We as a country had gone too far. So they created conditions in which no one party can steamroll everyone in its path, as Republicans have done in recent years, especially in Raleigh.\n\nTo be sure, that could be a recipe for gridlock. But it also could promote collaboration and conversation. Imbued with new relevance, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s looming veto will perhaps prompt legislative Republicans to rein themselves in - and even take Democrats\u2019 temperature on legislation before passing it.\n\nWe are too cynical (or realistic?) to believe that Tuesday\u2019s results will mend our dysfunctional state and national politics. But they could help. And they should yield better policy, including continued health care coverage for pre-existing conditions at the federal level and more responsible budgets with bigger investments in education at the state level.\n\nThe results were also encouraging in another way. Tuesday\u2019s election up and down the ballot was in large part a referendum on President Donald Trump. CNN exit polls showed that 65 percent of voters cast their congressional vote with Trump in mind. A big Republican night would have cemented the status of the last two years \u2014 that we are a divided nation. An angry nation. A nation where the majority endorses the lies and hate and poisonous politics in which the president traffics. A big Republican night would have served as affirmation that Trump was no anomaly, and that we are a nation roiled and riven and perpetually ready for the next pitched battle.\n\nInstead, voters forcefully rejected much of that. We are still a divided nation, of course, but on Tuesday a majority stood up and repudiated Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policies. Perhaps that slap from voters will persuade some Republicans to let go of their politically motivated fealty to Trump and return to the Republican party of Eisenhower or Reagan that many voters long for.\n\nTuesday\u2019s results feel big right now. But the 2020 election starts Wednesday. Elections are a running subtotal more than a final bill, and as well as Democrats performed, the results were in line with several other midterm elections of the past 60 years. Many presidents have suffered large midterm losses before winning a second term just two years later, including Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan.\n\nRepublicans will regroup, and 2020 will be the ultimate referendum on Trump. With gridlock probable in Washington over the next two years, Democrats will surely need more than the \u201cTrump is awful\u201d message that was enough this time.\n\nOnline: https://www.charlotteobserver.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 6\n\nThe Fayetteville Observer on a minor league baseball team\u2019s new name:\n\nWe\u2019re baseball fans here, serious enthusiasts for America\u2019s Pastime. Baseball, in our editorial view, is right up there with Thanksgiving and puppies in the list of the best things about life.\n\nOne of our favorite things to see in a ballgame is that rare-but-wonderful phenomenon, the inside-the-park home run. The Houston Astros hit one Sunday in Fayetteville, when about 5,000 people showed up at Festival Park for the party that officially launched the city\u2019s new minor-league baseball team, which will be known as the Fayetteville Woodpeckers.\n\nUnveiling the name was one of the things that drew a big crowd \u2014 it\u2019s been the subject of much speculation and debate for months now, and the suspense grew after the initial launch party was postponed by the untimely arrival of Hurricane Florence. There were three factions in town \u2014 the ones who liked the name \u201cWoodpeckers,\u201d the ones who liked the other finalist, the \u201cFatbacks,\u201d and the ones who hated both and wondered why the team couldn\u2019t just go on as the Astros, which has been its identity for the past two years as the team played in Buies Creek, at the Campbell University ballpark.\n\nBut the Woodpeckers it will be, and all of us will get used to the name and come to love it. And many of us will be eternally grateful that the club didn\u2019t choose \u201cFatbacks.\u201d\n\nBut about that party: the turnout sent a wonderful signal about the city\u2019s eagerness to welcome the team and support it. In fact, the support has been pretty special to see. Even as the club\u2019s downtown stadium slowly takes shape, the team has already sold 1,500 season tickets. Fifty were sold at the Sunday event alone. The private club-level seating, with 110 seats, is sold out. Club President Mark Zarthar says the six luxury boxes are also sold out, as are four field boxes. During the Festival Park party Sunday, cashiers were busy the whole time as fans lined up to buy hats, t-shirts and other team merchandise that features a good-looking red-cockaded woodpecker, the endangered bird that has sparked a successful restoration of longleaf pine forests on and around Fort Bragg.\n\nThe team will play in the Advanced Class A Carolina League and will begin play in April in the new downtown stadium...\n\nFayetteville is turning a big corner and finally catching up with many of its peer metropolitan areas around the state.

(AP) \u2014 Republican hopes of maintaining the party\u2019s supermajority in the state House of Representatives hinge on the results of six races that are still too close to call, including an agonizingly close race in western Kentucky where the candidates are separated by just one vote.\n\nRepublicans entered the 2018 election with a 62-47 majority in the 100-seat House of Representatives, with one vacancy. Republicans won 59 seats on Tuesday while Democrats won 35. A supermajority requires 60 votes, making it easier for the political party in power to pass its agenda without getting help from the other side. The House requires at least 60 votes to send proposed constitutional amendments to the voters or to raise revenue or spend money in odd-numbered years.\n\nCumulatively, fewer than 100 votes separate the candidates in the six outstanding House races. Candidates have until Tuesday at 4 p.m. to ask for a recanvass, a process through which election officials double-check vote totals to make sure there are no mistakes. Recanvasses rarely change the outcome of elections. After that, candidates could ask for a recount, but they would have to pay for it themselves.\n\nOf the six House races in dispute, Democrats are leading in four of them. If the results hold, it would give Republicans exactly 60 votes when the legislature reconvenes in January.\n\nThree incumbents were in danger of losing their seats. In Daviess County, Democrat Jim Glenn leads Republican DJ Johnson by just one vote out of the 12,637 votes cast. Glenn, a college professor, held the seat for five terms before losing to Johnson in 2016. Johnson said he plans to ask for a recanvass.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely owe it to all the voters to make sure everything is 100 percent accurate,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Hardin and Meade counties, six-term incumbent Democrat Jeff Greer was losing to Republican Nancy Tate by just six votes.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump floated the idea Wednesday of partnering with the newly Democratic-led House on two ideas that could prove popular with voters: Increasing spending on America\u2019s infrastructure and limiting drug prices.\n\nYet the poisonous atmosphere in Washington, mandated federal spending limits and a potential duel over the government\u2019s borrowing authority make it difficult to achieve any deals that would boost economic growth.\n\nOver the next two years, with Democrats controlling the House and Republicans the Senate, most economic and market analysts foresee mainly entrenched gridlock. Many think the two sides will mostly maneuver for public favor while looking toward the 2020 presidential election year.\n\nAt a news conference, Trump reiterated his desire to reach some agreement on infrastructure spending \u2014 to rebuild roadways, rail stations or airports, for example \u2014 among other priorities. But to achieve any real breakthrough, he would have to compromise with Democrats who won office largely by opposing his plans to restrict immigration, his efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, his deficit-funded tax cuts and his opposition to gun control in the aftermath of mass shootings.\n\nThat said, most economists don\u2019t think a stalemate in Congress would necessarily depress growth. The $20 trillion U.S. economy \u2014 the world\u2019s largest \u2014 relies far more on the health of the global economy and the willingness of consumers and businesses to spend rather than on any government actions.\n\nNor do market analysts think stock prices will suffer. In fact, major stock averages soared Wednesday in the wake of the elections. In part, that\u2019s because Tuesday\u2019s vote caused no major surprises, in part because the prospect of little or no major congressional initiatives means lawmakers won\u2019t stand in the way of a robust U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cWhile you might see further gridlock if the Democrats take the House, that doesn\u2019t mean it would tip the boat and slow growth,\u201d said Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist at S&P Global.\n\nEconomists at Bank of America concluded, \u201cWe expect a divided government to lead to a legislative logjam in Washington, DC in the next Congress, limiting policy actions to passing the budget with modest spending increases and raising the debt ceiling.\u201d\n\nTrump would still have discretion on some key economic issues. His trade war with China and his drive to reduce regulations are two of them. The president has managed to pursue those priorities without Congress\u2019 involvement, though his updated trade agreement with Canada and Mexico would need congressional approval.\n\nBut the new Democratic-led House could thwart Trump\u2019s plans for more tax cuts, a wall along the border with Mexico and a 5 percent budget cut to Cabinet departments. But the Democrats\u2019 own agendas would also likely meet with defeat.\n\nAt his news conference, the president suggested that he could work with Democrats on such priorities as boosting infrastructure spending and reducing the costs of prescription drugs. He also said he\u2019d consider raising other tax rates to pay for a middle-class tax cut, though he didn\u2019t offer any details.\n\nYet Trump made clear that if House Democrats pursue him with investigations involving his 2016\u2032s connection to Russia or financial ethics allegations, he would drop his willingness to seek cooperation on legislation involving the economy or other issues.\n\n\u201cThey can play that game, but we can play it better,\u201d the president said.\n\nStill, Trump could be pressured to bargain with the Democrats on two major fiscal issues with consequences for the economy, said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the consultancy RSM.\n\nThe president would need to increase the government\u2019s borrowing capacity \u2014 or it would be unable to continue issuing debt and possibly shutter. A 2011 showdown on the debt ceiling led the S&P 500 stock index to plummet and raised fears that the economy could sink into a recession.\n\n\u201cGiven the new configuration of power in Washington, the probability of a government shutdown is greater than 50 percent,\u201d Brusuelas said.\n\nSecond, Trump would need to sign a spending bill for fiscal 2020. Otherwise, previously agreed-upon spending caps would automatically reduce federal expenditures, which would likely slow the economy during a presidential election year.\n\nThe economy has enjoyed an acceleration in growth this year \u2014 to a gain estimated to be 3 percent. Unemployment is at a five-decade low of 3.7 percent, and employers are posting record-high job openings. The economy\u2019s expansion is already the second-longest on record.\n\nBut annual growth is widely expected to dip back to its long-term average near 2 percent by 2020. It\u2019s even possible the economy could slip into a recession within a few years as growth stalls \u2014 for reasons unrelated to who controls the White House or Congress. A global slowdown could, for example, spill into the United States. Or higher interest rates, spurred by the Federal Reserve, might depress economic activity.\n\nIn an appearance last month at Harvard University, Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, outlined her agenda should her party regain the chamber\u2019s majority and she the speakership. Within the first 100 days, Pelosi said, she would seek to reduce the influence of large campaign donors and groups that aren\u2019t legally required to disclose their funding sources. She would also pursue infrastructure funding and seek protections for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, among other priorities.\n\nYet the rancor between the two parties makes the likelihood of any meaningful economic measures appear dim.\n\n\u201cThe way parties are talking about it right now, I don\u2019t think anybody is dying to cooperate,\u201d said Michael Madowitz, chief economist at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.\n\nIt\u2019s possible Trump might feel pressure to produce some tangible legislative results before his quest for re-election. If so, he could backtrack and find ways to work with Democrats to boost the economy.\n\n\u201cTrump is the wild card here,\u201d said Jason Rosenstock, a financial industry lobbyist with Thorn Run Partners. \u201cHe may want to be seen as a deal-cutter going into the 2020 election.\u201d", "VALPARAISO, Ind.

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio)\n\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 Michigan is aiming to build a potentially lucrative industry from the ground up with passage of a ballot initiative to legalize recreational marijuana.\n\nIt could do more by serving as a model for the rest of the Midwest \u2014 and possibly beyond.\n\nMichigan is the first Midwestern state to legalize recreational marijuana, with voters Tuesday passing a ballot measure that will allow people 21 or older to buy and use the drug. Including Michigan, 10 states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana; North Dakota voters decided this week that recreational pot wasn\u2019t for them.\n\nAt least one other state, Missouri , passed medical marijuana initiatives, joining Michigan and about 30 others. Supporters of a Utah medical marijuana initiative that was on Tuesday\u2019s ballot had declared victory, but the race was still to close to call Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMichigan is aiming to build a potentially lucrative industry from the ground up with passage of a ballot initiative to legalize recreational marijuana. (Nov. 7)\n\n\u201cMichigan is going to be a bit of a bellwether,\u201d said Douglas Mains, a Michigan attorney with Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP who, as a former policy and legal adviser for state House Republicans, helped draft the first bills to amend Michigan\u2019s medical marijuana law passed a decade ago.\n\nMains said Michigan\u2019s progress in building its marijuana sector will be closely watched, particularly by neighbors. He cited Ohio , which allows marijuana for medical uses but rejected a 2015 legalization measure, and Illinois, where the governor-elect supports legalizing pot.\n\n\u201cThose states are going to look to Michigan, see what problems it encounters and revenue it generates,\u201d Mains said. \u201cIt would not surprise me if either or both has this on the ballot in 2020.\u201d\n\nThe Michigan law takes effect in about a month, 10 days after the election is certified. People age 21 or older will then be allowed to have, use and grow the drug, but the process of establishing regulations for its retail sale and issuing licenses will go into 2020.\n\nThe measure, which was endorsed by a national organization of black-owned businesses and a group of retired Michigan law enforcement officers, will create a state licensing system for marijuana businesses and allow cities and townships to restrict them. Supporters say it will raise roughly $130 million in additional tax revenue each year that will go toward road repairs, schools and local governments. They also say it will allow for greater regulation of pot usage and for police to focus on more pressing problems.\n\nOpponents, including many law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, chambers of commerce and religious groups, said legalizing marijuana would lead to increased use by children, drug abuse and car crashes. They also said Michigan\u2019s proposal would be too permissive by allowing people to have up to 2.5 ounces (71 grams) of the drug on them and up to 10 ounces (284 grams) at home.\n\nMains said establishing the regulatory and retail framework for recreational pot should be easier because of the work that went into sharpening the skeletal, ambiguous medical marijuana law passed in 2008. For example, a 2016 law aimed to address confusion surrounding the legality of dispensary shops that opened after initial passage. He said Michigan policymakers also worked to create a regulated system for medical marijuana \u201cthat could be pretty easily replicated for a recreational system.\u201d\n\nProponents of recreational marijuana laws find greater acceptance in states where medical use has been authorized and a market has developed, Mains said.\n\n\u201cI think it does change attitudes of the electorate,\u201d he said. \u201cEnough people had been familiar with the medical system and had seen that the sky wasn\u2019t falling.\u201d\n\nKevin Sabet, president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a group that opposed the initiatives in Michigan and North Dakota, said money is the driver of the growth.\n\n\u201cI think the marijuana industry is champing at the bit to really spread all across the country. This is about one thing and one thing only, and that\u2019s money \u2014 for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to get rich. It\u2019s just like the tobacco industry. It\u2019s like pharma. Michigan is seen as a gateway to the Midwest. They failed in Ohio, so they came to Michigan and prevailed.\u201d\n\nGretchen Whitmer , Michigan\u2019s Democratic governor-elect, said Wednesday that \u201ca lot of states have moved forward,\u201d and she\u2019s expecting to learn lessons from them.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure that our children don\u2019t have access to recreational marijuana, but I also want to make sure we collect those taxes and that they are spent as the voters intend them to be,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mike Householder contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jeff Karoub on Twitter at https://twitter.com/jeffkaroub and find more of his work at https://apnews.com/search/jeff%20karoub .

Faith in humanity should be temporarily restored.\n\nDenver Post reporter Nic Garcia documented the decades of ground work it took to get to this point in his late-September analysis: \u201cFrom \u2018Hate State\u2019 to Jared Polis: How Colorado led the way for gay, transgender candidates to run for office \u2014 and win.\u201d\n\nThe story was a remarkable retrospective on how advocates responded to the 1992 passage of Amendment 2, which was a disgusting attempt to make it illegal to protect the LGBT community from discrimination. Garcia told the story of Equality Colorado, the Gay and Lesbian Fund, and One Colorado, rising up and fighting for civil rights in Colorado. And while ultimately it was the U.S. Supreme Court that legalized same-sex marriage across the nation, the grassroots work in Colorado was instrumental in fighting against the hardest thing of all to change: the hearts and minds of the 53 percent of voters who supported Amendment 2.\n\nBut as far as this state and this nation has come, it\u2019s important that we take a moment to note the historic significance of a Polis victory because there\u2019s much left to be done on the equality front in this nation.\n\nJust before the midterm elections, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration proposed rolling back policies put in place under President Barack Obama that provided protections for transgender individuals across many aspects of government. The rules in place ensured that transgender individuals would not face discrimination in gender-related programs like those in health care, schools or other benefits. There\u2019s not a single documented case of those new rules causing anyone harm, and yet the rules have been targeted for removal.\n\nSuch political maneuvers reinforce what we already know and simultaneously fear: it is popular and easy for politicians to turn their backs on minority populations who need the protection of the law the most.\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder too of the unresolved issues in Colorado. The U.S. Supreme Court punted on the question of whether a small business owner can be compelled by anti-discrimination laws to serve all customers equally even if it violates his or her religious beliefs. That is a true point of conflict that remains unresolved for the owner and customers of Masterpiece Cake Shop in Lakewood.\n\nThe case also turned the Colorado Civil Rights Division into a political football this year. Republicans alleged the commission is biased against business owners because commissioners are holding them accountable for discrimination. We find that sentiment concerning. Despite a rocky start that was headed for political disaster, members of both parties came together to give business owners more representation on the Civil Rights Commission, without jeopardizing the mission of preventing discrimination.\n\nPolis will certainly make issues like those a priority amid his ambitious agenda to improve the state\u2019s education system, move to clean energy and ensure all Coloradans have access to affordable health care.\n\nBut Polis\u2019 victory, on its own, is a mark of how far this state and nation have come and where we are headed.\n\nEditorial: https://dpo.st/2DqcwVR\n\n___\n\nThe Pueblo Chieftain, Nov. 6, on 911 notifications to cellphones:\n\nThe days are gone when we relied mostly on tornado sirens and Emergency Broadcast System alerts to let us know of a pending disaster or other matters of police urgency. But today\u2019s advances that allow for Reverse 911 notifications to telephones work best when people also register their cellphone numbers.\n\nThe Pueblo County Sheriff\u2019s Office recently launched a public education campaign to get more cellphone users to register in the countywide Swift 911 system. The system already accounts for landline telephone phone numbers.\n\nFor cellphones, it can broadcast a blanket message that will reach all of the cellphones in a particular geographic area, but enrollment allows for more targeted messaging. Enrollment also allows for the messages to go to cellphone users who are out of town.\n\nNationally, 911 cellphone registration is about 20 percent. In Pueblo County, it is a \u201cdisappointingly low\u201d 11 percent, according to Lisa Shorter, communications manager for the sheriff\u2019s department. The benefit of the system is \u201cit allows us to communicate things like when to stay in their homes because of severe weather or a fire or maybe crime activity in the area, things like that. So it\u2019s pretty critical to what we do on a daily basis,\u201d she said.\n\nOur community can do better than 11 percent. We can do better than 20 percent. The next time you\u2019re online, take a few moments to register your cellphone number at puebloblocountyoptin.com. The ability to communicate during emergencies is critical for both the public and emergency responders.\n\nEditorial: https://bit.ly/2F8QxUN\n\n___\n\nGreeley Tribune, Nov. 3, on the University of Northern Colorado budget crisis:\n\nThe University of Northern Colorado faces a crisis.\n\nThe university must find a way to reduce its $10 million budget deficit. The deficit is considered structural, meaning it will stick around next year unless officials can find permanent cost savings.\n\nOne measure of just how serious this situation is comes in the response to it.\n\nMandatory furloughs, early retirement programs and targeted layoffs are among a list of 13 options the newly formed President\u2019s Leadership Council has put on the table for cutting.\n\nNo decisions have been made yet, and the list of possible solutions also includes the possibility of reducing employer contributions to health and retirement plans, finding cost reductions in UNC\u2019s athletic programs and permanently reducing or restricting faculty travel for conferences, among other ideas.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll give a tip of the cap to new UNC President Andy Feinstein and his leadership council for diving into the difficult work that\u2019s required to solve the budget problem.\n\nMaking these kinds of decisions is never easy. Challenges lie ahead and the path won\u2019t always be certain. Still, the deficit must be addressed, and we wish everyone in the UNC community all the best as they tackle this tough task.\n\nWe also have a bit of advice: Don\u2019t let this crisis go to waste.\n\nIt\u2019s long been said with every crisis comes an opportunity. Such is the case for UNC.\n\nThe university\u2019s leaders have the opportunity \u2014 provided by this budget crisis \u2014 to rethink how they\u2019re spending money from top to bottom and make smart decisions that will position the university to thrive in the future.\n\nOften when leaders are faced with making these kind of cuts, they face pressure to simply make equal cuts across the board. That\u2019s often the easy answer. Everyone suffers equally and the hardest decisions are deferred.\n\nWe think that would be a mistake.\n\nUNC\u2019s leaders must look holistically at the university\u2019s operations, the emerging changes in the landscape of higher education and the realities of public funding in a state with a host of budget priorities. From there, they must make smart cuts aimed at positioning UNC to thrive in the future.\n\nThis, of course, means there may be some areas where UNC needs to spend more money than it is today, and there may be other areas that should be cut altogether. The focus must be on making qualitative improvements.\n\nUNC\u2019s leaders must make these hard decisions. And members of the broader UNC community must work with the leaders in making those choices. Doing this will ensure UNC\u2019s crisis doesn\u2019t go to waste. It will ensure UNC emerges stronger than it was before.\n\nEditorial: https://bit.ly/2zEj0My", "As President Donald Trump points to CNN's Jim Acosta, a White House aide takes the microphone from him during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018, in Washington.

We picked you.\u2019 ... It was heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nFree agent quarterback Case Keenum and longtime center Matt Paradis were named offensive captains this year, and Joseph said Thomas never conveyed his disappointment over his exclusion.\n\n\u201cNo, no. And our players vote for the captains,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cThey vote for the guys they see fit, who they want to lead their football team. So, I\u2019m not sure where that came from or who discussed that with D.T. But again, I have great respect for him. The players vote for the captains. They voted for who they thought were the best guys to lead their football team.

He also said he was the only veteran receiver who was told this.\n\nThomas added, \u201cI don\u2019t understand that because I\u2019ve never cried about getting the ball. I didn\u2019t get (upset) about nothing ... it just hurt me. I\u2019m emotional. I\u2019m empty. I\u2019m empty still.\u201d\n\nThomas caught three passes for 61 yards in the Texans\u2019 win Sunday in Denver, where the Broncos honored their former receiver with a video tribute before the game and by putting a giant \u201cThank you\u201d on the 10-story-high banner of Thomas outside their stadium.\n\n\u201cWe have great respect for D.T.,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cHe was a great player here and we honored him on Sunday. We didn\u2019t win the game; he won the game. I think it\u2019s a little frustration on his part, but I\u2019m disappointed in how it came out because I don\u2019t recall it being discussed that way.

Pritzker capitalized on Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's unpopularity and disfavor with GOP President Donald Trump to be elected Illinois governor. (Zbigniew Bzdak/Chicago Tribune via AP)\n\nSPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) \u2014 Gov.-elect J.B. Pritzker\u2019s victory over incumbent Bruce Rauner was fueled by dissatisfaction with the Republican\u2019s handling of a state budget crisis and by greater trust in the Democrat to eradicate government corruption.\n\nPritzker, who used $172 million of his own money in the campaign, more than any gubernatorial candidate in U.S. history, said Wednesday that despite the labels with which his opponent tagged him, voters trust him to scrub Illinois politics of its shady reputation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to rid our state of corruption. We\u2019ve got to have transparency in government, change the campaign finance system, we\u2019ve got to get rid of the conflicts of interest that people have,\u201d Pritzker said Wednesday in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI think people just didn\u2019t trust Gov. Rauner to get things done. I think they do trust me to do that and I will.\u201d\n\nThe fiscal standoff , the longest endured by any state since at least the Great Depression, loomed large. Nearly two-thirds of voters in Illinois disapproved of Rauner\u2019s handling of it and about three-quarters of them voted for Pritzker, according to results from AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 115,000 voters and 20,000 nonvoters conducted for the AP by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nVoters\u2019 views on corruption ran counter to the story line repeated by Rauner, who cast his budget-battle nemesis, Chicago Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, and Pritzker as corrupt, machine-style politicians in an \u201cunholy union.\u201d\n\nVoteCast found that 79 percent said corruption in Illinois\u2019 government is a \u201cmajor problem.\u201d Pritzker apparently led among those who concurred with that assessment, 51 percent to 41.\n\nPritzker won 54 percent of the vote to Rauner\u2019s 39.3 percent, according to unofficial election returns. That 14.7 percentage-point margin is the largest defeat of an incumbent Illinois governor since at least 1900.\n\nThe billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune defended his campaign spending, saying \u201cIllinois is worth it and worth it, in particular, to defeat Gov. Bruce Rauner.\u201d\n\nBut he pledged a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d look at campaign finance laws to make elective office available to everyone, including consideration of public financing, an idea floated by one of his Democratic primary opponents, Sen. Daniel Biss. He did not offer further details on that or ending conflicts of interest.\n\nPritzker has promised to push for a constitutional amendment to replace the flat income-tax system with a progressive one that requires the wealthy to pay a greater share, but that\u2019s a question for voters that can\u2019t be posed until 2020. Pritzker said his first task will be to present a balanced budget plan that relies on revenue from taxing legalized recreational marijuana, and possibly on legalized sports betting and expanded casino gambling.\n\n\u201cWe want to have a budget that helps us create jobs and attract companies to the state and bringing back stability to our state will be a big progenitor of jobs and encouraging people to come,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cWhen we create jobs we bring revenue to the state without raising taxes.\u201d\n\nPritzker\u2019s triumph capped a big night for Democrats, who will take control off all six statewide offices and boast three-fifths supermajorities in both the state House and the Senate.\n\nPritzker acknowledged the difficulty in getting consensus among Democrats in Illinois, where geography and cultural differences can vary widely. However, he said, \u201cwe share common values\u201d on issues such as expanding health care and making college affordable.\n\n\u201cDemocrats don\u2019t always agree on everything, so we\u2019ll have to work hard to make sure we\u2019re getting the things done that we need for working families, but I\u2019m going to stand on principle on the things that are extraordinarily important to them,\u201d Pritzker said.\n\nHe added that he spoke Tuesday night to the House and Senate Republican leaders, Jim Durkin and Bill Brady respectively, \u201cand offered to them my interest and willingness to bring them to the table as we try to solve the challenges that we\u2019ve got across the state.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Political Writer John O\u2019Connor at https://twitter.com/apoconnor .\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "GRAND JUNCTION, Colo.

While there is plenty of noise during the campaign season, the reality is that incumbents from both parties generally are safely tucked away in districts that are gerrymandered to favor the Republican or Democrat holding the seat.\n\nThese politically \u201csafe\u201d districts carved out by the Legislature make most races foregone conclusions. That is not good for voters or democracy. A bipartisan, independent commission tasked with drawing electoral boundaries would help take the politics out of the process and make it fairer for everyone.\n\nElectoral districts for the state House and Senate and Congress are redrawn after each Census to make sure they contain roughly the same number of people. With the 2020 Census on the horizon, the Legislature should make the elimination of gerrymandering a priority in the coming session.\n\nVoters approve of the idea: Sixty-eight percent of the respondents in a Winthrop poll released in February supported the creation of an independent commission.\n\nThe power in South Carolina resides in the Legislature, and it won\u2019t be easy to persuade lawmakers to give up some of their authority. But it\u2019s clearly the right thing to do.\n\nState Sen. Sandy Senn, R-Charleston, has tried for more than a year to garner support for a bipartisan measure that would ask voters to decide via constitutional amendment if they want an independent commission. Her bill was dumped into the Judiciary Committee where it languished last session.\n\nState Rep. William Cogswell, R-Charleston, and several other lawmakers ran into the same problem with a redistricting bill on the House side.\n\nIt is notable that the redistricting effort has garnered Republican and Democratic support. South Carolina is a solidly GOP state, but Republican lawmakers such as Gary Clary, a former circuit judge from Clemson, argue that lawmakers have no business drawing their own district lines. They also do not see an independent commission as a threat to GOP control.\n\nThe zig-zagging, often illogical district boundaries benefit both Democrats and Republicans. For instance, U.S. Rep. James Clyburn is the lone Democrat among the state\u2019s seven congressmen, but his district is a contorted maze that ensures he will remain in power as long as he wants \u2014 and that whatever Democrat comes after him will as well.\n\nWith many districts \u201csafely\u201d Republican or Democratic, gerrymandering too often ensures that the winner is chosen in the primaries instead of the general election. That lack of competition is not good for the political system \u2014 or for voters.\n\nThe courts have taken an interest in redistricting controversies in other states. It would be best if South Carolinians solved this problem without court intervention.\n\nLawmakers should want fair elections from compact, contiguous districts. Voters would benefit from a less politically influenced process. An independent commission is the best option for making that happen.\n\nOnline: https://www.postandcourier.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 2\n\nThe Times and Democrat of Orangeburg on flu shots:\n\nWhile unusual health threats of all types make headlines, the public should not fail to be proactive against a common illness that contributes to the deaths of 3,000 to 50,000 individuals every year depending on the severity of the season.\n\nThe flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus. The flu can cause mild to severe illness and can be deadly \u2014 especially to vulnerable people, including the very young, the elderly and those with certain chronic health conditions. Symptoms can include a sudden onset of fever, dry cough, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, sore throat, and nasal congestion or stuffiness.\n\nWith school in session, children are in close quarters with other kids, raising the risk of contracting all sorts of illnesses, flu among them.\n\nHealth officials have long touted the importance of getting vaccinated.\n\nDr. Tracy Foo, S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control immunization medical consultant, encourages everyone six months and older to be vaccinated every flu season.\n\n\u201cGetting your flu vaccine protects not only you, but your whole family and community,\u201d she said. \u201cLast flu season was one of the worst in recent years and highlights the importance of getting your flu vaccine.\u201d\n\nEven if you were vaccinated last year, you should do so again this year because protection provided by last season\u2019s vaccine decreases over time. Also, the flu vaccine is updated each year to keep up with changing flu viruses.\n\n...\n\nFlu vaccine is available from many local providers \u2014 including doctors\u2019 offices, clinics, pharmacies, schools and workplaces. DHEC county public health departments offer flu shots. To learn more about where to get vaccinated, visit scdhec.gov/health/flu.\n\nWhile there is no guarantee of not contracting influenza even with the vaccine, the proof is in the history of results. But too many people don\u2019t take getting a flu shot seriously.\n\nFlu viruses are easily transmitted from person to person. With the increased exposure the new school year, football season and the coming holidays bring, it is important to receive a vaccination in a timely manner.\n\nFrom the date of vaccination, it takes approximately two weeks for the antibodies that provide protection to develop in the body.\n\nIn addition to getting vaccinated, South Carolina residents are encouraged to practice good health habits each day. ...\n\nWhile we count on our leaders and health experts to warn of and address the threat of the unusual, do your part against a known threat.

On balance they are a sensible reaction to changes in the banking industry since the market crash of 2008, but they should be strengthened by reform in the way banks keep their books.\n\nThe reforms, based on a law enacted by Congress in May over the strenuous objection of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will relieve all but the six largest banks of many of the onerous and costly regulatory oversight procedures mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law for all major banks. These six banks together own about half of all bank assets in the United States. They are JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.\n\nTogether with previous decisions this year by the Fed, that should make it less profitable to be a mega-bank known as a Systematically Important Financial Institution or \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d At the same time, the new reforms should improve the bottom line for smaller institutions, which will not have to maintain as large a capital buffer as the six mega-banks or face the same costly regulatory oversight. That does not completely solve the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d problem, which would require breaking up the mega-banks. But it does put the brakes on the further growth of the problem.\n\nSpecifically, the Fed has decided to reduce the capital buffer for eight banks ranging in size from $250 billion to $700 billion in assets, although these banks will still have to undergo the Fed\u2019s costly stress tests. Another 24 banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion get even looser capital and oversight requirements, except for banks with significant overseas exposure. The law passed by Congress last spring frees another six banks with assets of $50 billion or more, the original level set by Dodd-Frank, from \u201cadvanced\u201d supervision. It also reduces regulations for banks with less than $10 billion in assets.\n\nA welcome likely effect of the new regulations will be to slow the consolidation of the banking industry by improving the bottom lines of smaller institutions. Between 1984 and 2018 the number of U.S. banks covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has fallen by about 70 percent, from over 18,000 to less than 6,000, and the size of mega-banks has grown rapidly as they bought up smaller banks. That will now be less profitable.\n\nBanks make money by lending. The larger the volume of loans they can make for a given amount of capital, the more money they can make. But the higher this leverage, the more a bank risks failure when some of its loans fail to be repaid.\n\nThe new reforms effectively reduce the leverage of the mega-banks and increase the leverage of all other banks while reducing their regulatory requirements.\n\nBut along with this shift comes a higher risk of failure. One of the ways banks get in trouble is by ignoring the riskiness of their loan portfolio and failing to take steps to reduce it.\n\nUnder current accounting rules banks may book an asset, such as a loan, at its initial book value until that transaction is completed, either profitably or not.\n\nThat should change. If banks were required to \u201cmark to market\u201d all of their assets, the bad ones as well as the good ones, they would have to increase their capital reserves to cover anticipated losses. The private, nonprofit organization that oversees financial accounting standards has proposed such a reform, which would work like an automatic brake on risky lending.\n\nThe banking lobby has worked overtime to obtain relief from Dodd-Frank. It now strenuously opposes this accounting change proposed by the Financial Accounting Standard Board. The arguments put forward by the banks for retaining the old rule are self-serving and not in the public interest. Congress should not intervene to prevent the proposed rule from becoming the standard in the banking industry.\n\nOnline: https://www.postandcourier.com/", "", "DOVER, Del. (AP) \u2014 Hundreds of inmates from Delaware\u2019s maximum-security prison, the site of a deadly inmate uprising last year, will be transferred to Pennsylvania in an effort to reduce overtime for severely understaffed correctional officers, officials said Wednesday.\n\nThe head of the union representing Delaware correctional officers criticized the move, saying the department needs to commit to improving compensation and recruitment and retention of prison guards.\n\nDepartment of Correction officials said they have entered into a two-year agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections to accept up to 330 inmates from the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in Smyrna. The agreement calls for Delaware to pay Pennsylvania $123 per inmate, per day, to house offenders who were sentenced in Delaware. DOC officials said the move would result in a savings of $8 per inmate, per day.\n\n\u201cReducing mandatory overtime will provide relief for Delaware\u2019s correctional officers, and help make our facilities safer for officers and inmates,\u201d DOC Commissioner Perry Phelps said in a prepared statement.\n\nGeoff Klopp, head of the Correctional Officers Association of Delaware, characterized the move as a half-measure.\n\n\u201cThis is just another Band-Aid on the situation,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cIt\u2019s a temporary fix. Until we\u2019re able to hire and retain correctional officers, we\u2019re going to continue to have issues when it comes to safety and security in the facilities.\u201d\n\nAll of the inmates selected for transfers will have more than five years remaining on their sentences and will return to Delaware to complete their sentences when the correctional officer vacancy rate is projected to be \u201csignificantly lower.\u201d\n\nThere are currently 237 vacancies statewide, according to prison officials. They did not specify what would constitute a \u201csignificantly lower\u201d number.\n\nThe vacancy rate remains stubbornly high despite efforts taken after the February 2017 riot to boost correctional officer salaries and offer recruitment and signing bonuses. DOC officials say they have hired 130 cadets since the salary increase became effective in July.\n\nA review ordered by Democratic Gov. John Carney after the riot found that the dismissal by DOC officials of warnings about trouble brewing was indicative of an overcrowded, understaffed facility plagued by mismanagement, poor communication, a culture of negativity, and adversarial relationships among prison staff, administrators and inmates.\n\n\u201cFor years, excessive mandated overtime and fatigue ... inconsistent management ... the lack of communication, adversarial relationships, and a general lack of respect at all levels ... have contributed to poor correctional officer morale and increasing hostility between inmates and correctional officers,\u201d the review stated.\n\nCarney noted that reducing mandatory overtime was among the report\u2019s key recommendations.\n\n\u201cWe have heard loud and clear that the high levels of mandatory overtime in Delaware\u2019s prisons creates hardships for correctional officers and real security concerns inside our correctional facilities,\u201d he said in a prepared statement.\n\nWednesday\u2019s announcement comes amid the ongoing trial for three of the 18 inmates indicted on criminal charges after the riot. It also follows the filing of a class-action lawsuit last week on behalf of scores of inmates at the prison. The lawsuit alleges that they were subjected to inhumane conditions and physical and verbal abuse by guards both before and after the riot.\n\nSixteen inmates were charged with murder, kidnapping and other crimes following the riot, during which prison guard Steven Floyd was killed and three other staffers taken hostage.

Advocacy groups credit an intense effort to ensure a strong Native vote that included free qualifying IDs and free rides to the polls. (Mike McCleary/The Bismarck Tribune via AP)\n\nBISMARCK, N.D. (AP) \u2014 Only a few dozen Native American voters appear to have been affected on Election Day by changes to North Dakota\u2019s voter identification requirements that many tribal members believed were aimed at suppressing their vote.\n\nAdvocacy groups credited an intense effort to ensure a strong Indian vote on Tuesday that included everything from offering free qualifying IDs to free rides to the polls, though it wasn\u2019t enough to influence a key U.S. Senate race. Democratic incumbent Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who won her seat six years ago with the help of the Native American vote, was beaten by Republican U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer on Tuesday in her bid for re-election.\n\nThe number of tribal votes that might end up not being counted total only in the dozens across four reservations, according to estimates from the Lakota People\u2019s Law Project, the Four Directions nonprofit and the University of Colorado\u2019s American Indian Law Clinic, all of whom had people at reservation polling sites Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHard work ahead of time paid off pretty well,\u201d said Four Directions consultant Bret Healy. He added, however, that \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have to move heaven and earth just to be able to cast a ballot.\u201d\n\nA U.S. Supreme Court ruling in October allowed the state to continue requiring street addresses on voter IDs, as opposed to addresses such as post office boxes that many Native Americans have long relied on.\n\nTribes issued thousands of free qualifying IDs to tribal members in the run-up to the election. Advocacy groups organized efforts to educate voters and get them to the polls. Four Directions even came up with an alternative street address mapping system for the Standing Rock Reservation that allowed at least nine people to vote.\n\nIn Rolette County, which surrounds the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa reservation, 5,102 people voted, up 64 percent from the last midterm election. In 2014. In Sioux County, which encompasses Standing Rock, 1,464 people voted, the highest turnout in at least 20 years and more than double the 2014 turnout.\n\nVoters without proper ID could cast \u201cset-aside\u201d ballots, which are not counted until the voter proves his or her eligibility. The voter has up to six days, when election results are canvassed.\n\nTwenty-five set-aside ballots were cast in Rolette County and four in Sioux County, according to county auditors. The totals for the Fort Berthold and Spirit Lake reservations were harder to come by because they sprawl across numerous counties, but Carla Fredericks with the American Indian Law Clinic estimated it to be only in the dozens. The clinic had people on both reservations.\n\n\u201cThe get-out-the-vote efforts in a way canceled out the suppression problem,\u201d Fredericks said.\n\nThe suppression allegation surfaced because changes to North Dakota\u2019s voter ID laws came just months after Heitkamp\u2019s win in 2012 by fewer than 3,000 votes with the help of Native Americans, who make up about 5 percent of North Dakota\u2019s population. The Republican-controlled Legislature said that had nothing to do with updates aimed at guarding against voter fraud.\n\nNorth Dakota law has always required a street address identification, but before 2013 voters who didn\u2019t have one could sign an affidavit attesting to their eligibility. Some believe the removal of that option is an attempt to suppress the Native American vote.\n\n\u201cOur goal was to get as many people out to vote as possible, and we accomplished that,\u201d said William \u201cSnuffy\u201d Main, a board member for Four Directions.\n\nWhether the increase in Native voting this election is sustainable in coming years is uncertain.

(AP) \u2014 Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said Wednesday he is open to looking at ways to limit the power of incoming Democratic governor Tony Evers before he takes office in January.\n\nVos told reporters that in a lame duck legislative session later this month or next, he would consider bills that would \u201crebalance\u201d powers of the executive, without saying what limitations he\u2019d be open to considering. Vos said he wanted to discuss it with Senate Republican Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, who was meeting with GOP senators on Thursday to elect leaders.\n\nEvers narrowly defeated Republican Gov. Scott Walker on Tuesday, setting up divided government in Wisconsin for the first time since 2008. Republicans maintained control in the Assembly and Senate, creating likely gridlock with Evers.\n\nEvers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback said it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that Vos was \u201cdoubling down on division just hours after Governor-elect Evers called on Speaker Vos and Majority Leader Fitzgerald to set aside differences and work together on the pressing issues facing our state.\u201d\n\nVos made clear that Republicans would not be giving him a free pass, despite ihs victory, and will work to \u201ccontinue to deliver on our conservative promises.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he chooses to poke Republicans in the eye, he will end up getting very little of what he wants,\u201d Vos said. \u201cIf he wants to argue about Act 10 and all of the things that make people who eat granola and live in downtown Madison happy, that is his right but that is not where common ground is going to be found.\u201d\n\nEvers\u2019 victory is ushering in a realignment of political power in Wisconsin.

Democrats contend the GOP illegally consolidated power, packing their supporters together and dividing Democratic voters across districts.\n\nRepublicans forcefully deny that argument, saying the districts were drawn fairly.\n\nDemocrats filed a federal lawsuit three years ago challenging the lines as unconstitutional. After the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case earlier this year, it remains pending with a trial set for April in Madison.\n\n\u201cThe data are clear that the state is evenly divided but the Legislature has massive majorities for one party because they rigged the maps,\u201d said Sachin Chheda, director of the Fair Election Project, which organized the lawsuit. \u201cLegislative results don\u2019t match up with what is happening across the state.

And all that evidence is in play in April.\u201d\n\nIf Democrats lose in court they\u2019ll have to live with the maps for the 2020 elections. The Legislature is scheduled to re-draw the boundaries again in 2021 to reflect the 2020 census.

Bill Walker.\n\nWalker, an independent, ended his campaign days after Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott resigned over what Walker described as an inappropriate overture to a woman. Walker, who with Democratic support defeated Republican Gov. Sean Parnell in 2014, said he voted for Begich. Walker said he worried that Dunleavy would unravel some of his major policies, such as expanding Medicaid.\n\nIn a tweet, Walker congratulated Dunleavy \u201cfor earning the responsibility of becoming Alaska\u2019s next Governor.\u201d He said he and his team stood ready to guarantee a smooth transition.\n\nFor much of the campaign, there was angst among some Democrats and independents who feared Begich and Walker would split the vote and hand the race to Dunleavy.\n\nWalker\u2019s name remained on the ballot since he quit the campaign after the deadline to withdraw had passed. Results tallied so far showed Walker receiving a small percentage of votes.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans on Wednesday, rushed to claim control of the Alaska House, which would be a significant gain for the GOP. However, the House speaker, Democrat Bryce Edgmon, called the move premature, with one race for House seat tight.\n\nCrime was a major issue in the governor\u2019s race, and Dunleavy said public safety would be a top priority. He called for reduced spending and limiting the growth of government, though he was criticized for not offering many details on what he would cut.\n\nHe also said he supported a full payout of the check Alaskans receive from the state\u2019s oil-wealth fund, the Alaska Permanent Fund, and paying Alaskans the amount they missed out on when annual checks were capped. Preliminary budget estimates suggest that could cost $4.3 billion. The payout has been limited since 2016 amid a state budget deficit.\n\nBegich, a former U.S. senator, called Dunleavy\u2019s dividend proposal a ploy for votes that could threaten the long-term future of the program. But Dunleavy countered his proposal was a way to help restore Alaskans\u2019 trust in state government.\n\nOil prices, which were in freefall when Walker took office and hit as low at $26 a barrel in early 2016, have moderated, generally lingering above $70 a barrel so far this fiscal year. But paying a full dividend at current prices would leave a budget gap and could limit the state\u2019s ability to repay the billions of dollars in reserves the Legislature went through to help plug the deficit, said David Teal, a legislative fiscal analyst.\n\nDunleavy argues that Alaskans should get a say via vote before any changes to the dividend program are made.\n\nDividend checks are paid using permanent fund earnings, which lawmakers this year also began using for government expenses.\n\nBegich and Dunleavy differed on a ballot measure that failed Tuesday. Supporters said the measure would protect salmon habitat while opponents said it could hamper development. Begich supported the initiative; Dunleavy didn\u2019t.\n\nThe company behind the proposed Pebble Mine project near Alaska\u2019s major Bristol Bay salmon fishery, Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd., called Dunleavy\u2019s election a rejection of Begich, who opposed the project.\n\nThird-party independent expenditure groups helped boost Dunleavy, with two groups reporting combined contributions of $4.7 million to support his run.\n\nSheila Hill, who voted for Dunleavy at an Anchorage polling place, said she liked his \u201cconservative values and I think he\u2019ll be good for the state.\u201d\n\nAnchorage voter John Gregoire, an independent, backed Begich after Walker pulled out. He expressed concerns about Dunleavy\u2019s stance on fiscal issues.\n\nRyan Hansen, who also voted in Anchorage, said he trusts Dunleavy.

Most polls had shown Gillum ahead, though within the margin of error. And the Democratic turnout during Early Voting and Vote by Mail had surpassed that of Republicans.\n\nBut as the night wore on, the numbers fell toward U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, and even more so toward Gov. Rick Scott in his campaign for the U.S. Senate.\n\nGillum conceded just before 11 p.m. ...\n\nAnd suddenly, it felt like 2016 all over again, when, after leading in the polls, Hillary Clinton lost to Republican Donald Trump.\n\nWe knew, of course, that Gillum started out with a deficit, having won only 34 percent of the Democratic vote in the five-way August primary. DeSantis, by contrast, began with a stronger base, having secured 56 percent of the votes in his party\u2019s primary.\n\nWe were concerned that during the primary, because he largely polled in the single digits, Gillum had avoided scrutiny over the FBI investigation in Tallahassee. As you\u2019d expect, DeSantis placed the issue front-and-center during the general election, though Gillum said he\u2019s been told he\u2019s not a target of the investigation.\n\nWe also feared that race would be an issue, with Gillum being Florida\u2019s first African-American major party gubernatorial candidate. We had to question whether voters statewide \u2014 more than two-thirds of whom are older whites, many of them conservative \u2014 would be willing to elect a black man as governor.\n\nSure enough, race became an issue the day after the primary, when DeSantis warned voters not to \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by electing his opponent.

Republican insiders tell us Gillum turned off a lot of white Democrats, especially in North Florida, who thought he played the race card too often.\n\nBut those of us who believe Tallahassee needs a course correction were buoyed by the optimism we saw in Gillum\u2019s campaign. Rather than today\u2019s forced march toward privatizing education, prisons and safety net services, Gillum ran as an unapologetic progressive, ready to stand up for the environment, raise the minimum wage, legalize marijuana, repeal Stand Your Ground, ban military-style assault weapons and push health care as a basic human right.\n\nIt was risky for him to talk about raising taxes on 3 percent of corporations to better fund education. And his talk of abolishing ICE in its present form didn\u2019t sit well with those concerned about immigration and open borders.\n\nDeSantis\u2019 challenge was that he was running to continue what Gov. Scott has done, and maintaining the status quo is not as sexy a message as one of change.\n\nBut the economy is always a central issue in elections. And right now, business is good for a lot of people and they want to keep it that way.\n\nSo DeSantis went negative, labeling Gillum as a socialist for his views on universal health care and corrupt for taking Hamilton tickets from someone later identified as an FBI Agent. He also said, wrongly so, that Gillum wanted to impose a state income tax.\n\nAnd once again, fear proved a stronger motivator for voters than the message of a happy warrior.\n\nIt was an improbable night, watching a far-left Democrat and a far-right Republican \u2014 two very different candidates with vastly different philosophies on governance \u2014 go down to the wire. It shows just how purple Florida is.\n\nThe outcome represents a devastating blow to Florida\u2019s backbench Democratic party, which needed a win. It doesn\u2019t bode well for Democrats in 2020, either, when President Trump plans to run for re-election.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s impact on this race cannot be overstated. He is the reason the then-unknown DeSantis won the Republican primary and his recent rallies clearly helped boost DeSantis\u2019 showing.\n\nThere will be more to say about races and ballot questions in coming days.\n\nBut for now, it appears Florida\u2019s leadership will remain solidly in Republican hands.\n\nAnd nearly half of Floridians will continue to feel disenfranchised.\n\nOnline: https://www.sun-sentinel.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 6\n\nOrlando Sentinel on affordable housing as DeSantis\u2019 first task:\n\nGreetings, Gov.-elect DeSantis.\n\nCongratulations on your win in Tuesday\u2019s election. We\u2019re confident you\u2019ll live up to your promise to look out for all Floridians, including the good men and women who struggle every day to pay the bills and provide for their families.\n\nThey\u2019re the people who power our economy. They make the hotel beds. Prepare the restaurant food. Fix our roofs. Cut our grass. Sell theme park tickets. Drive buses. Care for our elderly.\n\nYou talked on the campaign trail about family and expanding opportunity. Helping seniors. Improving educational opportunity. Restoring the Everglades.\n\nOK, but what many families often struggle with the most is putting a roof over their heads. Florida\u2019s red-hot housing market is great news for real-estate agents and banks, but it weighs heavily on custodians, roofers and servers.\n\nThey\u2019re sometimes one paycheck away from not having enough money to pay the rent or the mortgage.\n\nThe Florida Housing Coalition calculates that one in every four Florida households \u2014 nearly 2 million of them \u2014 is \u201chousing cost-burdened,\u201d a bit of jargon that means they\u2019re paying more than 30 percent of the family\u2019s income toward housing.\n\nThe coalition estimates that 15 percent of Florida\u2019s households \u2014 nearly 900,000 \u2014 are \u201cseverely cost-burdened,\u201d more jargon that means they\u2019re paying at least half their income toward housing.\n\n...\n\nMaking things worse is the shrinking inventory of rental units made affordable through government support. The Housing Coalition reported that the state lost some 59,000 subsidized housing units \u2014 mainly apartments \u2014 between 1993 and 2016. And the cost of rent has been rising since 2010.\n\nThat\u2019s just the rental market. For many aspiring homebuyers, rising real-estate prices have shattered their dreams of homeownership.\n\nFlorida has a mechanism to help these people, but it\u2019s broken.\n\nThe William E. Sadowski Affordable Housing Trust Funds \u2014 it\u2019s a mouthful \u2014 were set up about 25 years ago to promote affordable housing in Florida. They get money from a small surcharge on real-estate deals. The fee is small, but it has added up to $6.2 billion since the trust funds were created in 1992.\n\n...\n\nSince 1992, state lawmakers have pilfered the fund of $2.2 billion, nearly all of that since 2003.\n\nFor this budget year, with the economy booming, so we\u2019re told, the Legislature and Gov. Rick Scott still grabbed $182 million from the estimated $314 million that was supposed to help people with housing.\n\nThat\u2019s cold.\n\nThe good news, Mr. DeSantis, is you\u2019ll soon be in a position to do something about it.\n\nFor starters, you can propose a budget that doesn\u2019t rob the housing funds. ...\n\nSenators and representatives from both parties claim they support affordable housing for Florida\u2019s work force. Great. Make them live up to their words.\n\nThis is an ideal opportunity to put your beliefs about economic opportunity into practice.\n\nYou can make a difference right out of the box and show you\u2019re a governor for everyone.\n\nOnline: https://www.orlandosentinel.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 7\n\nThe Florida Times-Union of Jacksonville on health-threatening rising heat:\n\nHave you ever looked at roofers working in the Florida heat and wondered how they do it?\n\nWe have, too.\n\nThat\u2019s why working in the heat is now being identified as an occupational health issue by Public Citizen, an influential national nonprofit.\n\nIn a new report on dangerous heat, Public Citizen states that heat-related injuries and illnesses are increasing in Florida \u2014 and across the nation.\n\n\u201cHeat was the leading weather killer in the U.S. over the past 30 years,\u201d according to the report, \u201cand the problem is growing worse due to climate change.\u201d\n\nThe report also notes that Florida has one of the highest rates of heat-related hospitalization in America.\n\n___\n\nOf course, outdoor workers are not the only ones who are vulnerable as our temperatures get hotter and hotter.\n\nHeat affects children more than most adults; it should already be common sense to know this, but children should not be left in locked cars on hot days.\n\nAnd seniors often have chronic health conditions that impair normal responses to heat: only last year, eight people between the ages of 70 and 99 died in a Hollywood Hills nursing home when the facility lost air conditioning during Hurricane Irma.\n\nPregnant women, too, are also at higher risk during extreme heat because they can be prone to dehydration.\n\n___\n\nBut because they are required to do strenuous physical labor under consistently hot conditions, outdoor workers deserve increased attention; the fact is they are the ones most at risk of heat-related illnesses.\n\n\u201cMany attempt to work through discomfort or illness without complaint,\u201d declares the Public Citizen report, \u201cbecause they cannot afford to lose work time or fear losing their jobs.\u201d\n\n___\n\nGiven that \u2014 as the report points out \u2014 17 of the hottest 18 years on record have occurred since 2001, the issue of working under extreme heat won\u2019t be going away.\n\n...\n\nIt\u2019s pretty damning that, as the Public Citizen report notes, less-prosperous nations in Central America have made more progress in protecting outdoor workers than the United States (one of the world\u2019s economic giants).\n\nThe trend of rising temperatures isn\u2019t going to change.\n\nBut we can and should change how we protect the workers who toil in such heat.\n\nOnline: https://www.jacksonville.com/", "PITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 A woman and her boyfriend have both pleaded guilty to charges in an attack on a Pittsburgh teacher last year.\n\nThirty-year-old Daishonta Williams and 26-year-old Vincent Beasley both entered guilty pleas to aggravated assault and conspiracy.

The report on the handling of McNair determined that he was not provided the necessary aid and that the trainers waited too long to contact emergency medical personnel.\n\nDr. Rod Walters, a former college athletic trainer and sports medicine consultant who led the investigation, said more than an hour and a half elapsed between the time McNair collapsed and the departure of the ambulance from the campus.\n\nMaryland athletic director Damon Evans acknowledged in August that the training staff failed to provide the proper treatment to McNair, a 19-year-old sophomore.

Obtaining marijuana from another state isn\u2019t an option because federal law prohibits transporting marijuana across state lines.\n\nThe state health department will set limits on how much a patient can buy each month, and how much she or he can possess. The amendment will require the state to allow a person to buy at least four ounces per month, and possess at least a 60-day supply.\n\nQualifying medical conditions in addition to PTSD include cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, migraine headaches that don\u2019t respond to other treatment, chronic and painful conditions like Parkinson\u2019s disease, ALS and Crohn\u2019s disease, debilitating psychiatric disorders, HIV, and any terminal illness.\n\nThe amendment requires at least 24 licensed dispensaries in each of Missouri\u2019s eight congressional districts.\n\nPatients or their caregivers also can grow their own marijuana in an enclosed and locked site.\n\nEdible marijuana-infused products must be sold in child-resistant containers and include instructions with dosage amounts.\n\nPeople in jail or prison will not be allowed to use medical marijuana.", "NEBRASKA CITY, Neb.

But the gain was less than half the big August surge as borrowing in the category that includes credit cards fell.\n\nConsumer borrowing rose by a seasonally adjusted $10.9 billion following a jump of $22.9 billion in August, the Federal Reserve reported Wednesday. The August gain had been the strongest increase in nine months.\n\nThe September advance was below economists\u2019 expectations for a $16.5 billion gain. The category that covers auto loans and student loans rose a solid $11.2 billion. The category for credit cards fell by $311.6 million after having risen $4.6 billion in August.\n\nConsumer borrowing is closely tracked for signs of consumers\u2019 willingness to take on more debt to finance their purchases.\n\nConsumer spending accounts for 70 percent of economic activity and has been especially important in driving growth in recent months. The economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, grew at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in the July-September quarter, helped by the biggest burst in consumer spending in nearly four years. That GDP gain followed an even faster 4.2 percent growth rate in the second quarter of this year.\n\nWith unemployment down to 3.7 percent, the lowest level in nearly five decades, and consumer confidence high, analysts believe consumer spending will continue to provide a strong underpinning for growth.\n\nThe September rise in borrowing, which was a 3.3 percent increase at an annual rate, pushed consumer credit to a fresh record of $3.95 trillion.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s consumer borrowing report does not cover home mortgages or other types of debt secured by real estate such as home equity loans.", "Roma midfielder Lorenzo Pellegrini, right, scores his side's second goal during a Group G Champions League soccer match between CSKA Moscow and Roma at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018.

At one point he dodged two CSKA defenders with excellent footwork only to send the ball straight at goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev.\n\nCSKA is third in the group with four points from four games and has won just one of its last seven games since beating Madrid. CSKA hasn\u2019t gone past the group stage since 2011-12.\n\n\u201cWe played a bit adventurously in defense at times, you could say,\u201d said CSKA coach Viktor Goncharenko, but paid tribute to his young team\u2019s courage as the underdog. CSKA suffered a blow when right-back Mario Fernandes was forced off in the 12th minute after taking a blow to the head during a tackle.\n\n\u201cAccording to the information we have it could be a concussion along with a broken cheekbone and nose, all together,\u201d Goncharenko said. If confirmed, it would be the third time the Brazilian-born Russia player has broken his nose since 2015, and last year a serious break forced him to miss the Confederations Cup.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "FILE- In this June 27, 2018, file photo House Financial Services Committee ranking member Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., asks a question during a hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington. With Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives, Waters is now expected to become chairwoman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee, the committee that oversees the nation\u2019s banking system and its regulators. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Come January, the banking industry is going to be on Rep. Maxine Waters\u2019 time.\n\nWith Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives, the California representative is expected to become chairwoman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee, which oversees the nation\u2019s banking system and its regulators.\n\nWaters is no friend to the nation\u2019s biggest banks and Wall Street, and has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump and his administration. The congresswoman from California has called for more regulation of banks, and has opposed Trump\u2019s political appointees moving to roll back regulations on banks and other financial services companies.\n\nFor example, Waters, along with several other Democrats, were \u201cno\u201d votes on a banking industry bill that rolled back several parts of the Dodd-Frank Act, the law passed under President Barack Obama that more tightly regulated banks after the financial crisis. In the Senate, the bill was supported by several Democrats and was signed into law this summer by Trump.\n\nWith a Republican-controlled Senate and Trump in the White House, it is unlikely Waters\u2019 proposed regulations on banks will make it into law. However, it\u2019s also much less likely that any substantial new deregulatory bills get through, either.\n\nWhere Waters and Democrats will likely have the most power will be in her subpoena and investigatory powers that come as head of the committee.\n\nOne particular target for Waters will likely be the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Since Republicans took over the watchdog agency last year, the CFPB has made many about-faces on rules and regulations that it wrote under the Obama.\n\nThe CFPB has not faced much congressional oversight since Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s budget director and acting director of the CFPB, took over. Trump has nominated Kathy Kraninger, who worked under Mulvaney in the Office of Management and Budget, to be the next permanent director of the Bureau. If she is confirmed, which is likely since Republicans currently have a majority in the Senate and extended their gains in Tuesday\u2019s election, any moves she and the bureau make will likely come under increased scrutiny of Waters\u2019 committee.\n\nIndeed, Waters indicated in a statement Wednesday that a priority will be \u201censuring that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can be allowed to resume its essential role of protecting consumers from harmful practices without interference from the Trump Administration.\u201d\n\nBanks and their executives also are more likely to be called to testify in front of Congress. Democrats both in the House and Senate have been increasingly vocal about bringing scandal-plagued Wells Fargo in front of Congress again to discuss some of the bank\u2019s more recent missteps.\n\nThere\u2019s also likely to be more scrutiny of Deutsche Bank, which had been the primary financier of Trump\u2019s business entities since before he became president.\n\nBanking groups have said in interviews that they are eager to work on banking issues both parties can agree on. That could include student loans and other minor tweaks to laws on the books that govern how much capital banks are required to carry.\n\nBut there are things that will be outside of the control of Waters and congressional Democrats. Most banking laws give the regulators who oversee the industry \u2014 the Federal Reserve, CFPB, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and others \u2014 wide authority to tailor regulations as needed. Nearly all of the positions at those regulators are now filled by Trump appointees.\n\nDemocrats could investigate and scrutinize any regulators\u2019 changes. To do anything more substantial, like using the Congressional Review Act as Republicans did last year, would require cooperation from the Republican-controlled Senate and Trump\u2019s signature.\n\n____\n\nKen Sweet covers banks and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Oklahoma State\u2019s Jordan Brailford has enjoyed an outstanding season, ranking among the nation\u2019s top 10 in sacks and tackles for loss this season. For the Cowboys to have any hope of upsetting No. 6 Oklahoma on Saturday, the junior defensive end needs another strong outing against elusive quarterback Kyler Murray.\n\nOklahoma State (5-4, 2-4 Big 12) leads the nation with 33 sacks. Brailford is tied for fourth with nine and ranks sixth with 15.5 tackles for loss per game.\n\nGoing against Murray, who has been sacked just nine times all season and sits sixth in the country with 2,689 passing yards, will be a major challenge for Brailford and OSU.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been an exceptional pass rusher up to this point,\u201d said Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy of Brailford. \u201cHe has a combination of speed and power and he has really good flexibility. Even in the NFL, the guys that are good pass rushers, they can carry a certain speed up field, but then they can dip and have flexibility to get down under those blocks.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been great. He\u2019s been active, he\u2019s been a good leader and makes plays. He draws quite a bit of attention, which he should.\u201d\n\nOklahoma State is coming off a 35-31 loss at Baylor last week in which the Bears erased a 31-21 Cowboy lead in the final six minutes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really little things that we have to fix,\u201d said Brailford, who was the Big 12\u2032s defensive player of the week after OSU\u2019s 44-21 win over then-No. 17 Boise State on Sept. 15 when he had two sacks and a forced fumble. \u201cWe recognize the things that we did wrong and I feel like there\u2019s no need to panic. I feel like that\u2019s the mood in the locker room, especially on the defensive side of the ball. We just notice the small mistakes that we made and that can make a big difference in a game of inches. We just have to correct them as they come.\u201d\n\nMurray\u2019s passing prowess includes 31 touchdowns against just five interceptions. He\u2019s also been an effective runner, ranking sixth in the Big 12 with 574 rushing yards, along with seven touchdowns. He took over the job from last year\u2019s Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield and Oklahoma (8-1, 5-1, No. 6 CFP) has not missed a beat, ranking second in the nation in total offense (563.2 yards per game) and third in scoring (49.1 points).\n\nGundy recognized it as a major task for his defense to try to mitigate the dual threat that Murray presents.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really good,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cWe all know that. The basis of defensive football is that everybody has a gap responsibility, everybody has a zone coverage or man coverage. The one player you have a hard time accounting for is the quarterback. When you are trying to defend a player that is that active, it\u2019s not always easy, which has been evident if you\u2019ve watched their games this year.\u201d\n\nGundy acknowledged the possibility that the Cowboys might designate a specific defensive player to keep an eye on Murray at times, so he doesn\u2019t take off on runs. But that can be somewhat of a risky strategy, potentially leaving openings elsewhere.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s not a good plan to do it, and I\u2019m not saying people haven\u2019t tried it, I haven\u2019t seen it work very good for them,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cIf you were to spy him, it would have to be someone who is very fast because he runs pretty well. There have been attempts and have been some times that it has been successful, but if you spy him, you\u2019re giving up something somewhere else.\u201d\n\nOklahoma State defensive tackle Enoch Smith confirmed that the Cowboys\u2019 practices this week were specially designed to try to combat Murray\u2019s specific skill set.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really intense,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe are moving at a fast pace because we have to get ready for their quarterback, who is extremely agile. He will run all over the place, so we\u2019ve got a lot of movement going on in practice. A lot of intensity so we can go up against their offensive line and do what we have to do.\u201d", "U.S. Sen.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 For the past few years, the smartphone industry has been searching for a breakthrough to revive a market mired in an innovation lull and a sales slump. A potential catalyst is on the horizon in the form of flexible screens that can be folded in half without breaking.\n\nSamsung and several rivals are preparing to roll out such screens to make devices more versatile for work and pleasure. The foldable screens could increase display space to the size of a mini-tablet, but fold like a wallet so they revert to the size of regular phones. But there are questions about price and durability.\n\nIf the new phones fulfill their makers\u2019 ambitions, they will become a leap ahead for an industry whose origins can be traced to the old flip phones that consumers once embraced as cool and convenient. Foldable-screen phones, though, won\u2019t need hinges because they have continuous displays that can bend.\n\nIn an indication of how difficult it is to make a flexible screen that\u2019s also durable, Samsung first announced plans to build a folding-screen phone five years ago. It wasn\u2019t until Wednesday, though, that Samsung finally provided a glimpse at what it\u2019s been working on.\n\n\u201cWe have been living in a world where the size of a screen could only be as large as the device itself,\u201d said Justin Denison, Samsung\u2019s senior vice president of mobile product marketing. \u201cWe have just entered a new dimension.\u201d\n\nExcept for a fleeting look at a device he held in a hand, Denison provided scant information about the phone. Samsung says it will be ready to hit the market at some point next year.\n\nSmartphone makers are looking for something to excite consumers as they replace phones less often because new models are pricey and aren\u2019t that much different from their predecessors beyond slightly better cameras and batteries.\n\nThat\u2019s the main reason worldwide smartphone sales have fallen from the previous year for four consecutive quarters, according to IDC. Add it all up, and smartphone sales declined by 4 percent during 12 months ending in September. Samsung, the world\u2019s leading seller of smartphones, suffered a 7 percent decline in shipments during that period, based on IDC\u2019s calculations.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear whether flexible-screen phones will have mass appeal, especially when the bendy devices are expected to cost more than $1,000. Royole Corp., a small Silicon Valley company, is hoping to sell early versions of its FlexPai foldable-screen phone for $1,300 to $1,500 once it comes to the U.S. \u2014 something that won\u2019t happen until next year, at the earliest. For now, it will be available in China starting next month, at a price equivalent to about $1,300.\n\nWhile the idea of a device being able to bend into different shapes may sound good, IDC analyst Ramon Llamas is skeptical about how practical and durable they will be. One of the biggest questions is whether the quality of the screens will degrade as they get repeatedly folded. \u201cAre people really going to want to watch a Netflix show on these devices if there is a crease down the middle of it?\u201d Llamas said.\n\nRoyole said its FlexPai can be bent more than 200,000 times without deteriorating.\n\nOther foldable-screen phones running Google\u2019s Android software are expected to be available, too. Huawei confirmed last month that it is working on a phone with a flexible screen. LG Electronics is widely expected to unveil one at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas in January. LG didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cEveryone has been thinking about the same question: \u2018What\u2019s next? Is there nothing more from a smartphone?\u2019\u201d Royole CEO Bill Liu said.", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Pentagon has quietly stopped calling the deployment of troops to the U.S.-Mexico border \u201cOperation Faithful Patriot,\u201d dropping the name even as thousands of American forces head to southern Texas, Arizona and California.\n\nAccording to U.S. officials, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis directed the department to stop using the name and simply describe the mission as military operations on the border. The change was ordered early this week, but no reason was given.\n\nLt. Col. Jamie Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, would only say that the department is no longer using the name. But other U.S. officials said Mattis didn\u2019t like the name and believed it was distracting from the troops\u2019 actual mission, which is in support of the border patrol. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations.\n\nThe name hasn\u2019t been formally changed or rescinded, but the Pentagon has stopped using it in press releases and documents.\n\nPentagon officials rolled out the name last month after President Donald Trump ordered thousands of active duty troops to the southwest border in response to a caravan of migrant families walking slowly north through Mexico toward the U.S.\n\nAs of Wednesday, more than 5,600 troops have been deployed to Texas, Arizona and California and are mainly in staging bases.

Steve Pearce, ran for New Mexico governor, a race he lost.\n\nThe victory comes as Democrats captured control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nTorres Small ran as a moderate Democrat who promised to help the district\u2019s lucrative oil and gas industry and push for immigration reform.\n\nReached by phone late Wednesday, an emotional Torres Small struggled to fight back tears and was plagued by a cough. \u201cThis is my home,\u201d Torres Small said. \u201cI am so honored to represent this district.

It\u2019s unclear if Herrell would ask for a recount.\n\nDemocrats have long targeted the heavily Hispanic congressional district that sits along the U.S.-Mexico border, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans.\n\nHerrell, a real estate businesswoman from Alamogordo, is a conservative on social issues and was endorsed by the National Rifle Association. She faced allegations early in the campaign that she failed to disclose on campaign finance reports that she had rented property to state agencies.\n\nState records showed Herrell Properties took in $440,000 since 2013 by renting property to the New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department and New Mexico Environment Department. She later amended her reports following an investigation by The Associated Press.\n\nTorres Small, a granddaughter of Mexican immigrants who grew up Mormon, rarely mentioned Trump on the campaign trail and promised to uphold the region\u2019s \u201crural values.\u201d The avid hunter ran ads showing her with her guns, and she vowed to push for immigration reform and border security.\n\nTorres Small also did not commit to voting for Nancy Pelosi for U.S. House Speaker should the Democrats gain control of the House.\n\nFederal reports showed Torres Small raised more than three times as much money from July through September as Herrell. Federal Election Commission filings released last month show Torres Small pulled in around $1.9 million, while Herrell raised $564,000.\n\nThe district\u2019s conservative-leaning independents have intricate views on water, immigration, international trade and oil production and made the race hard to predict.\n\nTorres Small joins Democrats Debra Haaland and Rep.

Asked at the start of his campaign what his post-politics life might look like, O\u2019Rourke said he could perhaps get a certificate to teach English or \u201ctry and write something.\u201d\n\nStill, his concession speech Tuesday night made him sound like a political star who is still rising.\n\nHe dropped a joyously defiant expletive on national television and promised to make \u201csure that whatever we have created ... leads to something far greater than we have today and that all of us, every single one of us, continue to believe and make possible the greatness of the United States of America.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will see you down the road,\u201d he told thousands gathered at a minor league baseball stadium, drawing thunderous cheers and cries of \u201cBeto! Beto! Beto!\u201d\n\nRepublican strategist Joe Brettell said a losing Senate race isn\u2019t typically a springboard for a presidential run, but that O\u2019Rourke would be a natural fit for a position like Democratic National Committee chairman. Such a perch would allow him to continue to interact with his considerable donor base while building his national profile.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats nationally have a huge problem: They are old, they are largely uninspiring or retreads,\u201d Brettell said. \u201cAnd they suddenly have a fresh face who has ignited passion, but also action, at a rate we haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d\n\nTexas still hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1994, the nation\u2019s longest streak of futility by a political party. But, in his victory speech in Houston, even Cruz saluted O\u2019Rourke, saying that the Democrat \u201cworked tirelessly\u201d and that millions across the state were \u201cinspired by his campaign.\u201d\n\nDespite internal polling suggesting he\u2019d win by 7-plus points, Cruz edged O\u2019Rourke by about a third of that \u2014 and only after President Donald Trump took the once unthinkable step of traveling to the country\u2019s largest conservative state and embracing a former bitter rival just two weeks before Election Day.\n\nCruz campaign manager Jeff Roe said O\u2019Rourke\u2019s calls for gun control, universal health care and impeaching Trump were too liberal for Texas, but added, \u201cI respect him and his team and what they did\u201d and \u201chonor the campaign that they ran.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke visited all 254 Texas counties, drawing larger-than-expected crowds even in fiercely conservative, rural areas that Democrats abandoned decades ago. He said he wanted to appeal to Democrats and Republicans alike, Trump supporters, first-time voters and independents \u2014 but also refused to soften deeply liberal positions on social issues.\n\nThe hard-fought Senate race helped prompt 8.3-plus million Texans to cast ballots \u2014 the state\u2019s highest ever midterm turnout \u2014 and O\u2019Rourke raised more money than any Senate candidate in history. He also provided considerable coattails around the state, helping Democrats win seats in the Texas Legislature and key judicial races.\n\n\u201cI think he lost because of political entrenchment to be honest,\u201d said supporter Esteban Escobar, who attended O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Tuesday night event. \u201cI really wish the voters of Texas would have been more open to the unifying message that he had.\u201d\n\nIn the campaign\u2019s final weeks, as questions mounted about a future presidential run, O\u2019Rourke said it was a \u201cdefinite no.\u201d But Bannon said he got close enough to Cruz that his name on a future Democratic presidential ticket could potentially put Texas in play while making \u201ca real impression on a lot of Democratic activists around the country.\u201d\n\nBannon said O\u2019Rourke will soon be urged to visit Iowa and New Hampshire, which kick off early presidential voting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be willing to bet serious money that happens,\u201d Bannon said.\n\n___\n\nEds: Associated Press writers John L. Mone in El Paso and Juan Lozano in Houston contributed to this report.", "TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Health care and President Donald Trump\u2019s performance were important factors for Michigan residents who cast midterm election ballots Tuesday, according to a wide-ranging survey of the American electorate that found widespread unease with the nation\u2019s course.\n\nAmong Michigan voters casting ballots for governor, U.S. senator and members of Congress, AP VoteCast found that 57 percent believed the country is heading in the wrong direction, while 41 percent said things are on the right track.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in Michigan, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 138,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 3,943 voters and 649 nonvoters in the state of Michigan \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR GOVERNOR\n\nDemocrat Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s victory in the race for governor was propelled by voters under age 45. While they made up only one-third of the electorate, younger voters preferred Whitmer over Republican Bill Schuette by 60 percent to 36 percent. Older voters were about evenly divided between the two candidates.\n\nAlso crucial for Whitmer were black and other nonwhite voters, who gave her 8-to-1 support while whites were split. She drew support from 6 in 10 women while battling Schuette to a draw among men.\n\nWhitmer had a modest advantage among white college graduates, while Schuette carried whites without a college degree. Other groups strongly backing Whitmer included voters earning less than $50,000 a year, self-described independents and moderates. Schuette ran strongly with white evangelicals and had a smaller majority among Catholics, while Whitmer carried those with other religious affiliations or none.\n\nWhitmer won convincingly in cities and also carried vote-rich suburbs. Voters in small towns were divided, while those in rural areas backed Schuette.\n\nTyler Bevier, 26, a Traverse City Democrat who works in a local government planning office, said Michigan sorely needs to pour money into better roads, wastewater treatment, telecommunications and other infrastructure. \u201cFix the damn roads\u201d was one of Whitmer\u2019s campaign slogans.\n\n\u201cI think Gretchen Whitmer has a more solid plan for how to fund those improvements, and she has the experience to put them into action,\u201d Bevier said.\n\nErin Miller, 49, a marketing and communications specialist who lives near Grand Rapids, said she favored Schuette\u2019s support of lower taxes and plans to make state government less wasteful.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR SENATE\n\nIn the U.S. Senate race, three-term Democrat Debbie Stabenow\u2019s overwhelming support among nonwhite voters was decisive as whites leaned toward Republican John James, who is black. Whites without a college degree favored James, while white college graduates were evenly divided.\n\nStabenow won handily among women, moderates and independents, while men showed a slight preference for James.\n\nVoters under age 45 preferred Stabenow, while those 45 and older were split.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s pragmatic and works across the aisle,\u201d said Kristin Schrader, 51, a marketing and communications officer from Superior Township in Washtenaw County.\n\nSchrader praised Stabenow, a former chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee and now its ranking minority member, for getting farm legislation enacted when Congress was gridlocked on most issues. \u201cI\u2019m just impressed with the way she gets things done.\u201d\n\nTina Newby, 43, an information technology specialist from Westland, supported James, praising his military background and success in business. Stabenow has little to show for her time in Washington, Newby said: \u201cWhat has she done for Michigan?\u201d\n\n___\n\nTOP ISSUE: HEALTH CARE\n\nHealth care was at the forefront of voters\u2019 minds, with 28 percent labeling it the top issue facing the nation.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t make job changes or move or start new businesses because they\u2019re scared of losing their health care,\u201d Schrader said. \u201cIt\u2019s this big, wet blanket that keeps America and the economy from being what it could be.\u201d\n\nAnother 20 percent of Michigan voters considered the economy and jobs the primary issue.\n\n\u201cIf we have jobs, we can have immigrants because there will be work for them to do,\u201d Newby said. \u201cIf we have jobs, there will be money for health care. If we don\u2019t have the jobs, everything sinks.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, 19 percent said immigration was most important, while smaller numbers chose gun policy and the environment.\n\n___\n\nSTATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\nMichigan voters were mostly upbeat about the U.S. economy, with 69 percent saying it\u2019s in excellent or good shape, while 30 percent described it as not-so-good or poor.\n\n\u201cMy husband has gotten pay raises, promotions, in the last couple of years,\u201d said Jackie Malega, 34, a stay-at-home mom in Westland. \u201cI don\u2019t see as many of my friends struggling as they were a few years ago. Everywhere I go, I see hiring signs.\u201d\n\nShayne Daley, 51, an executive recruiter from Detroit, said the economic expansion and job growth are holdovers from the Obama administration that probably won\u2019t last.\n\n\u201cEvery policy that Trump pushes is threatening that economic growth,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP FACTOR\n\nTrump was on most Michigan voters\u2019 minds, with 60 percent saying their feelings toward him influenced their ballot choices. Thirty-seven percent said a reason for their vote was to show opposition toward the president, while 23 percent said they wanted to send a message of support.\n\nAnother 40 percent said the president wasn\u2019t a factor.\n\nBut even some who said Trump didn\u2019t play a role in deciding for whom they\u2019d vote said he helped motivate them to participate.\n\n\u201cOverall, I would have voted for the same candidates regardless of the Trump effect,\u201d Bevier said. \u201cBut it lit the fire of desire a bit more to go out and vote.\u201d\n\nMalega said she was happy to give Trump a boost.\n\n\u201cI like that he\u2019s not a traditional politician,\u201d she said. \u201cI like that he\u2019s outspoken. I don\u2019t always agree 100 percent with what he has to say but for the most part I do.\u201d\n\nAmong Michigan voters, 56 percent disapproved of Trump\u2019s job performance while 44 percent approved.\n\n___\n\nCONTROL OF CONGRESS\n\nSixty-three percent of Michigan voters said which party will hold control of Congress was very important as they considered their vote while 24 percent said it was somewhat important.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans in Congress have abdicated their constitutional responsibility to provide checks and balances,\u201d Daley said. \u201cThey\u2019ve allowed Trump to do whatever he likes. Absolutely deplorable.\u201d\n\nMiller said her support of James wasn\u2019t based on a desire to bolster Trump\u2019s backing in the Senate. But she praised the president\u2019s handling of the economy and willingness to take on difficult issues such as trade, where previously \u201cwe\u2019ve sort of been kicking the can down the road.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSTAYING AT HOME\n\nIn Michigan, nearly seven in 10 registered voters who chose not to vote in the midterm election were younger than 45. A wide share of those who did not vote \u2014 more than eight in 10 \u2014 did not have a college degree. About as many nonvoters were Democrats as Republicans \u2014 roughly three in 10.\n\n___\n\nAP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate in all 50 states conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News. The survey of 3,943 voters and 649 nonvoters in Michigan was conducted Oct. 29 to Nov. 6, concluding as polls close on Election Day. It combines interviews in English or Spanish with a random sample of registered voters drawn from state voter files and self-identified registered voters selected from opt-in online panels. Participants in the probability-based portion of the survey were contacted by phone and mail, and had the opportunity to take the survey by phone or online. The margin of sampling error for voters is estimated to be plus or minus 2.0 percentage points. All surveys are subject to multiple sources of error, including from sampling, question wording and order, and nonresponse.

Sessions was pushed out Wednesday as Attorney General after enduring more than a year of blistering and personal attacks from President Donald Trump over his recusal from the Russia investigation. Sessions told the president in a one-page letter that he was submitting his resignation \"at your request.\" (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions was pushed out Wednesday after enduring more than a year of blistering and personal attacks from President Donald Trump, who inserted in his place a Republican Party loyalist with authority to oversee the remainder of the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nThe move has potentially ominous implications for special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe given that the new acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, until now Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, has questioned the inquiry\u2019s scope and spoke publicly before joining the Justice Department about ways an attorney general could theoretically stymie the investigation.\n\nCongressional Democrats, concerned about protecting Mueller, called on Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing the investigation in its final but potentially explosive stages.\n\nThat duty has belonged to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller and closely monitors his work.\n\nThe resignation, in a one-page letter to Trump, came one day after Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives and was the first of several expected post-midterms Cabinet and White House departures. Though Sessions was an early and prominent campaign backer of Trump, his departure letter lacked effusive praise for the president and made clear the resignation came \u201cat your request.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions was pushed out Wednesday as the country's chief law enforcement officer after enduring more than a year of blistering and personal attacks from President Donald Trump over his recusal from the Russia investigation. (Nov. 7)\n\n\u201cSince the day I was honored to be sworn in as attorney general of the United States, I came to work at the Department of Justice every day determined to do my duty and serve my country,\u201d Sessions wrote.\n\nThe departure was the culmination of a toxic relationship that frayed just weeks into Sessions\u2019 tenure, when he stepped aside from the Russia investigation because of his campaign advocacy and following the revelation that he had met twice in 2016 with the Russian ambassador to the U.S.\n\nTrump blamed the recusal for the appointment of Mueller, who took over the Russia investigation two months later and began examining whether Trump\u2019s hectoring of Sessions was part of a broader effort to obstruct the probe.\n\nThe investigation has so far produced 32 criminal charges and guilty pleas from four former Trump aides. But the work is not done and critical decisions await that could shape the remainder of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nMueller\u2019s grand jury, for instance, has heard testimony for months about Trump confidant Roger Stone and what advance knowledge he may have had about Russian hacking of Democratic emails. Mueller\u2019s team has also been pressing for an interview with Trump. And the department is expected at some point to receive a confidential report of Mueller\u2019s findings, though it\u2019s unclear how much will be public.\n\nThe following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: Your browser does not support the iframe HTML tag.

He did not mention that White House chief of staff John Kelly had called Sessions beforehand to ask for his resignation. The undated letter was then sent to the White House.\n\nThe Justice Department did not directly answer whether Whitaker would assume control of Mueller\u2019s investigation, with spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores saying he would be \u201cin charge of all matters under the purview of the Department of Justice.\u201d\n\nRosenstein remains at the department and could still be involved in oversight. He has previously said that he saw no basis for firing Mueller. Trump said Wednesday that he did not plan to stop the investigation.\n\nWithout Sessions\u2019 campaign or Russia entanglements, there\u2019s no legal reason Whitaker couldn\u2019t immediately oversee the probe. And since Sessions technically resigned instead of forcing the White House to fire him, he opened the door under federal law to allowing the president to choose his successor instead of simply elevating Rosenstein, said University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck.\n\n\u201cSessions did not do the thing he could have done to better protect Rosenstein, and through Rosenstein, the Mueller investigation,\u201d Vladeck said.\n\nThat left Whitaker in charge, at least for now, though Democrats, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, said he should recuse himself because of his comments on the probe. Rep. Jerry Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said he wants \u201canswers immediately\u201d and \u201cwe will hold people accountable.\u201d\n\nWhitaker, a former U.S. attorney from Iowa who twice ran unsuccessfully for statewide office and founded a law firm with other Republican Party activists, once opined about a scenario in which Trump could fire Sessions and then appoint an acting attorney general who could stifle the funding of Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\nIn that scenario, Mueller\u2019s budget could be reduced \u201cso low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt,\u201d Whitaker said during an interview with CNN in July 2017 before he joined the Justice Department.\n\nIn a CNN op-ed last year, Whitaker wrote, \u201cMueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s relentless attacks on Sessions came even though the Alabama Republican was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump and despite the fact his crime-fighting agenda and priorities, particularly his hawkish immigration enforcement policies, largely mirrored the president\u2019s.\n\nHe found satisfaction in being able to reverse Obama-era policies that conservatives say flouted the will of Congress, encouraging prosecutors to pursue the most serious charges they could and promoting more aggressive enforcement of federal marijuana law.\n\nHe also announced media leak crackdowns and tougher policies against opioids, and his Justice Department defended a since-abandoned administration policy that resulted in migrant parents being separated from their children at the border.\n\nBut the relationship was irreparably damaged in March 2017 when Sessions, acknowledging previously undisclosed meetings with the Russian ambassador and citing his work as a campaign aide, recused himself from the Russia investigation.\n\nTrump repeatedly lamented that he would have never selected Sessions if he had known the attorney general would recuse himself. The recusal left the investigation in the hands of Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller two months later after Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey.\n\nIn piercing attacks, Trump called Sessions weak and beleaguered, complained that he wasn\u2019t more aggressively pursuing allegations of corruption against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and called it \u201cdisgraceful\u201d that Sessions wasn\u2019t more serious in scrutinizing the origins of the Russia investigation for possible law enforcement bias \u2014 even though the attorney general did ask the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general to examine those claims.\n\nThe broadsides escalated in recent months, with Trump telling an interviewer that Sessions \u201cnever had control\u201d of the Justice Department.\n\nSessions endured most of the name-calling in silence, though he did issue two public statements defending the department, including one in which he said he would serve \u201cwith integrity and honor\u201d for as long as he was in the job.\n\nSessions, who likely suspected his ouster was imminent, was spotted by reporters giving some of his grandchildren a tour of the White House over the weekend.

State Department spokesman Robert Palladino described it as \u201cpurely a matter of scheduling\u201d but refused to elaborate. The department said the meeting would take place at an unspecified later date, \u201cwhen our respective schedules permit.\u201d North Korea\u2019s propaganda services have not mentioned the meeting.\n\nThere\u2019s been little diplomatic progress in the five months since the June summit in Singapore where the U.S. and North Korean leaders committed to \u201cdenuclearization\u201d of the divided Korean Peninsula. Signs are growing of an impasse over how to achieve that goal. News of the postponement came after North Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry criticized the U.S. on Friday for its continued support of sanctions and hinted it may resume nuclear development.\n\nDuring a press conference on Wednesday mostly focused on midterm U.S. elections, Trump contended that he had made more progress with North Korea than past administrations, and said that with sanctions still in place, he was not in a hurry to reach a deal with Pyongyang, which has halted nuclear and missile tests for the past year.\n\n\u201cI would love to take the sanctions off, but they have to be responsive too. It\u2019s a two-way street. But we\u2019re not in any rush at all. There\u2019s no rush whatsoever,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nIn Seoul, South Korean presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said his government doesn\u2019t believe U.S.-North Korea negotiations have completely broken down or \u201clost their momentum\u201d because of the postponement. Seoul\u2019s Foreign Ministry also expressed hope that the U.S. and North Korea can quickly reschedule a high-level meeting.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s presidential Blue House said the United States had informed it of the talks\u2019 postponement in advance. But the Blue House would not reveal the reason for the postponement, referring questions to the State Department.\n\nTensions between the U.S. and North Korea that spiked last year when Trump and Kim were trading insults and dire threats have ebbed this year, but the North has not taken irreversible steps to give up the nukes it spent decades making and which it views as key to its security. The two sides are deadlocked over when sanctions should be eased, with the U.S. maintaining that it should only happen after denuclearization.

(AP Photo/David Richard)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 There are times that Dolphins coach Adam Gase hears about a cool play that happened somewhere else in the NFL, or something unique that a rival might be doing, and he makes a note to himself to check it out once his day-to-day work is complete.\n\nThen there are times he flips on the TV for pure entertainment.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Gase said, \u201cwhen you watch Kansas City, you sit back and watch because it just seems like they\u2019re out there playing 7-on-7. It\u2019s impressive to watch.\u201d\n\nPatrick Mahomes and Co. has certainly captured the attention of the league.\n\nThe Chiefs lead the NFL in scoring at more than 36 points per game. They have its reigning rushing champion in Kareem Hunt, the league\u2019s fastest wide receiver in Tyreek Hill, the most versatile tight end in Travis Kelce and plenty of depth behind all of them.\n\nThen there\u2019s Mahomes, who can break Andrew Luck\u2019s single-season NFL record with his ninth straight 300-yard passing game Sunday against Arizona. The first-year starter has thrown 29 touchdown passes, two shy of Len Dawson\u2019s 54-year-old franchise record, and he leads the league in most meaningful statistical categories: yards, TD passes, touchdown-to-interception ratio.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a baller, like I\u2019ve been saying,\u201d said Dolphins wide receiver Albert Wilson, who spent last season with the Chiefs. \u201cHe thinks he can make every throw. He has a great group of guys around him to do good things with the football. I\u2019m not surprised at all.\u201d\n\nWilson has reason to watch Kansas City, considering he has so many friends still on the roster. But it still speaks volumes that in the midst of his own preparation he finds time to tune in.\n\nThen again, it\u2019s hard for his coach to complain when Gase is doing the same thing.\n\nAlex Smith also has plenty of friends on the Chiefs, including Mahomes, who stepped into his job when Kansas City traded him to the Redskins last offseason. The veteran Smith helped to mentor the Texas Tech standout when he was a wide-eyed rookie, and he takes pride in the young quarterback\u2019s success.\n\nWhen the Chiefs rallied in the fourth quarter for a Monday night win at Denver earlier in the season, and Mahomes took on a starring role in primetime, Smith was watching from his home near Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cI mean, record-setting start for them, for him, for the offense \u2014 lighting the world on fire right now,\u201d Smith said. \u201cFun to watch, obviously a ton of friends on that team, including Pat, and to see what they are doing is crazy. They are on fire right now.\u201d\n\nThat game against Denver was the most-watched Monday night game that didn\u2019t involve the Cowboys since Week 16 of the 2016 season. When the Chiefs played the Patriots on Sunday night a few weeks ago, it earned a 12.3 rating and 21.1 million viewers for NBC, an increase of 31 percent from last year.\n\nIn the Kansas City market, about half the TVs are tuned into the Chiefs whenever they are playing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun, frankly, for me and I think everybody who is a Chiefs fan to see all the interest in the Chiefs,\u201d team owner Clark Hunt said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a credit to the success we\u2019ve had. That interest is not only here locally but it\u2019s really nationally. It seems like everybody who went to Texas Tech is all of a sudden now a Chiefs fan, which is great.\n\n\u201cYou mentioned the TV ratings \u2014 the ratings were among the highest in a number of years for that Patriots game on Sunday night. Our local ratings are also higher than they\u2019ve been in many, many years,\u201d Hunt added. \u201cOur local ratings are always very good, but clearly Andy (Reid), Patrick and the offense and the victories that we\u2019re getting has taken that to a higher level.\u201d\n\nThe Chiefs will get plenty of more exposure this season, too.\n\nAfter facing the lowly Cardinals on Sunday, the Chiefs head to Mexico City to face the high-flying Los Angeles Rams on Monday night. They also have a Thursday night showdown with the surging Los Angeles Chargers and a Sunday night trip to Seattle two days before Christmas.\n\nRegardless of whether anyone tunes in, Mahomes plans to keep the party going.\n\n\u201cJust being able to learn every day from Coach Reid, be able to get out here with all these guys, we literally have fun every single day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe love coming to work and getting to just play this game that we\u2019ve loved since we were little kids and winning a lot of games.\u201d\n\nNotes: Safety Eric Berry (heel), LB Anthony Hitchens (ribs), C Mitch Morse (concussion), WR Sammy Watkins (foot) and OL Cam Erving (illness) did not practice Wednesday. ...

We were in the minority in the Republican caucus, but the middle is where things happen.\u201d\n\nGoing into the voting, Republicans were defending majorities of 121-82 in the House and 34-16 in the Senate.\n\nRepublican Sens. Tom McGarrigle, of Delaware County, and John Rafferty, of Montgomery County, were defeated, and the son and namesake of retiring Republican Sen. Stewart Greenleaf could not retain his Montgomery County seat. A former state representative, Steve Santasiero, won a Bucks County seat left vacant by the retirement of Republican Sen. Chuck McIlhinney.\n\nDemocrat Lindsey Williams is clinging to a narrow lead over Republican Jeremy Shaffer for GOP Sen. Randy Vulakovich\u2019s seat in Allegheny County, as is Republican Sen. Tommy Tomlinson, of Bucks County, over his challenger, Democratic state Rep. Tina Davis.\n\nDavis has not conceded, and she did not plan to make any public comments until Friday, when the county will produce the official count, a campaign spokesman said. Davis needs provisional, overseas and military ballots to wipe out a Tomlinson lead of 100 votes, or she will return to the House, where she also ran and was re-elected on Tuesday.\n\nStill, the Senate has had a Republican majority since 1994.\n\nHouse Democrats projected that their net gain of at least 11 seats may be the party\u2019s largest in more than 40 years, since the electoral shake-up that followed the Watergate scandal. All of the House Democrats\u2019 gains may turn out to be in southeastern Pennsylvania.\n\nAmong other victories, Democrats flipped seats held most recently by retiring longtime GOP state Reps. Bob Godshall in Montgomery County and John Taylor in Philadelphia. Losing Taylor\u2019s seat leaves Republicans with just a single state House member in the state\u2019s largest city \u2014 Rep. Martina White.\n\nHouse Republicans will enjoy majority control for a fifth consecutive two-year session. They are projecting a majority of at least 110-93 after defeating Cambria County Rep. Bryan Barbin and winning a Clinton County district held most recently by retiring Democratic Whip Mike Hanna.\n\nStill too close to call is Democratic Rep. Helen Tai\u2019s Bucks County seat. Tai has served in the Legislature only since June, after she won a special election.\n\nThere is a new vacancy in the state Senate, where Republican Sen. Guy Reschenthaler has been elected to Congress from the state\u2019s southwestern corner.\n\nRep. Vanessa Lowery Brown, D-Philadelphia, was unopposed in Tuesday\u2019s election, but it\u2019s not likely she will be sworn in. She was convicted of bribery last week and will be sentenced later this month.\n\nThe House speaker is expected to schedule special elections to replace her and state Rep. Sid Michaels Kavulich, D-Lackawanna, who died last month and won without an opponent on the ballot.", "CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.

Tom O'Halleran in Arizona's 1st Congressional District. The incumbent and Democratic O'Halleran, running against Wendy Rogers, says he's less concerned with politics than policy. The race for the 1st Congressional District hasn't gained much attention. It was drawn to be competitive but reliably has been Democrat since 2012. (Nate Pesce/O'Halleran For Congress via AP,File)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Democrats on Wednesday secured the majority of Arizona\u2019s nine-member U.S. House delegation for the first time in four years after incumbent Tom O\u2019Halleran beat Republican challenger Wendy Rogers in the race to represent the state\u2019s sprawling 1st District.\n\nDemocrats had picked up a southern Arizona congressional seat Tuesday night that had been held for four years by Republicans to set the stage for them to grab five of the nine U.S. House seats for Arizona. O\u2019Halleran\u2019s race was too close to call on election night, but new vote totals available Wednesday show he beat.\n\nThe Arizona wins helped Democrats seize control of the House on Tuesday, a victory that means divided government returns to a Washington already prone to partisan gridlock.\n\nO\u2019Halleran first won the seat in 2016 after Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick left to wage a failed bid to defeat Republican Sen. John McCain. She won the southern Arizona seat on Tuesday that incumbent Martha McSally vacated to run for U.S. Senate.\n\nRogers has run repeatedly for congressional seats but never won. She is a retired Air Force officer who was among the first female military pilots.\n\nThe 1st District covers much of northeastern Arizona, including the Navajo Nation, and sweeps south through rural eastern Arizona. It has been won by Democrats since it was re-drawn prior to the 2012 election.\n\nO\u2019Halleran said Wednesday that he thinks Rogers did was competitive against him because she\u2019s a veteran, a woman in a year where women candidates did well and because the U.S. Senate hearings on now-Supreme Court Justice Brent Kavanagh energized the GOP base.\n\nBut O\u2019Halleran said he ultimately won \u201cbecause of my record, my bipartisanship and being able to reach across the aisle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked this district very hard,\u201d O\u2019Halleran said. \u201cI know my opponent had (called me) invisible Tom, but anybody out there knows I\u2019m all over the district all the time. I\u2019m humbled but I believe the people have confidence in me.\u201d\n\nKirkpatrick beat Republican Lea Marquez Peterson in the 2nd District, which covers parts of Tucson and spreads east through the more conservative Cochise County. Democrats held the district until McSally beat Democrat Ron Barber in 2014. McSally is now running for Senate against Democrat Kyrsten Sinema in a race that was too close to call on Wednesday.\n\nRepublicans had also eyed the 9th District in metro Phoenix vacated by Sinema, but it went strongly for a Democrat. Former Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton beat Republican and former Navy physician Steve Ferrera in that race to replace Sinema, who faces McSally in a tight U.S. Senate race that may take days to call.\n\nAnother closely watched House was a rematch of an April special election held to replace a Republican who resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations. Republican Rep. Debbie Lesko won that 8th District race by 5 percentage points against Democrat Hiral Tipirneni and won again on Tuesday.\n\nFive other Arizona congressmen whose districts have heavy partisan registration advantages, two Democrats and three Republicans, easily won new terms.\n\nThe Senate election is the top race in Arizona. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey soundly beat his Democrat education professor challenger, David Garcia. A Ducey-backed ballot measure to expand the state\u2019s voucher system and a ballot measure supported by Democrats seeks to boost renewable energy use were both rejected.\n\nO\u2019Halleran said he hopes the Arizona delegation can come together to work on issues important to the state, including water, border security, military affairs and health care.\n\n\u2014 This story has been corrected to reflect the proper spelling of O\u2019Halleran in 4th paragraph.", "Swanson has wrist surgery, to be ready for spring training\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Atlanta Braves shortstop Dansby Swanson is expected to be ready for spring training following surgery on his left wrist.\n\nThe Braves said Wednesday Swanson had a procedure on Monday to remove a \u201cloose body\u201d in the wrist.\n\nThe 24-year-old Swanson hit .238 with 14 home runs and 59 RBI in 136 games last season.

By the time he got a chance to vote, all four of the scanners in the precinct were broken. (Courtesy of Brad Lander via AP)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Election experts have long warned about the nation\u2019s aging fleet of voting equipment. This week\u2019s elections underscored just how badly upgrades are needed.\n\nAcross the country, reports poured in Tuesday amid heavy voter turnout of equipment failing or malfunctioning, triggering frustration among voters and long lines at polling places.\n\nScanners used to record ballots broke down in New York City. Voting machines stalled or stopped working in Detroit. Electronic poll books used to check in voters failed in Georgia. Machines failed to read ballots in Wake County, North Carolina, as officials blamed humidity and lengthy ballots.\n\nThose problems followed a busy early voting period that revealed other concerns, including machines that altered voters\u2019 choices in Texas, North Carolina and Georgia.\n\nVoting experts had hoped the threat of foreign governments meddling in U.S. elections, raised in 2016 when Russia targeted state election systems, would prompt action to upgrade the machinery that underpins U.S. elections.\n\nBut two years before the 2020 presidential election, 41 states are still using machines that were manufactured more than a decade ago and a dozen states are using at least some electronic machines that produce no paper trail, which can be used to settle a disputed outcome. Just three states require the type of rigorous audit backed by cybersecurity experts.\n\nSome of the voting machines in use Tuesday were built before Apple released the first iPhone in 2007, while other equipment has become so obsolete that election workers have been forced to search on eBay for replacement parts.\n\nIn some cases, local election offices have no technicians who are trained to repair their machines when something goes wrong. Some even run on Windows operating systems that Microsoft no longer supports.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t run democracy on the cheap,\u201d said Jenny Flanagan, vice president for state operations with Common Cause. \u201cWe have to invest in our democracy to make our elections work.\u201d\n\nCongress sent $380 million to states earlier this year, but that was nowhere near enough to pay for the bulk of the nation\u2019s nearly 10,000 election jurisdictions to upgrade their equipment. Experts with the Brennan Center for Justice have estimated it would take $1 billion or more to make the necessary upgrades.\n\nIn Georgia, where numerous problems led to long lines and discouraged voters at polling places Tuesday, the cost to replace its all-electronic machines is estimated at $120 million. The machines have been in use since 2002 and do not produce a paper record that voters can use to verify their selections and election workers can use to audit results.\n\nThe election technology in Georgia and the other states using all-electronic machines is so unreliable and vulnerable to hacking that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has joined calls for the machines to be replaced. In August, she said she wants \u201call state and local election officials to make certain that by the 2020 presidential election, every American votes on a verifiable and auditable ballot.\u201d\n\nVoters on Election Day and during early voting in the weeks before reported sporadic problems with election equipment in numerous states, including Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia, said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which runs the nonpartisan Election Protection voter assistance hotline.\n\nDuring early voting in Texas, some voters who were casting \u201cstraight ticket\u201d ballots for candidates solely of one party found their vote in the nationally watched U.S. Senate race changed to the other party\u2019s candidate. State officials said that can occur when voters complete and submit ballots too quickly, but voting experts said it was wrong to blame voters. The real problem was poorly designed technology that is 16 years old, they said.\n\n\u201cYou design it to work regardless of how fast people push buttons,\u201d said University of Iowa computer scientist Douglas Jones, author of \u201cBroken Ballots.\u201d\n\nJones said Tuesday\u2019s problems were not unusually bad given the state of the technology used. On Election Day, 18 voting locations in Texas opened late because of machine or poll book failures, and some locations still did not have all machines working by mid-afternoon Tuesday.\n\nOfficials in 33 states have said they must replace their machines by 2020, according to a Brennan Center for Justice report earlier this year. But so far there has not been a wholesale commitment to paying for the upgrades.\n\n\u201cA big part of this is people who are responsible for making decisions on how the money is being spent think people don\u2019t care,\u201d said Lawrence Norden, a voting systems expert at the Brennan Center. \u201cWhen you have to make decisions about how to spend money and you are a state legislator, you feel more pressure to spend money on basic services.\u201d\n\nNew York Attorney General Barbara Underwood said she was determined to get something done after voters in her state were forced to drop their ballots into emergency boxes or resort to voting by affidavit because so many electronic scanners failed within hours after the polls opened.\n\nNew York\u2019s \u201carchaic elections systems aren\u2019t just inconvenient \u2014 they also undermine our democratic process,\u201d Underwood tweeted Tuesday.\n\nThe malfunctioning equipment turned a polling place in Brooklyn\u2019s Park Slope neighborhood into a \u201cmosh pit,\u201d said Brad Lander, a New York City councilman. By the time he got a chance to vote, all four of the scanners in the precinct were broken.\n\nThe clock is ticking to make upgrades, with the presidential election just two years away. Selecting and buying new voting machines can easily take a year and a half or longer, and that\u2019s assuming a state has money to spend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like going into Best Buy, and saying \u2018I want 250 of those machines,\u2019\u201d said Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos.\n\n___\n\nLiedtke reported from San Francisco.

(AP Photo/Francois Mori, Pool)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron waded into controversy Wednesday by praising a general who helped win World War I but became a top Nazi collaborator in World War II \u2014 comments that triggered outrage among French Jews.\n\nMarshal Philippe Petain\u2019s name appears alongside seven other top military chiefs to be honored this Saturday in a ceremony at the Invalides monument, site of Napoleon\u2019s tomb, to mark the centenary of the end of World War 1.\n\nTouring battlefields ahead of a formal commemoration of the Nov. 11, 1918, armistice that ended the war, Macron said Petain was worthy of the honor for his leading role in the World War I victory.\n\n\u201cMarshal Petain was also a great soldier during World War I\u201d even though he made \u201cfatal choices during the Second World War,\u201d Macron said in the northern town of Charleville-Mezieres.\n\nThe stop was part of a weeklong tour that included Verdun, which Petain defended against a German onslaught.\n\nPetain led the French army to victory in Verdun in 1916, but gained infamy and a conviction for treason for his actions as leader of Vichy France from 1940 to 1944. He is despised for his complicity in the Holocaust.\n\n\u201cI pardon nothing, but I erase nothing of our history,\u201d Macron added.\n\nThe French presidency later said that only the five top military chiefs who are interred in the Invalides will be individually honored and have their names cited in the ceremony \u2014not including Petain.\n\nMacron will not attend the military ceremony.\n\nThe 40-year-old French president, sliding in polls, is gaining a reputation for making awkward or shocking statements. In September he told a young out-of-work gardener that he need only \u201ccross the street\u201d to find a job.\n\nBut Wednesday\u2019s remarks struck a deep chord in a nation that has lived through two world wars and only in recent decades has acknowledged its collaborationist past.\n\nFormer President Jacques Chirac admitted in 1995 that Petain\u2019s Vichy government, which collaborated with the Nazis, was the French state. Chirac spoke at the Vel\u2019 d\u2019Hiv cycling stadium in Paris, known for a 1942 roundup of French Jews that saw 13,000 people deported to Nazi concentration camps, a third of them children.\n\nFrance\u2019s leading Jewish organization, known by the initials CRIF, issued a searing criticism of Macron\u2019s stance.\n\n\u201cI am shocked by this statement by Macron,\u201d CRIF president Francis Kalifat told The Associated Press. \u201cPetain was the person who allowed the deportation of 76,000 French Jews to death camps. Petain signed the (law on) the status of Jews that meant Jews were excluded from public functions, education and forced to wear the Jewish star.\u201d\n\nFrench politicians voiced outrage and a sense of weariness at Macron\u2019s repeated gaffes, with far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon capturing the sense of indignity.\n\n\u201cMacron, this time, it\u2019s too much. The History of France isn\u2019t your toy,\u201d Melenchon tweeted. \u201cThis anti-Semitic traitor cannot be amnestied by the caprice of Macron.\u201d\n\nKalifat said it was \u201can insult\u201d that a French president could honor Petain on \u201cthe same level as the other generals.\u201d But he acknowledged the marshal\u2019s pivotal role in the Great War that earned him the nickname \u201cLion of Verdun.\u201d\n\nFrench government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux insisted the issue was a \u201cfalse controversy.\u201d He quoted Gen. Charles de Gaulle, leader of the Free French forces in World War II and the nation\u2019s universal hero, as saying of Petain in 1966 that \u201cthe glory he earned in Verdun .... can be neither contested nor go unrecognized by the nation.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFull coverage of WWI commemoration events at: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

Tooth decay. Facial scratches and lesions. Weight loss and frailty. Convulsions.\n\nThese are some of the physical signs and symptoms that might indicate that a family member or friend is suffering from an addiction to methamphetamine.\n\nThese are potential warning signs that, unfortunately, all of us need to keep a closer watch for now, with the rise in meth use being cited by local law enforcement.\n\nMethamphetamine comes in many names, according to The Canyon at Peace Park, an addiction treatment center and resource. You might hear \u201cterms like Hanyak, Hironpon, Hiropon, Hot Ice, Cristy, Batu, Kaksonjae, LA Glass, LA Ice, Quartz, and Super Ice.\u201d Or perhaps Soap Dope, Lemon Drop or Christmas Tree Meth. Sweet names for an addictive drug that can do devastating damage.\n\nLancaster County\u2019s other drug-addiction crises are not going away, though. Meth is just an unwelcome new addition (or return) to the battlefront. The vital battle against heroin and other opioids continues, Stedman told LNP.\n\nOn all of these fronts, the stakes are high. Drug overdoses led to more deaths in the United States last year than any previous year, according to a Drug Enforcement Administration report that was released Friday. The report contains the newest preliminary figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It states that more than 72,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017. That\u2019s about 200 per day, across the nation, and it\u2019s more than four times the number of drug-abuse deaths that the U.S. saw in 1999 (16,849).\n\nThe Lancaster County Drug Task Force believes the increase in meth use locally could be the result of drug dealers and addicts switching gears because of the \u201ctargeted enforcement of heroin dealers and awareness of the fatality of opioid overdoses,\u201d Blest and Stauffer reported, adding that \u201cmeth use doesn\u2019t carry the immediate risk of death by overdose that opioids do, but nonetheless is a deadly threat, according to health experts.\u201d\n\nIndeed, meth is \u201chighly addictive and really hard on the body,\u201d Dr. Michael J. Reihart, emergency services medical director at Lancaster General Health, told LNP. Usage can lead to heart damage, brain damage, violent outbursts and increased risk of stroke, among other issues.\n\nAn addict\u2019s appearance can change drastically, too, as outlined above. \u201cYou\u2019ll see people have skin lesions where they scratch their faces thinking they have insects on them,\u201d Reihart told LNP, noting that meth users often look liked they \u201caged 100 years in six months.\u201d\n\nAnd meth-related fatal overdoses are becoming more prominent locally, with meth present in 15 overdoses this year.\n\nThe local increase in meth abuse has been identified. That\u2019s a necessary step in deploying, shifting or increasing resources to tackle a problem that affects so many individuals and families, either directly or tangentially.\n\nOn the law-enforcement side, we are fortunate to have local and state police and especially the Lancaster County Drug Task Force, which targets middle- and upper-level drug dealers. According to its website, it \u201cworks closely with local law enforcement as well as the Pennsylvania State Police, the Office of the Pennsylvania Attorney General\u2019s Bureau of Narcotics Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other law enforcement agencies.\u201d The task force\u2019s funding comes from voluntary per-capita contributions from municipalities, the Office of the Pennsylvania Attorney General and forfeited \u201cassets of drug dealers that the courts determine were acquired through unlawful activity.\u201d We hope solutions can be found to boost the task force\u2019s funding, if it\u2019s needed to fight the ongoing crisis.\n\nAdditionally, we are grateful for the Lancaster County Joining Forces coalition, which describes itself as \u201ca collection of organizations and individuals who want to save lives and help our neighbors who are struggling with addiction.\u201d Its website is filled with useful resources, and we recommend that you check it. Even if you don\u2019t think drug addiction is affecting someone in your life right now, there\u2019s much there to educate you on the issue.\n\nSo, use of methamphetamine is on the rise here but, as we\u2019ve noted, it\u2019s hardly the only front in the ongoing struggle taking place in Lancaster County\u2019s homes, streets, hospitals, recovery centers and elsewhere.\n\nOne of our readers wisely noted the following with a comment on last week\u2019s LNP article: \u201cIt\u2019s important that we start referring to \u2018the addiction epidemic\u2019 as opposed to labeling the epidemic as characterized by individual drugs of abuse as they come and go (and overlap). LNP, our country and county has a problem with addiction.\u201d\n\nWe agree. The addiction epidemic is multifaceted and ongoing. Meth is just one more daunting facet.\n\n__LNP\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2SRVwfv\n\n___\n\nSEEK COMMON GROUND, NOT DIVISION, Nov. 7\n\nWe know what we Americans, together, are capable of.\n\nWe see the unity, selflessness and compassion after every natural disaster \u2014 volunteers texting donations to displaced strangers; laborers jumping in trucks to ferry supplies to those in need, regardless of tribe.\n\nWe\u2019ve witnessed it in historic sacrifices made when our nation or trusted allies have come under attack. The greatness also flows in response to deplorable acts of violence and hate \u2014 most recently the massacre of Jewish worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Eleven people were fatally shot and six others, including four police officers, were injured by a man authorities said wanted \u201call Jews to die.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh, a tough, tolerant, storied American city, rallied with interfaith remembrances. Muslims and Christians prayed, consoled and launched fundraising efforts that garnered hundreds of thousands of dollars for those affected. City and state leaders, legendary sports franchises, media outlets and other community pillars presented a unified front.\n\nThere were tears and sadness, but also deadly serious, uncompromising expressions of the core values that make our great American experiment possible. That is, the right to be free to be who we are, in thought, word and deed, because regardless of our many and deep differences, we share something essential \u2014 humanity.\n\nAs Rabbi Mark Asher Goodman of Erie\u2019s Brith Sholom said in preparation for an interfaith observance here on Friday, \u201can attack on one American is an attack on all of us. That\u2019s the best our country is.\u201d\n\nWe must find a way to abide in that mindset without being forced there by tragedy.\n\nThe poisonous spirit animating our politics degrades and dishonors the ties that bind this wildly diverse union \u2014 bonds we forged through great insight, will and also, bloodshed.\n\nPolitical strategies that fan hate, division and fear have been deployed to great effect. We have seen it on the national stage and filtered down into local hearts and minds, exemplified in fevered letters to the editor that depict political opponents as murderers or traitors.\n\nAs we move forward from these midterms, we urge greater care, civility and respect from citizens and leaders alike. Seek out differing viewpoints from outlets across the spectrum. If you hear something that seems tailor-made to inspire outrage, chances are it was. Fact-check it.\n\nAppeals for unity sometimes come off as namby-pamby. Political differences \u2014 at their core struggles over power and principle \u2014 sometimes require real struggle. But embracing dehumanization, not persuasion or compromise, as a path to triumph carries too high a price. It sullies our national character, corrodes relationships and, at its worst, legitimates violence against neighbors we are called on, as one sign displayed in Pittsburgh reminded us, to love without exception.\n\n__Erie Times\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2RFJ2Gn\n\n___\n\nPA TURNS BLUE: BIG WINS IN THE KEYSTONE STATE HELP THE DEMOCRATS, Nov. 7\n\nPennsylvania has done its part to help Democrats retake control of the U.S. House, with vote counts here likely reflecting a confluence of factors: dissatisfaction with President Donald Trump, good campaigns by female candidates and a shifting of congressional district boundaries ordered by the state Supreme Court.\n\nDemocrats ended Tuesday\u2019s election with a net gain of three seats in the 18-member congressional delegation \u2014 thanks to a series of victories by female candidates in the Philadelphia area. Democrats also held on to the 17th District seat that takes in parts of Allegheny, Beaver and Butler counties.\n\nIn that race, the only one in the nation between incumbents, Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, defeated Keith Rothfus, R-Sewickley. Mr. Rothfus is serving his third term in the 12th District, while Mr. Lamb in the spring won a special election in the 18th District, capturing a seat previously held by Republican Tim Murphy.\n\nIt all means the Pennsylvania congressional delegation to be seated next year will comprise nine Republicans and nine Democrats, compared to the 13 Republicans and five Democrats elected two years ago.\n\nWas there a blue wave in Pennsylvania? There is dissatisfaction with Mr. Trump in some districts, to be sure, but other factors also must be taken into consideration.\n\nThe state Supreme Court set the stage for more Democrats in the congressional delegation when it threw out the old map drawn by the Legislature, arguing it was gerrymandered to favor Republicans, and drew new boundaries.\n\nThree of the Democratic women who won their races \u2014 Mary Gay Scanlon in the 5th District, Chrissy Houlahan in the 6th District and Susan Wild in the 7th District \u2014 ran in districts better favoring Democrats under the new map. Another important consideration: None of the three had to run against an incumbent bringing a war chest, political network, name recognition and other advantages to the race.\n\nWhile Pennsylvania contributed to the Democratic surge in U.S. House races, the results can\u2019t simply be explained with the words \u201cblue wave.\u201d It\u2019s important to remember the old adage that all politics is local, meaning races are heavily influenced by local issues and the dynamics of individual campaigns. With the new congressional map firmly in place, the 2020 election will bring a clearer picture of the state\u2019s political leanings.\n\n__Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2PQzDyI\n\n___\n\nANOTHER BLACK EYE FOR THE SHERIFF\u2019S DEPARTMENT, Nov. 6\n\nAnd another Westmoreland County sheriff\u2019s deputy has been charged with a crime.\n\nThis time it\u2019s not a summary after a shoving match.\n\nIt\u2019s not harassment or failing to obey a traffic control device.\n\nIt\u2019s not campaign issues.\n\nNo, this time state police have charged Bobby Neiderhiser, who resigned Friday, in texting with a teenage girl, offering her and another minor alcohol in exchange for sex acts.\n\nAt what point does the county demand more of this department?\n\nNeiderhiser is now the fourth member or former member charged with a crime just this year, and the allegations are escalating in seriousness.\n\nWhat started with the Pennsylvania attorney general\u2019s office charging Sheriff Jonathan Held with using his employees to work on his campaign while on the county clock has devolved into his second in command being charged with harassment after an altercation with a union representative.\n\nPatricia Fritz has since been fired as chief deputy.\n\nThen the third highest officer, Captain Travis Day, has been charged repeatedly. There was the incident in February where he was charged with driving in a posted, restricted area behind a state police barracks. Then there were the harassment charges pressed, and then dropped and replaced with stalking charges stemming from a summer training program at Penn State required for the job.\n\nDay remains on unpaid leave.\n\nAnd that doesn\u2019t count the multiple discrimination lawsuits the county has settled and legal fees paid for those cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars racked up for a department that Held claims can\u2019t hire enough people to fill its positions .\n\nThe Westmoreland County Sheriff\u2019s Department has a disease that is rapidly proving not just serious but spreading, and that is dangerous.\n\nThere is the intrinsic danger of someone in a position of authority, someone with a gun and a badge, potentially exerting authority over someone more vulnerable.\n\n\u201cIf found guilty, the charge (against Neiderhiser) is certainly very disturbing,\u201d Held said. \u201cAs sworn law enforcement officers we\u2019re here to serve and protect, not commit crimes and victimize people.\u201d\n\nAnd that is the more intrinsic danger.\n\nWhat do we do when we can\u2019t trust the sheriff\u2019s department?\n\nWhat do we do when the people who are supposed to be the authority you turn to in a time of crisis have been accused of not playing by the rules?\n\nWhat do we do when the people empowered to stand between you and crime are being found guilty?\n\nWhat do we do about it when they won\u2019t do anything about it themselves?\n\nHeld is awaiting trial in his case and maintains his innocence. He has declined to resign his position.\n\nBut in 2013, during his first term as sheriff, when a deputy was arrested on drug charges, Held called the incident \u201ca black eye on the office.\u201d\n\nThe office\u2019s eyes are now swollen shut. Something has to be done.\n\n__Tribune-Review\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2PJc1vO\n\n___\n\nHAVING FAILED THEIR DUTY, CATHOLIC BISHOPS SHOULD TURN OVER SECRET ARCHIVES, Nov. 7\n\nIn a far-reaching special report on Sunday, journalists from the Philadelphia Inquirer and Boston Globe found that the leaders of the U.S. Catholic Church are far better at covering up child sexual abuse than stopping it.\n\nFor almost two decades, both cities have been epicenters of investigations into a sickening litany of abuse that has mushroomed across the country. The church\u2019s pattern of protecting itself over parishioners only made the scandal worse.\n\nFollowing the Globe\u2019s 2002 groundbreaking report on sexual abuse in Boston, the church impaneled eight bishops to investigate the abuse and root it out. But six of those bishops were, themselves, targets of criticism for ignoring or concealing abuse in their dioceses.\n\nThey were hardly the men who should have been in charge of a new policy. And, they proved it when they exempted themselves from oversight even though it was their failure to respond to the crisis which has perpetuated it. Indeed, reporters found that 130, or a third, of the nation\u2019s bishops have been accused of failing to stop abuse. At least 15 have, themselves, been accused of actual abuse.\n\nWith this deeply troubling behavior at the very top of the hierarchy, how can anyone trust the church to change? There was a chance when so-called reforms were drafted during a 2002 bishops meeting, but bishops kept themselves from being held accountable. Next week, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops will meet in Baltimore \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to imagine any real progress will be made.\n\nBecause the church seems incapable of policing itself, it should turn over its secret archives to the professionals \u2014 prosecutors who understand the law and know how to adjudicate crimes.\n\nThose records were the basis of a sweeping Aug. 14 Pennsylvania grand jury report. Without detailed accounts backed up by gut-wrenching testimony, Attorney General Josh Shapiro never would have been able to show that 301 priests abused more than 1,000 victims. Since the report\u2019s release, the attorney general has received 1,300 more complaints of clergy abuse, and Pennsylvania\u2019s investigation has sparked similar probes in more than a dozen states.\n\nBut as comprehensive as Shapiro\u2019s investigation was, only two priests were found guilty of sexually abusing children. That\u2019s because many of the incidents occurred so long ago, that the statutes of limitations have expired.\n\nLegislators should remove the caps on statutes of limitations, and let prosecutors do their jobs. If the civil cap is removed, more information can be learned through the discovery process about how the church covered up abuse, argues child advocate Marci Hamilton, head of the Philadelphia-based Child USA. That would give a truer picture of how widespread the abuse is.\n\nPennsylvania was on the cusp of these important reforms until last month when Senate President Pro Tempore Joseph Scarnati (R., Jefferson) and Majority Leader Jake Corman (R., Centre) killed the legislation. The House had already passed a bill in September, and Gov. Wolf promised to sign it. Church leaders\u2019 widespread cover-up of terrible acts are unforgivable. State lawmakers who remain standing in the way of justice for victims are just as culpable.\u2032\n\n__Philadelphia Inquirer\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2quwaYe\n\n___", "FILE - In this Sept. 30, 2018, file photo ,Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill watches from the sideline during the second half of an NFL football game against the New England Patriots in Foxborough, Mass.

Stronger gun control laws, protections for abortion rights and higher taxes on millionaires.\n\nDemocrats say those are just a few of their priorities after seizing control of the state Senate from Republicans. With Democrats already in charge of the state Assembly and occupying all four statewide offices, Tuesday\u2019s big wins in the Senate could clear the way for liberal proposals long blocked by the GOP.\n\n\u201cWe will finally give New Yorkers the progressive leadership they have been demanding,\u201d said Sen. Andrea Stewart-Cousins of Yonkers, who stands to lead the Senate in January. If that comes to pass, she will be the first woman and first African-American to lead the 63-member Senate.\n\nBut now that their proposals have a shot at passing, Democrats find that reality in Albany turns out to be more complicated.\n\nDemocrats scored big wins on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley to ensure that they\u2019ll have a convincing majority when the full Legislature reconvenes in January \u2014 though the final number won\u2019t be set until all the ballots are counted in coming days and weeks.\n\nRepublicans have controlled the chamber for decades, with a notable exception a decade ago when Democrats held a brief, and troubled majority. Before Tuesday\u2019s elections changed the math, the GOP held a one-seat majority, and then only thanks to a renegade Democrat, Sen. Simcha Felder of Brooklyn, who is allied with Republicans. Democrats already wield a commanding majority in the state Assembly and hold all four statewide offices.\n\nWith Democrats ascendant, left-leaning groups around the nation are counting on New York state to accomplish what they can\u2019t in Washington D.C.\n\n\u201cWith a unified, pro-choice majority in the state Senate to partner with our long-standing champions in the Assembly and executive branch, New York state is finally poised to become the beacon of reproductive freedom the country needs,\u201d said Andrea Miller, president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health, which supporters greater protections or abortion rights.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo, elected to a third term on Tuesday, could complicate the plans of liberals. In his first postelection interview Wednesday, he said he\u2019s eager to get to work with the Legislature to pass protections for abortion rights, election reforms, stronger gun control laws. But he also signaled that the Legislature will have to strike a balance.\n\nHe said Democrats won\u2019t hold the Senate for long if they pursue only liberal priorities \u2014 citing the brief, two-year Democratic majority a decade ago that saw them focus largely on New York City issues, only to quickly lose their grip on power amid corruption probes and dysfunction.\n\n\u201cI am a Democrat but we are New Yorkers first,\u201d he said during an interview Wednesday on WVOX radio in Westchester. \u201cI am aggressively progressive but I\u2019m also aggressively pro-economic development for this state.\u201d\n\nCuomo has largely governed as a moderate, supporting lower taxes, caps on spending and big subsidies to corporate interests. He\u2019s taken millions from wealthy real estate supporters, and many in his own party don\u2019t trust his liberal bona fides. He moved to the left this year during his primary matchup with former \u201cSex and the City\u201d star and political activist Cynthia Nixon. In one example, Cuomo criticized the idea of legalizing marijuana in 2017, only to come out in support this year.\n\nThe governor, considered a possible 2020 White House contender, could find himself under pressure from liberals to pass many of the proposals he has long said he supports, such as advance voting, the elimination of cash bail or tighter campaign finance limits. He could work to pass many of the less complicated ones while working to slow down more difficult, controversial or expensive proposals, according to Grant Reeher, director of the Alan K. Campbell Public Affairs Institute at Syracuse University.\n\nReeher singled out universal health care as a liberal priority that could prove especially difficult for Cuomo to accept. Creating a new publicly funded health care system won\u2019t be easy, but figuring out how to pay for it and sell the idea to a skeptical public could be just as hard. Raising taxes on the state\u2019s highest earners, which opponents say would devastate the economy, could be another tricky subject.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers, Reeher said, \u201chave already made pledges to constituents about what their agenda will be. Now it\u2019s real. I think the governor is going to be put in the position of applying the brakes on some of these things.\u201d\n\nRepublicans won\u2019t go away silently.

They did their civic duty, and they brought knowledge and understanding to the voting booths with them.\n\nFinally, all the candidates deserve our thanks for putting their names out there and spending so much time, effort and money trying to make a difference in our communities.\n\nEven if everyone were willing to vote, we would still need the brave and strong people who are willing to serve to be able select our representatives.\n\nHowever the elections turned out for you - win or lose - thank you so much for showing the commitment necessary to run and, if elected, to serve in difficult, often thankless posts that are nonetheless necessary for the functioning of our various governmental subdivisions.\n\nTuesday gave voters around the U.S. a chance to do what people elsewhere would fight and die to be able to do - participate in our own government.\n\nThank you and congratulations to all who seized the opportunity to exercise our American right to vote.\n\nOnline: http://www.houmatoday.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 6\n\nThe Advocate on teacher walkouts:\n\nIf the talk of walkouts of teachers and school employees has spread to Louisiana, it\u2019s in part because such extreme actions have been successful elsewhere.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if such tactics will work here, and we worry that the cause of increasing teacher pay and funding for public schools will suffer.\n\nFrom Arizona to Oklahoma to Tennessee \u2014 all, it has not escaped notice, politically conservative as is Louisiana \u2014 strikes or other types of walkouts at schools have generated crises that often as not resulted in overdue attention to teacher pay issues.\n\nNow, in Louisiana\u2019s capital city, employees recently planned a Halloween protest walkout to pressure the East Baton Rouge School Board to revoke some tax exemptions for the ExxonMobil refinery and chemical complexes in the city.\n\nThe walkout was canceled after the items targeted by the unions were not on the agenda of the state Board of Commerce and Industry. That board grants the breaks, but subsequently they must be confirmed by local governments, typically councils, school boards and sheriffs.\n\nProperty taxes are, after all, local government revenues. The ITEP program has long been a case of state government giving away other people\u2019s money. Yet there are wrinkles, in terms of policy and politics, that make it a difficult path forward for those who support paying teachers more.\n\nFor one thing, industrial facilities with big ITEP tax exemptions are not located in every parish. In New Orleans recently, the Orleans Parish School Board turned down an ITEP applicant from Algiers. However, unlike in St. James or St. Charles, or Baton Rouge-area parishes, rejecting ITEP applications is simply not going to be a big source of additional property tax revenues. The same is true of Lafayette Parish.\n\nFor another thing, the politics of rejecting exemptions in industrial parishes is not at all clear-cut.\n\nPublic bodies respond when their meeting rooms are filled with hundreds of workers from local plants who back ITEP exemptions because they will expand or keep open the facilities where they are employed. In many parishes, a drive against ITEP applications might lead to a backlash, creating a constituency against tax increases for teacher pay raises.\n\nAnd that is the third wrinkle in all this. The teacher walkouts in other states have often been met with raises from the state level. That is particularly true in Southern states, where the state capital is one of the major sources of operating funds for schools; in many other states, the balance between state and local revenues going to the schools is different, with local taxes paying employees and state money used for buildings.\n\nThe money for day-to-day operations in state government today (is) routinely threatened today by partisan gridlock in Louisiana. Expecting state revenues alone to be the sources for future teacher raises is unrealistic, meaning that unions and others supporting increases have to be worried about local political implications of threatened walkouts, like those in Baton Rouge.\n\nOnline: https://www.theadvocate.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 6\n\nAmerican Press of Lake Charles on national economic progress:\n\nThe jobs report released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday shows the economic progress the national economy is enjoying is real and continuing.\n\nThe unemployment rate held firm at a 50-year low of 3.7 percent in October, and 250,000 new jobs were created by a growing economy. Economist had forecast 200,000 new jobs, so the extra 50,000 was indeed good news.\n\nThere was also good news about wage growth, with a 3.1 percent raise for America\u2019s workers, which translates to an average $27.50 hourly pay rate.\n\nManufacturers added an impressive 32,000 jobs in a sector that was once thought to be in permanent decline. Health care led the job gains with 46,000; leisure and hospitality, 42,000; professional and business services, 35,000; and transportation and warehousing 25,000.\n\nIt was also good news that more workers are re-entering the now vibrant labor market, with those looking for jobs rising from 62.7 to 62.9 percent, which is the highest since July.\n\nWith such great economic progress being reported, this would be a good time for Congress to bring the national economy to the next level by passing the package of bills called \u201cTax Reform 2.0\u201d Act. The reform bills have been passed by the House of Representatives are now in the Senate for consideration.\n\nThis would build on the Tax Cut and Jobs Act that has been so successful in boosting the economy.\n\nThe non-partisan government watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste said one of the bills, H.R. 6757, the Family Savings Act of 2018, would create small universal savings accounts where individuals could contribute up to $2,500 into the accounts on an annual basis.\n\n\u201cThis best part: any withdrawals from these accounts would be tax free,\u201d according to CAGW. \u201cH.R. 6757 would also encourage retirement savings by making a number of reforms to existing retirement accounts. These changes include removing the prohibition that prevents individuals who have reached age 70 and one-half, from contributing to traditional Individual Retirement Accounts.\u201d\n\nThis is no time to sit on our laurels.

The outside spending dwarfed that of Goodson and Sterling. She lost her bid for chief justice two years ago after facing similar attacks.\n\n\u201cI was absolutely delighted the voters of Arkansas joined me in sending a message loud and clear to these out-of-state, dark money groups that their money is no good here,\u201d Goodson told The Associated Press Wednesday. \u201cArkansas courts are not for sale...It\u2019s about protecting the independence and integrity of the judiciary.\u201d\n\nThe Republican State Leadership Committee\u2019s Judicial Fairness Initiative spent more than $1.9 million on the high court race, most of which the Washington-based group spent in the weeks leading up to Tuesday\u2019s election.

A state judge earlier this year had temporarily blocked some TV stations from airing another ad from the Judicial Crisis Network. One of the TV stations has appealed that ruling, which was criticized by First Amendment advocates.\n\nGoodson has drawn the ire of conservatives for some court rulings, including a decision she authored in 2011 striking down Arkansas\u2019 cap on punitive damages in civil lawsuits. RSLC, which launched its initiative focused on state court races in 2014, and its donors this year have included the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, tobacco company Reynolds American, Bentonville-based Wal-Mart Stores and other major corporations.\n\nThe group saw victories elsewhere the night Goodson won. Two prominent Republicans backed by the group running for West Virginia\u2019s Supreme Court were elected to the high court Tuesday. The candidates \u2014 an ex-congressman and former state House speaker \u2014 had been appointed to serve on the court during the summer to fill the seats until Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nDouglas Keith, counsel for the Brennan Center, said outside group spending is significantly down from two years ago, when outside groups spent nearly $21 million on TV ads in court races. Keith said Brennan\u2019s estimates so far this year show about $5 million in outside TV spending in court races.\n\nKeith said he doesn\u2019t expect defeats in states like Arkansas to deter outside groups\u2019 involvement in races for courts, which will decide cases on redistricting, voting rights and other issues.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to think they\u2019ll be exiting the playing field anytime soon, particularly as state supreme courts are likely to get increasing attention as the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court becomes more solidified,\u201d Keith said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo", "Montana voters reject ballot initiative to increase cleanup standards on new mines in the state", "LINCOLN, Neb.

The measure will create and sustain an estimated 11,000 jobs, mostly in health care, and reduce financial pressure on counties that cover the cost of uninsured residents, said Kate Wolfe, a spokeswoman for the Insure the Good Life ballot campaign.\n\nWolfe said the measure is likely to reduce personal bankruptcies triggered by large medical debts, which collectively can become a drag on the economy. A study by two University of Nebraska at Kearney professors found that expanding Medicaid will generate an estimated $1.3 billion annually in economic activity.\n\n\u201cIn the long run, there are going to be some costs to the state,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cBut we know the benefits far outweigh the costs.\u201d\n\nLawmakers have not yet discussed how to pay for the expansion measure, but the issue may come up at their annual pre-session gathering later this month, said Sen. John Stinner, chairman of the budget-writing Appropriations Committee.\n\nStinner, a Republican who opposed the expansion measure, said he was concerned that the program\u2019s costs and the number of enrollees could grow faster than expected. Medicaid costs over the last 20 years have outpaced the natural growth of state revenue and expanding the program could accelerate that trend, he said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a challenge\u201d to fit it into the budget, said Stinner, of Gering. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t leave very much room for things like property taxes.\u201d\n\nOne option lawmakers and Ricketts might have to consider is cutting so-called optional programs within the current Medicaid program, said Jessica Shelburn, who campaigned against the ballot measure as state director of the fiscally conservative Americans for Prosperity-Nebraska.\n\nThe federal government requires state Medicaid programs to cover 13 services, including hospital and physician visits and laboratory work. But Nebraska also covers 19 optional services, such as dental and vision care and speech therapy.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a viable option to try to make this workable,\u201d Shelburn said. \u201cBut it comes at a heavy price tag for those who are receiving the services.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Grant Schulte on Twitter at https://twitter.com/GrantSchulte\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "RALEIGH, N.C.

That\u2019s, no doubt, why Learn the Risk, a nationwide nonprofit anti-vaccine lobbying group, chose the image of the late Nicholas Cantone to look at passing motorists as they read the words: \u201cAs a nurse, I was never taught vaccines can kill until my son was a victim.\u201d\n\nThe Cantones (Nicholas\u2019 father is retired mixed-martial arts fighter Nick Cantone) have blamed their son\u2019s death on a diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccination he received three weeks before he died. There is no evidence that is actually what happened.\n\n\u201cI certainly don\u2019t blame (the Cantones) for wanting better answers than what they have, but a situation like that will make somebody reach for an explanation that may not be proven,\u201d Dr. Michael Kilkenny, physician director for the Cabell-Huntington Health Department told The Herald-Dispatch after one of the billboards went up in downtown Huntington recently.\n\nWe don\u2019t blame them either. Their loss is horrific.\n\nBut it shouldn\u2019t be exploited, even with the family\u2019s permission, for more inroads against vaccinating children to keep them and those around them safe from an outbreak of disease.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time since West Virginians or the nation witnessed a run of contagious diseases through a classroom or school. It used to be common. Vaccines have curbed that problem, keeping children from becoming seriously ill or dying from an outbreak of measles, for example.\n\nThose infectious diseases have not been eradicated, but a well-vaccinated population keeps diseases from spreading far. In fact, when outbreaks have occurred, they have typically been among communities that have not received vaccinations, like the 400 cases of measles that surfaced in an Ohio Amish community in 2014.\n\nLynne Arvon, who was appointed by Gov. Jim Justice to fill a vacancy in the state Senate, helped in September to push for legislation to be introduced in the 2019 session to make it easier to get a vaccination exemption. Arvon\u2019s elevation to the Senate created a vacancy in the House of Delegates that Justice filled by appointing Chanda Adkins, a well-known anti-vaccine advocate.\n\nThe motion, approved in September interims, will result in drafting a bill allowing a doctor to grant a vaccination exemption, instead of the state Department of Health and Human Resources.\n\nNeither Arvon nor Adkins will be around to see if the legislation goes anywhere, as both lost in their Republican primaries.\n\nThere are reasons for children not to be vaccinated, but they are medical in nature, such as an allergy to a vaccine. In fact, children who can\u2019t be vaccinated are better protected when those around them have received those inoculations. The immunity of the group helps to stop the spread of disease, even to those who are medically unable to get their shots.\n\nThere should be no push to allow exemptions for religious purposes. Exemptions especially should not be granted based on pseudo-scientific beliefs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the things we get right,\u201d said Republican Sen. Tom Takubo, a physician, during a candidate meeting with Gazette-Mail editors in September.\n\nTakubo described U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maps that show a sort of \u201chalo\u201d around West Virginia and a few other states when it comes to outbreaks of infectious diseases.\n\n\u201cThere are risks that come with vaccinations ... however, the benefits outweigh the risks,\u201d Takubo said, adding \u201cevery single student\u201d coming into a West Virginia school who does not have a disqualifying medical condition should be vaccinated.\n\nVaccines protect millions. Perhaps the knowledge of life-altering and deadly diseases has receded too far in the public memory for people to take these diseases seriously now.\n\nOnline: https://www.wvgazettemail.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 7\n\nThe Parkersburg News and Sentinel on driving near school buses:\n\nMid-Ohio Valley residents care deeply about the safety of our kids. There is no doubt. But it takes only a second of distraction to turn a daily drive into a tragic situation.\n\nLikely every school bus driver in our area has watched in shock, fear and anger as motorists ignored flashing red lights and extended stop sign arms to pass his or her big yellow bus. It happens all too often, despite law enforcement agencies\u2019 focused attempts to stop it.\n\nLast week, five American children were killed by motorists for whom paying a little attention was too much of a bother.\n\nThree siblings \u2014 a 9-year-old girl and her twin 6-year-old brothers \u2014 were killed when they were struck by a pickup truck near Rochester, Ind. The children were crossing the road to get on their school bus, which was stopped with red lights flashing and a stop sign displayed.\n\nA 24-year-old woman who was driving the truck has been arrested. She insists she just didn\u2019t notice the bus.\n\nA similar situation occurred in Baldwyn, Miss. A 9-year-old boy died.\n\nAnd in Franklin Township, Pa., a 7-year-old boy was killed at his school bus stop, by a hit-and-run driver.\n\nAll five children died because drivers did not care enough for children to slow down just a little and watch for stopped school buses and/or children on streets and highways.\n\nAnother frequent occurrence is motorists zipping through plainly marked school zones \u2014 with children present \u2014 at well over the 15 mph speed limit.\n\nIt is something of a miracle that there have been no serious accidents in our area involving stopped school buses or school zones during the past several years. At some point, our luck will run out.\n\nPlease, pay enough attention that when a big, yellow school bus with flashing red lights and a stop sign is on the road in front of you, you see it.\n\nThe same goes for school zones where children are present at the same times each and every weekday.\n\nResolve to avoid the distractions that can cause such lapses in attention. Our kids are too important.\n\nOnline: http://www.newsandsentinel.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 7\n\nBluefield Daily Telegraph on the situation following midterm elections:\n\nFinally, after months of mudslinging, negative campaign attacks and finger pointing, it is over. The campaign season has ended. It\u2019s now time to heal and unite.\n\nThis was not a healthy election cycle for our nation, or for the coalfields of southern West Virginia and Southwest Virginia. The seemingly never-ending campaign attacks were divisive. And sometimes they were just downright silly. Yes, some of those television commercials wanted us to believe that both Joe Manchin and Patrick Morrisey were to blame for the opioid epidemic. Ridiculous.\n\nThis was also the first time that we can remember in recent history when some of the candidates themselves were less than forthcoming. Some even refused to be interviewed by the local media, ignoring our requests for an editorial board session. It is a troubling new day when candidates for a major West Virginia race refuse to speak to the press.\n\nBut we digress. It\u2019s over. Now we must begin the difficult process of uniting.\n\nIt is time to put all of the ugliness and anger behind us.\n\nToday we must begin the long but necessary process of healing our deep partisan divides. We must come together again as neighbors and as proud Americans.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t done so yet today, please go outside and shake your neighbor\u2019s hand. It doesn\u2019t matter if your neighbor is a liberal, a conservative or someone who thinks socialism is a good idea. Let go of the anger. And please \u2014 we do implore you here \u2014 resist the temptation to post a negative comment about your neighbor on Facebook.\n\nInstead, speak to your neighbor. Shake his or her hand. Smile. Be happy.\n\nIt\u2019s a new day.\n\nWe must now unite and realize that working together as one \u2014 all races, all genders, all ages \u2014 we are stronger. Together we can heal a nation and a state fractured of late by infighting, anger and political drama.\n\nWe must unite with our friends, neighbors and co-workers who may have stood on the other side of the red or blue line during the the long election cycle.\n\nAnd we must ask those in Washington to do the same.\n\nIt will not be easy. But it can be done. We can begin the process of healing, and uniting, today.\n\nOnline: https://www.bdtonline.com/", "", "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Women and minority voters helped propel Democrats to victory in Minnesota\u2019s top races. Health care was the top issue cited by voters in the midterm election and most believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, according to a wide-ranging survey of the American electorate.\n\nAs voters cast ballots for governor, U.S. Senate and members of Congress in Tuesday\u2019s elections, AP VoteCast found that 60 percent of Minnesota voters said the country is headed in the wrong direction, while 38 percent said it was on the right track.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in Minnesota, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 139,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 4,238 voters and 675 nonvoters in the state of Minnesota \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nTWO SENATE SEATS\n\nDemocrats retained both Minnesota Senate seats with strong support from women, minorities and moderate voters.\n\nSen. Tina Smith kept her seat in the special election for the Senate seat vacated by Al Franken, who resigned in January amid a sexual misconduct scandal.\n\nSmith led Republican state Sen. Karin Housley among women \u2014 58 percent to 36 percent \u2014 while the vote among men was split. She also led among voters under 45 while older voters were divided. Voters with a college education were more likely to favor Smith while those without a college degree were split.\n\nSmith was appointed to the vacancy by outgoing Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton; she was Dayton\u2019s lieutenant governor and former top aide.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar also easily won a third term, defeating Republican state Rep. Jim Newberger. Klobuchar also drew support from voters with and without a college education.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR GOVERNOR\n\nDemocratic Rep. Tim Walz defeated Republican Jeff Johnson in the race for Minnesota governor with strong support from women, urban voters and those under 45, keeping the state\u2019s top job in Democratic hands after Gov. Mark Dayton chose not to run for a third term.\n\nDavid Galle 49, a Minneapolis attorney, said he voted for Walz because, \u201cone thing that makes Minnesota great is a strong education system, and he\u2019s dedicated to that.\u201d\n\nTeacher Dennis Draughn said allowing vouchers to help parents send their children to private schools, which Johnson supports, would cause divisions and aggravate segregation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really like the idea of privatizing education,\u201d said Draughn, 33, of Minneapolis.\n\n___\n\nTOP ISSUE: HEALTH CARE\n\nHealth care was at the forefront of voters\u2019 minds: 35 percent of Minnesota voters named it as the most important issue facing the nation in this year\u2019s midterm elections, followed by immigration, cited by 19 percent of voters and the economy with 14 percent. Others said the environment and gun policy were top issues.\n\nSarah Roth, 22, of Minnetonka, Minnesota, said she voted for all Democrats because health care was so important.\n\n\u201cI think that having health care is a universal right that everybody in this country should have,\u201d said Roth, who works at an autism day treatment center for young children. \u201cPeople are dying from not having health care.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSTATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\nPhillip Baum, 63, of Minnetonka, said the economy is treating him well: He\u2019s a general contractor who has 30 employees and \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to live through another one of the Great Recessions.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s like the majority of Minnesota voters, who have a positive view of the nation\u2019s current economic outlook: 71 percent said the nation\u2019s economy is good, compared with 29 percent who said it\u2019s not.\n\nEven so, the grandfather of four \u2014 a moderate conservative \u2014 said tariffs are starting to affect him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned if they hold long-term, it will affect the economy, because I buy a lot of steel,\u201d Baum said.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP FACTOR AND CONTROL OF CONGRESS\n\nPresident Donald Trump affected the majority of voters in the midterm election, with 64 percent saying he was a factor in how they voted while 36 percent said he wasn\u2019t. Twenty-two percent of voters said a reason for their vote was to express support for Trump, but 42 percent said it was to oppose Trump.\n\nA majority of voters in Minnesota had negative views of Trump: 58 percent said they disapprove of how he is handling his job as president, while 41 percent said they approve of Trump.\n\nKathleen Lorence, a 60-year-old self-described \u201cdyed in the wool Republican,\u201d said she still supported President Donald Trump two years after voting for him \u2014 even if he \u201cshoots himself in the foot\u201d at times. She hoped voting for Republicans would give Trump reinforcements in Congress.\n\n\u201cI want to see what he\u2019s going to do for the next couple years,\u201d she said.\n\nSixty seven percent of Minnesota voters said which party will hold control of Congress was very important as they considered their vote. Another 23 percent said it was somewhat important.\n\n\u201cI think the past couple of years, ever since President Trump has been in office, it has just been not the country that I am used to or that I thought I would be in,\u201d Roth said. \u201cThis ... was my opportunity to help this country in changing who is making the decisions.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSTAYING AT HOME\n\nIn Minnesota, 70 percent of registered voters who did not vote in the midterm election were younger than 45. A wide share of those who did not vote \u2014 78 percent \u2014 did not have a college degree. Among nonvoters, 26 percent were Democrats and 34 percent were Republicans.\n\n___\n\nAP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate in all 50 states conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News. The survey of 4,238 voters and 675 nonvoters in Minnesota was conducted Oct. 29 to Nov. 6, concluding as polls close on Election Day. It combines interviews in English or Spanish with a random sample of registered voters drawn from state voter files and self-identified registered voters selected from opt-in online panels. Participants in the probability-based portion of the survey were contacted by phone and mail, and had the opportunity to take the survey by phone or online. The margin of sampling error for voters is estimated to be plus or minus 2.0 percentage points. All surveys are subject to multiple sources of error, including from sampling, question wording and order, and nonresponse.

He first applied for a passport using the child\u2019s identity in 1995 and again in 2004 without being detected.\n\nSolakian, 70, acquired a passport using the name of a 5-year-old child who died in 1953, and then moved to Northern California, where he was arrested earlier this year after his passport application came under scrutiny, the Press Democrat reported .\n\nSolakian was first arrested in 1994 by U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officers on suspicion of being part of a group that unloaded more than 7,000 pounds (3,175 kilograms) of marijuana from rafts onto a Santa Barbara beach. Officials said the pot had been brought to the California coastline on a sailboat from Colombia, according to a Los Angeles Times story at the time.\n\nSolakian, then a resident of Camarillo, was among seven men arrested in a dramatic nighttime scene with about 50 officers lighting the beach with flares and surrounding the suspects, according to the newspaper account.\n\nHe was scheduled for trial in January 1995, but he didn\u2019t show, according to a sentencing memo filed by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.

Technology and health care stocks are leading indexes broadly higher on Wall Street as results of the midterm elections came in largely as investors had expected. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The outcome of the midterm elections was good for the stock market in general, mostly because it didn\u2019t produce any big surprises, but it was especially good for the health care industry and several other companies.\n\nHealth insurers rose sharply Wednesday as investors anticipated that any prospects of repealing the Affordable Care Act, which expanded health insurance to millions of Americans, diminished greatly now that Democrats control the House of Representatives.\n\nMarijuana companies soared after several states voted to partly legalize pot, oil and gas companies benefited from the defeat of a ballot measure in Colorado that might have restricted drilling, and a dialysis services company rocketed higher after California voters rejected a measure that would have capped the profits of dialysis clinics.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at industries and companies that were affected in various ways by the outcome of the election.\n\nHEALTH CARE: Health insurers, hospital operators and companies that run Medicaid health programs all jumped. Democrats\u2019 victory in the House means Republicans won\u2019t be able to pass legislation repealing the 2010 Affordable Care Act, a goal for the party ever since the law was passed during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term. The bill expanded health insurance coverage, and the election results mean more stability for insurers and more reimbursement for hospitals.\n\nVoters in Idaho and Nebraska approved expansions of the federal-state Medicaid program, which provides benefits to poor and disabled people. Winning gubernatorial candidates in Maine and Kansas also support expanding Medicaid benefits to more people.\n\nThe largest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth added 4.2 percent to $274.63 and Anthem rose 6.6 percent to $289.94. The largest hospital company, HCA, gained 4.7 percent to $141.65. Medicaid services company Molina jumped 10.5 percent to $137.32.\n\nMARIJUANA STOCKS: Voters in Michigan passed a ballot measure to legalize marijuana while a similar measure in North Dakota was defeated. Missouri became the 31st state to approve marijuana for medical use, while Utah also voted on a medical marijuana proposition. A marijuana legalization measure in North Dakota was defeated.\n\nThe stocks built on their gains in the afternoon following the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Marijuana remains illegal at the federal level and Sessions had promoted more aggressive enforcement of those laws. Tilray soared 30.6 percent to $139.60 and Canopy Growth climbed 8.2 percent to $46.07.\n\nDIALYSIS DETAILS: Dialysis services company DaVita surged after California voters rejected a ballot measure that would have capped dialysis clinics\u2019 profits in an effort to improve patient care. Proposition 8 would have limited profits for dialysis clinics that provide vital treatment for people whose kidneys don\u2019t work properly. Dialysis companies contributed $111 million to oppose the bill, while proponents said it would stop companies from cutting corners to make more money and would force them to spend more of their money on caring for patients.\n\nDaVita gained 9.9 percent to $76.08.\n\nFRACKING FALLOUT: Oil drillers Anadarko Petroleum and Noble Energy rallied after Colorado voters rejected a measure that could have sharply reduced oil and gas drilling, including the method known as fracking, by requiring new oil and gas wells to be farther from occupied buildings than allowed under current law.\n\nAnadarko gained 5.7 percent to $57.89 and Noble picked up 4.2 percent to $28.16.\n\nGROWTH: Big tech and retail companies made huge gains. The stocks aren\u2019t expected to benefit from any specific vote or change in policy, but with the elections over, investors were willing to take bigger risks and bet that the global economy will keep growing. Amazon jumped 6.9 percent to $1,755.49 and Microsoft climbed 3.9 percent to $111.96.\n\nSafer, steadier stocks generally rose, but they didn\u2019t do as well as the rest of the market. Those stocks had surged in October as the rest of the market struggled, but on Wednesday, utility company AES fell 2.6 percent to $15.60.

You execute it, he can do it.\u201d\n\nNext up for the Badgers (6-3, 4-2 Big Ten) is a visit to No. 21 Penn State on Saturday, a game that will allow Jonathan Taylor\u2019s family and friends to make the relatively short trip from his hometown of Salem, New Jersey.\n\n\u201cIf I go back East, a lot more of my family members get to come. It\u2019s always a good time when they get to see you play,\u201d he said.\n\nIt would be even sweeter for the star sophomore if he could have another big game.\n\nTaylor bounced back from a 46-yard outing on 11 carries in a 31-17 loss at Northwestern with 208 yards and three scores on 27 carries in a win over Rutgers last week. The touchdown run that had his even his offensive linemen talking was an 18-yarder later in the third quarter giving the Badgers a 24-3 lead.\n\n\u201cHe took a power run backside and the last time I saw someone do that was Melvin,\u201d right tackle David Edwards said after the game, referring to former Badger and current San Diego Chargers tailback Melvin Gordon.\n\nBeau Benzschawel, Wisconsin\u2019s athletic, 6-foot-6 right guard, was pulling on the play in which he was designed to be a lead blocker.\n\nTaylor had other ideas and sprinted to the right for the score.\n\n\u201cI was like, he wasn\u2019t behind me. He should have been behind me,\u201d Benzschawel recounted on Wednesday.\n\nNot that he was really surprised by Taylor\u2019s move. He has been blocking for Taylor for nearly two seasons now.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a bag of tricks that he has,\u201d he said.\n\nAveraging 151.4 yards a game, Taylor leads major college teams this season in both 100-yard games (eight) and 200-yard games (three).\n\nThe visit at Beaver Stadium would be a good time for Taylor to break loose again for Wisconsin. The Badgers have lost their last two Big Ten road games, at Michigan and Northwestern, to drop them out of first place in the West Division.\n\nTaylor was limited by the Wildcats in a game in which starting quarterback Alex Hornibrook didn\u2019t play because he was in the concussion protocol. Hornibrook is in the protocol again this week after getting hurt again last week against Rutgers, leaving him questionable for the Penn State game.\n\nJack Coan would make his second career start if Hornibrook can\u2019t play. Wisconsin might need the sophomore to show he can move the ball through the air in a tough road environment to take at least some pressure off the running game.\n\nThen again, the Badgers ran the ball for all 13 plays of the third quarter against Rutgers, after Coan reliever Hornibrook. They still played away for a win.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone against some guys that you know are going to get you the tough yards ... six or four yards or eight yards,\u201d Penn State coach James Franklin said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone against some guys that can take it the distance,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to find a guy that can do all those things.\u201d\n\nTaylor possesses the vision and ability to find a new hole quickly after one closes. He\u2019ll hear about it from his blockers, too.\n\nAnd like any good running back, he\u2019s shows them gratitude, too.\n\n\u201cSometimes I come back and O-linemen are saying \u2018Way to see it, JT,\u2019\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to get some appreciation from those guys knowing that I\u2019m doing the best that I can to use their hard-earned work to the fullest and not waste it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Democrat candidate for Harris County Judge, Lina Hidalgo, talks with campaign volunteers outside of a polling place located at the SPJST Lodge 88 in the Heights, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018 in Houston.

(Mark Mulligan/Houston Chronicle via AP)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 A Democratic awakening in Texas stopped shy of putting Beto O\u2019Rourke in the U.S. Senate, but in Houston one major upset prevailed: a 27-year-old Colombian immigrant, who has no political experience, was elected as the top official of the nation\u2019s third-largest county.\n\nDemocrat Lina Hidalgo came to the U.S. as a teenager in 2005, just two years before popular Republican Harris County Judge Ed Emmett took office and later steered Houston through some of the nation\u2019s biggest natural disasters.\n\nNow Hidalgo has his job after ousting him in a historic and narrow victory Tuesday night that was largely unexpected, but also a clear signal of Democrats having new life in Texas after decades of lopsided defeats and little political power outside big urban cities.\n\n\u201cEasily the most under appreciated upset in Texas,\u201d tweeted Julian Castro, former President Barack Obama\u2019s housing secretary, who is leaning toward making his own presidential run in 2020.\n\nMany Democrats on the ballot in Texas this year had their chances propelled by O\u2019Rourke, who energized his party like no other candidate in a generation. He lost by fewer than three percentage points to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in what was closest Senate race in Texas in 40 years.\n\nHidalgo, who graduated from Stanford University and has worked as a translator at a Houston hospital, becomes the top elected official in a county of 4.7 million people \u2014 smaller only than Los Angeles County in California and Cook County in Illinois, which surrounds Chicago. She is also the first Latina elevated to the job in Harris County, which is among the most diverse in the country.\n\nIn Texas, the title of \u201ccounty judge\u201d is a misnomer.

That makes the job especially high-profile and powerful in Houston, where disasters like Hurricane Harvey and flooding have wreaked havoc in recent years.\n\nHidalgo joins 29-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cotez, the New York congresswoman-elect, as Democrats under 30 with no political experience who defied the odds in big races in the 2018 midterms.\n\nHidalgo has never attended a meeting of Harris County\u2019s governing commissioners court, the Houston Chronicle reported .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing victory and it\u2019s about everyone coming together for a better community,\u201d Hidalgo told reporters after her victory Tuesday night. \u201cA county government people can see, a county government people can feel. A county government that makes sure Harris County is at the forefront.\u201d\n\nHidalgo ran on better flood control and criminal justice reform.

(AP Photo/David Goldman)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Malfunctioning voting machines, missing power cords and hourslong lines at the polls are being scrutinized by candidates and election officials in Georgia, where the governor\u2019s race is undecided while votes are still being tallied.\n\nDemocrat Stacey Abrams, vying to become the nation\u2019s first female black governor, trails Georgia\u2019s Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp, the state\u2019s chief elections official. Ballots are still being counted, and Abrams\u2019 campaign thinks she may have enough for a runoff. Kemp\u2019s campaign declared victory Wednesday night. The Associated Press has not called the contest.\n\nMultiple lawsuits have been filed in the contentious race, with voting rights groups contending that Kemp has used his office to interfere in the election for his own benefit. He has fiercely denied any impropriety.\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday, President Donald Trump said he heard the voting process was \u201cvery efficient\u201d in Georgia. But polling places across the state had long lines, and some areas of metro Atlanta that typically lean Democratic experienced problems and delays.\n\nOntaria Woods arrived at a polling place in Snellville, just northeast of Atlanta, about 7 a.m. Tuesday to vote. More than three hours later, she was still waiting, with roughly 75 to 100 people in line.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the majority of people in this line, African-Americans,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re begging them, \u2018Please, stay.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith votes approaching 3.8 million, Kemp has just more than 50 percent of the vote, which would give him the majority threshold required for victory. But Abrams and her campaign say they believe there are enough ballots still uncounted to force a runoff. To do that, Abrams needs to pick up about 15,000 votes among an unknown number of ballots across the state, her campaign officials said Wednesday.\n\nSome of the longest lines on Election Day formed at polling places near historically black colleges in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of college students over there, and they like to vote out of precinct,\u201d said Richard Barron, director of registration and elections in Fulton County, which includes most of Atlanta.\n\n\u201cWhen you vote out of your precinct, you have to vote a provisional ballot,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd provisional ballots create lines because they take longer to process.\u201d\n\nA court ordered extended voting hours in two polling sites near the colleges. The last voter from those sites cast a ballot about 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, Barron said.\n\nThe state elections chief wasn\u2019t immune to the difficulties: When Kemp went to cast his ballot, he had an issue with his voter card, but it was fixed quickly.\n\nThe same or similar problem affected voters in four large precincts in Gwinnett County\u2014 a populous swing county \u2014 and at least one in the Inman Park neighborhood of Atlanta, election security expert Harri Hursti said Wednesday. Voters in those places were not able to vote for hours because the electronic poll books used to check in voters were not writing to the smart cards needed to cast ballots, Hursti said.\n\n\u201cWhen those machines are down, it eliminates the possibility of voting with the touch screens,\u201d said Joe Sorenson, a Gwinnett County spokesman.\n\nIn Snellville, some machines poll workers use to check in voters didn\u2019t have power cords and ran out of batteries. Paper ballots were handed out for about 15 minutes before the issue was resolved.\n\n\u201cIt was a human error issue,\u201d Sorenson said. \u201cA person who packed that machine didn\u2019t pack it properly, and the person who set it up should have noticed it.\u201d\n\nFulton County\u2019s Barron said that although Kemp is secretary of state, \u201che doesn\u2019t have any say in county operations.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people see things on social media or they are really quick to assign nefarious intentions to people, especially like my staff who are just dedicated public servants,\u201d he said. \u201cThey assign these intentions or motivations to them that couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. I think it\u2019s unfortunate that the distrust in government has reached a point that it has.\u201d\n\nGeorgia is one of only five states that exclusively uses electronic voting machines that computer scientists have long criticized as untrustworthy because they are easily hacked and don\u2019t leave a paper trail. A federal judge in September scolded elections officials for not heeding experts\u2019 warnings and continuing to use the aging machines.\n\nFive Georgia voters sued Kemp on Election Day, asking a judge to prevent Kemp from exercising his duties as the state\u2019s top elections official for anything having to do with Tuesday\u2019s election, including certifying results or administering any possible runoff or recount. The lawsuit says that Kemp presiding over an election in which he is a candidate \u201cviolates a basic notion of fairness.\u201d\n\nSecretary of state\u2019s office spokeswoman Candice Broce called the lawsuit a \u201ctwelfth-hour stunt.\u201d\n\nA federal judge set a hearing for Thursday.\n\nSeparately, Common Cause Georgia filed a lawsuit Monday seeking special treatment of some provisional ballots.

I just thought I was fine coming out of the game and went through protocol and that\u2019s just kind of how it went. Went through some of the tests and something was obviously a little different than usual.\u201d\n\nDarnold dealt with a broken foot in high school that sidelined him for most of his junior season. He said this is not close to as serious an injury.\n\n\u201cLike any injury, I\u2019m just going to go about protocol and do exactly what the trainers do and be in here as much as possible and get better,\u201d he said.\n\nIf Darnold is unable to start, 39-year-old backup Josh McCown would take his place. McCown was the starter last season, but hasn\u2019t taken a snap this year as Darnold won the job out of training camp \u2014 beating out both McCown and Teddy Bridgewater.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in a backup role, you just go in and do your job,\u201d McCown said. \u201cThat\u2019s the main thing. We\u2019ll prepare as if \u2014 like I do every week \u2014 I\u2019m going to be the starter and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d\n\nDarnold has struggled mightily during the Jets\u2019 three-game losing streak, and he leads the NFL with 14 interceptions.\n\nThe No. 3 overall draft pick in April has thrown for 1,934 yards and 11 touchdowns, but his 55.0 percent completion rate and 68.3 quarterback rating rank at the bottom of the league. In his past three games, Darnold has thrown two TD pass and seven interceptions.\n\nThe struggles had some fans and media wondering if perhaps Darnold would benefit from sitting a game or two.\n\nNow, it appears he and the Jets might not have a choice.\n\nNew York has its bye-week break after the game Sunday against Buffalo, and then doesn\u2019t play again until Nov. 25, when the Jets take on New England. That could give Darnold a few weeks to rest and heal the foot without missing much time.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to rush things,\u201d Darnold said. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing we don\u2019t want to do. I\u2019m eager to get back out there on the field with my guys, but at the same time, I\u2019ve got to take care of my body, first and foremost.\u201d\n\nNOTES: WRs Robby Anderson (ankle) and Quincy Enunwa (ankle), TE Neal Sterling (concussion), S Terrence Brooks (illness), C Spencer Long (knee/finger) and NT Steve McLendon didn\u2019t practice. ...

Cuba has invited a record number of expatriate dancers to its international dance festival. (AP Photo/Desmond Boylan)\n\nHAVANA (AP) \u2014 As a young dancer compared with ballet legends Vaslav Nijinsky and Mikhail Baryshnikov, Rolando Sarabia made headlines around the world when he abandoned Cuba in 2005 for a career in the United States.\n\nHe didn\u2019t dance in his homeland for 13 years, banned as part of a wider Cuban punishment of citizens who illegally left the country.\n\nStill lean and powerful at 36, a company dancer for The Washington Ballet, Sarabia stalked across the stage last month in the starring male role in \u201cGisselle\u201d at Cuba\u2019s National Theater. Asked about his feelings upon performing once again in Cuba, he began to cry.\n\nSarabia and four other renowned defectors from the Cuban National Ballet took the stage at the 26th Havana International Ballet Festival as part of a wide-ranging and profound reconciliation between Cuba and its millions of expatriates and exiles around the world.\n\n\u201cHappiness, happiness. I just don\u2019t have any other words,\u201d Sarabia\u2019s brother and fellow dance star Daniel told The Associated Press after a rehearsal of the \u201cGrand Pas Classique.\u201d \u2033This is something big. Global stars have come but even more important are those of us who\u2019ve left. This is my audience, my Cuban audience.\u201d\n\nThe country did away with the hated \u201cwhite card\u201d exit permit in 2013, allowing Cubans to leave freely for any country that would grant a visa. The change unleashed a wave of emigration that continues to this day, with tens of thousands leaving annually for destinations around the world. Also in 2013, Cuba allowed citizens to retain all of their rights \u2014 from free health care to owning property \u2014 as long as they at least briefly returned every two years.\n\nThose 2013 changes unleashed an opposite wave of more than 40,000 Cubans who have repatriated and reclaimed the same rights as residents. At the same time, Cuba\u2019s state-controlled cultural and sports institutions began opening to stars who left, allowing musicians who went abroad like singers Isaac Delgado, Kelvis Ochoa, Decemer Bueno and Raul Paz to live and perform in Cuba again, and welcoming baseball players like Dodger Yasiel Puig at official state events.\n\nCuba\u2019s relationship with its citizens overseas remains highly fraught and painful in many circumstances, particularly for families who left the height of the revolution \u2014 publicly cursed in state-organized \u201cacts of repudiation,\u201d with their life\u2019s work confiscated by the state and handed over to strangers. Many Cubans abroad have sworn never to return while the island\u2019s Communist government remains in power.\n\nBut tens of thousands of others are reconciling with the state. They include Rolando Sarabia; his brother Daniel of the Maurice Bejart Ballet in Switzerland; San Francisco ballet dancer Taras Domitro; Marize Fumero of the Milwaukee Ballet; Carlos Quenedit of the Houston Ballet; and retired star Lorna Feijoo, a fierce critic of 96-year-old Cuban ballet director Alicia Alonso. Their return is one of the most symbolically charged reconciliations, given the immense importance Cuba places on its prestigious state-run ballet program.\n\nThe stars\u2019 return began during the warming between Cuba and the United States begun by presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro in December 2014. A year or two later, a Cuban ballet official traveled to Miami and met with a group of former national dancers, who said they wanted to return to perform in Cuba.\n\nThe dancers wrote a letter requesting permission and, unlike in previous years, ballet director Alonso and the then-Minister of Culture expressed no objection to the dancers\u2019 return, according to a Cuban official with knowledge of the process who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the process. The plans were not derailed by the broader chilling of relations under President Donald Trump, who has tightened regulations on travel to Cuba and hardened official discourse toward the island.\n\n\u201cThis is the correct path,\u201d said Domitro, who defected during a tour of Canada in 2007, one of the highest-profile departures from Alonso\u2019s company. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about ballet; we have nothing to do with politics.\u201d\n\nCuba continues to try to repair relations with expatriates despite the chilling of relations with the country that\u2019s home to 1.5 million of the 2 million living Cubans outside the island, a number one-fifth the size of the country\u2019s actual population.\n\nForeign Minister Bruno Rodriguez announced last year that Cuba would be slightly easing onerous documentation requirements for returning Cubans, and easing the process of obtaining citizenship for children born overseas.\n\nIn September, President Miguel Diaz-Canel held high-profile meetings with expatriate Cubans in New York, including many who have been criticized by hard-liners on the island.\n\nDiaz-Canel said the expatriate community had become ideologically diverse and an important source of support for Cuba.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re counting on you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are all Cuba.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nAndrea Rodriguez on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ARodriguezAP", "LEXINGTON, Ky.

Democrats argue that the Republicans ignored many key facts and witnesses.\n\nA congressional probe would be more public than special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s current investigation into Russian election interference \u2014 and wouldn\u2019t run the risk of being shut down by Trump.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denies any involvement in Trump\u2019s election victory, and the Kremlin shrugged off concerns that a Democratic-controlled House would increase pressure on Russia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be hard to make (the relationship) even worse,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday.\n\nA renewed investigation could serve Kremlin interests by deepening division in America\u2019s political arena. What Putin would not favor would be investigations or sanctions that would further damage the well-connected Russian oligarchs believed to have links to Trump, or to have helped fund U.S. meddling efforts.\n\nRepublicans warn that more investigations could blow back against the Democrats for the 2020 U.S. election.\n\nPRESSURE ON THE SAUDIS\n\nThen there\u2019s Saudi Arabia, and the relationship between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The ties between the two men, who are said to communicate frequently, could come under increased scrutiny by Democrats.\n\nThe U.S. and Saudi Arabia have long been key allies, and Trump made the country his first stop abroad as president.\n\nBut the crown prince has lost supporters in Congress since the Oct. 2 killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and a critic of the crown prince, inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. The slaying was allegedly carried out by agents close to the prince.\n\nDemocrats could try to block major arms sales to Saudi Arabia and curtail U.S. support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen, which the prince launched as defense minister in 2015. The conflict has become widely unpopular with some members of Congress, and aid agencies say it has created the world\u2019s largest humanitarian catastrophe, with millions facing starvation amid a Saudi blockade of the Arab world\u2019s poorest country.\n\nThe U.S. assists the Saudi-led coalition with in-air refueling and intelligence on targets, and supplies the kingdom with fighter jets and bombs used in the war.\n\nTRADEMARKS IN CHINA\n\nDemocrats could also look into businesses in the Trump family\u2019s business empire \u2014 notably the 18 trademarks that China has granted in recent months to companies linked to Trump and his daughter Ivanka.\n\nSome question whether they represent a conflict of interest. China says it handles all trademark applications equally, but House committees could probe whether Beijing can exploit the Trump family\u2019s substantial intellectual property holdings in China to its political or diplomatic advantage.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much to the Trump administration that could be investigated, it\u2019s an unprecedented situation of major business entanglements around the world,\u201d said Dana Allin, senior fellow with the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to rule out the idea that foreign policy decisions are not being kept separate from business interests.\u201d\n\nChina would not talk publicly about the U.S. election results. \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on that, otherwise I will run the risk of being accused of interfering in their midterm election,\u201d foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.\n\nWHAT WON\u2019T CHANGE\n\nTrump is still the one in charge and is not expected to change his America-first strategy, or stop running roughshod over erstwhile allies when it serves his interests.\n\nA Democratic House isn\u2019t going to put the U.S. back in the Iranian nuclear accord or the Paris climate agreement, and is unlikely to challenge Trump\u2019s protectionist line on trade.\n\n\u201cMany Democrats support the president\u2019s trade agenda,\u201d lamented Dieter Kempf, the head of the Federation of German Industries, the main business lobby group in Germany, a leading exporter. \u201cThe U.S. administration\u2019s confrontational course is and remains a danger to the world economy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSullivan reported from New Delhi.

(Curtis Compton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Two Republican members of Congress faced a risk of losing their seats Wednesday as election returns showed them in perilously tight races with Democratic challengers in a pair of suburban Atlanta districts long considered safe for the GOP.\n\nThe races of GOP Reps. Karen Handel and Rob Woodall remained too close to declare a winner the day after polls closed, and campaigns said absentee ballots were still being counted Wednesday morning.\n\nHandel\u2019s opponent, Democratic gun-control activist Lucy McBath, claimed victory Wednesday afternoon in the 6th District seat once held by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.\n\nThe Associated Press has not declared a winner in either congressional race. Unofficial election results Wednesday showed vote margins separating both sets of rivals hovered close to a mere 1 percent \u2014 the threshold that would allow the runner-up in either race to be granted a recount once the final results are certified.\n\n\u201cAfter a hard fought race, I am honored to announce that the people of Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District have put their trust in my vision for the future of our district and nation,\u201d McBath said in an emailed statement.\n\nHandel isn\u2019t conceding. Her campaign responded with a short statement that said it\u2019s too soon to predict the outcome.\n\n\u201cGiven the close results of our race, and the fact that the official results at this time are within the 1% threshold where a recount is possible, we believe it is prudent to review and assess all data before making additional actions or statements,\u201d Handel\u2019s statement said.\n\nThe unsettled contests will determine if Democrats add to their majority after winning control of the U.S. House in the Tuesday midterm elections. Georgia Democrats saw an opening in both districts as demographic shifts have made Atlanta\u2019s suburbs less white. They also sought to capitalize on college-educated voters disaffected with President Donald Trump.\n\nHandel\u2019s 6th District seat is the same battleground where last year Democrat Jon Ossoff spent $30 million and still failed in a closely watched special election that sent Handel to Washington.\n\nIn the neighboring 7th District, four-term GOP incumbent Rob Woodall struggled against Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux, a college professor who outpaced the congressman in total fundraising.\n\nWoodall\u2019s campaign manager, Derick Corbett, said the campaign had no immediate comment Wednesday. Bourdeaux\u2019s campaign spokesman, Jake Best, said they were still waiting for absentee ballots to be counted in Gwinnett County.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019re getting closer,\u201d Best said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know how much is left.\u201d\n\nGeorgia law guarantees an election recount if a losing candidate requests it after finishing behind the winner by a vote margin of 1 percent or less. Because in-person votes are cast electronically in Georgia, with no auditable paper trail, a recount mostly consists of re-tabulating digital votes already stored on machines. Those results aren\u2019t likely to change.\n\nHowever, absentee votes and provisional votes \u2014 those cast by voters whose eligibility is challenged at the polls \u2014 are still cast on paper ballots in Georgia. Counting those a second time has produced minor changes in the vote total during prior elections.\n\nMcBath ran on strengthening gun laws and received national attention as she campaigned as a \u201cmother on a mission.\u201d McBath\u2019s 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was fatally shot at a Florida gas station in 2012 by a white man angry over the loud music the black teenager and his friends were playing in their car. She later became a national spokeswoman for the group Everytown for Gun Safety.\n\nWoodall has represented suburban Atlanta\u2019s 7th District since 2011. The Republican won each of his prior elections with no less than 60 percent of the vote. Rather than distance himself from Trump, Woodall campaigned as an experienced lawmaker who could \u201cget results from this president.\u201d\n\nBourdeaux is a professor of public management and policy at Georgia State University in Atlanta and once worked at the state Capitol as director of Georgia\u2019s Senate Budget and Evaluation Office. She raised more than $1.9 million for the race as of Sept. 30, compared to Woodall\u2019s $1.02 million.", "FILE - In this March 10, 2018 file photo, yellow police tape surrounds the Pathway Home building that housed a veterans program in Northern California a day after a deadly shooting in Yountville, Calif.

The nonprofit program Pathway Home leased space from the home and treated 500 veterans.

He also had packed extra magazines and ammunition, and he was wearing eye protection and ear protection. The CHP took over management of the incident because the home is on state property.\n\nInvestigators say Wong burst into a going-away party for one of the treatment program workers and ordered all the veterans in the second-floor room to leave.

Pro-expansion advocates continued arguing Republican Gov. Paul LePage\u2019s administration broke the law by stalling expansion, while the governor\u2019s outside lawyer argued the matter is up to lawmakers and not the courts.\n\nNearly three out of five Mainers last fall approved expanding Medicaid to 70,000 low-income residents, following five Medicaid expansion attempts that LePage vetoed. But the referendum didn\u2019t include a funding source for Maine\u2019s share, and LePage has opposed expansion over his financial concerns.\n\nDemocratic Attorney General Janet Mills, who won Tuesday\u2019s gubernatorial election, said Wednesday that she will \u201cabsolutely\u201d propose a plan to fund Maine\u2019s share of Medicaid expansion, which could eventually cost Maine alone $54.5 million each year. LePage has informally proposed taxing hospitals to pay for expansion, though the idea has caught criticism from the Maine Hospital Association.\n\nLePage vetoed a bill to fund Medicaid expansion\u2019s first year with budgetary surplus and one-time tobacco settlement funds. The governor dismissed the bill as relying on \u201cbudgetary gimmicks,\u201d and lawmakers failed to override his veto.\n\nA pro-Medicaid expansion group says LePage\u2019s administration is violating the spirit of a recent court order to submit paperwork for $525 million in eventual annual federal funding for Medicaid expansion. Maine submitted the paperwork, but LePage urged federal regulators to reject it.\n\nJustice Murphy is tasked with deciding whether lawmakers must specifically set aside money before expanding Medicaid. She will also weigh in on Medicaid expansion\u2019s official start date.\n\nMaine has enough existing Medicaid funds in theory to cover expansion costs through May 2019, according to the Legislature\u2019s nonpartisan fiscal office.\n\nBut the LePage administration claims that the money could run out faster if enrollments exceed expectations.\n\nA private lawyer for the LePage administration is also arguing that Maine lawmakers have at times specifically set aside money for previous Medicaid expansions.\n\n\u201cIt was widely understood and was made explicit to voters that additional legislation was going to be necessary to implement the expansion of the program,\u201d attorney Patrick Strawbridge said.\n\nThe governor should implement the laws and then deal with budget questions later, argued Charles Dingman, lawyer for Maine Equal Justice Partners, which sued LePage\u2019s administration this spring for blocking expansion.\n\nIt comes down to whether Maine\u2019s executive branch has the authority to stall a law approved by voters at the polls simply because of a policy disagreement, argued lawyer James Kilbreth, lawyer for Maine Equal Justice Partners.\n\nState government, he added, must implement laws rather than say: \u201d\u2018Never mind, I don\u2019t like this law.\u2019\u201d", "The Latest: 2 California down-ballot races too close to call\n\nKatie Hill, a Democratic Party candidate from California's 25th congressional district speak waves at supporters during an election watch party Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Santa Clarita, Calif.

Even so, voters were divided over the state of the nation, according to a wide-ranging survey of the American electorate.\n\nAP VoteCast found that Indiana voters were split on whether the country is on the right track, with 52 percent saying the country is on the right track and 47 percent saying it\u2019s headed in the wrong direction.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in Indiana, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 139,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 3,938 voters and 765 nonvoters in the state of Indiana \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR SENATE\n\nRepublican Mike Braun unseated incumbent Democratic Sen.

A sizeable share of those who identified with other religions and denominations also supported Braun.\n\nDonnelly led among urban voters \u2014 61 percent to 34 percent \u2014 while Braun received heavy rural support with 65 percent of the vote.

It combines interviews in English or Spanish with a random sample of registered voters drawn from state voter files and self-identified registered voters selected from opt-in online panels. Participants in the probability-based portion of the survey were contacted by phone and mail, and had the opportunity to take the survey by phone or online.

But the fund\u2019s authorization expired at the end of September, and Congress left for its autumn recess without renewing it.\n\nWhen it reconvenes in a lame duck session after Veterans Day, Congress should permanently reauthorize the fund and ensure that the fees are used for their intended purposes: to acquire and protect natural areas and to make grants to states for outdoor access and recreation.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be this hard. The fund and the many projects it pays for have wide, bipartisan support. But reauthorization has become a pawn in ideological arguments over the federal government\u2019s role in acquiring and holding land.\n\nThe Land and Water Conservation Fund is perhaps the least widely known, but by no means the least important, of six essential environmental programs created by Congress in the 1960s, largely under the leadership of Stewart Udall, who served as Interior secretary under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. Ironically, the other five pieces of legislation \u2014 the Wilderness Act, the Water Quality Act, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act \u2014 may be better known because they have been, at various times, more controversial.\n\nOn its adoption in 1964, the Land and Water Conservation Fund allowed the federal government to purchase land using revenue from recreation fees. A later amendment supplemented funding with royalties on oil and gas leases on the outer continental shelf, and those fees have now become the primary revenue source, to the tune of about $40 billion thus far.\n\nProjects include acquisitions of narrow but crucial strips of land adjacent to national parks \u2014 for example, a parcel next to Joshua Tree National Park that was slated for real estate development \u2014 and access strips to open up existing public areas to recreation. A matching-grant program allows states to develop and enhance urban parkland, creating dozens of parks in Los Angeles County alone, including baseball and soccer fields.\n\nMatching grants also can be used to protect water supplies. Many of the state and local bond measures that Californians have adopted to respond to drought and to provide water security rely on federal matching funds \u2014 and many of those matches have come from the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n\nFederal law allows up to $900 million to be appropriated each year, which is less than the amount of revenue flowing in; as a result, billions of dollars sit in the fund unused. But money doesn\u2019t actually come out of the fund until Congress appropriates it. And Congress routinely did, with bipartisan backing and without controversy, until several years ago, when some lawmakers tried to link the fund and its grants to the controversy over federal land ownership and management in Western states.\n\nBut even lawmakers who are partial to this so-called sagebrush rebellion recognize that the link between their grievances and the Land and Water Conservation Fund is weak. Just over three years ago, they tabled their philosophical arguments and reached a short-term deal to keep the fund in business. That deal expired on Sept. 30.\n\nThe House Committee on Natural Resources approved a reauthorization bill on Sept. 13. Shortly after the current authorization expired, a Senate committee advanced its own version of the proposal. But lawmakers disagreed over details and never got a bill to the floor of either chamber.\n\nThe danger now is that a final deal on the fund will fall through the cracks as lawmakers argue over funding for the border wall and other controversial topics. That would be a shame. It ought to be easy to reach final agreement on a bill for which there is bipartisan support. It is low-hanging fruit, and Congress ought to pluck it as soon as it reconvenes.\n\n___\n\nNov. 6\n\nThe Mercury News on the No. 1 priority for Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom:\n\nThe election of Gavin Newsom as the state\u2019s next governor marks a new era in California politics. Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s prudent management of the state\u2019s limited financial resources will be a thing of the past.\n\nIf Newsom\u2019s time as San Francisco\u2019s mayor is any indication, he is more likely than Brown to think and talk big.\n\nBut he won\u2019t be able to act big without significant changes in state priorities and funding.\n\nFor starters, he should dump the costly high-speed rail and Delta twin-tunnels boondoggles that Brown unwisely viewed as his legacy projects. That would stamp Newsom as a common-sense governor who understands financial realities.\n\nThen Newsom should get to the state\u2019s biggest challenge: tax reform.\n\nWe know, we know. It isn\u2019t sexy. It won\u2019t garner the sort of headlines his \u201clike-it-or-not\u201d edict on same-sex marriage generated 14 years ago. But fixing California\u2019s convoluted tax system would give Newsom his only real chance to pursue and deliver on the promises he repeatedly pushed during the campaign.\n\nConsider that wish list: universal health care, universal preschool, universal prenatal care, free community college tuition for two years, more funding for higher education, cradle-to-career education, building hundreds of thousands of housing units by 2025 to ease the homeless and housing crisis. And that\u2019s just for starters.\n\nThe projected costs simply don\u2019t pencil out without a complete financial overhaul. Especially so during the inevitable, and now overdue, economic downturn. Brown has been warning that a moderate recession would blow a $60 billion hole in California\u2019s budget.\n\nThe state\u2019s tax structure is overly reliant on revenues from income taxes, making the state flush with money during strong economic times and short on funding during downturns. California\u2019s additional dependence on its high sales tax only worsens the problem.\n\nHow bad is the current tax structure? Nearly three decades ago, personal income tax accounted for 35 percent of the state\u2019s general fund revenues. In more recent years, it\u2019s closer to double that amount.\n\nNow is the time for serious action on tax reform: A ballot box battle royale on Proposition 13 is looming in 2020 with a proposed measure to tax business and industrial properties based on regular assessments of their value. The prospect should motivate the business community to negotiate an alternative approach that would bring more stability to the state.\n\nNewsom had it right during his campaign that \u201cwe need to have a grownup conversation\u201d on tax reform and that \u201ceverything would be on the table,\u201d including Prop. 13, the infamous 1978 property tax-cutting initiative.\n\nMajor tax reform should be his No. 1 priority. It\u2019s the only way the state can both secure its financial future and seriously address other issues plaguing the Golden State.\n\n___\n\nNov. 6\n\nSan Francisco Chronicle on the House that Trump built:\n\nWhile victories in a few key states enabled President Trump\u2019s election two years ago despite a popular-vote defeat, his fellow Republicans couldn\u2019t be saved by the formidable advantages of incumbency, gerrymandering and geographic distribution. It\u2019s a testament to the scope of the Democratic sweep that Republicans could have given up as many as 22 seats \u2014 and lost the overall vote by more than twice as much as Trump did \u2014 and still held on to the House.\n\nThat they didn\u2019t is a powerful rebuke indeed.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s even more substantial advantages in the Senate, where the seats up for election were disproportionately held by Democrats in Trump country, allowed the party to retain a narrow majority in the upper chamber \u2014 though Republicans didn\u2019t even mount an organized challenge to California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who was handily re-elected over a fellow Democrat, former state Senate leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n.\n\nMidterm elections comprise hundreds of state and regional races, but they have increasingly served as a referendum on the presidency, a trend that Trump has only accelerated. The constitutionally coequal legislative branch has been diminished to de facto subservience to the executive over the past two years. Seventy percent of likely voters had Trump foremost in mind, according to a recent CNN poll, and most of them went against Republicans. Though the president can be counted on to dismiss and distance himself from the unfavorable result, he repeatedly told his endless rallies that he was effectively on the ballot.\n\nHe went further, in fact, making the ugly nativism at the core of his politics the particular focus of the last weeks of the campaign \u2014 while downplaying the booming economy, conservative judicial appointments and other issues that many of his fellow Republicans, not least House Speaker Paul Ryan, would have preferred to emphasize. He did so despite a rash of attempted bombings targeting his critics and a synagogue massacre linked to far-right conspiracies about the migrant caravans he relentlessly hyped. The president\u2019s last-ditch paranoid pitch was exemplified by a false, xenophobic campaign ad so outlandish that it was ultimately pulled by Trump-friendly Fox News.\n\nThe nation\u2019s verdict on this grim politics was clear, and it couldn\u2019t have been rendered without California. Democrats found Republican strongholds in the Central Valley and Southern California suddenly within reach. And a pair of veteran California representatives, Bakersfield Republican Kevin McCarthy and San Francisco Democrat Nancy Pelosi, vied to be first in line for the next speakership.\n\nPelosi and her fellow Democrats effectively countered Trump\u2019s all-consuming cult of personality with a disciplined focus on policy. They benefited from the belated popularity of the Affordable Care Act, passed by a majority that Pelosi corralled nearly a decade ago and then promptly lost in the infamous 2010 \u201cshellacking.\u201d The opposition party won\u2019t manage anything nearly that ambitious while Republicans hold the White House and Senate; the Tea Party-fueled House ushered in eight years ago illustrated the pitfalls of trying to run the country with half of Congress.\n\nBut the House can effectively obstruct Trump\u2019s legislative agenda, from weakening the ACA to fortifying the border. Its investigative and oversight powers, meanwhile, will be turned toward the administration and away from its opponents. Instead of helping Trump impede Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe, the new majority will consider whether it justifies impeachment. The president, as a result, may have seen the peak of his power.\n\nMeanwhile, Nancy Pelosi is poised to return to the speakership, a plus for San Francisco and a plus for the concept of checks and balances in Washington.", "", "FILE - In this Jan. 3, 2013, file photo, Rep.

(AP) \u2014 Pennsylvania\u2019s newly elected lieutenant governor said Wednesday he does not plan to move into the lavish state-owned official residence and hopes to make it available for some type of public use.\n\nDemocrat John Fetterman said that he may rent a place in Harrisburg, but that he\u2019s definitely not moving his family to Harrisburg or to the residence at Fort Indiantown Gap.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to reside in the mansion,\u201d Fetterman said during a postelection visit to the Capitol newsroom. \u201cMy wife and I envision, and the governor supports, some kind of public usage of it. Particularly swimming for children.\u201d\n\nHe said his family will remain in Braddock, a western Pennsylvania steel town where he is mayor.\n\n\u201cNot that Harrisburg\u2019s not a wonderful town,\u201d Fetterman said, noting he grew up outside York, about 25 miles from the capital. But he added his family has \u201ca real strong allegiance both practically but also symbolically to the community that I\u2019ve been lucky enough to lead for the past four terms.\u201d\n\nFetterman beat Lt. Gov. Mike Stack, a former state senator, and three others in the Democratic primary this year to become Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf\u2019s running mate.\n\nWolf and Stack were never particularly close, but that was exacerbated last year when the governor stripped Stack of Pennsylvania State Police protection and limited cleaning, groundskeeping and maintenance at the State House, as it is called, after an investigation that wasn\u2019t made public into how state employees were treated there and the use of the state police troopers.\n\nStack\u2019s office later disclosed his wife had entered treatment for an undisclosed mental health issue.\n\nStack spokesman J.P. Kurish said the residence\u2019s location may present a problem for plans to convert it to a more public purpose.\n\n\u201cIt would be difficult, because it sits on a military base,\u201d Kurish said. \u201cSo it\u2019s really not public land.\u201d\n\nThe property includes a couple houses and a pool that was closed at the end of the season for a pump repair, the General Services Department said. The state\u2019s staff and maintenance costs have run about $400,000 a year recently, said agency spokesman Troy Thompson. He said officials will work with Fetterman on the property\u2019s future.\n\nThe staff had once included a cook, a full-time cleaning person, a maintenance worker and a manager, Kurish said. But since Wolf imposed changes, it has consisted of a full-time maintenance worker. The three-story, stone exterior State House comprises about 2,400 square feet.\n\nStack\u2019s future plans remain unclear, he said.\n\n\u201cAs far as I know, he\u2019s still entertaining offers and hasn\u2019t made a decision on that,\u201d Kurish said.\n\nAs lieutenant governor, Fetterman will preside over sessions of the state Senate.\n\nLieutenant governors chair the state Board of Pardons, sit on the emergency management council and typically take a leading role in working with the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency.\n\nWolf has not moved into the governor\u2019s residence along the Susquehanna River in Harrisburg, instead commuting 20 miles to the Capitol from his home in Mount Wolf, a York County borough named for an ancestor.", "WILTON MANORS, Fla.

Scientists say the red silhouette of a bull-like beast, upper left, is the oldest known example of animal art. (Luc-Henri Fage/kalimanthrope.com via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Scientists have found the oldest known example of an animal drawing: a red silhouette of a bull-like beast on the wall of an Indonesian cave.\n\nThe sketch is at least 40,000 years old, slightly older than similar animal paintings found in famous caves in France and Spain. Until a few years ago, experts believed Europe was where our ancestors started drawing animals and other figures.\n\nBut the age of the drawing reported Wednesday in the journal Nature, along with previous discoveries in Southeast Asia, suggest that figurative drawing appeared in both continents about the same time.\n\nThe new findings fuel discussions about whether historical or evolutionary events prompted this near-simultaneous \u201cburst of human creativity,\u201d said lead author Maxime Aubert, an archaeologist and geochemist at Griffith University in Australia.\n\nThe remote limestones caves on Borneo have been known to contain prehistoric drawings since the 1990s. To reach them, Aubert and his team used machetes to hack through thick jungle in a verdant corner of the island.\n\nStrapping on miners\u2019 helmets to illuminate the darkness, they walked and crawled through miles of caves decorated with hundreds of ancient designs, looking for artwork that could be dated. They needed to find specific mineral deposits on the drawings to determine their age with technology that measures decay of the element uranium.\n\n\u201cMost of the paintings we actually can\u2019t sample,\u201d said Aubert.\n\nAubert and his fellow researchers reported in 2014 on cave art from the neighboring Indonesian island of Sulawesi. They dated hand stencils, created by blowing red dye through a tube to capture the outline of a hand pressed against rock, to almost 40,000 years ago.\n\nNow, with the Borneo cave art, the scientists are able to construct a rough timeline of how art developed in the area. In addition to the bull, which is about 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide, they dated red- and purple-colored hand stencils and cave paintings of human scenes.\n\nAfter large animal drawings and stencils, \u201cIt seems the focus shifted to showing the human world,\u201d Aubert said.\n\nAround 14,000 years ago, the cave-dwellers began to regularly sketch human figures doing things like dancing and hunting, often wearing large headdresses. A similar transition in rock art subjects happened in the caves of Europe.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very cool, from a human point of view,\u201d said Peter Veth, an archaeologist at the University of Western Australia, who was not involved in the study. \u201cPeople adopted similar strategies in different environments as they became more modern.\u201d\n\nThe island of Borneo was still connected to mainland Southeast Asia when the first figurative drawings were made about 40,000 years ago \u2014 which is also about the time that the first modern humans arrived in Europe. The earliest drawings of animals in the French cave of Chauvet have been dated to about 33,500 to 37,000 years ago.\n\nWhether new waves of people migrating from Africa brought the skills of figurative cave painting with them, or whether these arts emerged later, remains unclear. Scientists have only a partial record of global rock art. The earliest cave etchings have been found in Africa and include abstract designs, like crosshatches, dating to around 73,000 years ago.\n\nThe next stage of research in Indonesia will include excavations to learn more about the people who made these paintings. A few sites have already been identified, containing human bones, prehistoric jewelry and remains of small animals.\n\nAs for the red bull, its meaning remains a mystery.\n\n\u201cWe think it wasn\u2019t just food for them \u2014 it meant something special,\u201d said Aubert.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Rick Snyder, who is term-limited. She said she would like to meet soon with the next crop of legislative leaders after they are chosen by rank-and-file legislators on Thursday, adding that she intends to \u201cwork very hard\u201d to build and maintain relationships in the Capitol.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what people in Michigan want and expect from us,\u201d said Whitmer, who will become the first governor with legislative experience since John Engler, who served from 1991 through 2002.\n\nDemocrats made electoral gains in the Legislature but not enough to break the GOP\u2019s majorities. They netted five seats in both chambers, narrowing Republicans\u2019 edge to 22-16 in the Senate and 58-52 in the House. The GOP has led the House since 2011 and the Senate since 1984.\n\nSnyder said he looks forward to working with Whitmer and her team to ensure a smooth transition. She planned to announce her transition leaders later Wednesday and said she will put together a diverse Cabinet.\n\n\u201cGovernor-elect Whitmer\u2019s success means Michigan\u2019s success,\u201d Snyder said in a statement. \u201cI urge all Michiganders to join me in committing to a spirit of civility, unity, collaboration and teamwork to ensure Michigan continues on the right path toward our promising future.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow David Eggert on Twitter at https://twitter.com/DavidEggert00 .

If high-capacity helicopters happen to be here and available when a major lightning storm hammers Southern Oregon, that\u2019s good. If those helicopters already have been committed to big fires burning elsewhere, that\u2019s not so good.\n\nSo it only makes sense that local officials should explore ways to procure our own dedicated aircraft, so they\u2019re ready and waiting to be called on to attack fires before they have a chance to grow into conflagrations.\n\nJackson County commissioners are considering spending $2 million to station two Type 1 helicopters here during fire season. Type 1 helicopters are capable of hauling and dropping up to 3,000 gallons of water or retardant at a time. By comparison, Type 2 choppers carry hundreds of gallons.\n\nAs luck and timing would have it, two Type 1 helicopters were standing by at the Ashland airport July 15 after working the Klamathon fire earlier in the month. So when a lightning storm ignited 145 new fires, those aircraft were able to attack many of them right away.\n\nDave Larson, southwest district forester for the Oregon Department of Forestry, says there is no doubt that the presence of those aircraft meant fewer of those fires became big fires, but he wants a detailed study of the past 15 fire seasons before local officials lobby for state funding. It\u2019s possible that one Type 1 helicopter and three Type 2 choppers might be a more effective mix for initial attack.\n\nThat\u2019s a prudent step, but not if it means a delay in seeking funding. The 2019 Legislature convenes Jan. 22, and lawmakers will be adopting the next two-year state budget.\n\nAs a practical matter, $2 million is not a great deal of money, considering ODF spent $60 million fighting fires in this region this year. And it\u2019s a bargain if dedicated aircraft reduce overall firefighting costs by keeping fires small.\n\nThis area\u2019s legislative delegation, which voters are choosing today, should make it a priority to secure state funding. If necessary, the county should put up the money for the first year just to get the aircraft here in time for next summer\u2019s fire season.\n\n___\n\nThe Bend Bulletin, Nov. 5, on not keeping reforms secret:\n\nFortunately for Oregonians, it can be difficult to keep secrets in Salem. Thus, news that state lawmakers might be asked to reduce prisons sentences next year was leaked to The Oregonian, despite Gov. Kate Brown\u2019s attempts to keep the matter secret.\n\nIn fact, Brown asked state agencies to keep their proposals for the 2019 session of the Legislature secret until after the election.\n\nUsually, legislative concepts, as they\u2019re called, are made public by the end of October.\n\nYou may draw your own conclusions about why Brown chose secrecy, but the fact remains: Secrecy and good government do not go hand in hand.\n\nOregon went through a serious round of prison reform in 2013. Lawmakers reduced the sentences for some property crimes, let some low-risk offenders leave prison early and put money into community corrections programs that would deal with some offenders at the county level.\n\nStatewide discussion of the cost of the prison system and ways to contain its growth began at least two years before the 2013 Legislature acted.\n\nThere were newspaper stories about the money required to keep up with prison population growth and how many more prisons would be needed as a result. Others centered on whether the state\u2019s incarceration policies, heavy on keeping offenders out of jail, worked.\n\nWe\u2019ve had almost none of that in 2018, or in 2017. Nor do we know exactly what\u2019s being proposed, or why. We do know some things.\n\nOregon and its counties spend a higher percentage of revenues on corrections than most states, and that\u2019s, in part, because we lock up more juvenile offenders than most states do.\n\nIt may be that Oregon\u2019s corrections system is, again, ripe for reform. If so, Oregonians need to know what\u2019s wrong and why what is being considered will improve the situation. More importantly, we need to be part of any discussion about proposed changes and that discussion needs to begin now, not after the Legislature convenes.\n\n___\n\nCapital Press, Nov. 1, on marketing, big potato truck recipe for success:\n\nLast June 9, as participants in the Rose Festival Parade lined up in downtown Portland, a truck drew most of the attention. It wasn\u2019t just any truck; it was the Big Idaho Potato Truck, a 72-foot-long semi with a 4-ton fiberglass potato on its flatbed.\n\nWelcome to world of marketing. The truck and its big, whopping potato stem from a famous postcard of a giant potato on a truck with the caption, \u201cWe grow \u2019em big here in Idaho.\u201d\n\nAs it turns out, there\u2019s no better way to attract attention than to show up with the Big Idaho Potato Truck staffed by the Tater Team \u2014 Jessica, Kaylee and Ron the driver.\n\nIn the case of the Rose Parade, upwards of 1.2 million people saw the truck, which certainly sparked conversations about, of all things, Idaho potatoes.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the point.\n\nRaising public awareness of a crop isn\u2019t easy. Once you get beyond the basics \u2014 \u201cPotatoes are good for you,\u201d \u2033Potatoes taste good,\u201d \u2033Potatoes are versatile\u201d \u2014 you have to do something to keep up the conversation.\n\nThat\u2019s where marketing comes in. The Big Idaho Potato Truck is just one part of the toolkit the Idaho Potato Commission has developed to get the Idaho Potato brand in front of the public. The commission sponsors a college football bowl game, buys national advertising, does promotions and uses dozens of other tools to promote the state\u2019s potatoes. Processors are even adopting the Idaho brand as part of their advertising and labeling.\n\nWhile some may call it into question as an added expense, marketing, done right, makes money. The biggest brands in the nation use it. Banks, consumer goods manufacturers, car makers, retailers all use marketing as their game plan to raise the public\u2019s awareness of their products and services and to set themselves apart from the crowd.\n\nAnd it\u2019s hard to argue with success. During the last 15 years the farm-gate revenue from Idaho potatoes is up more than 80 percent. Not bad. Considering the alternative \u2014 selling a straight commodity \u2014 marketing has done a good job for Idaho potato growers.\n\n\u201cThere is more brand recognition for Idaho potatoes than for almost anything in the country,\u201d Potato Growers of Idaho Executive Director Keith Esplin told Capital Press reporter Brad Carlson. \u201cIf they would quit that, in a few years potatoes would be a generic product.\u201d\n\nThe Idaho Potato Commission and its president and CEO, Frank Muir, brought the marketing campaign to life. Starting 15 years ago, they recognized the need to make Idaho potatoes stand out from other crops and cause consumers to seek out Idaho potatoes.\n\n\u201cWere these potatoes grown in Idaho? That is what we want people to ask,\u201d Muir said.\n\nOther crops and agricultural products also market themselves \u2014 think Tillamook cheese, Washington apples, Walla Walla onions, Hermiston watermelons, California milk, among many others.

(AP Photo/Bill Feig)\n\nThe Rams and Saints again showed the value of stacking lineups in daily fantasy football contests as they erupted Sunday for 80 total points and more than 280 fantasy points in point-per-reception leagues.\n\nDrew Brees, Michael Thomas, Alvin Kamara, Jared Goff, Brandin Cooks and Cooper Kupp all cracked the 20-point threshold and a few savvy owners were able to fit in combinations of these players into their lineups.\n\nWith a high anticipated game total a lot of the ownership went to Todd Gurley (26 percent owned) and Goff (17 percent owned) leaving much lower ownership on Brees (6 percent owned) in daily tournaments. With a back and forth game, it ended up being Brees stacked with Thomas and Kamara vaulting DFS players up the leaderboards.\n\nGame stacking is important but equally important is trying to find ways to identify low ownership in games with high expected totals, allowing you to separate yourself from the field. Brees out-produced Goff at the same price and lower ownership, which provided the separation necessary to win. This week, there are a few spots where high potential upside can be found at reduced ownership or pricing.\n\nCHIEFS-CARDINALS\n\nKansas City has the highest implied team total on the slate with 33 points expected at home against the Arizona Cardinals. The Chiefs are averaging 36.3 points per game on the season and rank within the top 5 in the NFL in both total offense and passing yards per game. Patrick Mahomes has carried only modest ownership (10 percent) in DFS contests and has been producing the most lately when paired with RB Kareem Hunt and TE Travis Kelce, who now has double digit fantasy points in every game since Week 1.\n\nWith so much emphasis in the fantasy community on recent results, fantasy owners are likely to overlook Tyreek Hill, who was just 5 percent owned in DFS contests last week compared to 30 percent ownership on Hunt and 17 percent on Kelce. DailyRoto\u2019s DFS ownership projections expect that to continue and it leaves Hill as a contrarian tournament target who has double digit fantasy performances in eight of nine weeks this season and two 40-plus point games. Pairing up Mahomes with Hill offers high upside and lower ownership this week.\n\nSAINTS-BENGALS\n\nNew Orleans also has a high team total this week and Brees, Thomas and Kamara will be popular plays after going off in the last game. While their projections will be strong again this week, DailyRoto projections suggest that pivoting to RB Mark Ingram can save salary and be a contrarian tournament target. Ingram\u2019s $6,800 FanDuel price and $4,500 DraftKings price are among the lowest they have been over the last four seasons.\n\nSince his return in Week 5, Ingram has still played on roughly 50 percent of the Saints offensive snaps, receiving an average of 12.5 carries and 2.5 targets per game. This role is comparable to his role down the stretch in the 2017 offense that saw Ingram put up 15-plus fantasy points in five separate games from Week 10 through the end of the regular season.\n\nThe biggest concern for Ingram isn\u2019t Kamara but perhaps Taysom Hill\u2019s role in the red zone, where he has seen nine opportunities and can eat into some of Ingram\u2019s goal line work. Despite this, Ingram projects as a solid RB value this week and one that should be low owned. In additional to providing leverage against popular Saints players, Ingram also is the same price as RB Dion Lewis, who DailyRoto projects as one of the highest owned players on the slate.\n\n___\n\nFor more in-depth daily fantasy insights and tools, visit DailyRoto: https://dailyroto.com", "", "Sherri Jasper, a Girl Scout board member and counselor at Halmstad Elementary School, leads the program for a candlelight vigil at the school in Chippewa Falls, Wis., Sunday evening, Nov. 4, 2018.

(AP) \u2014 A day after securing enough votes to become Tennessee\u2019s next governor, Republican Bill Lee says he will soon reveal his top policy proposals and cabinet selections as he transitions into the office.\n\nThe governor-elect had previously held off answering questions on direct policy positions along the campaign trail, arguing he had an election to win first before diving into specifics.\n\nOn Wednesday, Lee joined term-limited Gov. Bill Haslam in the Tennessee Capitol to celebrate the election win in front of a cheering crowd made up of lawmakers and Republican officials. During the event, Lee announced he would be taking a little time before giving an outline of what the businessman\u2019s agenda will look like in the upcoming months.\n\nWhen asked specifically on how he would approach key cabinet appointments, such as education commissioner, Lee said his team was still developing a strategy. The night before, Lee had told reporters he was open to appointing Democrats to his administration.\n\n\u201cI worked really hard to stay focused on the election to be honest with you, and we have not begun the process, but we are actually beginning it today,\u201d Lee said. \u201cOur team will start to sit down and talk about specifics about transition.\u201d\n\nWhen Haslam was elected in 2010, he conducted a nationwide search to find the right person to lead Tennessee\u2019s Department of Education. Haslam also announced who would be leading his transition team and the head of his inauguration team a week after winning the election.\n\n\u201cI can remember standing here with Gov. (Phil Bredesen), doing this eight years ago as vividly as it was yesterday,\u201d Haslam said. \u201cYou\u2019ve spent the better part of two years running for this position and you realize there\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAlong with an education commissioner, Lee is in charge of appointing more than 20 people to lead agencies ranging from agriculture to health care. However, Lee could also push to cut certain agencies \u2014 an option that gained interest when Lee pointed to other states that had many fewer agencies than Tennessee.\n\n\u201cRunning an efficient government is very important; we\u2019ll begin looking at opportunities to do that as well,\u201d Lee said, adding he hadn\u2019t made any immediate plans to reduce any particular agency.\n\nLee won Tuesday\u2019s election against former Democratic Nashville Mayor Karl Dean by a nearly 20-point margin.\n\nIt was the first time Lee, owner of a $225 million mechanical contracting, facilities and home services company with more than 1,200 employees, had ever run for political office.\n\nSince he first announced his bid to replace Haslam, Lee has positioned himself as a political outsider that Tennessee needs to bring the state from \u201cgood to great.\u201d However, that stance also comes with questions on how he\u2019ll govern.\n\nLee has said his priorities starting off will be economic development for rural communities, criminal justice reforms that will create safer neighborhoods, and education reform, with a focus on vocational and technical education. No specific policies were released Wednesday on those topics.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s still unknown how Lee will handle the contracts his company has with local governments.\n\nAccording to a public records review by The Associated Press, the Lee Company does not have any current contracts with the state after choosing not to renew a sweeping electrical, HVAC and plumbing deal at the end of the August.\n\nYet, the company still contracts with local cities and counties \u2014 a situation that sparked questions among some attorneys and ethics experts about the possible legal logistics of a governor\u2019s private business contracting with governments.\n\nLee had said he would stop all state contracts if elected governor, but he has yet to address what he will do the local contracts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re set to meet just this week on specifics and on how to structure the company in a way that\u2019s clear and transparent but that also provides for no conflicts of interest,\u201d he said.", "MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) \u2014 Democrats and their allies in the Vermont Legislature made gains in Tuesday\u2019s elections, and are claiming a veto-proof majority in both the House and Senate that could make it easier for them to pass liberal legislation that has been vetoed by Republican Gov. Phil Scott.\n\nPreliminary results from Tuesday\u2019s voting show that Democrats and their Progressive Party allies appear have reached a veto-proof majority in the House, winning at least 100 seats, with the Republicans holding 43. The Republicans are expected to hold six seats in the 30-member state Senate.\n\nIn the current House, the GOP holds 51 seats in the 150-seat chamber. A veto override requires two-thirds of each chamber, or 100 in the House and 20 in the Senate.\n\n\u201cIn legislative races, there was a blue wave all over the state,\u201d retired Middlebury College Political Science Professor Eric Davis said Wednesday.\n\nHe called the convincing re-election win of Republican Gov. Phil Scott a personal victory for the governor, not for the GOP.\n\n\u201cThe House Republican party is smaller, more conservative and sort of more in its bastions of northern Vermont and Rutland County and that\u2019s not a formula for winning statewide,\u201d said Davis, who has been following Vermont politics since 1980.\n\nWhile Scott shares the goal of helping Vermonters succeed, he has committed himself to ensuring that people and businesses aren\u2019t burdened by increased taxes or fees or what he feels are business-restricting state mandates, said his spokeswoman Rebecca Kelley said Wednesday.\n\nThe governor, she said, recognizes that he will be less able to wield his veto pen, or the threat of a veto, to shape policy that will come out of the Statehouse after lawmakers return in January for the 2019 session.\n\n\u201cThe dynamic has absolutely changed,\u201d she said. \u201cThe governor recognizes that, and we will be looking to find common ground.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s focus in the upcoming session will remain what it has always been, she said, including economic issues and Vermont\u2019s demographic challenge.\n\nDuring the 2018 session, Scott issued 11 vetoes, including bills that addressed key Democratic priorities, such as increasing over time the minimum wage to $15 per hour and paid family leave. Scott said he felt those pieces of legislation would have placed too great a burden on Vermont\u2019s job-creating small businesses.\n\nSix of the vetoed bills were eventually passed in some form, Kelley said.\n\nIn a victory speech Tuesday night, Democratic Vermont House speaker Mitzi Johnson said Scott\u2019s vetoes made it harder for Vermonters to succeed and she said the results of the vote showed Vermonters want to change that.\n\n\u201cTonight Vermonters said, \u2018That\u2019s not what we want, you need to listen,\u2019\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe need to make sure to include everyone and raise all boats.\u201d\n\nEven with the increased presence in the House, Davis said he didn\u2019t think Democrats would vote along party lines in all cases.\n\n\u201cObviously, the veto is not going to be as effective a tool,\u201d he said.\n\nDavis said he expects that once lawmakers are back in session, they will hold \u201ca test of strength\u201d between the newly empowered Legislature and the governor.\n\nHe feels lawmakers could bring back the minimum wage bill vetoed by Scott in May, he said. The bill would have raised the minimum wage to $15 by 2024, perhaps modifying it before passing it again.\n\n\u201cI think they will want to test, both their own caucus and the governor\u2019s ability to use the veto early in the session,\u201d Davis said.", "URBANA, Ill.

For the sake of comparison, the Water Utility\u2019s daily draw in 2016, before Foxconn was even on Racine County\u2019s radar, was 16.9 million gallons per day.\n\nThe Midwest Environmental Advocates organization quickly challenged the DNR\u2019s decision, saying the decision goes against The Great Lakes Compact.\n\nThe Compact, a 2008 agreement intended to safeguard the Great Lakes, stated that a water diversion for a lakefront community like Mount Pleasant must largely serve residential customers \u2014 something the MEA and other environmental groups are taking issue with.\n\nIn a news release, the DNR said that Racine\u2019s requested 7 million gallons per day withdrawal would only amount to a 0.07 percent increase in the total surface water withdrawals from Lake Michigan. The news release also stated that Foxconn will need to work with the City of Racine to meet pretreatment requirements for wastewater.\n\nShortly after the MEA filed a legal action, Foxconn officials said they had plans to install a $30 million zero-liquid discharge system in order to reduce the facility\u2019s water intake requirements. A ZLD system is a wastewater treatment process which has as its goal to reduce the volume of wastewater that requires further treatment, economically process wastewater and produce a clean stream suitable for reuse. The system \u201cwill go beyond any local, state and federal requirements relating to industrial water discharge,\u201d Foxconn told TheVerge.com, a Vox Media website, in an Oct. 29 report.\n\nWe appreciate the commitments Foxconn has made with regard to handling Lake Michigan water with care. But we also want both government and private groups to maintain vigilance in holding Foxconn to those commitments.\n\nBecause Foxconn will be withdrawing and returning from the lake, and that\u2019s where we get our drinking water.\n\n___\n\nKenosha News, Nov. 3\n\nA welcome embrace of Mexican culture in Kenosha\n\nLast weekend, the Kenosha Public Museum held its second annual Dia de los Muertos: Day of the Dead celebration.\n\nAnd the event was quite a sight to behold.\n\nFrom the demos of the members of the Ballerina Folklorico Regional Mexicano, to the ofrendas, or items set out on ritual displays, that greeted attendees as they walked through the front doors, the Oct. 27 event at the museum was a wonderful and welcome embrace of Mexican culture here in Kenosha.\n\nWith the rhetoric that we hear over radios and on TV screens, it is encouraging that a Kenosha entity would offer such a big platform to inform local residents about the culture of another community.\n\nBeyond simply the embrace of another culture, the most surprising \u2014 and incredible \u2014 aspect of the event was the large and crucial involvement of the students of Bradford High School\u2019s Spanish for Spanish Speakers classes.\n\nThese students not only spent weeks in the classroom learning about Dia de los Muertos and traveled to the National Museum of Mexican Art in Chicago to do a workshop on it, but they also handcrafted the ofrendas that were on display for the event and served as volunteers for each part of the event \u2014 alongside museum staff and museum volunteers.\n\nWe thank the Bradford students and the museum for coming together for this event and for all of their efforts in expanding the Kenosha community\u2019s knowledge of cultures other than our own.\n\nWe hope that those in attendance not only left with the knowledge of the capabilities of the young people in our community, but also with a new appreciation for Mexican customs, folklore and traditions.", "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Pacific Gas and Electric Company is notifying customers in nine Northern California counties it may turn off power starting Thursday to reduce the risk of a wildfire amid hot and windy weather.\n\nPG&E says the planned outages would affect portions of Butte, Lake, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Sierra, Sonoma and Yuba counties.\n\nThe National Weather Service says warm temperatures, low humidity, and strong winds are forecast for those areas from Wednesday night to Friday morning.\n\nPG&E says the notices to about 70,000 customers are being sent via automated voice, text messages and emails.\n\nIt says it will turn off power as a last resort.\n\nThe utility says is working closely with first responders and local authorities and keeping them informed on its response to the warming weather.", "Martin Truex Jr., greets fans during driver introductions prior to the start of the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race at Martinsville Speedway in Martinsville, Va., Sunday, Oct. 28, 2018. (AP Photo/Steve Helber)\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 NASCAR champion Martin Truex Jr. and his crew chief will move to Joe Gibbs Racing next season to remain in the Toyota organization after their race team folds in two weeks.\n\nTruex won his first Cup title last year driving for Furniture Row Racing. Barney Visser had funded the team out of pocket for most of its existence but received relief help the last few seasons from sponsorship.\n\nWhen the primary sponsor of the No. 78 decided to leave NASCAR and Visser couldn\u2019t find a replacement, the owner decided to close because he found it too expensive to field a championship-contending team without outside funding.\n\nTruex will replace Daniel Suarez as driver of the No. 19 team. Sponsorship was not announced.\n\n\u201cAnytime you have an opportunity to bring two people of this caliber into your organization, it\u2019s certainly an exciting time,\u201d said team owner Joe Gibbs. \u201cThey obviously have developed a chemistry that has led to tremendous success, including a championship. We\u2019ve gotten to know them well over the past few years through the alliance and having been part of the Toyota family. They both make us stronger as an organization.\u201d\n\nTruex has 19 Cup victories, including a career-high eight victories in last year\u2019s championship season. A member of the so-called Big Three that dominated NASCAR this season, Truex has four victories and goes to Phoenix this weekend in contention for a spot in the championship race. Only one of the three slots for the finale has been filled, and Truex is above the cutline to qualify for Homestead-Miami Speedway and a shot at defending his title.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited to have the opportunity to join Joe Gibbs Racing,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously to be able to make this transition and still be able to work alongside Cole (Pearn) is something that was very important to me. There is also a real comfort level working with the JGR team and I wanted to stay in the Toyota family.\n\n\u201cWe still have big goals for the remainder of this season, but it\u2019s nice to know what we will be doing in 2019.\u201d\n\nPearn was promoted from lead engineer to crew chief for the No. 78 team in 2015 and has guided the team to 17 wins.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of everything we\u2019ve been able to accomplish over the past few years out of Denver and the move to JGR will make the transition for 2019 an easy one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great organization with a lot of great people and a leadership team that wants to win.\u201d\n\nSuarez, meanwhile, is looking for a new job. The Mexican won the 2016 Xfinity Series title driving for Gibbs and two months later was unexpectedly promoted to the Cup Series when Carl Edwards walked away from NASCAR.\n\nEdwards\u2019 retirement put Toyota\u2019s long-term development plan in flux. Suarez had been expected to succeed Erik Jones at Furniture Row, where he\u2019d been stashed by Gibbs in 2017 and was supposed to remain until a Gibbs seat opened. Then Suarez was expected to move into the second Furniture Row car while he waited for a Gibbs seat.\n\nInstead, Gibbs had to bring Suarez up early while Jones drove last season as Truex\u2019s teammate. Gibbs brought Jones in-house this season, but there was no room remaining for Suarez once Visser put his plans in motion.\n\nSuarez has 21 top-10 finishes and one pole in two seasons with JGR. He\u2019s currently ranked 20th in the Cup standings, the same place he finished last year.\n\n\u201cWe really appreciate everything Daniel has done for Joe Gibbs Racing over these past several years,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cHe has made the most of every opportunity from winning the championship in the Xfinity Series to making the jump into the Cup Series for us. We look forward to hearing about his plans going forward and know he continues to have a bright future in our sport.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "The Latest: Ballot collection to begin for historic tally\n\nDemocrat Jared Golden, left, joined by wife Isobel, right, speaks to supporters as they wait for results in the 2nd Congressional District election, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Lewiston, Maine.

( Melissa Phillip/Houston Chronicle via AP, Pool, File)\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 The husband of a former sheriff\u2019s deputy was sentenced to 25 years in prison on Wednesday for the strangulation death of a man the couple confronted outside a Houston-area restaurant.\n\nProsecutors argued Terry Thompson wanted to kill 24-year-old John Hernandez and kept him in a chokehold even when he stopped resisting after Thompson confronted Hernandez about urinating in the parking lot of a Denny\u2019s restaurant in May 2017.\n\nThompson\u2019s attorney countered he was only defending himself after being punched and kept Hernandez subdued only until he stopped resisting.\n\nJurors denied a request by Thompson\u2019s attorney to find that he acted with sudden passion and was unable to control his anger \u2014 which would have made him eligible for a lesser sentence of two years to 20 years. The same jury, which deliberated his sentence for about seven hours on Wednesday, had convicted Thompson of murder on Monday.\n\nThompson\u2019s wife, former Harris County sheriff\u2019s deputy Chauna Thompson, arrived later at the restaurant and helped subdue Hernandez. Chauna Thompson, who was off duty at the time and was later fired, faces a murder trial in April.\n\nHarris County District Attorney Kim Ogg called Thompson\u2019s sentence appropriate and said she hoped the case would deter people from resorting to violence to resolve their conflicts.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of ways of dealing with one another civilly. That\u2019s what I think our country\u2019s been saying in so many ways as of recent times,\u201d Ogg said. \u201cThis is just another lesson that things are never resolved successfully through violence \u2014 never.\u201d\n\nThompson\u2019s family, including his wife, declined to comment after the jury\u2019s verdict.\n\nScot Courtney, Thompson\u2019s attorney, said he was disappointed by the sentence.\n\nDuring a victim impact statement after the verdict was announced, Maria Toral, Hernandez\u2019s wife, told Thompson that she didn\u2019t want to live her life hating him.\n\n\u201cBut if you repent for what you did, I will forgive you,\u201d Toral said as she stared at Thompson, who remained silent.\n\nOutside the courtroom, Ignacio Hernandez, the victim\u2019s father, said he would have wanted a longer sentence for Thompson but he accepted the jury\u2019s decision. Prosecutors had asked for a life sentence.\n\nDuring closing arguments in the trial\u2019s punishment phase earlier Wednesday, Courtney asked jurors for a sentence that would allow his client to one day return to his family. He described Thompson as someone who was friendly, hardworking and dedicated to his children.\n\n\u201cTerry Thompson is a good man. Did he make a bad decision and a bad mistake? There is no question of that,\u201d Courtney said.\n\nBut prosecutor John Jordan told jurors Thompson didn\u2019t deserve their mercy as he had a history of losing his temper and assaulting his children.\n\nJordan said there was no sudden passion in Thompson\u2019s actions, as he confronted Hernandez for 14 minutes, including keeping him in a chokehold for more than three minutes, even after Hernandez had signaled that he was no longer resisting.\n\n\u201cWhat mercy did he have when his own wife got to the scene and said, \u2018Get off (Hernandez)\u2019?\u201d Jordan said. \u201cHow in the world can you give him what he was not willing to give to another human being?\u201d\n\nHernandez died at a hospital three days after the confrontation.

Ballots are still being counted, and Abrams\u2019 campaign thinks she may have enough for a runoff. Kemp\u2019s campaign declared victory Wednesday night. The Associated Press has not called the contest.\n\nMultiple lawsuits have been filed in the contentious race, with voting rights groups contending that Kemp has used his office to interfere in the election for his own benefit. He has fiercely denied any impropriety.\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday, President Donald Trump said he heard the voting process was \u201cvery efficient\u201d in Georgia. But polling places across the state had long lines, and some areas of metro Atlanta that typically lean Democratic experienced problems and delays.\n\nOntaria Woods arrived at a polling place in Snellville, just northeast of Atlanta, about 7 a.m. Tuesday to vote. More than three hours later, she was still waiting, with roughly 75 to 100 people in line.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the majority of people in this line, African-Americans,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re begging them, \u2018Please, stay.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith votes approaching 3.8 million, Kemp has just more than 50 percent of the vote, which would give him the majority threshold required for victory. But Abrams and her campaign say they believe there are enough ballots still uncounted to force a runoff. To do that, Abrams needs to pick up about 15,000 votes among an unknown number of ballots across the state, her campaign officials said Wednesday.\n\nSome of the longest lines on Election Day formed at polling places near historically black colleges in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of college students over there, and they like to vote out of precinct,\u201d said Richard Barron, director of registration and elections in Fulton County, which includes most of Atlanta.\n\n\u201cWhen you vote out of your precinct, you have to vote a provisional ballot,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd provisional ballots create lines because they take longer to process.\u201d\n\nA court ordered extended voting hours in two polling sites near the colleges. The last voter from those sites cast a ballot about 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, Barron said.\n\nThe state elections chief wasn\u2019t immune to the difficulties: When Kemp went to cast his ballot, he had an issue with his voter card, but it was fixed quickly.\n\nThe same or similar problem affected voters in four large precincts in Gwinnett County\u2014 a populous swing county \u2014 and at least one in the Inman Park neighborhood of Atlanta, election security expert Harri Hursti said Wednesday. Voters in those places were not able to vote for hours because the electronic poll books used to check in voters were not writing to the smart cards needed to cast ballots, Hursti said.\n\n\u201cWhen those machines are down, it eliminates the possibility of voting with the touch screens,\u201d said Joe Sorenson, a Gwinnett County spokesman.\n\nIn Snellville, some machines poll workers use to check in voters didn\u2019t have power cords and ran out of batteries. Paper ballots were handed out for about 15 minutes before the issue was resolved.\n\n\u201cIt was a human error issue,\u201d Sorenson said. \u201cA person who packed that machine didn\u2019t pack it properly, and the person who set it up should have noticed it.\u201d\n\nFulton County\u2019s Barron said that although Kemp is secretary of state, \u201che doesn\u2019t have any say in county operations.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people see things on social media or they are really quick to assign nefarious intentions to people, especially like my staff who are just dedicated public servants,\u201d he said. \u201cThey assign these intentions or motivations to them that couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. I think it\u2019s unfortunate that the distrust in government has reached a point that it has.\u201d\n\nGeorgia is one of only five states that exclusively uses electronic voting machines that computer scientists have long criticized as untrustworthy because they are easily hacked and don\u2019t leave a paper trail. A federal judge in September scolded elections officials for not heeding experts\u2019 warnings and continuing to use the aging machines.\n\nFive Georgia voters sued Kemp on Election Day, asking a judge to prevent Kemp from exercising his duties as the state\u2019s top elections official for anything having to do with Tuesday\u2019s election, including certifying results or administering any possible runoff or recount. The lawsuit says that Kemp presiding over an election in which he is a candidate \u201cviolates a basic notion of fairness.\u201d\n\nSecretary of state\u2019s office spokeswoman Candice Broce called the lawsuit a \u201ctwelfth-hour stunt.\u201d\n\nA federal judge set a hearing for Thursday.\n\nSeparately, Common Cause Georgia filed a lawsuit Monday seeking special treatment of some provisional ballots. It accuses Kemp of acting recklessly after a vulnerability in Georgia\u2019s voter registration database was exposed shortly before the election.\n\nKemp \u201chas not only failed to remedy the problem, but he has advertised the vulnerability of the system to those who may want to interfere\u201d with voting, the lawsuit said.\n\nKemp\u2019s actions increased the risk that eligible voters could be illegally removed from the voter registration database or have registration information illegally altered, which could prevent them from voting, the lawsuit says.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Frank Bajak in Boston and Ron Harris in Atlanta contributed.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Ex-inmate says he lost penis to cancer undiagnosed in jail\n\nBURGAW, N.C.

The Panthers face the Steelers on Thursday in Pittsburgh. (AP Photo/Nell Redmond, File)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Cam Newton spent a portion of the summer studying Ben Roethlisberger and working out alongside Antonio Brown, something the Carolina Panthers quarterback did out of a mix of curiosity and respect.\n\nNewton found himself enamored of Roethlisberger\u2019s footwork \u2014 \u201cThe play is never over for Big Ben\u201d \u2014 and Brown\u2019s relentlessness.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s literally like a nocturnal beast,\u201d Newton said of Brown. \u201cI thought I was bad. ... We had late workouts. I\u2019m talking like 10 p.m-.ish. It was like our second or third one of the day. Whenever he feels the urge to work, he works and I respect it.\u201d\n\nNewton will get an up-close look at Roethlisberger, Brown and the rest of the Steelers (5-2-1) when the Panthers (6-2) make a rare trip to Pittsburgh. Maybe it\u2019s the workouts with Brown. Maybe it\u2019s the rapport he\u2019s developed with offensive coordinator Norv Turner. Maybe it\u2019s the emergence of running back Christian McCaffrey. Whatever it is, Newton is in the midst of his finest season since winning league MVP in 2015.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why Roethlisberger just laughed when asked if there\u2019s any wisdom he might pass along to Newton.\n\n\u201cI do not need to give him advice,\u201d Roethlisberger said. \u201cHe\u2019s Superman.\u201d\n\nA Man of Steel who could be a handful for a resilient Pittsburgh defense. The Steelers were a hot mess during the first month of the season but have figured out things during their four-game winning streak. Pittsburgh is allowing just 275.5 yards per game over the last month. That\u2019s from a combination of the rapid cohesion of a revamped secondary and spending less time on the field thanks to an offense starting to hog the ball behind second-year running back James Conner.\n\nStill, the Panthers present their own unique challenge. Carolina might be the NFL\u2019s closest approximation to a throwback. The Panthers have run for at least 121 yards in seven of eight games, with Newton serving as the catalyst. At 29 he\u2019s on pace for a career high in rushing attempts, a mixture of Turner\u2019s creative play calling and Newton\u2019s pragmatic approach to when he tucks the ball and takes off. While he\u2019s still happy to deliver a shot now and then, he\u2019s more likely to slide before getting hit.\n\nPittsburgh, fourth in the league in sacks, is determined to make sure Newton doesn\u2019t get loose.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way he can duck 10 bullets,\u201d Steelers defensive tackle Cam Heyward said. \u201cIf everybody is shooting their shot, someone is bound to hit. That\u2019s got to be group effort. ... It\u2019s a heck of a test.\u201d\n\nSome things to watch for as Pittsburgh looks to extend its hot streak while Carolina searches for the franchise\u2019s first win in the Steel City:\n\nLE\u2019VEON WHO?\n\nWayward Steelers running back Le\u2019Veon Bell is nearing the end of his months-long standoff with the club. He has until Nov. 13 to report and sign his one-year franchise tender if he wants to make sure he accrues the service time necessary to hit the open market next spring. After some initial angst, Bell\u2019s teammates have moved on. Conner is thriving in Bell\u2019s absence. He\u2019s second in the league in total yards and is the first player in team history to have 10 total touchdowns through eight games.\n\n\u201cJames Conner has been rolling and bulldozing people,\u201d Brown said.\n\nGIMME THAT\n\nCarolina is winning the turnover battle. The Panthers have been even or positive in turnovers in seven of eight games and are 6-1 in those games. They are 5-0 when winning the turnover battle outright.\n\nCarolina is fourth in the league in turnover differential with a plus-8, sixth in points off turnovers (51), seventh in total takeaways (15), and tied for fourth in interceptions (11) behind speedy rookie cornerback Donte Jackson, who has four picks.\n\nSince 2015, Carolina leads the NFL with 102 takeaways and is second with 62 interceptions.\n\nFEISTY FEILER\n\nPittsburgh right tackle Matt Feiler will likely make his third straight start in place of injured Marcus Gilbert. An undrafted free agent, Feiler is thriving while opening up holes for Conner and helping keep Roethlisberger clean. Roethlisberger has been sacked twice during Pittsburgh\u2019s winning streak. Feiler\u2019s success isn\u2019t exactly unprecedented. Three members of Pittsburgh\u2019s current starting offensive line \u2014 Feiler, left guard Ramon Foster and left tackle Alejandro Villanueva \u2014 all went undrafted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s how we\u2019re built,\u201d Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said. \u201cIt\u2019s what we expect, and (Feiler) is just the latest example of a guy that is meeting that expectation like we talked about. He\u2019s capable, so it\u2019s understandable to expect those types of performances from him.\u201d\n\nSTOPPING ADDISON\n\nFuture Hall of Famer Julius Peppers may have more name power, but Mario Addison has been the more productive defensive end for Carolina. Addison leads the team with 7 \u00bd sacks, including a sack trifecta last week against Tampa Bay.\n\nOver the past 38 games, Addison has 28 sacks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a pretty strong guy,\u201d said the 6-foor-3, 260-pound Addison. \u201cPeople underestimate me because I look kind of small, but I pack a punch. By the time they miss and my hands get on the inside of them, I\u2019m running them back and they\u2019re like \u2018Dang, this guy\u2019s stronger than I thought.\u2019\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Steve Reed contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "LARAMIE, Wyo.

Kentucky follows that up by hosting Middle Tennessee and visiting Louisville.\n\n\u201cWe have to be motivated the same way again this week, and each and every week,\u201d Kentucky coach Mark Stoops said. \u201cThat gets to be the challenge as you get through the grind of the season. You get late in the year here, sometimes that monotony sets in, and we can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d\n\nANOTHER TEXAS A&M NOSEDIVE?\n\nOne reason Texas A&M fired coach Kevin Sumlin after last season was the Aggies always seemed to fall apart in November.\n\nTurns out the new coach might have the same problem.\n\nFirst-year coach Jimbo Fisher and the Aggies (5-4, 3-3) are trying to bounce back from a two-game losing skid when they host Ole Miss on Saturday.\n\n\u201cLearning to win is a learned behavior,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cLearning to dominate a game is a learned behavior. And we have to put ourselves in those experiences as much as we possibly can to understand how to do that.\u201d\n\nTENNESSEE, VANDERBILT BOWL ELGIBLITY\n\nAfter going winless in SEC competition last year, Tennessee (4-5, 1-4) has a chance to become bowl eligible in Jeremy Pruitt\u2019s debut season as coach. The Vols must win two of their last three games \u2014 they host Kentucky and Missouri the next two weeks before visiting Vanderbilt.\n\n\u201cWe worked really hard this offseason just trying to make changes from where we made mistakes last year,\u201d Tennessee linebacker Darrin Kirkland Jr. said. \u201cIt was definitely disappointing being at home last year during the Christmas and bowl season. We\u2019ve definitely worked really hard to get back on that stage.\u201d\n\nVanderbilt (4-5, 1-4) has similar hopes and travels to Missouri this week before hosting Ole Miss and Tennessee. Don\u2019t be surprised if a bowl bid is at stake Nov. 24 when Vanderbilt hosts Tennessee to end the regular season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s November,\u201d Vanderbilt coach Derek Mason said. \u201cIt\u2019s winning time.\u201d\n\nARKANSAS\u2019 LAST CHANCES\n\nIt\u2019s been a rough season for Arkansas and first-year coach Chad Morris, which could finish with a winless SEC record for the first time since 2013.\n\nThe Razorbacks (2-7, 0-5) have been competitive in several league games, especially against Texas A&M and Ole Miss. But their schedule down the stretch is not easy: They host No. 9 LSU on Saturday before travelling to face No. 18 Mississippi State and Missouri in the final two games.\n\nDREW LOCK MOVING UP CHARTS\n\nLock has 11,089 career yards passing to rank sixth in SEC history. Lock has no shot at breaking former Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray\u2019s SEC record of 13,166, but the Missouri senior should get to second place on the list.\n\nLock has three more regular-season games plus the possibility of a bowl game. Ranking second on the SEC\u2019s career passing yardage list is David Greene, who threw for 11,528 yards at Georgia from 2001-04.\n\nAUBURN\u2019S FINISH\n\nAuburn\u2019s started the season as a top 10 team, but losses to LSU, Mississippi State and Tennessee sent the program tumbling completely out of the SEC title race.\n\nThe Tigers (6-3, 3-3, No. 24 CFP) have bounced back with recent wins over Ole Miss and Texas A&M and have a chance to get some even bigger wins when they face Georgia (on Saturday) and Alabama (Nov. 24).\n\nAuburn beat both teams last season before losing to Georgia in a rematch in the SEC championship game.\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA GOING FOR TWO\n\nSouth Carolina (5-3, 4-3) must win at Florida this week to post winning SEC records in back-to-back seasons for just the fourth time since entering the league in 1992. Gamecocks quarterback Jake Bentley says Muschamp has pointed that out to South Carolina\u2019s players.\u2032\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of pride,\u201d Bentley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve played this game since we were five years old and no one likes to lose. It\u2019s about just taking a stand and doing whatever it takes to get wins. That\u2019s what this team\u2019s mindset has switched to. Not worrying about what happened and just take each game as a season at a time.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Teresa Walker and Pete Iacobelli contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 .", "Detroit Pistons forward Stanley Johnson (7) reaches for the ball after a dunk by Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade during the second half of an NBA basketball game, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, in Detroit.

(AP) \u2014 Voters in nearly three-quarters of Louisiana\u2019s parishes agreed to legalize online fantasy sports contests for cash prizes, setting in motion a process that could see people in the state playing the games by late 2019.\n\nForty-seven of Louisiana\u2019s 64 parishes supported the ballot measure in Tuesday\u2019s election, making Louisiana the 42nd state to allow online fantasy sports betting. The 17 parishes that rejected the idea are primarily in rural pockets of north Louisiana.\n\nWith websites such as DraftKings and FanDuel, people create imaginary teams of real-life sports players and score points based on how those players perform in actual games. The sites charge an entry fee and offer payouts to winners.\n\nVOTERS DECIDE\n\nLawmakers and Gov. John Bel Edwards agreed to let voters decide on a parish-by-parish basis whether to legalize the cash-league fantasy sports contests. Backers said the games are fun and people should be able to make their own decisions about participating.\n\nSupport was strongest in the New Orleans area. In Orleans Parish, 73 percent of those who voted backed the fantasy sports proposal, according to unaudited returns from the secretary of state\u2019s office. In neighboring parishes, the measure won 71 percent of the vote in St. Bernard, 69 percent in Jefferson, 67 percent in Plaquemines and 62 percent in St. Tammany.\n\nParishes containing all of Louisiana\u2019s major cities backed the idea, including Caddo, Calcasieu, East Baton Rouge, Lafayette, Ouachita and Rapides. In a few places, backing for fantasy sports was narrow, with fewer than 60 votes deciding the issue in East Feliciana Parish and 103 votes settling it in Natchitoches Parish.\n\nOpponents called legalization an expansion of gambling, but they failed to win over most of the state with the argument. Refusing to legalize the online fantasy sports competitions were: Allen, Avoyelles, Beauregard, Caldwell, Catahoula, Franklin, Grant, Jackson, Jefferson Davis, LaSalle, Morehouse, Richland, Sabine, Union, Vernon, West Carroll and Winn parishes.\n\nFANTASY SPORTS CELEBRATES\n\nDraftKings and FanDuel poured $1 million into a PAC called Fairness for Fantasy Sports Louisiana that pushed passage of the measure through targeted TV and radio ads, digital spots and mailers to individual homes.\n\n\u201cLast night\u2019s resounding results are a major step forward for sports fans in Louisiana.

Kirk Talbot, who sponsored the ballot proposal, said he expects sports enthusiasts will be able to start betting on fantasy sports around fall 2019.\n\nThough the games only will be permitted in parishes where voters authorized it, anybody will be able to log into the online sites if they travel to those parishes. Talbot said the sites will use a technology called geofencing to wall off designated areas, so people using computers or mobile phones outside of those spaces can\u2019t participate.

(AP Photo/Jessica Gresko)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court debated Wednesday whether to overturn a nearly $315 million judgment against Sudan stemming from the bombing of the USS Cole.\n\nThe question the justices are being asked to answer is where notice of the lawsuit against Sudan should have been mailed, to its embassy in Washington or its foreign ministry in the country\u2019s capital, Khartoum. It wasn\u2019t clear how the justices would rule.\n\nThe U.S. government has weighed in on the side of Sudan and against victims of the Cole bombing in October 2000 in which 17 sailors died and dozens of others were injured. In the case the justices were hearing, a group of injured sailors and several of their spouses sued Sudan in a U.S. court, arguing that Sudan had provided support to al-Qaida, which claimed responsibility for the attack in Yemen. Two sailors injured in the bombing and relatives of sailors who died watched the high court arguments Wednesday.\n\nIn order to alert Sudan to the lawsuit, the group mailed the required notice to Sudan\u2019s embassy in Washington, a little over a mile from the White House. Sudan never responded and a court entered an approximately $315 million judgment against the country. Sudan wants that judgment thrown out, arguing that notice of the lawsuit should have been sent overseas. The Trump administration agrees.\n\nThe case did not seem to be one that would split the court along typical ideological lines. Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Elena Kagan all seemed to approve of sending notice of the lawsuit to the embassy. Roberts said that his \u201cfirst thought\u201d if he wanted to send mail to a foreign official would be: \u201cWhy don\u2019t I deliver it to the embassy?\u201d Kagan, meanwhile, told lawyer Christopher Curran, who was arguing on behalf of Sudan, that \u201ceverybody understands that embassies are supposed to be the point of contact if you want to do anything with respect to a foreign government.\u201d\n\nBut Erica Ross, arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, told the justices that the United States doesn\u2019t accept notice of lawsuits at its embassies abroad and that the United States has an interest in seeing foreign countries \u201cbrought into our courts only under the same circumstances that we ask abroad.\u201d\n\nJustices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh all seemed inclined to side with the United States and Sudan. Sotomayor said it seemed natural to notify a foreign minister of a lawsuit \u201cwhere you\u2019re likely to find them,\u201d not at an embassy where they aren\u2019t regularly present.\n\nU.S. law doesn\u2019t make clear what the right answer is. A 1976 law called the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act lays out how to properly notify another country of a lawsuit filed in a U.S. court. If other agreements between the countries don\u2019t exist, the law says that notice should be \u201caddressed and dispatched ... to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of the foreign state concerned.\u201d\n\nLawyers for Sudan and for the U.S. government say the best reading of the law is that it requires the notice to be sent to the foreign minister in the foreign country. They also point out that an international treaty called the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which the United States signed, has been interpreted as prohibiting notice of a lawsuit to be mailed to an embassy.\n\nKannon Shanmugam, who was arguing for the USS Cole victims, said ruling for Sudan would force his clients to start their lawsuit over.\n\nAfter the arguments, Rick Harrison, who was injured in the attack, said the case has dragged on long enough and it \u201cwould be ridiculous\u201d to start over again.\n\nDavid Morales, who also was aboard the Cole when it was struck, attended arguments with a reminder of the bombing, a small piece of the ship\u2019s hull that he said he carries with him \u201ceverywhere I go.\u201d\n\nThe case is 16-1094, Republic of Sudan v.

(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara)\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida added 1.4 million possible voters to the rolls when it passed Amendment 4, a measure restoring the voting rights of felons who have served their sentences. But whether those people register to vote \u2014 and which political party they ultimately support \u2014 remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cThe battle for the hearts and minds for those 1.4 million voters has officially begun,\u201d said Neil Volz of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition.\n\nHe said about a third of the 1.4 million people affected are African-American. The largest percentage of disenfranchised felons is white, he said.\n\n\u201cEvery community is impacted by this,\u201d Volz said.\n\nStudies have shown disenfranchisement tends to take more votes from Democratic candidates. Restoration of voting rights for felons in Florida has traditionally been something that Democrats have pushed for and Republicans have resisted, but in today\u2019s topsy-turvy political climate, it\u2019s unclear what will happen when felons who qualify are able to register to vote on Jan. 8.\n\n\u201cPeople speculate about the party affiliations, but it\u2019s not such a simple thing to gauge,\u201d said Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, a group that pushes for sentencing reform.\n\nHe noted that a \u201csignificant number\u201d of people who cast ballots for Republicans Rick Scott in the Senate race and Ron DeSantis in the governor\u2019s race, also voted for Amendment 4.\n\nThe issue had widespread support from groups ranging from the NAACP to the Christian Coalition and the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\n\u201cWe won a lot of independent voters and Republican voters,\u201d said Howard Simon, Florida director of the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cYou have to focus on not how many votes we got, but the breadth of support.\u201d\n\nConvicted sex offenders and those convicted of murder will not be allowed to register to vote. The measure needed 60 percent of the vote Tuesday to pass; it received 64 percent.\n\n\u201cThis was not a political vote. It was a vote of love,\u201d said Desmond Meade, president of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, the nonprofit group that organized the drive to put the amendment change on the ballot.\n\nSupporters said the state\u2019s current system was too difficult and arbitrary. It required felons to wait at least five years after completing their sentence before they could file a request with the governor and Cabinet \u2014 who then considered the requests individually.\n\nFlorida has long been considered \u201cground zero\u201d for disenfranchised felons by voting rights groups.\n\nOf the 6.1 million disenfranchised felons in the U.S., about 1.7 million live in Florida \u2014 the most of any state, Mauer said. Only 12 states disenfranchise people for a felony conviction after they\u2019ve served their sentence, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled that the people of Florida finally brought the state out of the 19th century and into the 21st century,\u201d Simon said.\n\nAfter Jan. 8, the next hurdle will be persuading folks to register to vote.\n\n\u201cThe idea that we\u2019re suddenly going to have 10 percent more registered voters by 2020 is fanciful,\u201d said Dan Smith, chair of the political science department at the University of Florida. \u201cLet\u2019s say these people do get registered to vote, then they need to turn out to vote. As we saw with the turnout yesterday, turnout was up, but it wasn\u2019t up uniformly.\u201d\n\nFor Coral Nichols, a 40-year-old from Seminole, she\u2019ll register as soon as possible. She was convicted of felony grand theft at 23, served four years in prison and completed 10 years of probation. She now co-owns a nonprofit that helps people facing charges with diversion programs.\n\n\u201cI am a changed individual. I\u2019m not that girl anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cI deserve a second chance. In 2020, I\u2019m going to get to vote.\u201d\n\nNichols said she doesn\u2019t know enough to support any particular politician, but will likely register as a Republican.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show voting rights will be restored when felons have completed their sentence and probation, not when they\u2019ve completed their sentence or go on probation.", "Woman accused of choking child in her custody several times\n\nRAINBOW CITY, Ala.

Greg Gianforte speaks as the results come in at the Hilton Garden Inn Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Bozeman, Mont. Gianforte has a lead over Democratic challenger Kathleen Williams, but Montana's U.S. House race is too close to call with votes left to be counted. (Rachel Leathe/Bozeman Daily Chronicle via AP)\n\nHELENA, Mont. (AP) \u2014 U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte defeated Democratic challenger Kathleen Williams in a Montana U.S. House race that wasn\u2019t decided until Wednesday morning, a win that gives the Republican incumbent his first full term after overcoming renewed attention on his attack against a reporter last year.\n\nGianforte, 57, won by campaigning as a strident supporter of President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda. He said in an interview Wednesday the election results demonstrated that\u2019s what Montana voters want from him. He pledged to keep his door open to anyone in the state who wants to talk about the issues.\n\n\u201cI have clear marching orders,\u201d Gianforte said. \u201cThe people want a representative in Montana that\u2019s going to continue working with President Trump to deliver results.\u201d\n\nGianforte will now be in the minority party after the Democrats won control of the House in Tuesday\u2019s election. He said he will work across the aisle to look for common ground that advances Montana\u2019s interests.\n\nGianforte said he expects to keep working with Democratic colleagues even if they act as a check on Trump and the president\u2019s agenda.\n\nThis was Gianforte\u2019s third statewide election in two years. He ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2016 against incumbent Democrat Steve Bullock, a race in which he spent more than $5 million of his own money. This time, he loaned his campaign $1 million to keep pace as Williams benefited from a fundraising surge in the final months of the race.\n\nLast May, Gianforte was elected to fill the U.S. House vacancy that opened when Ryan Zinke resigned to become Trump\u2019s Interior Department secretary. The day before that special election, he body-slammed Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs to the ground when the reporter tried to ask him a question at a campaign event. Gianforte pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault.\n\nGianforte has tried to avoid the issue during his campaign, repeatedly saying that he took responsibility and moved on. But Trump thrust the issue back in the spotlight last month during a rally in Missoula.\n\n\u201cAny guy that can do a body-slam \u2014 he\u2019s my kind of guy,\u201d Trump said.\n\nWilliams released an ad with an audio recording of the attack on the same day as Trump\u2019s comments. Then, about two weeks before the election, Jacobs\u2019 lawyer accused Gianforte of lying about the assault and misleading the media about the settlement between the congressman and the reporter.\n\nAttorney Geoffrey Genth sent a cease-and-desist letter threatening to cancel Jacobs\u2019 deal not to sue Gianforte if the congressman didn\u2019t stop referencing his initial statement to police that Jacobs attacked first and wrongly saying the deal was confidential.\n\nAsked whether he was concerned about the issue resurfacing late in the campaign, Gianforte gave a terse, one-word answer: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nBut in the end, reminding voters about the attack didn\u2019t hurt Gianforte at the polls.\n\nMontana voters said health care and the economy were the most important issues the nation was facing, according to an Associated Press survey.\n\nThose issues mirrored what the candidates focused on in their campaigns: Williams touted improving access to health care, while Gianforte highlighted the Republican tax cuts helping boost the economy.\n\nGianforte supporter Laura Fix, 57, said the main issue motivating her to vote was one the Republican campaigned on \u2014 tax cuts passed by the GOP-led Congress.\n\n\u201cThose tax cuts are important, and I hope there\u2019s more on the way,\u201d she said.\n\nGianforte\u2019s entry into politics came after a career as a successful technology entrepreneur who sold his software company to Oracle in 2011 for $1.8 billion.\n\nWilliams, 57, served three terms in the Montana House of Representatives from 2011 to 2015. Before she decided to challenge Gianforte, she was associate director of the Western Landowners Alliance and previously worked for Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.\n\nShe was one of a record number of women running for office across the U.S. this year. Williams won the five-way Democratic primary in June by defeating two male candidates who had outraised and outspent her.\n\nShe had sought to become the first Montana woman elected to Congress since Jeannette Rankin, who became the first female U.S. representative in 1916 and was elected again in 1940. To mark the symbolism of her campaign, Williams wore a pin on election night that was from Rankin\u2019s 1916 campaign.\n\nRepublicans have held Montana\u2019s only U.S. House seat since 1997, when former Democratic Rep. Pat Williams left office. Since then, no Democrat has won more than 46 percent of the vote in a House race.", "Recent editorials of statewide and national interest from New York\u2019s newspapers:\n\n___\n\nThe New York Daily News on fixing New York City\u2019s Board of Elections\n\nNov. 7\n\nIt\u2019s a depressing-as-hell comment on people whose job it is to collect and count ballots: Leaders of the New York City Board of Elections always hope for low turnout, because they simply can\u2019t handle large number of voters coming out to exercise the franchise.\n\nWhich is why when New Yorkers, bless them, turned out in droves for Tuesday\u2019s midterm election, the system broke down at polling place after polling place.\n\nScanning machines jammed and were taken offline for hours, apparently because some ballots had a little water on them. (Who\u2019da thunk it might rain? On planet Earth?)\n\nPaper poll books, as usual, dragged out the check-in process. (You want an electronic database of voter names? Sorcery!)\n\nThe two-page ballot, necessitated by stupid ballot questions and stupid judicial elections, meant twice as much paper for the scanners to scan. (Newsflash: An eight-year-old device designed solely to scan paper can\u2019t do it consistently.) Expect an even bigger mess when the machines\u2019 warranty expires in 2020, just when the next presidential election comes around.\n\nIt\u2019s all par for the course from the boss-run patronage pit, where borough party chiefs pick the commissioners.\n\nThis terrible status quo persists even as New York\u2019s supposedly enlightened citizens tsk-tsk about electoral dysfunction and shenanigans in Georgia, Kansas, Wisconsin and other states. Shame on us.\n\nThe state Legislature must dismantle and rebuild the city\u2019s Board of Elections.\n\nAnd it can wait no longer to offer in the Empire State what is already law of the land in 37 states: early voting.\n\nIt\u2019s egregiously undemocratic that single parents, people working hourly wages and any number of other would-be voters who have a hard time getting to the polls on a Tuesday have no other way to cast a ballot. Especially when Election Day snafus throw wrenches in the works.\n\nFix it. Fix it now.\n\nOnline: https://nydn.us/2RFXQVp\n\n___\n\nThe Times Herald-Record on school funding\n\nNov. 1\n\nWe like to think that elections can make a difference, that listening to candidates explain their approach to issues can guide us to vote for those who will work toward solutions.\n\nIn this region there is no more prevalent issue than the burden of property taxes. A day on the campaign trail does not pass without a candidate or voter or more likely both noting that New York is steadily losing population, a claim easily verified as factual by consulting Census records, and that the state\u2019s is among those with the highest taxes, a fact also verified by Census records. Anybody who has paid taxes each January and September can compare the bills and verify that schools are responsible for the largest proportion.\n\nSo as campaign issues go, this is one of the rare ones where the facts match the opinions.\n\nHow about solutions?\n\nNobody is promising to spend less on education and most voters are not pushing in that direction either. What both participants, candidate and voter alike, seem to want is an approach that would be more \u201cfair\u201d and that is where the discussion often seems to stop.\n\nIf taxing someone based on the value of their property is unfair, then you might think that taxing someone on the amount of money they earn would be fairer. However, any candidate willing to make such a proposal will quickly be attacked for raising taxes, even if those that go up would be balanced by those that go down.\n\nSo we pretend to talk about solutions while the rhetoric of campaigning rules out most of them.\n\nAdd to those impasses the perpetual clash between urban and rural schools, large and small districts, those in prosperous areas and those with greater needs and we have overlapping conversations with little hope for progress.\n\nThen add a challenge outlined by a recent story in the Times Herald-Record that nobody really wants to talk about, the fact that as costs and tax burdens for education increase, the size of our schools has been steadily decreasing. We truly are paying more for less and the only likely prospect for the future is even more spending, tempered only by the artificial cap on tax increases imposed by the Legislature, to educate fewer students.\n\nThis should be the subject of a statewide effort, one that would try to make schools more efficient and ensure truly equal opportunity, including such notions as access to both advanced courses and remedial help to improve graduation rates. But any statewide effort would run into the most sacred of all beliefs concerning education \u2014 local control.\n\nNowhere does that show up better than in the schools serving Tuxedo where sentiment opposing any future merger or combination has produced a district with 235 students, only 63 in the high school and a per-pupil spending cost of $56,090, more than double those in most other local districts.\n\nThat is what local control can bring, unchecked costs and limited opportunities for students. And while Tuxedo is an extreme example, it provides a warning for all those other districts where costs continue to rise and enrollments continue to drop.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2QqsOk6\n\n___\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on the Supreme Court\n\nNov. 6\n\nLiberals are predicting that the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority will rewrite laws according to their policy preferences. So someone should point out that the conservatives this week behaved as if laws mean what they say regardless of the policy outcome.\n\nIn Mount Lemmon Fire District v. Guido, the Court unanimously ruled Tuesday that small municipal employers could be sued under federal law for age discrimination. The case involved two laid-off firefighters of Mount Lemmon, Arizona, who said their employer violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. That law defines \u201cemployer\u201d as a person \u201cengaged in an industry affecting commerce who has twenty or more employees,\u201d and the \u201cterm also means (1) any agent of such a person, and (2) a State or political subdivision of a State.\u201d\n\nMount Lemmon Fire District argued it isn\u2019t an employer under the law since it employed fewer than 20 workers. But as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the majority, \u201cthe ordinary meaning of \u2018also means\u2019 is additive rather than clarifying.\u2019\u201d The Court\u2019s conservatives agreed with liberals though the ruling may subject cities to more litigation.\n\nThe Court on Monday also heard oral arguments in Virginia Uranium Inc. v. Warren, which challenges Virginia\u2019s 1983 moratorium on uranium mining. Owners of a uranium deposit in south-central Virginia claim the state mining ban is pre-empted by the federal Atomic Energy Act\u2019s regulation of radiation safety for milling and tailings.\n\nWhile states have nearly carte blanche to regulate mining within their borders, the landowners say the legislature was motivated by concern for the safety of uranium processing \u2014 not mining. But this is reading a legislative intent unsupported by the text.\n\nAs Justice Neil Gorsuch mused, \u201cDon\u2019t we get into trouble ... guessing what the motivations of a state legislature are and all the methodological, epistemological, and federalism questions that that raises?\u201d One problem with divining legislative intent, as Justice Elena Kagan pointed out, is that courts could come down different ways on identical state laws merely \u201cbecause the legislative history was different.\u201d\n\nChief Justice John Roberts raised a hypothetical in which some lawmakers asserted that banning mining \u201cis a great way to keep nuclear energy out of the state. What is the purpose of that legislation? How do you analyze that question?\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor chimed in: \u201cIs this going to require deposing every single legislative member?\u201d All good questions.\n\nThe judiciary\u2019s job is not to be legislative mind-readers. As Justice Gorsuch noted, the Court has allowed investigations into legislative intent in the narrow context of applying the Fourteenth Amendment. Yet the left has abused this exception to allege racial animus behind all sorts of neutrally applied state laws including voter ID requirements and bans on local minimum wages.\n\nUpholding Virginia\u2019s uranium moratorium may make it harder to challenge state actions that thwart mineral development like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s veto of a natural gas pipeline on the pretext of protecting the state\u2019s water supply. But it will be a victory for judicial modesty if liberals join conservatives in agreeing that deducing legislative intent is a rabbit hole judges shouldn\u2019t be diving down.\n\nOnline: https://on.wsj.com/2PKNVkh\n\n___\n\nThe Niagara Gazette on Siobhan O\u2019Connor\u2019s courage\n\nNov. 4\n\nSiobhan O\u2019Connor showed real courage.\n\nThe former administrative assistant for embattled Bishop Richard Malone stepped out of the shadows to help shed light on arguably the darkest period of time in the recent history of the Roman Catholic church.\n\nIn her interview last weekend with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d O\u2019Connor said she started providing information about the bishop\u2019s handling of sex abuse allegations to WKBW News Channel 7 reporter Charlie Specht because she was disturbed not only by the flood of calls from abuse victims she herself fielded in some cases but also by the approach taken by Malone when it came to dealing with what was obviously a very serious problem.\n\nWas she afraid?\n\nYes, O\u2019Connor admits she feared being sued or excommunicated from the church altogether.\n\nStill, she went forward, providing Specht with hundreds of internal church documents that offered an inside look at how Malone and others within the administration of the diocese dealt with claims of abuse and members of the clergy who were involved in inappropriate incidents that, in some cases, involved minors.\n\nO\u2019Connor has said that she became deeply disturbed by the lack of response from the diocese to claims of victim abuse, noting that she herself began answering calls from victims who, according to her, were not having their telephone calls returned.\n\nO\u2019Connor has also suggested that she objected strongly to Malone\u2019s decision in March to release a list of 42 priest who had been accused of molesting children because she knew dozens of other priests should have been included in the list but were not because Malone and diocesan attorneys set the criteria for release and essentially whittled the volume to end up with a smaller number.\n\nO\u2019Connor\u2019s bold move in sharing documents that describe in greater detail the true manner in which Malone and others approached the sexual abuse scandal has inspired others within the church to step forward as well.\n\nThe Rev. Robert Zilliox, pastor of St. Mary Church in Swormville, also appeared on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d to discuss his recommendations to the bishop where sexual abuse cases where concerned. Zilliox believes at least eight or nine more priests should have been removed from service due to abuse allegations. He described the whole situation as \u201cbeyond troubling.\u201d\n\nProminent local leaders, including local businessman and deacon Paul Snyder, have called on Malone to step down amid reports that he failed in his handling of all of the abuse cases tied to the church.\n\nSnyder referred to the situation as a \u201cscandal,\u201d while calling on the Pope to remove Malone, who has consistently stood firm suggesting a shepherd does not abandon his flock in its time of need.\n\nIn a statement to \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Malone said the diocese continues to \u201creach out to victims, remove clergy with substantiated allegations from ministry and cooperate with federal and state investigations.\u201d\n\nAs the news program noted, just one priest was put on leave during Malone\u2019s first six years of presiding over the Catholic Church in Buffalo and only after the scandal broke in March did he suspend 16 more members of the clergy for abuse.\n\nSo far, as \u201c60 Minutes\u201d noted, none have been removed from the priesthood.\n\nIf O\u2019Connor had not stepped forward, Catholics across Western New York would have less of an understanding of the full extent of the failure of Malone and top diocesan officials to take appropriate action where instances of abuse involving clergy members are concerned.\n\nNow that more light has been shed on the subject, it\u2019s clear Malone should heed the calls for his departure and allow someone else to handle the difficult job of restoring people\u2019s faith in the institution known as the Catholic Diocese of Buffalo.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2AS7ZbW\n\n___\n\nThe Adirondack Daily Enterprise on watching out for kids\n\nNov. 7\n\nSchool bus drivers must watch in shock, fear and anger as motorists ignore flashing red lights and extended stop sign arms to pass buses.

At far left is Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., with Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-N.C., chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democrats set to run the House for the first time in eight years have a brimming list of priorities to tackle, topped by election laws and ethics rules, prescription drug prices and infrastructure.\n\nBut with the 2020 presidential and congressional elections on the horizon \u2014 and yes, they\u2019re already coloring decision-making \u2014 most Democratic proposals have a better chance of becoming campaign issues than enacted law.\n\nOne thing seems certain: A Democratic-controlled House will mean plenty of hearings and investigations. Newly armed with the power to set the agenda and issue subpoenas, Democrats are itching to burrow into President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign\u2019s connections with Russia, his personal finances and his undermining of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law and environmental protections.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at Democrats\u2019 early priorities and the hurdles they face:\n\n___\n\nFIRST, DECISIONS\n\nUnlike the Senate, where determined opponents can use procedural roadblocks to derail the majority\u2019s legislative train, the House operates on raw political muscle. A united majority can get its way every time.\n\nBecause Democrats will control the schedule, GOP efforts to repeal Obama\u2019s health care law or broadly cut taxes anew won\u2019t see the light of day. That still leaves Democrats with decisions and internal divisions to sort through.\n\nOn what issues should they try striking deals with Trump and Republicans to show they can govern? Which bills should be designed to highlight their values, knowing that many will go nowhere in a GOP-run Senate? Which investigations could prove fruitful and sate liberal voters\u2019 demands for bruising Trump, and which risk becoming counterproductive distractions?\n\nDemocrats\u2019 answers will depend on who their leaders are, how demanding the party\u2019s hard-left base proves to be and how their burgeoning field of 2020 presidential candidates steers the debate.\n\n___\n\nLEADING OFF\n\nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., hoping to reprise her 2007 through 2010 role as speaker, has talked about a first bill \u2014 HR1 \u2014 revamping campaign finance laws, election statutes and ethics requirements. The goal: Demonstrating that Democrats care about reform and that Trump\u2019s \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d mantra has achieved anything but.\n\nWhile final decisions remain, Democrats are considering steps like curbing large political donations, toughening disclosure requirements for corporations and big contributors and offering public financing to congressional candidates. They could propose making it easier for people to register and vote, helping states protect ballot security, requiring presidential and vice presidential candidates to release tax returns and barring lawmakers from joining corporate boards.\n\n___\n\nOTHER EARLY GOALS\n\nDemocrats want to lower prescription drug costs, perhaps by letting the gigantic Medicare program negotiate prices for pharmaceuticals it purchases. This is a potential area for deal-making with Trump, who\u2019s discussed cutting drug costs.\n\nDemocrats want to reduce health care costs overall, which their candidates highlighted in their midterm election campaigns, and buttress Obama\u2019s health care law. Ways and Means Committee Democrats are considering reversing Trump\u2019s move to allow low-cost, short-term insurance policies that don\u2019t require coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThey also want to upgrade roads, schools, mass transit and communication systems in what Pelosi calls \u201ca new, green way,\u201d an effort Democrats say would raise paychecks. Trump has also championed infrastructure. The big dispute is over how to finance the mammoth investment.\n\n___\n\nALSO ON THE AGENDA\n\nEven as Trump made anti-immigrant fervor a focus of his campaigning for Republicans this year, Democrats talked of helping young \u201cDreamer\u201d migrants stay in the U.S. permanently. A battle with Trump, who has tried ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that protects hundreds of thousands of young migrants from deportation, ended in a Senate stalemate last winter.\n\nOther Democratic priorities include expanding background check requirements for gun purchasers; requiring civil rights protections for sexual orientation and gender identity and reversing Trump rollbacks of Obama-era curbs on greenhouse gas emissions and Trump\u2019s expansion of mineral drilling on public lands.\n\n___\n\nA TEMPTING TARGET\n\nHow to pay for their initiatives? Some Democrats say privately that one possibility is erasing reductions that last year\u2019s GOP-written, $1.5 trillion tax cut bestowed on wealthy Americans. That could provide real cash while bolstering Democrats\u2019 message that they\u2019re fighting for the middle class.\n\nAnother possibility is raising the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gasoline tax, last boosted in the 1990s, by up to 1 percent annually. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., likely next chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, proposed that last year.\n\nAs for the billions Trump wants to pay for his proposed wall with Mexico, Pelosi, an ardent foe of the structure, calls that \u201ca manhood issue\u201d for Trump that doesn\u2019t interest her.\n\n___\n\nIMPEACHMENT? NYET, FOR NOW\n\nMany hard-left Democrats are itching for an impeachment showdown. Party leaders worry that without a bombshell from special counsel Robert Mueller about Russia\u2019s role in Trump\u2019s campaign, an impeachment drive would alienate moderates and independents.\n\nBut House probes of the Russia connection remains fair game.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s top Democrat, wants to learn if Russians used laundered money for transactions with the Trump Organization, which runs the president\u2019s businesses. He also wants more information about communications the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., had with his father and others about a June 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer.\n\nThe judiciary committee could try moving legislation protecting Mueller. Trump has repeatedly criticized the special counsel as running a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFOR INVESTIGATIONS, A TARGET-RICH ENVIRONMENT\n\nObtaining Trump\u2019s tax returns, and their untold detail on his business entanglements and tax strategies, has been a top Democratic priority.\n\nCongress\u2019 tax-writing committees can by law obtain records from the IRS. Trump, who\u2019s refused to release them, might not comply, sparking a court fight and letting Republicans argue that Democrats are going after their political opponents\u2019 tax records.\n\nOther areas Democrats could aggressively pursue include:\n\n\u2014Whether Trump violated the Constitution\u2019s ban on presidents accepting gifts from foreign governments;\n\n\u2014The administration\u2019s decision not to oppose efforts by 20 GOP state attorneys general to invalidate the health care law;\n\n\u2014Trump\u2019s separation of migrant children from their parents;\n\n\u2014The FBI investigation of sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation fight, and whether the White House curtailed it;\n\n\u2014Forcing pharmaceutical executives to testify on drug prices.\n\n\u2014Investigating Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke over a Montana land deal and a rejected Connecticut casino project.\n\n___\n\nAP congressional correspondent Lisa Mascaro and reporters Matthew Daly, Mary Clare Jalonick and Kevin Freking contributed.", "Republican Greg Gianforte defeats Democrat Kathleen Williams to win first full US House term in Montana", "SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) \u2014 Wolves from two packs that have been preying on cattle in the northeastern corner of the state will be killed, the state Department of Fish and Wildlife said Wednesday morning.\n\nHunters will kill members of the Smackout Pack in Stevens County and members of the Togo Pack in Ferry County, the agency said.\n\nWolves from the two packs have continued to prey on cattle despite efforts to get them to stop, agency director Kelly Susewind said.\n\n\u201cWDFW staff have confirmed that on five separate occasions since Aug. 20, one or more members of the Smackout pack injured one calf and killed four heifers on private pastures,\u201d the agency said in a news release.\n\nMeanwhile, the agency documented six depredations by members of the Togo Pack in the past 10 months, and the remaining three wolves in that pack will be killed.\n\nThe hunting of wolves can begin on Thursday, the agency said.\n\nLast month the state decided to kill the remaining two wolves from the Old Profanity Peak Territory Pack, which has repeatedly preyed on cattle in Ferry County.\n\nThe Center for Biological Diversity and other conservation groups have criticized the killing of wolves to save cattle grazing on public lands.\n\nWolves were killed off in Washington state early in the past century. But they began moving back into the state early in this century from Idaho and Canada. That has created intense conflicts with ranchers in the mountainous and sparcely-populated northeastern part of the state\n\nWolves are listed as an endangered species throughout Washington. But a management plan allows the state to kill wolves if officials confirm a certain number of livestock attacks within a specific time period.\n\nIn the case of the Smackout Pack, Susewind authorized incremental removal of wolves from the pack.

(AP Photo/Darron Cummings, File)\n\nCORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The only Atlantic Coast Conference Coastal Division teams that have yet to appear in the league\u2019s championship game are Pittsburgh and Virginia.\n\nPitt leads the Coastal right now.\n\nVirginia sits alone in second place.\n\nGo figure. There\u2019s Coastal chaos, again.\n\nWhile the Atlantic Division has a clear frontrunner \u2014 Clemson, which can lock up its fourth consecutive berth in the ACC title game if it wins at Boston College on Saturday night \u2014 the Coastal is what seems to be its annual mess. Pitt is alone in first at 4-1, and Virginia is a half-game back of the Panthers at 4-2. If Pitt beats Virginia Tech on Saturday the Panthers will grab total division control of the race; if the Hokies win, there will be a three-way tie atop the division with two games left.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even starting to try to do any kind of math regarding the Coastal,\u201d Miami coach Mark Richt said.\n\nHere\u2019s the easy math: If Pitt beats Virginia Tech and then tops either Wake Forest or Miami, the Panthers win the Coastal.\n\nIf the Hokies win this weekend, grab your calculators and tiebreaker rule breakdowns because there will be a three-way tie with two games left \u2014 and potentially two teams just one game back in the loss column behind that logjam. But the Panthers will not be obsessing about the importance of this weekend\u2019s game against the Hokies from a Coastal perspective.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to address it,\u201d Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a bunch of hungry teams sitting below us. Doesn\u2019t really matter. I know they read on Twitter, all that stuff. I guess I don\u2019t have to address it. I\u2019m going to address what we need to take care of, is the business at hand. All that doesn\u2019t matter if we don\u2019t do what we need to.\u201d\n\nThis will be the 12th time in 14 seasons of ACC divisional play that the Coastal champ has lost at least one league game. There\u2019s been a two- or three-league-loss champion of the Coastal five times in that span.\n\nA three-way Coastal tie at 5-3 this season? It\u2019s possible if Pitt loses this weekend. Technically, so is a four-way tie at 5-3, but that would require Duke winning out \u2014 and Clemson is one of the three teams left on the Blue Devils\u2019 schedule, so that seems unlikely at best. Reigning Coastal champ Miami could still get to 5-3, and if they get into the right tiebreaker the Hurricanes somehow have ways to win the division.\n\nVirginia is taking the week off from ACC play. The Cavaliers play host to Liberty this week in their home finale, and Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall insisted he\u2019s not thinking about Coastal permutations.\n\nHe acknowledged that there\u2019s a two-game \u201cfight to the end\u201d awaiting in the Coastal after this week, and that was as far as he went.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, I really won\u2019t address anything other than the Liberty game going forward,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve shared with the team. Now our focus is to play the best football we can this week with that being our only focus.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh and Virginia are the latest examples of teams that seemed to come from nowhere and announce themselves as serious contenders for a spot in the conference title game.\n\nNeither team got a single Coastal first-place vote out of 148 ballots cast in the ACC preseason poll, and Virginia could be the second team in the last six years to be picked last but end up winning the division. Duke pulled that off in 2013.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything yet,\u201d Narduzzi said. \u201cWe really haven\u2019t done anything. We got a long way to go. ... Premature victories are no good. We\u2019re not looking for one, either.\u201d\n\nIf Pitt or Virginia wins the Coastal, it\u2019ll mark a sixth different school winning the division in the last six years. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic it\u2019s been either Florida State or Clemson as division champ in every season since 2009 \u2014 and the Tigers seem very poised to have that streak reach 10 years and counting.\n\nRicht thinks the Coastal is in a cycle where experience matters, and some years some teams just don\u2019t have enough of that.\n\n\u201cNo one has jumped out in regard to out-recruiting, out-developing the other group,\u201d Richt said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we want to become. We want to become that team.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Goodyear police say a 37-year-old man arrested while carrying a holstered BB gun and filming at an election polling place during Tuesday\u2019s election told officers he went there to vote and also record how voting is conducted.\n\nBrad Michael Luebke of Litchfield Park remained jail Wednesday on suspicion of disorderly conduct and other charges, and court records don\u2019t list an attorney who could comment on the allegations.\n\nPolice said in a probable cause statement that people at the polling station felt threatened and that Luebke yelled loudly and called for other people to help him after police handcuffed him.\n\nArizona law which prohibits filming within 75 feet (23 meters) of polling locations.", "DENVER (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Colorado\u2019s election (all times local):\n\n2 p.m.\n\nDemocrat Phil Weiser has defeated Republican George Brauchler to become Colorado attorney general.\n\nWeiser is a former University of Colorado Law School dean who served in the U.S. Justice Department under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\nBrauchler is a district attorney in suburban Denver who\u2019s best known for prosecuting the gunman who killed 12 people in a movie theater in Aurora.

A neighbor said he saw someone shoot Niles in the couple\u2019s driveway after shooting Washburn, who was sitting in her car with the 4-year-old son she had with Niles. The child was not injured.\n\nCharlene Childers, whose husband is accused of the murders, is Niles\u2019 ex-girlfriend and the mother of two of his other children. Friends and relatives said Niles had recently won custody of his and Childers\u2019 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son.\n\nPolice do not have evidence of Childers being in New York on the day of the killings, but they believe her husband, 32-year-old Timothy Dean, had driven 1,400 miles from Texas to get there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our belief that Dean pulled the trigger,\u201d Wayne County Sheriff Barry Virts said.\n\nDean, the former police chief of the Texas Panhandle city of Sunray, was charged Monday with first- and second-degree murder and conspiracy in the slayings. Childers, 25, was charged with conspiracy the same day.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, authorities said they arrested a third suspect at his Texas home, 34-year-old Bron Bohlar, on a warrant for conspiracy.

Niles and Washburn were shot with a 9mm firearm, but the exact type isn\u2019t known, Virts said.\n\nInvestigators were still trying to learn details of Childers\u2019 and Dean\u2019s travels before the shooting, but police have said they believe Childers was in Texas when it occurred, despite her attendance at a vigil for the victims held in Sodus two days after the slayings.\n\n\u201cWe have no indication that she was in our jurisdiction on the date of the shooting,\u201d Wayne County District Attorney Michael Caralco said.\n\nDean is believed to have driven the 2,800-mile (4,500-kilometer) roundtrip from Sunray to Sodus, Caralco said. There is no timeline yet for when Dean will be extradited to New York, he said.\n\nDean was head of the three-member Sunray police force from October 2016 to June 2018, resigning about a month after his arrest on a charge of injury to a child, Texas officials said.

Tester has won a third term in the U.S. Senate by beating Republican Matt Rosendale. Tester won Tuesday's close election despite President Donald Trump taking a personal interest in defeating him. (Thom Bridge /Independent Record via AP)\n\nBILLINGS, Mont. (AP) \u2014 Only U.S. Sen. Jon Tester of Montana survived President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive campaign to topple Democratic senators from Republican-leaning states who voted against his Supreme Court picks.\n\nThe president and his surrogates returned repeatedly to Montana, North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana this election season, pounding on Tester and other incumbent Democrats who opposed the nominations of Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.\n\nConservative groups followed the White House\u2019s lead by pouring tens of millions of dollars into ad campaigns against the Democratic senators. Tester earned particular ire for his central role in derailing Trump\u2019s pick for Veteran Affairs secretary, Ronny Jackson, by airing misconduct allegations against the White House doctor.\n\nOn Tester\u2019s turf, the president\u2019s attention was enough to raise Montana state Auditor Matt Rosendale from political obscurity to a contender in a race that set a state record for political spending.\n\nWhile other Democrats in states that Trump carried in 2016 went down Tuesday \u2014 Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Joe Donnelly in Indiana \u2014 Tester\u2019s victory helped blunt the GOP\u2019s expansion of its majority in the Senate. Joe Manchin held on in West Virginia, but he backed the president\u2019s court nominees.\n\nMontana Sen. Jon Tester won re-election in a hotly contested race where President Donald Trump took a personal interest in the race and made four trips to the state to campaign for his opponent, Matt Rosendale. (Nov. 7)\n\nTester fended off his opponent by combining his populist appeal as the Senate\u2019s only farmer with a message heavy on health care and veterans\u2019 issues. He targeted female voters with frequent references to the need to protect reproductive choice. Tester also reached out to young people who might be disaffected with Trump.\n\nThrough it all, Tester avoided tangling directly with the president. He sought to defuse their feud by frequently citing veterans\u2019 legislation that the Democrat sponsored and Trump signed.\n\nThe conciliatory tone continued after the election results trickled in Wednesday, even as Democrats elsewhere appeared emboldened to take on Trump after their party captured a U.S. House majority.\n\n\u201cMontanans spoke loud and clear about the direction they want Montana to go,\u201d Tester said during a victory speech to supporters in the city of Great Falls. \u201cThe people I talked to, the biggest issue they bring up is, \u2018Why can\u2019t you guys work together?\u2019 We can, and we will.\u201d\n\nThe White House campaign to take down Tester and install Rosendale also included multiple visits by Vice President Mike Pence and the president\u2019s son.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the Tester brand was able to stave off the Trump brand,\u201d said Jeremy Johnson, a political analyst at Carroll College in the state capital of Helena.\n\nThe result, Johnson added, suggests Montana has managed to avoid at least some of the polarization Trump has stoked elsewhere in the country.\n\nBillings voter and Tester supporter Lynne Fitzgerald said the negative advertising in the Senate race was a turnoff. But she liked what Tester had to say, particularly about accepting people of different backgrounds in contrast to Trump\u2019s propensity to stoke division.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about who\u2019s going to work together, who\u2019s going to get things changed,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cHe has the best interests of Montanans in mind.\u201d\n\nTester, 62, is a farmer and a former music teacher from the small community of Big Sandy who won his seat in 2006 by defeating then-U.S. Sen. Conrad Burns. Six years later, Tester beat then-U.S. Rep. Denny Rehberg.\n\nIn 2012 and again this year, Republicans tried to take down Tester with allegations he had become part of the same Washington establishment that he had pledged to challenge when he first ran.\n\nBut an Associated Press survey said the topic foremost on voters\u2019 minds this election season coincided with one of Tester\u2019s main issues \u2014 health care. It was more prominent than two issues frequently touted by Trump, immigration and the economy.\n\nThe survey also suggested that Tester\u2019s efforts to reach out to women worked, with the Democrat holding a significant advantage among female voters compared with his rival.\n\n\u201cWomen care about health care issues and they care about someone they can connect with,\u201d said Montana State University political analyst David Parker. \u201cWhat was warm and fuzzy about Matt Rosendale? What did he have to offer? There wasn\u2019t much there for women.\u201d\n\nRosendale won a four-way primary in June after the Republicans\u2019 first choice to challenge Tester, Ryan Zinke, resigned his U.S. House seat to become Trump\u2019s Interior Department secretary last year.\n\nRosendale made his campaign about backing Trump, who won a landslide victory in Montana in 2016. He framed himself as a champion of the president\u2019s agenda and Tester as selling out Montana\u2019s interests for those of the Senate\u2019s Democratic leaders.\n\nRosendale conceded defeat and called to congratulate Tester soon after The Associated Press called the race Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWhile we suffered a setback, our movement and our cause will continue to move forward,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n___\n\nFollow Matthew Brown on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MatthewBrownAP\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "GULFPORT, Miss.

The cards are required for employees who work at private security firms, such as those who guard homes and businesses and drive armored cars, and they require applicants to pass criminal background checks.\n\nThe agency did not detail Sheehan\u2019s alleged misconduct. But an internal investigation found Sheehan violated five department policies, including those governing employee ethics, requiring timely and accurate reports, barring incompetent performance and requiring employees to follow orders, according to a termination letter obtained by the AP under the open records law.\n\nThe letter said his employment \u201chas been counterproductive to the best interests of the Department\u201d and that his actions were unacceptable.\n\nSheehan, 59, \u201cdid not show\u201d to Tuesday\u2019s meeting where he was to be given notice of his firing, according to the letter, signed by Public Safety Commissioner Roxann Ryan. A phone number for him was disconnected, and he didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment. He made $46,301 last year and earned roughly $10,000 during his paid leave.\n\nThe criminal investigation remains open, the department said, and the state auditor\u2019s office has been brought in to review identification cards that have been issued.\n\nIowa law requires anyone who operates a private security business to obtain a two-year license from the department, and to obtain ID cards for all of their employees. Applicants are required to be 18, have no prior convictions for felonies and aggravated misdemeanors and have no history of alcohol and drug abuse, mental illness or violence.\n\nSheehan, who had been with the department since 2005, processed and issued licenses and renewals for security businesses and employees. The department is supposed to conduct fingerprint-based criminal history record checks on applicants and verify that businesses have the required liability insurance.\n\nAs of 2016, more than 8,000 active ID cards had been issued to private security, investigative and bail enforcement employees, department data shows. A two-year business license costs $100 while each ID is $10. Employees are supposed to carry them while on duty.\n\nThe AP asked about the criminal investigation and Sheehan\u2019s status Oct. 4 after receiving a tip, but the department\u2019s public information officer, Sgt. Nathan Ludwig, never provided answers despite numerous inquiries. Another official provided information Tuesday night, as the midterm elections were under way.\n\nThe case marks the second time in two years that the department has come under scrutiny for improperly issuing official documents.

His show, \"Primordial Charms,\" opened in September and is on display through Jan. 13. (Josh Galemore/The Casper Star-Tribune via AP)\n\nCASPER, Wyo. (AP) \u2014 Color fills the gallery, where faces peer from portraits covering the walls almost from top to bottom. Sculptures crowd the center of the space at the Nicolaysen Art Museum. Figures wrapped in twine suspend from the ceiling, while characters made of bowling pins perch along a ledge at the top of the gallery walls.\n\nIn the past year, Casper artist Jim Kopp created most of the hundreds of artworks \u2014 sculptures, assemblages and paintings \u2014 that fill the Ptasynski Gallery at the museum. His show, \u201cPrimordial Charms,\u201d opened last month and is on display through Jan. 13.\n\nFrom an intuitive space in his mind, Kopp constantly creates art in his unique style, which those who have seen can recognize on sight.\n\nKopp\u2019s mother died in 1999, the same year he saw an exhibit at High Museum of Atlanta by Howard Finster, a well-known folk artist on the East Coast. Inspired by her death and Finster\u2019s work, Kopp started painting on wood and canvas, often including various found objects in his art, just a few of which include small vintage toys, bear-shaped honey bottles and paint can lids.\n\nTeaching himself didn\u2019t go as quickly as formally studying art. But it\u2019s been a way to hone his own creative voice, he said. Self-taught art tends to be more about emotion than the technical side, and artists tend to be prolific and often freely express progressive or even absurd ideas, Kopp said.\n\nThere\u2019s a tenacity that comes with being self-driven, he added.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re more concerned about creativity than technical skill,\u201d Kopp said of self-taught artists. \u201cAnd I like the rawness of it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not fine detail or realism that Kopp strives for, rather a deliberately primitive, intuitive style.\n\n\u201cPrimordial Charms\u201d features an vast array of painting and drawings along with sculptures and assemblages \u201cthat were conjured from an intuitive place in my mind as if they were charms \u2014 objects that represent the unknown powers that cross the line from another world to ours,\u201d according to his artist statement. \u201cBits and pieces of magic or unknown worlds from the past, present and future are revealed through the artwork much like charms, which have a fantastical or attractive appeal.\u201d\n\nA main goal of his was to use diverse mediums and branch out from paintings into three-dimensional art. Many of the sculptures represent objects called charms or fetishes, used around the world for good fortune. The show includes more than two dozen bowling pins painted as characters as well as figures of wood wrapped in twine and suspended from the ceiling.\n\nSeveral three-dimensional assemblages hanging in the gallery are ghostly pieces inspired by a blend of rural fables of Appalachia, including malevolent spirits called haints.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s kind of like a bridge between reality, our world, and another world,\u201d Kopp said.\n\nKopp created the sculptures with materials he found or that showed up on his porch, he said. Friends have left him barn wood from Montana, the bowling pins used for target practice and wood from hiking trails in the Bighorn Mountains.\n\nSculpting involves more physical labor, he said. For one set of sculptures, he hammered into 2x8-inch wood pieces with a chisel to create characters with recessed features made to look even more primordial, he said.\n\nThe paintings in the show depict \u201cplaces and interactions far away from our daily lives,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nThe themes behind each artwork range from daily life to William Blake\u2019s poetry to the dada art movement.\n\nMany of Kopp\u2019s ideas for sculptures arose from the materials themselves, like a large piece of wood and piano parts that showed up at his house and that became a sculpture called \u201cCentipede God.\u201d Piano hammers form the ends of the creature\u2019s appendages. Kopp had originally planned the bowling pin figures to surround it like worshipers, but ended placing them along the top of the gallery walls.\n\nWith artwork coming from an intuitive mindset, occasionally even he\u2019s not sure until later where his ideas came.\n\nOne assemblage depicts a figure skater reminiscent of monsters from children\u2019s book \u201cWhere the Wild Things Are,\u201d created from an array of materials including cardboard, a fast-food beverage holder and even a painting of ice skaters he\u2019d previously painted that look like they could be from a Claymation film. It was only months later when he looked back and realized he\u2019d created it during the Winter Olympics after hearing people on TV talk about Tonya Harding.\n\nKopp works as a full-time artist in Casper and sells his art in the community as well as across the U.S., Canada, Europe and as far as Australia.\n\nA few of his paintings even appeared on an episode of NBC\u2019s \u201cChicago P.D.\u201d A handful of his pieces recently were featured in the current issue of WRPD Magazine, a fashion, art and photography magazine in Rome.\n\nThe set of Kopp\u2019s \u201cMatriarchs and Warrior Queens\u201d was inspired by the recent women\u2019s marches and the #MeToo movement, he said. But he doesn\u2019t consider himself a political artist, though his daily experiences tend to come to the fore in his work.\n\nFor instance, one of his pieces titled \u201cSuper Mom\u201d is based on young mothers he\u2019s seen pushing strollers or carefully crossing streets with toddlers. The piece depicts a woman under a carousel symbolizing naivety as below her figures and creatures represent the evil in the world, which she fights to protect her children.\n\n\u201cAs they grow older and become more independent, things start to darken up a little bit,\u201d Kopp said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so naive anymore.\u201d\n\nPlayful humor and irony can be found throughout the show as well.\n\nOne sculpture of a carved, ghostly feline-like face atop a small, black wooden block is titled \u201cMonument to a Cryogeniced Apparition.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s like a ghost that\u2019s dead,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like they\u2019re trying to save this ghost that\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nSince his trip to Georgia where he discovered Finster, whom he had a chance to meet while the artist was alive, Kopp has been inspired by many other self-taught artists from all over the world.\n\nSelf-taught art is less common in Wyoming, though it enjoys a tradition and history in other regions including the South and the Eastern U.S. Prominent self-taught artists include R.A. Miller, whose art is housed in the Smithsonian. Kopp also owns an original Miller painting that attendees of his presentation will see. One of Kopp\u2019s all-time favorite artists is William Hawkins, who gained popularity as an artist in his 80s with huge paintings on Masonite in a bold, audacious style that sell for up to $100,000 each. Finster, Kopp\u2019s original inspiration, created album art for bands including R.E.M. and Talking Heads.\n\nKopp grew up in Pennsylvania and Florida and showed an early talent for drawing. It was only after he moved to Casper that he discovered self-taught art and his passion for visual art. Before that he was a musician, and he continues to plays drums and jazz vibraphone in Casper.\n\nIt\u2019s almost an overload when walking into Kopp\u2019s show, Nicolaysen curator of education Zhanna Gallegos said. The clutter is just as it should be for a folk artist, she added. He brings his own perspective on life and personality that flows though his art without adhering to rules of traditional art, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alive, and I think that\u2019s what his art is,\u201d Gallegos said. \u201cIt\u2019s a living art. It\u2019s a little bit eclectic and it\u2019s a lot of color and it\u2019s a lot of different material, and it\u2019s very tactile. It\u2019s very sensory.\u201d\n\nThe feast for the eyes is just the first impression, though.\n\n\u201cThen you start actually looking at the characters and start trying to figure out the story behind this,\u201d she said. \u201cI think you can be there for hours and hours.\u201d\n\nShe describes his art as whimsical but also ironic, and joyful while also containing sadness and even elements of the sinister. What some may see as simple, abstracted forms contain layers of emotional and symbolic complexity, Gallegos said.\n\nKopp\u2019s playful juxtapositions include a drawing with an angel pushing a lawnmower across a backdrop of one of Kopp\u2019s other worlds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just hilarious and makes you smile,\u201d Gallegos said \u201cAnd it shows you a little bit different perspective on everyday life.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Casper (Wyo.)

(AP) \u2014 Three Republican lawmakers in Kentucky have asked a judge to hide portions of a woman\u2019s testimony that describes details of allegations of sexual harassment and assault.\n\nThe woman and the lawmakers \u2014 Jeff Hoover, Michael Meredith and Jim DeCesare \u2014 signed a sexual harassment settlement last year that required everyone to keep the details secret. But two other state workers have filed lawsuits alleging they were punished for reporting the harassment.\n\nRecently, the woman who made the original accusations gave a six-hour deposition as part of those lawsuits. Attorneys who have seen the transcript say the woman extensively described her encounters with Hoover, the former House Speaker who was re-elected to his seat in the state House of Representatives without opposition on Tuesday. The testimony includes descriptions of inappropriate sexual contact, harassment, text messages, pictures and \u201cconduct in a parking lot of a local restaurant.\u201d\n\nLeslie Vose, an attorney who represents the three lawmakers, told the judge that information must be redacted because it would violate the settlement the woman signed with the lawmakers last year.\n\n\u201cJane Doe takes it upon herself to reiterate, embellish and possibly create information put into the record regarding some or all of my clients, to which they will have no opportunity to respond to defend themselves,\u201d Vose said.\n\nThe woman who made the accusations once worked for the House Republican Caucus. The lawsuits that prompted her deposition were filed by House Republican Caucus Communications Director Daisy Olivo and Brad Metcalf, the former House clerk. Both say they were punished for reporting the harassment to the state human resources department; Olivo says she was demoted while Metcalf was fired.\n\nWednesday, Shane Sidebottom, an attorney who represents Olivo and Metcalf, argued the public has a right to know the details of what happened.\n\n\u201cThis is a matter involving public officials based on alleged conduct they have committed against a public employee while she is working on behalf of Kentucky taxpayers,\u201d he said.\n\nHoover has denied he sexually harassed the woman, but admitted to sending her what he called inappropriate but consensual text messages. He has forcefully denied a physical relationship with her, and an attorney representing the woman has said allegations of \u201csexual relations\u201d between the two are \u201cabsolutely not true.\u201d\n\nBut Hans Poppe, another attorney representing the two state workers who was present during the woman\u2019s testimony, says the woman describes \u201cunwelcome touching in an inappropriate area\u201d by Hoover and that she was counseled by others to \u201ckeep Speaker Hoover happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom her perspective, she was sexually assaulted many, many times,\u201d he said.\n\nThere have been no criminal charges filed related to the accusations.\n\nHoover, Meredith, DeCesare and Republican Rep. Brian Linder all signed the $110,000 sexual harassment settlement last year. But it did not stay secret for long, as the Courier Journal wrote a story about it. Hoover ended up resigning as House Speaker, while the three other lawmakers all lost their committee chairmanships.\n\nAll four remain in the state legislature. Linder and DeCesare opted not to run for re-election. Hoover ran unopposed. Meredith defeated Democrat William \u201cBill\u201d Fishback on Tuesday by nearly 3,500 votes.\n\nIn April, the Legislative Research Commission gave Hoover a public reprimand and fined him $1,000.

(Amber Baesler/Jackson Hole News and Guide via AP)\n\nJACKSON, Wyo. (AP) \u2014 A child\u2019s curiosity coupled with wilderness is powerful.\n\nAt Teton Science Schools\u2019 forest kindergarten summer program, a bird book, spatula, rope and a few other key ingredients kept children happy and learning without the need for screens.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t ask for technology; it\u2019s not even really talked about,\u201d said Jane Strader, a prekindergarten teacher. \u201cI try to keep the materials as natural as possible. They seem to be fine without all that stuff, and I think it\u2019s a beautiful thing. It\u2019s awesome to see what they can come up with and create using their imaginations without using technology to spur ideas. They\u2019ve got it all in them already.\u201d\n\nTeton Science Schools experimented this summer with the idea of forest kindergartens, which are geared toward preschoolers ages 4 to 6 but called \u201ckindergarten\u201d because of the terminology of where they originated. Jane Strader and co-teacher Christina Macy led a pair of three-week sessions, one in Wyoming and one in Victor, Idaho. Each day was as long as a traditional school day and focused on outdoor play, hands-on experiential learning and children guiding their own discoveries.\n\nForest kindergartens, and the idea of youngsters spending more time outside, are exploding in popularity. A 2005 book by Richard Louv, \u201cLast Child in the Woods,\u201d coined the term \u201cnature deficit disorder.\u201d Documentaries like \u201cSchool\u2019s Out: Lessons from a Forest Kindergarten\u201d explore schooling that\u2019s radically different from the test-centric, screen-centric American philosophy.\n\nIt isn\u2019t all hype. A 2003 doctoral dissertation by Peter Hafner in Germany showed that graduates of German forest kindergartens had a \u201cclear advantage\u201d over graduates of regular kindergartens, outpacing their peers in cognitive and physical abilities, as well as in creativity and social development.\n\nAnother study on children in England and Wales found that forest kindergartens improved confidence, social skills, communication, motivation, physical skills, knowledge and understanding.\n\nForest schools are sweeping the U.K., and they are popping up in New Zealand, Japan, Israel and other countries. But since the programs are relatively new in the U.S., long-term results are unknown. A map on the American Forest Kindergarten Association\u2019s website shows that most states have a handful of programs.\n\nStrader stumbled into teaching at a forest kindergarten when she lived in Germany during college. The \u201ctotal happenstance,\u201d she said, was pivotal. She\u2019s since worked with influential leaders in the field of nature-based early education, like Ellen Doris and David Sobel at Antioch University.\n\n\u201cI was just totally amazed that education could look like that at such an early age and how formative it was for those children going into their school careers, how it prepared them socially and emotionally and connected them to the world around them and each other,\u201d Strader said. \u201cSince then I\u2019ve continued to pursue education with the goal of starting my own. It\u2019s wild. Life comes at you when you least expect it.\u201d\n\nAt R Park on Aug. 1, the students enjoyed the natural habitat. Some played with sticks in the water, imagining pontoon and sea planes taking off, or \u201ccaught\u201d fish with a rope. Mia Scharnhorst, 6, made a boat of two crossed sticks and tied a rope to it to drag it along the water. Her classmate Jed Bowerstock, 5, did something similar. The children were in their own worlds, creating fanciful additions with every passing moment.\n\nSome made a \u201criver\u201d in the gravel, using a spatula to dig in the dirt and working together to cause the water to run downstream.\n\n\u201cLook at it!\u201d Cassius Musser, 4, said. \u201cWe made a mini-Snake River.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just play,\u201d Charlotte Ahlum, 4, said.\n\nEarlier, she said, she got soaking wet in the pond.\n\nAnd that\u2019s OK. After the session in Victor, parents told Strader that the kids were \u201cpretty chewed up by the bugs\u201d and \u201csuper tired.\u201d While the bugs might be able to be mitigated, dealing with the second is less of a priority.\n\n\u201cThere might be a magical face painted on it (forest kindergarten), and it\u2019s true, extremely magical moments happen throughout the day,\u201d Strader said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not always pretty. They still get in fights, I still have to redirect, they\u2019re not always listening. It\u2019s real, it\u2019s raw, it\u2019s right there. There\u2019s nothing fake about it.\u201d\n\nA few feet away, Charlotte\u2019s classmate Flynn Jackson, 6, shouted ecstatically.\n\n\u201cI caught a thing! I caught a thing!\u201d he said.\n\nThe thing, or things, were grasshoppers that Flynn wanted to make an improvised bug catcher for.\n\n\u201cI bet it\u2019s going to bite me,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cI\u2019m going to make a natural habitat for them with some grass.\u201d\n\nBut what kind of grass? Flynn and his classmates looked up species of native plants in a guidebook. They learned that pineapple weed could make tea and that ticks sometimes hang out in sagebrush.\n\nParents, Strader said, like it when their kids come home with knowledge like this. The session at Snowdrift Farms in Victor focused on plants.\n\n\u201cThe kids all came home knowing the names of all these different wildflowers,\u201d Strader said. \u201cThe parents were pretty psyched on it.\u201d\n\nChildren in the forest kindergarten program needed a change of pace as the morning progressed. That\u2019s all part of Strader and Macy\u2019s plan and structure, which starts with free play, moves to \u201csit spots\u201d at a \u201cbase camp\u201d that stays the same all session, then back to play before lunch, with time allotted for naps and stories.\n\n\u201cI create rules with them in the beginning of the session,\u201d Strader said. \u201cSince it\u2019s their rules, it helps keep them accountable.\u201d\n\nShe softly sang a song about mountains, something she remembered from camp as a child, with hand gestures to reiterate the lyrics. Then, she instructed the children to go to their sit spots, quiet places they picked out in the beginning of the session, to draw things they found special and bring them back to share in a group meeting.\n\n\u201cThey can just breathe and observe,\u201d Strader said. \u201cThey say some beautiful things. I\u2019m amazed at their ability and their excitement to be there.\u201d\n\nStudents returned to the circle with observations of plants, bugs and some mythical creature sightings. Strader and Macy jotted it all down, taking notes of what the kids said and did so they could ask better questions later and facilitate educational play.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot less about what I want them to learn and a lot more about what they know and what they love and how I can draw them out to see it,\u201d Strader said.\n\nAnd with that, quiet reflection time was over. Children jumped up, excited to spend more time playing. Isaac Kinney, 5, and his buddy, Felix Fleck, 5, headed to a tipi they built from sticks while other boys and girls headed toward a zip line strung between two trees.\n\nAt the Teton Valley Community School in Victor, teachers already try to have weekly days in the woods.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked really hard these past three years to get our kids into the woods as often as possible,\u201d Strader said. \u201cThe magic and learning that happens in the woods is beyond the environment you could ever create in the classroom.\u201d\n\nAnother benefit of time spent in the forest, she said, is a shift in the teacher-student dynamic.\n\n\u201cI find that it evens the playing field,\u201d Strader said. \u201cI am no longer necessarily a teacher; I feel like I\u2019m more of a guide and a resource. They\u2019re problem solving, they\u2019re asking their own questions, they\u2019re laughing and playing in the most simple, free-form of ways. Kids come home tired and dirty and happy and asking questions.\u201d\n\nTrue forest kindergartens are year-round \u2014 rain, shine or snowstorm. Would that work in the Tetons, where Old Man Winter comes and stays with a vengeance?\n\nStrader thinks so. The forest kindergarten programs this summer were a trial run, minus the extreme weather.\n\n\u201cWinter would look different,\u201d she said. \u201cMy main crux right now is property and where to run the program. If it were to run in the winter it would definitely need some sort of indoor structure where kids can take their gloves off and eat lunch and dry their clothes.\u201d\n\nA yurt would be \u201cpretty ideal,\u201d Strader said. She\u2019s spending this fall visiting other model programs and how they work in freezing temperatures.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s definitely possible,\u201d Strader said.\n\nThere\u2019s a market for outdoor-based educational opportunities in Jackson. While parents certainly take their children outside, like the informal parent-led woods days with young children in Kelly, there aren\u2019t official forest kindergarten programs in the area. The closest is Roots For School, a forest preschool in McCall, Idaho, or the Honeybee Nature School in Ogden, Utah.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly a huge parent buy-in and interest in this community,\u201d Strader said. \u201cI feel like now, more than ever, is a time to get one going.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Jackson Hole (Wyo.)

But he tamped down talk of impeachment \u2014 a stand he took during the campaign.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should waste time on impeachment resolutions, even though I think he\u2019s committed impeachable offenses,\u201d Yarmuth said Wednesday. \u201cBecause impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. It has to be bipartisan or it would have no credibility with the nation.\u201d\n\nYarmuth has accused Trump of violating the U.S. Constitution\u2019s provision banning the acceptance of gifts from foreign and domestic interests.\n\nThe veteran congressman said he supports Pelosi\u2019s bid for speaker because of her track record of negotiating with a Republican president. Her first stint as speaker overlapped with George W. Bush\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the only person in the caucus who has had experience negotiating with the president of the other party,\u201d Yarmuth said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really important with Trump.\u201d\n\nWith Congress soon to be divided between a Republican Senate and a Democratic House, there are issues that could overcome partisan discord, Yarmuth said. He pointed to an infrastructure bill and criminal-justice changes as issues potentially ripe for deal making.\n\nHe predicted House Democrats will push aggressively for other priorities, even if those measures are stymied by Senate Republicans. Those issues include passing gun-safety legislation featuring universal background checks, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat we will be trying to do \u2014 aside from holding the Trump administration accountable, which is a top priority \u2014 is to show the American people what a Democratic government would look like,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether they\u2019re enacted or not, the American people will get to see \u2014 looking forward to 2020 \u2014 what it could be like, which I think is important.\u201d", "Rep.

(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey)\n\nVoters casting midterm election ballots in Tennessee are divided over the state of the nation, according to a wide-ranging survey of the American electorate.\n\nAs voters cast ballots for governor, U.S. Senate and members of Congress in Tuesday\u2019s elections, AP VoteCast found that slightly more than half of Tennessee voters said the country is on the right track, compared with a little less than half who said the country is headed in the wrong direction.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in Tennessee, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 139,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 3,831 voters and 779 nonvoters in the state of Tennessee \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nGRUELING SENATE SHOWDOWN\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn won a grueling contest to become the first female U.S. senator from Tennessee, keeping a key midterm seat under GOP control. She defeated Democratic former Gov. Phil Bredesen by closely aligning her bid with President Donald Trump, who drummed up support for her on three visits to the state that he won by 26 percentage points.\n\nBlackburn replaces retiring Sen. Bob Corker, who frequently clashed with Trump. The next senator rarely diverged from Trump, and touted his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall and tax cuts while blasting Bredesen\u2019s opposition to both. Bredsen had vowed to be an independent voice in Washington. Tennessee\u2019s governor from 2003 to 2011, he vowed if he had been elected to work with Trump when his ideas make sense for Tennessee and oppose the president when they did not.\n\nBlackburn thanked Trump in her victory speech and said she will be a leader who will \u201cwork with the president and keep this nation on the path to prosperity that we are on today.\u201d She said she will work to confirm more constitutional judges, decrease taxes, limit regulation, oppose abortion, protect gun rights, get federal spending under control and build the border wall.\n\nThe $85 million-plus race set a state record in spending by candidates and outside groups, gaining national interest because of its potential implications for the GOP\u2019s slim majority in the Senate.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR GOVERNOR\n\nRepublican businessman and political newcomer Bill Lee has won the Tennessee governor\u2019s race, defeating Democrat and former Nashville mayor Karl Dean. Lee will succeed Republican Gov. Bill Haslam, who was barred by term limits from seeking re-election.\n\nLee\u2019s election to a four-year term means Republicans are in a good position to retain their trifecta of power through the next round of congressional and state legislative redistricting after the 2020 census. Republicans already hold sizeable majorities in both legislative chambers in Tennessee.\n\nNick Crandall, a 28-year-old industrial machinery consultant who lives in Nashville, considers himself an independent who can vote either party. But this time he thought voting for nearly all Democrats would tamp down the divisiveness in the country. However, he did vote Lee, saying he liked the businessman\u2019s background.\n\nLee touted his business success \u2014 running Lee Company, a $225 million mechanical contracting and home services firm with more than 1,200 employees \u2014 as proof he was fit to govern.\n\n\u201cI always tend to favor private sector experience,\u201d Crandall said. \u201cBill Lee fit that bill for me today.\u201d\n\nDean had campaigned on vows to take a bipartisan approach to politics.\n\n___\n\nTOP ISSUES\n\nVoters considered several issues to be important to their vote in this midterm election, including immigration and health care by about a quarter each, the economy (2 in 10), trailed by terrorism and gun policy (both less than 1 in 10).\n\nMelissa Nelms, a Knoxville stay-at-home mother of three, said health care was her main concern as she voted. \u201cWe\u2019re a self-employed family that can\u2019t afford health insurance,\u201d Nelms said. \u201cWe\u2019re educated people. There\u2019s no reason our family shouldn\u2019t have health care, but we can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSTATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\nVoters have a positive view of the nation\u2019s current economic outlook \u2014 three-quarters said the nation\u2019s economy is good, compared with 25 percent who said it\u2019s not good.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP FACTOR\n\nFor about a third of Tennessee voters, President Donald Trump was not a factor they considered while casting their vote. By comparison, nearly 7 in 10 Trump was a reason for their vote.\n\nRobert and Laura DuBois, conservative Christians from Nashville, voted as avid Trump supporters. Robert Dubois was wearing a red hat with Trump\u2019s signature campaign slogan on it \u2014 Make America Great Again\u2014 when he voted. Both said they cast ballots for the Republican Blackburn for Senate believing she would back Trump\u2019s agenda. \u201cIf you are supporting Blackburn, then you are for Trump,\u201d said Robert DuBois, 50.\n\n___\n\nCONTROL OF CONGRESS\n\nTuesday\u2019s elections will determine control of Congress in the final two years of Trump\u2019s first term in office, and three-quarters of Tennessee voters said which party will hold control was very important as they considered their vote. Nearly 2 in 10 said it was somewhat important.\n\n___\n\nAP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate in all 50 states conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News.

That\u2019s the same as the start of this year\u2019s legislative session. Republicans currently hold four Senate seats. Former Republican Sen. Nicholas Kettle was charged with extorting sex from a page in February and resigned. Kettle has denied all charges. A Republican won that seat Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats also won all statewide and congressional offices. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, and Reps. James Langevin and David Cicilline were re-elected. Democratic Lt. Gov. Dan McKee, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea and Treasurer Seth Magaziner also earned a second term. Democrat Peter Neronha, a former U.S. attorney, was elected Rhode Island attorney general, succeeding the term-limited Democratic incumbent.\n\nDemocratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello was narrowly re-elected in Cranston.\n\nEmily Samsel, a spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Democratic Party, said the Democratic sweep \u201csends a message to Washington that Donald Trump does not speak for us.\u201d\n\nRepublican Allan Fung, who lost to Raimondo, said in his concession speech that it\u2019s not easy \u201cto take on a machine.\u201d", "FILE - In this April 12, 2018 file photo, FIFA President Gianni Infantino participates in the annual conference of the South American Football Confederation, CONMEBOL, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Qatar has just eight stadiums to host 64 games over an already-congested 28-day window in 2022. Expanding the field to 48 teams would mean 80 games, requiring more stadiums.

Some knockout matches would also have to be played simultaneously.\n\nFIFA have had to shorten the tournament by four days compared to this year\u2019s World Cup in Russia because it will be played in November and December in order to avoid desert heat. European leagues, who are set to lose peak weeks from their 2022-23 season, insist they cannot compromise again by giving FIFA more days from their November schedule.\n\n\u201cWe cannot make (the tournament) longer,\u201d Infantino told reporters at FIFA headquarters. \u201cIt is not ideal, that would entail to have (World Cup) matches simultaneously.\u201d\n\nThe 2026 World Cup in North America will feature 48 teams and a 34-day schedule. Infantino would like to move to the bigger format right away, but diplomatic challenges also count against expanding the tournament in 2022.\n\nQatar is preparing to build eight stadiums and host 32 teams, so would need to let neighboring countries stage games.\n\nInfantino said last month he asked the emir of Qatar if he would consider allowing games to be held elsewhere. However, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have all been part of an economic and travel boycott against Qatar for the past 18 months.\n\n\u201cIn light of the current circumstances in the region that we all know, well, I would be even happier if this could happen,\u201d Infantino said of the 48-team proposal. \u201cWhat are the chances? Small, certainly small.

State was driving for the go-ahead touchdown in the final minutes when receiver Emeka Emezie caught a pass from Ryan Finley and fumbled inches short of the goal line . Wake Forest recovered in the end zone for a touchback with 1:51 to play. Finley also threw an interception on his final, last-gasp deep pass with a second left.\n\nThe Wolfpack (6-2, 3-2 ACC, No. 14 CFP) have been pretty tough to beat ever since.\n\nThey won their last two games of 2017, then opened this season with a five-game winning streak, and the only teams to defeat them are presently in the top 15 \u2014 No. 2 Clemson and No. 13 Syracuse.\n\nThey\u2019re coming off a 47-28 rout of Florida State in which they raced out to a 17-0 lead and never let up.

It helps that freshman Ricky Person Jr. is healthy enough to form a strong one-two punch with Reggie Gallaspy. Person scored the first three touchdowns of his season \u2014 two rushing, one receiving \u2014 against the Seminoles. \u201cHim and Reggie in combination with each other, I think, is really good for our run game,\u201d Doeren said.\n\nWAKE VS.

(A Libertarian candidate is taking about 1 percent of the vote.)\n\nAn aide in Kemp\u2019s state office said Wednesday afternoon that about 22,000 provisional ballots are left to count, with a high proportion \u2014 but not all \u2014 expected to be counted.\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign manager, Lauren Groh-Wargo, estimates her candidate needs a net gain of about 15,000 votes to force a runoff.\n\nGeorgia's hotly contested and potentially historic governor's race may not be over yet, with Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp awaiting the final accounting of absentee and provisional ballots. (Nov. 7)\n\nKemp\u2019s campaign adviser, Ryan Mahoney, says that\u2019s mathematically impossible, but Groh-Wargo counters that the campaign isn\u2019t yet satisfied only 22,000 uncounted ballots remain.\n\nShe notes the estimate comes from Kemp\u2019s office, which she says should not be taken at face value considering the boss is on the ballot.\n\nWHY THIS RACE IS IMPORTANT\n\nAbrams\u2019 historic candidacy made this a race to watch from the start. She\u2019s already the first black woman in U.S. history to be a major party\u2019s gubernatorial nominee. In Georgia, one of the original 13 states, she\u2019d be the first woman, and the first nonwhite governor.\n\nBeyond breaking barriers, the matchup exhibits the nation\u2019s bitter partisan, ideological divides and underscores the cultural and racial fissures still lingering in the Deep South.\n\nAbrams is a 44-year-old lawyer, former state legislative leader and moonlighting romance novelist who campaigns as an unabashed liberal. She promises to expand Medicaid insurance coverage and prioritize spending on public education, while endorsing tighter gun regulations and criticizing President Donald Trump\u2019s hard line on immigration.\n\nKemp is a 55-year-old two-term secretary of state who\u2019s echoed Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric. He\u2019s flaunted his guns, chain saw and pickup truck in his campaign ads. He promises to \u201cput Georgians first,\u201d blasts \u201cfake news\u201d and lambastes Abrams as a tool of \u201csocialists\u201d and \u201cliberal billionaires\u201d who \u201cwant to turn Georgia into California.\u201d\n\nBoth nominees framed the race as a \u201cbattle for the soul\u201d of the state \u2014 a characterization supported by Georgians voting in numbers nearing their turnout for the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe stakes are high enough that Trump and former President Barack Obama made opposing visits within 48 hours on the final weekend. Oprah Winfrey, the media icon who typically sits out politics, came to campaign for Abrams.\n\nAll this plays out in a Georgia on the cusp of becoming a true battleground state ahead of the 2020 presidential campaign. As governor, Kemp would be Trump\u2019s biggest cheerleader in a state the president won by 5 percentage points in 2016. Abrams would be among the most coveted endorsers in what\u2019s likely to be a crowded Democratic field of aspiring presidents.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT\n\nKemp\u2019s aides say he\u2019s preparing his transition to take office in January.\n\nAbrams\u2019 camp says it\u2019s leaving open \u201call options,\u201d including litigation.\n\nSo in a race already fraught with racial innuendos surrounding the voting system that Kemp runs, the coming days will likely be neither calm, nor quiet.\n\nAbrams has called Kemp \u201can architect of voter suppression\u201d for the way he\u2019s managed voter registration rules and elections. In outlining the possibilities of a runoff, the campaign attributed an apparent rise in provisional and paper ballots to a shortage of reliable voting machines, and blamed Kemp for the lack of preparation.\n\nKemp has insisted he\u2019s done his job and argued that Abrams wants to help noncitizens vote illegally. He cited a speech in which she listed \u201cundocumented\u201d people as being part of her coalition.\n\nBut Kemp also had to acknowledge within days of Tuesday\u2019s voting that the online voter registration system he oversees was vulnerable to hackers. When a whistleblower alerted a voting rights lawyer who alerted the FBI and Kemp\u2019s office of an apparent weakness, Kemp accused the Georgia Democratic Party, without offering evidence, of trying to tamper with the system.\n\nGiven that environment, it\u2019s not unreasonable to wonder whether Abrams\u2019 supporters will accept Kemp\u2019s claim of outright victory.\n\n___\n\nFollow Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) \u2014 When Maria Valles Vda De Bonilla moved to the United States from El Salvador 16 years ago \u2014 at age 90 \u2014 there was one thing she requested: to become a citizen.\n\nShe wanted to be able to vote in the adopted country she loves, something she was never able to do in El Salvador \u2014 first because it wasn\u2019t legal for women to vote, and later because the polling locations were too far away and the journey was unsafe.\n\nTuesday afternoon, at age 106, Bonilla sat in her wheelchair in a bright sapphire dress in the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Fairfax County and took her oath of citizenship. She waved a tiny American flag and smiled, her eyes moist with tears.\n\n\u201cI am so happy, there are no words,\u201d said Bonilla, who was surrounded by 18 family members who came to celebrate their \u201cabuelita.\u201d\n\nBonilla \u2014 who lives in Gainesville with her daughter, grandchildren and great-grandchildren \u2014 is not registered to vote in Virginia, so she didn\u2019t get to cast a ballot vote in the midterm elections after her ceremony. But when you become a citizen at age 106, you\u2019re an optimist.\n\n\u201cNext time,\u201d she said, speaking in Spanish. \u201cGod willing.\u201d\n\nIt was a coincidence that the ceremony fell on Election Day. She was part of a routine naturalization ceremony with 12 other people from various countries, including Italy, India, Mexico, Cameroon and Thailand.\n\nShe\u2019s not the oldest person to be naturalized in this country. That honor goes to a Turkish immigrant who at age 117 took the oath in Los Angeles almost 20 years ago. But Bonilla is the oldest in recent memory, said Kimberly Zanotti, director of the Washington Field Office, who has worked at the office for seven years and in the Newark office for 18 years before that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic,\u201d Zanotti said\n\nBonilla was born on March 22, 1912 and lived in rural El Salvador, farming beans, corn, rice and lettuce for most of her life. She had 18 children, said her youngest daughter Bernarda Bonilla, 55. But only eight are still alive. Her husband died many years ago, though nobody remembers exactly when, her daughter said. Her oldest child is 75.\n\nWomen got the right to vote in El Salvador in 1939 when Bonilla was 27 years old. But she lived far from a polling location for many years and never made the trip. When she got older, she moved to San Salvador, where the streets were too dangerous for her to leave the house and vote, said her granddaughter Diana Cortez.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just walk around, no way,\u201d said her granddaughter Diana Cortez, 36. The criminal gang \u201cMS-13 has taken over the country.\u201d\n\nFreedom is one of the things that delights Bonilla about this country, Cortez said.\n\n\u201cShe can walk around, go outside day or night, without any fear,\u201d said Cortez, who is a manager at a health clinic. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that in El Salvador because of the crime.\u201d\n\nBonilla came to the United States in 2002 to follow her children, who were all living here and were worried about her living on her own at age 90. She also wanted to spend time with her grandchildren, who were all born here.\n\nWhen she arrived, she immediately fell in love with her new home. But in recent years, her heart has started to give out, Cortez said. In April, she had two heart attacks on the same day and almost died.\n\n\u201cShe asked God to give her extra time to so this could happen,\u201d Cortez said about her citizenship.\n\nWhen they got home from the hospital, Cortez filled out her grandmother\u2019s citizenship application and asked for a medical waiver, meaning Bonilla would not have to complete the civics and language exam to become naturalized. The waiver was granted last week after she was interviewed by immigration officials who reviewed her paperwork. Because of her health and age, immigration officials decided to have her ceremony as soon as possible.\n\nBonilla was one of 19,000 people naturalized in the Washington Field Office in the past year, and one of about 750,000 naturalized each year across the country.\n\nCortez said her grandmother is honored to be part of that group. She says the secret to her grandmother\u2019s longevity is a will to live.\n\n\u201cShe never thought she\u2019d live that long, to be honest,\u201d Cortez said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know why God decided to have her here at almost 107. He must have a reason for her to be here. She wants to be here.\u201d\n\nThen Cortez paused and added another small clue.\n\n\u201cBut grandma does like her tequila,\u201d she said. \u201cWe give her a shot sometimes. The doctor says not too much. He also says that she\u2019s 106, she can do what she wants.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Washington Post, http://www.washingtonpost.com", "Republican nominee for Congress Katie Arrington concedes the race to Democrat Joe Cunningham during her press conference at the Staybridge Suites in Mt.

(AP Photo/David Richard, File)\n\nBEREA, Ohio (AP) \u2014 The losses are piling up for the Browns \u2014 in the standings, and on the sideline.\n\nOn Wednesday, two defensive starters were added to the stack.\n\nCleveland placed linebacker Christian Kirksey and cornerback E.J. Gaines on injured reserve, ending their seasons with seven games remaining and putting further strain on a unit lacking quality depth and experience.\n\n\u201cThose two guys, they really set a precedent for what we wanted to do as a team, as a defense,\u201d said cornerback T.J. Carrie. \u201cAnd, of course, they\u2019ll still be here sparingly in and out throughout the week, but it\u2019s a lot different when they were on the field fighting with you, blood, sweat and tears with you, through the trenches.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to definitely miss that. Those are two players that we can\u2019t replace.\u201d\n\nOne of the team\u2019s captains, Kirksey injured his left hamstring in the second quarter Sunday as the Browns (2-6-1) lost their fourth straight game, 37-21 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nGaines sustained his second concussion in three weeks when he took a knee to the helmet while trying to make a tackle in the first quarter.\n\nThe loss of Kirksey is especially damaging because he\u2019s one of the team\u2019s leaders. The fifth-year pro has played on the weak side and in the middle this season, making 43 tackles and two interceptions.\n\n\u201cKirko is kind of the heart and soul of the defense, heart and soul of the team in the locker room, on the field, just how he goes about his business,\u201d said linebacker Joe Schobert, a 2017 Pro Bowler who returned to practice after missing three games with a hamstring injury. \u201cIt\u2019s the next-man-up mentality, but there\u2019s things that you\u2019re going to miss.\u201d\n\nSchobert\u2019s return will help ease the loss of Kirksey, and the Browns are expected to have defensive back Damarious Randall for Sunday\u2019s game against Atlanta after he missed last week\u2019s game with a groin injury.\n\nLinebacker Jamie Collins (ankle) and rookie cornerback Denzel Ward (hip) were limited in practice, but interim coach Gregg Williams expects both back on the field Thursday.\n\nRandall, who has played cornerback and free safety, felt he was healthy enough to play last week, but Williams kept him out so he would have the versatile defensive back for multiple games. Randall\u2019s absence became magnified when Ward and Gaines went down on the Chiefs\u2019 opening drive, forcing Williams to adjust his game plan against the NFL\u2019s most electrifying offense and play seldom-used reserves Denzel Rice and Tavierre Thomas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard,\u201d Carrie said of losing two key players. \u201cIt changes the game plan.

It is weird,\u201d Schobert said of being inactive. \u201cEspecially with a hamstring. You just walk around on the sideline feeling good and watching people on the field thinking you can be out there \u2014 wishing you could be out there.

(AP) \u2014 Wolves from two packs that have been preying on cattle in the northeastern corner of the state will be killed, the state Department of Fish and Wildlife said Wednesday morning.\n\nHunters will kill members of the Smackout Pack in Stevens County and members of the Togo Pack in Ferry County, the agency said.\n\nWolves from the two packs have continued to prey on cattle despite efforts to get them to stop, agency director Kelly Susewind said.\n\n\u201cWDFW staff have confirmed that on five separate occasions since Aug. 20, one or more members of the Smackout pack injured one calf and killed four heifers on private pastures,\u201d the agency said in a news release.\n\nMeanwhile, the agency documented six depredations by members of the Togo Pack in the past 10 months, and the remaining three wolves in that pack will be killed.\n\nThe hunting of wolves can begin on Thursday, the agency said.\n\nLast month the state decided to kill the remaining two wolves from the Old Profanity Peak Territory Pack, which has repeatedly preyed on cattle in Ferry County.\n\nThe Center for Biological Diversity and other conservation groups have criticized the killing of wolves to save cattle grazing on public lands.\n\nWolves were killed off in Washington state early in the past century. But they began moving back into the state early in this century from Idaho and Canada. That has created intense conflicts with ranchers in the mountainous and sparcely-populated northeastern part of the state\n\nWolves are listed as an endangered species throughout Washington. But a management plan allows the state to kill wolves if officials confirm a certain number of livestock attacks within a specific time period.\n\nIn the case of the Smackout Pack, Susewind authorized incremental removal of wolves from the pack. One or two wolves will be killed, and then there will be a halt to determine if that stops the depredations, the agency said.\n\nThe agency said it will use humane lethal removal methods consistent with state and federal laws. Likely options include shooting from a helicopter, trapping and shooting from the ground.\n\nThe department documented the existence of the pack in 2011. Recent surveys indicate the pack includes four or five adult wolves.\n\nIn the case of the Togo Pack, Susewind said a recent depredation was an indication that the pack behavior of preying on livestock has not changed.\n\nSusewind decided to issue a permit to the livestock owner allowing him, his immediate family, or his employees to kill wolves if they are within his private fenced pasture.\n\nSusewind decided to issue a permit rather than having department staff conduct the hunts because of a lack of resources due to having three hunts underway at the same time.\n\nThe Center for Biological Diversity has tried unsuccessfully to block past wolf hunts in court, saying that killing wolves ignores science and goes against the wishes of many in the state.\n\n\u201cWashington residents have made it clear that they support wolf recovery,\u201d Amaroq Weiss of the center said in a recent news release.\n\nThe state since 2012 has killed 21 wolves, 17 of them to benefit the same livestock owner, she said.\n\n\u201cWashington residents are fed up with wolf-management policies that reward livestock owners for irresponsible business practices,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cThe wildlife department\u2019s mission is to preserve and protect the state\u2019s wildlife.\u201d", "FIFA President Gianni Infantino speaks during an inauguration ceremony for the new building of the Asia Football Confederation in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Tuesday, Oct. 30, 2018.

You don\u2019t keep one foot in and one foot out,\u201d FIFA deputy secretary general Alasdair Bell said. \u201cThat would be the general approach we would follow, but of course lawyers can debate this for a long time.\u201d\n\nBoth Infantino and Bell were long-time staffers at UEFA, which has steadily changed Champions League prize money and entry rules to favor top clubs and stall breakaway threats.\n\n\u201cThis is the history of the last 20 years,\u201d said Infantino, who has clashed this year with European soccer officials and club leaders over FIFA\u2019s proposed Club World Cup project, which is funded by Japanese investor SoftBank.\n\nInfantino said his plan \u2014 potentially featuring 12 European clubs in a 24-team lineup, and worth a promised $3 billion every four years \u2014 could head off a private closed league.\n\n\u201cThe Club World Cup is the answer to any attempt to think even about any sort of breakaway leagues,\u201d he said.\n\nInfantino insisted while the plan would be lucrative for clubs taking part, it also kept money in the soccer family. FIFA would use 25 percent of revenue to share globally.\n\n\u201cIf the price to pay is to give proper revenues to a club participating in a Club World Cup but this allows us to ... give $1 million to Haiti who has nothing, or to Mongolia who has three time zones but only two football pitches, well then we should be I think doing that,\u201d he said.\n\nA FIFA task force will assess a revamp of competitions, including a new event for all national teams played every two years. A decision is expected in March when Infantino chairs a FIFA Council meeting in Miami.\n\nHe also believes the latest threat will calm.\n\n\u201cPeople are still quite reasonable,\u201d Infantino said. \u201cI trust certainly the club owners and presidents to be able to have a discussion.\u201d\n\nAlso Wednesday, Infantino addressed the \u201cFootball Leaks\u201d documents that showed him being pressured by wealthy clubs during his time as UEFA\u2019s top administrator to ensure they avoided a Champions League ban for breaking \u201cFinancial Fair Play\u201d rules designed to curb overspending.\n\nSome critics suggested Infantino overreached his duty when independent panels were investigating and judging clubs such as Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain.\n\n\u201cWe were doing our job and saved the system, and we saved European club football,\u201d Infantino said.\n\nIn further \u201cFootball Leaks\u201d fallout, Infantino said it was unfair that a childhood friend, Rinaldo Arnold, was under scrutiny. A special counsel is assessing if Arnold\u2019s work as a regional prosecutor in Switzerland is in conflict with private invitations to games from Infantino and their professional contacts.\n\n\u201cI think there are much more serious issues that can be looked at,\u201d the FIFA president said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "", "President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference in the East Room at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Suddenly facing life under divided government, President Donald Trump and congressional leaders talked bipartisanship Wednesday but then bluntly previewed the fault lines to come. Trump threatened to go after House Democrats who try to investigate him, while Rep. Nancy Pelosi said her party would be \u201ca check and balance\u201d against the White House.\n\nThe day after midterm elections reset Washington, Trump took a victory lap at a raucous news conference, celebrating Republican Senate wins but distancing himself from the GOP\u2019s loss of the House. He said he was interested in working with House Democrats but was ready to respond if he felt he was being ill-treated.\n\nAs long as Republicans have controlled both houses of Congress, Democrats have been hampered in pursuing any significant probes of Trump and his administration, and he made it clear he expects the Senate to follow that course.\n\n\u201cThey can play that game,\u201d he said of possible House Democratic investigations, \u201cbut we can play it better, because we have a thing called the United States Senate.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump is warning House Democrats about spending the remaining years of his presidency investigating him and his administration. (Nov. 7)\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said Democrats must decide how much \u201charassment\u201d they want to pursue against Trump, while suggesting there could be limited opportunities to work across the aisle. And Pelosi, who is expected to run for a second stint as speaker when Democrats take the House majority in January, said the party has \u201ca responsibility to seek common ground where we can.\u201d But she added, \u201cWhere we cannot, we must stand our ground.\u201d\n\nAfter midterm elections that served as a referendum on Trump\u2019s divisive presidency, Congress and the White House reckoned Wednesday with expected Republican gains in the Senate and a Democratic flip of the House. The early positioning provided the first glimpse of how all parties will balance calls for bipartisanship with an appetite for anger going into the next two years.\n\nBy turns combative and conciliatory, Trump said Democrats and Republicans should set aside partisanship to work together. On legislative prospects, Trump said he could potentially work with Democrats on issues such as taxes, infrastructure and health care, saying it \u201creally could be a beautiful, bipartisan type of situation.\u201d\n\nAnd Pelosi, during a news conference that was delayed because of Trump\u2019s lengthy remarks, said she had worked productively with President George W. Bush when she was speaker a decade ago on taxes and other issues, and she welcomed the chance to do so again with Trump.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to work together so our legislation will be bipartisan,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, Pelosi said Democrats weren\u2019t elected to be \u201ca rubber stamp\u201d for Trump.\n\nSome House Democrats have threatened to use the subpoena power they will gain in January to investigate Trump and administration actions. But, he warned, he will respond in kind and government will suffer.\n\nPlus, he said, Democrats have \u201cnothing, zero,\u201d on him. Of the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation that has shadowed his administration for more than 18 months, Trump said, \u201cI could end it right now\u201d but \u201cI let it go on.\u201d\n\nShortly thereafter, however, it was announced that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had been forced out. His departure followed 18 months of criticism and insults from Trump, who had appointed him but objected to Sessions\u2019 stepping aside from the Russia probe rather than guiding. It.\n\nOn the potential for House investigations, Pelosi said Democrats will have a \u201cresponsibility for oversight\u201d when they take charge in January and she will leave final decisions to committees. She wouldn\u2019t answer a question about whether Democrats will seek Trump\u2019s tax filings, but said committee requests for documents and hearings won\u2019t be \u201cscattershot.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are expected to investigate Trump\u2019s business dealings, his Cabinet\u2019s conduct and his campaign\u2019s possible ties to Russia, among other issues.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll know what we are doing and we\u2019ll do it right,\u201d she said.\n\nPelosi spoke with Trump and McConnell after the Democrats\u2019 victory. McConnell said Wednesday that the two had discussed how they might \u201cfind a way forward\u201d in a divided Congress.\n\nHe and Pelosi, the Kentucky senator said, are \u201cnot unfamiliar\u201d with one another as longtime leaders and colleagues.\n\nAs for congressional action the rest of this year, he said he could not imagine taking up immigration and acknowledged that the Democratic House and Republican Senate were likely to go their separate ways when it comes to the legislative agenda\n\n\u201cAreas for legislative agreement will be more limited,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe one issue that Leader Pelosi and I discussed this morning where there could be a possible bipartisan agreement would be something on infrastructure, but there could be a lot of other things,\u201d he said.\n\nMcConnell also echoed Trumps\u2019 warnings on investigations, saying: \u201cThe Democrats in the House will have to decide just how much presidential harassment they think is good strategy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP writer Eric Tucker contributed.", "BLACK MOUNTAIN, N.C.

(AP) \u2014 The latest in a long line of what had been unsuccessful Democratic U.S. House challengers in South Carolina\u2019s 1st Congressional District actually made an impression the first time he met the Republican mayor of Folly Beach.\n\nBut even with some Republican backing, Mayor Tim Goodwin is surprised his city will be represented by a Democrat for the first time in nearly 40 years after attorney and ocean engineer Joe Cunningham flipped the seat from GOP control in Tuesday\u2019s elections.\n\nCunningham knew the issues and wanted to protect the beaches and the gentle, salt-water dominated Lowcountry way of life, Goodwin said, recalling that first meeting. But at the time, the mayor backed the incumbent, U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford.\n\nAfter Sanford was defeated by state Rep. Katie Arrington in the June primary, Goodwin had some thinking to do. Arrington was a full-throated supporter of President Donald Trump and his bare-knuckle divisive politics. She supported offshore drilling and rubbed Goodwin the wrong way by characterizing Democrats as evil.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go saying you ought to vote for me because this other guy supports me,\u201d said Goodwin, who appeared with three other local Republican officials in an ad supporting Cunningham.\n\nA U.S. house district that includes Charleston, South Carolina has elected a Democrat for the first time in 40 years. Attorney and ocean engineer Joe Cunningham flipped the seat from GOP control in Tuesday's elections. (Nov. 8)\n\nCunningham defeated Arrington by about 4,000 votes Tuesday, just barely over the 1 percent threshold needed to avoid an automatic recount. On the surface, it was a stunning win. A Democrat last won in the district that stretches from Charleston to Hilton Head Island in 1978.\n\nTrump won the district 54 percent to 40 percent for Hillary Clinton in 2016 \u2014 although that was the smallest margin of the six Republican controlled districts in South Carolina. The 1st District is also richer and better educated than most of the state.\n\nCunningham, 36, followed the old axiom that all politics are local. He hammered Arrington\u2019s support of offshore drilling in the Republican primary even as she tried to walk it back in the general election. He promised he would not support Nancy Pelosi for House speaker from the beginning of his campaign. He said a U.S. Representative needs to represent all the people when Arrington suggested the race was a choice between good and evil.\n\nAnd Cunningham met people. He tried to talk to every local leader he could, Republican or Democrat. And many of them gave him a chance at least for a little while.\n\n\u201cHe seems like an honest, hard-working young man,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cIf not, this is only a two-year stint.\u201d\n\nCunningham promised to serve no more than three terms and said he would \u201cwork across the aisle\u201d at least a half-dozen times at a news conference Wednesday.\n\n\u201cFor the people who voted for my opponent, I want you to know my door will always be open and you\u2019ll always have a seat at the table,\u201d Cunningham said.\n\nThe table comment referred to Arrington telling a Republican mayor who backed Cunningham that his town would lose its seat at the table if he backed the Democrat. Isle of Palms Mayor Jimmy Carroll taped the conversation and released it to The Post and Courier of Charleston.\n\nArrington came after Sanford hard in the primary \u2014 one ad suggested he needed to spend more time getting things done than going on CNN and bashing Trump. It ended with a swipe about Sanford leaving South Carolina while governor in 2009 to meet a woman for an affair in Argentina. He told no one where he was going, and his in-the-dark staff suggested he might be hiking the Appalachian Trail.\n\n\u201cBless his heart. But it\u2019s time for Mark Sanford to take a hike \u2014 for real this time,\u201d Arrington said in her ad .\n\nArrington, 47, spoke to reporters Wednesday morning in the same hotel where 12 hours before she told supporters that she was only 30 minutes from winning.

GOP Gov. Rick Snyder couldn\u2019t run because he reached a two-term limit. Stabenow turned aside a challenge from Republican John James, a businessman and Iraq War veteran who was making his first bid for political office.\n\nDemocratic women ran against Republican male incumbents in two closely watched U.S. House races in eastern and southern Michigan. Three statewide ballot questions were approved, including one that legalizes recreational marijuana.\n\nHere are some key races:\n\nCONGRESS\n\nMichigan\u2019s delegation will be split 7-7 in January after Democrats knocked off a Republican incumbent and picked up an open seat that was held by the GOP. Former CIA analyst Elissa Slotkin defeated Rep. Mike Bishop in the 8th District after pounding him with TV ads highlighting his opposition to the Affordable Care Act. Democrat Haley Stevens, a key government staffer in the bailout of the auto industry, captured the 11th District over Republican businesswoman Lena Epstein. Democrat Rashida Tlaib won the 13th District to become one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, alongside Somali-American Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.\n\nLEGISLATURE\n\nDemocrats have long been outnumbered in the Michigan House and Senate. They\u2019re poised to make gains, though they conceded that Republicans will retain control of both houses. Republicans have benefited for years because they controlled how districts were drawn after the 2010 census. The GOP held majorities of 63-46 in the House and 27-10 in the Senate before Tuesday, with one Democratic-leaning seat in each chamber vacant.\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nRepublican Tom Leonard conceded a narrow defeat to Democrat Dana Nessel, although the AP has not called the race. Nessel is best known for representing two women who successfully challenged Michigan\u2019s ban on gay marriage. She has promised to shake up the attorney general\u2019s office, especially how it handles Flint water cases. She says the special prosecutor is overpaid and that criminal charges were influenced by politics. An independent candidate and the Libertarian Party nominee together got roughly 4 percent of the vote.\n\nSUPREME COURT\n\nThe two candidates with the most votes in the six-person race will get seats on Michigan\u2019s highest court. Justice Elizabeth Clement was in first place Wednesday with 94 percent of votes counted. Justice Kurtis Wilder and appellate lawyer Megan Cavanagh were battling for the second spot. Cavanagh, a Democrat, is the daughter of former Justice Michael Cavanagh. Republicans have a 5-2 majority on the Supreme Court, though candidates aren\u2019t identified by party on the ballot. University of Michigan law professor Sam Bagenstos, a Democrat, was far behind and threw in the towel.\n\nMARIJUANA\n\nMichigan residents age 21 or older now will be able to buy, grow and use marijuana for recreational purposes. The state legalized medical marijuana 10 years ago. The nonpartisan Citizens Research Council of Michigan says police and jails might save money by not arresting people, but it also notes there will be a cost for abuse and other public health issues. Marijuana sales will carry a special 10 percent tax, with 70 percent of revenue going to schools and roads, on top of Michigan\u2019s 6 percent sales tax.\n\nVOTING PROPOSAL\n\nProposal 3, which allows people to register to vote as late as Election Day and immediately get a ballot, easily passed. Absentee ballots will be granted without voters having to provide a reason they\u2019re requesting one. Straight-party voting \u2014 a single mark for candidates of one party \u2014 will also be revived. Supporters, including the American Civil Liberties Union, civil rights groups and unions, say it will make voting more accessible. Opponents included Republican secretary of state candidate Mary Treder Lang, who said some provisions will \u201cadd more bureaucracy, red tape and government regulations.\u201d\n\nDRAWING DISTRICTS\n\nVoters overhauled the way seats in the Legislature and Congress are drawn every decade. The job now will go to a 13-member commission picked at random after the next census. It\u2019s an extraordinary change now enshrined in the state constitution that snatches power from lawmakers and the governor. Republicans drew the maps after the 2010 census because they were in control of the state Capitol and have remained so, at least partly because of how those seats were drawn. Critics of the proposal say a commission won\u2019t be accountable to the public. Supporters, however, say representative democracy is at risk in a process soaked in politics.\n\n___\n\nFor the AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Mom gets 2 years in prison for forcing daughter to have sex\n\nSALEM, Mass.

(AP Photo/Larry Papke)\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Kevin Harvick\u2019s bid for a second NASCAR title suffered a massive setback when he was stripped of his berth in the championship race after series inspectors found his winning car from Texas Motor Speedway had been deliberately altered to give him a performance advantage.\n\nNASCAR said Wednesday night it believes Harvick\u2019s spoiler was intentionally offset to the right to give the Ford an aerodynamic advantage when he drove through the corners at Texas. NASCAR can\u2019t prove if Stewart-Haas Racing made its own spoiler or altered one from its manufacturer, but senior vice president of competition Scott Miller said the penalty is the same in either case.\n\nThe illegal spoiler was not found until the No. 4 Ford received a thorough inspection at NASCAR\u2019s Research and Development Center when it was returned to North Carolina after Sunday\u2019s race. An inspector at Texas thought the spoiler looked off, but Miller said it had to be removed from the car. Once that happened, it was \u201c100 percent, as black and white as it gets,\u201d Miller said.\n\nSpoilers will be checked at Phoenix this weekend, Miller said, and NASCAR will likely ramp up its penalties next year.\n\n\u201cWe need to change the culture to where we don\u2019t have to play this cat and mouse game with the teams,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting borderline ridiculous.\u201d\n\nThe whopping penalty negated the automatic berth Harvick earned into NASCAR\u2019s version of a final four. In addition to losing his spot in next weekend\u2019s finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, Harvick must also close out the final two races of the season without crew chief Rodney Childers and car chief Robert Smith. Both were suspended for two races. Childers also was fined $75,000.\n\nHarvick was docked 40 driver points, and Stewart-Haas Racing was docked 40 owner points as well. Harvick enters this weekend\u2019s race at Phoenix fourth among the remaining eight playoff drivers, three points above the cutline. Should there be a tie for the final transfer spot, Harvick would not be eligible to use the Texas victory in the tiebreaking procedure.\n\nGreg Zipadelli, vice president of competition at SHR, said the team will not appeal the penalties. Tony Gibson will be Harvick\u2019s interim crew chief and Nick DeFazio will be interim car chief.\n\n\u201cWe work tirelessly across every inch of our race cars to create speed and, unfortunately, NASCAR determined we ventured into an area not accommodated by its rule book,\u201d Zipadelli said. \u201cWe will not appeal the penalty. Instead, we will direct our immediate focus to this weekend\u2019s event in Phoenix and control our destiny on the racetrack.\u201d\n\nHarvick\u2019s win at Texas was his series-leading eighth of the year and qualified him for Homestead along with Joey Logano. Now, three spots in the finale will be up for grabs Sunday in Phoenix.\n\nHarvick won the 2014 Cup Series championship and went to Phoenix that season in a must-win situation to race for the title. He pulled it off and is a nine-time winner at Phoenix, including earlier this year.\n\nHarvick has been in NASCAR\u2019s finale three of the last four years.\n\nThe penalty is disastrous for SHR, which went into the third round of the playoffs with all four of its drivers eligible for the championship. Logano grabbed the first spot, which meant the best SHR could do was qualify three cars for Homestead. Now, SHR could wind up locked out of the finale outright if Harvick doesn\u2019t advance past Phoenix. Aric Almirola, Kurt Busch and Clint Bowyer are all below the cutline and likely need to win at Phoenix to advance.\n\nThe penalty against Harvick also closes a rough race for NASCAR, which erroneously penalized Jimmie Johnson moments before the race began. Johnson was sent to the back of the field because NASCAR believed his car failed inspection three times, but he had failed only twice.\n\nNASCAR announced the mistake during the race and said Monday it has updated its procedures to prevent a similar mistake moving forward. Later in the same event, Bowyer was penalized for a crew member being over the pit road wall too early. The crew member was sitting on the wall with his feet touching the asphalt on pit road, which was a violation, even if it seemed extreme.\n\nNow Harvick\u2019s team has been rocked by a penalty that may change the composition of the final four drivers racing for the title. Harvick, along with Kyle Busch and Martin Truex Jr., is part of NASCAR\u2019s so-called Big Three that dominated the season through a stretch of summer racing. All three were expected to race for the championship, and none is qualified for Homestead yet with one race remaining.\n\n\u201cIt is not our desire to issue any penalties, but we\u2019ll do so when necessary to ensure each race and championship is contested on a level playing field,\u201d Miller said earlier Wednesday. \u201cWe will now return our focus to Phoenix, and the battle for a championship.\u201d\n\nNASCAR later allowed Miller to answer questions about Harvick\u2019s penalty because of the magnitude of the situation. NASCAR had moved away in recent years from detailing infractions publicly.\n\nAlso Wednesday, NASCAR penalized the teams of Ryan Blaney and Erik Jones, who already have been eliminated from the playoffs.\n\nBlaney crew chief Jeremy Bullins was fined $50,000, and car chief Kirk Almquist was suspended for the next two races. Jones crew chief Chris Gayle was fined $50,000 and car chief Jason Overstreet was suspended the next two races.\n\nIt took until Wednesday for the penalties to be announced because the cars were in transit Monday from Texas to North Carolina. Inspection was on Tuesday, and the teams do the actual teardown themselves. Once the Harvick violation was discovered late Tuesday, NASCAR had to examine whether the violation was correct and didn\u2019t release its findings until the next day \u2014 two days before Harvick and his interim crew chief and car chief will practice at Phoenix.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "SAN RAFAEL, Calif.

Along with providing tools that allow employees to track their spending and save money, Even features Instapay, which allows users to advance some of their next paycheck up to 13 days before payday. (AP Photo/Michael Ainsworth, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Americans take out roughly $50 billion in payday loans a year, each racking up hundreds of dollars in fees and interest. But a small and growing service that allows its users to take an advance on their paycheck might be giving the payday loan industry a run for its money.\n\nSan Francisco-based financial technology company Even made headlines late last year when Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest private employer, announced it would start offering Even\u2019s service as part of its employee benefits package. Along with providing tools that allow employees to track their spending and save money, Even features Instapay, which allows users to advance some of their next paycheck up to 13 days before payday. Because the Even user is tapping into his or her already accumulated hours, Even doesn\u2019t charge the employee interest on the advance.\n\nEven is one of a handful of technology companies have popped up in recent years looking to get wages to employees faster and on demand. Companies like FlexWage Solutions and Instant Financial offer on-demand pay, but those services are often tied to a debit card issued by the company instead of an employee\u2019s primary bank account.\n\nEven founder Jon Schlossberg has said publicly that part of the company\u2019s mission is to put the payday loan industry out of business, claiming it exploits the financially vulnerable. He shared internal usage data exclusively with The Associated Press that shows, at least preliminarily, that Even users are less likely to tap the payday loan market once they sign up for the company\u2019s services.\n\n\u201cYou have this entire industry of financial institutions taking advantage of Americans struggling to live paycheck to paycheck, and payday lenders are really the most predatory,\u201d Schlossberg said.\n\nPayday lenders say they provide a necessary service, with many Americans unable to come up with cash to cover an unexpected financial emergency. They also say they lend to the country\u2019s most desperate, who are often the highest risk for not paying back the loan. But critics say the rates and fees are exorbitant and can trap the borrower in a cycle of debt that can last months.

The data is also limited by the fact that Walmart, by far its biggest customer, only started using the product on December 15, 2017. Schlossberg said the company is working with academic researchers on the efficacy of Even\u2019s Instapay product versus payday loan usage, with the goal of publishing sometime in 2019.\n\nWalmart is the only company that publicly says it uses Even, but an Even spokesman says it has \u201cmore than\u201d 10 companies signed up currently, with 400,000 active subscribers.

That's why there's so much resistance to broadcasting female sports, especially soccer,\" said 19-year-old wingback. (AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko)\n\nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 In a country where the soccer conversation is overwhelmingly dominated by talk of Lionel Messi and Diego Maradona, female players in Argentina struggle to be heard.\n\nThat\u2019s changing rapidly, however, and it\u2019s partly because of a picture that was widely shared on social media.\n\nThe photo, taken in April before a Women\u2019s Copa America match in Chile, showed the Argentine players with their hands cupped behind their right ears, a sign of protest highlighting that no one was listening to them. It took social media to spread the message because the traditional media, including Argentina\u2019s top TV channels and newspapers, didn\u2019t even cover the continental championship.\n\n\u201cWe live in a soccer-mad country but with a lot of machismo,\u201d Argentina forward Belen Potassa said at the national team\u2019s training grounds on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. \u201cSoccer is Messi, (Gonzalo) Higuain, (Diego) Maradona and no one else.\u201d\n\nWhile those players are adored and even idolized, the women\u2019s team has been sidelined \u2014 just like in other countries around the world.\n\nThe Argentine soccer federation often is late in paying travel expenses while the players have routinely faced the prejudices of a chauvinistic society that sees soccer as a men\u2019s only game. Still, the long-disadvantaged team of women may be on the verge of a game changer by defying long-established gender inequalities and proving themselves on and off the field.\n\nBy finishing third at the Copa America, the team in the light blue-and-white striped shirts earned a place in the playoffs for this year\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup in France. Argentina will play Panama on Thursday for a spot in the 24-team tournament. For the first time in the country\u2019s women\u2019s soccer history, the game will be played at a sold out stadium in Buenos Aires.\n\nAnother major achievement came in practice.\n\nThe women\u2019s team was recently allowed to train at the same complex where Messi and the rest of the men\u2019s team prepare for games, grounds that until recently were reserved for men only.\n\n\u201cWomen fight since they\u2019re born because we don\u2019t have the same rights as men. But in sports the sacrifice is twice as tough. They don\u2019t pay you, the clothes are not the same, the sponsors are not the same,\u201d said Potassa, who recently signed a contract with a well-known sports brand that supplies her with boots and clothing.\n\nThe women\u2019s team\u2019s progress has even received the support of Messi and several Argentine professional clubs that have promoted the playoff game against Panama on social media under the motto: \u201cIt\u2019s time to root for them.\u201d\n\nMany female players say they feel part of a cultural change driven by the country\u2019s strong feminist movement, which has mobilized tens of thousands to fight against violence against women, and helped them gain ground in politics and the workplace.\n\nBut to gain equality, there is still a long way to go.\n\nWhile the men\u2019s league draws huge crowds and brings in millions of dollars, female players are amateurs and get about 3,000 pesos (about $82) for travel expenses at a first division club. If a woman plays for the national team, she\u2019ll earn 300 pesos ($8) a day.\n\nThat forces players to split their time between soccer and a second job to survive, said Potassa, who is also a receptionist at a local college.\n\nVeteran goalkeeper Vanina Correa, the only mother in the national team, said the hardest part is being away from her children, Romeo and Luna. The 4-year-old twins stay with their grandmother while Correa trains for the playoff more than 185 miles (300 kilometers) from home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to be here,\u201d said Correa, who doubles as a municipal employee. \u201cI\u2019m always thinking about home and wondering what they\u2019re doing and if they\u2019re behaving.\n\n\u201cIt would be more comfortable if we could live off soccer. I don\u2019t have much left (in my career) but we\u2019re fighting for the girls who are coming next.\u201d\n\nThat fight has been going on all over the world.\n\nAhead of the last Women\u2019s World Cup in 2015, a group of international players protested because the tournament was scheduled to be played on artificial turf, which is considered by many to be inferior to the real grass that has always been used in the men\u2019s game.\n\nThe tournament in Canada went on to be a huge success: It attracted the biggest crowds of any FIFA tournament outside of a men\u2019s World Cup and broke TV rating records in North America, with the final drawing more viewers than any other prior men\u2019s or women\u2019s match in the United States.\n\nFollowing their victory over Japan for the trophy, the U.S. women went on to campaign for, and receive, a better contract with U.S. Soccer that brought them closer to the compensation level of their male counterparts. The Americans were not alone. National teams from other countries also won more equitable contracts with their federations, including Australia and Ireland.\n\nBut in Argentina, that kind of change still seems far away and female soccer players must join leagues in neighboring Brazil, Europe or the United States to make a living from the sport.\n\nOne of the major obstacles they face is the lack of attention. It wasn\u2019t until this year that a non-sports TV channel finally began broadcasting league games.\n\n\u201cWomen are not accepted in this environment yet. That\u2019s why there\u2019s so much resistance to broadcasting female sports, especially soccer,\u201d said 19-year-old wingback Luana Munoz, who also plays for Tyler Junior College in Texas. \u201cIt has to be promoted, people need to know that it is being played, they need to know the name of the players, and the tournament has to be competitive.\u201d\n\nInternationally, FIFA has made a point of proclaiming that it aims to raise both the role of women in the governing body and the profile of the women\u2019s game. Fatma Samoura was appointed the organization\u2019s first female secretary general in 2016, and a women\u2019s soccer division was created.\n\nIn Argentina, the development taking place in local women\u2019s soccer is a recent phenomenon.\n\n\u201cWhen we asked our youngest daughter what sport she wanted to practice, she said soccer. She ended up playing hockey,\u201d said Ricardo Pinela, president of the Argentine federation\u2019s women\u2019s soccer committee. \u201cThe first step is that the girls have the possibility to kick a ball in front of their house. This will generate the development of female soccer and we will see equality in the number of men and women playing the game.\u201d\n\nThe inequality faced by the Argentines is seen in countries throughout South America, including Chile, which has already qualified for the World Cup. The only exception perhaps is Brazil, where six-time world player of the year Marta has given the women\u2019s game a platform for success.\n\n\u2033(Men\u2019s) professional clubs don\u2019t carry the responsibility or care about granting the girls the most basic work conditions,\u201d said Freddy Contreras, who is in charge of the female team at Colo Colo, the most popular club in Chile.\n\nContreras said clubs don\u2019t lend women fields for training and only supply them with one set of shirts.\n\nThe Argentine women\u2019s team only was given access to the men\u2019s training ground after its poor working conditions became publicly known.\n\n\u201cThese are things that we didn\u2019t have before,\u201d Munoz said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t give us the same status but it gets us close. We\u2019re being given the same place as the professionals. That\u2019s very important to us, even if it\u2019s small, even if it\u2019s a detail.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Eva Vergara in Santiago, Chile, and AP Sports Writer Anne M.

(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Nearly a year after Courtney Jackson launched her clothing business, she took on a partner to help manage the company\u2019s growth. A month into the partnership, something was wrong.\n\nJackson\u2019s partner was supposed to handle half the company\u2019s workload, but that didn\u2019t happen. So, Jackson began taking on more of the responsibilities. When Jackson tried to discuss the division of work, \u201cshe was a little defensive at first, and asked me to be patient.\u201d The situation didn\u2019t improve, and they agreed to part at the end of last year, just three months after the partnership began. But under their partnership agreement, drawn up without an attorney, dividing the company\u2019s assets would have weakened it financially. The partners decided to close, and Jackson lost her company.\n\nThe failure of a partnership often brings hard lessons for company owners. Problems often start when prospective partners don\u2019t think through all the ramifications of what they\u2019re doing \u2014 including whether they\u2019ll be a good fit. They may not be clear on their expectations for each other, and how they\u2019ll resolve conflicts. And they may not consider the legal consequences of how they set up their partnership, and how difficult it might be to unwind it; rather than hire an attorney, they write their own agreement that can be problematic when the relationship turns sour.\n\nJackson\u2019s experience taught her that she needed to be more strategic in her business decisions. And in choosing a partner \u2014 Jackson had met hers through a mutual acquaintance,\n\n\u201cYou need to make sure you know the person well enough to know what their strengths are and their weaknesses,\u201d says Jackson, who lost her enthusiasm for retailing after the company closed. She now is the sole owner of an information technology company in Tampa, Florida.\n\nOwners are so caught up in the idea of finding a partner to get investment money, help and expertise that they don\u2019t do the kind of due diligence they would do before hiring an employee, says Michael Howard, a management professor at Texas A&M University\u2019s Mays Business School.\n\n\u201cWhat will happen when you grow? What\u2019s your process for resolving problems? How should we manage this project? If you ask these kind of questions, it could reveal a lot of problems in advance,\u201d Howard says.\n\nWhile partnering with strangers has potential pitfalls, so does going into business with friends.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to have trust and strong social ties, but if maintaining them comes at the loss of business success, that\u2019s not really appropriate,\u201d Howard says.\n\nPartners also need to be sure they share the same goals for the business, or at least understand what their differences are.\n\n\u201cYou need to talk up front about what your expectations are, for long term, short term, two-year and five-year picture,\u201d says Sandy Jap, a marketing professor at Emory University\u2019s Goizueta Business School who has done research into partner selection. She suggests owners talk to other people who have worked with their prospective partners, in much the same way they\u2019d check a job candidate\u2019s references.\n\nLisa Shepherd needed cash to help her marketing business grow, so she gave three employees equity stakes. Within two years, the deal went bad as the four owners argued over whether to reinvest earnings into the business or distribute the profits among the partners. They also disagreed about workloads \u2014 \u201ceach person thought that he or she was working incredibly hard, while the others weren\u2019t,\u201d says Shepherd, owner of The Mezzanine Group, based in Toronto.\n\nOne point of contention came as the partners who did the day-to-day work accused Shepherd of going out for lunch too often rather than working although those meetings led to new business.\n\n\u201cMy work was outside the company, networking, opening doors,\u201d Shepherd says. They thought, \u2018she\u2019s having a grand old time and not doing any work.\u2019\u201d\n\nShepherd did have an attorney draw up a partnership agreement at the start, ultimately the \u201cbest business decision ever, worth its weight in gold,\u201d because it took just two months to end the partnership. Since she held a 55 percent stake, Shepherd was able to buy her partners out and retain ownership. Still, she says, \u201cit was emotionally devastating. I had thought that everything would go well and having partners in the business would be utopia.\u201d\n\nToday Shepherd is a sole proprietor. She has a profit-sharing plan for her general manager but doesn\u2019t plan to bring on another partner.\n\nEven when a partnership is long-lived, there can be hard lessons \u2014 among them, facing the fact that the partnership doesn\u2019t work anymore.\n\n\u201cYou need to get good at saying goodbye when the value in the relationship does end,\u201d says Jap, the Emory professor. A breakup may be necessary even if the company is successful.\n\nAntonio Argibay\u2019s partnership lasted more than 30 years, but during its last decade, the partners no longer agreed about the direction the architectural firm should take. But breaking up was difficult.\n\n\u201cIt was always, things are too tough, there\u2019s a downturn, or things are going great. It was never the right time,\u201d says Argibay, now the sole proprietor of New York-based Meridian Design Associates.\n\nFinally, in 2013, they decided Argibay should buy his partner out, but it still took six months for them and their attorneys to work out the details. One problem was the fact the partners had a 50-50 split. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to break a tie. Someone has to withdraw, win or lose,\u201d Agibay says.\n\nHis takeaway from his partnership: \u201cWithout a clear, shared vision, the business was not going to survive.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nFor more small business news, insights and inspiration, sign up for our free weekly newsletter here: http://discover.ap.org/ssb\n\n_____\n\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

An aggressive campaign to define and demonize new congressional committee leaders. The rise of a new foil for President Donald Trump to attack.\n\nWith Democrats seizing control of the House, Republicans for the first time in the Trump era will no longer hold sway in all branches of the federal government. The new, split reality that Washington woke up to on Wednesday poses stark challenges for the White House, but also presents some political opportunities. Aides had been quietly prepared for this outcome for weeks and will now kick into overdrive before the new Congress takes office in January.\n\nThe first move likely belongs to Democrats. With their takeover of the House fueled by anti-Trump energy coursing through their supporters, Democrats now face expectations from their constituents to torment Trump, using their newly acquired power of the subpoena to launch a series of investigations into matters like the president\u2019s business dealings and potential Cabinet-member corruption while also trying to unearth Trump\u2019s tax returns.\n\nThere also could be pressure to impeach Trump, though chances of removal from office by a Republican-controlled Senate are remote. The president welcomed that fight, declaring the White House would adopt \u201ca warlike posture.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that happens, then we\u2019re going to do the same thing, and government comes to a halt,\u201d Trump said Wednesday at a combative, free-wheeling White House news conference. \u201cBut they can play that game, but we can play it better, because we have a thing called the United States Senate.\u201d\n\nAs polls showed for months that the Democrats were likely to flip the House, covert work began in the West Wing to prepare for a new, more contested chapter of the Trump presidency. Though no formal war room was established, senior aides convened meetings to map out the administration\u2019s strategy for combating newly emboldened Democrats. Trump himself at times took part in informal conversations about the future, according to two senior White House officials not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.\n\nThe central strategy: play defense by going on offense and turning the public against Democratic investigations by painting the probes as overreach designed to cause gridlock.\n\nWest Wing aides are bracing for a number of investigations, including probes into whether Trump\u2019s business was profiting off his presidency and looking at his administration\u2019s move to separate migrant children from their families. Turnover in the White House counsel\u2019s office \u2014 Don McGahn has departed and his replacement, Pat Cipollone, has not started yet \u2014 has slowed some planning for how to confront legal challenges. But politically, West Wing aides and outside surrogates will make the case that the Democrats are abusing the power of the subpoena, a task that began as the votes were still being tallied late Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that there will be much of an appetite for Democrat lawmakers to spend all of their time, or most of their time or even a fraction of their time, investigating, instigating, trying to impeach and subpoena people,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser, told reporters on the White House driveway. \u201cYou have to really give the voters what they want.\u201d\n\nRepublicans will surely make likely House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a target of their ire, and Trump didn\u2019t waste time noting Wednesday that Pelosi in the speaker\u2019s job could be good for Republican political prospects. If restive House Democrats \u201cgive her a hard time, perhaps we will add some Republican votes. She has earned this great honor!\u201d Trump said in a tweet.\n\nBeyond Pelosi, the GOP also will run aggressive ad campaigns and unleash talking-point attacks against the committee leaders who will run the probes. Those potentially include Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York atop the Judiciary Committee and Elijah Cummings of Maryland, incoming chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nOne of the senior West Wing aides said the White House goal will be to make those congressional leaders \u201cfamous for all the wrong reasons.\u201d\n\nTrump himself will likely get involved, assigning derogatory nicknames while savaging them on Twitter, the aide said. The Democratic-controlled chamber will also provide a foil for Trump, who is at his most comfortable when he has a natural opponent.\n\nThe White House also could attempt to link the Democratic investigative efforts \u2014 particularly if they prove unpopular \u2014 to the party\u2019s presidential candidates, the aides said. Democrats, emboldened by their victory and rising momentum, feel confident they can withstand the White House assaults in order to weaken the president before his re-election bid kicks into high gear.\n\nNewt Gingrich, a Trump ally who served as House speaker during Republican efforts to investigate and impeach President Bill Clinton, urged the White House to cooperate with Democratic probes \u2014 but ever so slowly.\n\n\u201cThe White House should drag it out, bog it down, take the momentum away and make it go on forever,\u201d said Gingrich. He also encouraged conservatives to foster what he believes would be counter-productive impeachment talk among Democrats. \u201cMake it the speaker\u2019s problem, make her deal with the nutty wing of her party.\u201d\n\nSome in Trump\u2019s orbit would relish an impeachment battle, pointing to how the 1998 battle backfired on Republicans. They were seen as overreaching, and that helped boost Clinton\u2019s poll numbers.\n\nGingrich added that Trump should \u201cspend 2019 governing\u201d and that includes trying to work with Democrats on certain issues that could generate support on both sides of the aisle or perhaps leaving Democrats with the blame if the effort falls apart. White House aides sounded a note of pessimism that a sweeping legislative deal on immigration or infrastructure could be struck but thought there could be bipartisan energy on issues like criminal justice reform and opioids.\n\nThe White House also believes that much of what it wants to do can move forward in 2019 despite the Democrats\u2019 capture of the House because Republicans still control the Senate.\n\nWhite House aides are expecting a number of high-profile departures from the administration, including from the Cabinet, and replacements should have an easier time with confirmation with the Senate still in GOP hands. Moreover, keeping Republicans in charge of the Senate will allow Trump to continue with his flood of federal judicial appointments and allow him to make progress on trade deals, which will be a centerpiece of 2019.\n\n___\n\nFollow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire", "Democrat Laura Kelly waved to the crowd at the Ramada Hotel and Convention Center in Topeka after she won election Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, to become the next Kansas governor.

After Republican Bob Stefanowski called him Wednesday morning to concede the race, Lamont said he spoke with Democratic and Republican leaders of the General Assembly, telling them \u201cmy door is open and any good idea, let\u2019s go with it.\u201d\n\nLamont has already begun forming a business advisory council and plans to announce a transition team later in the week.\n\nElection results show the state is divided. With 95 percent of precincts reporting, Lamont received 49 percent of the vote, while Stefanowski garnered 47 percent. Independent Oz Griebel won 4 percent. In January, Lamont will fill the job being vacated by two-term Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who has had strained relations at times with state lawmakers from both parties and suffers from low public approval ratings. He\u2019ll also take on an electorate frustrated by successive years of budget deficits and fiscal challenges.\n\nBut Senate President Martin Looney of New Haven dismissed some of those concerns Wednesday, pointing to large Democratic gains in the General Assembly.\n\nLooney said it appeared that Democrats will now control 24 seats in the 36-member Senate, which has had an even split of 18-to-18 with Republicans. In the House of Representatives, House Speaker Joe Aresimowicz said it appeared Democrats will now control 92 of the 151 seats, compared to the current 80 seats.\n\n\u201cWe take that as a mandate of the (Democrats\u2019) policies,\u201d he said, adding how he looks forward to working with Lamont on a phased-in $15 an hour minimum wage, \u201cchanges in tax policy,\u201d tolls on tractor trailers and possibly other vehicles, and a statewide car tax plan that would replace the current system of town-by-town taxes.\n\nWhile disappointed with the election outcome, Stefanowski, a former General Electric and UBS Investment Bank executive, said he was pleased with his campaign\u2019s success in drawing attention to the tax burden in the state. He repeatedly called for the eventual elimination of the personal income tax and the end to various other state taxes, saying it was the only way to jumpstart Connecticut\u2019s economy. Lamont warned such a move would decimate state services.\n\nStefanowski also focused much of the campaign accusing Lamont of supporting the continuation of Malloy\u2019s policies, a move Malloy called \u201cstupid\u201d on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWhoever had the idea that you should run against someone who is leaving, and that was your sole strategy for winning, didn\u2019t really think it out too well, quite frankly,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that person was paid money, they should have to repay it.\u201d\n\nLamont\u2019s win completed a Democratic sweep of the top offices on the ballot in Connecticut, including the re-election of U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy. Once again, there are five Democrats representing the state in the U.S. House, including a newcomer, former national teacher of the year Jahana Hayes.\n\nDuring the campaign, Lamont painted Stefanowski and Trump as threats to everything from public education to the rights of organized labor and women.\n\n\u201cI see all that stuff coming out of Washington, D.C.,\u201d Lamont recently told a group of retired teachers. \u201cI just want you to know that a governor can be a firewall there.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s victory marked Lamont\u2019s first major electoral win. He lost the 2010 Democratic primary for governor to Malloy, who did not seek a third term in office. But Lamont is better known for defeating U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman in the 2006 Democratic primary, embodying voter opposition to the war in Iraq. Lamont ultimately lost the general election when Lieberman ran as an independent.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "BIRMINGHAM, Ala.

He previously served as district attorney on an interim basis. He defeated white Republican Mike Anderton, who was appointed to the position last year.\n\nDuring the campaign, Carr tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that our limited resources should be devoted to jailing individuals for marijuana possession instead of focusing on serious violent crimes.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union highlighted Carr\u2019s approach as being part of a national push for criminal justice reform.\n\nIn subsequent interviews, Carr said changes were needed to ease jail overcrowding. Alabama prisons held about 22,000 inmates in July while they were designed to hold about 13,000 people, a state report showed.\n\nSaying that proposals to arm educational administrators and teachers aren\u2019t an answer to school shootings, Pettway said he would seek funding to put deputies with tactical training in each school. He also advocated for additional educational opportunities for jail prisoners and closer relations between police and community groups.\n\nIn conceding the race, Hale said Pettway \u201cis going to be a good sheriff.\u201d\n\nOnce a violent hotbed of racial segregation and now a landmark of civil rights history, Birmingham endured decades of population decline because of white flight that has stabilized in recent years, Census figures show.

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., greets supporters after she was declared the winner over former Gov. Phil Bredesen in their race for the U.S. Senate Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Franklin, Tenn. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Tennessee Democrats began Election Day feeling like they had their best chance in years to regain some political clout in their conservative state.\n\nThose aspirations quickly disappeared, as voters turned out in droves largely to give President Donald Trump a stamp of approval and echo much of what Republicans touted on the campaign trail.\n\nFrom the U.S. Senate to the governor\u2019s office to the statehouse, Republicans were able to fend off key Democratic challengers, despite running in a year that was expected to see a large swell of progressive voters across the country.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn delivered the biggest blow to Democrats by handily defeating their popular former governor, Phil Bredesen, in a Senate bid to replace retiring Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who had frequently clashed with the president.\n\nOne reason for the Republican success, according to a wide-ranging survey of Tennessee voters, was that voters were pleased with how things are going under Trump.\n\nAP VoteCast found that slightly more than half of Tennessee voters said the country is on the right track, compared with a little less than half who said the country is headed in the wrong direction. Roughly six in 10 Tennessee voters said they approve of the job Trump is doing, and about four in 10 said they strongly approve.\n\nTennessee voters were also happy with the country\u2019s economic outlook, with 75 percent saying the nation\u2019s economy is good.\n\nAP VoteCast is a nationwide survey of about 138,000 voters and nonvoters conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nThe high-profile U.S. Senate race attracted national attention, as control of the chamber hung in the balance. Ultimately Tennessean voters chose Blackburn \u2014 who proudly aligned herself Trump at every opportunity \u2014 over Bredesen.\n\nIn her victory speech, Blackburn thanked Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who made their third visits to Tennessee on Sunday to boost her. She said she will be a leader who will \u201cwork with the president and keep this nation on the path to prosperity that we are on today.\u201d\n\nBredesen had hoped his moderate approach to the open position would be enough to sway independent and GOP voters his way. It was the first time the Democrats had nominated a competitive candidate for the seat in recent years, with many gambling that Bredesen\u2019s statewide popularity and willingness to stray from his own political party could outpace Blackburn\u2019s Republican favorability in a growing GOP-dominant state. Bredesen was likely the only Democrat who would have had a shot in the contest.\n\nBy early Tuesday evening, those hopes were quickly dashed. Blackburn emerged as the victor not long after Republican businessman Bill Lee was named the winner against former Democratic Nashville Mayor Karl Dean in his bid to be the state\u2019s next governor.\n\nThe wins trickled down to the statehouse, where Republican supermajorities looked safely intact. State Senate GOP Speaker Randy McNally declared a clean sweep for Republicans in his chamber\u2019s slate of elections, and House Republicans appear to have only lost one net seat to Democrats.\n\nVoters also were firmly interested in immigration, which became a rallying call by Blackburn and Trump down the midterm homestretch. In the survey, voters considered immigration and health care important by about a quarter each; the economy, at a margin of about 2 in 10; and terrorism and gun policy, both less than 1 in 10.\n\nBredesen hinted at his possible loss in an interview just days before Tuesday\u2019s election, pointing out that he disagreed with the direction of the national Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cIf I lose, I think it will just be because the national Democratic brand is a problem in general for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI think my party is at its best when it gets out of this elitist stuff.\u201d\n\nTennessee Democratic Party Chair Mary Mancini said in a statement on Wednesday that candidates made gains in the state by narrowing margins significantly in races that haven\u2019t been competitive in decades.\n\nShe said the party still has work to do, \u201cbut there is no doubt that now we have a stronger foundation upon which to build.\u201d\n\nDemocrats made no gains in the nine races for the U.S. House of Representatives in Tennessee, including three open seats retained by Republicans.\n\nAll six House incumbents cruised to victory to maintain the party breakdown status quo: seven Republicans, two Democrats.", "FILE- In this Oct. 7, 2018, file photo, Oakland Raiders defensive end Bruce Irvin, center, reacts after sacking Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers during the first half of an NFL football game in Carson, Calif.

He said he has no timetable on Jones being cleared for a game.\n\nThe Falcons (4-4) have won three straight despite losing starting safeties Ricardo Allen and Keanu Neal to season-ending injuries. Starting guards Andy Levitre and Brando Fusco and running back Devonta Freeman also are on IR.\n\nIrvin played with Seattle when Quinn was the team\u2019s defensive coordinator.\n\nIrvin had three sacks with Oakland, but played only nine snaps in a 34-3 loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Thursday night.\n\nIrvin (6-3, 250) played four seasons with Seattle before joining the Raiders in 2016. He had eight sacks as a rookie in 2012 and matched that career high with Oakland in 2017.\n\nHe set a career high with six forced fumbles in 2016. His 11 forced fumbles since the start of the 2016 season are the most in the NFL in that span.\n\nFor his career, Irvin has 40 sacks and 15 forced fumbles.\n\nOakland was expected to enter the season with Irvin and Khalil Mack leading the defense as bookend pass rushers.\n\nInstead, Mack was traded to Chicago a week before the season for a package of draft picks following a lengthy holdout.

Democrats flipped seats in suburban districts outside of Washington, Philadelphia, Miami, Chicago and Denver. Democrats also reclaimed a handful of blue-collar districts carried by both former President Barack Obama and Trump.\n\nThe results were more mixed deeper into Trump country.\n\nIn Kansas, Democrat Sharice Davids beat a GOP incumbent to become the first gay Native American woman elected to the House. But in Kentucky, one of the top Democratic recruits, retired Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath, lost her bid to oust to three-term Rep.

In a tweet Wednesday, he referred to the election results as a \u201cBig Victory.\u201d\n\nHistory was working against the president in both the House and the Senate.

Twenty-five percent described health care and immigration as the most important issues in the election.\n\nNearly two-thirds said Trump was a reason for their vote.\n\nThe president bet big on a xenophobic closing message, warning of an immigrant \u201cinvasion\u201d that promised to spread violent crime and drugs across the nation.

Critics said it doesn\u2019t address the larger issue of dwindling food supply and it would be devastating for the industry.\n\nThe proposed moratorium would not apply to boats viewing other whales in the region, including gray or transient whales.\n\nThe endangered orcas struggle from pollution, boat noise and lack of chinook salmon, which have been declining because of dams, habitat loss and overfishing.\n\nThe task force plans to forward its recommendations to the governor next week. He\u2019ll consider the ideas as he proposes a budget and potential legislation that will also go before the Legislature.\n\nAmong the more contentious ideas, the task force is recommending that the state set up a stakeholder process to address issues related to the possible breaching or removal of the four Snake River dams in eastern Washington.\n\nSome argue the best way to get more salmon to the starving whales is to tear down four dams on the lower Snake River, a tributary of the Columbia River, to help migrating fish.\n\nCritics say doing so would hurt the livelihood of many who depend on those dams for navigation, recreation and hydropower.\n\nThe group also recommended spilling more water over Columbia and Snake river dams when juvenile salmon are migrating so they can avoid harm going through the turbines.\n\nOther recommendations include supporting legislation before Congress that would make it easier for Washington, Idaho, Oregon and tribes to kill more sea lions and seals in the lower Columbia River.\n\nOther proposals being forwarded: Establishing an emergency rescue tug to response to potential oil spills off San Juan Island; protect habitat for chinook salmon and the smaller forage fish that they eat; and boost production of hatchery chinook salmon preferred by the orcas.\n\nBrian Goodremont, representing the Pacific Whale Watch Association, told others on the task force Tuesday that a moratorium on watching the endangered orcas would be devastating financially to the industry, cost jobs and hurt a lot of people.\n\n\u201cTalking about prohibitions is the nuclear option for us,\u201d he said.\n\n____\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify that the proposed moratorium would apply only to boats watching the critically endangered population of orcas.", "TUCSON, Ariz.

She contributed to all five previous titles, reaching fourth place among players with the most Fed Cup trophies.\n\nKvitova returned to the team this year after recovering from injuries she suffered during a knife attack at her home in December 2016 and won all her four singles matches on the way to the 3-1 victory over Switzerland in the first round and a 4-1 win over Germany in the semifinals.\n\nKvitova won five WTA tournaments in the first half of the year but lost all her group matches at the WTA Finals in Singapore last month.\n\nThe Czechs have the No. 1 doubles pair of Katerina Siniakova and Barbora Krejcikova, and also 33rd-ranked Barbora Strycova available.\n\nSiniakova, ranked 31st, is expected to play both singles and doubles.\n\n\u201cI just try to work this week to be ready,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Czechs have never beaten the Americans in the Fed Cup.

One winning constitutional amendment that attracted intense support across the political spectrum will require unanimous jury verdicts for all felony convictions.\n\nSECRETARY OF STATE\n\nVoters whittled down the competition to be Louisiana\u2019s next secretary of state from nine to two contenders, including a Democrat who wasn\u2019t the favored candidate of her party.\n\nThe winner of the December runoff will complete the remaining year of the term of Republican Tom Schedler, who resigned in May amid allegations he sexually harassed an employee.

But she focused on low-expense efforts, traveling to speak at small forums, luncheons and other events and seeking support among African-American voters.\n\nRepublicans who ran but didn\u2019t make the runoff included Turkey Creek Mayor Heather Cloud, former state Sen.

Scalise is the House\u2019s third-ranking Republican while Richmond is chairman of the influential Congressional Black Caucus. Both are expected to remain in prominent positions next term.\n\nIn his first term in office, Higgins overcame the most challengers, with six contenders trying to oust him from the district representing southwest and south central Louisiana. He was also the only Louisiana congressman to face an intra-party fight.\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS\n\nThere were six proposals to change the Louisiana Constitution.\n\nVoters approved Amendment 1 to make convicted state felons wait five years after serving their sentences before they can run for office in Louisiana, unless they are pardoned.\n\nVoters approved Amendment 2 to end a Jim Crow-era law that allows split juries to convict people of serious felony crimes. Louisiana was one of two states that permitted non-unanimous verdicts in felony cases. Starting Jan. 1, all felony jury verdicts will have to be unanimous to convict.\n\nVoters approved Amendment 3 to authorize local government agencies to share equipment and staff for a specific activity if they have a written agreement, without any compensation needing to be exchanged.\n\nVoters approved Amendment 4 to prohibit use of money from Louisiana\u2019s Transportation Trust Fund, which contains state gasoline and fuel tax income, to pay for state police operations. Instead, the money will only be spent on road, bridge, port and airport work.\n\nVoters approved Amendment 5 to extend Louisiana\u2019s special property tax assessments for the elderly, disabled veterans and surviving spouses of people in the military, law enforcement, firefighters and emergency medical technicians who die in the line of duty to homes placed in a trust.\n\nVoters approved Amendment 6 to require a four-year phase-in of higher property taxes when a tax assessor\u2019s reappraisal boosts a home\u2019s value by more than 50 percent. The change won\u2019t apply if the home is sold or its value was bumped up by construction or upgrades.\n\nFANTASY SPORTS\n\nVoters decided on a parish-by-parish basis whether to legalize cash-league fantasy sports contests through online sites such as DraftKings and FanDuel.\n\nWith fantasy sports websites, people can create imaginary teams of real-life sports players and score points based on how those players perform in actual games. The sites charge an entry fee and offer payouts to winners.\n\nLouisiana is one of nine states that haven\u2019t allowed online fantasy sports betting.

Thousands of nationalists marched in Warsaw on Poland's Independence Day holiday, taking part in an event that was organized by far-right groups. (AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski)\n\nWARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 The mayor of Warsaw on Wednesday banned radical Polish nationalists from marching on the 100th anniversary of Poland\u2019s independence due to security concerns. The move prompted Polish leaders to quickly draw up plans for an inclusive march Sunday that could be embraced by all citizens.\n\nIt was a significant about-face for the populist government, which has been trying not to alienate far-right voters but then faced the strong possibility that the main news from Poland on its centennial would have been about extremists or even violence. It seemed the Warsaw mayor, normally a political rival from the opposition centrist Civic Platform, offered them a way out of their predicament.\n\nMayor Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz said she wanted to put a stop to the extremist displays that have appeared yearly on Poland\u2019s Nov. 11 Independence Day holiday at far-right marches that have drawn tens of thousands to the capital.\n\nAt last year\u2019s march, some marchers carried racist and anti-Islamic banners calling for a \u201cWhite Europe\u201d and displayed white supremacist symbols like the Celtic Cross. There were also cases of violence against counter-protesters.\n\nThe event drew heavy media coverage and international criticism.\n\nLawmakers in the European Parliament called the participants \u201cfascists\u201d \u2014 a label that infuriated the conservative Polish government, whose leaders said most people marched with the national flag and without the racist banners. They mostly praised the march as an expression of patriotism, with one minister calling it a \u201cbeautiful sight.\u201d\n\nThis year, Poland is celebrating the centenary of its independence, gained in 1918 at the end of World War I.\n\n\u201cThis is not how the celebrations should look on the 100th anniversary of regaining our independence,\u201d Gronkiewicz-Waltz told a news conference. \u201cWarsaw has suffered enough because of aggressive nationalism.\u201d\n\nGronkiewicz-Waltz noted that the chief organizer of the Warsaw far-right march is a leader of the National Radical Camp, which traces its roots to an anti-Semitic movement of the 1930s. She said she has asked the government to outlaw it but has been ignored.\n\n\u201cThe capital city saved the honor of the country,\u201d the liberal daily Gazeta Wyborcza wrote.\n\nMany other Poles have resented how the nationalists in recent years have managed to draw so much attention on Independence Day, overshadowing other celebrations.\n\nPresident Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki met after the mayor\u2019s announcement and announced that a march organized by the government would take place in Warsaw on Sunday instead. Presidential spokesman Blazej Spychalski invited all Poles to march with national flags to show that \u201cwe are one white-and-red team,\u201d a reference to the flag\u2019s colors.\n\nThe government had held failed talks earlier with the far-right nationalists, hoping to make their march a state event, but far-right organizers refused the government demand that marchers could carry flags only, no banners, Morawiecki said.\n\nA similar ban on a far-right Independence Day march was announced Tuesday by the mayor of the western Polish city of Wroclaw, who cited the risk that participants might incite racial and ethnic hatred.\n\nThe bans followed signals that extremists from elsewhere in Europe planned to travel to Warsaw on Sunday.\n\nMass walk-outs by Polish police officers in recent days also raised concerns that clashes between participants and counter-protesters could get out of hand if there were not enough officers to intervene.\n\nMeanwhile, a controversial statue of the late President Lech Kaczynski was installed in a central Warsaw square ahead of its weekend unveiling as part of the centennial celebrations.\n\nKaczynski, who was killed in a 2010 plane crash in Russia, was the identical twin of Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of the right-wing Law and Justice party currently in power.\n\nWhile Poles have universally mourned the deaths of the president and the 95 other people who perished with him they remain divided on how to judge his presidency and whether he deserves such hero status.\n\nMore than 140 memorials to him already exist across the nation of 37 million people.\n\nAuthorities in Warsaw\u2019s local government opposed the statue and its central location. Pro-government provincial authorities were in favor. The clash is playing out in Poland\u2019s court system even as the 7-meter (23-foot) statue went up.\n\nThe end of World War I is also being marked on Sunday in Paris, where dozens of world leaders will gather, including host French President Emmanuel Macron and counterparts Donald Trump of the United States, Vladimir Putin of Russia and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nIn Britain, Armistice Day will be commemorated Sunday with a solemn ceremony at the Cenotaph in London that will be attended by Queen Elizabeth II.

Other days, the cranes might be more elusive, choosing to nibble on grain and bugs and amphibians on ranch lands more hidden from view.\n\nMost years, the sandhills, which fly down the central flyway from far northern locations, arrive in South Texas sometime during the last week in October. This year, the first ones arrived Oct. 17, said Alice Anne O\u2019Donell, a birder who counts cranes on the island every day.\n\nOn Sunday morning, O\u2019Donell and Greg Whittaker, of Galveston\u2019s Audubon group, spotted 93 cranes during the early morning watch at Sweetwater Preserve, posted private land owned by the Galveston Bay Foundation. The preserve features shallow pools of fresh water surrounded by clumps of marsh grasses, the birds\u2019 chosen habitat for roosting.\n\n\u201cLast year there were 119 sandhills wintering here,\u201d O\u2019Donell said. \u201cOther years, we\u2019ve had as many as 180.\u201d\n\nThe return of the sandhill cranes each winter is a treat for bird watchers and anyone who thrills at the sight of a 3-foot to 4-foot-tall bird. South Texas from Galveston to Port Aransas, along the coast and down into Mexico, are central winter roosting locales that see tens of thousands of cranes fly in, then leave in the spring to breed in northern climes.\n\nIn Galveston each year, the Galveston Island Nature Tourism Council celebrates their return with a crane festival, to be held this year the second weekend in December.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder humans hold these birds in awe. They are an ancient species with fossils found in North America dating 6 million years that are identical to modern sandhill cranes, according to the International Crane Foundation in Wisconsin. Crane remains have been found in Nebraska Eocene sediments from 55 million years ago. They are among the oldest living bird species on Earth.\n\nSandhills are distinguished by a red mark on their foreheads, black legs and brownish gray bodies that sometimes look more brown than gray as they like to preen their feathers with mud.\n\nThey can live for 33 years, have elaborate courtship rituals, mate for life and often return, year after year, to their favorite stomping grounds, sometimes landing within 150 or so feet of the patch of ground where they landed on a previous migration, according to wildlife biologists.\n\nOne of just a few crane species \u2014 there are 15 altogether \u2014 that are not threatened with extinction, North American sandhills have seen a slight uptick in their overall population over the past several decades to an estimated 700,000.\n\nBut rapid development and habitat loss threaten their migration habits, which is an important thing to remember for any place where they stop to rest during their long migration or return for breeding, local birders said.\n\n\u201cBefore Hurricane Ike, there were three roosts on the island,\u201d O\u2019Donell said. Now, Sweetwater is the only known roost.\n\nBrazoria Wildlife Refuge, just 45 miles southwest of Galveston, sees a large number each year, anywhere from 500 to 1,000 roosting along flooded rice fields on the south side of the refuge, O\u2019Donell said,\n\nThe sandhill crane\u2019s distinctive call is a rattling and loud \u201ckar-r-r-ooo\u201d that can often be heard down below as they make ribbons in the sky, flying high overhead.\n\nAmerican naturalist Aldo Leopold, in 1937, said the sandhill crane\u2019s annual return \u201cis the clicking of the geologic clock.\n\n\u201cWhen we hear his call we hear no mere bird.

In some sectors at the front, Nazi troops came as close as 30 kilometers (20 miles) to the Russian capital.\n\nBut the Nazi offensive lost its momentum in mid-October as it faced adverse weather and logistics challenges, allowing the Soviet command to bring in reinforcements and strengthen the city\u2019s defenses.\n\nAs the fate of Moscow was still hanging in the balance, Soviet leader Josef Stalin ordered the Nov. 7 parade to boost the troops\u2019 morale. The parade has acquired a major symbolic significance, becoming a show of Soviet determination and resolve.\n\nThe Battle of Moscow marked the first time since the start of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union when the Red Army managed to stop the advancing Nazi forces and drive them back. It was the first major Nazi defeat since the start of World War II.\n\nWednesday\u2019s re-enactment featured about 5,000 troops in period uniforms, vintage T-34 tanks and other WW II weapons.\n\nDuring Soviet times, annual military parades were held on Nov. 7 to commemorate the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.

Democratic candidates also won two Supreme Court seats, with one going to Melody Stewart, the first female black judge elected to the state\u2019s highest court.\n\nThe GOP kept its 12-4 majority in the U.S. House delegation, and retains control of the state Senate and House.

With all precincts reported, unofficial results showed DeWine had nearly 51 percent of the vote to 46 percent for the former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau chief. Third-party candidates took about 3 percent of the vote.\n\nGOP candidates also won races for attorney general, auditor, secretary of state and treasurer.\n\nVoters soundly defeated a measure that would have classified possession of certain types of illegal drugs as misdemeanors.\n\nDeWine said Wednesday that his \u201cgut instincts\u201d as he campaigned around the state told him he was ahead of Cordray, but he tempered his expectations because \u201cpoll after poll after poll showed us pretty much dead even.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that we won by the margin we did was a surprise,\u201d he said at an event announcing his transition director, communications director and director of children\u2019s initiatives.\n\nThe traditional Democratic formula of winning big in the state\u2019s largest urban areas and staying close in swing counties hasn\u2019t been working out lately.\n\nDeWine and Husted held Cordray to less than 60 percent of the vote in urban counties containing Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, Toledo and Dayton and beat him by 18 points in those cities\u2019 suburbs. Cordray won about 59 percent of the vote in Ohio\u2019s six most populous counties, while DeWine scored 60 percent of the vote across the rest of the state.\n\nDemocrats still have a big disadvantage with white voters in Ohio\u2019s small towns and rural places. Those voters backed DeWine by about 2 to 1, according to VoteCast.\n\nLosing Montgomery County is nearly always a bad sign for Democrats, and DeWine carried the Dayton area county that neighbors his home county of Greene. Husted also has Dayton ties, from attending the University of Dayton and then representing the area in the Statehouse.\n\nCordray did better than Hillary Clinton in 2016 in the Mahoning Valley area that includes Youngstown, winning Trumbull County after Trump carried it. But many blue-collar Democrats who crossed over for Trump are continuing to vote Republican. Vote totals from the last close governor\u2019s race, when current Gov. John Kasich unseated Democrat Ted Strickland in 2010, underscore GOP gains.\n\nStrickland won 62 percent of the vote in Trumbull County, compared to 51 percent for Cordray, and 66 percent in Mahoning County, compared to 55 percent for Cordray.\n\nThe AP\u2019s VoteCast survey showed DeWine\u2019s victory reflected a strong showing among men, older voters and people in small towns and rural areas. Cordray only managed to split the vote with DeWine among women and had just a slight edge with voters under age 45. But older voters outnumbered younger voters\n\nThe AP\u2019s VoteCast also found two of every three voters said Trump was a factor in their vote.\n\nMarketing consultant Gary Smith of the Columbus suburb of Dublin said Trump was a \u201cbig factor\u201d for him, as was a strong economy.\n\n\u201cTrump is on the ballot whether his name is there or not,\u201d Smith said. \u201d... It\u2019s not because he\u2019s the world greatest human being. It\u2019s because he\u2019s effective. He\u2019s getting things done.\u201d\n\nTrump made four campaign-season visits to Ohio, including Monday in Cleveland. After his decisive 8-percentage-point victory in Ohio in 2016 and another strong GOP statewide showing Tuesday, the future Democratic presidential nominee might decide to bypass Ohio in favor of other traditional swing states that appear more inviting.\n\n\u201cIt really seems that Ohio is solidly Republican and in the Trump Republican column for 2020 and the foreseeable future,\u201d said Suzanne Marilley, a political scientist at Capital University. She said that could change if the economy falters and depending on the Democratic nominee and other state challengers in 2020.\n\nPutting Brown on the national ticket would keep Ohio in the 2020 spotlight. He has professed that he has no burning desire to run for president, but Clinton vetted him as a running mate and he could fit well with potential 2020 candidates such as California Sen. Kamala Harris, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or New Jersey Sen.

Jim Renacci that his victory showed that \u201cprogressives can win and win decisively in the heartland.\u201d He said he won \u201cwithout compromising\u201d on women\u2019s rights, civil rights of LGBTQ rights and without \u201ccaving\u201d to Wall Street, drug companies or the gun lobby and instead celebrating the dignity of work.\n\n\u201cThis is the message coming out of Ohio in 2018 and that is the blueprint for America in 2020,\u201d Brown concluded.\n\n___\n\nSewell reported from Cincinnati.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Rejecting any hint of a setback, President Donald Trump on Wednesday mocked members of his own party who were defeated in the midterm elections after distancing themselves from him and suggested that the Republicans\u2019 loss of a House majority could turn out to be \u201cextremely good\u201d for him politically.\n\nTrump dissected the elections in a combative White House news conference that stretched to nearly 90 minutes as he put a defiantly glossy sheen on the mixed midterm results and stressed his party\u2019s victories in the Senate.\n\n\u201cI thought it was very close to complete victory,\u201d Trump said, adding that he would \u201calmost have to think about\u201d whether he would have preferred Republicans to retain a slim majority in the House instead of their outright loss. Candidates who embraced his message \u201cexcelled,\u201d and those who didn\u2019t faltered, the president added, ticking off a selective list of defeated Republicans to support his point.\n\nThe president\u2019s post-election readout showed his determination to put a positive spin on midterms that will bring an end to GOP control of Congress and open him to Democratic-led investigations in the House. And it made clear the extent to which Trump has remade his party to his own specifications, as he suggested that those who survived were indebted to him, a president who prizes loyalty above all else.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is warning House Democrats about spending the remaining years of his presidency investigating him and his administration. (Nov. 7)\n\nThe results, Trump argued, were proof of his ability to turn out voters. But his message also appeared to alienate well-educated voters \u2014 especially women \u2014 in the suburbs. Democrats surged to their new House majority by picking up seats in more affluent and highly educated suburban districts\n\nBetween his sharp jabs at the press, Trump took credit for Republican wins in the Senate, claiming his \u201cvigorous campaigning stopped the blue wave\u201d that never fully materialize. He was quick to distance himself from losing GOP House members who had been critical of his heated rhetoric, citing Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo and Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman, among others.\n\n\u201cToo bad, Mike,\u201d Trump said of Coffman, before turning on Utah\u2019s Mia Love, whose race remained too close to call.\n\n\u201cMia Love gave me no love and she lost,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that those who backed him were successful was not without exceptions. Republican Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, for example was defeated although he had embraced Trump, with both highlighting their desire to get more of the president\u2019s judicial nominees confirmed, a top priority for many social conservatives.\n\nThe president also suggested that, somehow, losing a House majority could be beneficial to his agenda because Democrats will want to work with him.\n\n\u201cI can see it being extremely good politically,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president\u2019s rebuke was felt on Capitol Hill. Rep. Ryan Costello, a Republican from Pennsylvania who announced his retirement earlier this year, tweeted his displeasure: \u201cTo deal w harassment & filth spewed at GOP MOC\u2019s in tough seats every day for 2 yrs, bc of POTUS; to bite ur lip more times you\u2019d care to; to disagree & separate from POTUS on principle & civility in ur campaign; to lose bc of POTUS & have him piss on u. Angers me to my core.\u201d\n\nTrump, who had spent months demonizing Democrats as lawless \u201cmobs\u201d and telling his rally crowds that their ascendancy would tank the economy and plunge the nation into crime-ridden chaos, said Wednesday it was time for bipartisan co-operation. He claimed that Democrats \u2014 who made opposing him a centerpiece to their campaign \u2014 would, in fact, be eager to work with him on issues like infrastructure. But the olive branch he extended was studded with thorns as he declared that he would retaliate if Democrats use their control of the House to issue subpoenas to seek his tax returns and investigate his business dealings, his Cabinet\u2019s conduct and his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia, as expected.\n\n\u201cThey can play that game, but we can play it better. Because we have a thing called the United States Senate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf that happens, then we\u2019re going to do the same thing and government would come to a halt and we\u2019re going to blame them.\u201d\n\nThe White House news conference was punctuated by Trump\u2019s escalating attacks on the media. The president repeatedly flashed his temper as he insulted several reporters by name, interrupted their questions, ordered some to sit down and deemed one inquiry about his embrace of the description \u201cnationalist\u201d to be \u201cracist.\u201d\n\nHis back-and-forth with CNN reporter Jim Acosta over Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration rhetoric grew especially heated, with Trump labeling the reporter a \u201cvery rude person\u201d and saying the outlet \u201cshould be ashamed of itself\u201d for employing him.\n\nTrump, as he did throughout the campaign, also blamed the media for sowing division in the country and insisted they were to blame for the scene unfolding in the East Room.\n\n\u201cI come in here as a nice person wanting to answer questions and I have people jumping out of their seats shouting questions at me,\u201d he complained.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Catherine Lucey, Darlene Superville and Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "PONTIAC, Mich.

(AP) \u2014 Republican candidates maintained control in Tennessee in Tuesday\u2019s election with the help of high voter turnout throughout the state.\n\nTwo open statewide contests sparked high-profile attention in the buildup to Election Day, with officials reporting high amounts of early voting and absentee ballots being cast.\n\nDespite the attention, little will change in the political makeup of Tennessee. Republicans will continue to control the U.S. Senate, governor\u2019s seat and statehouse, but the longstanding moderate tone that outgoing GOP leaders such as U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, Gov. Bill Haslam and House Speaker Beth Harwell held while in office could be exchanged with more outspokenly Republican replacements.\n\nHere is a look at the major victories:\n\nU.S. SENATE\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn became Tennessee\u2019s first female U.S. senator after defeating Democratic former Gov. Phil Bredesen.\n\nThe two had been locked in a tough, expensive fight to replace Corker, who is retiring at the end of the year.\n\nThe campaign spending shattered Tennessee records, as Bredesen argued he would be an independent voice in Washington, and Blackburn countered by tying him to national Democrats. Blackburn closely aligned herself with the White House, having drawn visits to Tennessee from President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and other prominent Republicans.\n\nBredesen\u2019s campaign had spent $15.2 million through mid-October, while outside groups have spent about $26.3 million as of early this week to help him. Blackburn\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, shelled out about $12 million through mid-October, and outside groups some $31.6 million for her bid.\n\nBlackburn, from Brentwood, was first elected to the U.S. House in 2002. She calls herself a \u201chardcore, card-carrying Tennessee conservative\u201d who will fight for Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nBredesen was Tennessee\u2019s governor from 2003 to 2011, and served as Nashville\u2019s mayor before that.\n\nGOVERNOR\n\nRepublican businessman Bill Lee won his bid to be Tennessee\u2019s next governor against former Democratic Nashville Mayor Karl Dean.\n\nWhile the battle for governor was often overshadowed by the high-profile Senate race, the race did result in record breaking spending in the build up to Election Day.\n\nUltimately, voters chose Lee, a political newcomer who touted his faith and used the success of his business \u2014 Lee Company, a $225 million mechanical contracting, facilities and home services firm with more than 1,200 employees \u2014 to argue that he\u2019s ready to lead the state.\n\nThat victory was secured in an overall positive campaign between the two candidates. However, Dean spent the last few weeks of the campaign increasing Lee\u2019s vague answers on the state\u2019s top policy issues. In one ad, Dean went as far as to call Lee \u201cextreme\u201d due to his support for private school vouchers and arming teachers.\n\nLee has continued to shrug off those accusations and declined to address them when asked. He instead has vowed to work with both political parties to move Tennessee forward.\n\nU.S. HOUSE\n\nDemocrats made no gains in the nine races for the U.S. House, including three open seats retained by Republicans.\n\nAll six House incumbents cruised to victory to maintain the party breakdown status quo: Seven Republicans, two Democrats.\n\nFormer GOP Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett won in District 2 in East Tennessee, a seat vacated due to the retirement of Republican John Duncan Jr.\n\nRepublican Diane Black\u2019s failed gubernatorial run made room for a new face in District 6, where Republican farmer John Rose won.\n\nRepublican Marsha Blackburn\u2019s successful run for U.S. Senate left District 7 open, and GOP state Sen.

(AP) \u2014 Pennsylvania elected a state record four women to the U.S. House on Tuesday as Democrats smashed the state\u2019s all-male congressional delegation, picked up three seats in the chamber and ousted a three-term Republican.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf will return for a second term, Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey won a third term and Democrats chipped away at the huge Republican majorities in the state Legislature.\n\nIn the U.S. House, Mary Gay Scanlon, Madeleine Dean, Susan Wild and Chrissy Houlahan stand to become the first women from Pennsylvania to serve full terms in Congress since 2014, while U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb beat three-term Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus in a suburban Pittsburgh race pitting two incumbent representatives against each other.\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s U.S. House delegation will be a 9-9 tie, giving Democrats their most seats in eight years in a state President Donald Trump narrowly won in 2016\u2032s presidential election.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 victories came amid a favorable election climate and the state\u2019s highest midterm turnout in nearly 25 years. The party was aided by a backlash against Trump, the most U.S. House open seats in decades and new court-ordered congressional district boundaries that made seats more competitive.\n\nPennsylvania has never sent more than two women to Congress at any one time, according to information from Chatham University.\n\nLamb, a former Marine and federal prosecutor who won a special election in March to an open seat in southwestern Pennsylvania, scored another victory Tuesday in a district that had backed Trump in 2016.\n\nBoth Lamb and Rothfus live in a newly drawn district, a quirk of the state Supreme Court\u2019s overhaul of Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional boundaries after it ruled the districts had been unconstitutionally gerrymandered by Republicans in 2011.\n\nThose boundaries had helped the GOP win 13 of 18 seats in three straight general elections, even as Democrats dominated races for statewide offices.\n\nElsewhere, nine incumbents won re-election, while Republicans filled three open seats that had heavily favored their party. A 10th incumbent, Mike Doyle, of Pittsburgh, had no challenger. Three Republican incumbents \u2014 three-term Scott Perry, four-term Mike Kelly and freshman Brian Fitzpatrick \u2014 survived close races.\n\nCasey and Wolf had led polls by big margins for months, leaving little doubt about the outcome of their races Tuesday night.\n\nCasey, the 58-year-old son of the late governor, beat Republican Congressman Lou Barletta, a staunch Trump backer who had been endorsed in a state the president won just two years ago. Casey\u2019s victory gives him a third six-year term in office and ensures that Trump will have another swing-state opponent in the Senate.\n\nThe race was a far cry from Pennsylvania\u2019s record-breaking $170 million Senate contest in 2016, likely coming in at under $40 million. Barletta, a prominent anti-illegal immigration hawk, campaigned on Trump\u2019s record, but never gained traction against Casey.\n\nCasey handily outspent Barletta and, while Trump campaigned for Barletta twice in Pennsylvania, Barletta still received virtually no outside help from GOP groups to overcome Casey\u2019s heavy fundraising advantage and built-in recognition as a household name in Pennsylvania politics.\n\nWolf beat brash Republican challenger Scott Wagner, who also closely identified himself with Trump. Backed by a unified Democratic Party and labor unions, Wolf had a huge fundraising advantage over Wagner, who fought an unexpectedly bruising and expensive three-way primary, and struggled to find a weakness in his opponent.\n\nWagner, who had pledged to cut taxes and rein in an out-of-control state government, spent considerable time explaining away his often eyebrow-raising off-the-cuff comments. Those included comments critical of public schools and teachers, and Wagner\u2019s advising Wolf last month in a video streamed online to put on a catcher\u2019s mask because \u201cI\u2019m going to stomp all over your face with golf spikes.\u201d\n\nJoining Wolf as lieutenant governor will be John Fetterman, the Braddock mayor whose efforts to improve the impoverished town over the past 13 years drew national attention and made him a media darling. Fetterman beat sitting Lt. Gov. Mike Stack in a five-way Democratic primary in May.\n\nWolf will return for another four years to share power with a GOP-controlled Legislature, whose big majorities will be somewhat diminished after Tuesday\u2019s election after at least a dozen seats in the southeast flipped to Democrats.\n\nIn partial results, Democrats won at least 12 Republican House seats, and the GOP took two House seats that had been held by Democrats.\n\nIn the state Senate, Republicans lost at least four seats, all in suburban Philadelphia. Republicans went into the election with a 121-82 majority in the House and a 34-16 advantage in the Senate.", "A worker observes the rising wooden roof process as part of Olympic Gymnastic Centre for Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic games under construction is seen in Tokyo Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018.

There has been some controversy about the origin of wood used in the new Olympic Stadium, which is under construction in central Tokyo.\n\nThe gymnastics venue will seat about 12,000 and will be used for 10 years after the Olympics as a convention center by the Tokyo metropolitan government. After that, plans call for the building to be razed.\n\nThe venue is located in the Tokyo Bay region in an area known as Ariake. The area will also have Olympic venues for tennis, volleyball, BMX and skateboarding.\n\nLocated close by in the bay region are also venues for triathlon, marathon swimming, beach volleyball, swimming, water polo, archery, 3x3 basketball, sport climbing, hockey, equestrian, canoeing and rowing.\n\nOlympic organizers and the International Olympic Committee have been criticized for leaving behind empty, unused venues in Rio de Janeiro \u2014 where Biles was among the stars of the games \u2014 and earlier this year at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\n\nTokyo organizers are using a mix of new, old and temporary venues, hoping to avoid the stigma of creating white elephants.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Gretchen Whitmer gives her acceptance speech after being elected the next governor of Michigan, in Detroit, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

Dana Nessel was on track to becoming the first Democrat elected as Michigan attorney general in 20 years after her opponent conceded.

And female candidates helped Democrats cut into, but not break, GOP majorities in the Legislature as voters backed ballot initiatives to legalize marijuana for recreational use , take aim at partisan gerrymandering and expand voting options.\n\n\u201cWe see what happens when people show up at the polls and make their voices heard,\u201d Whitmer said Wednesday during her first news conference as governor-elect. \u201cI feel really good that the voters of this state voted to reject bigotry and hate. They voted to reject the divisive politics that seem to be permeating everything.\u201d\n\nAbout six in 10 women voters supported Whitmer, who will be Michigan\u2019s second female governor when she succeeds term-limited Rick Snyder in January. Nearly four in 10 women favored Schuette, while male voters were about evenly divided. Meanwhile, nearly six in 10 women favored Stabenow, while James appeared to have a slight lead among men.\n\nNearly six in 10 voters said their feelings about President Donald Trump influenced their ballot choices.

The last time the state consecutively elected governors from the same party was the 1960s, and the party opposite the president has now won 10 of the last 11 elections.\n\nWhitmer, of East Lansing, was a state lawmaker for 14 years \u2014 always in the minority \u2014 and later served as Ingham County\u2019s interim prosecutor. As the top Democrat in the Senate, she spoke forcefully against GOP-backed laws that slashed business taxes while raising them on individuals, made union fees optional, and required residents or businesses wanting health insurance coverage for elective abortions to buy extra coverage. She disclosed during a debate on the abortion bill that she had been raped in college.\n\n\u201cI like the idea of having a woman governor. I think it\u2019s important for girls to see women in leadership positions,\u201d said Kristin Schrader, a 51-year-old marketing and communications officer for a Girl Scouts organization who voted for Whitmer and lives in Superior Township near Ann Arbor. \u201cIf there were a better male candidate, of course I\u2019d vote for him. So it\u2019s not the overriding factor, but it helps.\u201d\n\nOthers who voted for Whitmer cited her pledge to press for a multibillion-dollar plan to improve Michigan\u2019s deteriorating roads.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great night for women in Michigan,\u201d said Slotkin, who worked in intelligence and defense in the Obama and Bush administrations. \u201cNot just because they are women, but because they are extremely competent women.\u201d\n\nDemocrat Rashida Tlaib won a House district to become one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress.

Manchin is a former governor who has held elected office in West Virginia for the better part of three decades.\n\nManchin heavily outspent Morrisey and portrayed himself as loyal to his home state rather than party ideology. Manchin was the only Senate Democrat to vote to confirm U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nManchin was critical of Morrisey\u2019s New Jersey roots and his past lobbying ties to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nMorrisey is a two-term state attorney general and a staunch Trump supporter.\n\nU.S. HOUSE\n\nRepublican state lawmaker Carol Miller held off a strong challenge from Democratic state Sen. Richard Ojeda in the 3rd District, a seat Republican Evan Jenkins gave up for an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate.\n\nMiller is the third woman from West Virginia elected to Congress. Maude Kee served in the U.S. House from 1951 to 1964 after the death of her husband. Shelley Moore Capito served seven terms in the House before being elected as a U.S. senator in 2014.\n\nMiller\u2019s late father also served in Congress from Ohio.\n\nIncumbent Congressmen David McKinley in the 1st District and Alex Mooney in the 2nd District won re-election.\n\nMcKinley defeated Democrat Kendra Fershee to win a fifth term. Fershee is a West Virginia University law professor and associate dean of academic affairs.\n\nMooney won his third term in Congress by defeating Democrat Talley Sergent, a former Hillary Clinton state presidential campaign director.\n\nSTATE SENATE\n\nRepublicans will maintain control of the West Virginia Senate but lost their majority leader.\n\nThe GOP won nine of the 17 Senate seats up for grabs on Tuesday night. The other 17 seats were not on the ballot.\n\nRepublicans will enter 2019 with a 20-14 Senate majority.\n\nSenate Majority leader Ryan Ferns was unseated by Democrat Bill Ihlenfeld, a former U.S. attorney. Ferns is a Republican from Ohio County who came under scrutiny during a nine-day teachers strike last winter.\n\nThe other ousted incumbent was Kanawha County Republican Ed Gaunch, who lost to Democrat Richard Lindsay.\n\nSUPREME COURT\n\nTwo appointed Supreme Court justices have won election to those seats.\n\nFormer House speaker Tim Armstead and ex-Congressman Evan Jenkins survived crowded campaigns Tuesday night. They were appointed by Republican Gov. Jim Justice to fill two seats on the state\u2019s highest court until the election. They each defeated nine other candidates.\n\nArmstead will complete the term of retired Justice Menis Ketchum. The term runs through 2020.\n\nJenkins will serve until 2024, when the term of retired Justice Robin Davis ends.\n\nJudicial elections in West Virginia became nonpartisan in 2016, but the court\u2019s impeachment scandal this year stirred political attacks. Some Democrats argued that the court\u2019s shake up over spending and other issues was a power grab by the Republican-led legislature.\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS\n\nWest Virginia voters approved two proposed constitutional amendments. One would allow lawmakers to restrict or outlaw state funding for Medicaid abortions. The other would give legislators the option of reducing part of the state judiciary\u2019s annual budget.\n\nThe abortion amendment approved Tuesday came after the Republican-led Legislature earlier this year approved a resolution to add a line to the state constitution that reads: \u201cNothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of an abortion.\u201d\n\nOpponents say it would put the issue in the hands of the Legislature, which could ban Medicaid-funded abortions in cases of rape, incest or when a woman or girl\u2019s health is at risk.\n\nThe other ballot measure allows the Legislature to decide each year whether to reduce the courts\u2019 budget but not less than 85 percent of the previous year\u2019s budget. It also would require the Supreme Court\u2019s chief justice to answer budget questions before lawmakers.\n\nOpponents have said limiting the Supreme Court\u2019s budgetary control would infringe on its independence. The chief justice currently has constitutional autonomy in deciding how the system spends a $139 million annual budget.\n\nDuring an ongoing impeachment process, some of the justices were accused of abusing this authority by failing to rein in excessive spending.", "WHITE MARSH, Md. (AP) \u2014 A Maryland mall has no plans to enact a curfew on unaccompanied teenagers, despite the urging of a county council following a fight this summer.\n\nNews outlets report the Baltimore County Council unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution Monday calling on White Marsh Mall to ban unaccompanied minors on Friday and Saturday nights.\n\nSeveral councilmembers have been trying to convince mall management to adopt such a policy after an August fight at the mall resulted in the arrests of seven minors and two 19-year-olds.\n\nThe resolution encourages the mall to adopt the policy that\u2019s in effect at Towson Town Center, which is also owned by Brookfield Property Partners. But a Brookfield spokeswoman told The Baltimore Sun on Tuesday the company has no plans to institute a youth curfew at White Marsh.", "In this Oct. 19, 2018 photo, a visitor stands by the train carriage in which the armistice of the Nov. 11, 1918 was signed, in the forest of Compiegne, north of Paris. The French and German leaders this weekend will jointly visit the remains of the train carriage where the armistice ending World War I was signed on Nov. 11, 1918. For the French, the dining car became a shrine to peace. For Adolf Hitler, it was a symbol of the humiliation of surrender. The Nazi leader had it dragged to Germany after conquering France in World War II. (AP Photo/Thibault Camus)\n\nCOMPIEGNE, France (AP) \u2014 Adolf Hitler went in wartime for revenge. Angela Merkel plans a pilgrimage in the name of peace. Two German chancellors, with opposite aims and the same destination: a train car in a French forest.\n\nHitler tried literally to rewrite history in 1940 when the Nazi leader commandeered the dining coach to serve France the same humiliation Germany suffered there on the last day of World War I.\n\nThis time, Merkel will have the French president by her side as she visits what remains of the Wagon of Compiegne, the carriage-turned-office where the Allies and Germany signed the armistice on Nov. 11, 1918.\n\nVIDEO: Watch the Movietone news service's post-World War II report on the unusual history of the carriage and its replacement.\n\nAn unusual journey took Wagons-Lits Co. carriage 2419D from serving sauteed veal and boeuf bourguignon to passengers in the seaside town of Deauville to serving as a crucible for world peace while stopped in the middle of a forest in Compiegne.\n\nPuzzled tourists often ask Bernard Letemps, the curator of the Armistice Museum, why the Allies signed the cease-fire agreement that ended the atrocities of the Western Front in that humble setting instead of a grand military building or a glittering palace.\n\nAt the time, the official headquarters in Senlis of the Allied commander, French Marshal Ferdinand Foch, would have been the expected place to sign a cease-fire.\n\nBut the town had endured a brutal German assault. Its inhabitants were taken hostage and its mayor shot in September 1914, before the first Battle of the Marne. How the bruised townspeople would react to the presence of a German delegation, even one coming with the goal of peace, was a serious concern.\n\n\u201cIt was out of the question to receive the plenipotentiary Germans in (such a) town,\u201d Letemps said.\n\nA moveable train carriage in the nearby Compiegne forest was deemed ideal: The isolated location would deter intruders and the calm and secrecy offered a measure of respect to the defeated Germans.\n\nAs it happened, Foch had fitted out a mobile office just the month before \u2014 a dining car chosen at random from the French passenger train fleet. And so 2419D became known as the \u201cWagon of Compiegne.\u201d\n\nThe Armistice was signed just after 5 a.m., but officials held out six hours to put it into effect out of a sense of poetry \u2014 the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918. That delay, rather unpoetically, cost lives on both sides at the end of a war that had already left 17 million dead.\n\n\u201cThe train car represents the end of fighting. The end, when people found peace,\u201d Letemps said.\n\nHe added, smiling: \u201cIt fulfilled its role of dining car before becoming famous.\u201d\n\nThe Armistice Museum lays on the train tracks on the site of the signing in the middle of forest.\n\nFoch was immortalized in statues ubiquitous across France and gave his name to one of the broad, leafy avenues radiating out from the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nThe same reception was not reserved for the losing side: One of the Germans to sign the document, Matthias Erzberger, was vilified for his role in the surrender. He was assassinated in 1921.\n\nThe story of dining car 2419D and Compiegne didn\u2019t end with the war.\n\nFor throngs of French mourners in the post-war years, the dining car became a shrine to peace and catharsis.\n\nThe car was taken to Paris for display in the courtyard of the Invalides, the final resting place of Napoleon, before it went back to Compiegne in 1927 to sit in a specially-made memorial constructed on the site of today\u2019s museum.\n\nLetemps said the wagon received over 190,000 visitors in one year alone in the 1930s as it became a focus for mourning France\u2019s 1.4 million fallen soldiers.\n\nFor Hitler in those same years, it became a rallying cry during his ascent to power as he exploited the German public\u2019s contempt for the punitive terms of surrender.\n\nThe Nazi leader visited the site in 1940 when his armies conquered France.\n\nThe Fuhrer ordered the dining car brought out of the memorial and returned to the tracks in the spot in the forest it occupied in 1918.\n\nWhat ensued was Hitler\u2019s surreal theatrical restaging of the 1918 armistice, one of history\u2019s most famous events, with literally the tables\u2019 turned.\n\nThe 1940 Armistice was dictated in that train \u2014 with Germany the victor and France the loser.\n\n\u201cGeneral (Wilhelm) Keitel read the conditions for the Armistice in the car, with Chancellor Hitler sitting in the place of Marshal Foch,\u201d Letemps said.\n\nHitler then ordered the car to be hauled to Germany and displayed, like a notorious prisoner of war, at the Berlin Cathedral.\n\nThe dining car was destroyed at the end of World War II, though how that happened has been lost to time. Some accounts blame members of the Nazi SS, others a random airstrike.\n\nIn 1950, French manufacturer Wagons-Lits, the company that ran the Orient Express, donated a car from the same series to the museum \u2014 2439D is identical to its ravaged twin from its polished wooden finishes to its studded, leather-bound chairs. It is parked beside the display of the original car remains: a few fragments of bronze decoration and two access ramps.\n\nOn Saturday, Merkel becomes the first German chancellor in 78 years to visit the forest clearing where the end of the globe\u2019s first conflict was written.\n\nShe will be joined by French President Emmanuel Macron in a scene reminiscent of 1984 when Chancellor Helmut Kohl poignantly held President Francois Mitterrand\u2019s hand at an ossuary near Verdun.\n\nOn the centenary of the conflict\u2019s end, this visit will make for soul-searing images of its own.\n\n___\n\nThomas Adamson can be followed at Twitter.com/ThomasAdamson_K\n\n___\n\nFull coverage of WWI commemoration events at: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\n\u201cWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition\u201d is available now exclusively on Amazon: https://amzn.to/2JGrx5U", "OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) \u2014 Republicans and Democrats traded a handful of seats in the state House and Senate in midterm elections, but the GOP maintained its commanding control of the Oklahoma Legislature for at least another two years.\n\nHalf of the seats in the 48-member Senate and all 101 seats in the state House were up for grabs in this year\u2019s round of elections that concluded with Tuesday\u2019s general election.\n\nPreliminary results indicate Democrats picked up one new seat in the Senate, the first time Democrats have had a net gain of Senate seats during a regular election cycle since 1990. There are now 39 Republicans and nine Democrats in the Senate.\n\nIn the state House, Republicans gained three seats to expand their majority to 76-25. Three Democratic incumbents, including House Minority Leader Rep. Steve Kouplen of Beggs, Rep. Donnie Condit of McAlester and Rep. Karen Gaddis of Tulsa, were defeated in the general election.\n\nRepublicans have controlled both houses of the Oklahoma Legislature since 2008. Republicans gained control of the state House in 2004 for the first time since 1921 and took control of the Senate for the first time in state history in 2008 after being tied 24-24 following the 2006 election.\n\nOnly a handful of the nearly 50 teachers on the ballot were successful in their races for state legislative seats, after energized Oklahoma educators\u2019 joined a springtime rebellion across red states including Kentucky, West Virginia and Arizona. But the Oklahoma Education Association says the number of lawmakers with classroom experience has nearly tripled \u2014 from nine to 25 \u2014 following this year\u2019s elections, including 16 who were elected Tuesday.\n\nThe OEA said more educators are serving in the state Legislature than at any other time in state history following a statewide teacher walkout over teacher pay and classroom funding in April.", "FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) \u2014 The blue wave missed Kentucky on election night, with Republicans maintaining their majorities in the state legislature and winning a competitive congressional race in the central part of the state.\n\nHere are some of the key races:\n\n6th CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr survived a fierce challenge from Democrat Amy McGrath, a retired Marine fighter pilot. McGrath raised about $3 million more than Barr during the campaign, but she did not spend it on traditional attack ads. Barr did, flooding the airwaves with ads depicting McGrath as \u201ctoo liberal for Kentucky.\u201d It was enough for Barr to keep his seat in the conservative district on a night when Democrats picked up seats across the country.\n\n3rd CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT\n\nDemocratic Rep. John Yarmuth will remain the state\u2019s lone voice of dissent among Kentucky\u2019s GOP-dominated delegation. Vickie Yates Glisson surprised people in January when she resigned as secretary of the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services to challenge Yarmuth. But Yarmuth easily won the race with 62 percent of the vote in the heavily Democratic district.\n\nTEACHERS REVOLT\n\nAt least 36 current or former educators ran for seats in Kentucky\u2019s state legislature, but most of them lost. One Republican incumbent lost to a Democratic teacher candidate, while another GOP lawmaker trailed a college professor by just one vote. In total, at least 10 teachers were elected, including four Republicans. But the \u201cblue wave\u201d Democrats had hoped for failed to materialize as Republicans maintained their majorities in the state House and Senate.\n\nROWAN COUNTY CLERK\n\nRowan County Clerk Kim Davis went to jail in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses after same-sex marriage became legal. Now, she\u2019s out of a job. Voters elected Democrat Elwood Caudill Jr. with 54 percent of the vote.\n\nMARSY\u2019S LAW\n\nKentucky voters overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the state\u2019s Constitution to guarantee rights for crime victims, including the right to be notified of and present for most court proceedings. But the results will be on hold. That\u2019s because a state judge ruled the question on the ballot is unconstitutionally vague. The ruling is being appealed, but a final decision won\u2019t come until after the election. That means Tuesday\u2019s votes were counted, but state officials will wait to certify the results.\n\nSUPREME COURT\n\nVoters promoted Court of Appeals Judge Debra Hembree Lambert to the Kentucky Supreme Court. Circuit Court Judge Dan Ballou had an endorsement from Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, but it wasn\u2019t enough to defeat Lambert, who won with 67 percent of the vote. Lambert will replace retiring Justice Daniel Venters in the district, which includes 27 counties in southern and south-central Kentucky.\n\nMAYOR\u2019S RACES\n\nKentucky\u2019s two largest cities elected mayors on Tuesday. In Louisville, Democrat Greg Fischer won a third term over Republican Angela Leet. In Lexington, former Vice Mayor Linda Gorton defeated former Police Chief Ronnie Bastin in a nonpartisan race.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics"]
