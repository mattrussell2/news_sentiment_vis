(Jasic Workers Support Group via AP)\n\nBEIJING (AP) \u2014 Students and alumni of several Chinese universities are sounding the alarm over the apparent detention of more than a dozen young labor activists who have been missing since the weekend.\n\nThree recent graduates of the elite Peking University have been taken away by authorities, the Jasic Workers Support Group said in a statement late Tuesday. According to the group, witnesses saw one person being \u201ckidnapped\u201d from the Beijing campus, while others in Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Shanghai also disappeared.\n\nThey were involved in a coalition, led by young Marxist activists, that was founded this summer to show solidarity with factory workers at Jasic Technology, a welding equipment manufacturer in southern China.\n\nActivists in China are routinely \u201cdisappeared\u201d by authorities working for the ruling Communist Party, which is wary of any collective action and potential threats to its authority. The government is particularly guarded about campus movements after the 1989 student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square that were ultimately crushed by the military.\n\nThe young Marxists are an unusual target, however, because they espouse the same values \u2014 socialism, workers\u2019 rights and Marxist ideology \u2014 the party has advocated.\n\nThe sudden disappearances all occurred around 9 p.m. on Friday, the Jasic Workers Support Group said. Three others in Wuhan, including one factory worker, were taken away by police on Sunday, though one was released early the next day.\n\nPeking University students and alumni expressed alarm after students published accounts online saying that they were beaten on campus by unidentified men who forced a recent graduate named Zhang Shengye into a car on Friday evening.\n\nIn a statement posted on an internal Peking University forum, the school\u2019s security department said the \u201csituation\u201d on Friday was that of a \u201cpolice department lawfully taking into custody a criminal suspect ... who is not a current student, teacher or employee of the school.\u201d\n\nA member of the security department confirmed over the phone Wednesday that the statement came from the university.\n\nOne fourth-year history student, writing on the Jasic Workers Support Group\u2019s website, said he was thrown to the ground outside of a lecture hall by five people dressed in black.\n\nWhen he asked them who they were, he recalled, one swore at him and yelled, \u201cIf you keep yelling, we\u2019ll keep hitting you!\u201d Shortly afterward, a tall, burly man started kicking his head.\n\nThe student said he then saw that someone was being dragged into a car that swiftly drove away.\n\nThe student who wrote this account could not be reached on Wednesday. Members of the Jasic Workers Support Group, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believe he has been forced to leave campus for the time being.\n\nSomeone who identified himself as a third-year Peking University medical student said in an online post Wednesday that he had a similar encounter on that same night, when people in dark clothing rushed at him and held him to the ground until he bled.\n\nThirteen Peking University alumni attached their names to a public letter Wednesday evening protesting the treatment of the students, who said they were beaten.\n\nDecrying the \u201cillegal, gang-like violence,\u201d they wrote, \u201cPeking University should be a place where rule of law thrives!\u201d\n\nZhang, who graduated from Peking University\u2019s pharmaceutical school this year, was a vocal member of the Jasic Workers Support Group. He was among about 50 young people from across the country who convened in an apartment near Shenzhen in August to rally behind Jasic factory workers who were fired for trying to form a union.\n\nThe apartment was stormed by police in riot gear and the group members were detained for a few days before authorities escorted them back to their hometowns. Several had their phones confiscated for the remainder of the summer and continued to be hounded by police back home, according to a student who took part in the action.", "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 A five-member North Korean delegation is visiting South Korea to attend an academic forum on Japan\u2019s wartime actions.\n\nThe delegation\u2019s arrival Wednesday comes as the two Koreas continue reconciliation efforts despite stalemated U.S.-led nuclear diplomacy.\n\nThey are among 300 people from nine countries who are to take part in Friday\u2019s forum near Seoul.\n\nThe forum will discuss Japan\u2019s forced mobilization of laborers during the war, and how to boost exchanges among Asia-Pacific countries.\n\nAnti-Japanese sentiment runs deep in both Koreas because the Korean Peninsula was colonized by Japan for 35 years before its division at the end of World War II in 1945.\n\nThe South Korean government says it has no plans to meet with the North Korean visitors.", "FRANKFORT, Ky.

George \u201cBilly\u201d Wagner III was arrested after being found in a horse trailer in Lexington Tuesday. The 47-year-old Wagner waived his rights to an extradition hearing in a brief appearance Wednesday in Lexington district court.\n\nThe announcement of Wagner\u2019s arrest along with his wife and two adult sons marked the culmination of a massive investigation that began after seven adults and a teenage boy were found shot in the head at four separate rural Ohio homes in April 2016. The killings terrified Ohio residents and spawned rumors that it was a drug hit, but prosecutors suggested Tuesday the attack had stemmed from a custody dispute.\n\nThe investigation is one of the most complicated and extensive in state history, with enormous numbers of witnesses and a huge amount of evidence, said Pike County Prosecutor Rob Junk.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of hard work ahead of us. I cannot emphasize that enough. An indictment is only the beginning of the case,\u201d Junk said Tuesday, adding the case may have to be moved to a different county because of pre-trial publicity.\n\nOther Pike County officials are concerned about the costs and issues they will face in housing the suspects, such as added security and other needs. County Commissioner Blaine Beekman said Wednesday the county of 28,000 is already in a budget crunch and officials plan to meet with Junk before reaching out to state officials for help.\n\n\u201cObviously, we are pleased that the arrests have been made and that, if the evidence is there, the people will be brought to justice,\u201d Beekman said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a double-edged sword. ... Now comes the reality of how are we going to pay for this? We have no book to refer to.

Police arrested Wagner; his wife, 48-year-old Angela Wagner; and his sons George Wagner III, 27, and Edward Wagner, 26. They could be sentenced to death if convicted, DeWine said.\n\nEdward Wagner was also charged with unlawful sexual conduct with a minor for having sexual contact with Rhoden when she was 15 years old and he was 20 years old, DeWine\u2019s office said.\n\nDeWine gave scant detail about why the victims were killed, other than saying the custody of a young child played a role.\n\nTony Rhoden, who lost two brothers in the killings, said the family was still processing the news.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d Rhoden told the Columbus Dispatch. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to take in.\u201d\n\nThe Wagner family lived near the scenes of the killings about 60 miles (97 kilometers) south of Columbus. They moved to Kenai, Alaska, in June 2017, then returned to Ohio this past spring.\n\nKelly Cinereski, an Alaskan pastor and friend of the family, told the Dayton Daily News he was shocked by their arrests.\n\n\u201cThese people wept over dogs, I can\u2019t imagine them taking people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said.\n\nFredericka Wagner, the mother of Billy Wagner, and Rita Newcomb, the mother of Angela Wagner, were also arrested and charged with misleading investigators.\n\nBoth Edward Wagner and Angela Wagner previously told the Cincinnati Enquirer they were not involved in the killings.\n\nAngela Wagner said in an email to the newspaper what happened was devastating and Hanna Rhoden was like a daughter to her.

In 2015, for example, it accounted for more than 18 percent of all car deals made that month.\n\nBut Black Friday isn\u2019t the sales juggernaut it once was.\n\nJust as other retailers now push \u201cEarly Black Friday\u201d sales right after Halloween and online brands hype their Cyber Monday specials, carmakers have morphed Black Friday into Black November \u2014 and beyond. In 2017, Black Friday weekend represented less than 14 percent of the month\u2019s sales. Edmunds analysts expect this downward trend to continue this year.\n\nFor car shoppers, the trend translates to greater flexibility and less stress. Here\u2019s what you need to know about getting a great deal.\n\nTHE LEFTOVER EFFECT\n\nThe sales season is extending partly because carmakers are more willing to let outgoing models linger at dealership lots.\n\nThe trend showed up in earnest early this year. In March 2018, roughly 28 percent of new vehicles sold were brand-new 2017 models. Compare that with the previous five years, where leftover inventory made up just 12 percent of March sales on average.\n\nEdmunds analysts predict that at least 20 percent of new vehicles for sale early next year will be 2018 models. Based on inventory levels of new 2018 models currently on dealer lots, expect to see a good supply of new 2018 midsize sedans, midsize SUVs and compact SUVs as late as March 2019, along with specials to move them out.\n\nIf you\u2019re a bargain hunter, that\u2019s good news. Instead of having to shop on just one weekend, you have more time to snag a great deal.\n\nSHOULD I BUY NOW?\n\nStart price-shopping immediately if you know the make and model you want. Once you\u2019ve got a good feel for how much the car will cost now, you may want to pull the trigger if you fall into any of these categories:\n\n\u2014 You\u2019re planning to lease your next vehicle: Because of the way leases are calculated, waiting isn\u2019t likely to help you.\n\n\u2014 Your local dealership is running an aggressive promotion: It\u2019s possible that a dealership selling the brand you\u2019re after might have a unique sales goal to hit. It could offer Black Friday incentives to get you to buy now. Free iPads, televisions or in-house zero percent interest loans are some of the perks dealerships have used to entice shoppers in years past.\n\n\u2014 You\u2019re looking for something specific: The longer you wait, the less selection you\u2019ll have. While prices on 2018 models may continue their slide through the first quarter of 2019, a low price on the wrong vehicle is a bad compromise.\n\n\u2014 The vehicle you\u2019re eyeing has a special low-interest rate offer: Interest rates are rising, and that trend is expected to continue. If you\u2019ve found an attractive price on the right car, and the interest rate is a good one (given the times), you might want to make a deal. If you wait for a lower selling price but get saddled with a higher interest rate, you haven\u2019t done yourself any favors.\n\nSHOULD I WAIT?\n\nYou may want to consider holding off on your purchase if you fall into any of these categories:\n\n\u2014 You plan to purchase with cash: As cars languish on dealer lots, chances are that good prices will go even lower. If you\u2019re paying cash and aren\u2019t concerned with rising interest rates, waiting may save you money.\n\n\u2014 Your vehicle needs are flexible: Most of the hot products are going to be sold first. If you don\u2019t mind selecting from what\u2019s left in exchange for a lower selling price, it may make sense to wait.\n\n\u2014 Your credit is iffy: Maybe you can\u2019t get a low interest rate now because of your credit profile, but you still want to get a heavily discounted clearance vehicle. Use this time to improve your credit standing so you\u2019ll be able to take advantage of clearance pricing and a low interest rate in early 2019.\n\nEDMUNDS SAYS: Black Friday is still an excellent time to buy a car. But unlike the doorbuster deals at your local big-box retailer, the Black Friday specials at a car dealership are likely to be around well after the holiday weekend.\n\n____\n\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

That helped send prices lower. Brent crude is trading below $70 per barrel, down from a four-year high above $86 per barrel in early October.\n\nBrent prices rose 0.6 percent on Wednesday to $65.86 at 1115 GMT (6:13 a.m. EST).\n\nThe Paris-based agency welcomed the higher production and stockpiles, saying that the response to the call by the IEA and others to boost production \u201cis a reminder that the oil industry works best when it works together.\u201d\n\nThe agency said that lower prices \u201care clearly a benefit to consumers,\u201d especially those in developing countries who are seeing higher fuel prices due to weak national currencies. Oil is priced in dollars and the U.S. currency has been strong of late.\n\nThe report authors warned that although the market seems more relaxed than a few weeks ago, rising stocks should be \u201cwelcomed as a form of insurance\u201d against unpredictable market events. The report notes that \u201cthe United States remains committed to reducing Iranian oil exports to zero from the 1.8 million barrels per day seen today.\u201d\n\nThere were also concerns about the stability of production in Nigeria, Libya, and Venezuela, while a tanker collision in Norwegian waters, though modest in impact, \u201cis another reminder of the vulnerability of the system to accidents.\u201d", "CALGARY, Alberta (AP) \u2014 Calgary\u2019s bid to host the 2026 Winter Olympics was rebuffed on Tuesday when local voters said \u201cno\u201d in a nonbinding referendum.\n\nUnofficial results showed that 56 percent voted against bidding for the Olympics.

(AP Photo/Laszlo Balogh)\n\nCHOP, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 The Hungarian minority in western Ukraine is feeling besieged.\n\nA new education law that could practically eliminate the use of Hungarian and other minority languages in schools after the 4th grade is just one of several issues threatening this community of 120,000 people in Transcarpathia, a Ukrainian region that in the past century has been part of Hungary, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.\n\nIn February, the headquarters of the minority\u2019s biggest political organization, the Transcarpathian Hungarian Cultural Association, or KMKSZ, was firebombed. More recently, mysterious billboards have appeared in the region accusing its politicians of separatism. And a dispute has erupted over the legality of the community acquiring dual Hungarian citizenship.\n\nThe incidents have left many worried that even as Ukraine strives to bring its laws and practices closer to European Union standards, its policies for minorities seem to be heading in a far more restrictive direction.\n\n\u201cThere is a sort of purposeful policy, which besides narrowing the rights of all minorities, tries to portray the Hungarian minority as the enemy in Ukrainian public opinion,\u201d said Laszlo Brenzovics, the only ethnic Hungarian in the Ukrainian parliament. He called the separatism charges \u201cextraordinarily absurd\u201d and a means to distract from Ukraine\u2019s domestic problems.\n\nBrenzovics\u2019 party, the KMKSZ, has launched its own campaign with bilingual billboards reading \u201cLet\u2019s not allow peace to be destroyed in Transcarpathia!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a peace campaign to calm the mood,\u201d said Livia Balogh, a party official in Chop, a once-booming railroad city of 9,000 people on the border with Hungary. \u201cHungarians here are mostly surprised and tense but also angry that the minority card is being played.\u201d\n\nWith a presidential election expected in March, Ukraine is also facing an ongoing armed conflict on its eastern borders with Russian-backed separatists. Officials say the new language rules in education, to be implemented over several years, serve a unifying purpose.\n\n\u201cEducation is the fundament to social cohesion, which is also the fundament of security in the country,\u201d said Anna Novosad, a senior official at Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Education and Science. She attributed Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014 partly to the disintegration and linguistic isolation of the local, mainly Russian-speaking population from the rest of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThis is something that we would like not to repeat in the western part of our country,\u201d Novosad said.\n\nVasyl Filipchuk, a Ukrainian diplomat and chair of the board of the International Center For Policy Studies in the capital Kiev, said the anti-Hungarian campaign was being used to distract voters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s artificial, manipulative technology\u201d to overshadow the real problems of the people \u2014 corruption, lack of jobs and lack of economic prospects, Filipchuk said, adding that the use of patriotic, nationalistic rhetoric is \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d\n\nSome of the issues have triggered a diplomatic dispute between Ukraine and Hungary, with Hungary blocking Ukraine\u2019s talks on integration with the European Union and NATO until the language stipulations in the education law are revised. In early October, Ukraine expelled a Hungarian consul after a secret video surfaced of Ukrainian Hungarians taking the oath of Hungarian citizenship. In response, Hungary expelled a Ukrainian consul.\n\nAlmost all members of Ukraine\u2019s Hungarian minority live in Transcarpathia \u2014 called Zakarpattia Oblast in Ukrainian and Karpatalja in Hungarian. The last census, from 2001, counted 151,000 Hungarians, but unofficial estimates now see around 120,000.\n\nScores have emigrated to Hungary and western Europe, driven in part by Ukraine\u2019s economic crisis and facilitated by the possibility of acquiring dual Hungarian citizenship, which comes with a European Union passport.\n\nIt\u2019s a community that is still strongly tied to Hungary \u2014 everyone seems to set their watches to Hungary\u2019s time zone, an hour behind Ukraine\u2019s.\n\nJozsef Kantor, principal of a high school with some 700 students in Velyka Dobron, a village near Chop with a majority Hungarian population, acknowledged that a more modern education law was needed. Still, he lamented the \u201cmuch harsher and unfavorable education law\u201d now proposed.\n\nAt Kantor\u2019s school, which is undergoing renovations paid mostly by subsidies from the Hungarian government, Ukrainian language and literature are the only classes not taught in Hungarian. National authorities seem open to developing Ukrainian language textbooks which would take into account the fact that many Hungarian children enter school without speaking much, if any, Ukrainian.\n\nMany of the school\u2019s graduates are taking advantage of having an EU passport to get their higher education in Hungary or elsewhere abroad.\n\n\u201cWhat affects us negatively is that many of them don\u2019t come back,\u201d Kantor said. \u201cUltimately, if this continues for 20 or 30 years, there\u2019s a risk that the intellectual class among Hungarians in Transcarpathia will shrink significantly.\u201d\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has made a name for himself in Europe through his unrelenting anti-immigration and nationalist policies, has made supporting the estimated 2.2 million Hungarians living in neighboring countries \u2014 lands that Hungary lost after World War I and the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire \u2014 a key objective.\n\nSubsidies totaling some $60.1 million have been given to institutions, businesses and families abroad since 2017, and Brenzovics, the lawmaker, said the payments have helped establish 3,000 new businesses.\n\nOfficials have simplified steps for Hungarians abroad to acquire dual Hungarian citizenship. An initial goal of adding 1 million dual citizens \u2014 on top of Hungary\u2019s population of some 10 million \u2014 was achieved nearly a year ago.\n\nOrban\u2019s efforts have created a political windfall. In April\u2019s elections, over 95 percent of voters casting ballots by mail \u2014 mostly from neighboring countries \u2014 backed Orban\u2019s coalition led by his Fidesz party, helping him to a third consecutive term.\n\nIn Chop, teacher Zsuzsanna Dzjapko, a Hungarian whose husband\u2019s family is Russian-Ukrainian, has accepted the fact that the best educational prospects for their 11-year-old daughter Rebeka \u2014 who speaks all three languages and is a talented singer and musician \u2014 are across the border.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have hopes that she\u2019ll come back, because as a Hungarian folk singer in this country, she wouldn\u2019t have much of a future,\u201d Dzjapko said in a small apartment shared by three generations. \u201cWe hope the times will change, the winds will change and the laws will change, as well.\u201d", "FILE - In this Dec. 9, 2012, file photo, New Orleans Saints defensive end Will Smith appears before an NFL football game against the New York Giants in East Rutherford, N.J.

Hayes is serving a 25-year sentence for manslaughter in Smith\u2019s death and attempted manslaughter in the wounding of Smith\u2019s wife during a confrontation following a traffic collision in April 2016.\n\nHayes insisted at trial that he fired after a drunk, angry Smith retrieved a gun from his car and fired first.\n\nBarker said none of a host of witnesses had a clear view of everything that happened amid the tumult following the accident in New Orleans\u2019 Lower Garden District.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Kyle Daly countered that Hayes was alone among witnesses in saying Smith brandished a gun or fired it. A semi-automatic handgun was found loaded but unused in Smith\u2019s car. And while Barker said gunfire residue on Smith\u2019s body raises doubt that he never fired, Daly said it was consistent with being shot at close-range with a larger weapon.\n\nIt was unclear when the three-judge appellate panel would rule.\n\nBarker argued that trial judge Camille Buras should have granted a new trial because a witness who contacted the defense a day after Hayes\u2019 conviction said he had heard two gun fire from two weapons at the time of the shooting.\n\nThe witness, military veteran Michael Burnside, delivered rambling and at times profane testimony at a post-trial hearing last year. Daly argued that he wasn\u2019t credible. Burnside lived blocks from the shooting scene and, Daly argued, his testimony indicated a series of shots fired at a slower rate than the rapid-fire shooting Hayes had described.\n\nParker also contends the trial judge should have allowed testimony about Smith\u2019s 2010 arrest on a domestic abuse charge after former Saint Deuce McAllister spoke of Smith\u2019s sterling reputation among his teammates and friends.\n\nSmith was arrested outside a southwest Louisiana bar in 2011 on misdemeanor charges of domestic abuse battery and public intoxication. Lafayette Parish prosecutors dropped the charges in 2012 after Smith completed community service and participated in counseling.\n\nDaly argued that Buras was right to avoid what would have amounted to a \u201cmini-trial on the Lafayette incident.\u201d\n\nSmith, a 34-year-old father of three, was a defensive leader on the Saints team that lifted spirits in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005. He helped carry the team to a winning season in 2006 and a Super Bowl victory four years later.\n\nHayes was 29 when he was convicted in December 2016.

It was the first time that a candidate for prime minister has ever been rejected by the 349-seat Riksdagen.\n\nNorlen said he would continue talks with party leaders on Thursday, without giving details.\n\nThe September election produced a hung parliament with the left-leaning side and the center-right bloc securing about 40 percent of the vote each, leaving neither with a majority and paving the way for months of uncertainty and complex coalition talks.\n\nBoth blocs have refused to cooperate with the Sweden Democrats, who made great strides in the election.\n\nAnnie Loof, the leader of the Center Party that voted against Kristersson, said he had broken up the 14-year-old center-right alliance by suggesting a two-party government, leaving out her party and the Liberals.\n\nKristersson said that that although the alliance has suffered \u201cits worst crisis,\u201d it is not dead.\n\n\u201cWe have a common platform, but we cannot agree when it comes to taking power.\u201d\n\nCaretaker Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, who heads Sweden\u2019s largest party \u2014 the Social Democrats \u2014 said he was willing to discuss with Loof should she be tapped to try to form a coalition.\n\nLoof earlier said that she doesn\u2019t want to be prime minister herself but is willing to try form a government.\n\nPundits say either Loof or Lofven would be next in line to try to form a government.\n\nThe emergence of Sweden Democrats \u2014 with roots in a neo-Nazi movement \u2014 reflects how deeply that Sweden is being transformed by migration.\n\nIn 2015, Sweden took in a record 163,000 migrants \u2014 the highest per capita of any European country.

Emerging from the five-hour meeting at 10 Downing St., May said the Cabinet talks had been \u201clong, detailed and impassioned.\u201d She said there had been a \u201ccollective decision\u201d to back the deal, though she did not say whether it was unanimous.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of the United Kingdom,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a warning to her opponents, May said the choice was between her deal, \u201cor leave with no deal; or no Brexit at all.\u201d\n\nIf the EU backs the deal, as it likely will, it must be approved by Britain\u2019s Parliament. That could be a challenge, since pro-Brexit and pro-EU legislators alike are threatening to oppose it.\n\nPro-Brexit lawmakers say the agreement will leave Britain tethered to the EU after it departs and unable to forge an independent trade policy.\n\nOn the other side of the argument, pro-EU legislators say May\u2019s deal is worse than the status quo and the British public should get a new vote on whether to leave or to stay.\n\nIn between those two camps are May\u2019s supporters, who argue that the deal is the best on offer, and the alternatives are a chaotic \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit that would cause huge disruption to people and businesses, or an election that could see the Conservative government replaced by the left-of-center Labour Party.\n\nFailure to secure Cabinet backing would have left May\u2019s leadership in doubt and the Brexit process in chaos, with exit day just over four months away, on March 29.\n\nShe still faces the threat of a coup attempt from her own party.\n\nUnder Conservative rules, a no-confidence vote in the leader is triggered if 15 percent of party lawmakers write letters requesting one. The required number currently stands at 48 lawmakers; only the lawmaker who collects the letters knows for sure how many have been submitted.\n\nPro-Brexit Conservative lawmaker Conor Burns said he wanted a change of policy rather than a new leader, but added: \u201cThere comes a point where if the PM is insistent that she will not change the policy, then the only way to change the policy is to change the personnel.\u201d\n\nThe main obstacle to a withdrawal agreement has long been how to ensure there are no customs posts or other checks along the border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit. Britain and the EU agree that there must be no barriers that could disrupt businesses and residents on either side of the border and undermine Northern Ireland\u2019s hard-won peace process.\n\nThe solution in the agreement involves a \u201csingle EU-U.K. customs territory,\u201d to eliminate the need for border checks.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the U.K. will agree to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental standards and workplace protections \u2014 another source of anger for Brexiteers, who say Britain should be free to set its own rules.\n\nThe solution is intended to be temporary \u2014 superseded by a permanent trade deal. But pro-Brexit politicians in Britain fear it may become permanent, hampering Britain\u2019s ability to strike new trade deals around the world.\n\nLeading Euroskeptic Conservative legislator Jacob Rees-Mogg urged his colleagues to vote against the deal, saying it \u201cwill lock us into an EU customs union and EU laws. This will prevent us pursuing a U.K. trade policy based around our priorities and economy.\u201d\n\nThe draft agreement also mentions potential \u201cNorthern Ireland-specific regulatory alignment\u201d to avoid a hard border.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May\u2019s minority government, insists it will oppose any deal that leaves Northern Ireland subject to different rules to the rest of the U.K. after Brexit.\n\n\u201cWe could not as unionists support a deal that broke up the United Kingdom,\u201d DUP leader Arlene Foster said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jill Lawless reported in London and AP writer Lorne Cook reported from Brussels.", "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Police say a 24-year-old man suspected in a drug-related robbery and shooting at an Indianapolis home was one of two people slain during the holdup.\n\nThe Indianapolis Star reports that Robert Lee was found outside the home after Tuesday night\u2019s shooting on the city\u2019s west side.

A man who claims he \"fell in love\" with a meerkat pup has been fined $4,000 in a Perth court, Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018 after pleading guilty to stealing the animal from its enclosure at Perth Zoo in September. (Perth Zoo via AP)\n\nSYDNEY (AP) \u2014 It wasn\u2019t grand theft. It was tiny.\n\nBut the snatching of a baby meerkat from a zoo has not only become a major story in the Australian city of Perth, it has led to the arrest of three people.\n\nIn September, Perth Zoo was ready to publicly show off its new month-old meerkitten to the public and media, but a day before its planned debut, it was gone.\n\nWorried zoo staff said the male baby, who hadn\u2019t yet been named, had apparently got out of its nest box, and feared it may have been snatched by a bird of prey.\n\nBut the other possible reason for its disappearance \u2014 theft \u2014 was also explored.\n\nPolice were called to investigate, and two days later they found the missing meerkat \u2014 at a house 130 kilometers (80 miles) away, in the town of Beverley.\n\nPolice charged two people who had visited the zoo over the furry heist. Jesse Ray Hooker, 23, was charged with stealing, while his friend Aimee Cummins, also 23, with receiving stolen goods.\n\nOn Wednesday police charged a third person, a 31-year-old woman, also from Beverley, with possessing stolen property.\n\nHooker appeared in Perth Magistrates Court, also on Wednesday, where defense lawyer Chad Silver said that he \u201cfell in love\u201d with the newborn meerkat as it ran toward him in its enclosure and had scooped it up and put it in his cooler bag.\n\nHe had then played loud music on the drive home to Beverley so that Cummins, unaware of the heist at the time, couldn\u2019t hear the animal\u2019s distressed cries. After a stop at McDonald\u2019s, the pair took the meerkitten home, adding it to a menagerie of four dogs and a cat.\n\nSilver told the court Hooker was in the process of returning the meerkat when the police called. In the tiny town of Beverley, population 1,700, even a secret that small was apparently too hard to keep.\n\n\u201cThe simplicity of the offence meant the police were able to capture and follow up the meerkat very quickly,\u201d Silver told the court.\n\nIn front of a large media contingent, Hooker pleaded guilty and was fined 4,000 Australian dollars ($2,800). Cummins would have faced her verdict, but Silver said she could not attend the hearing, citing medical reasons and intense media pressure.\n\nShe\u2019ll appear in person in January. The 31-year-old woman will face court next month.\n\nAs for the meerkitten, despite fears from zoo staff his mob would reject him, he\u2019s been welcomed back into the fold and given a name from the East African language of Kiswahili: Salama, which means \u201csafe.\u201d", "A former dock facility is shown with old transfer bridges, with \"Long Island\" painted in large letters at Gantry State Park in the Long Island City section of Queens, N.Y., Tuesday Nov. 13, 2018, in New York. Amazon announced Tuesday it has selected the Queens neighborhood as one of two sites for its headquarters. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The awarding of Amazon\u2019s second headquarters to two affluent localities has fanned intense speculation around a key question: For the winning cities, will the economic payoff prove to be worth the cost?\n\nAmazon\u2019s decision will bring to Arlington, Virginia, and the Long Island City section of New York a combined 50,000 jobs and $5 billion in investment over the next two decades. But the influx is sure to swell already-high home prices and apartment rents and could overwhelm public transportation systems. And the two areas combined are providing over $2 billion in subsidies to one of the world\u2019s richest companies \u2014 a bounty that many analysts say probably wasn\u2019t necessary to sway Amazon.\n\nThe decision to bring those jobs, which Amazon says will pay an average of $150,000 a year, to the New York and Washington areas will also exacerbate U.S. regional inequalities, economists say. Such Midwestern cities as Columbus, Ohio, and Indianapolis, Indiana, which made Amazon\u2019s short list, would have helped spread the tech industry\u2019s high-skilled, high-paying jobs more broadly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ambiguous for the winners, not good for the \u2018losers\u2019 and not good at all for the nation,\u201d said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nStill, on the surface, the deal appears to be better than most. Amazon says it\u2019s receiving $1.525 billion in incentives and subsidies from New York state and $573 million from Virginia and Arlington County. That works out to $61,000 in incentives provided to Amazon for each job in Long Island City and roughly $23,000 for each job in Arlington.\n\nThat compares with a much larger average figure of $658,000 per job for other large deals, said Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a nonpartisan watchdog group. Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn, for example, received $4.8 billion in subsidies for a plant in Wisconsin on which it broke ground this year. That deal is expected to bring just 13,000 jobs.\n\nYet the true figure for New York\u2019s subsidies is likely closer to $2.8 billion. Amazon will also qualify for $897 million in tax credits from New York City over the next 12 years if it hits its target of creating 25,000 jobs. That\u2019s based on a tax credit of $3,000 for each new employee. It would also receive a 15-year abatement of property taxes on its new Queens campus, worth an estimated $386 million, according to New York\u2019s governor.\n\nThose city tax credits aren\u2019t unique to the Amazon deal. The job creation tax credit is available to all companies in the city. And the property tax abatement is available for most development projects outside of business districts in Manhattan.\n\nBut Amazon\u2019s final selections suggest that all the subsidies and giveaways probably weren\u2019t needed, some economists said. Other state and local governments offered a lot more, including at least $8.5 billion on behalf of Montgomery County, Maryland, and $7 billion for Newark, New Jersey.\n\n\u201cIf Amazon was pursuing subsidies, it made the wrong decision,\u201d said Michael Farren, a research fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center. \u201cEven the biggest subsidies you can imagine really don\u2019t sway these kinds of decisions.\u201d\n\nRather, Amazon\u2019s top priority was having access to a sizable pool of highly skilled employees, Farren said, and it likely would have chosen the same two locations even without the subsidies.\n\n\u201cThe only things they\u2019re useful for are the companies that get them and the politicians who get the credit,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, Jay Carney, an Amazon senior vice president, acknowledged in an interview on CNN that the company had chosen two locations that offered less in subsidies than others had.\n\n\u201cThat reflects that talent was really the driving factor for us,\u201d Carney said.\n\nSome experts in regional economics suggested that the payoff for the selected cities would go well beyond Amazon\u2019s initial investment. Stephen Fuller, an economist at George Mason University, estimates that the new headquarters in Arlington would generate roughly $1.3 billion in spending each year after the initial construction is complete. That would support nearly 50,000 jobs in the state, Fuller said, in addition to those at Amazon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a no-brainer,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to pay an enormous amount in real estate taxes and sales taxes.\u201d\n\nFuller also argues that the region is large enough to absorb the influx of new workers.\n\n\u201cThe region adds 50,000 jobs every year, and no one complains about that,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cThey\u2019re not all coming at one time; they\u2019re coming over 15-20 years. It isn\u2019t as overwhelming as people think it\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Tim Bartik, a senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, cautioned that with unemployment so low in both cities, many of the jobs Amazon will bring will likely go to people who don\u2019t now live in either Arlington or New York. The inflow of those workers could burden schools and transportation systems.\n\nA coalition of nonprofit groups warned that Amazon\u2019s arrival will likely worsen housing affordability for many lower-income workers in the two cities. Roughly one-third of residents in Washington, D.C., and 40 percent in New York pay more than 30 percent of their income on housing, the groups, which include LeRoy\u2019s Good Jobs First, pointed out. The typical rent in Queens, which includes Long Island City, is already $3,000 a month.\n\nSome analysts had thought Amazon might follow a trend that other companies have set and add jobs in cities where salaries and housing were often cheaper. A few Wall Street banks, for example, have sent many of their back-office jobs to states far from New York. The auto factories that once filled the Midwest have migrated to the South, where labor unions have held less sway.\n\nInstead, Amazon chose to expand its footprint to two places where salaries and home prices are relatively close to those of Seattle, its current sole headquarters city, said Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at the real estate firm Zillow.\n\n\u201cThese two markets definitely can absorb this kind of employment shock \u2014 and they have some time to prepare for it,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAP Economics Writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the correct spelling of Michael Farren\u2019s name, instead of Ferren.", "MUNICH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov 14, 2018--Skyworks Solutions, Inc.

Opinion polls indicate Bainimarama is poised to win a second term in Fiji's general election Wednesday after he first held democratic elections in 2014, eight years after he seized power in a coup. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)\n\nSUVA, Fiji (AP) \u2014 The man who first seized power in a military coup then refashioned himself as a legitimate leader appears set to rule Fiji for another four years.\n\nPrime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama and his FijiFirst party were headed for a convincing election win early Thursday as votes were tallied. Bainimarama has ruled the island nation since his 2006 coup, and won his first election in 2014 after returning democracy to the country.\n\nWith about half of the votes counted, FijiFirst was ahead with 53 percent while closest rival the Social Democratic Liberal Party, led by Sitiveni Rabuka, was at 37 percent. The margin was closer than in the last election, when FijiFirst won almost 60 percent of the vote.\n\nRabuka led two military coups in the 1980s before serving seven years as prime minister in the 1990s. Just this week, a judge cleared him of an electoral disclosure violation in a case that many viewed as being politically motivated.\n\nHeavy rainfall throughout Wednesday affected voter turnout. The bad weather prompted officials to close more than 20 polling venues, affecting more than 7,000 voters who were promised the chance to vote at a later date.\n\nBefore voting ended, Supervisor of Elections Mohammed Saneem urged voters to brave the weather, saying low turnout needed \u201cto increase as much as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe weather is a bit discouraging,\u201d said Akanisi Lal. That didn\u2019t stop the 53-year-old from taking a break from looking after her family to vote for Bainimarama.\n\n\u201cI have seen what he has been doing over the past four years,\u201d she said, citing policies such as free bus fares for seniors. \u201cHe will go deeper if he comes again in power.\u201d\n\nSome voters were reluctant to say who they voted for because of fear of reprisals. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be victimized,\u201d said Jashneel Kumar, a 24-year-old nurse.\n\nFiji has not allowed the political tensions to take a toll on its vital tourism industry, which promotes the Pacific nation\u2019s pristine, sunny beaches and friendly, welcoming people.\n\nGiven the history of coups, political stability was a big issue leading up to the election, as were racial tensions and economic issues.\n\nMany people in the nation of 920,000 seem appreciative of the economic gains they\u2019ve made under Bainimarama.\n\n\u201cThere are no school fees. Before, I paid a couple hundred for school fees,\u201d said Mere Rigamoto, a 42-year-old mother of three boys. \u201cBainimarama\u2019s government is not bad. He\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nBut Bainimarama has a troubled political history that has contributed to the coup culture. There were rumors he could stage another coup should he lose the election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bound to have another coup if he doesn\u2019t win,\u201d said 30-year-old Robert Lum On, a recent university graduate.\n\nFiji became independent from the U.K. in 1970. In 1987, Rabuka staged two racially charged coups to return the country to the hands of indigenous Fijians, who make up about 57 percent of the population, and away from Fijians of Indian descent, who make up 38 percent.\n\nIndo-Fijians have been a major ethnic group in Fiji since colonial times, when the British brought them in to work the sugar cane plantations. Many Indo-Fijians favor Bainimarama, whose new constitution in 2013 removed race quotas from Parliament.\n\n\u201cBainimarama\u2019s key success has been to establish the name \u2018Fijian\u2019 for all citizens of Fiji,\u201d said Richard Herr, a professor at Fiji National University who is based in Australia. \u201cHis legislation has made campaigning on race, or even having a racially based party, illegal.\u201d\n\nOn the campaign trail, Bainimarama accused Rabuka of stoking the flames of racism that continue to divide the nation. But some indigenous Fijians believed Rabuka would help restore their prestige, and liked his promise to bring back the nation\u2019s Great Council of Chiefs, which Bainimarama disbanded.\n\nCritics deride Bainimarama as authoritarian, but since forcing himself into power, he has changed his image into that of a stable, legitimate leader. His appeal was bolstered when he assumed the U.N. COP23 presidency in November 2017. In that role, which he holds until December, he shaped Fiji into a pioneer on climate change issues.\n\nWith COP23 as a platform, Fiji inserted small island developing states into the international conversation on climate change. The islands are on the front lines of global warming, rising sea levels and ocean acidification.\n\nAfter the 2006 coup, Australia and New Zealand imposed sanctions on Fiji, and Bainimarama reoriented regional alliances toward China. His critics accuse him of selling out the country to the Chinese.\n\nThe Lowy Institute says Fiji received about $360 million in aid from China between 2006 and 2016, putting it behind only Papua New Guinea in the Pacific region. China Exim Bank holds 39 percent of Fiji\u2019s externally held public debt, according to The Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nFiji\u2019s relations have since normalized with Australia and New Zealand, but the period of sanctions enabled China to step up its regional influence.\n\nFiji has one of the healthiest economies of the Pacific Islands, and GDP is predicted to grow above 3 percent annually through 2020. Tourism is the bedrock of the economy, accounting for more than 40 percent of GDP.\n\nBainimarama\u2019s government takes credit for increasing social services, including free primary and secondary education, free bus fares for seniors, and aid in the aftermath of cyclones. But widespread poverty persists. Bainimarama\u2019s opponents vowed to raise the minimum wage, which remains only about $1.25 per hour.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Nick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report.", "Israeli protesters hold flags during a demonstration against the cease-fire between Israel and Gaza's Hamas in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018.

This has inflicted heavy damage on Gaza, but Hamas remains firmly in power.\n\nOusting the group would require a military operation that could take months and cost the lives of thousands of Palestinian civilians and many Israeli soldiers. Reluctant to pay such a price, Netanyahu instead seems content to keep a weakened Hamas in check.\n\nNetanyahu may also have a deeper agenda. Leaving the Palestinians torn between two governments \u2014 Hamas in Gaza and the internationally backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank \u2014 works in his favor.\n\nWith the Palestinians weak and divided, there is little pressure for Netanyahu to make concessions, allowing him to expand West Bank settlements and cement Israeli control over the territory.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has repeatedly accused Israel and the U.S. of collaborating behind his back and preparing a peace plan offering the Palestinians a mini-state in the Gaza Strip and small autonomous areas of the West Bank. That falls short of his demand for a fully independent Palestinian state that includes both territories in full.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t true that Netanyahu doesn\u2019t have a policy. He does: He is a firm believer in perpetuating the status quo,\u201d wrote Israeli columnist Nahum Barnea.\n\nBIBI\u2019S BOUNCER\n\nLieberman is a former aide to Netanyahu who has been both an ally and rival over the years. He currently heads Yisrael Beitenu, a small ultranationalist party that appeals to immigrants from the former Soviet Union.\n\nA brawny former nightclub bouncer known for his sharp tongue and Russian-accented Hebrew, the Soviet-born Lieberman has sought to project an image as a gruff, tough-talking politician. At times, he has been critical of Israel\u2019s Arab minority, liberal opposition groups and even Israel\u2019s Arab ally Egypt. Sitting in the opposition, he once threatened to assassinate Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh if he held the defense portfolio.\n\nBut as defense minister, Lieberman\u2019s accomplishments remain limited, and Haniyeh is alive and well in Gaza.\n\nCalling the cease-fire \u201csurrender to terrorism,\u201d Lieberman also made clear that his frustrations run much deeper. He said he also opposed a recent decision to allow Qatar to deliver $15 million in aid to Gaza and the cancellation, under heavy international pressure, of the planned demolition of a Bedouin village in the West Bank.\n\n\u201cWe are buying quiet in the short-term at the cost of severe damage to our security in the long-term,\u201d he said. \u201cThe weakness we displayed also projects itself to other arenas.\u201d\n\nIS NETANYAHU THREATENED?\n\nIf Netanyahu calls early elections, opinion polls forecast a broad victory by his Likud Party and his hard-line partners, including Lieberman.\n\nWith his resignation, Lieberman appears to be positioning himself for elections by painting Netanyahu as soft and portraying himself as a defense hawk.\n\nBennett, another former Netanyahu aide who leads the religious Jewish Home Party, is likely to use a similar strategy. Like Lieberman, Bennett had favored tougher military action against Hamas.\n\nAll three appeal to a similar bloc of voters. Although Netanyahu would likely emerge as the leader, siphoning off votes would strengthen his rivals and give them increased leverage.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s rivals are eager to tap into public anger over the cease-fire. Residents in rocket-battered towns in southern Israel, typically Likud strongholds, have protested the truce.\n\nLieberman is especially desperate. His party holds only five Knesset seats, barely above the threshold required to enter the parliament.\n\nNetanyahu, meanwhile, will probably market himself as the responsible adult in a room of inexperienced children.\n\n\u201cI see the big picture of Israeli security that I cannot share with the public,\u201d he said Wednesday as he defended the cease-fire. \u201cIn times like these, leadership is not doing the easy thing. Leadership is doing the right thing, even if it is hard. Leadership is sometime facing criticism.\u201d\n\nOne wild card: Police have recommended indicting Netanyahu in a series of corruption investigations. If Israel\u2019s attorney general decides to file charges, Netanyahu could be weakened or even forced to step down, shaking up any election campaign. However, if he is re-elected before a decision is made, it could make it much harder to press charges against a leader with a fresh mandate. Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit has not said when he will decide.\n\nHAPPY HAMAS\n\nIn Gaza, Hamas declared victory in the latest round of fighting, boasting that it stood up to the powerful Israeli military. Large crowds of supporters celebrated in the streets.\n\n\u201cThe resistance has sent a clear message to the occupation that it can hurt them,\u201d boasted Ismail Radwan, a Hamas spokesman.\n\nAfter the dust settles, Hamas will once again have to cope with running a territory where unemployment is over 50 percent, the economy is in tatters and where people cannot travel abroad.\n\n\u201cWe have to bear in mind that Hamas\u2019 popularity has improved on similar occasions in the past,\u201d said Mkheimer Abusada, a Gaza analyst. \u201cBut that was for a short period of time, after which people would face the harsh reality of unemployment and poverty.\u201d\n\nHamas will return its focus toward U.N. and Egyptian mediation aimed at easing the crippling Israeli blockade in exchange for assurances of quiet.", "ATAQ, Yemen (AP) \u2014 Al-Qaida was giving away motorcycles up in the mountains \u2014 that\u2019s what the kids in town were saying the day Abdullah disappeared.\n\nEarly that morning, Mohsanaa Salem woke her 14-year-old son to go buy vegetables. The sun had just risen above the mountain ridge, and winter light filled the ravine where their mud brick house sat at the foot of a slope. \u201cLet me sleep,\u201d Abdullah groaned from a mattress on the floor, surrounded by his brothers and sisters.\n\nOne word from his father, though, and the boy was up and dressed, trudging out of the house to the market in a neighboring village. Three hours later, when he still hadn\u2019t returned, Mohsanaa and her husband began to worry.\n\nThey were a family trying to get by in Yemen, a nation at war with itself that has become a battleground for more powerful countries.\n\nThey knew that many families like theirs had been caught in the middle, with thousands killed in fighting between Iranian-backed rebels from the north, known as Houthis, and forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition trying to restore the ousted government.\n\nThey knew that al-Qaida militants were based in the mountains, sending fighters out to battle the Houthis, while trying to elude missiles fired from U.S. drones that often killed innocents.\n\nAnd they knew Abdullah was a good boy, though a bit naive. He never strayed far \u2014 just to school or to play soccer with his friends in a lot so close his mother could see it from the house. At about 10 a.m., Mohsanaa and her husband called around to the couple dozen other families who lived in their village to ask if anybody had seen Abdullah.\n\nNo one had, and his parents\u2019 worry grew to panic.\n\n\u2014This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.\n\nAll around al-Said district, in Yemen\u2019s southern Shabwa province, people heard the American drone overhead on the morning of Jan. 26.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t unusual. The sky often buzzed with drones hunting for the moment to strike at the al-Qaida militants, a mix of locals, foreign fighters and Yemenis from other parts of the country who had moved into the district.\n\nFrom above, the drone surveyed an inhospitable landscape of barren limestone mountains, creased with ravines and gorges. Zooming in on those threads of green, the drone would have scanned dozens of isolated villages like the one where Abdullah lived, each just a few houses above plots of land planted with wheat and animal fodder.\n\nAbdullah\u2019s village, Shaab Arshan, sits in a wadi just over 100 meters (yards) wide in places, the bare mountains rearing up steeply on either side. Ravines and gorges lead to slightly larger valleys that eventually open into desert, the fringes of the vast Empty Quarter that takes up much of the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nAl-Qaida fighters come down to the valleys to resupply and recruit in the markets. They pass out memory cards with their videos and lectures. They show up at weddings or funerals now and then, preaching to those in attendance. And they offer gifts to teens and young men, the most vulnerable and easily swayed to join their ranks.\n\nFor more than a decade, the United States has waged a drone war against al-Qaida in Yemen, trying to eliminate one of the most dangerous branches of the terror network. The Trump administration has dramatically ramped up drone strikes, carrying out more in two years than the Obama administration did over its entire eight years \u2014 176, compared to 154. More than 300 people \u2014 militants and civilians \u2014 were killed in 2017 and 2018 by one estimate.\n\nAt least 30 civilians were killed in 2018, The Associated Press found, based on accounts from family members and witnesses. A few weeks before Abdullah\u2019s disappearance, a drone\u2019s missile slammed into a farm in a neighboring province, killing a 70-year-old man and a young relative who had just returned from mediating a land dispute.\n\nBut here in al-Said district, it had been months since the last strike.\n\n___\n\nSoon after he left the house, Abdullah ran into a schoolmate who told him al-Qaida militants were giving away motorcycles in the town of Mosaynaa. The friend had heard it from a neighbor who belonged to the group.\n\nAbdullah had never thought of joining al-Qaida and he didn\u2019t want to now. He was in the 8th grade and dreamed of becoming a doctor one day. But he knew how to drive, and he wanted a motorcycle.\n\nThe boys agreed they would go get the motor bikes and come right home.\n\nThey caught a ride to the market in Yashbom, where Abdullah used part of the money his mother had given him to pay for a taxi to Ataq, the provincial capital on the other side of the mountain.\n\nAbdullah loved Ataq \u2014 the closest thing to a city the village boy had seen. His father took him and his siblings there to buy gifts at holiday times and new clothes before the start of school. He always pleaded with his parents to send him to school there as a reward if he made it to the top of his class.\n\nIt was there that his friend had been told to contact the militants who would take them where they needed to go. They had no idea how far away that would be.\n\n___\n\nAbdullah\u2019s parents expanded their search to nearby villages and called relatives in Ataq. No one had seen their boy.\n\nWhat if a driver had hit Abdullah and sped away? He could be lying by the side of the road, or maybe someone found him and took him to a hospital.\n\nAbdullah was their miracle child. Mohsanaa had complications in the pregnancy and gave birth to twins after only seven months. Abdullah\u2019s brother died within days, and doctors were sure Abdullah would die, too. He was tiny, hairless, and there were no incubators at the hospital.\n\n\u201cIf you saw him, you\u2019d think he was a doll, just the size of the palm of your hand,\u201d Mohsanaa said.\n\nWhen Mohsanaa brought Abdullah home, she wouldn\u2019t let anyone near him. She fed him formula. She kept him warm by spreading butter over his body and wrapping him in cotton. Every day, he got better, and by six months \u201che became a normal baby,\u201d she said.\n\nIn an impoverished country where nearly four years of civil war have pushed millions to the brink of starvation, the family had much to be thankful for. Abdullah\u2019s father, Saleh bin Elwiya, worked as a taxi driver and made enough to feed his wife, four sons and four daughters.\n\nSaleh was a careful driver, plying the roads all day as far as Aden, southern Yemen\u2019s biggest city, on the coast. He adored his children and had taught all his sons to drive, except for the youngest, Abdel-Salam, who at 8 couldn\u2019t reach the pedals yet.\n\nHe always urged Abdullah to focus on his schoolwork.\n\n\u201cYou just study, and I will take care of everything else,\u201d Saleh told him. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to end up a taxi driver like I did because I didn\u2019t finish school.\u201d\n\nNow his boy had vanished.\n\nSaleh\u2019s eldest son, Zayad, and a brother-in-law, Nabil, drove out to search the roads. The two were in the army together, on a week\u2019s leave from a front-line unit fighting the Houthi rebels. At every army checkpoint along the way, they described Abdullah to the soldiers, asking if they\u2019d seen him: A tall, lanky boy, baby face, not a trace of whiskers?\n\nFinally, a soldier outside Ataq said yes. He\u2019d seen him passing in a car. It was welcome news: At least they knew Abdullah had made it this far.\n\nSaleh headed for Ataq in his taxi. There, he joined his relatives, searching in the markets and at taxi stands, going street by street, alley by alley through the city. He spoke little, growing more tense with every futile turn.\n\nAs night fell, they gathered at the home of Saleh\u2019s brother in the Russian Compound, a housing complex on the city\u2019s edge, built in the 1980s when Soviet experts were here searching for oil. Zayad called his mother. Still nothing, he told her.\n\nMohsanaa told him to stay there and wait until morning to resume the search. She didn\u2019t want them driving around in the dark.\n\n\u201cThings happen at night,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nOn the outskirts of Ataq, Abdullah and his friend met a militant, who drove them in a Land Cruiser along a desert highway to Mosaynaa, through an area where Abdullah had never been before. He realized he had been gone for a long time and hadn\u2019t told his parents where he was. He thought about turning back but didn\u2019t have the nerve to say anything.\n\nThey passed through Mosaynaa, and the car wove up into the mountains to the al-Qaida fighters\u2019 camp. In a tent, they all had a meal of chicken and rice and Pepsi, but there were no motorcycles. It was too late to leave, so they would have to stay the night. The militants gave the boys a phone to send a message to their parents, and Abdullah texted his father: \u201cI am with al-Qaida. I\u2019ll come back tomorrow. Don\u2019t come for me.\u201d\n\nThe boys were offered a tent, but decided to sleep in a nearby crevasse, under some trees. They were worried about airstrikes.\n\n___\n\nWhen he received the message in Ataq, Abdullah\u2019s father tried calling back to the militant\u2019s phone. It was turned off. They had to move right away, Saleh told his relatives, or else \u201cI won\u2019t be able to get him back.\u201d Once in al-Qaida\u2019s hands, Abdullah would be gone forever, sent to fight the Houthis or strapped with a suicide belt \u2014 or he might be hit by a drone.\n\nWith al-Qaida, \u201call roads lead to death,\u201d said one of Saleh\u2019s nephews.\n\nDespite his wife\u2019s warnings, Saleh got back into the taxi and drove into the night, joined by Zayad and Nabil, along with two of Saleh\u2019s nephews who offered to help.\n\nThe search party asked around the shops and eateries still open in the markets. They learned that the boys had been there hours earlier, heading for the mountains.\n\nSaleh had never been to Mosaynaa and didn\u2019t have the tribal links needed to find his son. He needed local help, so he went to one of the few families he knew, the al-Tolsi family.\n\nThe al-Tolsi brothers were beekeepers, a common trade in Yemen, a country known for its honey. One of the brothers had links to al-Qaida, but he wasn\u2019t there when Saleh and his relatives appeared at the door of the family house. Instead, it was another brother, named Mubarak.\n\nMubarak was not connected to al-Qaida and had status in the community, working as the imam at the local mosque and performing the daily call to prayer. He welcomed the men in and offered them dinner. Over the meal, his guests explained why they had come. Mubarak said he was happy to take them to the mountains in the morning. It was too dark now. But Saleh was insistent.\n\nMubarak gave in. The beekeeper and his nephew, Naguib, a geology student at a local oil university, joined them, setting out at 10 p.m. At the foot of the mountains, they sought out a local man known to be a look-out for al-Qaida. He belonged to the same tribe as Mubarak, so they knew they could ask him to take a message to the militants: There is a man here who wants his son back.\n\nAs the look-out went up the mountain, the seven of them waited below in Saleh\u2019s taxi.\n\n___\n\nAt around 11:30 p.m., an operator pressed a button in a U.S. military base \u2014 perhaps in neighboring Saudi Arabia, perhaps as far away as Nevada or Georgia \u2014 launching two Hellfire missiles from a drone cruising above the mountain. Abdullah heard explosions in the valley and, terrified, started to cry.\n\nThe hours passed slowly to daybreak, when Abdullah and his friend made their way down the mountain. Part way down, they saw a mangled car below. At the bottom, Abdullah recognized the license plate: His father\u2019s taxi.\n\nThe missiles had reduced the car to burned wreckage. Abdullah\u2019s father and brother and the other five people inside were torn to pieces.\n\nThere were no bodies. Overnight, militants had rushed to the site and taken the remains to Mosaynaa, but their blood was everywhere.\n\n\u201cIt was shocking. I wept,\u201d Abdullah said. \u201cI realized he had come looking for me.\u201d\n\n____\n\nNews of the deaths in a drone strike fanned out across the district, passed by WhatsApp messages and phone calls.\n\nOne of Mubarak\u2019s brothers, Ahmed al-Tolsi, was away in the neighboring province of Marib, taking their bees to flowers there. He got a message and rushed home to Mosaynaa to bury his kin.\n\n\u201cHe is a generous man who received this family, gave them dinner and told them he would help them bring back their child,\u201d he said of Mubarak. \u201cHe was doing something good and got killed.\u201d\n\nIn Ataq, one of Saleh\u2019s nephews heard a knock on the door at dawn. \u201cYour brothers and uncle are in God\u2019s embrace,\u201d a neighbor said.\n\nThe remains of Saleh and his relatives were taken to the town of Yashbom, where Abdullah\u2019s odyssey began, and laid out under sheets in the mosque. Saleh\u2019s legs were gone; Zayad\u2019s body was cut in half.\n\nIn keeping with Muslim custom, the five were buried right away in the Yashbom cemetery.\n\nAbdullah\u2019s mother woke at dawn for morning prayers, still worrying about Abdullah. At 7:30 a.m., neighbors arrived dressed in black for mourning and told her the news: Saleh and the others had been hit by the drone. They were all dead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible. We talked in the evening,\u201d Mohsanaa said. \u201cI told them not to go out at night.\u201d\n\nShe was terrified that Abdullah had been killed as well.\n\nThen Abdullah appeared. He had walked four hours to get home and found the crowd of mourners gathered at his house. He sat alone under a tree nearby, trembling, afraid he would be blamed, until the men went over and reassured him. Mohsanaa had her son sit beside her and placed her hands on his head.\n\nTribal leaders sent emissaries to the al-Qaida fighters to demand they leave the area. But months later, Abdullah still blamed himself, not al-Qaida or the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt was my all mistake,\u201d Abdullah said. He speaks in short, muddled sentences, stooped over and looking down at his fingers.\n\n\u201cI was the reason why my father and brother, my uncle and cousins all died.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed that it carried out a strike in Shabwa province on Jan. 26, saying it was targeting al-Qaida. It does not release details or death tolls in drone strikes, spokeswoman Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich said.\n\nEver since, the families have tried to prove their slain loved ones were not militants. They gathered letters from everyone they could \u2014 police officers, district officials, tribal leaders, school principals \u2014 certifying that their relatives did not belong to al-Qaida. They spoke to human rights groups and the International Committee of the Red Cross, asking for an investigation.\n\nThey even held a demonstration in Ataq, attended by some 200 people, reading out a statement demanding the U.S. acknowledge that the victims were not al-Qaida and pay compensation to the families.\n\nTheir voices have not been heard. The U.S military has an official mechanism for families to request compensation for relatives mistakenly killed \u2014 a few families in Iraq and Pakistan have succeeded \u2014 but there is no U.S. Embassy in Yemen, so there is nowhere for Saleh\u2019s family to submit evidence that they were civilians.\n\nAbdullah\u2019s family has shards of the missiles that killed the seven men. They keep the shrapnel printed with serial numbers wrapped in a blanket hoping one day to present it as evidence in an investigation.\n\nMohsanaa doesn\u2019t believe she\u2019ll ever see justice for the killing. With her husband gone, she scrapes by on a meager pension and tries to manage her family\u2019s grief. She doesn\u2019t speak of the killing in front of Abdullah. A pious woman, she knows he mustn\u2019t blame himself.\n\n\u201cThis is God\u2019s verdict. If it wasn\u2019t written, they wouldn\u2019t have gone,\u201d Mohsanaa said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the child\u2019s guilt? He is a victim. He\u2019s a poor boy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lee Keath in Cairo contributed.", "BERLIN (AP) \u2014 Germany\u2019s economy shrank slightly in the third quarter of 2018, the first quarterly decline since early 2015, due to declining exports and bottlenecks in getting new cars certified under tougher emissions tests.\n\nThe Federal Statistical Office reported Wednesday that economic output fell by 0.2 percent in the third quarter. The agency said exports were down and imports were up in the third quarter, meaning there was a net drag coming from trade compared with the previous three-month period.\n\nThe economy ministry said in a statement that \u201cone-time effects in the third quarter lead to an interruption of the upswing\u201d as major automakers including Daimler and Volkswagen had difficulty getting new cars certified under tougher emissions testing standards. That led them to discount cars ahead of the Sept. 1 test deadline, and caused a shortage of cars to sell to consumers afterward.\n\nMoritz Degler, an economist at Oxford Economics, said that the drop in auto production and its knock-on effects through the industry\u2019s supply chain could have taken a half-percentage point off gross domestic product.\n\n\u201cThis implies that the economy didn\u2019t slow much from 0.5 percent growth (in the second quarter),\u201d he said.\n\nHe foresaw the economy bouncing back to 0.6 percent growth in the fourth quarter as the auto impact fades: \u201cGermany\u2019s dire Q3 GDP figure is much more a reflection of the country\u2019s overreliance on an outsized automotive sector, than it would suggest a further decline in eurozone growth momentum.\u201d\n\nThe drop followed increases of 0.5 percent in the second quarter and 0.4 percent in the first. It comes as growth is slowing across the 19-country eurozone economy.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Once upon a time, Jerrod Heard had the \u201cjuice.\u201d\n\nHe was the quarterback of the future for the Texas Longhorns and he\u2019d just smashed Vince Young\u2019s single-game school record with 527 total yards against California. He could throw. He could run. He could do just about everything.\n\nThen all that juice dried up with a whole lot of losing. A fifth-year senior, Heard heads into his final home game this week against No. 18 Iowa State (6-3, 5-2 Big 12) as a fifth-option wide receiver and special teams guy for the No. 13 Longhorns (7-3, 5-2).\n\nBut he\u2019s still got the record. And he\u2019s earned a whole lot of respect from his teammates for stepping up with a career-high six catches last week against Texas Tech. One of them came in the game-winning touchdown drive.\n\n\u201cJerrod\u2019s always happy,\u201d senior defensive end Charles Omenihu said. \u201cI\u2019m happy for him. He got the opportunity to shine. He\u2019s a good soul.\u201d\n\nHeard\u2019s career was supposed to be more than that. On Tuesday, he looked back at what it became and still smiled at the experience.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t ask for a better journey,\u201d Heard said. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed every minute of it.\u201d\n\nOne of the top-rated dual-threat quarterbacks in the nation coming out of high school, Heard was recruited by Mack Brown and stuck with the Longhorns after Brown was fired and Charlie Strong came in. After redshirting for a year while fans called for him to play during a 6-7 season, Strong finally gave him the keys to the offense the second game of 2015.\n\nHe won his first start against Rice, then broke Young\u2019s hallowed record which had been set in the classic 2006 Rose Bowl win over Southern California. But even that was tainted just a bit.\n\nHeard scored three times against California, his last one a 45-yard sprint through the middle of the field for what should have been the game-tying touchdown. But kicker Nick Rose missed the extra point. Heard\u2019s biggest day as a Longhorn ended as a loss.\n\nHeard had at least pumped some life into the Texas offense. Until two weeks later when Texas got smashed 50-7 at TCU. Even after an upset win over Oklahoma, Texas got shut out at Iowa State. Heard started 10 games at quarterback and Texas finished 5-7. He finished the season on the bench with concussions symptoms.\n\nHis days as a quarterback were done.\n\nBy spring 2016, Strong had revamped his offense and brought in quarterback Shane Buechele. After sitting out that spring with a shoulder injury, Heard was no longer part of the quarterback competition and moved to wide receiver.\n\nHeard probably could have transferred to play quarterback elsewhere. He wasn\u2019t that far removed from a stellar high school career that could have landed him just about anywhere.\n\nHe never considered it. Heard wanted to stay at Texas and wanted to win games. He was willing to do it from different positions.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be down, because I didn\u2019t know how many guys I\u2019d bring down with me,\u201d Heard said. \u201cI really wanted for this university to win games and be a powerhouse ... I wanted to win a championship. I still think that can happen.\u201d\n\nHeard\u2019s first season at wide receiver was his best when he caught 24 passes and tied for the team lead with three touchdown receptions. But his role kept diminishing as the Texas offense got better. Until last Saturday, he\u2019d caught just three passes for 29 yards this season.\n\nHe was thrust into a big role against Texas Tech because of an ankle injury to Collin Johnson, who has 50 catches for 675 yards and five touchdowns.\n\n\u201cHe was our offensive MVP for the way that he played,\u201d coach Tom Herman said.\n\nHerman has made sure to keep Heard as a big presence in the locker room, putting him on the team\u2019s leadership council. No player has likely felt the highs and lows of a career like he has.

(AP) \u2014 Senior Dexter Williams has been through countless ups and downs during his four years at Notre Dame.\n\nInjury, suspension, an arrest, the emotions of helping his ailing mother \u2014 all of it has weighed down Williams at times. He has emerged just the same as the workhorse running back for the third-ranked Fighting Irish, and a key reason Notre Dame has legitimate hopes of making the playoff.\n\nIn a 42-13 rout of Florida State last week, Williams piled up a career-high 202 yards on just 20 carries, becoming the first running back to surpass 200 rushing yards against the Seminoles since 1982. Nicknamed \u201cJuice\u201d by his teammates, he had scoring runs of 58 and 32 yards.\n\n\u201cI told the offensive line to give me a crease, and I would make a couple of runs for them,\u201d said Williams, who already this season had touchdown runs of 97 and 31 yards against Virginia Tech and 45 yards against Stanford.\n\nWith four 100-plus yard performances in six games, Williams\u2019 per-game rushing average stands at 128.3 yards, which would rank fifth in the country if he had enough games to be included among the NCAA leaders. His 6.8 yards per carry would be 13th. He leads the Irish with 770 yards and 10 touchdowns, exceeding expectations as Notre Dame (10-0) prepares for Saturday\u2019s game at Yankee Stadium in New York against No. 12 Syracuse (8-2).\n\n\u201cHis nickname is \u2018Juice\u2019 for a reason,\u201d said Irish senior wide receiver Miles Boykin. \u201cHis energy is contagious.\u201d\n\nIt took Williams more than three years \u2014 and through plenty of adversity \u2014 to get to this point.\n\nIn 2016, Williams was one of five Irish players arrested for possession of marijuana during a traffic stop. An injury cost him three straight games in 2017, and he opened this season with a four-game suspension for violating unspecified team rules.\n\n\u201cMe missing four games, I had a chance to really just settle down and really think about what I wanted as a person,\u201d said Williams, adding that the depression and guilt he felt from disappointing his teammates was almost unbearable. \u201cIt really just took time and I just had to humble myself to continue to strive for greatness.\u201d\n\nReflection and maturation helped Williams find his footing, in both school and football. He is expected to graduate next month with his degree in Africana studies.\n\n\u201cJust growing up in his maturity, ownership and being accountable and responsible,\u201d coach Brian Kelly said.\n\nBut a mother\u2019s love, support and sacrifice were equally as important as anything Williams did on his own. Recognizing that her son was hurting as suspension loomed, Dexter\u2019s 60-year-old mother, Cheryl Williams, relocated to South Bend from her home near Orlando, Florida, and moved into an apartment with her son before the season.\n\nMother keeps son on track and well fed. Son watches over mom as she battles two incurable diseases \u2014 myasthenia gravis and pulmonary arterial hypertension, ailments doctors say will take her within the next few years.\n\n\u201cAs much as I can do off the field for her, and just being able to make her happy when I\u2019m playing the game of football, and just having her here has helped me out a lot,\u201d Dexter Williams said, \u201cand I\u2019m pretty sure it has helped her a lot too.\u201d\n\nDexter Williams cherishes every day he shares with his mother, and uses his fresh outlook to lift her spirits and fuel his newfound football success.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing like having a lot of love for your mother,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSo having her here with me brightens my day.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "Nashville Predators goaltender Pekka Rinne, right, of Finland, stops a shot by Anaheim Ducks' Andrew Cogliano during the second period of an NHL hockey game, Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, in Anaheim, Calif. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Pekka Rinne is off to an even better start than last season when he finally won the Vezina Trophy as the NHL\u2019s best goalie, and backup Juuse Saros ranks among the league\u2019s top 10 for victories.\n\nWith both goalies now signed to contract extensions, the Nashville Predators may have the best goalie situation both on and off the ice.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s tandems that are much better than others, Nashville has one of them,\u201d said Martin Biron, a former NHL goalie and now Buffalo broadcaster. \u201cAnd I think if you\u2019re Peter Laviolette, if you\u2019re the goalie coach and the staff, your job and your challenge is to keep them at the highest of levels for the whole season.\u201d\n\nSo far, the defending Presidents\u2019 Trophy winners are doing just that.\n\nThe Predators went into Tuesday night\u2019s game in San Jose atop the league standings while also first in the NHL both in goals allowed (37) and 2.12 goals-against per game with Rinne and Saros (7-2-0) splitting the first 18 games. Rinne has been \u201cImPekkable\u201d with a 6-1-1 record, leading all goalies with at least eight starts with a 1.47 goals-against average and .951 save percentage.\n\n\u201cEvery day he is and continues to be the backbone of this organization and team and has probably had the biggest impact on this organization,\u201d Laviolette said.\n\nRinne is 3-0-1 with a .740 goals-against average and .976 save percentage and a shutout, stopping 121 of 124 shots faced since returning from injured reserve on Oct. 31. The Predators signed Rinne to a two-year extension taking him through 2020-21 on Nov. 3, and the goalie celebrated both the contract and his birthday with his second shutout of the season.\n\nBiron said Tuesday that he doesn\u2019t see a big competition for the starting job in Nashville.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Pekka\u2019s job, and Nashville giving him that two-year deal I think is basically saying that \u2018We want Pekka, and it\u2019s going to be like that,\u2019\u201d Biron said.\n\nRinne has been a Vezina finalist four of the past eight years, making the seven-year, $49 million contract he signed on an earlier birthday in 2011 worth every penny. That deal ties him for the fourth-priciest contract among goalies with Marc-Andre Fleury (33) of Vegas and Boston\u2019s Tuukka Rask (31). Fleury is under contract through 2021-22, and Rask hits free agency after the 2020-21 season.\n\nThe Predators signed Rinne to a two-year extension worth $10 million on Nov. 3. General manager David Poile also signed Saros, 23, to a three-year extension in July worth $4.5 million. That means Nashville is projected to drop from seventh with $8.5 million of its salary cap invested in goaltenders to ninth next season with a $6.5 million average annual value, according to Sportrac.com.\n\nRinne could\u2019ve pushed for more money. Montreal\u2019s Carey Price, 31, is getting $10.5 million a year, while Henrik Lundqvist of the Rangers is being paid $8.5 million a year through 2020-21.\n\nBiron calls Rinne one of the hardest-working goalies he\u2019s ever seen who\u2019s in unbelievable shape. He also sees Rinne simplifying his game as he got older, like Patrick Roy, Dominik Hasek and Eddie Belfour. Rinne still can scramble and react, which Biron thinks will keep Rinne playing at a high level for possibly four more years like Lundqvist.\n\n\u201cPekka can play at least through this next contract, and then after that we\u2019ll see,\u201d Biron said.\n\nIt\u2019s up to Nashville to make that extra cap space pay off after losing the 2017 Stanley Cup Final in six games and then in seven games in the second round last May. Poile persuaded defenseman Ryan Ellis to take a bit less money with an eight-year deal for $50 million in August, and his next task will be trying to get captain Roman Josi to agree to an extension next summer before the final year on the defenseman\u2019s current deal.\n\n\u201cHopefully this helps in a way that makes this team stay together moving forward,\u201d Rinne said. \u201cI think we have an opportunity to keep this same team. And I think that\u2019s David\u2019s goal and obviously I like the sound of it. I love this group, and I really think we have a chance this year and years to come.\u201d\n\nEARLY RETURNS\n\nTom Wilson of the Capitals returned to the lineup Tuesday night at Minnesota after arbitrator Shyam Das reduced the forward\u2019s suspension by six games to 14 for his illegal check to the head of St. Louis forward Oskar Sundqvist at the end of the preseason.\n\nHe made an immediate impact, scoring a first-period goal in a 5-2 victory.\n\nNashville forward Austin Watson is eligible to return to the ice Thursday night when the Predators wrap up a road trip in Arizona after Das cut his suspension from 27 games to 18 after he pleaded no contest in July to a domestic assault charge.\n\nDas is the same neutral arbitrator fired by Major League Baseball in 2012 after he overturned Ryan Braun\u2019s drug suspension. The NHL fired arbitrator James Oldham in 2016 after his decision to reduce Dennis Wideman\u2019s 20-game suspension to 10 for striking and injuring an official, and either the NHL or NHLPA can fire the neutral arbitrator after each season.\n\nNWHL ALL-STAR GAME\n\nThe Predators, who hosted the 2016 NHL All-Star Game, will be hosting the 2019 NWHL All-Star Weekend capped by an NHL-NWHL doubleheader on Feb. 10.

A drone struck a car carrying Ali who was returning to Marib with a relative after dropping his family at a house of relatives. Nearly 70 kilometers from Marib, at 3:00 p.m. the drone struck the car and killed the Ali the other driver survived. (Ali family via AP)\n\nATAQ, Yemen (AP) \u2014 The United States has waged a drone war in Yemen for 16 years, trying to suppress al-Qaida\u2019s branch here. But the campaign has had a hidden cost: civilians cut down by the drones\u2019 missiles.\n\nThere is no comprehensive count of civilian deaths because of the difficulty of confirming identities and allegiances of those killed. But in an examination of drone strikes this year alone, The Associated Press found that at least 30 of the dead likely did not belong to al-Qaida.\n\nThat is around a third of all those killed in drone strikes so far in 2018. The Pentagon does not release its assessment of the death toll, but an independent database considered one of the most credible in tracking violence in Yemen counted 88 people \u2014 militants and non-militants \u2014 killed by drones this year.\n\nThe AP count gives a glimpse, even if incomplete, into how often civilians are mistakenly hit by drone strikes, at a time when the Trump administration has dramatically ramped up the use of armed drones. It has carried out 176 strikes during its nearly two years in office, compared to the 154 strikes during the entire eight years of the Obama administration, according to a count by the AP and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.\n\nThe AP based its count on interviews with witnesses, families, tribal leaders and activists. Most of those killed, 24, were civilians; at least 6 others were fighters in pro-government forces \u2014 meaning ostensibly on the same side as the U.S. \u2014 who were hit in strikes away from the front lines while engaged in civilian life.\n\n___\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting\n\n___\n\nThe drone toll goes almost unnoticed in the region\u2019s conflicts. Immensely greater destruction has been wreaked by U.S. allies in the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s air campaign against Iranian-backed Shiite rebels known as Houthis. More than 57,000 civilians and combatants have been killed in Yemen\u2019s civil war, by some estimates, and thousands more may have died of starvation caused by the conflict.\n\nYet the killing of a single man \u2014 Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, slain by Saudi operatives in his own country\u2019s consulate \u2014 has raised more international uproar than any of those deaths in a war waged by a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and baked by the U.S.\n\nIn comparison, the toll from U.S drones in Yemen runs in the hundreds, including both militants and civilians. Several databases are trying to track the deaths, with varying results. The Bureau for Investigative Journalism counted up to 1,020 killed by strikes from 2009 to 2016, under President Barack Obama, compared to up to 205 killed in 2017 and 2018. Another database, by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, counted 331 killed the past two years.\n\nCounting civilians among those numbers is complicated by the difficulty in determining who belongs to al-Qaida in a country of multiple warring militias. Al-Qaida has joined the battle against the Houthis, and many of its fighters are incorporated into militias armed and funded by the U.S.-backed coalition.\n\nThe campaign has scored some military successes. In 2015, U.S. strikes took out Nasser al-Wahishi, the top leader of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP as the Yemeni branch is known, and several senior lieutenants.\n\nBut drones have been most effective in forcing al-Qaida to limit its movements and hide in the mountains, avoid large gatherings and restrict cellphone use. The group withdrew from areas it controlled in the south but was allowed to keep weapons and money under secret deals it struck with the United Arab Emirates, a coalition member.\n\nOver the years, the cost of the pursuit of senior leadership has been high.\n\nFor example, the U.S. has killed at least 66 civilians, 31 of them children, in the unsuccessful hunt for one man, Qassim al-Rimi, one of AQAP\u2019s founders who in 2015 succeeded al-Wahishi as the group\u2019s chief.\n\nThose deaths came in two raids reportedly targeting al-Rimi. The first was in 2009 in the southern village of al-Majalah. The second came on Jan 27, 2017, only days after Trump\u2019s inauguration, in a U.S. special forces assault on a village in Bayda province.\n\nThe civilian deaths come in a war conducted from a vast distance.\n\nDrone pilots work remotely at American bases, most often in the U.S., sometimes on 11- to 14-hour shifts housed in rooms like shipping containers lined with electronics. They operate based on intelligence from informants but they also carry out so-called \u201csignature strikes,\u201d based on observing suspicious patterns of behavior. They have a list of characteristics, and if a subject on the ground shows a number of them, he could be targeted, a former participant to the drone program told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the operations.\n\nMistakes happen from bad intel or misjudging behavior, he said. Rights groups have expressed concern that some of the intelligence may come from prisoners held in jails run by Emirati-backed militias where torture is widespread.\n\nSome of the strikes from 2018 that the AP examined appeared to be mistakes.\n\nOn Jan. 1, a drone missile slammed into a farm in Bayda province where 70-year-old Mohammed Mansar Abu Sarima sat with a younger relative, killing both, according to a relative, Mohammed Abu Sarima.\n\nThe slain men had just returned from mediating a local dispute. In a country where tribal links are powerful and the justice system nearly non-existent, such mediations are common to resolve conflicts over land or deaths. They involve large gatherings of tribesmen who are often armed, potentially raising drone operators\u2019 suspicions.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any affiliation. They are simple farmers who don\u2019t know how to read or write,\u201d said the brother. \u201cWe live in fear. Drones don\u2019t leave the sky.\u201d\n\nSeveral weeks later, a 14-year-old shepherd, Yahia al-Hassbi, was struck by a drone as he tended goats several kilometers (miles) from a checkpoint that al-Qaida had tried recently to seize. He was killed along with a construction worker passing by at the time, according to relatives and three local human rights workers, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\nFurther east, in Hadramawt province, drones carried out several consecutive days of strikes in March, targeting vehicles on a main highway. Some of the strikes killed al-Qaida militants, according to rights activists in the area.\n\nBut others struck down cars carrying people who had fled to the area from a nearby province, Jawf, to escape fighting. A drone\u2019s missile on March 5 killed a 10-year-old boy, Ammer al-Mahshami, and wounded the driver, according to three relatives. Four days later, another car was hit, killing six men and boys, including a 14-year-old and an 18-year-old, travelling to a funeral.\n\nSaleh al-Wahir, the brother of one of the dead, was in a car behind them. \u201cI saw it before my eyes,\u201d he said of the blast. \u201cBodies were ripped apart.\u201d A report from the Jawf Human Rights office concluded the men were civilians.\n\nSurvivors are rare. Adel al-Mandhari recounted how his car was thrown through the air by the blast of a drone\u2019s missile. He lost his legs and an arm and was burned all over his body. The four others in the car \u2014 his brother, uncle, cousin and another relative \u2014 were all killed. None were connected to al-Qaida, said al-Mandhari, a civil servant. Two other relatives and the three rights workers in Bayda confirmed his account.\n\nSince the attack, al-Mandhari has spoken to the media and rights groups, seeking ways to get compensation and an apology from the U.S. \u201cI lost hope,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing is going to happen.\u201d\n\nEven some strikes that the AP did not include in its count may have killed civilians, though there is some dispute over them.\n\nOn May 14, two men, Hussein al-Dayani and Abdullah al-Karbi, were killed when a drone struck their pickup truck in an area of Shabwa province where al-Qaida is known to have a presence.\n\nAl-Dayani\u2019s brother, Khaled, denied they were militants. He said his brother was a fighter in a militia battling the Houthis. \u201cWe are against those people,\u201d Khaled said of al-Qaida.\n\nTwo weeks later, a 17-year-old, Mahdar Hussein al-Hag, died in a strike while driving his motorcycle in the same area. Mahdar\u2019s father said he was a high school student and was returning from buying vegetables. \u201cHe might have been mistaken for al-Qaida youth who are active in this area.\u201d\n\nA Yemeni security official said the dead in those strikes were all al-Qaida members, though he did not provide evidence. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press.", "U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, right, meets Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Singapore, Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018.

(Nov. 14)\n\nA day earlier Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed made an unusually harsh public criticism of Suu Kyi, saying that as a former political prisoner she should better understand suffering. He said the treatment of the Rohingya was \u201cindefensible.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Mahathir toned down his comments, saying that ASEAN leaders try to avoid criticizing each other. He said the issue of Rohingya had come up during a working dinner among the leaders but the main sentiment was a desire to resolve the problem.\n\nSuu Kyi became an icon for democracy after spending about 15 years under house arrest for opposing Myanmar\u2019s earlier military dictatorship.\n\nThough she has been the de facto head of Myanmar\u2019s civilian government since her party swept elections in 2015, she is limited in her control of the country by a constitution written under the former military junta. The military is in charge of security operations, including those in Rakhine.\n\nStill, Suu Kyi has faced widespread criticism for not speaking out in defense of the Rohingya. Amnesty International became the latest organization to strip her of an award this week, citing the \u201cshameful betrayal of the values she once stood for.\u201d\n\nResponding to Pence, Suu Kyi said it was good to exchange views, but that \u201cwe understand our country better than any other country does. I\u2019m sure you will say the same of yours, that you understand your own country better than anybody else.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we are in a better position to explain to you what is happening, how we see things panning out,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter the meeting, senior U.S. administration officials said Pence and Suu Kyi had discussed the importance of having Rohingya return home, but only on a voluntary basis, with safety and dignity.\n\nPence also urged Suu Kyi to pardon the imprisoned journalists.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s government and most of the nation\u2019s Buddhist majority say Rohingya are \u201cBengalis\u201d who migrated illegally from Bangladesh, and do not acknowledge the Muslim minority as a local ethnic group even though they have lived in Myanmar for generations.\n\nA Bangladesh official said Wednesday that authorities are ready to begin repatriating more than 2,200 Rohingya refugees to Myanmar. Bangladesh repatriation commissioner Abul Kalam said 30 refugee families would be transferred Thursday at the Gundrum border point near Cox\u2019s Bazar, where refugees have been living in cramped camps.\n\nU.N. officials have urged Bangladesh to move cautiously on the repatriation plans, saying such a move would endanger their lives.\n\nThe office of U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said it continues to receive reports of rights violations in Rakhine state, \u201cwhich include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests.\u201d It said some 130,000 people, including many Rohingya, remain internally displaced in central Rakhine.\n\nThe U.N. refugee agency UNHCR also has advised against the returns, saying safety should be assessed first.

(AP) \u2014 On a night when he reached an impressive personal milestone, Joe Thornton wasn\u2019t taking stock of his career accomplishments.\n\nThe veteran San Jose Sharks center even bristled when asked about it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to improve my game, to be honest with you,\u201d he said.\n\nAll that hard work is still paying off.\n\nThornton broke a third-period tie with his 400th goal, Joe Pavelski scored twice and the Sharks defeated the Nashville Predators 5-4 on Tuesday after squandering a three-goal lead.\n\nMarcus Sorensen and Antti Suomela also scored to help San Jose win its second straight and fourth in six games. Sorensen had two assists to give him six points (two goals, four assists) over his last three games.\n\nThe 39-year-old Thornton is anchoring a third line that includes Sorensen (26) and Kevin Labanc (22).\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care who I play with, I just want to play and enjoy it and have fun.

Meanwhile, only blocks to the east, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency holds its only public hearing on the Trump administration's plans to roll back Obama-era rules for methane pollution from the oil and gas industry. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 Dozens of people who live near oil and gas wells pleaded with the Trump administration Wednesday not to roll back rules for methane pollution, while industry representatives said the changes should go further.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency held a hearing in Denver on the administration\u2019s plans to loosen regulations imposed by the Obama administration in 2016. The rules require energy companies to step up the detection and elimination of methane leaks at well sites and other oil and gas facilities.\n\nMethane is the primary component of natural gas and also is a greenhouse gas.\n\nOpponents argued Wednesday that changing the rules would threaten people\u2019s health, worsen climate change and squander natural gas by allowing leaks to go undetected. They also argued it would cost taxpayers, investors and mineral owners money from the lost sale of the gas.\n\nMany accused the EPA of abetting polluters, looking out for the wealthy and failing its legal duty to protect public health and the environment.\n\n\u201cPolluters do not need your protection. I do,\u201d said 15-year-old Alexis Elliott, who said emissions from oil and gas wells near her school in McDonald, Pennsylvania, caused her nosebleeds, joint swelling, vision problems and other health effects.\n\nSusann Beug told agency officials, \u201cThe EPA is the Environmental Protection Agency, not the Energy Protection Agency.\u201d\n\nMatthew Todd of the American Petroleum Institute said the industry is already voluntarily reducing methane emissions even while natural gas production is increasing.\n\n\u201cWe fully expect that progress will continue,\u201d he said.\n\nTodd said the EPA should do more to allow technological innovation and streamline the rules.\n\nWhen it unveiled the new, looser rules in September, the EPA said they would save energy companies up to $75 million a year. The agency conceded that the rules \u201cmay also degrade air quality and adversely affect health and welfare\u201d but said it could not quantify the potential health effects because of data limitations.\n\nCritics of the proposed changes \u2014 who appeared to heavily outnumber supporters at the hearing \u2014 scoffed at some of those assertions.\n\nSarah Smith of the Clean Air Task Force said health problems are not just a possibility but a certainty if the rules are relaxed. She also argued that the agency has the ability to calculate the impacts.\n\nThe EPA has said the new rules would allow an additional 380,000 U.S. tons (350,000 metric tons) of methane and 100,000 U.S. tons (91,000 metric tons of volatile organic compounds into the atmosphere from 2019 to 2025. Volatile organic compounds an ingredient of ozone or smog.\n\nThe EPA wants to reduce the frequency of inspections for methane leaks and give energy companies more time to repair leaks after they are detected. The changes would also allow an energy company\u2019s in-house engineers to certify some aspects of methane control instead of requiring an outside professional engineer to do so.\n\nThe EPA also wants to let energy companies opt to follow state rules instead of the federal rules in California, Colorado, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Utah.\n\nThe EPA rules apply to oil and gas drilling on private land and some public land.\n\nThe administration is also relaxing a separate set of methane rules imposed by the Interior Department on oil and gas drilling on U.S. public lands and tribal lands.\n\nLoosening the methane rules is part of a broad effort by the Trump administration to roll back environmental protections, particularly ones that apply to coal, oil and gas.\n\nThe hearing in Denver is the only one the EPA has scheduled. Some people urged the agency to hold more sessions in other cities.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show Alexis Elliott is 15, not 13.\n\n___\n\nFollow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP.", "TEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 Iran executed the so-called \u201cSultan of Coins\u201d and his accomplice on Wednesday for hoarding gold coins and other hard currency, signaling zero tolerance as it tries to shore up its currency in the face of an economic crisis.\n\nState TV reported that Vahid Mazloumin and his accomplice, Mohammad Ismail Ghasemi, were hanged early Wednesday.

The shooting triggered the mass murders and suicides in Jonestown of more than 900 people orchestrated by the Rev. Jim Jones.\n\nThen-San Francisco Examiner reporter Tim Reiterman was wounded in the airstrip shooting and flown to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, where he wrote the following eyewitness account. It appeared in the Examiner on Nov. 20, 1978, two days after the tragedy:\n\n___\n\nExclusive: Eyewitness account of massacre\n\nBy Tim Reiterman, Examiner Staff Writer\n\nPORT KAITUMA, Guyana \u2014 \u201cI feel sorry that we are being destroyed from within,\u201d the Rev. Jim Jones had said as a tropical storm rained on the Peoples Temple pavilion.\n\nJones had suffered a setback. Rep. Leo Ryan, D-San Mateo, had come to the temple\u2019s agricultural project to determine whether the followers of Jones were free to leave the jungle settlement. And now some wanted to depart.\n\nJournalist who traveled to Jonestown recalls tragedy. (AP)\n\nWe couldn\u2019t know then that the grim little world of this sick man would shatter within hours, taking hundreds of his followers to their deaths. My companion, Examiner photographer Greg Robinson, would be murdered in an ambush. So would the congressman and three others.\n\nI wondered why it happened. My best guess is that Jones felt the press people weren\u2019t fooled by the staged setup at the mission. After all, we had seen things we weren\u2019t supposed to see. We demanded to see the locked buildings where some members lived in crowd, uncomfortable conditions.\n\nJones wasn\u2019t the same man. His handshake was weak. He was taking pain pills, and he said he was dying.\n\nNone of it makes sense. All I can do is tell what I saw and heard.\n\nIt began with a note smuggled to us from two members. The note said: \u201cPlease help us get out of Jonestown.\u201d The list of defectors rapidly grew to at least 16. According to former members, Jones would not tolerate defections from the mission project and many of the church members considered those who leave to be traitors.\n\nAt the end of Ryan\u2019s two-day visit to the mission Saturday, a woman suddenly charged down a slippery boardwalk shouting at her husband, \u201cI\u2019ll kill you! I\u2019ll kill you! Don\u2019t take my baby!\u201d\n\nAn emotional tug-of-war ensued between a mother who wanted to stay and the father who wanted to go. Finally, attorneys for both Ryan and the temple decreed that the courtroom was the proper place to decide the custody issue.\n\nThough it was a stalemate, the incident intensified an already strained situation. Jones, who asked his followers to call him \u201cDad,\u201d did not like to lose any of his \u201cchildren.\u201d He said he considered it a failing on his part when he did.\n\nSome scowling faces appeared in the windows that rainy afternoon, watching the defectors leave, some with trunks and others with little more than the clothes on their backs.\n\nAll of us were falling and slipping through the mud around a six-wheel-drive dump truck that would take us (the congressional delegation, the press, the defectors and a group of concerned relatives of temple members) to the Port Kaituma airstrip.\n\nIn minutes, the back of the truck was piled high with crates, suitcases, backpacks and people. Mud made the truck bed slick, so everyone clung to the sideboards.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d someone shouted, and the driver attempted to turn the truck around. The truck spun its wheels until a Caterpillar tractor tugged it into place for a downhill run.\n\nBut before we could start out, we heard angry shouts. People raced over to the outdoor pavilion.\n\nA few of us jumped from the truck and ran over there. We got word that a temple member had grabbed the congressman, held a knife to his throat and told him he was going to slit it. Temple attorneys Charles Garry and Mark Lane, along with Ryan, subdued the man.\n\nWe were turned back by Johnny Jones, Jim Jones\u2019 stern-faced adopted black son. He said reporters would make the situation worse.\n\nA few minutes later a pale-looking Leo Ryan slogged through the mud with his briefcase, his powder blue shirt and pants stained with his assailant\u2019s blood. He climbed aboard the truck and we took off.\n\nRyan had planned to remain behind at the mission with several members who wished to return to the United States but couldn\u2019t get seating on the planes. His unplanned departure left them alone.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in deep trouble now,\u201d observed one of the relatives who had accompanied us.\n\nDuring the bouncy ride out, former temple members said that one of the supposed defectors, Larry Layton, was a Jones loyalist and had been depressed.\n\n\u201cWatch him,\u201d those around him were told. \u201cWe think he\u2019s got a gun. He\u2019s too close to Jim Jones to leave.\u201d\n\nA large poncho covered his belt area so no one knew for sure and no one challenged him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m real happy to be getting out,\u201d Layton volunteered, then lapsed into a stare. A while later, the young temple escort on the tailgate shook his head and said: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they did it this way. They could leave any time they want.\u201d\n\nIt seemed the temple was generous: It willingly provided passports to those who wished to leave, and advanced $5,000 to help defray transportation costs. We\u2019d also just seen the warm, cheerful embraces between some of those leaving and some who were staying.\n\nAt the temple-exit guard post, the truck was halted. A black man with a \u201ccorn rows\u201d hairstyle came up to the rear of the truck. Joining him was an older black man who fingered something in his right pocket.\n\nThe younger man demanded that everyone in the truck move aside. He apparently was searching for his wife, who had carried away their child that morning, hoping to escape the settlement. But she wasn\u2019t in the truck and the men left.\n\nWhen the truck was allowed to pass, we all breathed easier. Some had the distinct impression that the two were close to opening fire on the truck.\n\nAs we rode onto the black gravel, jungle-bordered runway, a small six-passenger Cessna was parked to one side of the corrugated metal shack which served as the airport terminal.\n\nA second plane, a Guyana Airways 24-seater, was coming in for a landing. At the far end of the strip sat a yellow government plane. Its nose wheel had been broken the week before and four soldiers were guarding it with M-I6 rifles.\n\nAs the larger plane landed, the temple truck, with several persons in the back, started to advance. Alongside it was a red tractor and trailer seen earlier at the mission.\n\nSome of those leaving the temple eyed the vehicles with suspicion. NBC reporter Don Harris said coolly: \u201cI think we\u2019re in for some trouble.\u201d\n\nSeating assignments were chosen after Ryan briefed the press on the knife attack and credited Mark Lane with saving his life. Ryan clearly was in good spirits.\n\nHe was within a few minutes and a few yards of accomplishing his goal: to get out temple members who were afraid to leave or possibly held against their will.\n\nFirst the Cessna was filled, with Ryan frisking each boarder looking for guns and knives. Layton, who was insisting on taking the first plane, slipped to the other side of the plane before he could be frisked. When that was pointed out to Ryan, Layton contended he already had been frisked. Yet he submitted to a new search, then returned to his seat.\n\nMeanwhile, the tractor, with several men in the trailer, rolled toward the terminal shack and halted a short distance away. Quietly the men with the tractor motioned aside a group of curious Guyanese children and other bystanders. Some of the defectors told me later that the men in the trailer were members of Peoples Temple.\n\n\u201cIt looks like trouble,\u201d I said to Greg Robinson, but he kept on shooting pictures.\n\nAs rapidly as possible Jacqueline Speier was signing on passengers at the fool of the boarding ladder while a reporter helped her check for weapons. The closest thing to a law enforcement official \u2014 a pleasant young policeman with a pink shirt and a 16-gauge shotgun \u2014 was disarmed by temple members.\n\nThen, with heart-stopping suddenness, the first shot was fired. I didn\u2019t see who fired the shot but the sound came from the tractor and trailer.\n\nA loud series of pops echoed across the field.\n\n\u201cHit the deck!\u201d someone hollered as we scrambled over the gravel to the far side of the plane. I dropped to my belly. A bullet ripped through my left forearm. Another hit my wrist and knocked off my watch.\n\nThey were shooting to kill, not just to stop us from leaving.\n\nSpringing to my feet, I ran 40 yards across the runway. Volleys of shotgun, rifle and pistol fire kept coming. I dove headlong into the three-foot-tall grass.\n\nI crawled until I came to taller bushes and brambles, clawing my way into a pocket in the brush.\n\nI stopped and listened. The shots still were popping at an amazing clip. I could still hear the groaning and crying of the targets.\n\nThough I couldn\u2019t see over the tall brush, I could hear the shots become less frequent. Then there were just a few.\n\nMy arm was gushing blood so I stripped off my belt and pinched down the biggest wounds.\n\nI heard a few more shots and saw the tractor pull away. After they left, I crept out of the bush and saw five bodies around the plane. Other people were injured.\n\nGreg\u2019s body was near the boarding steps with his camera bag and cameras scattered around him. There was a gaping wound in his shoulder and possibly his ribs.\n\nRyan, his thick gray hair bloodied, was near the front of the plane. Harris, a Los Angeles-based NBC investigative reporter who covered the fall of Saigon and the Nicaragua rebellion, had been killed. It was Harris who had been contacted by the first two groups of temple members expressing a desire to leave.\n\nAlso dead was Bob Brown, the NBC cameraman and the kind of guy who loved action stories.\n\nPatricia Parks had had her head shattered before her husband\u2019s eyes.\n\nFive others were wounded seriously. Speier\u2019s right leg had a gaping wound, and her arm was injured. NBC sound man Steve Sung had chunks of one arm blown away. Anthony Katsaris, brother of Jim Jones aide Maria Katsaris, was wounded in the chest.\n\nVernon Gosney and Monica Bagby, the two temple members who asked for help in the note, also were seriously injured.\n\nAfter the massacre, Layton strolled back to the area.\n\n\u201cHe started firing at the front and missed the pilot,\u201d said Dale Parks, who left the temple Saturday. \u201cHe hit Monica and Vern. He fired at me, but it misfired. I jumped up and fought for the gun. He went over the seats in a somersault and I flipped out of the plane with him. I got the gun. I tried to fire \u2014 but nothing happened.\u201d\n\nLayton later was taken into custody by Guyanese authorities who seized a .38-caliber pistol and turned it over to U.S. Embassy officials.\n\nBy nightfall, the seriously wounded, some of them on litters provided by the community, were sheltered in army soldiers\u2019 tents. The rest of us were accommodated in a private home.\n\n\u201cWe were so scared, too, man, that they\u2019d do this to you,\u201d said one of the people who took us in.\n\nGuyanese civilians set up a guard station for us, standing watch all night armed with only a shotgun, a machete and a long-bladed knife. More than a few bottles of rum were consumed or poured on wounds.

As a self-taught bulldozer operator, he worked alongside other Peoples Temple members in the humid heat, his blade carving roads and sites for wooden buildings with metal roofs.

Jim Jones \u2014 charismatic, volatile, and ultimately evil. It was he who dreamed up Jonestown, he who willed it into being, and he who brought it down: First, with the assassination of U.S. Rep. Leo Ryan and four others by temple members on a nearby airstrip on Nov. 18, 1978, then with the mass murders and suicides of hundreds, a horror that remains nearly unimaginable 40 years later.\n\nBut some lived \u2014 to struggle for decades with grief, guilt and the feeling that they were pariahs.\n\n___\n\nAt 16, Jordan Vilchez was put on the Planning Commission where the meetings were a strange mix of church business, sex talk \u2014 and adulation for Jones. \u201cWhat we were calling the cause really was Jim,\u201d she said.\n\nInstead of finishing high school, Vilchez moved to San Francisco, where she lived in the church. Then, after a 1977 New West magazine expose of temple disciplinary beatings and other abuses, she was sent to Jonestown.\n\nGrueling field work was not to her liking. Neither were the White Nights where everyone stayed up, armed with machetes to fight enemies who never arrived.\n\nVilchez was dispatched to the Guyanan capital of Georgetown to raise money. On Nov. 18 she was at the temple house when a fanatical Jones aide received a dire radio message from Jonestown. The murders and suicides were unfolding, 150 miles away. They must kill themselves.\n\nWithin minutes, the aide and her three children lay dead in a bloody bathroom, their throats slit.\n\nFor years, Vilchez was ashamed of the part she played in an idealistic group that imploded so terribly. \u201cEveryone participated in it and because of that, it went as far as it did,\u201d said Vilchez, an artist who worked 20 years in a private crime lab. This past year, she returned to long-overgrown Jonestown.

Stephan helped erect a basketball court and form a team. In the days before Ryan\u2019s fact-finding mission to the settlement, the players were in Georgetown for a tourney with the Guyana national teams.\n\nRebelling, they refused Jones\u2019 order to come back, believing nothing would happen or he was too cowardly to follow through with the oft-threatened \u201crevolutionary suicide.\u201d\n\nStephan Jones and some other team members believe they might have changed history if they were there. \u201cThe reality was we were folks who could be counted on to stand up,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way we would be shooting at the airstrip. That\u2019s what triggered it.\u201d\n\nHe went through years of nightmares, mourning and shame. To cope, he says he abused drugs and exercised obsessively. \u201cI focused my rage on Dad and his circle, rather than deal with me,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than 300 Jonestown victims were children. Now, Stephan Jones is father of three daughters, ages 16, 25 and 29, and works in the office furniture installation business.\n\nHe says his daughters have seen him gnash his teeth when he talks about his father, but they also have heard him speak lovingly of the man who taught him compassion and other virtues.\n\n\u201cPeople ask, \u2018How can you ever be proud of your father?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI just have to love him and forgive him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nJim Jones\u2019 adopted black son, Jim Jr., also was with the basketball team at the time of the massacre.

He remarried three decades ago, and he and his wife Erin raised three sons. He converted to Catholicism and registered Republican.

Israel plans to build a cable car to relieve traffic in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City. The project has united architects and Palestinian activists in opposition to a project they say is an eyesore to a picturesque landscape and a ploy to entrench Israeli control over the city\u2019s contested eastern sector.(AP Photo/Sebastian Scheiner, File)\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 An Israeli plan to build a cable car to Jerusalem\u2019s historic Old City has united architects and Palestinian activists in opposition to a project they say is both an eyesore and a ploy to entrench Israeli control over the city\u2019s contested eastern sector.\n\nDevelopers say the proposed project is meant to relieve snarling traffic and will ferry some 3,000 tourists an hour from the western sector directly to the Old City, in east Jerusalem. It follows a series of Israeli projects in the combustible city that have enraged the Palestinians.\n\nFurther complicating matters is the project\u2019s association with the Elad Foundation, a group that has settled Jewish nationalists in the heart of Jerusalem\u2019s Arab neighborhoods. The final cable car station will be integrated into a future tourist center run by the organization.\n\n\u201cThe cable car will send oblivious tourists flying over the heads of Palestinians and drop them off in the middle of occupied east Jerusalem, the eye of the storm, the .... center of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,\u201d said Betty Herschman of Ir Amim, an advocacy group that promotes equality in the city. \u201cThis cable car is putting new facts on the ground that undermine any possibility for a peace process.\u201d\n\nIsrael captured east Jerusalem, along with the limestone-walled Old City, in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it, a move never recognized internationally. The Palestinians claim the eastern sector as capital of a future state while Israel considers the entire city its eternal, undivided capital. The conflicting claims to east Jerusalem lie at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and have frequently spilled over into violence.\n\nIn recent years, Israel has carried out a series of initiatives, billed as development projects, that have infuriated the Palestinians. Israel built a light rail train through both parts of the city, abutting the Old City and snaking through predominantly Arab neighborhoods. The train is popular with Arabs and Jews, but it has also been the target of Palestinian rioters when tensions rise.\n\nAnother proposed plan involves digging a railway tunnel under Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, passing near sites holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims. The proposed line would end at the Western Wall, with a station named after President Donald Trump, who is cheered in Israel for having recognized Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nBeyond political opposition, the cable car has faced an outcry from urban planners and architects.\n\n\u201cThis project is an outrage, an affront to our historic skyline,\u201d said Moshe Safdie, a renowned architect who signed a petition against the plan along with 70 Israeli figures from architecture, archaeology and academia. \u201cThis will Disneyfy a sacred place. Imagine a huge cable car flying over the Vatican and dumping tourists in front of St. Peter\u2019s. It\u2019s unprecedented.\u201d\n\nNo image says Jerusalem like the postcard view of its Old City \u2014 with its towering ancient walls, the Western Wall and the glimmering gold-topped Dome of the Rock.\n\nThe cable car would run 1,400 meters (nearly one mile), launching from the First Station, a popular food and cultural center in west Jerusalem, sailing over the city\u2019s ancient valley, stopping at Mount Zion, a hill just outside the Old City walls, and proceeding through the Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan before alighting at the tourist center.\n\nAber Zayyad, a Palestinian resident of Silwan and director of its women\u2019s community center, said she fears the cable car flying overhead will infringe on residents\u2019 privacy and that its construction may harm houses and a local cemetery.\n\n\u201cOur tombs will likely be damaged, not to mention our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd of course it will further attempts to make Jerusalem a solely Jewish city.\u201d\n\nThe cable car\u2019s destination at the tourist center has sparked concern about the project\u2019s potential to serve settler interests by promoting Elad\u2019s exclusive Jewish narrative of the city.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this is an attempt to change the character of the city and its face ... its culture and identity,\u201d said Adnan Husseini, the Palestinian minister of Jerusalem Affairs.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Tourism Ministry denies any political motivation. It says the cable car presents an environmentally friendly solution to the crisis of congestion, accessibility and parking at a time of record-breaking tourist visits. The Old City is Israel\u2019s No. 1 tourist destination.\n\nIsrael\u2019s National Infrastructure Committee, which fast-tracks transportation projects of national importance, has given approval to the project. A building permit is to come after a 60-day period of public review \u2014 a step that developers believe will be a formality.\n\nIn May, Israel allocated some $55 million to the project and, barring major complications, cars should be crisscrossing the valley by 2021, the Tourism Ministry said.\n\nAmir Halevi, the ministry\u2019s director general, said he sympathizes with concerns about the sensitivity of the site but claimed that the rapidly rising tourism rates demand a dramatic response.\n\n\u201cThere is always the question of how to balance developing and preserving,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you cannot stop development.\u201d\n\nHalevi added that the Ministry mapped the cable car route carefully to \u201cminimize\u201d the evacuation and demolition of buildings.\n\nHe stressed the cable car would not enter the Old City or go over its walls, but would stop just outside. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this to prevent the need to construct more invasive things,\u201d he said.\n\nUrban planning experts disagree that the cable cars, which hold 10 people per carriage, will resolve the city\u2019s daunting transportation problems.\n\nSalmah Milson Arad, director of the Jerusalem chapter of the Association of Architects and Urban Planners, estimated the cable cars will relieve only around 30 percent of bus traffic.\n\nOther critics have questioned whether the massive undertaking will even appeal to customers.\n\n\u201cIsraelis come to the (Western) Wall in their cars, the ultra-Orthodox walk, Arabs won\u2019t use this, and it\u2019s hard to imagine tourists in massive buses going out of their way to get to First Station,\u201d said Giora Solar, architect and former director of conservation for Israel\u2019s Antiquities Authority. \u201cSo who\u2019s going to benefit?\u201d", "MONTGOMERY, Ala.

As a young, black girl and self-professed pop culture geek, she saw Lee was ahead of his time.\n\n\u201cAt the time, he wrote \u2018Black Panther\u2019 when segregation was still heavy,\u201d said the 27-year-old New Yorker who credits Lee with influencing her to become a graphic designer and comic book artist. \u201cIt was kind of unheard of to have a black lead character, let alone a title character and not just a secondary sidekick kind of thing.\u201d\n\nLee, the master and creator behind Marvel\u2019s biggest superheroes, died at age 95 on Monday. As fans celebrate his contributions to the pop culture canon, some have also revisited how the Marvel wizard felt that with great comic books came great responsibility. When black people were risking their lives in the 1960s to protest discrimination where they lived and worked, Lee enacted integration with the first mainstream black superhero. Black Panther, along with the X-Men and Luke Cage, are on-screen heroes today. But back then, they were the soldiers in Lee\u2019s battle against real-world foes of racism and xenophobia.\n\nAs fans celebrate Stan Lee's contributions to the pop culture canon, some have also revisited how Lee felt that with his comic books came great responsibility. (Nov. 14)\n\nUnder Lee\u2019s leadership, Marvel Comics introduced a generation of comic book readers to the African prince who rules a mythical and technologically advanced kingdom, the black ex-con whose brown skin repels bullets and the X-Men, and a group of heroes whose superpowers were as different as their cultural backgrounds.\n\nThe works and ideas of Lee and the artists behind T\u2019Challa, the Black Panther; Luke Cage, Hero for Hire; and Professor Xavier\u2019s band of merry mutants \u2014 groundbreaking during the 1960s and 1970s \u2014 have become a cultural force breaking down barriers to inclusion.\n\nLee had his fingers in all that Marvel produced, but some of the characters and plot lines \u201ccame from the artists being inspired by what was happening in the \u201960s,\u201d said freelance writer Alex Simmons.\n\nStill, there was some pushback by white comics distributors when it came to black heroes and characters. Some bundles of Marvel Comics were sent back because some distributors weren\u2019t prepared for the Black Panther and the kingdom of Wakanda developed by artist and co-creator Jack Kirby.\n\n\u201cStan had to take those risks,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cThere was a liberation movement, and I think Marvel became the voice of the people, tied into that rebellious energy and rode with it.\u201d\n\nLee also spoke to readers directly about the irrationality of hate. In 1968, a tumultuous year that saw the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Lee wrote one of his most vocal \u201cStan\u2019s Soapbox\u201d columns calling bigotry and racism \u201cthe deadliest social ills plaguing the world today.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, unlike a team of costumed super-villains, they can\u2019t be halted with a punch in the snoot, or a zap from a ray gun,\u201d Lee wrote.\n\nMarvel\u2019s characters always were at the forefront of how to deal with racial and other forms of discrimination, according to Mikhail Lyubansky, who teaches psychology of race and ethnicity at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. With the X-Men, many readers saw the mutants, ostracized for their powers, as a commentary on how Americans treated blacks and anyone seen as \u201cthe other.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe original X-Men were less about race and more about cultural differences,\u201d Lyubansky said. \u201cBlack Panther and some of the (Marvel) films took the mantle and ran with the racial issue in ways I think Stan didn\u2019t intend. But they were a great vehicle for it.\u201d\n\nSome of the efforts to break out minority characters haven\u2019t aged well. Marvel characters like the Fu Manchu-esque villain The Mandarin and the Native American athletic hero Wyatt Wingfoot were considered groundbreaking in the \u201960s and \u201970s, but may seem dated and too stereotypical when viewed through a 21st-century lens.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting. Stan Lee kind of takes the credit and the blame, depending on the character,\u201d said William Foster III, who helped establish the East Coast Black Age of Comics Convention and is an English professor at Naugatuck Valley Community College in Waterbury, Connecticut.\n\nFoster, who started reading Marvel Comics in the 1960s, said even doing something as minor as including people of color in the background was monumental.\n\n\u201cStan Lee had the attitude of \u2018We\u2019re in New York City. How can we possibly not have black people in New York City?\u2019\u201d Foster said.\n\nBlacks began taking on the roles of heroes and villains. Foster said some characters may have been seen as \u201ctokenism\u201d but that\u2019s sometimes where progress has to start.\n\nIn 10 years, the Marvel Cinematic Universe films have netted more than $17.6 billion in worldwide grosses. The \u201cBlack Panther\u201d movie pulled in more than $200 million in its debut weekend earlier this year. Next year, actress Brie Larson will take flight as \u201cCaptain Marvel.\u201d An animated movie centered on Miles Morales, a half-black and half-Puerto Rican teen who inherits the Spider-Man suit, will drop next month. And there continues to be interest around Kamala Khan a.k.a. Ms. Marvel, the first Muslim superhero.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of white friends growing up,\u201d said freelance writer Simmons, who is black. \u201cWe watched \u2018Batman\u2019 and we also watched \u2018The Mod Squad.\u2019 My personal belief is that if you put the material out in front of folks and they connect with it, they are going to connect with it.\u201d\n\nFor many fans and consumers, it\u2019s about the product not the skin color or sexual orientation of the character, he added.\n\nCrummell, the comic book artist, said she thinks representation for minorities and women in comic books is improving.\n\n\u201cI think now, they\u2019re seeing that everybody reads comics. It\u2019s not a specific group now,\u201d Crummell said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just African-American people \u2014 it\u2019s women, it\u2019s Asians, Hispanic characters now.

And she could only sense the site of the pavilion, the once-vibrant center of Jonestown life where so many died \u2014 including her two sisters and two nephews.\n\n\u201cWhen I left at 21, I left a part of myself there,\u201d she said. \u201cI was going back to retrieve that young person and also to say goodbye.\u201d\n\nTHE JONESES\u2019 FIRSTBORN\n\nThough he waved and smiled at Peoples Temple services, seemingly enraptured like the rest, Stephan Gandhi Jones says he always had his doubts.\n\n\u201cThis is really crazy,\u201d he recalls thinking.\n\nBut Stephan was the biological son of Jim and Marceline Jones. And the temple was his life \u2014 first in Indiana, later in California.\n\n\u201cSo much was attractive and unique that we turned a blind eye on what was wrong,\u201d he said, including his father\u2019s sexual excesses, drug abuse and rants.\n\nAs a San Francisco high school student, he was dispatched to help build Jonestown. It would become a little town where people of all ages and colors raised food and children.\n\nStephan helped erect a basketball court and form a team. In the days before Ryan\u2019s fact-finding mission to the settlement, the players were in Georgetown for a tourney with the Guyana national teams.\n\nRebelling, they refused Jones\u2019 order to come back. Stephan believed he was too cowardly to follow through with the oft-threatened \u201crevolutionary suicide.\u201d\n\nBut after temple gunmen killed the congressman, three newsmen and a church defector on the Port Kaituma airstrip, Jones ordered a poisoned grape-flavored drink administered to children first. That way no one else would want to live.\n\nStephan Jones and some other team members believe they might have changed history if they were there. \u201cThe reality was we were folks who could be counted on to stand up,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way we would be shooting at the airstrip. That\u2019s what triggered it.\u201d\n\nHe went through years of nightmares, mourning and shame. To cope, he says he abused drugs and exercised obsessively. \u201cI focused my rage on Dad and his circle, rather than deal with me,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than 300 Jonestown victims were children. Now, Stephan Jones is father of three daughters, ages 16, 25 and 29, and works in the office furniture installation business.\n\nHe says his daughters have seen him gnash his teeth when he talks about his father, but they also have heard him speak lovingly of the man who taught him compassion and other virtues.\n\n\u201cPeople ask, \u2018How can you ever be proud of your father?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI just have to love him and forgive him.\u201d\n\nNINTH-GRADER FROM FRESNO\n\nEugene Smith recalls how his mother, a churchgoing African-American, bought into Jim Jones\u2019 dream after they attended a service in Fresno. She gave her house to the Peoples Temple and they moved to San Francisco.\n\nHe was 18 and running a temple construction crew when the church sanctioned his marriage to a talented 16-year-old singer, Ollie Wideman. After Ollie became pregnant, she was sent to Jonestown; Eugene remained behind.\n\nWhen Smith reunited with his mother and wife in Jonestown, Ollie was 8\u00bd months pregnant.\n\nThe reunion with Jones was not as joyous. Jones berated three other new arrivals for misbehavior on the trip; they were beaten and forced to work 24 hours straight.\n\n\u201cHe made a promise \u2014 once we get to Jonestown there is no corporal punishment,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIn an hour, that promise was broken.\u201d\n\nLife became more tolerable after the couple\u2019s baby, Martin Luther Smith, was born. Ollie worked in the nursery, and Eugene felled trees. But he said his discontent festered.\n\nWhen he was ordered to Georgetown to help with supply shipments, Smith said he concocted an escape plan: Ollie and other temple singers and dancers, he believed, would soon be sent to Georgetown to perform, and the family would flee to the U.S. Embassy.\n\nBut the entertainers stayed in Jonestown to entertain Ryan. And Smith\u2019s wife, son and mother died.\n\n\u201cAll I could do is weep,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter more than 22 years at California\u2019s transportation department, Smith retired in 2015. He\u2019s 61 now. He\u2019s never remarried, and Martin Luther Smith was his only child.\n\nBORN INTO TEMPLE FAMILY\n\nWhen John Cobb was born in 1960 in a black section of Indianapolis, his mother and older siblings already were temple members. But in 1973, John\u2019s oldest brother and a sister, along with six other California college students, quit the church and became its enemies. When the prodigals visited, the Cobbs kept it secret from Jones.\n\nJohn was attending a San Francisco high school when he was allowed to join his best friends in Jonestown. There, as part of Jones\u2019 personal security detail, Cobb saw the once captivating minister strung out on drugs, afraid to venture anywhere for fear of his legal problems.\n\n\u201cIf anything, we felt pity for him,\u201d he said, \u201cand it grew into a dislike, maybe hate.\u201d\n\nHe too was a member of the basketball team. His biggest regrets revolve around the team\u2019s refusal to return to Jonestown. \u201cI believe 100 percent that not everyone would have been dead,\u201d he said.\n\nCobb lost 11 relatives that day, including his mother, youngest brother and four sisters.\n\nNow 58, he owns a modular office furniture business in the East Bay and is married with a daughter. 29. One day, when she was in high school, she came home and told her parents that her religion class had discussed Peoples Temple; only then did her father share the story of how his family was nearly wiped out.\n\nShe wept.\n\nJONESES\u2019 ADOPTED SON\n\nThe Joneses adopted a black baby in Indiana in 1960, and Jim gave the 10-week-old infant his own name. \u201cLittle Jimmy\u201d became part of their \u201cRainbow Family\u201d of white, black, Korean-American and Native American children.\n\nIn California, he was steeped in temple life. Those who broke rules were disciplined. At first it was spanking of children. Then it was boxing matches for adults.\n\n\u201cTo me, the ends justified the means,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were trying to build a new world, a progressive socialist organization.\u201d\n\nThe church provided free drug rehabilitation, medical care, food. It marched for four jailed Fresno newsmen. When Jim Sr., a local Democratic Party darling, met with future first lady Rosalynn Carter, Jim Jr. proudly went along.\n\nAfter the temple exodus to Guyana, he was given a public relations post in Georgetown \u2014 and was part of the basketball team.\n\nHe was summoned to the temple radio room. In code, his father told him everyone was going to die in \u201crevolutionary suicide.\u201d\n\n\u201cI argued with my Dad,\u201d he said. \u201cI said there must be another way.\u201d\n\nJim Jr. would lose 15 immediate relatives in Jonestown, including his pregnant wife, Yvette Muldrow.\n\nIn the aftermath, he built a new life. He remarried three decades ago, and he and his wife, Erin, raised three sons. He converted to Catholicism and registered Republican. He built a long career in health care, while weathering his own serious health problems.\n\nOf course, even if he wanted to forget Jonestown, his name was an ever-present reminder.\n\nHe has taken a lead role in a 40th Jonestown anniversary memorial to be held Sunday at Oakland\u2019s Evergreen Cemetery, where remains of unclaimed and unidentified victims are buried. Four granite slabs are etched with names of the 918 people who died in Guyana\u2014 including James Warren Jones, which deeply offends some whose relatives perished.\n\n\u201cLike everyone else, he died there,\u201d his son said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he didn\u2019t cause it, create it. He did.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTim Reiterman, AP environment team editor, covered Jonestown for the San Francisco Examiner and was wounded when temple members fired on Rep. Leo Ryan\u2019s party in 1978.

The study was done by the Urban Institute, not the Brookings Institution. Additionally, a researcher who was quoted in the story, Brett Theodos, works for the Urban Institute, not the Brookings Institution.\n\nA corrected version of the story is below:\n\nAmazon\u2019s NYC home in \u2018opportunity zone\u2019 for Trump tax break\n\nAmazon\u2019s new home in New York City is in an \u2018opportunity zone\u2019 offering developers a big tax break. But is it deserved?\n\nBy BERNARD CONDON and STEPHEN BRAUN\n\nAssociated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Much of the New York City neighborhood selected by Amazon for one of its new headquarters is in a federal \u201copportunity zone,\u201d a designation created by President Donald Trump\u2019s tax overhaul that offers developers potentially millions of dollars in capital gains tax breaks to invest in high-poverty, low-income areas.\n\nCritics question whether Long Island City, the fast-gentrifying Queens neighborhood across the East River from the skyscrapers of Manhattan, needs such breaks. Median household income around Amazon\u2019s planned campus is $130,000 a year, poverty is half the city average and new buildings were going up long before the tax overhaul.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do is look at the skyline from Manhattan. You can see billions of dollars of private investment there already,\u201d said Don Peebles, a real estate developer based in New York. \u201cLong Island City doesn\u2019t strike me as high on the list for needing extensive tax incentives to stimulate economic development.\u201d\n\nUnder the new tax law, officials in each state designated 8,700 such zones across the country. Nearly 35 million Americans live in such areas, communities that in most cases have high poverty and unemployment, or contain or are near pockets in desperate need of development.\n\nThe site of Amazon\u2019s other new headquarters in Crystal City, Virginia, is not in an opportunity zone, nor is the site of another major Amazon office in Nashville, Tennessee, that was also announced Tuesday.\n\nAmazon did not mention the Long Island City opportunity zone tax breaks Tuesday in any of its announcements about the new campus. Company spokesman Adam Sedo declined to provide details about whether Amazon plans to take advantage of them.\n\nBut investors were already pouncing.\n\nCraig Bernstein, founder of the investment fund OPZ Capital, said the capital gains break is good public policy because it helps push investors to put up the money for new housing, which may be in high demand once Amazon fills an expected 25,000 new jobs in the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cThis will help expedite the process of building up the surrounding area,\u201d Bernstein said.\n\nBernstein said his fund is looking at investing in two buildings near the Amazon site to develop into mixed retail-residential space. With Amazon moving in, he said, he sees another reason to take a risk: a \u201ccaptive audience\u201d of workers looking for apartments and shops.\n\nSeparately, Amazon is tapping New York state and the city for grants and tax breaks worth about $2.8 billion.\n\nInvestors who plow capital gains into Opportunity Zone projects can defer taxes on those gains up to 2026. If they decide not to cash out on their investment for up to seven years, they receive another benefit. They get to exclude up to 15 percent of those gains from taxes. And they can completely exclude paying taxes on any further appreciation of those gains if they hold onto the investment for a decade. Capital gains taxes can be as high as 23.8 percent.\n\nThe $2.5 billion that Amazon said it will spend building its Long Island City campus could save Amazon potentially hundreds of millions on its federal tax bill.\n\nFund manager Bernstein said that he is not familiar with Amazon\u2019s tax situation, but that any company that is allowed to delay paying tax is getting the equivalent of an interest-free loan from the government. That benefit alone on $2.5 billion in gains is worth about $150 million in interest saved through 2026, assuming a conservative borrowing rate of 3.5 percent. Add in the portion of gains the company is excused from paying any tax on, and that would bump the savings to at least $225 million.\n\nCritics worry that such sweetheart tax savings would benefit real estate interests aiming to invest in areas that are already on the rise, or are bolstered by their proximity to expanding institutions such as hospitals or colleges.\n\nAn Urban Institute study of the administration\u2019s list of more than 8,700 opportunity zones found that nearly a third were already gentrifying, based on such factors as rent increases and the percentage of college-educated residents.\n\nThe Treasury Department, which approved the state choices of the opportunity zones, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe study\u2019s data on Amazon\u2019s Long Island City site shows the tract is already heavily gentrified and awash in investment. And figures from New York City\u2019s planning department list the neighborhood as the fastest-growing in the city, with more than 9,000 apartments and homes built since 2010.\n\nIn the past year, two-bedroom apartments off the Anable Basin where Amazon would move have rented for an average $4,300 a month, according to brokerage site Streeteasy. That puts it on par with rent in some buildings on the Upper East Side across the East River in Manhattan.\n\n\u201cThat kind of opportunity zone already has lots of opportunity,\u201d said Brett Theodos, a research associate with the Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center at the Urban Institute.\n\nThe census tract where Amazon is moving has a poverty rate of 10 percent, half that for all of New York City, and the household income of $130,000 a year is double the city median.\n\nThat makes the area too wealthy to qualify for tax breaks on its own, but the tax law allows such areas to piggyback on nearby ones that do qualify.\n\nFor example, Amazon\u2019s Anable Basin site is just a mile from the census tract containing Queensbridge Houses, the nation\u2019s largest public housing complex, where the median household income is $14,000 and the poverty rate is nearly 50 percent.\n\n___\n\nStephen Braun reported from Washington.", "A search and rescue worker, looking for Camp Fire victims, carries Susie Q. to safety after the cadaver dog fell through rubble at the Holly Hills Mobile Estates on Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018, in Paradise, Calif.

There were also three fatalities from separate blazes in Southern California.\n\n(Nov. 14)\n\nHonea said the task of searching for bodies was so vast that his office brought in another 287 searchers Wednesday, including the National Guard troops, bringing the total number of searchers to 461 plus 22 cadaver dogs. He said a rapid-DNA assessment system was expected to be in place soon to speed up identifications of the dead, though officials have tentatively identified 47 of the 56.\n\nIt will take years to rebuild the town of 27,000, if people decide that\u2019s what should be done, said Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The town in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains looks like a wasteland.\n\n\u201cThe infrastructure is basically a total rebuild at this point,\u201d Long said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to rebuild Paradise the way it was.\u201d\n\nTemporary schools and hospitals will be brought in, Long said. Officials are also looking to bring in mobile homes for thousands of people left homeless.\n\nDebris removal in Paradise and outlying communities will have to wait until the search for victims finishes, he said.\n\nThat grim search continued Wednesday.\n\nOn one street, ash and dust flew up as roughly 20 National Guard members wearing white jumpsuits, helmets and breathing masks lifted giant heaps of bent and burned metal, in what was left of a home. Pink and blue chalk drawings of a cat and a flower remained on the driveway, near a scorched toy truck.\n\nThe soldiers targeted homes of the missing. If anything resembling human remains is found, a coroner takes over.\n\nAfter the soldiers finished at the site, a chaplain huddled with them in prayer.\n\nThe number of missing is \u201cfluctuating every day\u201d as people are located or remains are found, said Steve Collins, a deputy with the Butte County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\nAuthorities on Wednesday released the names of about 100 people who are still missing, including many in their 80s and 90s, and dozens more could still be unaccounted for. Sheriff\u2019s department spokeswoman Megan McMann said the list was incomplete because detectives were concerned they would be overwhelmed with calls from relatives if the entire list were released.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t release them all at once,\u201d McMann said. \u201cSo they are releasing the names in batches.\u201d\n\nAuthorities have not updated the total number of missing since Sunday, when 228 people were unaccounted for.\n\nSol Bechtold\u2019s 75-year-old mother was not on the list. Her house burned down along with the rest of her neighborhood in Magalia, a community just north of Paradise.\n\n\u201cThe list they published is missing a lot of names,\u201d said Bechtold, who\u2019s still searching shelters for his mother, a widow who lived alone and did not drive.\n\nA sheriff\u2019s deputy asked Bechtold on Wednesday for information that could identify her remains, like any history of broken bones. He told the officer she had a knee replacement. Bechtold predicted that the death toll would rise sharply.\n\n\u201cI feel horrible for the sheriff. I feel horrible for the people of Paradise and Magalia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a no-win situation unless a few hundred folks just show up out of nowhere.\u201d\n\nTo speed up identification of remains, officials are using portable devices that can identify genetic material in a couple of hours, rather than days or weeks.\n\nAccounts of narrow escapes from the flames continued to emerge. More than a dozen people who were trapped by a wall of fire survived by plunging into a cold lake.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday that a family of four, their 90-year-old neighbor and their pets sought safety in the chilly Concow Reservoir after the roaring fire surrounded their homes.\n\nThe family stood in shoulder-deep water as flames singed the vegetation on the shore behind them.

No friends or relatives of Ramos or his victims witnessed the execution.\n\nMexican officials had called for his execution to be stopped, arguing he was part of a group of Mexican citizens condemned in the U.S. who were never told when first arrested that they could get legal help from the Mexican government.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday night cleared the way for the punishment when it denied two appeals seeking to halt the lethal injection. Ramos\u2019 attorney on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to stop his execution, arguing that Ramos\u2019 constitutional rights were violated as lower courts refused to fully review his claims that his trial lawyers failed to present any evidence about his mental illness and abusive childhood that could have persuaded jurors to spare his life.\n\nThree retired justices who had served on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals filed court documents with the Supreme Court on Wednesday in support of stopping the execution. The ex-judges alleged the appeals court appointed an incompetent appellate attorney who early in the post-conviction process failed to investigate Ramos\u2019 case.\n\nAlso Wednesday, a federal judge in Austin dismissed Ramos\u2019 request to temporarily block the execution. The request had been part of a lawsuit Ramos filed against the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals a day earlier. The suit alleged the appeals court had not allowed Ramos to present claims he had ineffective trial and appellate lawyers.\n\nThe 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had previously turned down requests to halt Ramos\u2019 execution.\n\nThe Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Monday declined to recommend either a commutation of his sentence or a six-month reprieve.\n\nIn court documents, Ramos\u2019 appellate attorney, Danalynn Recer, had argued Ramos suffered from bipolar disorder most of his life, including during the time of his family\u2019s killings, as well as brain damage that affected his ability to control his impulses and regulate his emotions.\n\nRecer said Ramos was also brutally beaten as a child by his father.\n\nRamos was born in Aguascalientes, Mexico, and grew up in Guadalajara and Tijuana before his family moved to the United States in 1970.\n\n\u201cNo fact-finder or decision-maker entrusted with Mr. Moreno Ramos\u2019 life has ever been provided with evidence of (his) \u2018diverse human frailties\u2019 to assist them in dispensing the most severe punishment under law,\u201d Recer said.\n\nBut the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office said Ramos\u2019 death sentence was appropriate due to his \u201cviolent and dangerous nature.\u201d\n\nAuthorities said Ramos bludgeoned his family members and then buried them underneath his home\u2019s bathroom floor so he could marry the woman he was having an extramarital affair with at the time.\n\nIn court filings, the attorney general\u2019s office highlighted testimony from Ramos\u2019 then-19-year-old son, who told jurors at Ramos\u2019 1993 trial that his father \u201cwould continue to commit criminal acts of violence.\u201d\n\nIn 2004, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, found Ramos was part of a group of 52 Mexican citizens awaiting execution in the U.S. who weren\u2019t advised of their consular rights under the Vienna Convention when first arrested. It recommended they be tried again to determine if consular access would have affected their cases. Then-President George W. Bush directed states to reopen the cases.\n\nBut the Supreme Court in 2008 overruled Bush\u2019s directive, saying only Congress can require states to follow the international court\u2019s ruling.\n\nIncluding Ramos, six Mexican citizens have been executed since being named in the international court ruling and all the executions were carried out by Texas, according to the Mexican government.\n\n___\n\nLozano reported from Houston.\n\n___\n\nFollow Juan A.

(Robert Scheer/The Indianapolis Star via AP, File)\n\nNOBLESVILLE, Ind. (AP) \u2014 A 13-year-old boy has shown no remorse for shooting his teacher and a classmate at his Indianapolis-area school, and he should be held at a state juvenile detention center until he is 18 or deemed rehabilitated, an Indiana judge ruled Wednesday.\n\nHamilton County Circuit Court Judge Paul Felix rejected a request from the boy\u2019s attorneys that he be sent to a private treatment facility after he admitted shooting seventh-grade science teacher Jason Seaman and 13-year-old Ella Whistler during the May 25 attack at Noblesville West Middle School.\n\nThe boy apologized for the attack during a hearing last week. His admission in juvenile court is similar to a guilty plea in adult court.\n\n\u201cI did not think it was sincere,\u201d Felix said during the teen\u2019s punishment hearing Wednesday. \u201cNo remorse was shown last week.\u201d\n\nThe boy, who was led into the courtroom in an orange-and-white striped jumpsuit, showed little reaction as he sat between his parents and his attorneys, answering the judge\u2019s questions with, \u201cYes, your honor.\u201d But after Felix announced his ruling, the boy appeared slightly dazed, his eyes blinking, and nodded when his mother spoke to him.\n\nThe Associated Press isn\u2019t using the boy\u2019s name because he is charged as a juvenile.\n\nThe judge told him that evidence shows he planned the attack on his own and had meant for it to be deadly.\n\n\u201cYou went into the school intending to kill not just two people but many people,\u201d Felix told the boy. \u201cYou wanted devastation, an inescapable tragedy for the ages.\u201d\n\nFelix ordered that the boy be sent to the Indiana Department of Correction for placement in a state juvenile detention facility for rehabilitation until he is 18, followed by probation.\n\nThe judge\u2019s order, however, is \u201cindeterminate,\u201d meaning that the DOC\u2019s juvenile division could release him before he turns 18 if the department determines that he\u2019s been rehabilitated through treatment in state custody, said Andre Miksha, chief deputy prosecutor for Hamilton County.\n\nUpon his release, whether at age 18 or earlier, the juvenile court will determine the length and terms of the teenager\u2019s probation and will he remain under the court\u2019s supervision until he turns 21, unless the court discharges him from its jurisdiction earlier, Miksha said.\n\nDefense lawyer Christopher Eskew said he hopes his client receives the counseling he needs in the state juvenile system, but that he\u2019s concerned about Correction\u2019s resources. Most of the department\u2019s treatment programs are for alcohol, drugs or sexual abuse.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little actual emotional treatment there,\u201d Eskew said after Wednesday\u2019s hearing.\n\nEskew argued that he needs therapy at a private treatment facility, not exposure to older teenagers at a maximum security juvenile detention facility.\n\nBut Felix said older teens were unlikely to be an influence on the youth, who has been held at a juvenile detention center since the shooting. The judge noted that Legos were taken away from the boy in October after he used them to form the shape of a rifle.\n\n\u201cMy fear is for the safety of those you will be near, not the other way around,\u201d he said.\n\nProsecutors said during last week\u2019s hearing that the boy took two handguns and more than 100 rounds of ammunition from a safe in the basement of his family\u2019s home, and took them to school in a backpack.\n\nProsecutors said the boy \u201cis obsessed with violence\u201d and that the day before the shooting he made a video that was found on his phone and other devices in which he displayed the handguns and said: \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Friday, you know what that means. I have to take other people\u2019s lives before I take my own.\u201d\n\nWhistler survived, despite being shot seven times. The teacher, Seaman, was shot three times. He testified last week that the boy returned to his classroom from a bathroom break and opened fire.\n\nSeaman, a former football player at Southern Illinois University, said he threw a miniature basketball at the boy as he fired shots, and then tackled the youth and disarmed him.\n\nInvestigators testified that the boy\u2019s online history was filled with searches for school shootings, including \u201cWhat was the largest mass shooting in America\u201d the day before the shooting.

The banner reads\" We welcome the leader who brought life to people\" in Sinhalese. (AP Photo/Eranga Jayawardena)\n\nCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s Parliament passed a no-confidence vote against the government headed by the hastily sworn-in and bitterly disputed Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, as lawmakers convened Wednesday for the first time since the president dismissed his Cabinet and suspended the legislature last month.\n\nThe motion brought by the head of an opposition party could mean that Rajapaksa will have to resign his post but does not necessarily mean the leader whose ousting set off the crisis will be reinstated, creating a power vacuum in the South Asian island nation.\n\n\u201cRajapaksa\u2019s government will fall,\u201d said Paikiasothy Sarvanamuttu, executive director of the Colombo-based nonpartisan Centre for Policy Alternatives civil society group, and among the petitioners who challenged the constitutionality of President Maithripala Sirisena\u2019s recent actions.\n\nSarvanamuttu said the no-confidence vote leaves Sirisena with two options \u2014 either to reinstate Ranil Wickremesinghe, whom he replaced with Rajapaksa on Oct. 26, as prime minister, or await the decision of the Supreme Court, which is due to issue a ruling on the ouster and subsequent government appointments on Dec. 7.\n\nLawmakers supporting Wickremesinghe had a visible majority in the chamber on Wednesday, with many wearing shawls emblazoned with the words \u201cFor democracy.\u201d\n\nAs Speaker of Parliament Karu Jayasuriya prepared to let the no-confidence motion be debated, the chamber descended into chaos, with lawmakers supporting Rajapaksa filing into the center of the room shouting political slogans and accusing Jayasuriya of betraying the people\u2019s mandate.\n\nJayasuriya then said he had no choice but to bypass the debate and take an oral vote, with those in favor clearly voicing more support for the motion than those against it.\n\nBefore the results were announced, Rajapaksa walked out of the chamber.\n\nAfter it became clear last week that Rajapaksa would not survive a no-confidence motion, Sirisena dissolved Parliament, but the Supreme Court on Tuesday had ordered the legislature to keep working until next month.\n\nNamal Rajapaksa, a lawmaker in his father\u2019s United People Freedom Alliance party, told The Associated Press that they \u201cdon\u2019t accept this verdict\u201d and will continue as the government.\n\nRajapaksa supporters outside Parliament shouted: \u201cWe need a government!\u201d\n\nParliament adjourned after the vote and is to reconvene Thursday morning.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s Supreme Court on Tuesday suspended Sirisena\u2019s order to dissolve Parliament and hold new elections.\n\nWickremesinghe, who has been holed up at the prime minister\u2019s official residence in Colombo since his ouster, said at a news conference after the vote that he and his supporters \u201chave proved that there is a purported administration which does not enjoy the support of Parliament. And therefore it\u2019s illegal.\u201d\n\nHe said that police and civil servants should cease carrying out orders from the Rajapaksa-led government.\n\nLate Tuesday, Sirisena held a meeting of the Security Council, including the military commander, police chief and defense secretary.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 With time running out in Florida\u2019s high-stakes election recount, lawsuits piled up Wednesday amid a maelstrom of courtroom arguments, outdated ballot-scanning machines overheated and President Donald Trump leveled his latest unfounded allegation, that people had been voting in disguise.\n\nMany counties have wrapped up their machine recount ahead of a Thursday deadline to complete reviews of the U.S. Senate and governor races, but larger Democratic strongholds were still racing to meet the deadline.\n\nNo less than six federal lawsuits have been filed so far in Tallahassee. In a key court battle, a federal judge said he was unlikely to order election officials to automatically count thousands of mail-in ballots that were rejected because the signatures on the ballots did not match signatures on file. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker, however, did say he was open to giving voters extra time to fix their ballots.\n\nState officials said the matching requirement had led to the voiding of nearly 4,000 ballots, although that figure did not include larger counties such as Miami-Dade.\n\nWalker rebuffed arguments from lawyers representing the state that allowing people until Saturday evening to fix their ballots would disrupt the recount process and the deadlines to report results. The deadline for hand recounts is Sunday.\n\nDespite an ongoing recount in Florida for the extremely tight Senate race between Gov. Rick Scott and Sen. Bill Nelson, Scott appeared at a photo opp Wednesday on Capitol Hill for newly-elected Republican Senators. (Nov. 14)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s going to completely bring Florida to its knees,\u201d Walker said.\n\nHe said that, divided among 67 counties, the number of ballots would be only a handful per county, and they\u2019d be considered while the elections supervisors are still counting overseas ballots.\n\n\u201cWhat are the possibilities that all 5,000 are going to show up?\u201d Walker said if people are given an opportunity to correct their signatures. \u201cI can tell you the odds: Zero.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump also added to the grumblings about the recount by arguing without evidence that some people unlawfully participated in the election by dressing in disguise.\n\n\u201cWhen people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles,\u201d Trump said in an interview with The Daily Caller published Wednesday. \u201cSometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again.\u201d\n\nThe state elections department and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, both run by Republican appointees, have said they haven\u2019t seen any evidence of voter fraud of this sort.\n\nBut it was disclosed that a top attorney at the Florida Department of State sent a letter last week asking federal prosecutors to investigate whether Democrats distributed false information that could have resulted in voters having mail-in ballots disqualified.\n\nFour county supervisors turned over information that showed Democratic Party operatives changed official forms to say that voters had until two days after the election to fix any problems with mail-in ballot signatures. Under current law, a voter has until the day before Election Day to fix a problem.\n\nIn other developments, Republican Gov. Rick Scott agreed to step down from the state panel responsible for certifying the final results. Scott is locked in a tight race with U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson and has already suggested fraud may be taking place in some counties. Critics have said Scott should have no role in overseeing the election given his close contest.\n\nMeanwhile, problems continued in Palm Beach County, where tallying machines overheated while working overtime. That caused mismatched results with the recount of 174,000 early voting ballots, forcing workers to go back and redo their work.\n\n\u201cThe machines are old,\u201d said Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher, who said they underwent maintenance right before the election. \u201cI don\u2019t think they were designed to work 24/7 \u2014 kind of like running an old car from here to L.A. And so, you know, things happen to them.\u201d\n\nRight now, Palm Beach County looks like it could miss the Thursday deadline, even though Nelson and Democrats filed lawsuits seeking to suspend it.\n\nAlso among the half-dozen federal lawsuits filed in Florida\u2019s capital, Nelson\u2019s campaign also is suing to seek public records from a north Florida elections supervisor who allowed voters in GOP-heavy Bay County to email their ballots in apparent violation of state law.\n\nWalker, citing a well-known \u201cStar Trek\u201d episode about rapidly-reproducing furry aliens, said during one election lawsuit hearing Wednesday that \u201cI feel a little bit like Captain Kirk in the episode with the Tribbles where they start to multiply.\u201d He began his third hearing of the day by correcting himself: \u201cThe lawyers are multiplying like Tribbles \u2014 not the lawsuits.\u201d\n\nThe developments are fueling frustrations among Democrats and Republicans as the recount unfolds more than a week after Election Day. Democrats have urged state officials to do whatever it takes to make sure every vote is counted. Republicans, including Trump, have argued without evidence that voter fraud threatens to steal races from the GOP.\n\nThe Republican candidates for governor and Senate, Ron DeSantis and Scott, hold the narrowest of leads over their Democratic counterparts, Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson.\n\nScott was in Washington, D.C., while the court battles rage on. He stood at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s left shoulder Wednesday when the Kentucky Republican welcomed GOP senators who will take their seats in January when the new Congress is sworn in.\n\nDuring the brief photo-op in McConnell\u2019s Capitol office, Scott did not reply to a question about whether he contends there was fraud in the election.\n\nState law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. In the Senate race, Scott\u2019s lead over Nelson was 0.14 percentage points. In the governor\u2019s contest, unofficial results showed DeSantis ahead of Gillum by 0.41 percentage points.\n\nOnce the machine recount is complete, a hand recount will be ordered in any race where the difference is 0.25 percentage points or less, meaning it could take even longer to complete the review of the Senate race if the difference remains narrow.\n\nIf the Senate race does go to a hand recount, the deadline for counties to finish is Sunday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jennifer Kay and Freida Frisaro in Miami and Alan Fram, Darlene Superville and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida\u2019s election started badly when Hurricane Michael disrupted early voting in some Panhandle counties. Long lines, ballot shortages and other problems followed statewide, both during early voting and on Election Day. Now the state is having recounts in its U.S. Senate and governor races.\n\nBecause of the 2000 presidential recount fiasco and Florida being the largest swing state, any election problems it incurs immediately become a national crisis \u2014 one that President Donald Trump and Republican Gov. Rick Scott inflamed by accusing elections supervisors in two major Democratic counties of fraud without offering evidence. State law enforcement and elections officials have said no fraud complaints have been filed.\n\nIn the Senate race, Scott\u2019s lead over incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson is 0.14 percentage point \u2014 about one vote for every 700 cast. In the governor\u2019s contest, unofficial results show Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage point.\n\nSo how does the recount work? What problems have been reported? Is Florida really that screwed up? And do Nelson and Gillum have a shot?\n\nDespite an ongoing recount in Florida for the extremely tight Senate race between Gov. Rick Scott and Sen. Bill Nelson, Scott appeared at a photo opp Wednesday on Capitol Hill for newly-elected Republican Senators. (Nov. 14)\n\nHOW THE RECOUNT WORKS\n\nFor now, it\u2019s simple. Florida\u2019s 67 county elections offices run the ballots through the tallying machines a second time. Not all counties are created equal, however \u2014 small counties have only a few thousand votes, while Miami-Dade has 800,000. Overall, 8 million votes were cast. The counties\u2019 deadline is Thursday afternoon, pending court action seeking to extend it. Some are already done, including Miami-Dade.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets tricky. If the statewide margin between the candidates after the machine recount is less than 0.25 percentage point \u2014 one vote for every 400 cast \u2014 the counties conduct a manual recount. During the initial recount, the machines set aside any ballots that cannot be tallied. During a manual recount, only those ballots are re-examined to see whether the voter skipped the race or marked the ballot in a way that cannot be machine read but can be deciphered.\n\nFor example, in most counties voters fill a bubble for their candidate. But some mark the bubble with an X or circle the name. Others cross out one bubble and fill another. If the voter\u2019s intention is clear, that ballot is counted. If not, it isn\u2019t.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT?\n\nThe results will be presented to the state\u2019s canvassing board, for final approval \u2014 that\u2019s scheduled for next week, pending court action. Scott would normally sit on the panel, but he recused himself Wednesday. Typically, the board\u2019s approval is perfunctory. The state did not respond to a query asking what happens if the board refuses to certify the results.\n\nELECTION PROBLEMS\n\nSeveral problems, real and perceived, have cropped up in the counting and casting of ballots \u2014 some worse than others.\n\nDemocratic-dominated Broward and Palm Beach, the state\u2019s second- and third-most populous counties, were both slow to complete their counts. That\u2019s why Nelson and Gillum gained ground in the days after the election. That led to accusations by Trump, Scott and others that something nefarious was afoot \u2014 but they offered no evidence and a slow count is not illegal.\n\nWhile Florida\u2019s other 65 counties all tallied at least 99 percent of their votes by noon the day after the election, by that time Broward stood at 94 percent and Palm Beach at 96, an Associated Press analysis showed. Broward blamed its lengthy ballot, which included 10 county charter amendments, while Palm Beach blamed aging voting equipment. However, a quick count is not required: State law says the initial tally must be finished four days after the election and Broward and Palm Beach met the deadline.\n\n\u201cIf it didn\u2019t take up to four days, the law wouldn\u2019t have put that in there,\u201d said Eugene Pettis, attorney for Brenda Snipes , the county\u2019s elections supervisor.\n\nBroward also accidentally counted 22 provisional ballots that had been deemed ineligible, mostly because the signatures on the envelopes didn\u2019t match those on file. Snipes acknowledged the error.\n\nPalm Beach Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher said her county might not make Thursday\u2019s original deadline because its tabulation machines may not be fast enough. If a county\u2019s recount in a race is incomplete, its pre-recount tally stands.\n\nBut Broward and Palm Beach weren\u2019t the only counties with possible or actual irregularities.\n\nFor example, in Republican-dominated Bay County, Elections Supervisor Mark Andersen accepted 147 ballots by email, even though that\u2019s barred by state law. Andersen said the voters were displaced by Hurricane Michael, telling a Panhandle television station that anyone who objects \u201cought to be ashamed.\u201d\n\nIS FLORIDA REALLY MORE SCREWED UP THAN OTHER STATES?\n\nThat\u2019s subjective, but Florida\u2019s mistakes are magnified because the electorate is equally split. Voting problems in overwhelmingly Democratic states like California and New York or in Republican states like Texas and Utah do not get any attention because they don\u2019t change statewide outcomes.\n\nBallots got wet and couldn\u2019t be read last week in New York City. In Utah, some counties didn\u2019t have enough machines, causing hourslong lines. Google any state and \u201cvoting problem\u201d and chances are you will find something.\n\nCAN NELSON OR GILLUM STILL WIN?\n\nUnlikely, though Nelson\u2019s odds are better than Gillum\u2019s. Recounts that flip races are rare and candidates who have succeeded overcame much smaller deficits.\n\nIn the 2008 Minnesota Senate recount, Democrat Al Franken overcame an initial 206-vote gap to win by 312 votes. In the 2004 Washington governor\u2019s race, Democrat Christine Gregoire trailed by 261 votes in the initial count, but won by 133 after the recount.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Stephen Ohlemacher in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.\n\n____\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics .", "YORK, Maine (AP) \u2014 A southern Maine organization will receive more than $1.3 million from the federal government to beef up its support for low-income families.\n\nRepublican Sen.

It\u2019s a different technology than today\u2019s controversial \u201cgenetically modified\u201d foods, more like faster breeding that promises to boost nutrition, spur crop growth, and make farm animals hardier and fruits and vegetables last longer.\n\nThe U.S. National Academy of Sciences has declared gene editing one of the breakthroughs needed to improve food production so the world can feed billions more people amid a changing climate. Yet governments are wrestling with how to regulate this powerful new tool. And after years of confusion and rancor, will shoppers accept gene-edited foods or view them as GMOs in disguise?\n\n\u201cIf the consumer sees the benefit, I think they\u2019ll embrace the products and worry less about the technology,\u201d said Dan Voytas, a University of Minnesota professor and chief science officer for Calyxt Inc., which edited soybeans to make the oil heart-healthy.\n\n(AP Video/Federica Narancio)\n\nResearchers are pursuing more ambitious changes: Wheat with triple the usual fiber, or that\u2019s low in gluten. Mushrooms that don\u2019t brown, and better-producing tomatoes. Drought-tolerant corn, and rice that no longer absorbs soil pollution as it grows. Dairy cows that don\u2019t need to undergo painful de-horning, and pigs immune to a dangerous virus that can sweep through herds.\n\nScientists even hope gene editing eventually could save species from being wiped out by devastating diseases like citrus greening, a so far unstoppable infection that\u2019s destroying Florida\u2019s famed oranges.\n\nFirst they must find genes that could make a new generation of trees immune.\n\n\u201cIf we can go in and edit the gene, change the DNA sequence ever so slightly by one or two letters, potentially we\u2019d have a way to defeat this disease,\u201d said Fred Gmitter, a geneticist at the University of Florida Citrus Research and Education Center, as he examined diseased trees in a grove near Fort Meade.\n\nGENETICALLY MODIFIED OR EDITED, WHAT\u2019S THE DIFFERENCE?\n\nFarmers have long genetically manipulated crops and animals by selectively breeding to get offspring with certain traits. It\u2019s time-consuming and can bring trade-offs. Modern tomatoes, for example, are larger than their pea-sized wild ancestor, but the generations of cross-breeding made them more fragile and altered their nutrients.\n\nGMOs, or genetically modified organisms, are plants or animals that were mixed with another species\u2019 DNA to introduce a specific trait \u2014 meaning they\u2019re \u201ctransgenic.\u201d Best known are corn and soybeans mixed with bacterial genes for built-in resistance to pests or weed killers.\n\nDespite international scientific consensus that GMOs are safe to eat, some people remain wary and there is concern they could spur herbicide-resistant weeds.\n\nNow gene-editing tools, with names like CRISPR and TALENs, promise to alter foods more precisely, and at less cost, without necessarily adding foreign DNA. Instead, they act like molecular scissors to alter the letters of an organism\u2019s own genetic alphabet.\n\nThe technology can insert new DNA, but most products in development so far switch off a gene, according to University of Missouri professor Nicholas Kalaitzandonakes.\n\nThose new Calyxt soybeans? Voytas\u2019 team inactivated two genes so the beans produce oil with no heart-damaging trans fat and that shares the famed health profile of olive oil without its distinct taste.\n\nThe hornless calves? Most dairy Holsteins grow horns that are removed for the safety of farmers and other cows. Recombinetics Inc. swapped part of the gene that makes dairy cows grow horns with the DNA instructions from naturally hornless Angus beef cattle.\n\n\u201cPrecision breeding,\u201d is how animal geneticist Alison Van Eenennaam of the University of California, Davis, explains it. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to replace traditional breeding,\u201d but make it easier to add one more trait.\n\nRULES AREN\u2019T CLEAR\n\nThe Agriculture Department says extra rules aren\u2019t needed for \u201cplants that could otherwise have been developed through traditional breeding,\u201d clearing the way for development of about two dozen gene-edited crops so far.\n\nIn contrast, the Food and Drug Administration in 2017 proposed tighter, drug-like restrictions on gene-edited animals. It promises guidance sometime next year on exactly how it will proceed.\n\nBecause of trade, international regulations are \u201cthe most important factor in whether genome editing technologies are commercialized,\u201d USDA\u2019s Paul Spencer told a meeting of agriculture economists.\n\nEurope\u2019s highest court ruled last summer that existing European curbs on the sale of transgenic GMOs should apply to gene-edited foods, too.\n\nBut at the World Trade Organization this month, the U.S. joined 12 nations including Australia, Canada, Argentina and Brazil in urging other countries to adopt internationally consistent, science-based rules for gene-edited agriculture.\n\nARE THESE FOODS SAFE?\n\nThe biggest concern is what are called off-target edits, unintended changes to DNA that could affect a crop\u2019s nutritional value or an animal\u2019s health, said Jennifer Kuzma of the Genetic Engineering and Society Center at North Carolina State University.\n\nScientists are looking for any signs of problems. Take the hornless calves munching in a UC-Davis field. One is female and once it begins producing milk, Van Eenennaam will test how similar that milk\u2019s fat and protein composition is to milk from unaltered cows.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of being overly cautious,\u201d she said, noting that if eating beef from naturally hornless Angus cattle is fine, milk from edited Holsteins should be, too.\n\nBut to Kuzma, companies will have to be up-front about how these new foods were made and the evidence that they\u2019re healthy. She wants regulators to decide case-by-case which changes are no big deal, and which might need more scrutiny.\n\n\u201cMost gene-edited plants and animals are probably going to be just fine to eat. But you\u2019re only going to do yourself a disservice in the long run if you hide behind the terminology,\u201d Kuzma said.\n\nAVOIDING A BACKLASH\n\nUncertainty about regulatory and consumer reaction is creating some strange bedfellows. An industry-backed group of food makers and farmers asked university researchers and consumer advocates to help craft guidelines for \u201cresponsible use\u201d of gene editing in the food supply.\n\n\u201cClearly this coalition is in existence because of some of the battle scars from the GMO debates, there\u2019s no question about that,\u201d said Greg Jaffe of the food-safety watchdog Center for Science in the Public Interest, who agreed to join the Center for Food Integrity\u2019s guidelines group. \u201cThere\u2019s clearly going to be questions raised about this technology.\u201d\n\nSUSTAINABILITY OR HYPE?\n\nGene-editing can\u2019t do everything, cautioned Calyxt\u2019s Voytas. There are limitations to how much foods could be changed. Sure, scientists made wheat containing less gluten, but it\u2019s unlikely to ever be totally gluten-free for people who can\u2019t digest that protein, for example \u2014 or to make, say, allergy-free peanuts.\n\nNor is it clear how easily companies will be able to edit different kinds of food, key to their profit.\n\nDespite her concerns about adequate regulation, Kuzma expects about 20 gene-edited crops to hit the U.S. market over five years \u2014 and she notes that scientists also are exploring changes to crops, like cassava, that are important in the poorest countries.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s going to really revolutionize the industry,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Jim Jordan, the co-founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, McCarthy will be tested by Republicans on and off Capitol Hill who remain angry and divided after their midterm losses and split over how best to move forward.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be back,\u201d McCarthy promised, claiming a unified front for the Republican leadership team. He won by 159-43 among House Republicans.\n\nMcCarthy, who has been majority leader under Ryan, acknowledged Republicans \u201ctook a beating\u201d in the suburbs in last week\u2019s national elections, especially as the ranks of GOP female lawmakers plummeted from 23 to 13. The GOP side of the aisle will be made up of 90 percent white men in the new Congress \u2014 an imbalance he blamed on billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s election spending to help Democrats.\n\nRepublican Kevin McCarthy easily won an internal party election to take over the shrunken House GOP caucus. His top priority will be to protect President Donald Trump's agenda and try to build the party back to retake the majority. (Nov. 14)\n\nBloomberg spent more than $110 million in the midterms. Two Republican women were defeated by candidates he supported, and both were replaced by Democratic women, said spokeswoman Rachel Nagler.\n\nMcCarthy has been here before, having helped pick up the party after Republicans last lost control of the House in 2006, leading them to the 2010 tea party wave that pushed them back into the majority.\n\nTrump, who is close to McCarthy but also friendly with Jordan, largely stayed on the sidelines in the intraparty House contest. The outcome gives the president two allies positioned to help him.\n\nWhile McCarthy provides an affable face for the GOP, Jordan, the former Ohio wrestling champ and a Fox News regular, will be fighting Democrats\u2019 investigations into Trump\u2019s businesses and administration.\n\nGOP Whip Steve Scalise, the Louisiana Republican who was badly wounded in last year\u2019s congressional baseball practice shooting and unanimously won his position Wednesday, said McCarthy \u201cknows what he needs to do.\u201d\n\nRounding out the GOP leadership team will be Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who was on hand to watch his daughter take over the No. 3 spot he held decades ago. \u201cHe told me not to screw it up,\u201d she said.\n\nHouse Democrats put off until after Thanksgiving their more prominent contest, Rep. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s bid to regain the speaker\u2019s gavel she held when the Democrats last had the majority.\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky won another term leading Republicans and Chuck Schumer of New York won for Democrats. Both were selected by acclamation.\n\nSenate Republicans also welcomed the first woman to their leadership team in years, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, as they sought to address the optics of the GOP side of the aisle being dominated by men. Ernst called her selection \u201ca great honor.\u201d\n\nIn the House, Jordan and McCarthy shook hands after a testy two days of closed-door sessions, according to lawmakers in the room for Wednesday\u2019s voting. Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the Freedom Caucus chairman, called it a \u201cgentlemanly\u201d debate.\n\nBut the friendly talk papers over the infighting between the GOP\u2019s conservative and moderate flanks as lawmakers dole out blame after the midterm election losses that handed House Democrats the majority.\n\nMany Republicans side with Jordan\u2019s theory, which is that Republicans, despite a GOP monopoly on power in Washington, lost because they didn\u2019t \u201cdo what we said\u201d \u2014 including delivering Trump\u2019s priority to build the border wall with Mexico.\n\nMcCarthy made that argument, too, lawmakers said, suggesting that those who lost their races \u2014 or came close to losing \u2014 didn\u2019t work hard enough to sell the GOP\u2019s message. At one point, ads featuring McCarthy were running promoting Trump\u2019s border wall.\n\nGOP Rep. Peter King of New York rose to object, saying his view was that Republicans lost ground over the GOP tax cuts that reduced deductions for some filers. The harsh immigration rhetoric that turned off suburban voters didn\u2019t help, he said.\n\n\u201cWe used to own the suburbs,\u201d King said. \u201cNow we\u2019re down to rural voters.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy relishes an underdog role, which channels the spirit of his hometown of Bakersfield in California\u2019s Central Valley, where he worked his way up from a congressional aide.\n\n\u201cWe think he\u2019s absolutely our best political strategist, our best fundraiser, our best recruiter,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma. \u201cAnd that\u2019s job No. 1 in getting back to the majority.\u201d\n\nBut after eight years of GOP control, the tea party class of 2010 is long gone. So too are the \u201cYoung Guns\u201d \u2014 former leader Eric Cantor and outgoing Speaker Ryan \u2014 who penned that strategy. Voters largely panned the party\u2019s latest signature accomplishment, Trump\u2019s tax cuts, and Republicans have all but abandoned the tea party promises to cut the deficit and repeal and replace former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nAmong those who opposed McCarthy, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, summed up his view of the Californian\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. \u201cHe\u2019s a savant at making friends,\u201d Massie said. \u201cRunning the country, probably not so much.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Matthew Daly, Kevin Freking, Laurie Kellman and Alan Fram in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/lisamascaro and AP\u2019s political coverage at https://apnews.com/apf-politics", "SARANAC LAKE, N.Y.

Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown said Wednesday that if Abrams loses it\u2019s because Republicans stole the election.\n\n\u201cIf Stacey Abrams doesn\u2019t win in Georgia, they stole it. I say that publicly, it\u2019s clear,\u201d Brown, speaking at a briefing for the National Action Network.\n\nKemp\u2019s campaign, which has repeatedly called on Abrams to concede, repeated that call Wednesday, saying Abrams and her supporters have used \u201cfake vote totals,\u201d \u2033desperate press conferences\u201d and \u201cdangerous lawsuits\u201d to try to steal the election.\n\nAP's Washington Bureau chief Julie Pace explains why outstanding races in Florida and Georgia have become so significant, that even President Donald Trump has taken to twitter about one of them.

This election is over.\u201d\n\nSince he declared himself governor last week and resigned as secretary of state, Kemp\u2019s lead has narrowed as counties have tabulated more ballots. And the numbers could change again as federal courts issue new guidance on counting certain provisional and absentee ballots.\n\nGroh-Wargo said Tuesday that the Abrams campaign believes she needs a net gain of 17,759 votes to pull Kemp below a majority threshold and force a Dec. 4 runoff. Kemp\u2019s campaign said even if every vote that Abrams campaign is arguing for is granted by the courts and counted for her, she cannot overcome his lead or force a runoff.\n\nThe Associated Press has not called the race.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. District Judge Steve Jones on Wednesday ruled that the secretary of state must not certify the state election results without confirming that each county\u2019s vote tally includes absentee ballots on which the voter\u2019s date of birth is missing or incorrect.\n\nThe order stems from a request in a lawsuit filed Sunday by the Abrams campaign. But Jones also rejected the campaign\u2019s other requests.\n\nHe declined to extend the period during which evidence could be submitted to prove the eligibility of voters who cast provisional ballots. He also declined to order that provisional ballots cast by voters who went to a precinct in the wrong county be counted.\n\nThe lawsuit was one of several election-related complaints filed before multiple federal judges.\n\nU.S. District Judge Leigh May ordered Gwinnett County election officials Tuesday not to reject absentee ballots just because the voter\u2019s birth year is missing or wrong. She also ordered the county to delay certification of its election results until those ballots have been counted.\n\nJones\u2019 ruling effectively extended May\u2019s order to the other 158 counties in Georgia.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg late Monday ordered state officials not to do their final certification of election results before 5 p.m. Friday.\n\nState law sets a Nov. 20 deadline, but secretary of state\u2019s office elections director Chris Harvey testified last week that the state had planned to certify the election results Wednesday, a day after the deadline for counties to certify their results. He said that would allow preparations to begin for any runoff contests, including those already projected in the races for secretary of state and a Public Service Commission seat.\n\nTotenberg\u2019s order left untouched the county certification deadline. Candice Broce, a spokeswoman for secretary of state\u2019s office, said Wednesday that all counties but Gwinnett have certified their totals.\n\nTotenberg also ordered the secretary of state\u2019s office to establish and publicize a hotline or website enabling voters to check whether their provisional ballots were counted and, if not, why not. And she ordered the secretary of state\u2019s office to review or have county election authorities review the eligibility of voters who had to cast provisional ballots because of registration issues.\n\nWith state lawmakers gathered at the Georgia Capitol Tuesday for the start of a special legislative session, dozens of protesters gathered in statehouse rotunda, loudly chanting \u201cCount every vote!\u201d and waving signs with the same slogan.

President Donald Trump has soured on Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and she is expected to leave her job as soon as this week. That\u2019s according to two people who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is weighing an administration-wide shake-up as he looks to prepare his White House for divided government, but it is unclear who is going and who is staying.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was thought to be out as soon as this week, according to two people with knowledge of the issue, but she is now likely to remain in the post for a longer period because there is no obvious successor in place.\n\nTrump has soured on Nielsen and White House chief of staff John Kelly, in part over frustration that his administration is not doing more to address what he has called a crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the people. But the scope of the contemplated changes is far broader, as Trump gears up for a wave of Democratic oversight requests and to devote more effort to his own re-election campaign.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the situation, Trump is also discussing replacing Kelly with Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Nick Ayers. Kelly, a retired Marine general, has been credited with bringing order and process to a chaotic West Wing, but he has fallen out of favor with the president as well as presidential daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nAyers, a seasoned campaign operative, would restore a political-mindset to the role, but he faces stiff opposition from some corners of the West Wing, with some aides lobbying Trump directly against the move.\n\nOther changes are afoot, as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke are being discussed for replacement. And in an extraordinary move Tuesday, first lady Melania Trump\u2019s office called publicly for the firing of Trump\u2019s deputy national security adviser, Mira Ricardel.\n\nFor all of the talk of churn, Trump often expresses frustration with aides and then does not take action. Talk of Kelly\u2019s exit has percolated for months and he remains in place.\n\nNielsen had hoped to complete one year in the job and leave in December, but it appeared unlikely she would last that long, said two sources. Both people who had knowledge of the debate spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nCurbing illegal immigration is Trump\u2019s signature issue \u2014 and one he returns to as a way to rally his most loyal supporters.\n\nBut anyone who takes over at Homeland Security is likely to run up against the same problems that Nielsen faced. The administration has already tried to clamp down at the border but those efforts have been largely thwarted or watered down due to legal challenges.\n\nTrump also told allies that he never fully trusted Nielsen, whom he associated with President George W. Bush, a longtime foe. And he told those close to him that he felt, at times, that her loyalty was more toward her longtime mentor \u2014 Kelly \u2014 than to the president.\n\nZinke, who faces several ethics investigations, said in interview with The Associated Press on Monday that he has spoken in recent days with Trump, Pence and Kelly about probes into his leadership and they remain supportive. He denied any wrongdoing.\n\nRoss addressed turnover rumors at a Yahoo! Finance summit Tuesday, saying he was in the post to give back to the country and support Trump.\n\n\u201cI worked very hard to get President Trump elected,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019d like to work equally hard to have him succeed and be re-elected.\u201d\n\nQuestions about Nielsen\u2019s job security are not new. Earlier this year, she pushed back on a New York Times report that she drafted a resignation letter but did not submit it, after Trump scolded her at a Cabinet meeting.\n\nNielsen has led the sprawling post-9/11 federal agency since December. She had been chief of staff to Kelly when he was Trump\u2019s first Homeland Security secretary. A DHS spokesman would not comment on whether she was leaving.\n\n\u201cThe secretary is honored to lead the men and women of DHS and is committed to implementing the president\u2019s security-focused agenda to protect Americans from all threats and will continue to do so,\u201d spokesman Tyler Houlton said.\n\nNielsen advocated for strong cybersecurity defense, and often said she believed the next terror major attack would occur online \u2014 not by planes or bombs. She was tasked with helping states secure elections following interference by Russians during the 2016 election.\n\nShe pushed Trump\u2019s immigration policies, including funding for his border wall and defended the administration\u2019s practice of separating children from parents, telling a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens \u201cin the United States every day.\u201d But she was also instrumental in stopping the separations.\n\nJust last week, the administration announced that migrants would be denied asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border if they crossed illegally, creating regulations that circumvent immigration laws stating anyone can claim asylum no matter how they arrive to the country. The decision would affect about 70,000 people annually and was immediately challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nNielsen also moved to abandon longstanding regulations that dictate how long children are allowed to be held in immigration detention, and requested bed space from the U.S. military for some 12,000 people in an effort to detain all families who cross the border. Right now there is space for about 3,000 families and they are at capacity.\n\nShe got into heated discussions with Trump and White House aides several times over immigration policy, as she sought to explain the complicated legal challenges behind immigration law and pushed for a more diplomatic approach.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who would replace her. The job requires Senate confirmation and there is no deputy secretary. Under Secretary for Management Claire Grady would be the acting head if Nielsen left.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writers Darlene Superville in Washington and Jonathan Lemire in New York contributed to this report.", "CHARLESTON, S.C.

(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 For more than a year, cities around the country waited in suspense over whether they\u2019d be chosen as Amazon\u2019s second home.\n\nThe online retail giant held the promise of 50,000 jobs and the possibility of changing their fortunes. So the 20 finalists dangled tax incentives, showcased their workforce and even signed nondisclosure agreements to keep the process secret \u2014 doing whatever it would take to woo the company.\n\nIn the end, Amazon decided to go with a safe bet. On Tuesday, it announced that it had picked for its new East Coast headquarters the buzzy New York neighborhood of Long Island City, Queens as well as a suburb of Washington, in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nAmazon could have chosen a city looking to be revitalized, like Newark, New Jersey. Instead, it opted to be close to two of the nation\u2019s centers of power. Both are waterfront communities away from overcrowded business districts, giving Amazon space to grow.\n\nThe reason Amazon gave: they are best suited to attract the high-skilled workers the company wants. The two sites will each get 25,000 jobs that Amazon said will pay an average of $150,000 a year.\n\nA person familiar with the plans says Amazon will split its second headquarters between Long Island City in New York and Crystal City in northern Virginia. The online retailer is expected to make an official announcement later Tuesday. (Nov. 13)\n\nThe company will receive more than $2 billion in tax credits and other incentives. New York is forking over more than $1.5 billion, while Virginia and Arlington are offering about a third of that \u2014 $573 million. The hope is that Amazon will attract other companies and ultimately boost the local economies. But while many see it as an opportunity, not everyone is sold on the idea.\n\n\u201cOffering massive corporate welfare from scarce public resources to one of the wealthiest corporations in the world at a time of great need in our state is just wrong,\u201d said New York State Sen. Michael Gianaris and New York City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, Democrats who represent the Long Island City area, in a joint statement.\n\nAmazon, which started as an online bookstore two decades ago, has grown to a behemoth that had nearly $180 billion in revenue last year. It now owns well-known brands, including grocer Whole Foods and online shoe-seller Zappos. It also makes movies and TV shows, runs an advertising business and offers cloud computing services to corporations and government agencies.\n\nThe company has more than 610,000 employees worldwide, making it the second largest U.S.-based, publicly-traded employer behind Walmart.\n\nBut it was the prospect of 50,000 jobs that led 238 communities across North America to pitch Amazon on why they should be home to the next headquarters.\n\nNew York is the nation\u2019s financial and media powerhouse and has been working to attract technology companies. Google already has more than 7,000 workers in the city and, according to media reports, is looking to add 12,000 more in coming years.\n\nArlington is directly across the Potomac River from Washington. Large government contractors have offices and lobbying operations there. However, many of its 1980s-era office buildings have vacancies after thousands of federal employees moved elsewhere. Being near the nation\u2019s capital could help Amazon with lobbying efforts as the company faces rising scrutiny from politicians.\n\nAmazon said it will spend $5 billion between both locations on construction and other projects.\n\nThe new outposts won\u2019t appear overnight. Amazon said hiring at the two headquarters will start next year, but it could take a decade or more to build out its offices.\n\nIts New York location will be in a neighborhood of Queens that sits directly across from midtown Manhattan. Once a bustling factory and freight-moving area, many of Long Island City\u2019s plants and warehouses closed as manufacturing left New York. The empty warehouses drew artists looking for affordable rents and businesses followed. Today, the neighborhood is made up of expensive, high-rise condos, with many more under construction.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Virginia offices will be in a part of Arlington that local politicians and Amazon are calling National Landing, an area around Reagan National Airport that encompasses Crystal City and Potomac Yard. Large parts are made up of vacant \u201970s and \u201980s-era office buildings. Among other challenges, Crystal City has fought to overcome a reputation for outdated architecture.\n\nVirginia state Sen. Adam Ebbin, a Democrat who represents the area where Amazon\u2019s new headquarters will be located, said that affordable housing may become an issue, but the announcement is a welcome development that will help increase the area\u2019s tax base to help ease overcrowding in schools and address other pressing needs.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s a double-edged sword,\u201d said Margo Williams, who lives in nearby Alexandria, Virginia. She said more workers in the area would increase tax revenues and bring better services for the community, but she worries traffic could get worse and the Metro more crowded.\n\nAmazon said it will refer to the new locations as headquarters, even though with 25,000 jobs each, they would have fewer workers than its Seattle hometown , which houses more than 45,000 employees.\n\nSeattle will remain one of Amazon\u2019s three headquarters, and the company said that senior executives will also be based in the two new locations. It plans to hold company-wide events at the new locations, including shareholder meetings.\n\nThere were early signs that Amazon had its sights set on New York and northern Virginia. Among its 20 finalists, the company had selected two locations in the New York metro area and three in the D.C. area. Plus, CEO and founder Jeff Bezos has a home in Washington D.C., and he personally owns The Washington Post newspaper.\n\nWhile it didn\u2019t win the main prize, Nashville, Tennessee, won\u2019t go empty handed. Amazon said the finalist city will be home to a new Amazon office with 5,000 jobs, focused on customer delivery and supply chain. Those jobs will also be paid an average of $150,000 a year, Amazon said.\n\n\u201cYou know, this is a huge win,\u201d said Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam. \u201cWhen we got this news, I think all of us were really, really excited about it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAlan Suderman in Richmond, Virginia, Matthew Barakat in Arlington County, Virginia, Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee, and Karen Matthews in New York contributed to this report.", "FILE- In this April 17, 2018, file photo a Southwest Airlines plane sits on the runway at the Philadelphia International Airport after it made an emergency landing in Philadelphia.

They described being unable to bring the woman back in the plane until two male passengers stepped in to help.\n\nThe harrowing details from the April 17 fatal flight were released for the first time as the National Transportation Safety Board began a hearing Wednesday into the engine failure on Southwest Flight 1380, which carried 144 passengers and five crew members.\n\nThe flight attendants told investigators at least one of the male passengers put his arm out of the window and wrapped it around the woman\u2019s shoulder to help pull her back in. Fernheimer said when she looked out the window, she could see that one of the plane\u2019s engines was shattered, and there was blood on the outside of the aircraft.\n\nFlight attendants asked for medical volunteers. A paramedic laid the woman across a row of seats and began chest compressions. They tried a defibrillator but it indicated that there was no shock. The paramedic and a nurse took turns at CPR.\n\nPassengers asked if they were going to die. Fernheimer said she squeezed their hands. \u201cShe told them that they were going to make it,\u201d an investigator wrote.\n\nPilots Tammie Jo Shults and Darren Ellisor landed the crippled Boeing 737 in Philadelphia. The passenger in the window seat, Jennifer Riordan, was fatally injured \u2014 the first death on a U.S. airline flight since 2009. Eight other passengers, including at least one of the men who helped pull Riordan back in the window, suffered minor injuries.\n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing in Washington focused on design and inspection of fan blades on the engine, made by CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France\u2019s Safran S.A.\n\nAn official from CFM defended the design and testing of fan blades like the one that snapped on the Southwest plane as it flew high above Pennsylvania, triggering an engine breakup that flung debris like shrapnel into the plane.\n\nAfter the fatal accident, CFM recommended the use of frequent and more sophisticated tests using ultrasound or electrical currents.\n\nAnother Southwest jet had suffered a similar blade-related engine breakup in 2016 over Florida.\n\nCFM and federal regulators considered the Florida incident an aberration.\n\n\u201cWe determined early that we would require some corrective action in that it was an unsafe condition,\u201d an FAA expert on engines, Christopher Spinney, testified on Wednesday, \u201cbut we also determined we had some time.\u201d\n\nRather than order immediate inspections of fan blades after the 2016 incident, the FAA began a slower process for drafting a regulation and getting public comment before enacting it. That process was still underway when the fatal accident occurred nearly two years later.\n\nSince the deadly flight, widespread inspections have turned up eight other fan blades on similar CFM engines that also had cracks. The fan blade that broke was last inspected six years earlier and, it was determined, suffered from metal fatigue even then \u2014 but it went unnoticed by a less sophisticated exam used at the time.\n\nFan blades have been thought to have no real lifetime limit. CFM and FAA officials said they were now considering whether blades must be replaced at some point even if they don\u2019t show wear.\n\nRepresentatives from CFM also testified about testing and certification of jet engines, which are supposed to be built to prevent pieces from breaking off and flying free.\n\nThe investigation is continuing. Most of Wednesday\u2019s hearing was highly technical. It was led by one of the safety board\u2019s five members, Bella Dinh-Zarr. The full board is expected to determine a probable cause for the accident in the next several months.\n\nMeanwhile, Riordan\u2019s husband, Michael, said in a statement on behalf of his family that they were \u201cgrateful for the heroic actions of the passengers who tried to save Jennifer\u2019s life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most important thing now is making sure that the aircraft and engine failures that caused Jennifer\u2019s untimely and unnecessary death never happen again,\u201d he said.", "FILE - In this Oct. 13, 2018, file photo, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg speaks at a Moms Demand Action gun safety rally at City Hall in Nashua, N.H.

(AP Photo/ Cheryl Senter)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Having spent a fortune to help elect Democrats this fall, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg declared lifetime allegiance to the Democratic Party and outlined an aggressive timeline for deciding whether to run for president.\n\n\u201cI think January, February would be about as late as you can do it and as early as you can gather enough information,\u201d Bloomberg told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday.\n\nThe 76-year-old billionaire said his decision would have little to do with other Democratic presidential prospects. He conceded that \u201cit\u2019s much too early to tell\u201d whether he has a legitimate chance of winning the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 and, with it, the chance to take on another New York billionaire, President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThanksgiving, Christmas and then maybe a few weeks into January \u2014 that\u2019s when you really gotta sit down, talk to your advisers and say, \u2018Look, do I have a chance?\u2019 I think I know why I would want to run. I think I know what I think this country should do and what I would do. But I just don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s possible,\u201d Bloomberg told the AP.\n\nHe added, \u201cIf people don\u2019t seem to be warming to you, there\u2019s plenty of other ways that I can make a difference in life and say thank you to this country for what it\u2019s given my kids and me.\u201d\n\nShould he run, Bloomberg would bring virtually limitless resources and a pragmatic governing approach to what is expected to be a massive 2020 Democratic field. Hardly a far-left liberal, he is described by his team as socially progressive and business-minded. He has spent tens of millions of dollars to promote liberal priorities on climate change, gun control and immigration.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear, however, whether there\u2019s room for Bloomberg in today\u2019s Democratic Party.\n\nTom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, offered a lukewarm assessment this week when asked about Bloomberg\u2019s $110 million investment in his party\u2019s 2018 midterm efforts.\n\n\u201cI applaud everybody who was involved,\u201d Perez said in an interview. \u201cVery appreciative of Mayor Bloomberg. Equally appreciative of those grassroots activists who were knocking on doors every weekend, texting people, investing 50 bucks in the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nStill, Bloomberg endeared himself to many Democratic leaders in recent months after deciding to invest more than $110 million in the 2018 midterms \u2014 largely focused on House races. Long an active political donor to candidates in both parties, Bloomberg gave almost exclusively to Democrats this year for the first time.\n\nThe decision, he explained, was born out of his concern that Republicans who controlled the House and Senate weren\u2019t providing an adequate check on the Trump presidency. Yet this political season marked a permanent shift in his political identity, he said.\n\n\u201cI will be a Democrat for the rest of my life,\u201d Bloomberg said.\n\nInitially registered as a Democrat, the Massachusetts native filed paperwork to change his voter registration to Republican in 2000 before his first run for New York City mayor, according to a spokesman. In June 2007, he unenrolled from the GOP, having no formal party affiliation until he registered again as a Democrat this October.\n\nMonths before that, Bloomberg directed his political team to work hand in hand with leading Democratic allies to shape the first nationwide election of Trump\u2019s presidency. His top aides even shared office space at times in the campaign\u2019s final days with the super PAC aligned with top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi.\n\nUltimately, Bloomberg\u2019s preferred candidates won all but three of two dozen targeted House races, focused overwhelmingly in America\u2019s suburbs.\n\nOnce it became clear Democrats seized the House majority, he said he delivered a stern message to Pelosi.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said to Nancy Pelosi: \u2018We don\u2019t expect you to do the same thing to the Republicans that the Republicans were doing to you. We want to have people working across the aisle for the benefit of America rather than for the benefit of their party,\u2019\u201d Bloomberg said.\n\nThat\u2019s a message Pelosi herself has articulated in recent weeks. Bloomberg reinforced it again in person on Tuesday as Pelosi met with his board of directors in private.\n\n\u201cI said, sitting next to her, without mincing words, I said, \u2018You know, we expect you to do a good job,\u2019\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we supported the Democrats.\u201d\n\nDemocratic officials poised to play leading roles in the next presidential election took notice of Bloomberg\u2019s investment.\n\nGuy Cecil, chairman of the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, described Bloomberg\u2019s midterm effort as \u201cincredibly helpful.\u201d It\u2019s unclear, however, whether Democratic voters who might favor younger, more liberal candidates in 2020 will see him any differently.\n\n\u201cDemocrats appreciate how much he has invested and how much his team has been engaged in the cycle, but ultimately it\u2019s going to be about what Bloomberg\u2019s vision is for the future,\u201d Cecil said.\n\nBloomberg acknowledged he has already formulated his justification for a presidential bid, but he declined to share it when asked. Still, he offered a message to any critics who might not think he belongs in today\u2019s Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has done more on the environment, on gun safety, on immigration, go right down the list,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cI was the one who stood up for gay marriage long before it became popular. I was the one at the national convention who said Trump was a con man. If you find anybody that\u2019s done more on these issues than I have, and the people that I\u2019ve been lucky enough to work with, please give me a call. I\u2019d like to hire \u2019em.\u201d", "BUFFALO, N.Y.

(Nov. 13)\n\nBetween 2002 and 2007, CIA doctors, psychologists, physician assistants and nurses were directly involved in the interrogation program, the report said. They evaluated, monitored and cared for 97 detainees in 10 secret CIA facilities abroad and accompanied detainees on more than 100 flights.\n\nThe CIA ultimately decided against asking the Justice Department to approve drug-assisted interrogations, sparing CIA doctors \u201csome significant ethical concerns,\u201d the report said. It had taken months for the Justice Department to sign off on brutal interrogation tactics, including sleep deprivation, confinement in small spaces and the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding. The CIA\u2019s counterterrorism team \u201cdid not want to raise another issue with the Department of Justice,\u201d the report said.\n\nBefore settling on Versed, the report said researchers studied records of old Soviet drug experiments as well as the CIA\u2019s discredited MK-Ultra program from the 1950s and 1960s that involved human experimentation with LSD and other mind-altering drugs on unwitting individuals as part of a long search for some form of truth serum. These experiments were widely criticized and, even today, some experts doubt an effective substance exists.\n\n\u201cBut decades later, the agency was considering experimenting on humans again to test pseudo-scientific theories of learned helplessness on its prisoners,\u201d Ladin said.\n\nVersed is a brand name for the sedative midazolam, used since the late 1970s and today sold commonly as a generic. It causes drowsiness and relieves anxiety and agitation. It also can temporarily impair memory, and often is used for minor surgery or medical procedures such as colonoscopies that require sedation but not full-blown anesthesia. It\u2019s in a class of anti-anxiety medications known as benzodiazepines that work by affecting a brain chemical that calms the activity of nerve cells.\n\n\u201cVersed was considered possibly worth a trial if unequivocal legal sanction first were obtained,\u201d the report said. \u201cThere were at least two legal obstacles: a prohibition against medical experimentation on prisoners and a ban on interrogational use of \u2018mind-altering drugs\u2019 or those which \u2018profoundly altered the senses.\u2019\u201d\n\nThose questions became moot after the CIA decided against asking the Justice Department to give it a green light. \u201cAt the beginning of 2003, the Office of Medical Services\u2019 review, informally termed \u2018Project Medication\u2019 was shelved, never to be reactivated,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe CIA had no comment on the report\u2019s release, but government lawyers emphasized in a court filing in the case early last year that the report, expressly marked \u201cdraft,\u201d was just one agency officer\u2019s impressions of the detention and interrogation program. The document is not the CIA\u2019s or the Office of Medical Service\u2019s \u201cfinal official history, or assessment, of the program,\u201d the lawyers wrote.\n\nThe ACLU spent more than two years in court trying to get the report released. In September 2017, a federal judge in New York ordered the CIA to release it. Government lawyers tried three more times to keep information contained in the report under wraps, but the ACLU received the bulk of the report in August. The government is still fighting to keep portions secret. They are to file briefs in a federal appeals court in New York on Wednesday, arguing that the judge ordered too much released.\n\nWhile the CIA\u2019s harsh interrogation program ended in 2007, the ACLU believes it\u2019s important to continue seeking the release of documents about it, especially since President Donald Trump declared during his campaign that he would approve interrogating terror suspects with waterboarding, which is now banned by U.S. law, and a \u201chell of a lot worse.\u201d\n\nCIA Director Gina Haspel, who was involved in supervising a secret CIA detention site in Thailand where detainees were waterboarded, told the Senate during her confirmation hearing that she does \u201cnot support use of enhanced interrogation techniques for any purpose.\u201d\n\nThe report cites many instances where medical personal expressed concern or protected the health of the detainees. Those who were thrown up against walls \u2014 a practice called \u201cwalling\u201d \u2014 had their necks protected from whiplash by rolled towels around their necks, the report said. When one detainee, who had been wounded during capture, was confined to a box, care was taken not to force his legs into a position that \u201cwould compromise wound healing.\u201d Physician assistants overruled using duct tape over the mouths of detainees during flights because air sickness could lead to vomiting and possible aspiration.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that the doctors were sadistic or anything like that,\u201d Ladin said. \u201cBut it means they were complicit because this pseudo-scientific torture could not have happened without the doctors\u2019 participation.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the medical office\u2019s report said waterboarding was not \u201cintrinsically painful.\u201d It said there was \u201cphysical discomfort from the occasional associated retching,\u201d but that two detainees who endured the most extensive waterboarding sessions complained only \u201cof the pain of the restraining straps.\u201d\n\nThat contrasts with the Senate\u2019s 2014 report on the CIA\u2019s interrogation program, which stated that a prisoner known as Abu Zubaydah, a suspected al-Qaida operative who was waterboarded more than 80 times, \u201ccried, begged, pleaded, vomited, and required medical resuscitation after being waterboarded.\u201d\n\nSome CIA medical personnel called waterboarding \u201clittle more than an amateurish experiment\u201d and others worried that the practice would trigger spasms of the vocal cords, which could, at least temporarily, make it hard to speak or breathe.\n\nAt the same time, other medical personnel contended waterboarding actually \u201cprovided periodic relief\u201d to a prisoner because it was a break from being forced to stand for long periods of time. The agency medical personnel also said the harsh interrogation program was \u201creassuringly free of enduring physical or psychological effects.\u201d\n\nDr. Sondra Crosby, who has treated victims of torture, including two who were held at CIA secret sites, disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe enduring pain and suffering experienced by the survivors of the CIA program is immense, and includes severe, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, physical ailments, and psychosocial dysfunction,\u201d said Crosby, of Boston University\u2019s School of Medicine and Public Health. \u201cAt least one detainee was tortured to death. Their physical and psychological scars will last a lifetime.\u201d\n\n____\n\nAP Medical Writer Lauran Neergaard in Washington contributed to this report.", "U.S. Rep.

(AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty)\n\nBANGOR, Maine (AP) \u2014 A federal judge heard arguments Wednesday aimed at stopping Maine\u2019s unusual ranked-balloting system, even as election staffers scanned votes to determine the winner of last week\u2019s congressional race.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin and three activists sued Tuesday to overturn Maine\u2019s new voting system. U.S. District Judge Lance Walker heard arguments Wednesday about whether to halt the vote-counting process until he has time to rule on the system\u2019s constitutionality.\n\nWalker indicated he would rule as soon as Thursday on the request to halt vote-counting. The state\u2019s elections chief also said workers were resuming the counting with an eye toward completing it Thursday.\n\nSupporters and opponents of ranked-choice voting were eagerly awaiting both results, and wondering which would come first. Walker\u2019s ruling could have major implications for the future of the voting method, which was approved by Maine voters but has drawn ire from Poliquin and others who believe it is confusing and violates the concept of one person, one vote.\n\nJames Monteleone, an attorney who has represented ranked-choice voting supporters, has called the lawsuit \u201cfrivolous,\u201d but Poliquin has described the system as too \u201cconvoluted\u201d and \u201cchaotic\u201d for voters.\n\n\u201cThe ranked-choice voting process has been repeatedly affirmed by the people of Maine,\u201d Monteleone said Wednesday.\n\nThe first round of voting on Election Day ended with Poliquin and Democrat Jared Golden both collecting about 46 percent of the vote in Maine\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. Poliquin held a slim edge and declared himself the \u201cfair and square\u201d winner.\n\nBut the ranked-choice system adopted by Maine voters in 2016 requires additional voting rounds in which last-place candidates are eliminated and votes reallocated until there is a majority winner.\n\nIf the system stands, either Poliquin or Golden will be the first member of Congress elected by such a method.\n\nElection officials are set to resume the count Thursday, Secretary of State Matt Dunlap, a Democrat, said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving on a pretty fast track,\u201d said Dunlap, who declined to comment on the court case.\n\nA pair of independents who ran in the congressional race, Tiffany Bond and Will Hoar, had encouraged voters to rank each other first and second on the ballot. They combined for about 8 percent of the vote total.\n\nBond and Golden filed court papers to intervene in the federal case Wednesday.\n\nPoliquin and the other plaintiffs were seeking a temporary restraining order to halt vote counting and prevent the state from certifying a winner in the election. That would effectively throw the election into limbo while Walker, the judge, rules on the constitutionality of ranked choice voting.\n\nWalker became a U.S. district judge a little less than a month ago after the U.S. Senate approved his nomination by President Donald Trump.\n\nMaine\u2019s use of a ranked system in U.S. House and Senate races was a first in American history. Two other races that used the system were decided by wide enough margins that additional counting was not needed.\n\nThe system isn\u2019t used in Maine state races because of concerns it could violate the state\u2019s constitution, but it is used in state primaries and federal races.\n\n___\n\nWhittle reported from Portland, Maine.", "WASHINGTON, D.C.

Many migrants say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. (AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Did someone say caravan?\n\nOne week after Election Day, President Donald Trump\u2019s daily drumbeat of warnings about a caravan of \u201cbad thugs\u201d and potential terrorists intent on invading the U.S. from Mexico has largely fallen silent.\n\nThe migrant caravans are still trudging along, the largest still about 1,000 miles from the southern border, but Trump \u2014 and many in the conservative media \u2014 have dramatically reduced the frequency and intensity of their dire warnings now that they no longer feel the same urgency to stir up GOP voters.\n\nTrump and his media allies have largely moved on. They\u2019re more focused now on the possibility of electoral chicanery in recounts in Florida\u2019s Senate and governor\u2019s races.\n\nWithin the West Wing and in Trump\u2019s orbit of allies, there is a sense that the caravan was a useful midterm messaging tool, one that became the centerpiece of an eleventh-hour pre-election strategy modeled on the president\u2019s 2016 campaign pledges to crack down on illegal immigration, according to four White House officials and outside advisers not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.\n\nBut once the election was over, the president\u2019s attention turned elsewhere, the officials and advisers said.\n\nFor weeks before the election, the caravan was a dominant news story. The largest caravan was believed to have formed in Honduras on Oct. 12 and first was featured in a \u201cFox & Friends\u201d segment four days later, which prompted a tweet from the show\u2019s most famous fan.\n\nAs the midterms approached, Trump and his conservative allies flooded the zone with harsh rhetoric and hardline policy proposals, including sending troops to the border, revoking birthright citizenship and an ad featuring a Latino man convicted of killing two police officers that was widely condemned as racist.\n\nBut the caravan was Trump\u2019s favorite talking point. During his final blitz of campaign rallies, he hammered at the threat night after night and, without evidence, suggested that Democrats were supporting \u2014 and perhaps funding \u2014 the march of migrants.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are inviting caravan after caravan of illegal aliens to pour into our country, overwhelming your schools, your hospitals, and your communities,\u201d Trump said in Fort Wayne, Indiana, on election eve. \u201cIf you want more caravans, if you want more crime, vote Democrat tomorrow. ... If you want strong borders and safe communities, no drugs, no caravans, vote Republican.\u201d\n\nTrump ratcheted up his rhetoric on Twitter too. One tweet read: \u201cWe will NOT let these Caravans, which are also made up of some very bad thugs and gang members, into the U.S. Our Border is sacred, must come in legally. TURN AROUND!\u201d\n\nThat tweet, on Oct. 31, was his last on the subject. Since the election, he\u2019s invoked the caravan only once. Asked about it during a news conference last Wednesday, Trump said \u201cI\u2019m not just talking about the caravans\u201d when talking about militarizing the southern border and his proposed wall.\n\nThe thousands of Central American migrants in the largest caravan have been leapfrogging their way across western Mexico, despite the prospect of a hostile reception at the border. Most appeared intent on taking the Pacific coast route northward to the border city of Tijuana, which was still about 1,350 miles (2,200 kilometers) away.\n\nOn Friday, Trump signed a proclamation restricting asylum applications but did so with little fanfare and no press coverage before he departed for a trip to Paris. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether further action on immigration was imminent.\n\n\u201cClearly, this was an election-eve stunt designed to whip up the base that really didn\u2019t have much foundation in fact and, clearly, when the election was over there was no need to keep beating those drums,\u201d said Mark Feldstein, journalism professor at the University of Maryland. He added that what the conservative media did with the story was \u201creally toxic\u201d and divided an already polarized country.\n\n\u201cThe very fact that they dropped it so suddenly is just further confirmation of how bogus the story was in the first place,\u201d Feldstein said.\n\nFox News spent more than 33 hours discussing the caravan through Election Day, according to a study by Media Matters, a progressive media watchdog organization. On Nov. 7, the day after the election, Fox had no discussions centered on the caravan. On Nov. 8, the network spent four minutes and 57 seconds on discussions centered on the caravan, according to the study.\n\nSome Republicans said the caravan\u2019s fade from the spotlight was a natural part of the election cycle.\n\n\u201cEvery election, there are a series of issues that rise to artificial highs and then, once the votes are cast, settle back down to normal noise,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, former press secretary to President George W. Bush. \u201cBoth parties do it; this isn\u2019t some trumped up phony issue. The caravan will be back in the news once it gets closer to the border.\u201d\n\nTrump had suggested sending up to 15,000 troops to the border; currently there are approximately 1,000 at the border itself and another 4,800 in staging areas nearby. The deployment is scheduled to end Dec. 15 but that could be changed, extended or shortened.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis plans to visit the border Wednesday. He was asked by a reporter Tuesday whether the military mission along the border of south Texas will change, now that the lead migrant caravan in Mexico is headed much farther west.\n\n\u201cRight now, the mission is exactly what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what the future holds.

New Mexico (2-0) also got 14 from Anthony Mathis.\n\nManigault\u2019s steal and highlight reel dunk in the midst of an 11-2 New Mexico second-half run helped turn a 72-67 deficit into a 75-72 lead and control of the game with 6:05 left.\n\n\u201cWe won because of those two guys,\u201d Lobos coach Paul Weir said while pointing at Jackson and Manigault. \u201cWhenever Corey and whenever Vance can play the way they do, it\u2019s going to help us tremendously. .Vance is such a talented player. His ceiling here is through the roof. And Corey is the exact same way. I want to kill him sometimes and I think he wants to kill me too.

Every time he shoots he\u2019s probably thinking way too much than he should so when they go in, you feel for him.\u201d\n\nThe critical run, along with Kuiper\u2019s three and a subsequent one from Mathis was the difference in the game, said Iona coach Tim Cluess.\n\n\u201cWe left a couple of their shooters open and they got two good open looks on us and they made them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got good looks that didn\u2019t go down.

Iona will not return to its home court again until Dec. 30.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d Cluess said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m looking forward to our guys coming together as a group and playing the good competition we\u2019re going to be playing and learning a lot more about our team.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone)\n\nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) \u2014 The Washington Capitals woke up in Minnesota for the start of a four-game road trip with a pleasant surprise: Tom Wilson was back.\n\nSo was the vigor for the Stanley Cup champions, who\u2019ve started their title-defense season rather slowly.\n\nWilson returned early from his player-safety suspension and scored a first-period goal, helping the Capitals cool off the Wild with a 5-2 victory on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a key player for our team. Brings so much energy both on the ice and off the ice, so a huge lift for the team to get him back,\u201d said Andre Burakovsky, who had a goal and an assist.\n\nDmitry Orlov had his first two goals of the season and an assist, T.J. Oshie also scored and backup goalie Pheonix Copley made 26 saves for the Capitals, who welcomed Wilson back to the right wing on the first line with captain Alex Ovechkin and center Evgeny Kuznetsov. An arbitrator\u2019s reduction of Wilson\u2019s 20-game ban for an illegal blindside hit to the head in a preseason game made him immediately eligible again.\n\n\u201cIt was a good game by the fellas, and it felt good to put together a good 60 minutes,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cHopefully we can get this thing going a little.\u201d\n\nMikko Koivu and Matt Dumba had goals for the Wild, who played at home for the first time in 17 days after a 5-2 finish on their franchise-record seven-game road swing. They fell to 5-1-2 at Xcel Energy Center, becoming the last team in the NHL to lose at home in regulation this season.\n\n\u201cYou get spoiled. They weren\u2019t as good as they were for the last 12 games,\u201d said coach Bruce Boudreau, whose club was 10-2 over the previous four weeks.\n\nThe Wild have given up the first goal in 13 of their 18 games, though they entered the night tied for the best record in the league in those situations at 8-3-1. Orlov\u2019s snap shot scraped the crossbar and found the back of the upper right corner just 6:33 into the game.\n\nThen Orlov, who was recently split up with usual blue-line partner Matt Niskanen in an attempt by first-year coach Todd Reirden to seek a spark amid the sluggish start, set up Wilson in his season debut. Orlov maneuvered around Dumba and fed Wilson for a one-timer with 27.4 seconds left before the first intermission .\n\nRyan Suter was chasing Wilson, who was caught between the defenseman and Devan Dubnyk in a collision that knocked the Wild goalie to the ice and left him down and dazed for a moment. Wilson picked up a goaltender interference penalty while scoring the goal. He was second in the NHL in penalty minutes last season.\n\n\u201cThe puck went in the net before he touched the goalie, so there wasn\u2019t much you could do about it,\u201d Boudreau said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way he plays.\u201d\n\nEric Staal thought he had a goal for the Wild early in the second period, but that was waved off because he kicked the puck, one of several near-misses for the Wild. Instead, Burakovsky scored soon after for a 3-0 lead. Suter and Dumba, the first blue-line pair, were on the ice for each of the first three goals.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t look like we were connecting very well, and some of the mental mistakes we made are going to cost you against a good offensive team,\u201d Staal said.\n\nThe Wild went a whopping 14:03 without a shot on goal, until Staal\u2019s wrist shot was stopped by Copley. Koivu\u2019s backhander trickled through Copley\u2019s pads to put the Wild on the board about a minute later, and Marcus Foligno tried to keep the momentum going by dropping the gloves and fighting Wilson. The Wild had 22 of their 28 shots in the second half of the game, but they just couldn\u2019t convert enough of those chances.\n\nWilson just finished serving his fourth suspension in a little more than a year, this for a blindside hit to the head of an opponent during a preseason game . His presence gave Washington\u2019s lagging penalty kill a boost.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect him to have as strong a game as he did,\u201d Rierden said.\n\nDumba\u2019s goal was the only tally for Minnesota in six power-play opportunities. The Capitals, who entered the night ranked third-worst in the league on the penalty kill, allowed six power-play goals over their previous four games.\n\nNOTES: This was the eighth straight win by the Capitals over the Wild, whose last win in the series was at Washington on March 5, 2015. All but one of the victories by the Capitals during the streak have come in regulation. ... This was the third two-goal game of Orlov\u2019s 382-game career. ... Staal has 30 goals and 44 assists in 77 career games against the Capitals, his most points against any other team. ... With his 341st career goal, Parise passed Dave Christian to become the leading scorer among Minnesota-born players in NHL history. ...

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nPORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) \u2014 After three decades of promoting free trade as a panacea to poverty, the APEC grouping of nations that includes the U.S. and China is holding its lavish annual leaders\u2019 meeting in the country that can least afford it.\n\nBarely penetrated by roads and scarred by violence, Papua New Guinea hopes the parade of world leaders will lift the mountainous Pacific nation of hundreds of tribal groups out of obscurity and attract investment.\n\nBut the expense has brought criticism when the government has a budget crisis, basic medicines are scarce, and polio, eliminated from all but a handful of countries, has returned. In 2015, the International Monetary Fund estimated that upgrading the capital for the event and hosting a year of related meetings could cost $1 billion.\n\nAustralia, the biggest foreign aid donor to Papua New Guinea and former colonial occupier, as well as China and other countries have absorbed some of the cost but critics have already been given plenty of vindication.\n\nIn an eye-popping move, the government imported 40 luxury Maserati cars to whisk VIPs among convention venues in the secure bubble of the APEC meetings. Officials said the government would sell them to recover the cost, sparking more disbelief and suspicions of a corrupt scheme.\n\nChinese government money, meanwhile, has built what has been dubbed a boulevard to nowhere in the capital Port Moresby, a city described by the World Bank as among the world\u2019s most violent due to high unemployment and brazen criminal gangs known as \u201craskols.\u201d\n\nA VIP terminal costing about $19 million was added to the city\u2019s airport. Construction of an iconic building \u201cAPEC Haus\u201d for the leaders\u2019 summit was paid for by oil and gas company Oil Search, which operates all of Papua New Guinea\u2019s oil fields, in exchange for tax credits. That avoided an immediate cost for the government but will erode its revenue in the future.\n\n\u201cI think the money should have been used to fix our backyard instead of decorating the front porch. We have health, education and infrastructure deficiencies that need to be addressed,\u201d said activist and writer Martyn Namorong.\n\n\u201cMany teachers haven\u2019t been paid and hospitals lack medicines,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is so much misery experienced by ordinary Papua New Guineans while the elite party with the world like there is no tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWhat the weeklong talkfest will produce, other than its signature photo of world leaders in locally themed shirts, is unclear. In the impenetrable language of APEC, the meeting is about \u201cHarnessing Inclusive Opportunities, Embracing the Digital Future.\u201d\n\nAllan Bollard, executive director of the APEC secretariat, said the meeting is complicated by the tensions between China and the U.S. over trade and the broader backlash against globalization \u2014 the dominant Western-led ideology over the past four decades that freer trade and movement of people is inevitably good for all.\n\n\u201cThis year we\u2019ve had more bilateral trade friction, between the U.S. and China in particular, and that does make it more complex around the table in the sense that APEC only does initiatives where everybody agrees,\u201d Bollard said.\n\nPort Moresby, a city where foreigners and the local elite live in homes barricaded behind high walls and barbed wire, will host more than 12,000 visitors for the meetings that end on Sunday.\n\nBecause of a shortage of hotels, many will stay in three cruise ships docked at Port Moresby and be shuttled back and forth in some of the hundreds of vehicles imported for the event. The city will be crawling with police and military, some of them from Australia and New Zealand, who are providing air force planes, navy patrol boats, special forces and other personnel.\n\nAustralian media reports say Canberra is spending more than $100 million on security and other support for APEC. The Australian prime minister\u2019s office declined to release a figure, calling the assistance an \u201cextension of long-term cooperation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe security is going to be so tight,\u201d said Jonathan Pryke, a Papua New Guinea expert at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. \u201cThis is going to be the safest time to be in Port Moresby.\u201d\n\nEven so, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and his entourage will be flying into the country each day from northern Queensland in Australia.\n\nOutside of the spruced-up capital, 2018 has been a year of renewed tribal and political violence.\n\nEarlier this month, rioting engulfed the coastal town of Alotau more than 300 kilometers (186 miles) from Port Moresby after police leaving for APEC killed a woman and her child in a road accident, said the town\u2019s Catholic Bishop Rolando Santos. Gunfights erupted when police reinforcements arrived from the capital, he said. The growth of a Chinese diaspora, said Pryke, has also fueled economic tensions that have led to protests and riots.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t much funds for education, health,\u201d said Santos, a Filipino who\u2019s lived in Papua New Guinea for 17 years. \u201cMany were affected because of APEC.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s Catholic Bishops Conference has criticized dire shortages of basic services while the government poured resources into getting the capital ready for world leaders.\n\n\u201cWe share the concern of many about the huge amount of our limited resources being expended on this event which seems designed to entertain and impress the rich and powerful,\u201d said its president Rochus Tatamai.\n\nPapua New Guineans, he said, are \u201csuffering and dying in order to make APEC a success.\u201d", "Buffalo Sabres forward Jeff Skinner (53) and Tampa Bay Lightning forward Brayden Point (21) battle for the puck during the first period of an NHL hockey game, Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018, in Buffalo N.Y. (AP Photo/Jeffrey T. Barnes)\n\nBUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 Frantic as the final minute appeared, Buffalo Sabres goalie Carter Hutton reveled in the challenge of staring down Nikita Kucherov and the high-scoring Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\n\u201cIt was mayhem,\u201d Hutton said after stopping 29 shots to preserve a 2-1 win over the Eastern Conference-leading Lightning on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cTruthfully, you embrace the battle,\u201d he added. \u201cYou get to show what you\u2019re made of and it was fun.\u201d\n\nIt was a lot more fun for him after Kucherov hit the same post twice in the final 30 seconds from essentially the same spot in the lower right circle. The second opportunity came when Steven Stamkos fed a pass through the middle to Kucherov, whose one-timer hit the post and caromed wide just before the final buzzer.\n\nNo problem, Hutton said with a wide grin. He had the angle covered.\n\nJeff Skinner scored his team-leading 13th goal and Kyle Okposo also scored, and the suddenly resurgent Sabres won their third straight. Defenseman Nathan Beaulieu had two assists, and Buffalo improved to 10-6-2 for its best start since opening 11-7 in 2011-12.\n\nAnthony Cirelli scored for the Lightning, who lost consecutive games for the first time since an 0-3 skid from March 24-29 last season. Lightning backup Louis Domingue finished with 17 saves.\n\nAfter slamming his stick on the glass as the game ended, Kucherov\u2019s frustrations carried over into the locker room upon being reminded of his two missed opportunities.\n\n\u201cMy thoughts? It (stinks) when you don\u2019t score,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it happens. It happened today. For us, forget this game as soon as possible and move forward.\u201d\n\nThe Sabres limited the NHL\u2019s top offense to one goal after Tampa Bay had scored four or more in each of its past five games.\n\nSkinner opened the scoring with 2:15 left in the first period, when he was parked in front and converted a rebound after Domingue stopped Sam Reinhart\u2019s shot from the top of the right circle.\n\nThe Sabres somehow matched the Lightning in scoring one goal apiece in the second period despite being outshot 14-2.\n\nHutton held the fort in making numerous clutch stops starting from the opening minute, when he foiled Stamkos driving in alone across the front.\n\nOkposo put Buffalo up 2-0 at the 5:43 mark of the period when he used defender Victor Hedman as a screen and scored on a low shot from the right circle that fooled Domingue.\n\nThe Lightning responded 15 seconds later, when Alex Killorn flipped a pass from his own blue line and over two Sabres defenders, including a leaping Rasmus Dahlin. The puck landed on the stick of Cirelli, who scored on a breakaway by beating Hutton high on the glove side.\n\nThe Sabres\u2019 three-game winning streak is their second of the season. Buffalo won three straight just once a year ago, when the team finished last in the NHL standings for the third time in five seasons.\n\nThough relieved to pull out the win, Okposo said the Sabres were too passive in trying to nurse the one-goal lead.\n\n\u201cWe were on our heels a little too much,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sharp. We\u2019ve got to clean up some stuff. I know we\u2019ve won the last three games, but we probably only played real good for a period and a half.\u201d\n\nOkposo then laughed when asked if he would\u2019ve complained after a three-game winning streak last season.\n\n\u201cYeah, probably not,\u201d he said. \u201cBut our standard\u2019s higher this year.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Lightning D Erik Cernak made his NHL debut after being called up from Syracuse of the AHL earlier in the day.

Protectionism and anti-globalization sentiments are on the rise. This can have a devastating impact on the regional as well as the global economy, and business confidence in Asia is already being affected,\u201d Lee said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we redouble our economic integration efforts and maintain a free, open and rules-based multilateral trading system which has underpinned our growth and prosperity,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump withdrew from a Pacific Rim trade initiative, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, just after taking office last year. That trade pact is due to take effect on Dec. 30. The U.S. is not part of the RCEP initiative, which includes China, India, Australia and most other Asian economies.\n\nLee said participating countries had finished seven of 18 chapters in their agreement and shown \u201cstrong political will\u201d to finish it. He warned that further delays in reaching an agreement, already in negotiations for six years, would damage the RCEP\u2019s credibility.\n\n\u201cWe are now at the final stage of negotiations.

China is pitted against its smaller neighbors in multiple disputes in the sea over coral reefs and lagoons in waters crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves.\n\nWhile in Singapore, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has sought to reassure China\u2019s neighbors.\n\n\u201cWe have found the way to properly manage and defuse differences, for example, on the issue of the South China Sea in the past years,\u201d Li said, adding that the situation was moving toward \u201cgreater stability\u201d with progress toward a single draft text on a code of conduct in the sea.

(AP) \u2014 Taylor Hall gave the New Jersey Devils just what they needed after a dismal seven-game trip \u2014 an MVP-type performance.\n\nHall scored the game-winning goal on a breakaway at 8:07 of the third period added an empty-net tally to cap a four-point night and lead the Devils to a 4-2 victory over the struggling Pittsburgh Penguins on Tuesday night.\n\nTravis Zajac and Damon Severson each had a goal and an assist as the Devils snapped a three-game losing streak by beating the Penguins for the second time in just over a week. Keith Kinkaid had 29 saves for New Jersey, which was returning home after a 1-6 trip.\n\n\u201cNot just a win but an effort we can be proud of,\u201d said Hall, last season\u2019s MVP. \u201cIt\u2019s not an effort where we solely relied on our goaltender to steal a game. We did a good job of eliminating chances against a high-powered team. Our game has to continue to grow that way and when we play strong in our end, it allows us to just play more free up the ice and create more, have the puck more. It was solid night for us.\u201d\n\nPhil Kessel and Jake Guentzel scored for the Penguins, who have one win in seven games (1-5-1). Casey DeSmith had 31 saves in his third straight start.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because we are trying to find wins right now and we can\u2019t seem to find them with any level of consistency,\u201d Penguins coach Mike Sulllivan said. \u201cI thought we had spurts in the game where we were good, then some of the goals they scored, we didn\u2019t force them to work hard enough for them. That for me is discouraging.\u201d\n\nHall\u2019s game-winner came a little less than four minutes after Guentzel tied the game. It came on a quick counterattack. Kyle Palmieri sent a pass from the Devils\u2019 defensive end to Zajac at the Penguins\u2019 blue line. Zajac sent a pass to Hall coming down the middle, and last year\u2019s MVP made one move and slid a soft shot between DeSmith\u2019s legs.\n\n\u201cHe called for it,\u201d Zajac said of the pass to Hall. \u201cI kind of saw him, but he called for it and I just had to kind of whack it over to him and he made a great play.\u201d\n\nDeSmith was clearly frustrated after the play. He seemed to read Hall\u2019s move and felt he got a piece of the puck.\n\n\u201cWe had worked hard to tie it up and like I said, the team needed a save and I didn\u2019t make it in that situation. I feel responsible for that,\u201d DeSmith said.\n\nThe Devils, who are 6-1-1 at home, took leads of 1-0 and 2-1 only to see the Penguins tie it.\n\nGuentzel\u2019s sixth goal of the season tied the game at 2 after withstanding a challenge by New Jersey coach John Hynes, who claimed Sidney Crosby interfered with Kinkaid.\n\nKinkaid had stopped Crosby\u2019s semi-breakaway, but the skate of the Penguins\u2019 star knocked the goaltender to the ice, leaving Guentzel an open net to shoot at with the rebound.\n\nAfter reviewing the goal, the referees ruled Devils forward Blake Coleman caused the problem by pushing Crosby in the back.\n\nZajac scored just 28 seconds into the game after DeSmith had trouble covering a Severson rebound.\n\nThe Penguins tied the score 1-all with Kessel\u2019s power-play goal at 13:19. Crosby held the puck in the right circle and fired a pass to Kessel stationed at the left edge of the net for a slam dunk.\n\nNew Jersey grabbed the lead again in the second period. After DeSmith stopped Hall in close, New Jersey kept the puck in the zone and Severson scored from between the circles after taking a pass from Hall.\n\nNew Jersey thought it had a 3-1 lead at 14:20 when Jesper Bratt scored on a breakaway, but the officials had blown the play dead because Kessel and Brett Seney were fighting in the Pittsburgh end.\n\nThe Penguins nearly tied it on the ensuing Devils power play, but Bryan Rust\u2019s short-handed shot was kept out by a combination of Kinkaid and the goalpost.\n\nNOTES: Goaltender Martin Brodeur, who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame Monday, dropped a puck in a ceremonial opening faceoff before the game. ...

They took the lead with two quick goals and then pulled away in the third period for a confidence-building win.\n\nTom Kuhnhackl scored two unusual goals to lead the Islanders to a 5-2 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cWe definitely didn\u2019t have the start we wanted,\u201d Kuhnhackl said. \u201cAfter they scored that first goal we had a great response throughout that first period. We knew they were going to have a push in the second period. We just had to weather the storm.\u201d\n\nJordan Eberle had a goal and an assist, and Josh Bailey and Cal Clutterbuck also scored for the Islanders, who had won five straight before their losing streak. Mathew Barzal and Brock Nelson each had two assists and Thomas Greiss stopped 22 shots.\n\n\u201cJust because it\u2019s not April doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a must-win,\u201d Clutterbuck said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to give a five-game winning streak back. We knew today we had to dig in and win it.\u201d\n\nNew York improved to 5-0-2 in the last seven meetings with Vancouver.\n\nBrendan Leipsic had a goal and an assist, and Jake Virtanen also scored for the Canucks, who have lost two straight after a 4-0-2 stretch. Jacob Markstrom, starting for the ninth consecutive game with Anders Nilsson injured, finished with 29 saves.\n\nVancouver, coming off a 2-1 loss across town against the Rangers on Monday night, fell to 1-2-2 on a six-game trip.\n\n\u201cThis was deflating,\u201d Canucks coach Travis Green said. \u201cIt was one of those nights. I like how we battled back. But down two on the road, you can be a little tired. It was a disappointing loss.\u201d\n\nKuhnhackl got his second of the game at 3:26 of the third period as Eberle\u2019s pass from the right corner deflected off Kuhnhackl\u2019s stick, a Vancouver defenseman\u2019s stick, and then Kuhnhackl\u2019s skate and in to push the Islanders\u2019 lead to 4-2. The goal stood after a video review, giving Kuhnhackl his first career multi-goal game.\n\nClutterbuck scored a power-play goal with 2:54 left, the Islanders\u2019 first in four games with the man-advantage. It was also Clutterbuck\u2019s first goal since Jan. 13 against the Rangers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst thing is there\u2019s a lot of self-doubt that creeps in. Ten games, 15 games is one thing, but when it\u2019s that long you begin to doubt your own ability. ... It\u2019s a big relief.\u201d\n\nTrailing 3-1 after one period, the Canucks pulled within one on a power-play goal early in the second as Virtanen knocked in a rebound in front for his eighth of the season at 2:51.\n\nLeipsic got the Canucks on the scoreboard first, taking a pass from Michael Del Zotto at the bottom of the left circle and beating Greiss up high for his second of the season 2:48 into the game.\n\nThe Islanders went ahead with two goals 45 seconds apart. Kuhnhackl tied it on a delayed penalty on Vancouver as he swiped a backhander from his knees while falling down below the left circle, and the puck managed to sneak in between Markstrom\u2019s right pad and the post at 5:11.\n\n\u201cI tried to spin away from the defenseman, and I thought I got tripped and they got a penalty,\u201d Kuhnhackl said, \u201cso I just tried to throw it on net and I was fortunate enough the puck went in.\u201d\n\nNew York went ahead when Bailey tried to send a pass across to Anders Lee at the right side of the net, but the puck deflected off the skate of Vancouver defenseman Christopher Tanev and in at 5:56.

The South Korean boy band ran into more troubles after news broke out that another member wore a hat featuring a Nazi symbol in a magazine photo book and band members flew flags with what appeared to be the Nazi swastika during a concert in the past.\n\n\u201cWe would like to again offer our sincerest apologies to anyone who has suffered pain, distress and discomfort due to our shortcomings and oversight in ensuring that these matters receive our most careful attention,\u201d the band\u2019s agency, the Big Hit Entertainment, said in a statement.\n\nThe T-shirt portrayed an atomic bombing juxtaposed with the celebration of Korea\u2019s 1945 liberation from Japan at the end of the World War II. The United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki before Tokyo\u2019s surrender.\n\nBefore its division into North and South Korea after the liberation, the Korean Peninsula was colonized by Japan from 1910-1945. Many in both Koreas still harbor strong resentment against the Japanese colonial masters. But in South Korea, it\u2019s extremely rare for anyone to publicly celebrate or mock the atomic bombings. The atomic bombings killed more than 200,000 people in Japan. A South Korean government estimate says about 40,000 of the dead were Koreans, while a victims\u2019 group put the Korean death toll at 50,000, many forcefully mobilized as laborers by Japan.\n\nSouth Korean politicians criticized the Japanese broadcasters\u2019 decisions to cancel BTS appearances, accusing Japan of harboring \u201cself-centered views on history\u201d and letting politics interfere with cultural exchanges.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear the T-shirt controversy is seriously affecting the band\u2019s huge popularity in Japan, with 50,000 people reportedly filling up the Tokyo Dome to watch their performance Wednesday evening after a similar reception on Tuesday.\n\nThe BTS agency said the A-bomb shirt\u2019s wearing was \u201cin no way intentional\u201d and that it wasn\u2019t designed to \u201cinjure or make light of those affected by the use of atomic weapons.\u201d It said it still apologizes for \u201cfailing to take the precautions that could have prevented the wearing of such clothing by our artist.\u201d\n\nRegarding the hat furor, it said all apparel and accessories used for the photo book were provided by a media company involved in its publication. It said the flags in question were aimed at symbolizing South Korea\u2019s restrictively uniform and authoritarian educational systems, not the Nazism.\n\n\u201cWe will carefully examine and review not only these issues but all activities involving Big Hit and our artists based on a firm understanding of diverse social, historical and cultural considerations to ensure that we never cause any injury, pain or distress to anyone,\u201d the agency statement said.\n\nThe seven members of the band, which has a worldwide following, in May became the first South Korean artists to top the Billboard 200 albums chart with \u201cLove Yourself: Tear.\u201d The band began its Japan tour earlier this week.\n\nSouth Korean K-pop and movie stars are extremely popular in Japan and other Asian countries.", "SYDNEY (AP) \u2014 Regional security and the strengthening of ties with Japan and the U.S. will be high on the agenda for Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison when he meets leaders from both countries amid continuing concerns about the growing influence of China in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nMorrison will meet Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday, when Abe makes a flying visit to Darwin between a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore and the weekend\u2019s meeting of leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in Papua New Guinea. Abe will become the first Japanese leader to visit Darwin since the bombing of the northern Australian city by Japanese forces in World War II.\n\nMorrison will then hold meetings with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence during the APEC meeting in Port Moresby. Pence will use the northern Australian city of Cairns as his base for those meetings amid concerns over security in Papua New Guinea. It\u2019s expected several other APEC leaders will also stay in Cairns.\n\nTrade and investment will be a major focus of Morrison\u2019s meetings with Abe, who will use his Darwin trip to also visit Japan\u2019s biggest ever foreign investment, the $40 billion Ichthys gas project in which Japanese firm Inpex is the majority shareholder and operator. The project, which pipes offshore gas from the northwest Australian coast to Darwin, began its first shipments of liquefied natural gas to Japan last month.\n\nMorrison said he and Abe would also acknowledge those who served in World War II, in a pointed gesture in the northern port city that was bombed by Japanese forces in 1942, with the loss of 250 lives.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Abe\u2019s visit is deeply symbolic and significant and it will build on our two countries\u2019 strong and enduring friendship as well as our economic, security, community and historical ties,\u201d Morrison said in a statement.\n\nThe meeting comes at a time when a key topic for Australia, its second-largest trading partner Japan and other Asian and South Pacific neighbors is how to respond to the growing influence of China, Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner.\n\nAustralia and Japan are expected to reach agreement in Darwin to facilitate larger and more regular joint military exercises, part of a strengthening of defense and economic ties amid growing uncertainty about American involvement in Asia under the Trump administration.\n\nNegotiations began in 2014 for the Reciprocal Access Agreement, which would make it easier for Japanese and Australian forces to visit either country with equipment for military exercises.\n\nAn official from Japan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Australian Financial Review newspaper this week that the two countries were \u201cat the final stage in discussions\u201d on the agreement, set to become the first pact on visiting forces Tokyo has signed outside of its arrangement with the U.S.\n\nJapan is also expected to welcome Australia\u2019s new foreign policy shift toward the southwest Pacific announced last week. Canberra will set up a 2 billion Australian dollar ($1.4 billion) fund to support infrastructure projects in the region, which fits with Japan\u2019s call for alternative sources of investment to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nMorrison will also meet Pence in Port Moresby, where the vice president is expected to deliver a speech at the APEC CEO Summit on Saturday morning continuing Washington\u2019s push against China\u2019s growing influence. Pence is due to talk just minutes after an address to the forum by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Morrison will also address the gathering\n\nAs the U.S. trade war with China continues, Pence is expected to maintain a hard line against Beijing, following a speech he delivered last month accusing China of stealing U.S. intellectual property, meddling in American elections and suppressing human rights.\n\nPence is also expected to increase pressure on China over its militarization of the disputed South China Sea, the need to maintain pressure on North Korea to denuclearize and on the fight against terrorism.\n\nPence\u2019s press secretary Alyssa Farah said he would \u201cdeliver the message that authoritarianism, aggression, and the disregard for other nations\u2019 sovereignty by any nation in the Indo-Pacific will not be tolerated by the United States.\u201d\n\nThe vice president is also expected to set out Washington\u2019s rival vision for the Indo-Pacific, promoting private investment over state-controlled funding to build regional infrastructure, in reaction to Chinese involvement in the South Pacific in recent years.\n\nIn an opinion piece for the Washington Post last weekend, Pence wrote: \u201cThe United States will work with like-minded nations \u2014 from India to the Pacific islands \u2014 to advance our shared interests.

If the wind blows, though, it\u2019s going to be survival.\u201d\n\nMissing from the Open this year are two of Australia\u2019s top players, Jason Day, whose wife is expecting a baby, and Adam Scott. Jordan Spieth, a two-time champion, has also decided not to travel Down Under this year, and the field is one of the weakest for the tournament in years.\n\nGeoff Ogilvy, who won the Australian Open at The Lakes in 2010, was quoted as saying in Golf Australia magazine that he\u2019s disappointed the tournament, first played in 1904, isn\u2019t what it was back in the days when Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Arnold Palmer and Greg Norman were adding their names to the Stonehaven Cup.\n\nThe prize money of 1.25 million Australian dollars ($903,000) and A$225,000 ($163,000) to the winner this year can\u2019t compete with other tournaments around the world.\n\n\u201cWe are now playing the Australian Open for less money than when I turned professional two decades ago,\u201d Ogilvy said. \u201cIt was a big tournament back then. Played towards the end of the northern hemisphere summer it was surrounded by a few other big events. So players from elsewhere could bring their families and make the long trip worthwhile. It made sense.\u201d\n\nOgilvy said the increasing investment in rival tours means players and sponsor money is going elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe economic clout of the PGA Tour has done much to ruin so many events held outside the United States,\u201d Ogilvy said. \u201cOnly those in the Middle East and maybe the HSBC event in China have been able to compete financially.\u201d\n\nKuchar on Wednesday said the Australian Open\u2019s history, and not the prize money, is a reason he\u2019s in Sydney.\n\n\u201cIt adds to the allure of coming and playing and trying to put your name on that list of champions,\u201d Kuchar said. \u201cIt is a national Open ... golf\u2019s such a big part of sport and people\u2019s lives in Australia.\u201d\n\nThe Australian Open field should improve next year when it is moved to the week before the Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne.

Malik Williams also posted a career high of 17 points in the rout.\n\nAfter Nicholls State stayed close with Louisville in last week\u2019s season opener, Mack used the practices to toughen up his players in preparation for a schedule that includes eight games against teams ranked in the AP\u2019s preseason top 10. Mack saw improvement on both sides of the court as the Cardinals shot 58.2 percent and forced 23 turnovers.\n\n\u201cThe three practices that we had leading up to tonight really set the tone,\u201d he said. \u201cI really think you earn the right to win and you earn your victories in practice because that\u2019s who you become on game night.\u201d\n\nSouthern coach Sean Woods said he noticed a marked difference from the team he observed in game film.\n\n\u201cHandling pressure, making shots, executing high-low situations, so I tip my hat off to coach Mack because he\u2019s been working on getting his guys better,\u201d Woods said.\n\nOne of the players Mack wanted to see improve was Nwora.

The Jaguars finished getting whistled for 39 fouls. Three players fouled out, with four more drawing four each.\n\nLouisville: The Cardinals looked much more at ease Tuesday after struggling in their season opener.

Louisville outrebounded Southern 37-22 and enjoyed a 38-20 scoring advantage in the paint.\n\nLOCKER ROOM CLOSED\n\nPrior to the game, Louisville announced its locker room would be closed for postgame interviews, per Mack\u2019s decision. The program had been one of the few to allow locker room access during the regular season. The NCAA maintains an open locker room policy during the March tournament.\n\nAGAU RETURNS\n\nTuesday marked the return of Akoy Agau to the Cardinals. The graduate transfer from Southern Methodist played 22 games for the Cardinals before leaving the program in late 2014 to play for Georgetown.

Jeff Denham in the November election. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 First-time candidate Josh Harder defeated four-term Republican U.S. Rep. Jeff Denham Tuesday in California\u2019s farm belt, giving Democrats their fourth pickup of a GOP House seat in California.\n\nHarder, 32, a venture capitalist, had anchored his campaign to Denham\u2019s vote against the Affordable Care Act, while arguing that he would push for universal health care in Congress. He also argued that Denham and other Washington Republicans ignored poverty and health care in the agricultural 10th District in California\u2019s Central Valley.\n\n\u201cWashington is broken because our leaders have put party over country. I pledge that I will always put this community before anything in Washington,\u201d Harder said in a statement.\n\nAs ballot-counting continued, Democrats gained ground in two undecided House races in Orange County, California, raising the possibility of a Democratic sweep of four closely contested congressional races in the one-time Republican stronghold.\n\nIn the 45th District in Orange County, Democrat Katie Porter jumped into a 261-vote lead over Republican Rep. Mimi Walters, after trailing the incumbent since Election Day.\n\nAnd in the 39th District, anchored in Orange County, Democrat Gil Cisneros tightened the gap with Republican Young Kim.\n\nEarlier, Democrats claimed the seats of Republican Reps. Dana Rohrabacher in the county\u2019s 48th District and retiring Darrell Issa in the 49th District, which cuts through the southern end of the county.\n\nWith votes continuing to be counted, Harder\u2019s edge has grown after Denham grabbed a slim lead on Election Day. After the latest update, Harder had a 4,919-vote lead out of about 185,000 votes counted, a margin too large for the congressman to overcome with remaining votes.\n\nDenham\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe 51-year-old Denham had depicted Harder as a liberal, Silicon Valley insider whose values were more closely aligned with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi than a district known for producing cherries and almonds. An ad he posted on Twitter labeled Harder \u201cextreme.\u201d\n\nThe contest was one of a string of showcase battles in California in Republican districts that were targeted by Democrats after Hillary Clinton carried them in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nFor state Republicans, Denham\u2019s defeat marked another setback in a state where the party has been drifting toward irrelevance for years. Democrats hold every statewide office, a supermajority in both chambers of the Legislature and a 3.7-million advantage in voter registrations.\n\nWith Harder\u2019s win, Democrats will hold at least a 43-10 edge in California U.S. House seats.\n\nDenham had proved a durable politician in a district 80 miles (129 kilometers) east of San Francisco with a Democratic registration edge. The former legislator first elected to the House in 2010 is known for his involvement in water issues vital to agriculture. In a tilt to his district\u2019s heavy Hispanic population, he pushed Congress to consider a pathway for citizenship for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and stayed here illegally.\n\nDenham won by 3 percentage points in 2016.\n\nThe race this year attracted a torrent of campaign dollars: Harder pulled in over $6 million and Denham, $4.5 million. At least 26 outside groups spent another $10 million trying to influence the race, according to California Target Book, which analyzes campaigns.\n\nDenham attributed the close race to money pouring in from outside the district. But he became another victim in a year when Democrats regained control of the House.\n\nOther Republican incumbents in California to lose this year include Rep. Steve Knight in the 25th District, north of Los Angeles.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was a factor in the GOP losses. He lost California by over 4 million votes in 2016, and many voters saw an opportunity to send a message to Washington when they voted for Democrats.\n\nCalifornia is home to the so-called Trump \u201cresistance,\u201d which has stood in opposition to his policies on the environment and immigration.\n\nHarder, a technology investor who was born and raised in the district, said voters were looking for a check against Trump policies that have \u201cmade things worse for most people in this community.\u201d", "CARLSBAD, Calif.

(AP Photo/Tony Avelar)\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan knew things wouldn\u2019t always go quite as smoothly for Nick Mullens as they did in his first start.\n\nSo when Mullens followed up his record-setting debut with a spottier performance that included two interceptions and a failed late drive, Shanahan wasn\u2019t overly concerned and remains committed to Mullens as the starter when the team returns from the bye next week.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a positive experience,\u201d Shanahan said Tuesday. \u201cThe guy\u2019s played one game in his career. I know statistically that was the best start in NFL history. I mean, I think Nick did some real good things yesterday, too. It was a little bit more of a challenge in some circumstances. ... What I liked about Nick is he never seemed rattled throughout the whole game, continued playing. He was great after the game. He was great watching film with him. I say it\u2019s a good experience or step forward because I think he\u2019ll get better from each experience he has.\u201d\n\nJust about everything went right for Mullens in his debut against the Oakland Raiders on Nov. 1, when he joined Hall of Famers Jim Kelly and Fran Tarkenton as the only players with at least 250 yards passing, three touchdown passes and no interceptions in the first career game. He also had the most efficient debut since the merger for a player with at least 20 attempts, posting a 151.9 rating in the 34-3 win.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t quite like that in a 27-23 loss to the New York Giants on Monday night. Mullens went 27 for 39 for 250 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions.\n\nHe helped San Francisco (2-8) build a 10-point lead in the second half before the team blew it. Mullens then drove the Niners to the 21 in the closing minute before his last-ditch pass sailed out of the back of the end zone to send San Francisco to another loss.\n\nMullens\u2019 best play came in the third quarter when he went through several reads before finding running back Matt Breida for an 11-yard touchdown pass that made it 20-10.\n\nBut there were also some mistakes, like a slightly off-target pass to Marquise Goodwin that led to an interception in the second half and a late throw to Kendrick Bourne that led to an earlier pick in the first half that set up a New York touchdown.\n\n\u201cI thought he did some decent things last night,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good pocket passer, so I want him to be perfect at it. He was pretty good on a number of his reads. He had a touchdown get into the last guy in his progression. Had a couple big plays, getting into number two and three. But, I want him to be automatic. I know that\u2019s what he wants to do, too. And we\u2019ll keep working at it until he is.\u201d\n\nThe 49ers should be healthy when they return from the bye with Shanahan predicting that everyone on the roster should be available to practice next week.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Frustration, finger-pointing and questions spilled over a closed-door meeting of House Republicans Tuesday night as lawmakers sorted through an election defeat that cost them the majority and began considering new leadership for their shrunken minority.\n\nRepublicans complained about the unpopularity of the GOP tax law they blamed for losses in New York and other key states, some attendees told reporters after the meeting. Some in the meeting said Republicans should have tried harder to fulfill President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities, like funding for the border wall with Mexico. They also warned that they need a new fundraising mechanism to compete with the small-dollar online donors that powered Democrats to victory.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little rawness still,\u201d Rep. Mark Walker, R-S.C., who is running unopposed for a down-ballot position as vice chair of the GOP conference, told reporters outside the meeting room. \u201cBut there\u2019s an opportunity for us to come together and get single-focused on the message.\u201d\n\nWith the speaker\u2019s gavel now out of reach, GOP Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump ally, is poised to take over as minority leader. But the Californian has struggled in the past to build support from conservatives. He faces a longshot challenge from Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus who has support from outside conservative groups and got a second-look during a nearly two-hour candidate forum Tuesday.\n\nTrump has stayed largely on the sidelines ahead of closed-door elections Wednesday that will determine party leadership not only for House Republicans, but also for Senate Democrats and Republicans, and set the tone for the new Congress. Voting for the biggest race, Rep. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s bid to return as the Democrats\u2019 nominee for speaker, is later this month.\n\nJordan told reporters that he made a pitch to his colleagues at a sometimes-tense session in the Capitol basement based on three questions: \u201cWhy\u2019d we lose, how do we get it back and what we\u2019re up against.\u201d\n\nThe former college wrestling champ said he told Republicans they need a fighter to confront Pelosi and her new majority.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re entering a world we haven\u2019t really seen,\u201d he said, rattling off the names of the Democratic chairmen who are poised to investigate Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take an attitude and an intensity about standing up for the truth and fighting.\u201d\n\nMost GOP lawmakers, though, prefer McCarthy\u2019s more affable approach, and he remained favored to win Wednesday. Accompanied by his wife, McCarthy entered the meeting room, telling reporters, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a plan.\u201d\n\nGOP Whip Steve Scalise, the Louisiana Republican who was gravely wounded in last year\u2019s congressional baseball practice shooting and is running unopposed for another term in leadership, said McCarthy \u201cknows what he needs to do\u201d to win over his colleagues \u2014 and win back the majority \u2014 and is well-positioned to do both.\n\n\u201cYou always look in the mirror and see what you can do better,\u201d Scalise said as he entered the room. Republicans, he said, \u201cneed to do a better job of letting people know what we stand for.\u201d\n\nRounding out the GOP leadership team will be Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who wants to bring a more aggressive stance to the GOP\u2019s communications and messaging strategy in the No. 3 spot.\n\nIn the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is expected to win another term, but the most interesting race is for the No. 5 spot, where Republicans are poised to elect their first woman to leadership in almost a decade, as they try to smooth the optics of a GOP side that\u2019s dominated by men.\n\nNebraska Sen. Deb Fischer has made a bid for that spot \u201cto help bring our party\u2019s big tent together.\u201d She faces GOP Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa.\n\nThe rest of the GOP line-up is expected to shuffle slightly. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the GOP whip, is being forced out by term limits. That allows Sen. John Thune of South Dakota to move up to the No. 2 spot. Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming and Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri take over the third- and fourth-ranking spots.\n\nSenate Democrats are keeping their team headed by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, even though one of the two new Democratic senators-elect, Krysten Sinema of Arizona, has said she wouldn\u2019t vote for him.\n\nNewly elected Republicans will cast their first votes during closed-door meetings Wednesday even before they\u2019re sworn into office as part of the new Congress in January.\n\nDan Meuser, a new Republican from Pennsylvania, said he\u2019s talked with both McCarthy and Jordan in recent days about their plans for the new minority and has been giving his vote \u201ca lot of thought.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say I have not made a decision yet,\u201d said Meuser at freshman orientation. He said he\u2019s \u201cgotten close with Kevin McCarthy. I think very highly of him. I think he\u2019s a very good conservative, he\u2019s showed a lot of leadership. He\u2019s certainly earned the position. On the same note, I think Jim Jordan\u2019s a smart, tough, focused individual. So I respect him as well. So, yeah, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nAnd some just want to avoid more infighting as Republicans return to the minority for the first time in eight years.\n\n\u201cWhoever loses needs to get behind whoever wins,\u201d said Rep.

(AP Photo/Alex Gallardo)\n\nRENTON, Wash. (AP) \u2014 For most of his career, the fourth quarter is where Russell Wilson has thrived. His late game heroics of leading comebacks in the fourth quarter or overtime to win games take up nearly an entire page of Seattle\u2019s weekly game notes.\n\nExcept this year, when the fourth-quarter mistakes by Wilson have overshadowed his late-game successes. And those mistakes are part of the reason Seattle is 4-5 and faces such a critical game on Thursday night against Green Bay in the quest to stay in the NFC playoff conversation.\n\nSeattle is 1-8 in its last nine games decided by one score or less. Over the past two seasons, Seattle is 5-11 in one-score games. They used to be the types of games in which Seattle thrived, with Wilson finding a way to score and pull out a victory in the closing minutes, or defensively making the necessary stops to stem any late rally by an opponent.\n\nBut that page in Seattle\u2019s game notes detailing his 24 comebacks in the fourth quarter and overtime has just three entries over the past two seasons.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two things there. It goes back to finishing right. If we can make one or two plays here or there across the board \u2014 offensive, defensive, special teams, whatever it may be \u2014 we can turn that around really easily. That\u2019s the great thing,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThe second thing is ... we\u2019re in every game and every game is really close and every game we\u2019re right there to win the game. I\u2019m looking forward to that turning around. We have great confidence in that and what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubting that in stretches this season Wilson has played great. He\u2019s thrown for 14 touchdowns with just two interceptions over the past five games. And the success or failure of Seattle in the fourth quarter is not solely his responsibility.\n\nBut there\u2019s also been a pattern of crucial late-game mistakes by Wilson that has been a contributing factor to each of Seattle\u2019s five losses.\n\n\u2014 In a Week 1 loss at Denver, Seattle gained seven yards on its final three drives and Wilson threw an interception on a desperation throw on the final play of a 27-24 loss.\n\n\u2014 In Week 2 at Chicago, Wilson threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown with the Seahawks trailing 17-10, and on Seattle\u2019s next drive fumbled while being sacked. Seattle lost 24-17\n\n\u2014 In Week 5 against the Rams, Wilson missed on his final two passes with Seattle closing in on field goal range while down by two points with less than 4 minutes left. Seattle punted and never got the ball back in a 33-31 loss.\n\n\u2014 In Week 9, Wilson threw his second fourth-quarter interception that was returned for a touchdown when Desmond King stepped in front of a pass and the pick-six ended up being the deciding points in the Chargers\u2019 25-17 win.\n\n\u2014 And last week, Wilson was stripped by Dante Fowler midway through the fourth quarter deep in Seattle\u2019s end. Brandin Cooks\u2019 TD run on the next play ended up being the deciding points in the Rams\u2019 36-31 win.\n\nThe only one-score game the Seahawks have won this season was arguably one of its uglier performances when Sebastian Janikowski kicked a 52-yard field goal on the final play to beat Arizona in Week 4. And while several of those games have seen Wilson rebound from his mistakes to give Seattle a chance in the closing seconds, the final results are not what the Seahawks have come to expect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s finishing at the right time, making the right play. We\u2019ve been so good at those games for such a long time that the fact that it\u2019s not happening is a little bit unusual,\u201d Seattle coach Pete Carroll said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed because we\u2019ve been able to always feel like we\u2019re going to win those games and do it. We still have the same mentality about it and attitude about it, but we\u2019ve got to show it. We\u2019ve got to get those finishes done.\u201d\n\nNOTES: LB K.J.

His factory churns out tons of cookies, crackers, candies and bakery goods, plus dozens of varieties of soft drinks sold around the country.

His announcement in April that North Korea had sufficiently developed its nuclear weapons and would now focus on building its economy marked a sharp turn in official policy, setting the stage for his rapid-fire meetings with the leaders of China, South Korea and the United States.\n\nIt also set in motion an ambitious campaign of \u201con-the-spot guidance\u201d trips to rally party officials, factory managers and military troops.\n\nAfter the announcement of the \u201cnew strategic line\u201d and his first round of summits, including his meeting in June with President Donald Trump, Kim embarked on nearly 20 inspection tours around the country in July and another 10 in August, all but one of them to non-military locations. The military inspection rounds are instead being handled by the country\u2019s premier, Pak Pong Ju, who has gone on 18 inspection tours from July, mostly to military facilities.\n\nOn-the-spot guidance tours are a tradition Kim inherited from his father and grandfather, the late \u201ceternal General-Secretary\u201d Kim Jong Il and \u201ceternal President\u201d Kim Il Sung.\n\nThey date to the late 1940s, when Kim Il Sung began gradually institutionalizing the visits to demonstrate his hands-on leadership and, as invariably portrayed by the North\u2019s media, his deep care and concern for the well-being of the people.\n\nFactories, farms and important industrial facilities are the usual destinations. But Kim Jong Un\u2019s focus on them this year marks a break from excursions in 2017 to nuclear weapons facilities and missile sites.\n\nReflecting the gravity of his current mission, Kim has shown little patience for cadres who come up short.\n\nOn his July tour in the northern part of the country he lambasted officials at a factory that produces backpacks for students, saying their attitude was \u201cvery wrong\u201d and \u201chas no revolutionary spirit.\u201d He then dressed down officials at a power plant that has been under construction for 17 years, criticized people in charge of a hotel project for taking too long to finish plastering its walls and slammed the authorities responsible for building a recreational campsite.\n\n\u201cLooking round the bathroom of the camp, he pointed out its very bad condition, saying bathtubs for hot spring therapy are dirty, gloomy and unsanitary for their poor management,\u201d said an official report of the visit.\n\n___\n\nMost inspection tours, however, go like Kim\u2019s two-hour visit to the Songdowon processed foods factory.\n\nWith a gaggle of cameramen in tow \u2014 the tours are always top news in North Korea\u2019s media \u2014 the site\u2019s senior manager generally serves as the guide. Members of Kim\u2019s entourage frantically take notes as he suggests tweaks of this or that and offers praise or encouragement.\n\nMany factories put up red and gold plaques to commemorate the event. Some have special wall displays made afterward that show the exact path the leader took in little LED lights that can be turned on at the press of a button.\n\nAt Kwon\u2019s factory, which has 300 employees and is located on the outskirts of the eastern coastal city of Wonsan, Kim advised managers to improve operations on an \u201cautomated, unmanned and germ-free basis, holding aloft the banner of self-reliance.\u201d\n\nBefore the obligatory group photo session, the North\u2019s official news agency reported, Kim voiced \u201chis expectation and conviction\u201d the factory would produce more quality foods \u201cand thus more fully demonstrate the honor of being a factory loved by the people.\u201d\n\nBut Kim also had a broader point to make.\n\nHe told the factory management that they must be prepared to work in a more competitive environment, to modernize and cut the fat. These are special times and they, and basically all managers throughout the country, need to step up their game.\n\n\u201cThe Respected Marshal Kim Jong Un pays much more attention to the quality of a product,\u201d Kwon said. \u201cWhen he came to this factory he gave instructions to maintain a high level of hygiene because food is closely associated with the health of the people, and to keep the highest level of quality of products that people like.

A solid 70 percent of Americans plan to shop on Black Friday this year, according to a recent NerdWallet study conducted by The Harris Poll. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File)\n\nA solid 70 percent of Americans plan to shop on Black Friday this year, according to a recent NerdWallet study conducted by The Harris Poll.\n\nBut the nature of a day centered around shopping can almost inevitably lead to overspending.\n\nHere are three ways to tell whether participating in Black Friday is really right \u2014 or actually wrong \u2014 for you.\n\nCONSIDER WHAT YOU\u2019RE BUYING\n\nBlack Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, is known for long lines, big crowds and low prices.\n\nAnd while the shopping holiday often does deliver unbeatable deals on things like electronics, certain items are cheaper at other times of the year.\n\nClothing is generally a bargain on Black Friday, but some clothing reaches its lowest price off-season, according to Charlie Graham, founder and CEO of Shop It to Me, a sale alert app.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re really penny-pinching, you can find better deals when items go on clearance outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday,\u201d Graham says of some apparel.\n\nThink buying swimsuits at the end of winter or sweaters in the middle of summer.\n\nTIP: Consider the items you want this Black Friday and write them down. Then, check Black Friday ads to see if those products will be on sale. Retailers usually release their ads ahead of time \u2014 online, by email or in the mail. If you don\u2019t see what you want at the price you want, think about waiting to buy.\n\nCONSIDER WHY YOU\u2019RE BUYING\n\nOf those who plan to shop in stores this Black Friday, 42 percent said they plan to do so because they enjoy the in-store hype (e.g., doorbuster deals, camping outside of stores the night before), according to the NerdWallet study.\n\nEnjoying this annual tradition is one thing, but going shopping \u201cjust because\u201d isn\u2019t always a good idea. Even if you\u2019ve set a budget before putting on your comfiest sneakers and standing in the cold, you may be susceptible to making additional purchases once you\u2019re among the merchandise.\n\nOn Black Friday, retailers compete for a share of your wallet, says Jeff Inman, a marketing professor at the University of Pittsburgh and editor-in-chief of the Journal of Consumer Research.\n\nTraditionally, retailers draw in Black Friday shoppers with a few great deals \u2014 called \u201closs leaders\u201d \u2014 and hope they\u2019ll buy additional items as well. Imagine going for a TV and leaving with clothing and Christmas decorations, too.\n\nWhile Inman says he hasn\u2019t always seen shoppers with huge baskets on Black Friday, he does point to toys as one category where shoppers may spring for something even if they didn\u2019t see it in a Black Friday ad.\n\nFor example, while in the store, you may come across a toy and decide to buy it for your niece for Christmas. This isn\u2019t necessarily an impulse purchase; you already planned to buy a gift for your niece. But since you didn\u2019t know the exact item you wanted to buy, he calls selecting this toy an \u201cimpulse allocation\u201d of your holiday shopping budget.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a problem if you can afford it, but be conscious of this possibility when you step foot in the store.\n\nTIP: Think about why you want to shop on Black Friday, and whether you\u2019re financially prepared. If you\u2019re not sure you can resist the temptation to overshoot your budget, consider skipping.\n\nCONSIDER WHEN YOU\u2019RE BUYING\n\nFinally, plan your timing. With deals launching earlier each year, some Black Friday sales really happen the whole week of Thanksgiving, according to Graham from Shop It to Me.\n\n\u201cTo compete with each other, the retailers have been pushing their sales earlier and earlier during that week,\u201d Graham says.\n\nBecause of this, sometimes shoppers can get Black Friday-level prices before Black Friday.\n\nTIP: Although this might not be true for every product category, monitor sales in the days leading up to Black Friday for an early shot at a good deal.\n\nTO STAY OR TO GO?\n\nOnce you decide the what, why and when of your Black Friday shopping, you\u2019ll be able to decide whether you should join the crowds or stay on the couch.\n\n___________________________________\n\nThis article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

But after winning power a year ago, liberal Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern promised her government would re-examine the issue.\n\n\u201cTo the Pike River families, to New Zealand: We are returning,\u201d said Little.\n\nAnna Osborne, whose husband Milton Osborne was killed in the explosion, said it was a victory for the \u201clittle people\u201d of New Zealand. She said that for the men who were killed, the families couldn\u2019t just let things lie.\n\n\u201cWe needed to fight,\u201d she told media on Wednesday. \u201cWe need to bring our men home if we can. We need answers to questions that we don\u2019t have. We need the unexplored crime scene investigated. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nDinghy Pattinson, the chief operating officer for the Pike River Recovery Agency, told The Associated Press that the mine remains filled with about 96 percent methane gas.\n\nHe said the plan is to add some bore holes and gradually pump in nitrogen gas to replace the methane as it rises and dissipates into the atmosphere. The nitrogen will then be replaced by air before crews can safely re-enter the mine by about February, he said.\n\nBut the plan won\u2019t allow access into the inner workings of the mine, which remain blocked by a massive rockfall.\n\nNew Zealand Police say they\u2019ll be examining any new evidence from the mine, which they could use to file charges.\n\nAn earlier investigation concluded the Pike River Coal company had exposed miners to unacceptable risks as it strove to meet financial targets. The report found the company ignored 21 warnings that methane gas had accumulated to explosive levels before the disaster.\n\nThe company, which went bankrupt, didn\u2019t contest labor violation charges against it.\n\nFormer chief executive Peter Whittall also faced labor charges but they were dismissed after he and the company made a financial settlement, a development which angered many of the grieving families. New Zealand\u2019s Supreme Court later ruled the settlement was unlawful.\n\nAny new evidence revealed by re-entering the mine could be used in a new case against him.", "ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 A driver was injured and two dogs in a sled dog team were hurt in a collision near Wasilla.\n\nAnchorage television station KTVA reports a crash between an SUV and a pickup sent the truck into a dog team being trained by Iditarod musher Kristy Berington.\n\nBerington was training dogs belonging to musher Tom Knolmayer, who was ahead of her with other dogs.\n\nAlaska State Troopers say the sport utility vehicle rear-ended a pickup.

Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round draft pick were acquired in a trade with the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton. (Aaron Lavinsky/Star Tribune via AP)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 When Robert Covington, Dario Saric and Jerryd Bayless walked into their hotel rooms in Minnesota, they found appropriate gifts from Timberwolves All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns: winter coats.\n\nAfter the overnight temperature dropped to 7 degrees, the newest members of the team by way of the Jimmy Butler trade with Philadelphia appreciated the welcome from Minnesota\u2019s best player. Butler\u2019s awkward and drawn-out departure created an icy atmosphere around the organization, but now that the deal is finally done, the Wolves have begun trying to warm the atmosphere back up.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait to get on the court, put on that jersey and put it on for this city,\u201d Covington said at a news conference inside Target Center on Tuesday afternoon that carried just a bit less buzz than Butler\u2019s open-to-the-public introduction at the Mall of America less than 17 months ago.\n\nAs Butler formally joined the 76ers , the Wolves pivoted forward after a pressure-relieving win over Brooklyn on Monday night following an 0-5 road trip.\n\nNeither Covington nor Saric played against the Nets, but they\u2019re on track to take the floor on Wednesday night against New Orleans. Bayless is injured, rehabilitating a hyperextended right knee, and with a glut of point guards on the roster he\u2019s not expected to see playing time even once he\u2019s healthy. Both Covington and Saric were starters for the Sixers, who finished third in the Eastern Conference last season at 52-30.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re both young, and they\u2019re going to get better. Both are very good defensively. They both shoot the 3. We think they fit well with the guys that we do have,\u201d said president of basketball operations and coach Tom Thibodeau. \u201cOnce we got to that point where we felt we were getting multiple rotational players, then we felt it would be time to execute the deal. When we initially started off, that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d\n\nAs for whether the Timberwolves could be better without Butler, the four-time All-Star with exceptional ability on both ends on the court, Thibodeau demurred.\n\n\u201cWe have to focus on who\u2019s here. We think we have a good, young nucleus, and we have to build off of that,\u201d Thibodeau said.\n\nCovington is the centerpiece of the package.\n\nThe 27-year-old, who went undrafted out of Tennessee State and began in the NBA with Houston in the 2013-14 season, has career averages of 12.6 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game with a 35.9 shooting percentage from 3-point range. The 6-foot-9 Covington was an All-Defensive First Team pick last season with a career-most 315 deflections and a defensive rating of 99.0 that led all forwards in the league with at least 30 minutes per game. He was ninth in the NBA in steals with an average of 1.7 per game.\n\nThat\u2019s the area where he\u2019ll help the Timberwolves the most, the area that Butler was also acquired to help improve.\n\n\u201cIn order to stay in this league and be effective, you\u2019ve got to be able to go down there and be able to stop somebody on the other end,\u201d Covington said, adding: \u201cI think I watched more film the first few years than I\u2019ve ever watched my entire life, as far as just different guys and watching how they read certain things and build the habits of watching players and everything. So I\u2019d say the past couple seasons is when everything started to click.\u201d\n\nThe 24-year-old Saric was named to the All-Rookie First Team in 2016-17. The native of Croatia has career averages of 13.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game. He shot 39.3 percent from 3-point range last season.\n\nCovington will likely fill Butler\u2019s starting spot. Thibodeau could move Taj Gibson to the second unit and keep Saric as a starter. The 6-foot-10 Saric, who was the 12th overall pick in the 2014 draft, is the classic \u201cstretch four\u201d with a power forward\u2019s size and a small forward\u2019s shot. He meshed well with Sixers center Joel Embiid, so Towns has the potential to similarly complement his game.\n\n\u201cKAT is shooting so much better from the 3-point line than Joel, and it seems like we can play with each other,\u201d Saric said, adding: \u201cIf I find a way how to play with Joel, I think I can find a way how to play with KAT.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "PROVO, Utah (AP) \u2014 Asha Thomas scored 17 points, Kristine Anigwe had 16 points and 12 rebounds, two days after her 20-20 game, and No. 23 California used a big fourth quarter to beat BYU 70-52 on Tuesday night.\n\nCal trailed 25-24 at halftime, but opened the second half on a 12-2 run \u2014 with six points from Anigwe.

(AP Photo/Matt Ludtke)\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Running back Aaron Jones\u2019 breakout game led to a breakthrough performance in the red zone for the Green Bay Packers.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s 31-12 victory over the Miami Dolphins, Jones rushed for a career-high 145 yards and two touchdowns. With Jones taking some of the pressure off quarterback Aaron Rodgers, the Packers scored four touchdowns in four possessions inside the Dolphins 20-yard line.\n\nIt was Green Bay\u2019s first perfect day with more than one red-zone possession since Week 4 of the 2017 season.\n\n\u201cYou saw it the other night,\u201d Rodgers said on Tuesday. \u201cRunning the football in the red zone has not been a high priority for us, but the abilities that he brings slashing inside can give us some opportunities to run some more of those plays in the red zone.\u201d\n\nTheir next test comes on Thursday night on the road against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nSituational football \u2014 red zone and third down \u2014 has been troublesome for Green Bay\u2019s offense all season. Before the Miami game, the Packers ranked sixth in total offense (406.6 yards per game), but were only 14th in scoring (24.0 points per game) because of inconsistencies on third down (17th, 39.4 percent conversion rate) and the red zone (19th, 53.9 percent touchdowns).\n\nAgainst the Dolphins, they gained 377 yards but scored 31 points, thanks in large part to their success in the red zone.\n\nThe threat of the running game gives the Packers (4-4-1) another option as they advance toward the goal line.\n\nWhile Jones scored on runs of 2 and 10 yards, Rodgers threw touchdown passes of 7 and 25 yards to receiver Davante Adams to punctuate the other two red zone possessions. Adams is tied for second in the NFL with nine touchdown receptions. Of those, a league-high eight have come in the red zone. Since the start of the 2016 season, Adams has a league-high 22 red zone touchdown receptions.\n\nThe closer to the goal line, the less space there is to operate and the more difficult it becomes to throw. Adams\u2019 edge comes from being one of the NFL\u2019s premier route runners.\n\n\u201cBecause the window is so tight, and he can create enough separation to where he makes that window bigger,\u201d Rodgers said.\n\nWith the emergence of Jones, the Packers have another weapon to use in their push for a playoff spot in the crowded NFC. Jones missed the first two games of the season with a suspension, then was part of a three-man committee in the backfield before taking over as the starter.\n\nIn the three weeks since the bye, Jones has carried 41 times, Jamaal Williams has carried 14 times and Ty Montgomery was traded to the Ravens.\n\n\u201cThe more carries you get, I feel like the better you\u2019re going to get and the more of a game flow you get in,\u201d Jones said.\n\nEntering Thursday, Jones and Williams both have 73 carries. Jones, however, has rushed for 494 yards (compared to 270 for Williams) on a league-best 6.8-yard average. Jones had a 67-yard run in the first quarter against Miami, the team\u2019s longest since receiver Randall Cobb had a 67-yard run in 2013.\n\nWith Jones\u2019 emergence to join Rodgers and Adams, the Packers hope they have the firepower for back-to-back road tests against Seattle and Minnesota.\n\n\u201cIt puts the defense in a bind,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt puts them to where they\u2019ve got to load up that box and it allows us to have more opportunities outside. If they keep moving the ball like that and slashing and making big plays, it\u2019s pretty tough to figure out what to defend.\u201d\n\nNOTES: The Packers held what coach Mike McCarthy described as a \u201cvery limited\u201d practice on Tuesday before departing for Seattle in the evening. WR Randall Cobb (hamstring), CB Kevin King (hamstring), S Kentrell Brice (ankle), OLB Nick Perry (knee) were not traveling with the team, though the Packers said their game status would be updated on the final injury report on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev.

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio)\n\nEAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Mark Dantonio often shies away from talking about injuries. This year, the topic is unavoidable.\n\nThe question is whether Michigan State\u2019s offensive woes can be blamed mostly on poor health \u2014 or if there are deeper problems the Spartans need to resolve.\n\n\u201cObviously we\u2019re playing very well on the defensive side of the ball,\u201d Dantonio said Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get better on the offensive side of the ball, but that\u2019s where really all of our injuries have occurred.\u201d\n\nAfter a 26-6 loss to Ohio State last weekend, Michigan State is 13th in the Big Ten in total offense. It\u2019s been a disappointing showing for a unit that returned almost every starter from a year ago, and as the Spartans wrap up a fairly pedestrian season, Dantonio faces the tricky task of evaluating an offense that has been a weak link but is nowhere near full strength.\n\n\u201cThis year I would say it\u2019s the injuries. It\u2019s always something; every year you\u2019re going to deal with something,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cA lot of things are predicated in how your quarterback plays. That\u2019s college football. That\u2019s pro football. That\u2019s high school football. If your quarterback is playing well, you\u2019re going to be successful, usually.\u201d\n\nMichigan State (6-4) expected a lot from quarterback Brian Lewerke this year, but he has dealt with a shoulder injury and has been splitting time lately with backup Rocky Lombardi. Running back LJ Scott hurt an ankle and is now redshirting .\n\nFelton Davis was lost for the year with an Achilles tendon injury, and fellow receivers Cody White, Darrell Stewart and Jalen Nailor have missed time, too. The offensive line has also been weakened by injuries.\n\nThe problem for Michigan State \u2014 looking ahead to next year \u2014 is that it\u2019s hard to tell how much the injuries are holding the Spartans back. There\u2019s some evidence that the offense has been in decline for a while. Michigan State averaged 43 points a game and finished second in the Big Ten in total offense in 2014, but the Spartans haven\u2019t been close to that level since.\n\nIn the three seasons following that 2014 campaign, Michigan State was sixth, sixth and eighth in the league in total offense. The Spartans have dropped even further this year.\n\nMichigan State has been particularly bad on third down this season. The Spartans have converted just 30 percent of the time, one of the worst marks in the FBS.\n\n\u201cWe just haven\u2019t been able to get the completions we needed, and we\u2019ve been in some tough situations, especially some tough field position,\u201d tight end Matt Sokol said. \u201cJust comes down to execution, and all of us just coming together.\u201d\n\nMichigan State takes a good deal of pride in the continuity of its staff. Defensive coordinator Mike Tressel and co-offensive coordinator Dave Warner have been with the Spartans for Dantonio\u2019s whole 12-season tenure as coach.\n\nBut as the offense sputters, Warner in particular is under scrutiny. Right now, the Spartans are still hoping to win their last two regular-season games and go to the best bowl they can, but the offseason isn\u2019t far off. That\u2019s when Dantonio will show \u2014 through his words and actions \u2014 how much of Michigan State\u2019s struggles he felt could have been avoided.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost four football games. I feel like we\u2019ve had a chance to win every one of those. So it\u2019s more than just about injuries that we didn\u2019t win those games,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cIt\u2019s coaching decisions, it\u2019s head coaching decisions, it\u2019s players that are playing, you know, breakdowns or the ability to execute. It\u2019s the execution of the people we\u2019re playing against, that they do a good job. So, so many things you look at there. We\u2019re going to keep getting better and keep pushing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister", "MILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 An inmate has pleaded guilty to federal charges that he mailed threats to a Jewish Community Center in suburban Milwaukee.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice says 33-year-old Chadwick Grubbs pleaded guilty Tuesday.

The committee has already twice sent teams that did not reach their conference title games to the playoff. Last year it was Alabama and the year before, Ohio State got there.\n\nIn Ohio State\u2019s case, the body-of-work argument was strong enough to overcome being bumped from the Big Ten title chase by Penn State, a team the Buckeyes had lost to in a close game at Happy Valley. Last year, Alabama seemed like a default pick at 11-1 over Ohio State and USC. Both were 11-2 with conference titles, but ugly losses on their ledgers.\n\nCould the committee squeeze in the Tide after a loss to Georgia, which would obviously get in, if Clemson, Notre Dame and Michigan (and maybe even Oklahoma) all won out? It\u2019s not as if Alabama would have a loaded resume, with victories against LSU, Mississippi State and Auburn at the top. But there is also little doubt Alabama would be favored on a neutral field against any team in the country.\n\nThe committee has to be rooting for the Tide to keep it out of this mess.\n\n2. Ohio State beats Michigan and wins the Big Ten.\n\nBig 12 fans will disagree, but Michigan at 12-1 looks like a good bet to sail into the playoff \u2014 especially if Notre Dame finishes unbeaten, therefore making the Wolverines\u2019 only loss a one-score game in the opener at South Bend. The Buckeyes have nice road victories against Penn State and Michigan State. Add Michigan and Northwestern in the Big Ten championship game to that resume, and suddenly a season of struggles in Columbus, Ohio, won\u2019t look so bad at all. The stain of that blowout loss at Purdue won\u2019t come off easy, though, and choosing between Ohio State at 12-1 and Oklahoma at 12-1 or West Virginia at 11-1 or Washington State at 12-1 won\u2019t be such an easy chore for the committee.\n\n3. Notre Dame loses, especially to Southern California.\n\nAny loss for the Irish looks problematic if the rest of the contenders win out. Michigan could help Notre Dame by finishing 12-1. The Irish could make the case the committee can\u2019t put the Wolverines in and leave out the one team that beat them. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you the Irish are out with one loss. That\u2019s shortsighted and doesn\u2019t take into account that Big 12 contenders Oklahoma and West Virginia and Washington State could easily pick up a second loss before they even reach their conference title games.\n\nStill, the Irish at 11-1 pits them against any other once-beaten conference champion, while also possibly forcing the committee to justify putting Michigan in and leaving the Irish out. And if Notre Dame\u2019s loss is to USC, it could put a spotlight on Washington State\u2019s poorly officiated loss to the Trojans back in September by virtue of comparing common opponents.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

Anderson\u2019s frustration with his smaller-than-expected role on offense contributed to the team\u2019s decision to release the former 1,000-yard rusher midway through the season.\n\nRivera said he spoke recently to Anderson and could sense the veteran running back\u2019s frustration over not being more involved in Carolina\u2019s offense.\n\nChristian McCaffrey is the team\u2019s starter and rarely leaves the field, playing in 96 percent of his team\u2019s offensive snaps \u2014 by far the most of any running back in the league.\n\nMost of Anderson\u2019s reps have come in a shared backfield set with McCaffrey the Panthers called \u201cPony 21.\u201d Anderson has carried the ball just 24 times and caught one pass this season. The limited role came just one season after Anderson ran for 1,007 yards for the Broncos.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a veteran guy who has had a lot of success in this league and was just looking for more opportunities,\u201d Rivera said Tuesday, one day after the Panthers released Anderson. \u201cYou could feel\u201d the frustration.\n\nRivera reiterated what general manager Marty Hurney said Monday \u2014 that Anderson did not ask to be released from the Panthers (6-3), who visit the Lions on Sunday after a 52-21 shellacking at the hands of the Steelers last week.\n\nAnderson tweeted Monday: \u201cNo love lost. Thank you Carolina. Grind time.\u201d\n\nRivera said Cameron Artis-Payne will take over Anderson\u2019s role as the No. 2 back in Carolina.\n\nArtis-Payne was a fifth-round pick in 2015, but has played in just 25 games and carried the ball only 99 times during his career for 422 yards with four touchdowns.\n\nRivera believes Artis-Payne, who has only been active for two games this season, has a similar skillset to Anderson and can also come in and spell McCaffrey during games. Carolina also signed veteran running back Travaris Cadet, a player Rivera views as similar in style to McCaffrey as a backup plan.\n\nRivera called Artis-Payne \u201ca tough, hard-nosed young man\u201d who has gone about his role the right way in practice despite not seeing much playing time.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s waited for his opportunity and earned this opportunity, and hopefully when he gets his chance on the football field he will take advantage of it,\u201d Rivera said.\n\nRivera said the Panthers offense evolved this year under first-year offensive coordinator Norv Turner, and that things began to focus around McCaffrey as the primary, if not exclusive, back on offense \u2014 similar to how Turner extensively used LaDainian Tomlinson when he coached the San Diego Chargers.\n\nMcCaffrey\u2019s expanded role isn\u2019t a huge surprise.\n\nRivera said before the season that getting the second-year back 25 to 30 touches per game would be \u201cideal,\u201d although few could have imagined that he\u2019d leave the field as infrequently as he has this season.\n\n\u201cThe more Norv got to know who Christian is, the more we saw we could keep him on the field,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cA lot of things that we can do are structured around his skillset.\u201d\n\nMcCaffrey leads the Panthers with 579 yards rushing, followed by Cam Newton with 352 yards and wide receiver D.J. Moore with 122.\n\nAnderson, who had been expected to be used as a short-yardage back, had 104 yards rushing and no touchdowns on the ground in nine games. His lone reception went for a 24-yard touchdown.\n\nMcCaffrey said Anderson\u2019s release was a reminder the game is a business.\n\n\u201cOur coaches have a lot of confidence in the guys that are here right now and they had to make a decision they felt was best for the team,\u201d McCaffrey said. \u201cAs far as we are concerned we have to focus on the guys here and wish him the very best.

(AP) \u2014 After five straight weeks of preparing and coming up empty, the New York Giants have something to smile about starting off a week.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing what a win can do for a team.\n\n\u201cAnytime you win, it kind of verifies that what you\u2019re doing is right,\u201d coach Pat Shurmur said Tuesday, less than 24 hours after the Giants (2-7) rallied late to snap a five-game losing streak with a 27-23 win over the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n\u201cThe reason we all started playing and coaching football is because we love the competition, we love the physical nature of the game, and we love the process of getting ready to play the next opponent,\u201d Shurmur added.\n\n\u201cThen on game day, you put all your energy into winning, all your energy into putting a winning performance on the field, and so I sensed real joy in the locker room yesterday \u2014 a bunch of guys that put a lot into it, and we were able to overcome some adversity and win a football game.\u201d\n\nThe goal now for the Giants is to try to put a couple of wins together. They haven\u2019t done that since December 2016. They have a 5-20 record in their past 25 games.\n\nThe difference Monday night against the 49ers was the Giants made plays. Eli Manning threw three touchdowns and engineered a late drive capped by a short touchdown pass to Sterling Shepard.\n\nThe offensive line, aided by the addition of newcomer Jamon Brown at right guard, allowed only one sack and the defense got two interceptions from linebacker B.J. Goodson.\n\nSpecial teams also contributed as Aldrick Rosas kicked two field goals and Corey Coleman had three kickoff returns for 92 yards.\n\nThe performance by Manning was excellent. There have been many calling for the 37-year-old to be benched with the team losing again. The two-time Super Bowl MVP answered the critics.\n\n\u201cAny time a player puts a winning performance on the field, he should feel good about it at least for a day or so,\u201d Shurmur said. \u201cThe challenge is to then prepare to do it again in a week, so I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a question for him, but he had a winning performance, he helped us win a game, and he should feel good about that. Now we just have to build on that going into Tampa.\u201d\n\nThe Giants will play host to the Buccaneers in their bid for their first win of the season at home (0-4).\n\nWhile the Giants\u2019 chances of making the playoffs remain dim, Shurmur likes the team that has been assembled in his first season.\n\n\u201cThis is a really good locker room \u2014 we\u2019re young, we\u2019re new, but these guys believe in each other and try to play the game for each other,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they were loose, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right term, but I thought they were just out there playing hard and having fun playing football.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Shurmur said the Giants had the usual wear and tear in the game, but he expects no one to miss Sunday. ... Brown played very well considering he had been with the team only a week. ... Shurmur also said rookie linebacker Lorenzo Carter had his best game in both the pass rush and coverage. ... Saquon Barkley had 20 carries for 67 yards and caught four passes for 33 yards. It was the eighth time in nine games Barkley had at least 100 scrimmage yards. \u201cIf we\u2019re just going to talk about Saquon and his involvement in the game, whether we hand it to him or throw it to him, it really doesn\u2019t matter.

A 2017 federal law provided a framework for police to use rapid DNA technology when booking suspects in criminal investigations, and some medical examiners have started using it to identify the dead or are weighing deploying it in disasters.\n\n\u201cIn many circumstances, without rapid DNA technology, it\u2019s just such a lengthy process,\u201d says Frank DePaolo, a deputy commissioner of the New York City medical examiners\u2019 office, which has been at the forefront of the science of identifying human remains since 9/11 and is exploring how it might use a rapid DNA device.\n\nThe technology, and DNA itself, has limits. It is sometimes impossible to extract DNA from incinerated remains, and trying to identify remains through DNA requires having a sample from the person when alive or building a profile by sampling close relatives.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no hope of identifying the dead without DNA.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two ways to approach it: You could do a DNA-led identification effort ... (or) more traditionally, the medical examiner and their team of people will try to establish the biological profiles of the unidentified and try to identify them through more traditional methods,\u201d says Dr. Anthony Falsetti, a George Mason University forensic science professor and forensic anthropologist and a specialist in evaluating human remains.\n\nIn fact, more traditional methods, such as examining dental records, are often a first step. Partially, that\u2019s because victims might have dental X-rays but not personal DNA profiles. Other medical records \u2014 of bone fractures, prosthetics or implants, for instance \u2014 also can be helpful.\n\nAnd after a disaster, a crucial part of identifying victims is developing a manifest of the missing people, studying the site for clues as to who might have been there and meticulously searching for remains, sometimes by having a forensic anthropologist sift carefully through the debris, DePaolo said.\n\n\u201cUltimately, you may be able to identify that you have a female, a male, a child\u201d from studying the remains, but science won\u2019t give them a name, he said. In such cases, authorities may have to rely on reasoning to match what\u2019s known about the remains to who is known to be missing.\n\n\u201cThat manifest may ultimately be the only thing you have to potentially identify that the victims that were recovered from that location could be those victims,\u201d he said.\n\nNew York medical examiners have worked to match nearly 22,000 fragments of human remains to the 2,753 people killed at the World Trade Center. More than 17 years later, 40 percent of the dead have never had any of their remains identified. But the painstaking process still yields results: The remains of one victim, 26-year-old Scott Michael Johnson, were identified in July for the first time.\n\nWhatever the process proves to be for California authorities, DePaolo said, \u201cit\u2019s a tough and complex job that they have ahead of them, and our condolences go out to them.\u201d", "November 12, 2018\n\nThe (Champaign) News-Gazette\n\nPritzker eager to take the helm\n\nTriumphant Democrat J.B. Pritzker celebrated a smashing victory in last week\u2019s gubernatorial election with an animated speech in which he promised to \u201covercome our biggest challenges\u201d with bold and dramatic policy changes.\n\n\u2033... ladies and gentleman, rise we will. We make no small plans for Illinois,\u201d he declared to a cheering crowd.\n\nThat sounds good. That\u2019s why Illinoisans hope Pritzker, a billionaire businessman who has never held public office, will be as successful in lifting this state out of the fiscal gutter as he promises.\n\nBut winning election nights are one thing \u2014 governing in this state is quite another.\n\nPritzker certainly won\u2019t face the legislative roadblocks that doomed his predecessor, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. But the yellow brick road he\u2019ll walk on the long journey to fiscal recovery is littered with major hurdles.\n\nThey include the long-standing Illinois tradition of passing deficit budgets, $7.6 billion in unpaid bills (as of Sept. 30) and, worst of all, a mammoth unfunded public pension liability of, at a minimum, $130 billion.\n\nSo what Pritzker is attempting will be, at a minimum, extremely difficult and, at maximum, virtually impossible.\n\nPritzker didn\u2019t waste any time getting to work. He announced transition teams made up of the usual cross-section of government, business and financial leaders.\n\nHe also gave a series of interviews in which he discussed \u2014 on a superficial level \u2014 his plans.\n\nPritzker, apparently, will rely on revenue generated from his planned legalization of marijuana as well as a dramatic expansion of gambling (sports betting in addition to what\u2019s already in place).\n\nHe also spoke favorably of a multibillion capital spending plan, while pointedly not embracing the inevitable tax hikes \u2014 gas or mileage \u2014 needed to fund it.\n\nHe acknowledged what everyone already knows, that passing an amendment to the Illinois Constitution in 2020 is a time eater.\n\nPritzker also appeared to back off his plan for an immediate increase in the current 4.95 state income tax to generate the additional revenue he\u2019s seeking.\n\nWill he feel differently in February or March? Maybe, maybe not.\n\nA state legislative committee recently reported that, as a consequence of a stronger state economy and a series of tax increases, \u201cthe first third of FY 2019 shows general funds ahead of last year by $595 million.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a welcome addition to the state\u2019s coffers. Unfortunately, in the context of the state\u2019s overall debts and deficits, it\u2019s chump change.\n\nState elected officials have long recognized that Illinois\u2019 financial problems make it difficult to shower favored groups with financial benefits. They can, however, use their legislative authority to make private sector entities spend money.\n\nSo it\u2019s no great surprise that Pritzker also has said one of his highest priorities will be to increase the minimum wage, in stages, to $15 an hour. That\u2019s good news for those who will get the wage hikes and bad news for businesses operating on thin margins and the employees, many of them young people, they will have to lay off to control their costs.\n\nPritzker\u2019s statements so far offer mere hints as to what is forthcoming.\n\nThe election took place less than a week ago, and he won\u2019t be sworn into office until January. The public will learn much more as he and the overwhelmingly Democratic Legislature start charting policy changes in earnest.\n\nThat\u2019s when Pritzker will be torn between what he has said he would like to do \u2014 pass major social spending programs and raise taxes to pay for them \u2014 and what the state\u2019s weak financial standing will allow him to do.\n\n___\n\nNovember 8, 2018\n\nThe Quincy Herald-Whig\n\nWith campaign in past, Illinois must move forward\n\nThere were few surprises election night as results were reported across the Land of Lincoln, which saw Democrat J.B. Pritzker handily defeat Republican incumbent Gov. Bruce Rauner.\n\nMore than 640,000 votes separated the two in what was a landslide victory for the billionaire Pritzker, who claimed 54 percent of the statewide vote. Rauner was done in by four years of gridlock, an unwillingness to compromise on the budget stalemate and perceived mismanagement of the Legionella outbreak at the Illinois Veterans Home in Quincy.\n\nThat, coupled with a suburban electorate eager to turn out to voice their displeasure with President Donald Trump, led to a 15-point blowout for Pritzker, a Democratic sweep of statewide offices and gains in both chambers of the General Assembly. The so-called Blue Wave might not have materialized across the country in the manner some had predicted, but in Illinois, it was thunderous.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t so across West-Central Illinois, however. In Adams County, Rauner took nearly 66 percent of the vote, down 10 points from his 2014 win, but still an impressive local haul. Republican candidates up and down the ticket here fared well, cementing local GOP dominance. No statewide candidate took any of Adams, Brown Hancock or Pike counties. Only incumbent Secretary of State Jesse White even came close.\n\nAgain, there were few surprises.\n\nPlans now are being laid for what comes next.\n\nSimply put, if Pritzker fails, Illinois fails. And if Illinois fails, we all fail. We do not want that to happen.\n\nLooking back at the campaign, we are heartened by many of the things we saw from Pritzker.\n\nWhile some decried the lack of details to many of Pritzker\u2019s proposals, we were encouraged by his notion the problems facing the state will take multifaceted solutions. He said repeatedly he looks forward to negotiations and compromise to find a path forward for the state. There will be no simple solutions, he told us.\n\nWe applaud Rauner, who in his concession speech Tuesday night, called on the state to come together.\n\nIn claiming victory, Pritzker spoke of bridging divides.\n\nIt\u2019s our profound hope Illinoisans of all political stripes remember this and work to move this great state forward and rise once again to meet the challenges before us.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentleman, rise we will,\u201d Pritzker promised on election night.\n\nLet\u2019s all pray that we do.\n\n___\n\nNovember 9, 2018\n\nSauk Valley Media\n\nThe election\u2019s over; let\u2019s solve problems\n\nElections have consequences, and election night\u2019s vote was for change in Illinois.\n\nWhen new officeholders are sworn in come January, Democrats will be in the driver\u2019s seat. They will have supermajority control of the state House and Senate, and will control all statewide elected offices beginning in 2019, led by Governor-elect J.B. Pritzker.\n\nDemocrats will control the levers of power, but that does not give them ownership of Illinois government. The government still serves all the people, and the tax and regulatory burdens that government now imposes are driving some people and businesses out of state.\n\nIt will take Democrats and Republicans working together to solve this problem in the years ahead.\n\nRepublicans faced tough realities in this midterm election. President Donald Trump is unpopular here. At the top of the state ticket, Gov. Bruce Rauner trailed in the polls for months, and eventually lost by about 15 points and became the first governor in more than 40 years to be unseated after a single term.\n\nThough voters had myriad reasons for voting as they did, there are several things for which they did not vote.\n\nFew people went to the polls on Tuesday to vote for higher taxes for themselves. When Pritzker talks about raising income taxes on \u201cthe wealthy,\u201d most of us assume he is talking about people like himself - now the wealthiest political officeholder in America, with a fortune of more than $3 billion and who spent a staggering $171 million on his campaign.\n\nPritzker was content to foster that assumption. He scrupulously avoided providing any information about who would pay more in taxes under a graduated tax plan, which will require amending the state constitution. We\u2019re still waiting to see how many of us eventually will learn we are wealthy.\n\nAny move to increase income taxes without shifting the school funding burden away from the property tax will make this Democratic dominance in Springfield short-lived. It\u2019s the property tax burden that\u2019s driving people out of Illinois; it must be reduced.\n\nFew of us voted for state government to ignore the pension liability that continues to consume more of the state\u2019s budget.\n\nFew of us voted to abandon the cause of reform. In addition to property tax relief, concepts such as term limits for legislators and legislative leaders, and fair drawing of legislative maps are widely popular among voters in this state. They should be given an up-or-down vote in Springfield or an advisory vote at the ballot box. It is time to stop fighting these initiatives - let the people vote on them.\n\nWhen 2019 begins, Pritzker and the party he leads indeed are in the driver\u2019s seat in Springfield. It will be their prerogative to act on their agenda in the future. As Illinoisans, we will share in that future and so we hope for success for our state under his leadership.\n\nBut that future should be shaped by the good ideas of members of both parties. The election is over, and we all must work together to solve our state\u2019s problems.", "OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The Golden State Warriors don\u2019t expect Draymond Green\u2019s latest dustup with Kevin Durant to become a long-term issue for the two-time defending NBA champions.\n\nNor do they expect the emotional Green to change after his one-game suspension by the team Tuesday.\n\nDurant said he expects to work things out with Green, saying, \u201cI\u2019m sure it will, we\u2019ve got a long season ahead.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis presence has been a part of this team for a while, even before I got here he\u2019d been a huge staple in this organization,\u201d Durant said. \u201cObviously it\u2019s definitely weird not having him around and everything that went down. But that\u2019s what happens, (stuff) happens in the NBA.\u201d\n\nGreen was suspended one game without pay for conduct detrimental to the team following an altercation a night earlier with Durant, though general manager Bob Myers declined to offer specifics on the All-Star forward\u2019s behavior that was considered going too far. Myers and Steve Kerr collaborated on the decision.\n\n\u201cWe just felt like this rose to the level of acting the way we did,\u201d Myers said, noting of Green: \u201cHe was professional. He loves to play basketball, which is all you can ask of him.\u201d\n\nThe Warriors made the announcement about four hours before they were set to host Atlanta, and the 28-year-old Green was serving the suspension as his teammates beat the Hawks 110-103. He wasn\u2019t at Oracle Arena and didn\u2019t immediately respond to a text message seeking comment.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019re a team that goes through stuff, just like everybody else. And things happen, bumps in the road. You\u2019ve got to move forward. It\u2019s all part of coaching a team, it\u2019s all part of being on a team. You have to get through the adversity and there are some difficult times and you just get through them.\u201d\n\nIn the closing seconds of regulation during Monday\u2019s 121-116 overtime loss on the road to the Clippers, Green secured a rebound and, with Durant calling for the ball, instead dribbled the length of the court into traffic and lost control as the Warriors failed to get a shot off. Durant was shown on camera visibly upset immediately afterward.\n\nThen, back on the bench waiting for the extra period to begin, the two traded words and gestured with Klay Thompson seated between them and Andre Iguodala, DeMarcus Cousins and others trying to calm the situation.\n\nDurant wouldn\u2019t get into the specifics of what was said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to keep that in house, that\u2019s what we do here. I\u2019m not trying to give nobody no headlines,\u201d Durant said. \u201cWhat happened, happened. We\u2019re trying to move on, we\u2019re just trying to play basketball.\u201d\n\nFor everyone who figures this franchise is perfect, Myers quickly cleared up that notion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to win a championship. You can\u2019t allow anything else in your locker room, in the narrative. This team has done a good job of that,\u201d Myers said. \u201cI know it may appear as if it\u2019s looked easy over the last however many years. It\u2019s not. If you\u2019re in our locker room, if you\u2019re in our organization, it\u2019s hard.\n\n\u201cAnd so they\u2019ll get through it, and we\u2019ll keep moving. Hopefully we get to the finals and win a championship. That\u2019s all anybody\u2019s thinking about, because I think that\u2019s all you can think about. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to keep doing. This team has proven that they will do that and continue to do that and have done that.\u201d\n\nMyers and Kerr have long supported Green\u2019s fiery nature that leads to technical fouls. Myers even sat with Green next door to Oracle Arena at the Oakland Coliseum when Green was suspended for a crucial Game 5 loss to LeBron James and the Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals. The Warriors wound up losing in seven.\n\nGreen apologized after yelling at Kerr during halftime of a game at Oklahoma City in February 2016.\n\n\u201cMy feeling on Draymond and his impact on our team doesn\u2019t change. These things happen sometimes over the course of an NBA season,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe deal with it \u2014 again, internally \u2014 so any conversations that are happening or have happened it\u2019s our business.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first verbal altercation between Durant, the two-time reigning NBA Finals MVP, and Green. In another overtime loss, 109-106 at Sacramento on Feb. 4, 2017, they shouted at each other and argued near the bench.\n\n\u201cHow you handle things after they happen is the most important thing,\u201d Myers said.\n\nKerr said he spoke to Green, who was part of the recruiting group that worked to sway Durant to the Bay Area from Oklahoma City before the 2016-17 season.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve won championships together, they\u2019ve been teammates, now this is the third season, they were teammates on the Olympic team,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cDraw your own conclusions.\u201d\n\nGreen has been off to a strong start this season for the two-time defending NBA champions, averaging 7.5 points, 7.8 rebounds and 7.4 assists. Kerr has credited him for taking great care of the ball and establishing a tempo on both ends of the floor.\n\nThe game at Los Angeles marked Green\u2019s return from a two-game absence with a sprained right foot and toe.\n\n\u201cDraymond is always going to be who he is. He\u2019s a powerful force,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe\u2019s a huge reason why we\u2019ve had so much success here.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Authorities say two workers have suffered burns in an electrical accident a Los Angeles water filtration plant.\n\nThe Fire Department says it happened at around 2:45 p.m. Tuesday at a Granada Hills facility.
