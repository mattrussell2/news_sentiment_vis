He also paid homage to Lech Walesa, the Solidarity trade union founder who challenged Poland\u2019s Soviet-backed communist rule during the 1980s and went on to become president from 1990 to 1995.\n\n\u201cJozef Pilsudski was facing a more difficult situation than we have today when he was conquering the Bolsheviks and in fact, defending the Western community against political barbarians,\u201d Tusk said during an independent anniversary forum gathering intellectuals and politicians.\n\n\u201cWalesa had a more difficult situation when he was conquering the Bolsheviks in a symbolic way, when he was bringing out the European, the freedom, the national values in us. But he managed,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t you be able to defeat the contemporary Bolsheviks?\u201d Tusk said to great applause.\n\nHe appealed for Poles to defend their rights, freedom and to \u201cdefend Poland\u2019s independence.\u201d\n\nHe criticized the government led by the conservative Law and Justice party, which has repeatedly clashed with European Union leaders, as a threat to Poland.\n\n\u201cWhoever today in Poland takes steps against our strong position in a united Europe is really taking steps against Poland\u2019s independence,\u201d Tusk said.\n\nDeputy Senate Speaker Adam Bielan, a member of the ruling team, responded later by saying that Tusk was trying to divide Poles and provoke conflict on the eve of a big national holiday.\n\nTusk\u2019s appointment to the EU job in 2014 partly was in recognition of his liberal government\u2019s pro-EU policies. He warned Saturday that the government now influenced by Law and Justice head Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Tusk\u2019s political foe, is moving in the opposite direction.\n\nIn hopes of preventing anything from marring the centennial commemorations, Polish government officials negotiated a deal to hold a joint march in Warsaw on Sunday with nationalist groups that had planned their own event.\n\nPast independence day marches held by far-right nationalists featured racist slogans, white supremacist symbols and aggressive behavior.", "FILE In this Nov. 11, 1918 file photo, American troops cheer after hearing the news that the Armistice had been signed, ending World War I.

The German artillery responded feebly, but the machine-gun resistance was stubborn. Nevertheless, the Americans made progress.

The infantry were advancing, glancing at their watches. The men holding at other places organized their position to make themselves more secure.\n\nThen the individual groups unfurled the Stars and Stripes, shook hands and cheered.

(AP Photo, File)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 They were messengers, spies and sentinels. They led cavalry charges, carried supplies to the front, comforted wounded soldiers and died by the millions during World War I.\n\nHorses, mules, dogs, pigeons and even a baboon all were a vital \u2014 and for decades overlooked \u2014 part of the Allied war machine.\n\nResearchers have been hard-pressed to find official accounts of the services rendered by animals during the Great War. But if their labors once were taken for granted, four-legged and winged warriors have been acknowledged more recently as unsung heroes.\n\nFrance recently decided to recognize their wartime role. And in 2004, Britain installed a huge memorial on the edge of London\u2019s Hyde Park to \u201call the animals that served, suffered and died alongside the British, Commonwealth and Allied forces in the wars and conflicts of the 20th century.\u201d\n\nVIDEO: Animals paid a terrible price in World War I.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how they contributed.\n\n___\n\nWHAT THEY DID\n\nAn estimated 10 million horses and mules, 100,000 dogs and 200,000 pigeons were enrolled in the war effort, according to Eric Baratay, a French historian specializing in the response of animals to the chaos, fear and smells of death in the mission that man thrust upon them.\n\nWorld War I marked the start of industrial warfare, with tanks, trucks, aircraft and machine guns in action. But the growing sophistication of the instruments of death couldn\u2019t match the dog tasked with finding the wounded, the horses and mules hauling munitions and food or the pigeons serving as telecommunications operators or even eyes, carrying \u201cpigeongrams\u201d or tiny cameras to record German positions.\n\n\u201cThey were quasi-combatants,\u201d said Serge Barcellini, comptroller general of the Armed Forces and head of Le Souvenir Francais \u2014 The French Memory \u2014 in a recent speech devoted to the role played by beasts of war.\n\nIndeed, gas masks were fitted to the muzzles of four-legged warriors braving noxious battlefield fumes.\n\nIn France, as in Britain and elsewhere, horses and mules were requisitioned.\n\nOne typical sign posted in southern Paris ordered citizens to present their steeds and mules to the Requisition Committee by Nov. 14, 1914, or risk \u201cprosecution by the military authority.\u201d It was becoming clear there would be no quick end to the war that ground on for four more years.\n\n___\n\nFEATHERED HEROES\n\nCher Ami, or Dear Friend, the carrier pigeon who wouldn\u2019t quit, lived up to her name, saving the lives of 194 American troops of the \u201cLost Battalion\u201d of the 77th Infantry Division, isolated behind enemy lines during the 1918 Meuse-Argonne offensive in eastern France.\n\nAbout 550 men had held their ground against a far larger German force for days before coming under fire from American troops unaware the trapped soldiers weren\u2019t the enemy.\n\nOn Oct. 4, Maj. Charles Whittlesey sent Cher Ami into the skies with a final message giving the U.S. battalion\u2019s location, followed by a plea: \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake stop it.\u201d\n\nCher Ami lost an eye and a leg from German gunfire, but kept flying, around 25 miles (40 kilometers) in about a half-hour, according to the United States World War One Centennial Commission. Survivors of the \u201cLost Battalion\u201d returned to American lines four days later.\n\nAnother carrier pigeon named Vaillant, assigned to the French military, also performed extraordinary feats during the war.\n\nOn June 4, 1916, he was released into the sky with the desperate message, \u201cHe\u2019s my last pigeon.\u201d\n\nFrench Commander Sylvain Eugene Raynal, encircled by Germans at the Fort de Vaux near Verdun, was counting on Vaillant to save his men.\n\nThe feisty bird flew through toxic gas and smoke, reaching the Verdun pigeon loft choked by fumes. With no help arriving despite Vaillant\u2019s courageous effort, Raynal and his men surrendered three days later.\n\nBoth Cher Ami and Vaillant were awarded France\u2019s Croix de Guerre, or War Cross.\n\n\u2018They had no choice\u2019 The words inscribed on the wonderful Animals In War Memorial in London.

They died by the millions, from disease, exhaustion and enemy fire, forcing the French and British armies to turn to America to renew their supply. A veritable industry developed with more than half a million horses and mules shipped by boat to Europe by fall 1917, according to the American Battle Monuments Commission.\n\nSo important was the commerce that the Santa Fe Railroad named a station Drage, after British Lt. Col. F.B. Drage, the commander of the British Remount Commission in Lathrop, Missouri, a major stockyard for the future beasts of war.\n\n\u201cSo the war business in horses and mules is good,\u201d read an article in the December 1915 issue of The Santa Fe Magazine, for employees of the railway system. Good for the farmer, contractor, supplier and railroads, it said, but \u201cnot good for the animals.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSERVICE BY EXOTICS\n\nAmong the more exotic animals called into service was a baboon named Jackie, who served with the 1st South African Infantry Brigade in then British-occupied Egypt and later in the trenches in France and Belgium. His acute hearing and keen eyesight helped warn soldiers of enemy movement or possible attacks when he would screech and tug on their clothing.\n\nJackie was wounded in Flanders Fields when the South African brigade came under heavy shelling in April 1918 and his leg had to be amputated.\n\nLt. Col. R.N. Woodsend, of Britain\u2019s Royal Medical Corps, described that procedure: \u201cHe lapped up the chloroform as if it had been whiskey, and was well under in a remarkably short time. It was a simple matter to amputate the leg with scissors.\u201d\n\n___\n\nDOGS OF WAR\n\nMan\u2019s best friend helped soldiers survive. Dogs served, firstly, as spotters of the wounded, learning to identify ally from enemy. They also served as sentinels, messengers, transporters and chasers of rats \u2014 the bane of the trenches along with lice and fleas. The French military created a service devoted to dogs of war in December 1915.\n\nLess official, but crucial to soldiers\u2019 morale, was the role of dogs and other creatures in the trenches, and as mascots. Stray dogs running from fighting were adopted as companions along with other animals, including a Royal Air Force fox mascot adopted by British pilots.\n\nThese dogs and other mascots helped soldiers \u201cthink of life ... and the life they hoped to find again,\u201d said Baratay, the French historian, in a speech last month in Paris.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press\u2019 WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

The organization\u2019s count is considered by many international agencies to be one of the most credible, although all caution it is likely an underestimate because of the difficulties in tracking deaths.\n\nThe numbers don\u2019t include those who have died in the humanitarian disaster caused by the war, particularly starvation. Though there are no firm figures, the aid group Save the Children estimated hunger may have killed 50,000 children in 2017. That was based on a calculation that around 30 percent of severely malnourished children who didn\u2019t receive proper treatment likely died.\n\nRenewed uproar over the destruction has put Washington in a corner. The U.S. has sold billions of dollars in weaponry to Saudi Arabia, backing the fight to stop Shiite rebels known as Houthis, who Washington and the coalition consider a proxy for Iran.\n\nThat along with tensions over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul may be key factors why Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Oct. 30 made their biggest push yet for an end to the war, calling for a ceasefire within 30 days and resumed negotiations.\n\nOnly a month earlier, Pompeo gave a powerful show of support to the coalition by certifying to Congress that Saudi Arabia and its allies were taking measures to prevent civilian casualties. Certification was a required step in continuing U.S. aid, which includes providing intelligence used in targeting and mid-air refueling for coalition planes.\n\nBut deaths from the coalition campaign show no sign of slowing.\n\nCoalition airstrikes and shelling killed at least 4,489 civilians since the beginning of 2016 \u2014 nearly three-quarters of all known civilian deaths, according to ACLED\u2019s figures.\n\nAs of Nov. 3, at least 1,254 civilians were killed by the coalition this year, a rate of four a day. In comparison, 1,386 civilians died in strikes the previous year, or 3.79 a day.\n\nAsked about the finding, the U.S. State Department said in an emailed reply, \u201cThroughout this conflict, the United States has urged all parties to abide by the Law of Armed Conflict, work to prevent harm to civilians and civilian infrastructure, and thoroughly investigate and ensure accountability for any violations.\u201d\n\nBloodshed has surged from fierce fighting at the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, which coalition forces have been trying to retake from the Houthis since June. Civilians have been killed in airstrikes as well as by Houthi shelling and land mines.\n\nSince June, more than 4,500 people \u2014 including 515 confirmed civilians \u2014 have been killed in Hodeida, nearly triple the number from the first five months of the year.\n\nAid agencies fear worse is yet to come. The coalition appears to be accelerating its assault before any cease-fire. Its forces have nearly encircled the city, where tens of thousands of people are trapped along with thousands of Houthi fighters. The port is Yemen\u2019s main point of entry for food and humanitarian aid, so any cutoff could push millions into starvation.\n\nThe coalition launched its air campaign in March 2015 after the Houthis took over northern and central Yemen, driving out the internationally recognized government. The rebels were prevented from overrunning the south only by the coalition\u2019s bombardment and support for militia forces.\n\nTracking casualties is enormously difficult. The few independent monitors on the ground do not have wide access; officials on both sides have an interest in manipulating figures; deaths often take place in remote areas and even in populated areas, confusion of battle makes confirming numbers hard.\n\nThe most widely used estimate has been 10,000 dead, made in January 2017 by the United Nations.\n\nIn October, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator said at least 65,000 people have been killed or injured since 2016, including 16,000 civilians killed, based on data from health centers. U.N. officials did not reply to queries to elaborate on the figures.\n\nACLED builds its database on news reports from Yemeni and international media and international agencies. It covers everything from airstrikes, shelling and ground battles between the various forces to militant bombings and violence at protests. The group receives funding in part from the U.S. State Department and Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nBecause of its transparency, its figures are often cited by U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations. But they caution that even ACLED\u2019s data cannot give the full picture \u2014 only \u201cthe least bad best guess\u201d as an official at one agency put it.\n\nPinning down how many of the dead are civilians is even tougher.\n\nACLED counted 6,242 civilians killed since 2016 by \u201cremote violence\u201d on civilian targets \u2014 meaning airstrikes, artillery or shelling by either side. Of those, shelling by the Houthis or their allies killed 977.\n\nThe full toll is likely much higher. The vast majority of deaths \u2014 more than 34,000 \u2014 are categorized by ACLED as resulting from battles. But it is impossible to determine whether those are combatants or civilians, Carboni said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely an underestimate,\u201d he said of the civilian toll. \u201cThe numbers caught in the crossfire are not known.\u201d\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writers Maggie Michael in Cairo and Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.", "Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, front right, attends a wreath-laying ceremony at the mausoleum of the nation's founding father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, during a ceremony to mark the 80th anniversary of his death, in Ankara, Turkey, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018.

But critics say the South risks conceding some of its conventional military strength before North Korea takes any meaningful steps on denuclearization \u2014 an anxiety that\u2019s growing as the larger nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang seemingly drift into a stalemate.\n\nSouth Korea reportedly has about 60 guard posts \u2014 bunker-like concrete structures surrounded with layers of barbed-wire fences and manned by soldiers equipped with machine guns \u2014 stretched across the ironically named Demilitarized Zone.\n\nThe 248-kilometer (155-mile) border buffer peppered with millions of land mines has been the site of occasional skirmishes between the two forces since the 1950-53 Korean War. The North is believed to have about 160 guard posts within the DMZ.\n\nIn the September military agreement, reached on the sidelines of a summit in Pyongyang between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, the Koreas pledged to eventually withdraw all guard posts within the DMZ, but to start by removing 11 from each side as a \u201cpreliminary\u201d measure.\n\nThe South Korean Defense Ministry official said soldiers on Saturday completed disarming 11 guard posts on the southern side of the DMZ. He said the ministry believes the North has also finished withdrawing personnel and weapons from 11 guard posts on the northern side of the DMZ. He didn\u2019t want to be named, citing office rules.\n\nThe Koreas plan to destroy 20 of the structures by the end of November, while symbolically leaving one demilitarized guard post on each side. They plan to jointly verify the results in December.\n\nThe Koreas also in the September deal agreed to create buffer zones along their land and sea boundaries and a no-fly zone above the border, which took effect on Nov. 1.\n\nThe Koreas and the U.S.-led U.N. Command recently finished removing firearms and troops from a jointly controlled area at the border village of Panmunjom and eventually plan to allow tourists to freely move around there. The Koreas have also been clearing mines from front-line areas and plan to start in April their first-ever joint search for remains of soldiers killed during the Korean War.\n\nWhile the Korean militaries move ahead with tension-reducing steps, Moon is otherwise running out of goodwill gestures toward North Korea, which is under heavy U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons program. Unless the sanctions are lifted, it would be impossible for Moon to push ahead with his more ambitious plans for engagement, such as reconnecting railways and roads across the border and normalizing operations at a jointly run factory park.\n\nPyongyang insists that sanctions should be removed before there is any progress in nuclear negotiations, while Washington says they will remain until the North takes concrete steps toward irreversibly and verifiably relinquishing its weapons.\n\nAnalysts say the discord may have caused the last-minute cancellation of a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong Chol, that had been scheduled for this past Thursday to discuss denuclearization issues and setting up a second summit between Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump.", "Jordanian rescue teams search Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018 for missing people in the Madaba area, south of the capital of Amman, after flash floods unleashed by heavy rain a day earlier killed at least 12 people.

The White House sent a delegation that included chief of staff John Kelly in his place.\n\nThe dustup over European security, which threatened to divert attention from the weekend\u2019s somber remembrance ceremonies, was just the latest example of fallout from Trump\u2019s unpredictable brand of Twitter-assisted diplomacy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron worked Saturday to ease tensions over their comments about European security that threatened to divert attention from a weekend ceremony marking 100 years since the end of World War I. (Nov.10)\n\nHis fractious, destabilizing relationship with Europe has driven a wedge between the U.S. and some of its oldest allies on issues including trade, defense spending and his seeming deference to their looming neighbor to the east, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. It also underscored the hot-and-cold relationship that Trump has had with Macron, who has increasingly branded himself as a bulwark against the rising tide of Trump-style nationalism across Europe.\n\nThe brouhaha began Friday night, when Trump unleashed an angry Twitter jab at his host just as Air Force One touched down in Paris. Trump tweeted that Macron \u201chas just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet was especially wounding to Macron. Macron\u2019s office said Trump had misunderstood the French leaders\u2019 comments, lumping together two different ideas. Macron had said in an interview that Europe needs to protect itself against cyber threats and the \u201cinterference in our democracies\u201d from \u201cChina, Russia and even the United States.\u201d Later, he made the case that Europe needs to build up its own military because it can no longer depend on the U.S. for defense.\n\nThe two men struck a more friendly tone as they opened their meeting at the grand presidential residence.\n\n\u201cWe want to help Europe but it has to be fair. Right now, the burden-sharing has been largely on the United States,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump has long complained about uncompensated U.S. defense spending that benefits allies, and earlier this year threatened to turn his back on NATO if members didn\u2019t boost their defense spending. Trump said Macron \u201cunderstands that and he understands the United States can only do so much.\u201d\n\nMacron defended his viewpoint, saying he shares Trump\u2019s insistence that there be more burden sharing. He said it\u2019s \u201cunfair to have the European security today being assured just by the United States,\u201d but did not respond to a question about why he felt France needed protection from the U.S.\n\nThe episode was the latest example of a frequent Trump pattern: introducing tension before meeting with a world leader, then playing nice when they\u2019re face-to-face.\n\nBefore Trump traveled to Britain earlier this year, he gave an interview to a British tabloid in which he insulted British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s approach to the United Kingdom leaving the European Union. Trump said her political nemesis would make a great prime minister.\n\nThe interview was published as Trump was attending a grand welcome dinner hosted by May only hours after he arrived in London. Trump was far more cordial to May in person, complimenting her leadership and expressing his great respect for her.\n\nIt was the same with Macron, who welcomed Trump in the courtyard of the Elysee Palace with a handshake and pats on the arm. Inside a gilded meeting room, Macron referred to Trump as \u201cmy good friend\u201d and, at one point, tapped him on the thigh. Trump said they had become \u201cvery good friends over the last couple of years\u201d and were \u201csimilar in our views\u201d on many issues.\n\nMacron early on had tried to position himself as Europe\u2019s \u201cTrump whisperer.\u201d But their personal relationship has failed to make much difference when it comes to stopping Trump from pursuing policies Macron strongly opposes.\n\nDespite his insistent urging, Trump failed to heed Macron and other European leaders\u2019 advice not to pull the U.S. out of the landmark Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal. He also refused to spare France from the tariffs he\u2019s slapped on steel and aluminum imports, citing national security risks. Trump has also been chipping away at a rules-based, multilateral system the U.S. helped build and Macron has worked to defend.\n\nWeaker at home for unpopular economic policies and increasingly isolated in Europe, Macron has been positioning himself as a sort of anti-Trump, speaking out against the rising tide of Trump-style populist nationalism across Europe and the dangers of isolationist retreat. At the U.N. General Assembly this year, Macron said: \u201cNationalism always leads to defeat,\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s starting to become the antithesis of President Trump\u2019s public messaging,\u201d said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at Center for Strategic and International Studies \u201cHe believes he is one voice that can champion this.\u201d\n\nCentral to those efforts is the inaugural Paris Peace Forum, a gathering of heads of state, government officials, heads of international organizations, corporations, academics, philanthropists and others beginning Sunday. The forum aims to revive collective governance and international cooperation to tackle global challenges.\n\nTrump, however, will not be attending.

Even as he embarked on two days of observances for the Nov. 11, 1918 armistice, Trump said the United States now bears far too much of the burden to defend the West.\n\nA flurry of Armistice-related diplomacy once again turned Paris, the jewel that Germany sought to take in 1914 but which the Allies successfully fought to defend, into the center of global attention Saturday as dozens of world leaders arrived in the French capital on the eve of the solemn centennial commemorations.\n\nMerkel\u2019s appearance in Compiegne marked how her nation\u2019s bloodstained history with France has become a close alliance that is now the driving force behind the European Union.\n\nIn the four years of fighting, remembered for brutal trench warfare and the first use of gas, France, the British empire, Russia and the United States had the main armies opposing a German-led coalition that also included the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires.\n\nUnis. pic.twitter.com/a3we7hpKDJ \u2014 Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) November 10, 2018 Macron\u2019s Twitter account made a point of tweeting a photo of him with Merkel, with the word, \u201cUnited.\u201d\n\nAlmost 10 million soldiers died. France lost 1.4 million and Germany 2 million.\n\nYet, despite a war that was supposed to end all wars, World War II pitted both sides against each other once again in 1940.\n\nAcross the line that once marked the Western Front, leaders lauded the courage of soldiers who were killed during the unprecedented slaughter, before converging on Paris for a dinner.\n\nAt the dinner, Macron warned world leaders against taking peace for granted, saying \u201cwe will talk about this peace that our predecessors tried to construct 100 years ago but failed to preserve, because 20 years later a new war broke out.\u201d\n\nThe armistice entered into force on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, and on Sunday 69 world leaders will commemorate the centennial of the event at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, underneath the Arc de Triomphe in central Paris.\n\nAt dawn Saturday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went to Vimy Ridge, the battlefield in northern France where Canada found its sense of self when it defeated German opposition against the odds.\n\nStanding amid the white headstones against an ashen sky, Trudeau addressed the fallen, saying what Canada has achieved in the past century has been \u201ca history built on your sacrifice. You stand for the values on which Canada was built.\u201d\n\nIn southern Belgium\u2019s Mons, Canadians were also lauding George Price, the last Commonwealth soldier to die in the war when he was shot by a German sniper two minutes before the armistice took effect.\n\nTrump was looking beyond the tragedy of death and destruction, asking in a tweet: \u201cIs there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war, in particular that one, which was one of the bloodiest and worst of all time?\u201d\n\nAfter his meeting with Macron, Trump had been scheduled to head to the battlefield of Belleau Wood, 90 kilometers (55 miles) northeast of the capital, where U.S. troops had their breakthrough battle by stopping a German push for Paris shortly after entering the war in 1917.\n\nThe battle of Belleau Wood proved America\u2019s mettle to allies and foes alike, and by the time the war ended U.S. forces were at least an equal to any of the other major armies, which were exhausted and depleted.\n\nHowever, Trump canceled his visit because of bad weather and immediately came in for criticism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible that a president would travel to France for this significant anniversary - and then remain in his hotel room watching TV rather than pay in person his respects to the Americans who gave their lives in France for the victory gained 100 years ago tomorrow,\u201d David Frum, a speechwriter for former President George W. Bush, tweeted,\n\nThe White House sent a delegation that included chief of staff John Kelly in Trump\u2019s place. Ben Rhodes, who served as deputy national security adviser in the Obama administration, said the White House should have had a fallback plan for the president.\n\n\u201cThere is always a rain option. Always,\u201d Rhodes said.\n\nTrump is scheduled to visit a different U.S. cemetery close to Paris on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nJohn Leicester contributed.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press\u2019 WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

She just remembers injecting herself with a bag, and then waking up surrounded by paramedics frantically trying to revive her.\n\nSaccomanno, who has been addicted to heroin for 10 years, was shaken. But, before long, there was barely anything else to take but fentanyl to stave off the intense pain of withdrawal. Every corner, it seemed, was selling it. Saccomanno and other longtime heroin users found themselves forced to adapt.\n\nFor younger users, like the twentysomethings who live in the camps off Lehigh Avenue, fentanyl is all they\u2019ve ever known. Like others before them, many graduated from using legal painkillers to illicit opioids in the last few years \u2014 except when they turned to the streets to feed their addictions, they were buying a drug much more powerful than their older counterparts had started on.\n\nYoung and old are paying for it with their lives. Fentanyl was present in 84 percent of Philadelphia\u2019s 1,217 fatal overdoses last year, and in 67 percent of the state\u2019s 5,456 overdose deaths in 2017, according to a wide-ranging report on the state of the opioid crisis in Pennsylvania released recently by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nThe report shows how, over the last five years, the opioid crisis ballooned into an overdose crisis \u2014 how fentanyl contaminated the state\u2019s heroin supply, overwhelmed county morgues with overdose victims, and shocked advocates, people in addiction, and law-enforcement officials alike with its sudden ubiquity.\n\nBut to all of them, the explosion of fentanyl makes a kind of terrible sense: Fentanyl is significantly cheaper to produce than heroin. It draws a significantly larger profit. It\u2019s significantly more powerful and more addictive than heroin, even Kensington\u2019s supply, which has long been known as the cheapest and purest in the country.\n\nThese days, Saccomanno uses a combination of heroin and fentanyl, even though she hates it.\n\n\u201cYou get sicker,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to get more fentanyl more often. It makes being able to get well and stay well even harder. But you can\u2019t find anything else.\u201d\n\n\u2018A dramatic shift\u2019\n\nPure economics.\n\nThat\u2019s what law-enforcement officials say is driving the rise of fentanyl in Pennsylvania.\n\nIt has legitimate use as a drug to treat serious pain, like that in cancer patients, and has been on the illicit drug market for at least 15 years, said Pat Trainor, spokesman for the Philadelphia branch of the DEA. But it mostly turned up in unusual overdose rashes and would disappear from the scene again.\n\n\u201cTwo or three years ago, we really saw a pretty dramatic shift,\u201d Trainor said. \u201cIt was initially seen as a cut or an adulterant in low-quality heroin, and it\u2019s really shifted now that it\u2019s pretty much largely \u2014 but not completely \u2014 replaced most of the heroin supply in Philadelphia.\u201d\n\nIn Philadelphia, he said, a kilogram of heroin, or 2.2 pounds, sells for $50,000 to $80,000, and a drug trafficker can make about $500,000 in profit off it. A kilogram of fentanyl sells for $53,000 to $55,000, is 50 to 100 times stronger, and can turn a profit of up to $5 million.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of drug-trafficking organizations, it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said Trainor.\n\nMost of the fentanyl that ends up in Pennsylvania is manufactured in China and smuggled through Mexican drug-trafficking organizations into the United States along the same routes used to traffic heroin, according to the DEA report.\n\nPeople have also tried to make it closer to home, however. Unlike heroin, which is derived from opium poppies, fentanyl and its analogues can be produced in a lab. Earlier this year, DEA agents raided what they thought was a methamphetamine lab in a hotel room in western Pennsylvania. To their surprise, it turned out that the room\u2019s occupant had been trying to make fentanyl.\n\nSeeking out fentanyl\n\nEarlier this year, researchers from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, conducting a survey of opioid users at Kensington\u2019s needle exchange, posed a question to 400 people in active addiction.\n\nThey knew that most of the city\u2019s heroin supply had already been tainted with fentanyl, and wanted to know how people in addiction were reacting. And so they asked drug users what they would do if they knew that fentanyl was in the drugs they were buying.\n\nThe answers they received shocked them. Of the drug users the Health Department surveyed, 45 percent told researchers that they weren\u2019t trying to avoid fentanyl at all \u2014 that they would be more likely to use a bag of fentanyl.\n\n\u201cThere was more acceptance \u2014 it had become part of the community in a way it hadn\u2019t been initially. It was actually something people were going for because it was an enhanced high,\u201d said Kendra Viner, manager of the department\u2019s Opioid Surveillance Program. \u201cAnd people between 25 and 34 years old were significantly more likely to say they would seek out fentanyl.\u201d\n\nA woman who identified herself as \u201cShy,\u201d a longtime heroin user along Kensington Avenue, said she tries to test her heroin for fentanyl, but often resigns herself to the fact that she can\u2019t find anything else to stave off withdrawal.\n\nIn interviews on Kensington Avenue in recent weeks, drug users said they felt they didn\u2019t have much choice: Though the rush of a fentanyl high might have initially felt stronger and better than heroin, it also made returning to heroin difficult. Even though fentanyl was more dangerous, they said, their tolerance for opioids has become so high that heroin was not enough to stave off withdrawal.\n\n\u201cBefore, people were scared of fentanyl, people wouldn\u2019t do it \u2014 but now my body is hooked on it,\u201d said Kia, a 23-year-old interviewed near the Emerald Street encampment last week. \u201cIf I wake up and don\u2019t do heroin cut with fentanyl, I\u2019m still sick.\u201d\n\nPhysicians and addiction researchers have been advocating for some time for more research on how common medication-assisted treatments used to treat heroin addiction work for people who are now accustomed to a drug much stronger than heroin. Viner said more research on fentanyl trends in general is needed \u2014 for example, her survey focused only on drug users in Kensington who use the neighborhood\u2019s needle exchange. It\u2019s harder to track the habits and preferences of the hundreds of people from around the city and suburbs who fly under the radar, coming to the neighborhood just to score.\n\nStill, the DEA wrote in its report, the findings in Philadelphia \u2014 echoed by treatment providers and people in addiction across the state \u2014 are deeply alarming. They\u2019re a sign that a tainted drug supply is driving demand \u2014 not the other way around.\n\nWilliam, a Bensalem man who came to Kensington earlier this week for fentanyl, as he has for the last four months, said he felt trapped by a drug he hadn\u2019t necessarily sought out \u2014 one that he now needs to function, one that is killing his friends and loved ones.\n\n\u201cWithdrawal \u2014 imagine the worst flu you\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said \u2014 then increase that pain by 10. \u201cAnd you know that that one thing you hate \u2014 the thing that makes you feel this way \u2014 is the only thing that will make you feel better.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2EI0cSb\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Philadelphia Inquirer, http://www.inquirer.com", "HAZLETON, Pa. (AP) \u2014 Anthony \u201cTony\u201d Evangelista remembered sending for a souvenir from one of the radio programs he listened to in the 1940s.\n\nThe ring from the \u201cTom Mix Ralston Straight Shooters\u201d program set him back 10 cents and a label from Ralston instant farina.\n\nAnd within a few days \u2014 a wait that seemed like forever for the then 10-year-old \u2014 he received it.\n\nIt was a ring, but not just any old ring. This was an official Tom Mix siren ring, and by blowing its whistle, listeners save the hero\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cRadio really incorporated the kids. It made you a part of what was going on so you couldn\u2019t wait to get those packages at home,\u201d said Evangelista, who grew up in Hazleton and lives in Fleetwood.\n\nEvangelista would eventually amass a collection of hundreds radio premiums that would be featured in the Smithsonian Institution, written about in The New York Times and shown on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nLooking back, the retired art professor said his family was poor. But the radio novelties could be obtained by sending in a proof of purchase from, say, a cereal box, along with a stamp and a small amount of cash.\n\n\u201cAt the time, there were no toy stores. Kids for Christmas would get a shirt or a sweater. The only way to get a toy was if you sent for something over the radio,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine what it was like wanting to run home after school for a package.\u201d\n\nEvangelista became a faithful radio listener when he turned 8.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d have the programs on every half hour. There was \u2018Superman\u2019 followed by \u2018Tom Mix\u2019 on weekdays. And on Saturdays, I\u2019d listen to \u2018Jack Armstrong.\u2019 They were ongoing episodes. I was an only child so listening to the radio was company,\u201d he said.\n\nThe novelties made the programs even more enjoyable.\n\n\u201cWhat was nice about radio was that it included you into the programs,\u201d he said. \u201d\u2018Captain Midnight\u2019 was on after school. You could send for a decoder. They\u2019d work a message in to the program and with that decoder you could figure it out and you would know what was going to happen the next day.\u201d\n\nWheaties cereal sponsored the radio adventure of Jack Armstrong \u2014 and Evangelista remembers sending box labels for prizes.\n\n\u201cJack Armstrong was an all-American boy involved in athletics,\u201d Evangelista explained.\n\nThe radio premiums, he recalled, included cereal bowls with the likenesses of popular athletes like Joe DiMaggio and pedometers that could be affixed to belts.\n\n\u201cCaptain Midnight\u201d was a patriotic show and so were its premiums. \u201cThe Lone Ranger\u201d released an atomic bomb ring in the late 1940s that promised children that they would \u201csee brilliant flashes of light in the inky darkness inside the (ring\u2019s) atom chamber.\u201d The advertisement for the ring noted that it was completely safe.\n\n\u201cI had maybe a dozen items,\u201d Evangelista said. \u201cWhen I went to college, I gave them to my cousin. Years later I started teaching jewelry at Wilkes College, and I thought about the (radio premium) rings with secret compartments, rings that lit up and rings that had compasses.\u201d\n\nHe contacted his cousin, only to learn that the items had been discarded. Evangelista then decided that he\u2019d like to build a collection.\n\nFrom Wilkes, he began teaching art Kutztown University. When colleagues learned that he had an interest in radio premiums, they directed him to nearby antique shops and markets.\n\nSoon he\u2019d have dozens of items. Pins. Wind-up toys. Masks. Dolls. Ray guns.\n\nHe shared his collection with The Museum of Broadcasting in New York City in the late 1970s. A New York Times reporter saw the display and contacted him for an interview. New York magazine followed suit, and Time Life Publishing included his collection in its Encyclopedia of Collectibles.\n\nNext came appearances on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and the \u201cTomorrow\u201d show with host Tom Snyder.\n\n\u201cOne thing just led to another,\u201d Evangelista said. \u201cThen I got a phone call from a curator from the Smithsonian. He met with me and over the years we became friends. We went antiquing together.\u201d\n\nAnother call came from a designer from a paper company. The collection was photographed and featured in promotional booklets sent to printers around the country. Not only that, but one of Evangelista\u2019s Roy Rogers microscope rings was chosen for a scene in the Woody Allen movie, \u201cRadio Days.\u201d\n\nAlthough he has hundreds of items, Evangelista has four favorites.\n\nTwo are Captain Midnight premiums \u2014 one a decoder and the other a ring with a secret compartment. Another is the atomic bomb ring.\n\n\u201cI also cherish the Tom Mix siren ring,\u201d he said, referring to the first piece he ever owned.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2JIHwk3\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Citizens\u2019 Voice, http://www.citizensvoice.com", "LOWER BURRELL, Pa.

(AP) \u2014 The sight of humane officers carrying dozens of tropical birds, a 14-foot boa constrictor, rabbits and rats from a Macungie home recently seemed shocking, if not bizarre. And when officers removed more snakes, as well as skunks, ferrets, alligators and giant tortoises from a Montgomery County home a few days later, the scene bordered on the surreal.\n\nThe news was less shocking to those familiar with the $300 billion wildlife market, where exotic mammals and reptiles can fetch big money \u2014 much of it in illegal sales.\n\nThe industry is regulated by federal, state and county agencies that register and license dealers but whose staffs are plagued by vacancies, giving hoarders and sellers room to amass potentially illegal menageries.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s a very poorly regulated industry,\u201d said Debra Leahy, manager of Captive Wildlife Protection for the Humane Society of the United States.\n\nLehigh County Humane Society officer Barbara Morgan filed dozens of summary, misdemeanor and felony charges in the Macungie case. No charges have been filed in the Upper Hanover Township, Montgomery County, case, but a Humane Society official said the two are related.\n\nLaw makes hoarding easy\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to get many types of animals legally from pet stores, flea markets, breeders and over the internet. Next week, for example, venomous and nonvenomous reptiles will be for sale or trade at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center in Oaks, Montgomery County. Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission agents may be there too, keeping an eye on swaps and sales, according to the show\u2019s website.\n\nBut animals also are smuggled, often through the mail or Federal Express, Leahy said. In one example documented by the Humane Society, a South Carolina man was charged with animal cruelty in 2006 when he tried to mail a box that he said contained cups and saucers, but instead held a 7-foot python and two copperhead snakes.\n\nThe market for exotic animals among collectors and those who want the creatures for food or for making medicine is booming, said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. China is believed to be the top importer of illegal wildlife, she said.\n\n\u201cEast Asia, and East Asian diaspora communities are some of the most intense demand markets,\u201d she said in an email from China, where she is studying the impact of a ban on ivory. \u201cThroughout East Asia, there is huge demand for birds as well as reptiles, such as for pets.\u201d\n\nCollectors, she said, are wealthy people who want to show off and also middle-class people for whom having such things is a symbol of their new wealth. The market for North American animals is highly diverse, she said, with collectors spending thousands of dollars for birds or lizards or fish, even tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nTurtles are a prized delicacy in East Asia, and a Levittown, Bucks County, man was charged this year with trafficking more than 3,500 protected diamondback terrapins \u2014 some that he allegedly poached from New Jersey.\n\nChad Eyler, the Pennsylvania Game Commission\u2019s special permits enforcement officer, said domestic animal body parts, such as bears\u2019 gall bladders, are in demand for practitioners of traditional East Asian medicine.\n\n\u201cIs there an illegal trade on anything?\u201d he said. \u201cSure.\u201d\n\nThere are primarily two federal laws that could come into play when it comes to unusual pets, said Tony Eliseuson, a senior staff attorney for the Animal Legal Defense Fund. One is the Animal Welfare Act, which requires people to obtain permits to exhibit, breed or sell animals. Cold-blooded animals and a few others are exempt from the law.\n\nIf an animal is in danger of extinction, the other federal law that may apply is the Endangered Species Act. But if an animal hoarder does not have any endangered species, there\u2019s nothing in federal law to stop them, Eliseuson said.\n\nOnce the animal is in a Pennsylvania resident\u2019s hands, a hodgepodge of agencies may regulate if and how the animal is kept. Additionally, local laws may apply, making possession of anything other than the most common house pets confusing. For example, state law allows ownership of ferrets, but in Allentown, ferrets are illegal in homes.\n\nDogs, the most commonly regulated household pet in Pennsylvania, are licensed and regulated by the state Agriculture Department, which also has detailed regulations for importing domestic animals kept in captivity, including farm animals and fish.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the department licenses dealers of exotic animals such as birds, fish and reptiles, although the regulation of those animals in the wild belongs to other agencies. It has issued 124 licenses statewide. Additionally, the department requires certificates of veterinary inspection of some animals before they are transported or sold in Pennsylvania, spokeswoman Shannon Powers said.\n\nThe state Game Commission oversees native mammals and birds.\n\nLaws vary by state, too. Small \u201cpocket pets,\u201d such as sugar gliders, are legal to own in 45 states, but not Pennsylvania. A bill that would have legalized ownership of sugar gliders and hedgehogs failed in the state House of Representatives in May.\n\nThe Fish and Boat Commission regulates fish, amphibians and reptiles that are native to Pennsylvania, but not non-native fish, amphibians and reptiles.\n\n\u201cIf you wanted to have a pet alligator, there is no law that restricts you from having a pet alligator,\u201d commission spokesman Mike Parker said.\n\nBut that rule isn\u2019t hard and fast. For example, state rules allow people to possess just one turtle or snake of certain native species, and outright ban the possession of others.\n\nThe rules are less strict about non-native reptiles.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you get to work today and decide you want to have a king cobra as your pet,\u201d said Jesse Rothacker, president of Forgotten Friend Reptile Sanctuary in Lancaster County. \u201cIn Pennsylvania, you could get one. You don\u2019t need to have a permit, you don\u2019t need to have training. Whereas if you were to decide at lunchtime you wanted a mountain lion or a golden eagle, you couldn\u2019t do that. They have licensing, permitting and apprenticeship programs.\u201d\n\nHoles in enforcement\n\nPennsylvania has 113 full-time game wardens and 340 part-timers, but nearly 20 percent of the state\u2019s game districts are not covered, according to the commission\u2019s 2017 annual report. Wardens\u2019 enforcement contacts with outdoors people declined 8 percent from 2016, and prosecutions dropped by more than 1,000 to 7,516, it said.\n\nSimilarly, the Fish and Boat Commission had 18 waterways conservation officer positions vacant last year, and reduced staffing by around 40 positions, but still operated in the red, its annual report said. With 60 officers either ready to retire or able to retire within three years, it said, \u201ccustomer service, public safety and resource protection will continue to diminish.\u201d\n\nEnforcement isn\u2019t just left to state agencies. In Pennsylvania, humane societies have the power to appoint police officers to enforce the state\u2019s animal cruelty laws and make arrests. There are 146 active humane police officers in the state, according to the Agriculture Department.\n\nNonprofit organizations have borne the financial burden of enforcing those laws, and over the last 10 to 15 years, as costs have skyrocketed, many have gotten out of the law enforcement business, said Nicole Wilson, director of humane law enforcement for the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\n\nWilson said sometimes small rescue groups crop up but they often don\u2019t have shelters to house the animals they need to confiscate.\n\nThe responsibility of caring for animals falls to owners, some of whom don\u2019t understand what\u2019s required. Those who buy an exotic animal, sometimes for only a few dollars, have to be prepared for the possibility of caring for it for decades. Many animals need socializing, so companion animals are necessary, said Judy Rutkowski, an Allentown Animal Clinic veterinarian. Some exotics require special lighting and humidity controls, she said.\n\n\u201cPeople think, \u2018I don\u2019t have to take them for a walk,\u2019 \u201d Rutkowski said. \u201cThey think they\u2019re easier than a domestic pet, but they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nThe animals found recently in Macungie and Upper Hanover were in cages and bins, which Leahy called \u201cextraordinarily cruel for them,\u201d Leahy said.\n\nPeople need to provide their reptile pets with entire habitats, including heat and sunlamps, pumps and clean tanks so they\u2019re not living in their own filth, said Rothacker, from the Lancaster County reptile sanctuary.\n\nIt\u2019s a real problem for owners of sulcata tortoises, which were found in the Montgomery County home. The animals can start out the size of table tennis balls and grow to weigh more than 200 pounds, Rothacker said. He gets a couple of dozen requests to take in the tortoises each year.\n\nThey need to live inside during cold months, which can be hard for people to accommodate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having a horse living in your house,\u201d he said.\n\nRothacker said his organization gets between five and 10 intake requests a day, but doesn\u2019t have the capacity to help all the reptiles that people don\u2019t want. A handful of species are chronic offenders: the red-tailed boa constrictor, the red-eared slider, the green iguana, American alligators and African sulcata tortoises.\n\nSometimes he\u2019s called on to take care of pets for the regular reasons: a death in the family, a job change, a move. But other times it\u2019s more of a reptile-specific problem: People just don\u2019t know what they\u2019re getting into.\n\nThey don\u2019t have the option of dumping reptiles, because releasing a non-native reptile into the wild is illegal in Pennsylvania, according to the Fish and Boat Commission.\n\nA recent study by Rutgers University researchers found that inexpensive pets that grow far beyond their immature sizes are the ones most frequently released into the wild, often in environments not conducive to the animals\u2019 health.\n\nA Humane Society database of reptile complaints over about 30 years listed around 850, mostly involving snakes, throughout the United States. In one 2012 incident, a family pet ball python, a nonvenomous snake, bit a 4-year-old girl in Lehighton, the database showed. A year earlier, a Kennett Square, Chester County, man was bitten by a pet rattlesnake; and when authorities investigated, they found eight snakes \u2014 four of them venomous, a 14-foot constricting python, two monitor lizards and an alligator, it said. Not long after that, Kennett Square banned hundreds of animals, including constricting snakes.\n\nThe animals taken from the Macungie and Upper Hanover homes are in legal limbo.\n\nThe Lehigh County Humane Society, which responded to the Macungie call, didn\u2019t have the capacity for all the animals it seized. It sent snakes and birds to organizations that specialize in caring for those types of animals.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2qx7jml\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Morning Call, http://www.mcall.com", "LANCASTER, Pa. (AP) \u2014 Two weeks before the start of school, Joseph Torres, dean of students at George Washington Elementary School, spent a muggy afternoon visiting the homes of incoming kindergartners.\n\nA big, amiable man in a loud orange T-shirt and Madras shorts, Torres strolled through the complex of the 124 units of public housing at Franklin Terrace, waving when youngsters shouted greetings.\n\nTwo faculty members accompanied Torres. Meanwhile, three other teams were stopping by homes elsewhere in Washington\u2019s attendance zone in Lancaster\u2019s Southeast, where over 40 percent of households live in poverty, the highest concentration in Lancaster County.\n\nAlmost two years ago, the Mayor\u2019s Commission to Combat Poverty set a 15-year goal of halving Lancaster\u2019s 29-percent poverty rate, identifying so-called community schools \u2014 which enlist outside partners to meet needs of the disadvantaged \u2014 as one of many initiatives to pursue.\n\nWhile the term \u201ccommunity school\u201d may bring to mind a place, it\u2019s better understood as an equity strategy, one that helps children in high-poverty schools keep up with peers in middle-class schools.\n\nFor some years, the School District of Lancaster, serving 11,300 students in 21 schools, has had six community schools, and a seventh is under development.\n\nWashington Elementary \u2014 with 96.5 percent of students in or near poverty \u2014 began implementing community school strategies in 2008. Ever since it has quietly but purposefully found ways to swing a wrecking ball at barriers to student success. Principal Kathleen Wiercinski says her school aspires to be a model for others.\n\nOne core emphasis at Washington is building relationships with parents, some of whom may have never liked school.\n\nDropping in on parents in August, Torres and his colleagues reminded them of orientation and immunizations. They also hoped to leave them with a sense that they and their kindergartners are becoming part of a supportive community and that they belong.\n\nAs the educators were heading to another home visit, someone called out, \u201cTorres!\u201d\n\nThey turned to find Angel Martinez, a father the team had just visited, approaching with chilled bottles of water for the perspiring crew.\n\nOutside partners\n\nJust south of Hand Middle School on a campuslike block along South Ann Street, 554-student Washington Elementary is a broad, two-story, 44-classroom building, bright and well-maintained after a major upgrade eight years ago.\n\nEach school day before 8:30 a.m., children stream down sidewalks or climb out of vehicles idling between traffic cones. Meanwhile, about 60 educators get set for a day in which they may not have the luxury of just being teachers. At any time a child may enter a classroom burdened by a challenge arising outside of school.\n\nAny school would, of course, try to get help for a struggling child.\n\nBut at Washington, educators have allies in the trenches with them. They are outside providers who can help with problems like hunger and housing insecurity that interfere with learning but are beyond the expertise of teachers to solve.\n\nThe Boys & Girls Club has been Washington\u2019s lead partner since 2011, and Arelis Perez, a Boys Club employee, works full time at the school as the point person for community school work, freeing the principal to focus on improving instruction.\n\nA quick, effective response to a child\u2019s difficulty is in a community school\u2019s DNA. So, too, is looking beyond crisis management and trying to change or improve systems to prevent problems.\n\nIf a child shows up for school without required vaccinations and physicals, a school health clinic can step in, solving that immediate problem.\n\nThe aim is to keep a child from missing a beat in class.\n\nBut Karen Schloer, Boys & Girls Club executive director, said Washington is also asking the bigger questions, such as: Why do some families fail to get medical checkups for their children? Do they have transportation needs, language barriers, work conflicts? And what can be done about it?\n\nNearly 20 years ago, Michele Byers, now assistant principal at Washington, got an unexpected lesson on childhood poverty.\n\nA new teacher at Wickersham in Lancaster, Byers showed her fourth graders a photo of her family\u2019s holiday feast for an exercise about traditions at Thanksgiving.\n\nWhen Byers noticed one girl wasn\u2019t participating, she asked her why. The girl explained that her family doesn\u2019t do anything over the holidays.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have Thanksgiving dinner?\u201d Byers asked.\n\nThe girl looked at her. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a table,\u201d she said.\n\nByers never forgot that response. When she came to Washington in 2012 and learned about its community school framework, Byers grasped its potential and jumped on board.\n\nSneezes and marshmallows\n\nEven in the rain and snow, the grounds of Washington became a gathering place for unsupervised children, sometimes an hour before doors opened at 8:15 a.m.\n\nNo longer.\n\nThe Boys & Girls Club responded to the safety concern last year with a free, before-school program called Wake-Up Washington. About 27 to 30 kids attend.\n\nIt\u2019s an example of how a community school makes a difference.\n\nStarting at 7:30 a.m., the kids enter a side door where Lori Pagan, program supervisor, greets them with hand slaps and happy talk.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking them about their day. They talk to us about their issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood morning, Sunshine,\u201d said Pagan as one student entered on a recent Thursday. To another, she said, \u201cLook at you, awesome person. Always stylin\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe Boys & Girls Club chose science and technology as the program\u2019s focus. There\u2019s nothing ho-hum about it.\n\nOn a recent morning, staffer Addy Mathias led seven girls in investigating how a sneeze disperses germs. The girls emitted fake sneezes that showered the floor with a riot of shredded paper. Then they went outside with balloons containing trickles of food coloring. Screams ensued when they popped the balloons, sprinkling themselves with fine droplets.\n\nElsewhere, staffer Ray Smith-Chant, working with a group of 14, talked about the five senses and lobes of the brain. His prop was a sack of marshmallows that didn\u2019t last long.\n\nWhat lobe relates to sight? Smith-Chant asked.\n\n\u201cOccipital,\u201d said Gregory Medina, 10.\n\n\u201cMy man!\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s up!\u201d\n\nFor the Halloween season Smith-Chant plans hands-on lessons about blood and the cardio-respiratory system.\n\nBut Smith-Chant said engaging STEM projects is only part of why kids come back each morning.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s also the relationships we form,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re asking them about their day. They talk to us about their issues.\u201d\n\nHealth needs\n\nMeanwhile, other in-house programs help meet the health needs of Washington students.\n\nTeresa Weitz, a physician assistant with Lancaster General Health, sees children for minor conditions three days a week, saving them a trip to the doctor and minimizing lost class time.\n\nSimilarly, two counselors from T.W. Ponessa & Associates are in the school five days a week to see students. And Conestoga Eye runs a monthly clinic, providing free exams and glasses.\n\nIn addition, Washington families benefit from other supports:\n\n\u2014 Lancaster Recreation Commission provides fee-based before- and after-school child care.\n\n\u2014 Power Packs Project weekly hands out ingredients for a complete meal to 35 families.\n\n\u2014 Lancaster-Lebanon Intermediate Unit 13 offers Free English language instruction for adults four mornings a week.\n\nParents appreciate the programs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so convenient,\u201d Rebeca Aviles said of the health clinic.\n\nWhen her 6-year-old daughter, Ketzia, came down with a sore throat and slight fever, the physician assistant saw her and spared Aviles a trip to the pediatrician and lost hours at work.\n\nBut the anecdotal evidence that these programs are helpful collides with the reality that most of Washington\u2019s students struggle academically.\n\nState data show that, year after year, well over half of third, fourth and fifth graders are testing below grade level in reading, math and science.\n\nAnd the school\u2019s own testing shows many 5-year-olds are already behind their peers when they enter kindergarten.\n\nThe question for Principal Wiercinski and Perez, the community school director, was could the community school become a tool for closing the achievement gap?\n\n\u201cYeah, we can get kids what they need, but how else can a community school impact instruction, because that\u2019s why we\u2019re a school,\u201d Perez said.\n\nToddler outreach\n\nWiercinski, now in her third year as principal, recognized that for her K-5 school to be successful, it needed to influence the growth and development of infants and toddlers who were future Washington students.\n\nAnd so the community school headed down a new avenue known nationally as prenatal- to third-grade, or P-3 for short.\n\nResearch backs up the value of working with vulnerable families as early as possible \u2014 even before the mother gives birth \u2014 and of sustaining support until the youngest child finishes third grade.\n\nA family development specialist will this month begin visiting up to 20 Washington parents who also have preschoolers or infants. Once or twice a month, she\u2019ll mentor them in child development and literacy skills.\n\nThe specialist will be based at Washington but work for Parents As Teachers, run by Community Action Partnership. United Way is funding the position for three years.\n\nThe community school framework supports academic growth in other ways as well.\n\nOver the summer, students and parents came twice a week for Books on Break, a two-hour program in the library that featured story time, lunch and a book to add to home libraries.\n\nAnd six Saturdays this school year, Washington will host Unplug and Play, an hourlong gym program for ages 1 to 8 and their parents.\n\nWill efforts like these move the academic needle? The jury\u2019s out.\n\nThe principal recognized that for her K-5 school to be successful, it needed to influence the growth and development of infants and toddlers who were future Washington students.\n\n\u201cBecause a child went to a community school, we can\u2019t guarantee they will graduate from college,\u201d said Erin Conahan, coordinator for family, school and community partnerships at School District of Lancaster. \u201cBut by having schools that are safe and engaging places for kids and families, they are showing up. They are able to get their social and emotional needs met.\u201d\n\nConahan said Lancaster could have more community schools if lead agencies came forward, committing to the concept and funding. At present, the district splits the $120,000 cost for each of six community school with the Boys Club and two other lead agencies. The district has yet to fund Price Elementary\u2019s community school the Boys Club is developing.\n\nIn the Lehigh Valley, Conahan noted, Lehigh University, United Way and the Bethlehem company that makes Peeps candy teamed up to create a community school at a middle school. Conahan would like to see similar corporate/higher-education partnerships increase the number of community schools here.\n\nPositive relationships\n\nLinda Hernandez said Washington has come a long way since she started teaching art there in 1999.\n\nShe recalls a time when the school struggled to earn the parents\u2019 trust.\n\n\u201cWe had to work, work, work to build bridges (to parents) to get through the school year, and basically start over in September every year,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cBut now the kids and parents look forward to being in our building, and (they) see us when they have a problem.\u201d\n\nLisa Wood, another teacher, thinks the success comes from the school conveying to parents that all are in this together.\n\n\u201cThey all know my name. And that feels great. That makes me feel like somebody.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt takes both home and school to give the child what they need to thrive and learn,\u201d Wood said.\n\nNearly 40 parents turned out on a recent Thursday for breakfast in the library. Teacher Bianca Palmer spoke about how to help children manage emotions and develop empathy and positive relationships. It was a topic parents had suggested for one of the monthly get-togethers.\n\nEach parent went home with a blank refrigerator magnet on which they were to write encouraging messages to their children.\n\n\u201cI just love the fact that they make you feel like family here,\u201d said Tamisha Rodriguez, 33, whose son, Elijah, 10, and daughter, Serenity, 7, are Washington students. \u201cThey all know my name. And that feels great. That makes me feel like somebody.\u201d\n\nAnacelis Solis Padilla, 43, said her son, Yadriel DeJesus, a second grader, never wants to miss school.\n\n\u201cFor me, this is not a school,\u201d Solis Padilla said. \u201cIt\u2019s a second home for my kids.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2ChYmoe\n\n___\n\nInformation from: LNP, http://lancasteronline.com", "In this undated photo, Ammon Bundy receives a call from a former fellow inmate while picking Gypsy Lust apples in his orchard in Emmett, Idaho. Bundy calls himself a \"sunlight kind of guy.\" Before his family's infamous standoffs near Bunkerville, Nevada, and Burns, Oregon, he was living in the dark, he told the Idaho Statesman. Now he's got a new view on life that he's eager to share, he said, and some Idahoans are eager to listen. (Kelsey Grey/Idaho Statesman via AP)\n\nEMMETT, Idaho (AP) \u2014 The first sign that you\u2019ve arrived at the Bundy family\u2019s Emmett home is a poster board affixed to the fence in front of a small apple orchard. Scrawled in Sharpie is the phrase, \u201cSunlight is the best disinfectant. \u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a motto of sorts. Ammon Bundy calls himself a \u201csunlight kind of guy.\u201d Before his family\u2019s infamous standoffs near Bunkerville, Nevada, and Burns, Oregon, he was living in the dark, he told the Idaho Statesman . Now he\u2019s got a new view on life that he\u2019s eager to share, he said, and some Idahoans are eager to listen.\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly three years since Bundy, 43, led a group of protesters to occupy the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge \u2014 first in protest of the government\u2019s treatment of a fellow ranching family, then in protest of federal land ownership.\n\nIt\u2019s been 11 months since his charges for his family\u2019s 2014 confrontation with federal agents on their Nevada ranch over cattle grazing ended in a mistrial. The judge ruled prosecutors committed \u201cgross misconduct\u201d when they withheld evidence from the defense.\n\nBundy said his priority now is spending time with his wife and six children. But remnants of the standoffs still bubble up each day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll always get someone that calls me,\u201d Bundy said at his home in mid-October, after catching up with a friend calling from federal prison. \u201cLife has never, ever been the same \u2014 in a good and a hard way. I think it\u2019ll take years and years to kind of dissolve.\u201d\n\nAnd in many ways, he doesn\u2019t want it to dissolve. Bundy accepts speaking engagements across the West at conferences and rallies that touch on gun rights, environmentalism and agriculture \u2014 some of them controversial. He often tells the stories of the standoffs and the subsequent trials. And, of course, he advocates the view that has come to be synonymous with the Bundy family: that the federal government has no authority to own or manage land in the states.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say he\u2019s anti-government, Bundy said. He reached out to the Statesman in September to dispute that characterization in an article on a local Second Amendment rally.\n\n\u201cI believe that we have to have government,\u201d Bundy said. \u201cI believe that it has to be accountable, and it has to be limited, and it has to be for the purpose of protecting the individual. Otherwise there\u2019s no need for it, and actually becomes more destructive than not having it in the first place.\u201d\n\nBundy espoused some variation of these principles in Bunkerville and Burns. Now he takes the message to Utah, Montana, Idaho. At an April stop in Modesto, California, Bundy called the state\u2019s well-documented water issues \u201ca lie,\u201d claimed ice from asteroids replenishes the Earth\u2019s water and said environmentalists are out to \u201centirely destroy the happiness of human life,\u201d the Modesto Bee reported.\n\n\u201cMy only goal in speaking is to give people a choice,\u201d Bundy told the Statesman.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t feel like he had a choice \u2014 not \u201cwhen you see an army come against your family.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt pushes you to do something,\u201d Bundy said.\n\nAnd when faced with the choice to stand against the federal government, Bundy said he\u2019d do it again.\n\n\u201cWhen a circumstance comes up, I believe that you\u2019ll know and feel whether it\u2019s time to stand or not. There is proof that saying no and meaning no (works). So if it comes to that, I\u2019ll keep making that stand. Because that\u2019s how I believe things are really changed,\u201d he said.\n\nBundy points to Martin Luther King Jr. and to Rosa Parks, both arrested in the pursuit of civil rights.\n\n\u201cThat is the way you change government,\u201d Bundy said.\n\n___\n\nMAKING A MOVEMENT\n\nThe Bundys have become the latest face of a movement that traces back to the Sagebrush Rebellion of the 1970s. But Ammon Bundy said he never meant for that to happen. That\u2019s despite calling others to the Malheur Refuge through the Bundy Ranch website. And, it\u2019s despite counseling other ranchers \u2014 like the Hammond family, whose imprisonment was at the center of the Malheur standoff \u2014 to stand their ground when the federal government comes knocking.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t wanted to say I\u2019m creating a movement or my family\u2019s creating a movement. It was really just an effort to survive,\u201d Bundy said.\n\nBut that\u2019s how many others in Idaho see it \u2014 supporters and critics alike.\n\nMike Stickler is a Nevada consultant who was convicted of fraud and met Cliven Bundy in prison. Stickler wrote a book on the Bundys\u2019 experience in Bunkerville, where federal agents tried to round up Cliven Bundy\u2019s cattle after he refused to pay fees for grazing them on federal land \u2014 to the tune of about $1 million, his lawyer estimated last year in an interview with the Las Vegas Sun.\n\nMarket research conducted by Stickler\u2019s publisher for \u201cCliven Bundy: American Patriot\u201d estimated those sympathetic with the family number around 500,000 nationwide. Stickler believes that number is growing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s Bundy fans and there\u2019s Bundy haters,\u201d Stickler said. \u201cThen there\u2019s this vast middle that just doesn\u2019t know much about them.\u201d\n\nThe Bundys\u2019 \u201cfans\u201d are fanatic. They\u2019re savvy on the details. At an October stop in Marsing on Stickler\u2019s book tour, the 30-plus attendees readily jumped into the discussion to talk trials, sentences and standoffs. Some of them witnessed it firsthand.\n\n\u201cI went up to (Malheur) to be peaceful, not to get into a gun battle,\u201d said Robert Jones after Stickler\u2019s presentation ended. \u201cNow everything has changed.\u201d\n\nJones said all his misconceptions of the protesters operating a \u201ccrazy militia\u201d went out the window during his visit. The Bundys, he said, understood the frustrations he\u2019d always had with government entities.\n\n\u201cI would say that you have a movement among the people in the Northwest who feel disenfranchised,\u201d said Kevin Miller, a friend of Ammon\u2019s and a conservative talk show host on Boise\u2019s 580 KIDO.\n\n\u201cTheir story resonates with the self-reliance (Idahoans have). Many people have dealt with the (Bureau of Land Management) and want to stand up like Cliven did,\u201d Miller said.\n\nErik Molvar, director of grazing watchdog Western Watersheds Project, said some ranchers are following in Cliven Bundy\u2019s footsteps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the Bundys. Trespass grazing is becoming increasingly relevant across the West, and the federal government is doing precious little to enforce the terms of its agreements with ranchers,\u201d Molvar said.\n\nThe outcome of the Bundys\u2019 trials, he said, \u201cmake others feel that there is a lack of enforcement out there, and that\u2019s problematic.\u201d\n\n___\n\nPOLARIZING PRINCIPLES\n\nThe Bundy family\u2019s core view of federal land ownership has been rejected multiple times in U.S. courts. But it resonates with certain Idahoans already worried about government overreach.\n\n\u201cI think our government has gotten so far away from its purpose in every aspect of our lives,\u201d said Thelma Davis, a family friend of the Bundys who now lives in Caldwell. Davis attended Stickler\u2019s Marsing book tour date and later spoke to the Statesman via phone.\n\n\u201cEverything we start to do (on our land), the government tells us we can\u2019t do it. You own the land, but the government controls it,\u201d Davis said.\n\nMarlene Moore, of Marsing, also attended Stickler\u2019s talk. In a phone interview, she said she backs the Bundys completely. In an interview that referenced a long-running conspiracy theory involving the U.N., Moore said she worries private land will be seized by the government and rural Idahoans will be slowly pushed toward urban centers.\n\n\u201cThe government, the BLM think they own these lands, and they don\u2019t,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIf we allow the government to continue in this manner, it\u2019s going to affect all property.\u201d\n\nFederal skepticism is a bedrock of Idaho politics, but most don\u2019t follow it to the extent the Bundys do.\n\nWhile in Congress, current Gov. Butch Otter regularly resisted new Idaho wilderness proposals. But as governor, he\u2019s opposed transferring Idaho\u2019s federal lands to state ownership and has recently supported collaborating with the Forest Service and other agencies on lands issues.\n\n\u201cIf you are not going to obey the rule of law, then you can\u2019t expect the rule of law to work for you,\u201d he told the Statesman while Bundy still held the Malheur refuge in January 2016.\n\nStickler, however, said he believes those who don\u2019t accept the Bundys\u2019 views on the law can still find common ground.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t agree with their constitutional stand, that\u2019s fine. But you should be upset about what (law enforcement and prosecutors) did to them,\u201d he said, referencing the misconduct during the Bunkerville trial.\n\nSome Idaho lawmakers were. Last fall, U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador warned Attorney General Jeff Sessions of a possible \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d in a letter about the treatment of Ammon Bundy and three other Idahoans connected to Bunkerville. His letter came on the heels of a similar one authored by state Rep. Dorothy Moon, R-Stanley, and signed by dozens of members of the Idaho Legislature.\n\nThose signatures included Rep. Christy Perry, R-Nampa, who lost a bid this spring to replace Labrador in Congress. \u201cI don\u2019t agree or disagree with what they did. But I look at the interactions between government and its people and I see a growing disconnect,\u201d she said in a phone interview Oct. 29.\n\nShe called the standoffs \u201cthis unwillingness on both sides to come to the table to address the issues\u201d but said the blame \u201clies squarely in the government\u2019s hands by not being in touch with people, and not being transparent and accountable.\u201d\n\nIn a phone interview, Moon recounted the botched prosecution that led to a mistrial on the Bunkerville charges.\n\n\u201cI think people who have researched and followed the court proceedings are sympathetic to the Bundys,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s making criminals out of people who aren\u2019t criminals.\u201d\n\nBackcountry Hunters & Anglers doesn\u2019t see it that way. The 20,000-member organization, which held its annual rendezvous in Boise in April, strongly rejects the Bundys\u2019 arguments and helped protest a Montana visit by Cliven Bundy in January.\n\n\u201cI grew up on a ranch,\u201d Ryan Busse, the organization\u2019s national board chairman, said in a press release about the protest. \u201cWhen someone stole things or grazed cattle on a place they did not have permission, we called them thieves.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people would see (the mistrial) as a proclamation that the Bundys are right,\u201d Josh Kuntz, regional director for the group\u2019s Idaho chapter, told the Statesman on Wednesday. \u201cBut there are legal reasons that it\u2019s declared a mistrial.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTHE \u2018RIGHT WAY\u2019 TO DO THINGS\n\nAmmon Bundy knows the standoffs likely lost his family some supporters, that the method wasn\u2019t a perfect means of getting the message out. But he said he sees both incidents as necessary and the outcomes of both trials as victories, confirmation of the innocence he and his fellow protesters claimed all along. Further, he said, he can\u2019t take his complaints about a corrupt government to a courtroom and judge he views as equally corrupt.\n\n\u201cThe Bundys may feel that they did (things) civilly. I think that was an escalated conflict. But it\u2019s difficult, and that is a perspective that is certainly subjective,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree with the way they went about it, but I don\u2019t fault them for their choice.\u201d\n\nShe said their frustration is something she hears from her own constituents, a feeling that the government is shirking its responsibility to work for its people. They\u2019re the people who champion the Bundys\u2019 decision to \u201csay no,\u201d as Ammon puts it.\n\nEven other ranchers have criticized the Bundy family\u2019s methods. In 2016, then-leader of the Idaho Cattle Association Wayne Prescott told KTVB he believed the refuge occupiers had some good points \u2014 but their \u201ctakeover of buildings at the wildlife refuge is not representative of our ranching community.\u201d\n\n\u201cEighty percent of the people (who support them) share the view that the Bundys are heroes. The vocal 20 percent believe they should\u2019ve gone through the process (before the standoffs),\u201d KIDO\u2019s Miller said.\n\nKuntz said supporters themselves are just a small, vocal minority in the West. But he worries about the makeup of the group.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s concerning to see some Idaho legislators support (the Bundys\u2019 stance) when evidence shows people are happy with the current (land management) system,\u201d Kuntz said.\n\nStill, he thinks the standoffs have done more good than harm when it comes to public lands policy.\n\n\u201cDue to the publicity, it helped the public understand what they have. A lot of people may have been taking (public lands) for granted, so this can remind them there are people who would try to strip that away,\u201d Kuntz said.\n\n___\n\nANOTHER STANDOFF - THIS TIME, OF IDEAS\n\nAmmon Bundy said Kuntz\u2019s interpretation is just another of the misunderstandings he\u2019s tried to combat since the Bunkerville incident.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to almost get calloused to people just not understanding, because there hasn\u2019t been a whole lot better way (to explain it),\u201d Bundy said. \u201cEither they won\u2019t listen, or you just can\u2019t get them (that much) information. I think that if intelligent people would look at the situation and put aside their biases for just a little bit, they would see the true danger not only to us and the agricultural community, but also to them.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why he thinks education is his way to propel the \u201cnon-movement\u201d forward and avoid the what he sees as the true danger to the American people: federal overreach. (His brother Ryan, another main figure in both standoffs, is running for governor of Nevada as his part. Recent polls quoted in news media show him far from the lead.)\n\nIn addition to speaking engagements, Ammon Bundy has thought about social media as a tool, pointing to the millions of views on the Bundy Ranch Facebook page and protesters\u2019 YouTube accounts during the Malheur occupation. It\u2019s one means of getting word out directly to skeptics, but Molvar isn\u2019t sure that will help the Bundys\u2019 cause.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Bundys are misunderstood at all. If anything, I think people understand the Bundys all too well,\u201d he said.\n\nEven with frustrated Westerners on his side and new avenues through which to share his views, Bundy may find himself in another standoff \u2014 an intellectual one, where he and his family refuse to budge on their interpretation of the Constitution and many Americans refuse to consider it as a valid viewpoint.\n\n\u201cJust because I believe I have the right to do something doesn\u2019t mean that I do,\u201d Kuntz said.\n\nBundy said he\u2019s confident that people can come to understand him as long as he shines a light on his experiences and lets everything be seen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine with what people conclude, but now when their conclusions are made without the proper information. You can\u2019t force people to love you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t force people to even like you.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Idaho Statesman, http://www.idahostatesman.com", "DELRAY BEACH, Fla.

In August, U.S. Geological Survey researchers found a small number of snakes contained DNA from Indian pythons, a closely related species that prefer higher ground and could lead the snakes to inhabit a more varied landscape as they evolve. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee, File)\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 Fueled by bountiful swamps that provide a steady supply of marsh rabbits, deer, wading birds and other meals, Burmese pythons in Florida have rapidly adapted to become hardier and more resistant to cold than their Asian cousins, a new study has found.\n\nAnd that supercharged evolution should serve as a warning not just for Florida, but the entire U.S.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve used pythons in southeast Asia to say where they can live in the U.S. Our data doesn\u2019t say they can expand to New York. But our data says holy sh-t, you gotta keep an eye on this,\u201d said co-author Todd Castoe, whose Arlington lab at the University of Texas led the research that examined the swift genetic changes published in the journal Molecular Ecology.\n\nAlthough they found no direct evidence, the findings also point to another worrisome possibility: more active Florida snakes capable of growing bigger faster, and making more babies.\n\n\u201cWe would only assume this shift would make them more efficient. And it would seem that would leave extra energy on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the perspective of a snake the results are pretty obvious: you grow and reproduce.\u201d\n\nThe study is the latest to conclude Florida\u2019s invasive pythons might be undergoing physiological changes that could allow the swamp-loving constrictors to become a bigger problem for Florida, which has been plundered by invasive species as contentious as Old World climbing fern and ubiquitous as iguanas. In August, U.S. Geological Survey researchers found a small number of snakes contained DNA from Indian pythons, a closely related species that prefer higher ground and could lead the snakes to inhabit a more varied landscape as they evolve.\n\nIn their home territory, Burmese pythons have evolved in a harsh monsoon climate and eat accordingly: they feast during the plentiful rainy season and fast the rest of the year. During that prolonged fasting, the snakes dramatically slow their metabolism to conserve energy. Organs shrivel. They stop producing stomach acids. Their bodies shed what they don\u2019t need.\n\n\u201cThey not only turn the idle way down, but they literally kill off tissue,\u201d Castoe said.\n\nWhen they resume eating, they regenerate quickly, increasing the mass of their heart, liver, kidney and other organs and ramping up their metabolism rate by as much as 40 times higher in just 48 hours.\n\nThat remarkable transformation is what initially intrigued researchers in Castoe\u2019s lab, who were looking for ways to treat human diseases related to metabolism. The snakes were among the first to have their DNA completely sequenced and annotated in 2013, which also found that changes in some genes could be tied to the same ones that play a role in breast cancer, melanomas and childhood leukemia.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s their hallmark and why they\u2019re so cool as a lab rat, except that Florida pythons don\u2019t seem to do it,\u201d Castoe said.\n\nInstead, Florida pythons never shut down, even when they\u2019re forced to fast. That discovery was made inadvertently after the 2010 freeze. Even as they searched for clues to human diseases, Castoe said researchers were well aware of the python\u2019s toll on South Florida\u2019s Everglades, where the snakes have been blamed for driving down the population of small mammals, taking over as top predator and shifting the balance in a swamp that is vast but also vulnerable to small changes.\n\nAfter the freeze, reports started coming in that between 40 and 90 percent of pythons were found dead.\n\n\u201cTo us, as evolutionary biologist, that was a trigger to say hmmm, that looks like extremely strong selection. I wonder if there\u2019s something related to freeze tolerance,\u201d Castoe said.\n\nSo the researchers started examining genes in 97 snakes. Just under 50 were collected before the freeze, between May 2003 and June 2009. Another 49 were found between October 2012 and December 2013. They also looked at five years worth of data on stomach contents between 2003 and 2008 and found that no matter when the snakes were caught, they frequently had food in their guts.\n\n\u201cThose things looked like conveyor belts,\u201d he said. \u201cAll year long they\u2019re absolutely full of food.\u201d\n\nIn sorting through the genes, researchers found that almost all remained the same in snakes captured before and after the freeze. But a small sequence of genes that determine the snakes\u2019 metabolism and, at least in mice, influences how they respond to cold, had changed. The researchers also put their lab snakes on a fast to see if they began to atrophy without food like their Burmese cousins.\n\nIn fact, the Florida snakes kept metabolizing. And generating heat, leading researchers to conclude the snakes that survived the freeze had likely been on the leading edge of a Florida python evolution.\n\nCastoe said wildlife managers will likely need to rethink how they manage the snakes. With a higher threshold for cold weather, they may no longer be bound by South Florida\u2019s steamy temperatures.\n\nAnecdotally, there may be some proof they\u2019re already pushing north. The vast majority of pythons continue to be found in South Florida marshes, where Florida has hired trained hunters to catch them after confirming a breeding population in South Florida, including the Keys. But more than a few dozen have been found further north.\n\nWhile an expansion could be the most obvious bad news, Castoe said the study shed light on what could be a more troubling characteristic of the Florida python: their ability to evolve so rapidly.\n\nThe snakes first appeared in marshes in the 1980s, likely escapees from a South Dade breeding facility or freed pets. By the mid 1990s, they had become full-time residents. That means in less than three decades they changed to suit their new habitat. The speed hasn\u2019t set a new record. The Galapagos finches that first inspired Darwin\u2019s theory are a classic example of more rapid evolution. But it\u2019s close.\n\nTo have a few years of cold and see the genetic adaptation occur is pretty impressive.\u201d said Maggie Hunter, a USGS geneticist Margaret Hunter, who co-authored the study and was lead author on the Indian python report.\n\nWhether female snakes in Florida are reproducing more quickly also remains to be seen, said USGS ecologist Kristen Hart, who has documented the snakes changing habits in the Everglades.\n\n\u201cWe are putting these basic vital rates together little by little, but it is not really known what proportion of females reproduce in back to back years,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nIt also signals the need to pay attention for other potential changes as the snakes adapt, and ignoring how the snakes\u2019 ancestors behaved.\n\n\u201cYou think you\u2019re dealing with a Burmese python and use the rules from a Burmese python in Burma to understand what this population is going to do,\u201d Casteo said. \u201cThis is a whole different animal and that basically means incorporating evolution in our scenario for how this is going to work.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Miami Herald, http://www.herald.com", "FILE - In this Nov. 6, 1998 file photo, Steve and Sheila Clifton, the parents of 8-year-old Madlyn \"Maddie\" Rae Clifton, hold a news conference in the neighborhood where they live and where Maddie disappeared in Jacksonville, Fla. Joshua Phillips was found guilty of first-degree murder of Maddie Clifton. (Hope Kinchen/The Florida Times-Union via AP)\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 She\u2019d pull four plates, four forks and four knives from the cupboard and then it would hit her: There were only three in the family now.\n\nJessie Clifton was 11 when in 1998 her 8-year-old sister, Maddie, whom she considered to be her very best friend, seemingly vanished from the suburban Jacksonville neighborhood they grew up in. From that moment on, no one\u2019s life in the Clifton family would be the same.\n\nThree years later when Jessie was 14, she finally mastered pulling plates and silverware in groups of three. But then her mother, Sheila Clifton, haunted by the home across the street, moved out. Then it was just the two of them: Steve Clifton and his daughter Jessie.\n\nThe years that immediately followed 1998 are largely gone from Jessie Clifton\u2019s memory. Not gone are the chilling details \u2014 faces, expressions, sounds, actions, feelings of what was unfolding within the family, within the Lakewood neighborhood starting on that Nov. 3 evening when Maddie didn\u2019t join the family at the dinner table.\n\n\u201cIt almost starts to feel like a really bad dream until I go home and the little things remind me,\u201d Jessie Clifton said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you start to forget what your life was like because it was so long ago.\u201d\n\nMaddie\u2019s story, the story of a missing girl, brought Jacksonville to its knees.\n\nIt was Election Day and Sheila Clifton came home from voting when her youngest daughter vaulted from the house promising to be home in time for supper. Maddie was seen hitting golf balls down the street then she headed home to round up some more balls.\n\nThat was the last time she was seen.\n\nHundreds of volunteers rooted through Jacksonville, passing out thousands of flyers with the hopes of finding a girl named Maddie Clifton.\n\nMaddie resonated with people. She could have been anyone\u2019s child. A little girl with a freckle-dotted face. A little girl who played piano and pick-up basketball like nobody\u2019s business. She had a zest for life and a heart for the underdog.\n\nWhen watching a TV show, she\u2019d root for scary people or scary things because she didn\u2019t like the idea of people or things feeling lonely or being isolated, her sister said.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why Maddie went across the street where an awkward and somewhat isolated boy lived.\n\nThe first seven days of Maddie\u2019s disappearance was like a three-ring circus. The activity in the community was nonstop: Cops, reporters and hundreds of people descended on the lives of the Cliftons, all in the name of finding Maddie. Even National Guard troops were called to walk through the sewer system looking for signs of the missing girl.\n\nOn Nov. 10, Maddie\u2019s parents had just finished taping an interview with a national news morning program when neighbor Missy Phillips ran across the street to find a police officer. Phillips found Maddie\u2019s body entombed inside the frame of her 14-year-old son\u2019s waterbed. Maddie\u2019s body was partially clothed; she had been beaten with a baseball bat and stabbed multiple times.\n\nAs police went to a middle school and arrested Joshua Earl Patrick Phillips that day, parents at Maddie\u2019s San Jose Catholic School raced there to take their children home early. Children were seen sobbing as they clung to their parents and headed for home.\n\nJosh told police Maddie came over to play baseball and that he accidentally hit her in the head with a ball. He said when she wouldn\u2019t stop crying, he dragged her in the house. He said he was afraid of what his father, an alcoholic with a violent temper, would do if he found out he had been playing with someone, something he said he wasn\u2019t allowed to do when his parents weren\u2019t home.\n\nJosh slept on that waterbed for the next seven nights as Maddie\u2019s body began to waste away. He later told the Times-Union that he told himself nothing happened to her so much that he began to believe it. So he joined hundreds of others and searched for Maddie during those seven days two decades ago.\n\nChurches across Jacksonville opened their doors for a community \u2014 who largely never met Maddie \u2014 to come together and grieve in 1998. At one service, Jessie Clifton addressed the congregation and asked God to forgive her for pleading with him to bring her sister back.\n\nThe following day, some 1,400 people poured into the same Catholic church on San Jose Boulevard where Maddie made her First Communion, but this time it was for the little girl\u2019s funeral. Maddie\u2019s small casket was placed at the center of the altar, covered in a cream-colored cloth. Nearby was a photo of the little girl with the Kool-Aid smile. A heart-shaped flower arrangement from Maddie\u2019s third-grade class also stood nearby. Outside, thousands lined the streets.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 1998, a grand jury returned a first-degree murder charge against Josh Phillips.\n\n\u201cThe citizens of Jacksonville should be assured every appropriate resource in my office will be devoted to making sure Maddie Clifton\u2019s murderer is brought to justice,\u201d State Attorney Harry Shorstein said at a news conference. \u201cThe murder of this little girl has shaken me just as it has the rest of our community.\u201d\n\nJosh was going to be tried as an adult and the Maddie Clifton story again became national news.\n\nA conviction of first-degree murder at the time was an automatic life sentence for a boy, too young to be executed by the state.\n\nA tall, curly-haired boy entered the courtroom the following year. Prior to the murder charge, he had never been in trouble. He was a boy who liked computers and his dog, a beagle.\n\n\u201cThis was a devastating murder that will forever be in the memories of anyone in Jacksonville at the time,\u201d said retired veteran prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda. \u201cHistorically it was one of the most horrific murders, there is no doubt about that. ... Everyone was talking about it. When you\u2019ve got a missing girl, and this missing girl turns out to be dead, I don\u2019t think there was anyone who didn\u2019t know about this or who wasn\u2019t praying for her or attempting to find her.\u201d\n\nBecause of all that and all the pre-trial publicity, the trial was moved out of Jacksonville.\n\nDuring the trial, the boy\u2019s attorney called no witnesses. Josh was found guilty of first-degree murder and was sent away to spend the rest of his life behind bars. He would later get the same punishment at a new sentencing last year when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional to automatically sentence youthful offenders to life.\n\nMaddie\u2019s story didn\u2019t end in 1999 when Josh was shipped off to prison. The lives of those associated with him and with Maddie continued to veer off course.\n\nThe day Maddie was found under Josh\u2019s waterbed was the day Jessie Clifton began to lose her identity. She was a nerdy kid growing up and didn\u2019t hang around with the popular kids.\n\n\u201cI was never the cool kid in school and was made fun of,\u201d she said. \u201cI was the geek.\u201d\n\nBut suddenly with the death of her sister, everyone, it seemed wanted to know her. It bothered her, she said, because in her mind, these school kids never cared for her before.\n\nSomething else weighed on her too. She felt as if she was not Jessie Clifton, rather she was now Maddie Clifton\u2019s sister. \u201cThat\u2019s who I became. I wasn\u2019t Jessie,\u201d she said.\n\nA similar thing happened to Missy Phillips, Josh\u2019s mother. Phillips said she tried to withdraw from society as best she could. She split her time between Jacksonville and North Central Florida hoping maybe she could reinvent herself.\n\nFor some reason she thought if she rode her bicycle places, people wouldn\u2019t put the face with the bike rider and therefore she\u2019d go unnoticed.\n\nEventually she did get noticed. In a church where she\u2019d hoped to seek solace.\n\n\u201cAre you Josh\u2019s mother?\u201d asked a stranger who approached her.\n\nPhillips said she thought about lying but then remembered she was in a church.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she told the woman. Bracing for the worse, the unexpected happened when the woman reached out and embraced Phillips.\n\nThings like that, Phillips said, happened more than once. That makes her feel better.\n\nAlso making her feel better is Jessie Clifton\u2019s warmth back then and more recently.\n\nJessie Clifton recalled how Phillips stayed inside after her son was arrested. \u201cShe hated to come outside,\u201d she said.\n\nSo Jessie Clifton helped out. She\u2019d walk the dog and when she\u2019d see Phillips pull in the driveway from the grocery store, she said she\u2019d race out to help her carry the grocery sacks inside.\n\nPhillips sent the family a Christmas card each year.\n\n\u201cShe was such a sweet and kind person, she didn\u2019t deserve what happened,\u201d Jessie Clifton said. \u201d... I feel like she feels everyone was against her. She found Maddie and I cannot even imagine that and then to realize what her son had did. That is a lot for one person to handle.\u201d\n\nThe two of them shared a bond that day in November 1998 when Clifton lost her sister and Phillips lost a son: \u201cA loss is a loss,\u201d Jessie Clifton said.\n\nLives continued to unravel.\n\nMissy Phillips\u2019 husband, Steve Phillips, died in a car crash.\n\nSteve and Sheila Clifton divorced after 25 years of marriage. The couple had known each other in high school and had been together for 30 years.\n\nBut Maddie\u2019s death put an end to the normalcy that the family enjoyed \u2014 a solid family that enjoyed one another, enjoyed fishing trips and vacations.\n\n\u201cEverything stopped when my parents divorced,\u201d Jessie Clifton said.\n\nThey handled the grief differently, with Steve Clifton largely shutting down and Sheila Clifton wanting to talk about it, Jessie Clifton said. But she didn\u2019t think it was a good time to talk with her mother for this story.\n\nSheila Clifton moved into her mother\u2019s house in the same neighborhood allowing her to still be close to her daughter, but away from the Phillips\u2019 home where Maddie died. She then moved to Macclenny where she is today.\n\nSteve Clifton moved out of the house this summer. Jessie still lives there and is in the process of buying it from him.\n\nTo her, it\u2019s a home where many fantastic memories were made before 1998.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been my home,\u201d the 31-year-old said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The (Jacksonville) Florida Times-Union, http://www.jacksonville.com", "Canada goaltender Shannon Szabados stops a U.S. shot during the first period of a Four Nations Cup hockey preliminary game in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018.

It\u2019s a rematch of the Olympic final that the Americans won in South Korea.\n\nSzabados has spent the majority of her hockey career in men\u2019s leagues, starting with exhibition games for WHL\u2019s Tri-City Americans at age 16 to full seasons in the Alberta Junior Hockey League, Alberta Colleges Athletic Conference and the Southern Professional Hockey League.\n\nAny sustained time in the women\u2019s game came in the winters she spent with the Canadian team in Calgary preparing for Olympic Games.\n\nHer physical, personal and geographic needs factored into the Edmonton native signing with the Buffalo Beauts of the five-team National Women\u2019s Hockey League.\n\nLorain, just west of Cleveland, Ohio, is the hometown of her partner Carl Nielsen. It\u2019s where Szabados wanted to move after the Olympics in February.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, the decision was based on him having a good job there,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve had a jewelry store in their family for almost 400 years, so it was important for him to be there.\u201d\n\nNow, she\u2019s become familiar with Interstate 90, and the 435-mile (700-kilometer) round trip from Lorain to Buffalo, New York, that she makes twice a week to play and practice with the Beauts.\n\n\u201cExit 27, that\u2019s my go-to. On the way to Buffalo, there\u2019s a Shell and a Tim Hortons,\u201d she said Thursday at the Four Nations Cup tournament.\n\nKim and Terry Pegula, owners of the NHL\u2019s Buffalo Sabres, purchased the Beauts in 2017.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a huge step for women\u2019s hockey,\u201d Szabados said. \u201cA lot of our staff overlap. Our media staff, one guy puts on his Sabres jacket and then he puts on his Beauts jacket.\n\n\u201cWe get first-class treatment all around as far as facilities and how we\u2019re treated.\u201d\n\nSzabados injured ligaments in her left knee toward the end of her second season with the Columbus Cottonmouths of the Southern Professional Hockey League in 2016.\n\nInjuries also limited her to a handful of games with the Canadian women during their 2017-18 preparation for Pyeongchang.\n\nBut Szabados stopped 40 of 42 shots, including nine in overtime, in the Olympic final. The U.S. prevailed in a six-round shootout to claim gold.\n\nSzabados became tearful after the game while talking about injuries that sidelined her for much of the season. A healthy body that can extend her career is a priority for her now.\n\n\u201cI knew if I wanted to continue ... I didn\u2019t have the healthiest of years last year, so it was important for me to be somewhere where I could be back to being 100 per cent,\u201d Szabados said. \u201cBeing on the ice seven days a week for hours upon hours and getting running over by 200-pound men was probably not the ideal situation for me health-wise. I miss it, but I enjoy where I\u2019m at.\u201d\n\nIn 64 games for Canada, Szabados ranks second all-time in wins (47) and shutouts (17), behind Kim St. Pierre, who has 64 wins and 29 shutouts.\n\nSzabados made 27 and 28 saves in the 2014 and 2010 Olympic women\u2019s finals, respectively, on the way to the gold medal.\n\nShe is the first player from Canada\u2019s national team to play in the NWHL. Szabados is 1-2 for the Beauts this season with a goals-against average of 1.67 and a save percentage of .938.\n\nU.S. women\u2019s team forward Dani Cameranesi and defender Emily Pfalzer are her Beauts teammates.\n\nHow long Szabados will tend net is a year-to-year decision.\n\nShe echoes players in both the NWHL and Canadian Women\u2019s Hockey League in wishing for a merger of the two leagues.\n\n\u201cI think women\u2019s hockey is kind of at an exciting point right now,\u201d Szabados said. \u201cI would regret it if I didn\u2019t stick around to see where it goes.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "FILE - In this July 28, 2018, file photo, Bubba Wallace stands in the garage area during practice for a NASCAR Cup Series auto race in Long Pond, Pa.

(AP) \u2014 Bubba Wallace does not care about the way things used to be done in NASCAR, and he is not interested in how veterans believe he is supposed to drive.\n\nThe rookie behind the wheel of Richard Petty\u2019s iconic No. 43 has already defied odds by becoming the only black driver at NASCAR\u2019s top level. Reaching the pinnacle of the sport is just the start of what Wallace hopes to accomplish.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m different, I\u2019m not like anybody in this sport, and that\u2019s not based on skin color,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cI have an I-don\u2019t-give-a-damn filter, and there are a lot of guys still stuck to an old system that\u2019s been the same thing for them the last 20 years. Well, that\u2019s boring. That\u2019s super boring.\n\n\u201cI do my own thing and think, \u2018Why are we doing it this old way still?\u2019 Throw the old system out the window. People are afraid of change, but I want to change everything.\u201d\n\nWallace has two races remaining in a rookie season with a storybook beginning at the Daytona 500. He finished second, the highest ever for a minority in NASCAR\u2019s version of the Super Bowl, and it launched Wallace into the national spotlight.\n\nBut Daytona is unlike the bulk of NASCAR\u2019s schedule so when the high of Daytona subsided, Wallace found himself trying to keep his head above water. His Richard Petty Motorsports team switched from Ford to Chevrolet during the offseason, aligned with a new team partner and hired a new driver in Wallace. The seat was open because Aric Almirola moved to Stewart-Haas Racing, and primary sponsor Smithfield left with him.\n\nA mid-level team undergoing so much change could not avoid struggling and it\u2019s been that way all year for RPM and its eager young driver. The loss of funding has made it feel as if the team is sometimes running uphill.\n\nWallace heads into Sunday\u2019s race at ISM Raceway near Phoenix ranked 28th in the Cup standings. He has led 19 laps and had two top-10 finishes, but hasn\u2019t been close to a strong finish since Daytona back in February. It\u2019s a slow climb and securing funding remains a top priority for Wallace, who was born in Alabama and grew up in suburban Charlotte, the North Carolina home of most NASCAR teams.\n\n\u201cWe are still trying to do the best we can, the goal is still to try to get more sponsorship for the next two years, at least,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cI don\u2019t know CEOs or company mindsets in how they go about sponsoring, but I\u2019m super competitive and if you only see the results sheet and see how we are running, it\u2019s hard for me to show that there is more to it than that. It becomes a challenge to showcase why we are a better fit for some sponsors and a better fit than other teams.\u201d\n\nThe Air Force is Wallace\u2019s sponsor at Phoenix in honor of Veteran\u2019s Day. The Air Force has partnered with RPM for 10 consecutive seasons and is typically on the car around patriotic holidays.\n\nWallace has made bonding with his sponsors a priority and has visited four different Air Force bases this year. He has participated in various drills and allowed The Associated Press to accompany him to Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina, where he flew in an F-16 with the 77th Fighter Squadron, known as the \u201cGamblers.\u201d He went through flight training before Maj. Gen. Scott Zobrist led him into the air. Captain Jack Howard, a rookie pilot, flew Wallace\u2019s jet, reaching over 9Gs.\n\nIt was an adrenaline rush, even for a driver who has had more than his share of hard crashes this season. Wallace was even disappointed to learn the G forces he and Howard pulled ranked only second on the squadron board for guests.\n\nPushing for the most he can get is the same way Wallace races, and he pointed to a recent race in Dover, Delaware, as an example of how he is an anomaly in NASCAR. Wallace figured he was four laps down in his version of the Dover story during a late restart that put him near the front of the field. Because he wasn\u2019t on the lead lap, Wallace said other drivers believed he should move out of their way.\n\nHe refused.\n\n\u201cAfter the race you hear all these guys complaining, \u2018There goes Bubba racing again,\u2019\u201d Wallace said. \u201cYou are damn right. I am not going to roll over. ... Go race. We aren\u2019t here to ride around and put on a dog and pony show. I am not going to layover for you. If you think I was tough to pass, well, sorry bro, drive harder. I\u2019m going as fast as I can.\u201d\n\nCelebrated for being the rare minority to make it to NASCAR\u2019s big leagues, Wallace recognizes that his race will always be as important to some as the way he races. He has seen Twitter engagement turn nasty because he is black, but is adamant he does not let it bother him. Nor will he use it as a way to differentiate himself from the rest of the field.\n\n\u201cUntil we get more drivers of color, the color of my skin is going to be an issue for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I am Bubba Wallace. I don\u2019t pull the race card. I\u2019ve had some haters on Twitter and I will respond back, and then fans quickly go to the race side. I didn\u2019t mention that \u2014 this was about me running 30th \u2014 you mentioned race. I\u2019m here to win races and be me. If someone doesn\u2019t like me, that\u2019s not my problem.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "", "", "", "People gather outside a coffee shop for a vigil for Sean Adler Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018, in Simi Valley, Calif.

Sri Lanka's President Maithripala Sirisena dissolved Parliament and called for elections on Jan. 5 in a bid to stave off a deepening political crisis over his dismissal of the prime minister that opponents say is unconstitutional. (AP Photo/Eranga Jayawardena)\n\nCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s president has dissolved Parliament and called for elections on Jan. 5 in a bid to stave off a deepening political crisis over his dismissal of the prime minister that opponents say is unconstitutional.\n\nAn official notification signed by President Maithripala Sirisena announced the dissolution of Parliament effective midnight Friday. It said the names of candidates will be called before Nov. 26 and the new Parliament is to convene Jan. 17.\n\nSri Lanka has been in a crisis since Oct. 26, when Sirisena fired his prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and replaced him with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa. Both say they command a majority in Parliament and had been expected to face the 225-member body on Wednesday after it was suspended for about 19 days.\n\nForeign Minister Sarath Amunugama told The Associated Press on Saturday that the president dissolved Parliament due to the need to go to the people to find a resolution to the crisis.\n\nHe said that on Wednesday \u201cthere was to be a lot of commotion and unparliamentary activities sponsored by the speaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe speaker was not planning to act according to the constitution and standing orders of Parliament,\u201d Amunugama said.\n\nSirisena\u2019s supporters had been irked by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya\u2019s announcement that he was going to call for a vote for either party to prove their support.\n\n\u201cThe dissolution clearly indicates that Mr. Sirisena has grossly misjudged and miscalculated the support that he might or could secure to demonstrate support in the Parliament,\u201d said Bharath Gopalaswamy, director at U.S.-based analyst group Atlantic Council\u2019s South Asia Center. \u201cAt the end of the day, he is a victim of his own homegrown crisis.\u201d\n\nWickremesinghe has insisted that his firing is unconstitutional. He has refused to vacate his official residence and demanded that Parliament be summoned immediately to prove he had support among its members.\n\nJayampathy Wickramaratne, one of Sri Lanka\u2019s foremost constitutional law experts and a member of Parliament representing Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Front coalition, said he and other coalition delegates met with the chairman of Sri Lanka\u2019s Election Commission on Saturday and urged him not to take action toward the snap elections decreed by the president on Friday.\n\nWickramaratne said that President Sirisena has cited a general clause in Sri Lanka\u2019s constitution stating that the president has the power to summon or suspend Parliament. But Wickramaratne said a specific clause in the 19th amendment, added in 2015, stipulates that the president can only dissolve Parliament after 4 1/2 years, or earlier if requested by two-thirds of Parliament.\n\n\u201cYou cannot read the constitution in one provision in isolation \u2014 you have to read it as a whole, especially when amendments have been brought,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cbefore the 19th amendment, the president could dissolve Parliament at will after one year. The amendment will have been negated if this absurd argument is allowed to succeed.\u201d\n\nHowever, Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, another constitutional expert and Wickremesinghe\u2019s justice minister who alongside Wickramaratne spearheaded the introduction of the 19th amendment, said the president was empowered to dissolve Parliament to avoid stalemate situations.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to a stalemate situation or a constitutional deadlock, the president is obliged to take measures to avoid a conflict situation and political instability. Therefore, he has been compelled to take this decision and dissolve Parliament and he has the authority to do that,\u201d said Rajapaksa, who is not related to the newly named prime minister.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge Wickremesinghe repeatedly denied.\n\nSirisena was critical of investigations into military personnel accused of human rights violations during Sri Lanka\u2019s long civil war against a Tamil separatist group, which ended in 2009. Rajapaksa, who ruled as president from 2005 to 2015, is considered a hero by the ethnic Sinhalese majority for winning the conflict. But he lost a re-election bid in 2015 amid accusations of nepotism, corruption and wartime atrocities.\n\nWickremesinghe\u2019s camp is likely to contest Sirisena\u2019s move because of constitutional provisions stating a Parliament can\u2019t be dissolved until 4 1/2 years after its election. The current Parliament was elected in August 2015.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally unconstitutional,\u201d said Harsha de Silva, a member of Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Party and a former government minister. \u201cSirisena has relegated the constitution to toilet paper. We will fight this dictator to the end.\u201d\n\nThe party said in a Twitter message that it will meet the elections commissioner to discuss the constitutionality of Sirisena\u2019s move.\n\nThe U.S. State Department tweeted that it is deeply concerned by news that the Sri Lanka Parliament will be dissolved, \u201cfurther deepening the political crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a committed partner of Sri Lanka, we believe democratic institutions and processes need to be respected to ensure stability and prosperity,\u201d the statement said.\n\nEarlier, U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel, the top-ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and two other lawmakers wrote to Sirisena warning that actions circumventing the democratic process could impact U.S. assistance \u2014 including a planned five-year aid package from the Millennium Challenge Corporation worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\u201cWe fear that recent actions, if not corrected, will threaten your country\u2019s democratic development and derail the progress made in recent years,\u201d the three lawmakers said in a letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Krishan Francis in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Emily Schmall in New Delhi and Matthew Pennington in Washington contributed to this report.", "Jaroslaw Kaczynski, center, twin brother of the late Polish President Lech Kaczynski, Polish President Andrzej Duda, left, and Marta Kaczynska, right, daughter of Lech Kaczynski attend the unveiling of a monument dedicated to Lech Kaczynski, who died in a 2010 plane crash, in Warsaw, Poland, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018.

(Tom Stromme /The Bismarck Tribune via AP)\n\nBISMARCK, N.D. (AP) \u2014 Graduation rates for Native American students in North Dakota have lagged behind those of white students by about 20 to 30 percentage points for the past decade.\n\nEight years ago, a local nonprofit sought to change that by starting a program for Native American students, aimed at boosting their academic performances, while also providing them a safe place to go after school.\n\nYouthworks\u2019 New Direction program has shown great success with Native American students in Bismarck-Mandan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really looking to positively impact these young people, and it started because of the graduation rates,\u201d said Mark Heinert, program manager at Youthworks. \u201cBut our reality is this: We\u2019re giving young people the opportunity to have a place they feel comfortable in, where they belong.\u201d\n\nThe New Direction program serves 40 to 50 students each year. Students come from Bismarck High School, South Central High School, Century High School, Legacy High School and Mandan High School.\n\nFor four days a week after school, the students get rides to and from Youthworks, assistance with their homework, help with accessing services in the community and a daily meal, the Bismarck Tribune reported.\n\nThere are program mentors, typically Native American college students, who assist students with schoolwork. The program is a component of the Youth Cultural Achievement Program, which was developed in 2008 to reduce the number of Native American youth entering the juvenile justice system.\n\nStudents are referred to the program by a parent-family liaison at their school, a school counselor or social worker, a parent or a Youthworks staff member. Students in the program often have had adverse experiences in their lives, such as dealing with family issues, are in residential or foster care or have jumped from one school to the next, often resulting in an unstable education.\n\nThe program, funded by Missouri Slope Areawide United Way, has shown positive outcomes. Last year, 78 percent of youth in the program who attended after-school sessions 16 or more times passed their core classes. Seventy-eight percent of students showed academic improvement.\n\nThough the outcomes have been good, the program is more than just providing academic support, said Pauletta Red Willow, coordinator of the Youth Cultural Achievement Program. These students need \u201cconstant reinforcement,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEspecially dealing with the statistics in Bismarck-Mandan for Native youth, like the high rates of juvenile calls for the police, there\u2019s a lot of substance use in our communities,\u201d as well as trauma and loss, Red Willow said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about giving them that sense that, you can do this, and building up their esteem,\u201d Heinert said.\n\nFor Julie Middletent, a sophomore at Legacy, the program has helped her make new friends, in addition to improving her grades. She switched from Bismarck High to Legacy the first semester of her freshman year, because her mother wanted her to attend the same school as her brother.\n\nShe saw her grades improve last year, increasing to As and Bs. She now has more time to get her homework done during the after-school program, and the mentors are helpful.\n\n\u201cI always look forward to coming here, because I get to see everyone from different schools,\u201d the 15-year-old said. \u201cI know everyone here. We\u2019re all friends, almost like family.\u201d\n\nMiddletent said she plans to go to college and get a degree in business and become an accountant to help the tribe in which she\u2019s enrolled, the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com", "In a Tuesday, Oct. 23 2018 photo, Dr. Joseph Swedzinski meets with RN Cindy Genzler before he sees a patient, at the Center for Family Medicine in Sioux Falls.

(AP) \u2014 The University of South Dakota\u2019s first medical residency program started in 1958 with four open spots.\n\nWithout those four spots, Sioux Falls \u2014 and the state as a whole \u2014 likely wouldn\u2019t have the strong medical workforce it boasts today.\n\nIn a word, it\u2019s \u201cpoetic\u201d celebrating the 60th anniversary of the pathology residency, said Nedd Brown, USD\u2019s associate dean of graduate medical education.\n\nIt\u2019s the program that kick-started decades of growth and made South Dakota a destination for medical students who come to learn and stick around to practice. And it started before USD offered a four-year medical school program.\n\nToday, the USD Sanford School of Medicine is one of the top 10 schools in the nation for its local retention rates, and it all started with pathology, the Argus Leader reported.\n\n\u201cThe unique thing about pathology? They see every patient in the hospital,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a child, you have blood drawn. If you\u2019re an elderly person, you have blood drawn and if you\u2019re a pregnant lady, you have blood drawn. Pathology is involved all along the way, so it\u2019s poetic that pathology was the first one and the rest have grown out of that.\u201d\n\nThe pathology residency program only had four spots a year available from 1958 to 2008, Department Chair Michael Koch said. He has been head of the department for the last 15 years, and the program since more than doubled in positions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound corny, but I feel kind of like a proud father,\u201d Koch said about his department\u2019s growth. \u201cIt\u2019s very unique and satisfying to see that development.\u201d\n\nToday, the graduate school receives thousands of residency applications each year for eight different medical fields or about 150 spots scattered between Avera, Sanford and the Veterans Administration medical center, Brown said.\n\nIf a medical student completes a residency in South Dakota, they have an almost 80 percent chance of staying to practice, Brown said. That makes USD\u2019s medical school the sixth in the nation when it comes to local retention, he said.\n\nAnd as of April, the medical school graduates a greater percentage of physicians practicing in rural areas than any of the other 145 medical schools across the nation.\n\n\u201cI know when I or my family have been in to see physicians in this community, invariably we\u2019ll bump into a resident,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s at a clinic or at the hospitals, they\u2019re around, and they\u2019re providing care.\u201d\n\nPediatrics alone, one of the school\u2019s newest residency programs, brought in more than 400 applications for six spots this year, Brown said. The school interviews 10 potential students for every open spot it has, making the only medical school in the state highly competitive, Brown said.\n\nBut what sets the graduate school apart from other medical schools across the nation is how collaborative the school is with its medical partners, Brown said.\n\nIt helps that the school is located in the state\u2019s largest city and often makes for a great economic and educational environment for students\u2019 families to also work in the area, he said.\n\nIf USD was only a medical school without residency spots, the retention rate would drop to 40 percent, Brown said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a powerful factor, just based on the raw numbers, of keeping South Dakotans here in South Dakota to care,\u201d Brown said.\n\nNeither Mark Huntington, the family medicine program director, or third-year resident Joseph Swedzinski are from South Dakota.\n\nBut both came because of the secret to the medical school\u2019s success \u2014 a collaborative, adaptive atmosphere not found elsewhere and a variety of opportunities.\n\nPrior to Huntington joining USD\u2019s residency program in 2006, he practiced in a rural community on the border of Minnesota, he said. He\u2019s been the program\u2019s director for the last five years, and said it was difficult leaving what he loved doing.\n\nBut Huntington couldn\u2019t turn down the opportunity to help eager students become mature physicians, he said.\n\n\u201cSometimes, we have residents who come in and struggle a little bit,\u201d Huntington said. \u201cTo help them achieve something they might not have otherwise, and getting to see their process of discovery and see it through their eyes. ... We learn as much from them as they do from us.\u201d\n\nWhat tipped the balance for Huntington was the faculty\u2019s diversity, and how closely the school worked with local health care systems to give students the chance to explore beyond the basics, he said.\n\n\u201cThe value placed on education here is second to none,\u201d Huntington said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Sanford Health system or an Avera Health system. Both work together to offer education, while many other hospitals and institutions view education as a liability.\u201d\n\nThat educational investment is what drew residents like Swedzinski to the graduate school and what made him want to stay in the area, he said. He did his first years of medical school in Duluth, Minnesota before serving in the family medicine program, he said.\n\n\u201cNo. 1 for me was the mission,\u201d he said. \u201cThis residency is all about training people for practicing in rural environments, and preparing them for that. It trains family docs to have a broad skill set and be able to do full-spectrum family medicine, whereas some programs will train people with a limited skill set.\u201d\n\nBut with his eyes on having a rural practice from the get-go, USD was exactly what he was looking for, he said. When he finishes his residency, he plans to practice in Pierre and eventually do obstetrics, something he said family medicine residency programs don\u2019t often provide a heavy focus in.\n\nAdaptability will be the key for USD\u2019s graduate program to continue shaping South Dakota\u2019s medical workforce another 60 years, said Jennifer Hsu, the internal medicine residency associate program director.\n\n\u201cNobody knows where exactly that medicine is going in another 60 years,\u201d Hsu said. \u201cIt could be completely different, and the approach to medical training could be totally different. Our main challenge is remaining adaptable as new data comes out about how better to train residents, and that we are appropriately adjusting to meet those needs.\u201d\n\nAnd if Brown were to look back six decades at where it all began, all he can think about is how far USD\u2019s graduate program has come and how much potential it still has yet to embrace, he said.\n\n\u201cMy vision would be to continue that philosophy of having physicians who love, love, love to teach, because that\u2019s how they got their skills, and they want to give those skills back to the next generation,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIn the state of South Dakota, we have that in spades.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Argus Leader, http://www.argusleader.com", "MELLETTE, S.D. (AP) \u2014 Cody Carey has been through quite a bit his seven months of life.\n\nHe was born April 4 to Samantha Hommel and Kyle Carey. He will never remember his first home in Mellette.\n\nCody\u2019s baptism was May 27, and the family celebrated at the home. But shortly after the happy occasion, a fire broke out.\n\n\u201cIt was probably 15 to 20 minutes after the last guest had gone home, and an hour later we had completely lost our house,\u201d Hommel said.\n\nThe fire gutted the interior. The family lost pretty much everything. A friend offered a home for rent in Mellette. And the community rallied around them to help, Hommel said by phone last month.\n\nTragedy wouldn\u2019t be a stranger. As they were busy getting their feet back under them after the fire, something gnawed at Hommel about Cody\u2019s development. He was about three months old. He wasn\u2019t hitting certain milestones at the same time his sister, Kenlee Hommel, now 5, had and he wasn\u2019t very active, Aberdeen American News reported.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t eating well at all. He slept a majority of the time. He was spitting up a lot. We thought it was acid reflux. We took him into his doctor, gave him medication and that wasn\u2019t working,\u201d Samantha Hommel said.\n\nIn July, Cody was admitted to Avera St. Luke\u2019s Hospital, and after five days without a conclusion, he was transferred to Sanford Children\u2019s Hospital in Sioux Falls.\n\n\u201cHe had OTC based on his ammonia levels,\u201d Hommel said.\n\nOrnithine transcarbamylase deficiency is a metabolic disorder that affects liver enzymes.\n\nCody was flown to the University of Minnesota in the Twin Cities. His case is rare because he\u2019s of the 25 percent with the already-rare disorder who don\u2019t have a genetic link to it, Hommel said. His liver doesn\u2019t make enough arginine and citrulline to remove proteins, so instead of them being released in urine, they get stored, Hommel explained.\n\nIt was determined Cody would need a liver transplant, and he was discharged Aug. 13 with directions for a protein-restricted diet until a donor can be found. He\u2019s shown some improvement already, and he\u2019s passed the 20-pound mark, which is where the doctors wanted him to be before an operation, his mother said.\n\n\u201cWe are doing (physical therapy) and (occupational therapy) with him currently, helping him do exercises. He\u2019s doing really well now,\u201d Hommel said. \u201cHe rolls from back to tummy and tummy to back really well.\u201d\n\nCody has a status of 1B on the transplant list, which means it could take days or a few months \u2014 but not years \u2014 for a donor liver, she said. After the transplant he should lead a pretty normal life. With a liver \u2014 unlike with a heart or kidney transplant \u2014 Hommel said her son should only need the one operation.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, he\u2019s going to live a pretty normal life. He might have to watch his protein intake a bit. He can play sports but not contact sports,\u201d Hommel said. \u201cHe\u2019d just have his anti- rejection medications for life. If everything goes the way it should and his body doesn\u2019t reject (the new liver), he should have it for life.\u201d\n\nThe community of Mellette pitched in again during the family\u2019s medical travels.

They didn\u2019t torture them, Abu Ammar said, but started threatening to kill them as time passed.\n\nAt least two women and one man died in captivity, including a woman who was shot by the extremists to pressure authorities in negotiations for the captives\u2019 release.\n\nAbu Ammar\u2019s husband said she looked frail.\n\n\u201cSometimes they fed us once every two days and other times twice every day,\u201d Abu Ammar said, adding that it was mostly just olive oil, thyme and jam.\n\n\u201cThey held us first in a camp then a cave and kept moving us from one place to the other,\u201d she said.\n\nAbu Ammar said she didn\u2019t know about the killed hostages until they were liberated.\n\nSix other hostages, two women and four children, had been freed in an exchange with the government in October. Negotiations were expected to free the remaining hostages but talks failed and Syrian troops launched a broad offensive against IS in southern Syria.\n\nSeparately, a war monitoring group and Syrian state media accused the U.S.-led coalition of killing over two dozen civilians in airstrikes in Hajin, a town in southeastern Syria near the border with Iraq, IS\u2019s last stronghold.\n\nSpokesman Col. Sean Ryan told the AP in an email that the U.S.-led coalition \u201csuccessfully struck (and) destroyed\u201d an IS observation post and staging area in Hajin \u201cvoid of civilians at the time.\u201d\n\nRyan said the coalition team in charge of tracking civilians reviews claims of civilian casualties they see in media reports.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 26 persons, believed to be members of IS families, were killed in Hajin and another seven were killed in Shafaa in airstrikes Friday. The Observatory said the dead were mostly Iraqi women and children.\n\nSyria\u2019s state news agency reported 26 killed, quoting locals.\n\nThe Islamic State group posted a rare video from inside Hajin showing badly destroyed homes, bodies protruding from under rubble and dust still rising from some buildings.\n\nThe U.S-led coalition and local allies have been battling IS militants on the eastern banks of the Euphrates River in a small sliver of territory around Hajin.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Sarah El Deeb contributed to this report from Beirut.", "", "", "", "CAIRO, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Ground has been broken on a new veterans memorial.\n\nAbout 100 individuals attended a recent ceremony in Cairo that officially marked the beginning of construction for the project that will honor those who served in the nation\u2019s military.\n\nCairo Veterans Memorial Park project is an undertaking by the Cairo Community Foundation and was sparked by the VanWinkle family.\n\nKirby VanWinkle said his father, Edward, an Army veteran, had tried to get a memorial established in Cairo for a number of years. The ball really got rolling a couple years ago when the foundation got involved.\n\nOriginally, the plan to honor veterans was going to be done by installing a pillar at the community center. That idea grew to create an entire park that will include granite pillars, a wall featuring engraved bricks and a memorial garden on the lot directly east of the Village of Cairo Fire Hall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than what he wanted,\u201d VanWinkle said of his father, who passed away four years ago. \u201cHe just wanted the names recognized on main street somewhere. I\u2019m sure he would be very impressed.\u201d\n\nCharity Adams, executive director of the foundation, said the project grew because of the community support. A committee was formed to develop the project. Many members of the committee are veterans or have family members who served.\n\n\u201cThis park was built 110 percent with veterans in mind. This is not a vanity park. This is for the veterans,\u201d Adams said.\n\nCost of the project was estimated to be about $200,000, but it likely will be less, the Grand Island Independent reported.\n\n\u201cWe have found that with community volunteers that the project is not going to be anywhere near that,\u201d Adams said, adding that the land was donated by the village.\n\nThere are some hard costs for the project. Fundraising efforts are still ongoing to cover those expenses. Donations are being taken and the public can purchase a brick for $150 to dedicate to a veteran. The bricks will be engraved and be part of a 90-foot-long memorial wall.\n\nBricks can be bought by anyone.\n\n\u201cWe want to honor all veterans. It doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re from. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve been to Cairo or are even from Nebraska. If you have a family member who lives in California and you want a brick to honor them, by all means, you can buy a brick,\u201d said Becky Grabowski, a committee member and Army veteran.\n\nAside from brick sales, the project is also being funded through Cairo sales tax revenue, a development fund set up through the Grand Island Community Foundation and other donations.\n\nOther pieces of the memorial park include five granite pillars that cost about $15,000 apiece. Each pillar will have a bronze emblem and be engraved with pictures depicting each branch of the military.\n\nThe center of the park will be a flag pole surrounded by four granite benches. There will also be a pollinator garden with a cement walkway in the shape of a ribbon.\n\nConstruction will be done in phases. The first phase, which all funding has been secured, will likely get started in the spring and includes the memorial wall with a donor recognition section, benches, pollinator garden and basic landscaping.\n\nPhase two includes the granite pillars and a star walkway made up of red, white and blue pavers.\n\nAdams said she knew the community would embrace the project but she was surprised by the turnout for the groundbreaking ceremony.\n\n\u201cI expected them to like it. I expected them to be on board. I knew they wanted it. I did not expect the turn out to be this big,\u201d she said.\n\nRain shifted the program indoors where several veterans and current military members were honored during a pinning ceremony. The group momentarily made it outdoors to the vacant corner lot to watch committee members turn over dirt with golden shovels.\n\nHopes are to have the project complete by next fall, Adams said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Grand Island Independent, http://www.theindependent.com", "In this Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018, photo, Chris and Jaci Uttecht pose for a photo in front of a new church they started called River City Community Church in Chippewa Falls, Wis., which is located in what was formerly The Lodge tavern. (Dan Reiland/The Eau Claire Leader-Telegram via AP)\n\nCHIPPEWA FALLS, Wis. (AP) \u2014 A closed tavern in Chippewa Falls that appeared slated for demolition has been given new life as it has reopened as a church.\n\nRiver City Community Church has leased the building, moving into the building in August that was known as The Lodge for the past decade.\n\nChris and Jaci Uttecht, co-leaders of the church, said their congregation was founded earlier this year with a group of about 20 meeting in their home. It quickly grew, and they began looking for space. They saw a sign on the building that it was available for lease.\n\n\u201cIt had been vacant for 18 months,\u201d Jaci Uttecht told the Leader-Telegram . \u201cIt\u2019s not for sale. We are occupying the space and hope it is a beacon of hope for Chippewa Falls. This space has been a real blessing to us.\u201d\n\nWhen the Uttechts first walked in the building, they had a vision of how it could be transformed into a church. The front bar area was still there; all the bar signs and kegs and taps were gone. There is room in the front area for maybe a dozen tables. However, through a narrow hallway, the building opens up into a banquet hall, which was perfect for creating a church setting.\n\n\u201cWe knew this is what we needed,\u201d Jaci Uttecht said. \u201cBut we knew it needed work.\u201d\n\nFirst, they needed to clean up debris that had sat in the building for a year. Even though it is a relatively new building, it was showing signs of disrepair and neglect.\n\n\u201cWe filled a 30-yard dumpster,\u201d Jaci Uttecht said. \u201cWe did a lot of work to get it to this point. Over 50 people were involved in the renovations.\u201d\n\nA meat locker/cooler area has been transformed into a children\u2019s playroom. A main office was turned into a nursery. An outdoor smoking area was turned into a toddlers\u2019 play area. Shelves were removed, walls were painted and tables and chairs were added to create the warm interior.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of cleaning up, hiding wires, moving cabinets,\u201d Chris Uttecht said.\n\nLast year, Lodge owner Tim Swoboda announced he had sold the building to Menards.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be leveling the building, and making it part of the depot,\u201d Swoboda said at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet; we put a lot of work into it, so it\u2019s hard to see it demolished.\u201d\n\nSwoboda said Menards approached him with the offer.\n\nCN railroad opened an intermodal rail terminal \u2014 essentially an outdoor distribution center \u2014 in February 2012, on nearby property alongside River Country Co-op\u2019s site. CN ships its products from across the world into the rail yard, where the containers are unloaded and shipped around the Midwest, with Menards as CN\u2019s largest client.\n\nIn September 2013, River Country Co-op installed a rail container loading facility at its headquarters, allowing the company to unload semitrucks filled with grain and into rail containers that are shipped to Asia. It appeared that the building was going to be torn down to allow for expansion of the rail yard.\n\nSwoboda purchased the building and opened The Lodge in 2009. In 2012, Swoboda put a 4,000-square-foot addition on the building at a cost of $1 million, city records show. He estimates the total building is 9,000 square feet, on a lot of about 1.25 acres.\n\nIt is unclear why Menards opted to turn around and make the building available for lease. Menards officials couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nThe liquor license that Swoboda held was returned to the city, where it was claimed by another business, so it would have been a long shot for another tavern to open in the space.\n\nThe Uttechts also don\u2019t know why the building is still standing but they are happy it was available. They signed a long-term lease, knowing at the end of that period they could wind up having to move if Menards decides to raze the site.\n\n\u201cMenards was great to work with on this,\u201d Jaci Uttecht said. \u201cFor us, the church isn\u2019t about the building. We\u2019ll probably be in a different space down the road.\u201d\n\nRiver City Community Church has a service at 10:30 a.m. on Sundays, followed by a potluck brunch at 11:45 a.m. Students in grades 6-12 are welcome to return at 6:30 p.m. that evening for a youth gathering. Volleyball courts in the rear of the building have been cleaned up and will be used frequently, the Uttechts said.\n\nThe church members purchased the furnishings through various websites or obtained them through donations.\n\nWhile the church is new, the Uttechts said they are averaging 80 people on Sundays, as congregation members are inviting other family, friends and neighbors to visit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of word-of-mouth,\u201d Jaci Uttecht said. \u201cThey are finding community here.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Leader-Telegram, http://www.leadertelegram.com/", "Channel One Food Bank volunteer Ann Farrell reaches for apples at a Northeast Rochester, Minn., home where a team of volunteers gleaned apples from about 30 trees Monday, October 29, 2018. (Ken Klotzbach/The Rochester Post-Bulletin via AP)\n\nROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) \u2014 A gentle thud can be heard every time an apple from one of Kelsey Johnson\u2019s 30 backyard trees falls and hits the ground.\n\nBut the northwest Rochester homeowner said she can\u2019t possibly use all of the thousands of Honeycrisps and Connell Reds.\n\n\u201cI would hate for any of this to go to waste,\u201d Johnson told the Post-Bulletin . \u201cSure, the deer eat them, but they don\u2019t need 4,000 apples.\u201d\n\nSo, when a friend suggested she give Channel One Food Bank a call, she thought that was a perfect fit.\n\n\u201cBefore I had my two young ones, I was a single mom and I was on assistance and went to food banks,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that was a decade ago, and they didn\u2019t have fresh fruit. So, when I heard they took fresh fruit, I thought, \u2018How awesome that they give access to that too \u2014 something that\u2019s healthy.\u2019\u201d\n\nJohnson had started to pick and bring them in herself, estimating that she bagged 2,000 apples a few weeks ago, but there was no way she could do it all herself.\n\nThat\u2019s where the \u201cglean team\u201d comes in.\n\nGleaners are Channel One volunteers who go and collect produce from around the area that potentially could become waste.\n\nOrganized by the food bank\u2019s food sourcing manager, Adam Peterson, gleaning is a unique way to continue to add to what the local nonprofit food bank can offer the community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our mission to help feed people in need,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cWe want to find unique ways to find food and get produce in. We have to be creative to find every avenue we can.\u201d\n\nWhile gleaning on a home property is slightly unusual, he said they often work with local orchards, picking and taking the apples that won\u2019t sell.\n\nOctober is the biggest gleaning month for the food bank. While they\u2019ve collected produce ranging from squash to grapes in the past, Peterson said apples have been their biggest food this year.\n\nRipe after the growing season, the apples can be gleaned easily by using ladders to hand-pick them into bags and buckets, or with the help of special poles with tines that detach the fruit\u2019s stem from the tree.\n\nOnce collected, Peterson said Channel One has a clean room where they can go through and even bag the produce. But a large tote \u2014 such as the one filled with 800 pounds of apples from Johnson\u2019s home \u2014 simply could be open for food bank customers to pick through.\n\nBut before those apples can be picked, it\u2019s volunteer gleaners such as Ann Farrell who get them from the trees to the food bank.\n\nThe now-retired Spanish interpreter and librarian for Mayo Clinic said it is a great opportunity and cause to help.\n\n\u201cIf this homeowner is offering up apples, and we can use those to help those who need Channel One, why wouldn\u2019t (we)?\u201d Farrell said. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard, it\u2019s just a little awkward trying not to poke yourself in the eye or fall off the ladder and pick a good apple.\u201d\n\nBut in order to get those good apples to the Channel One food bank at all, it takes the nonprofit\u2019s coordination of donations from apple tree owners and volunteers to make gleaning a success for all involved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that Rochester has Channel One,\u201d Ferrell said, \u201cand that we do as much as we can to help the community.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Post-Bulletin, http://www.postbulletin.com", "DULUTH, Minn. (AP) \u2014 All that glitters wasn\u2019t gold recently when Nordic skiers young and old gathered in Duluth to hear from an Olympic champion.\n\nIt was red, and silver, and purple, too \u2014 sparkling glitter on the faces of the athletes who came to see their home-state hero, Jessie Diggins.\n\nDiggins helped win America\u2019s first Olympic gold medal in Nordic skiing earlier this year in South Korea, when she sprinted to gold in the team relay. But to many of the skiers on hand at a ski chalet at the base of Spirit Mountain on Sunday, the glitter \u2014 and the example Diggins has set, win or lose \u2014 were equally meaningful.\n\nWearing glitter under the eyes is a trend Diggins helped popularize among skiers. But for years Minnesota state high school rules didn\u2019t allow skiers to wear it in races. So last year dozens of students signed a petition, and Diggins was one of several U.S. ski team members who also signed it. And the officials in charge relented.\n\nAs hundreds of people filed in to see Diggins at the fundraiser for a new ski trail, members of the Ely High School ski team greeted them with glitter for whoever wanted it. Among them was junior Kalyssa Eilrich.\n\n\u201cHer fighting for us to wear the glitter has inspired me to keep the glitter going \u2014 and also, when she won the medal, that inspired me to push myself harder,\u201d Eilrich told Minnesota Public Radio . \u201cOn the days I didn\u2019t want to go out and practice, I would go out in the rain and cold.\u201d\n\nThe young skiers on hand snapped selfies with Diggins, and even took part in a short workout. Among the crowd was 12-year-old Lucia Hagenmiller of Duluth.\n\n\u201cHer spirit really inspires me, because she\u2019s always really positive, (and) she\u2019s really focused too,\u201d Hagenmiller said. \u201cAnd I like how she has fun, too.\u201d\n\nSylvie Galloway, 10, came with her family all the way from Virginia, on the Iron Range. The whole Galloway family sported glitter \u2014 her older sister, even her parents, including her mom August.\n\n\u201cJessie Diggins is such a positive and strong young woman, and she\u2019s so team-oriented,\u201d August Galloway said. \u201cSo even though it\u2019s an individual sport, that message of being part of a team and giving that 100 percent as a team \u2014 that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to see my girls do, too.\u201d\n\nWhen Diggins isn\u2019t training, she\u2019s made it her mission to help grow excitement for the sport.\n\n\u201cI feel really lucky that I get to ... help share what I love about the sport \u2014 and if I can inspire even one kid to go out there and work hard and be a good teammate and push themselves to, you know, new boundaries and see what their body is capable of,\u201d Diggins said.\n\nParticipation in high school cross country skiing in Minnesota has grown by 38 percent in the past 10 years \u2014 46 percent among girls.\n\nBonnie Fuller-Kask has coached the Duluth East cross country ski team for the past 20 years. She has over 100 student-athletes. She said that in years past it was always split roughly 50-50 between boys and girls. But this past winter, Fuller-Kask said, girls made up two-thirds of the team.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of that is the excitement of Jessie Diggins, even before she won this Olympic gold, she won world championships before with Kikkan Randall, and has placed highly and she\u2019s been very visible in Minnesota,\u201d Fuller-Kask said.\n\nShe said it also helps that there are no benchwarmers in the sport. Any student who wants to ski, can ski.\n\n\u201cI think for kids, it\u2019s really nice for them to know going into a program, that they\u2019ve got their place on the team,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to be frightened of being told, \u2018You\u2019re cut, go home, we don\u2019t want you here.\u2019\u201d\n\nDuluth East junior Clara Kramer is part of the Nordic ski team.\n\n\u201cI like skiing because you get to do it with your friends, and it\u2019s really fun to be outside ... in the woods in the snow, and you can go really fast,\u201d she said, her face also shimmering with glitter. \u201cIt\u2019s just really fun. I love it.\u201d\n\nBut to continue to increase the sport\u2019s popularity among Minnesota youth, several high school coaches say more ski trails with artificial snow will be needed, as natural snow has become more and more inconsistent as Minnesota\u2019s winters have warmed in recent decades.\n\n\u201cMan-made snow is going to make a difference in participation numbers,\u201d said Robb Lageson, head coach at St. Paul Central High School and president of the Minnesota state high school Nordic ski coaches association.\n\nIn Duluth, Diggins helped raise money for a new $2 million ski trail that will be the region\u2019s first with artificial snow, as well as lights and daily grooming. The city covered $1.25 million of the cost with proceeds from a sales tax on lodging, food and beverages. The Duluth Cross Country Ski Club is raising the rest.\n\nDiggins is also active with a group called Protect our Winters, which is working with the outdoor sports industry to fight climate change.\n\n\u201cWe see firsthand the effects of places that have always had natural snow, and suddenly we\u2019re racing on a ribbon of manmade snow with green grass in December,\u201d Diggins said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Minnesota Public Radio News, http://www.mprnews.org", "AMBER, Iowa (AP) \u2014 No one can be sure of how the first hula hoop came to be perched around a branch of the large, dead oak tree in the tiny town of Amber, Iowa.\n\nA storm, most people say, serendipitously blew that first hula hoop high up onto the tree.\n\nOthers say a man who lives in the area threw the hoop up there to celebrate his 40th birthday. Another man claims that first hula hoop belonged to his wife and he tossed it on the tree because he was mad they were getting a divorce.\n\n\u201cThere a few different stories out there and you don\u2019t know who to believe,\u201d Bobby Krum, who lives in Amber and is president of the town\u2019s community club, told the Quad-City Time . \u201cSo, we really can\u2019t say how it happened.\u201d\n\nHowever it started, that\u2019s not where the mystery ends surrounding the Hula Hoop Tree.\n\nFor a while, at least a few months, the lone hula hoop stayed where it had landed. People driving by noticed it, sometimes swaying in the wind but always clinging onto the tree.\n\n\u201cWe would see it up there,\u201d Krum said. \u201cAnd think, \u2018Well, that\u2019s kind of funny.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt some point in 2015, according to Krum and others familiar with the tree, more hoops were thrown up onto the tree. One day, there were 10. Then, 20.\n\n\u201cNext thing you know,\u201d Krum said. \u201cIt\u2019s what you see today.\u201d\n\nRegina Engelbart, who lives in Amber, watched the tree\u2019s transformation from her kitchen window.\n\n\u201cNobody saw anyone add any hoops,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like a big secret. They just appeared, kind of magically.\u201d\n\nToday, the tree is something to behold.\n\nIt\u2019s something that pops up seemingly out of nowhere on the quiet E23 County Home Road in rural Jones County. It\u2019s something that causes passers-by \u2014 truck drivers and commuters and families in the middle of a cross-country road trip and teenagers on their way to prom \u2014 to pull over and get a look.\n\nAbout 200 colorful hula hoops regularly adorn the tree, which has become a landmark, of the quirky variety, in eastern Iowa. Visitors from around the Midwest and beyond have shared selfies with \u201cHer Majesty,\u201d as it is referred to on the Amber Iowa Hula Hoop Tree Facebook page.\n\nAlong with faraway fans, there is a small, dedicated network of people who tend to the tree. They buy new hula hoops and return hoops that have fallen off back to their spots. Some also paint rocks \u2014 hundreds have been painted in the last two years \u2014 to be placed at the base of the tree for visitors to take as souvenirs.\n\nIn that group is Chris Nadge, who works at the nearby car retailer Yogi\u2019s Inc. in Monticello.\n\n\u201cWhen you see it, there\u2019s like an initial shock,\u201d Nadge said. \u201cA hula hoop is meant to be twirling around a person, not high up on a tree. They just seem out of place on a tree.\u201d\n\nNadge started the Hula Hoop Tree\u2019s Facebook page, which has over 1,000 followers, because he wanted more people to experience the \u201cwonderful surprise.\u201d He also thought the tree could, on social media, do what it does best: Make people smile.\n\n\u201cI deleted my personal Facebook, because all you see on there is people talking about politics, bad news and people fighting with each other,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then maybe you come across a photo of a hula hoop tree on your feed. And it\u2019s just like you\u2019re driving down the road and coming across the tree by accident. And you get that same feel-good feeling.\u201d\n\nGeorgia Sack, who lives in Lost Nation and also works at Yogi\u2019s Inc., drives by the tree every day, twice per day, on her way to work.\n\n\u201cEvery time we see it, it makes us happy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a piece of art.\u201d\n\nSack has thrown plenty of hula hoops up there herself, which is \u201cnot easy, by the way.\u201d Some people, she said, write a name of a loved one or a motivational phrase on a hoop before tossing it up.\n\n\u201cA lot of people make wishes when they throw their hoop,\u201d she said. \u201cFor some people, it\u2019s kind of like a wishing well. It means something different to everyone.\u201d\n\nTo her?\n\n\u201cThe world has so much negativity and this is just something fun and positive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt reminds you that life still has some whimsy in it.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much to the town of Amber.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re driving through and you blink, you\u2019d miss it,\u201d Krum said.\n\nEngelbart sizes up the town\u2019s population this way: \u201cIf you count up all the people and all the cats and dogs, there\u2019s maybe 100 of us who live here.\u201d\n\nAmber used to a railroad town with a few bars, a gas station and a grocery store in town. All of that is gone now.\n\nBut Amber has something. It has the Hula Hoop Tree. And the community, Krum promises, is going to make sure \u201cHer Majesty\u201d lives on.\n\nOne morning about a year ago, someone set fire to the Hula Hoop Tree.\n\n\u201cThe fire department came over,\u201d Krum said. \u201cNormally, with that kind of fire, they would just knock the tree over and destroy it. But they knew it was important to everybody.

It was at the encouragement of her knitting group at the At Home Store in Fairfield, where she sells her yarn, that she decided on sheep.\n\n\u201cI knew from the people who have knit there for like 20-plus years that they\u2019re always on the lookout for exotic different fiber, and now the push is to slow fashion and knowing where everything comes from,\u201d Rhonda Foster said, gazing over her flock of 22 sheep as they munched on pumpkins, their favorite treat.\n\nShe knows them all by marking, name and personality.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re calming,\u201d she told The Hawk Eye , adding that friends of hers have asked to visit the flock after a hard day. \u201cThey get their emotional cues from people\u2019s faces. ... They kind of are a barometer for people\u2019s feelings.\u201d\n\nThough she knows much about sheep now, Foster\u2019s background was in nursing, not shepherding. So, to prepare for the venture, she took lamb and wool management courses online through Minnesota West Community and Technical College\u2019s Pipestone campus to learn the trade and sought out livestock veterinarian lectures to attend.\n\nWith the knowledge that diet affects the quality of the wool, Foster looked around for a local, high-quality hay provider, which she found in JD Stucker of rural Danville. The alfalfa and timothy hay blend provides a high level of protein for the sheep.\n\n\u201cIf you have a low-protein diet, you\u2019re going to have a lesser-quality wool,\u201d she said. \u201cThe wool tells the story of the animal\u2019s health. It represents a whole year of work.\u201d\n\nThe Fosters also have partnered with the Department of Natural Resources for pasture and woodland conservation efforts. Invasive honey suckle that grows in the woods around their home also is high in protein, so they cut it down and feed it to the flock to help eradicate it from the woods.\n\nIn deciding what kind of sheep she wanted, Foster, a retired nurse and longtime knitter, attended fiber and wool fairs, such as Iowa Sheep and Wool in June and Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival in fall, in search of the perfect texture.\n\n\u201cI wanted something that was next-to-skin that wouldn\u2019t scratch,\u201d she said.\n\nShe wanted a small, hardy, exotic breed in need of conservation efforts. She found all those things in Shetlands.\n\nHaving found a Shetland breeder in Waverly, she and her husband brought home 10 3-month-old lambs descended from a 4,500-year-old breed indigenous to the Shetland Islands. Foster gave them Scottish names, such as Finsla and Faegan James.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know much about how to manage them, so I kind of trained them like I do my dogs,\u201d Foster said.\n\nShe used a bell and treats to train the sheep to come in the barn at night. They are given free rein of the fenced-in pasture and barn, which is left open throughout the day but closed at night to protect them from coyotes.\n\nWord of her flock spread, and it wasn\u2019t long before she was contacted by a woman in northern Illinois who needed to downsize her Shetland flock. Foster agreed, and she took in four more sheep.\n\nAfter the first sheering, done by Justin Shau, Foster shopped around for someone who could spin the wool into yarn, sending wool to several Iowa spinners so she could get samples of each. She settled on Round Barn Fiber in Rockford. Rather than dye the yarn, it is left the color of the sheep from which the wool came, resulting in a range of white, brown and black hues.\n\n\u201cIt comes back and it smells like the sheep and it still has little pieces of hay, which reminds you that it\u2019s a farm product,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s also an Iowa product, with everything from the hay the sheep eat to the logo design, done by Jennifer Bell of Fairfield, coming from Iowa residents.\n\nThe first batch of home-grown yarn sold out within a day during a Meet the Sheep event at the At Home Store, during which Foster and three of her sheep visited the store to greet customers and show them where the product came from. Each skein of yarn is tagged with the name of the sheep from which the wool used to make it was shorn.\n\n\u201cI picked the colors (of sheep) that I thought the knitters would like,\u201d Foster said.\n\nShe will have more yarn to sell this year as her flock has grown by eight sheep.\n\nLast year, at the advisement of a woman Foster met at the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival, Foster decided to expand her flock to include Gotland and Finnish sheep.\n\n\u201cShe said if you love the Shetlands, you\u2019ll really love the other guys because they\u2019re mellow,\u201d Foster said.\n\nNot only are their temperaments desirable, but the Sweden and Finnish breeds can be sheered twice a year, once in early spring and again in fall.\n\nShe and her husband set out to get four sheep, but, at the suggestion of her husband, they brought home eight, raising their sheep count to 22 and resulting in a wider range of colors and textures.\n\nThose textures and colors help knitters like Foster decide what it will become.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Hawk Eye, http://www.thehawkeye.com", "In this Oct. 4, 2018 photo, Brent Bilodeau poses in Janesville, Wis.

(Anthony Wahl/The Janesville Gazette via AP)\n\nWHITEWATER, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Brent Bilodeau recalls a time in the 1980s when he felt isolated, alone and scared as a gay college student.\n\nHe never wants any student to experience what he did.\n\n\u201cIt takes a horrible, horrible toll,\u201d Bilodeau told The Janesville Gazette .\n\nToday, the 56-year-old is a driving force on the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater campus to make all students feel welcome, safe and included.\n\nThis month, he received the Dr. P.B. Poorman Award for work to improve the lives of LGBTQ students. LGBTQ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer or questioning.\n\nBilodeau is interim vice chancellor for student affairs and an enthusiastic member of the Chancellor\u2019s Committee for LGBT Issues. His passion lies in being part of a campus rich in diversity.\n\n\u201cIt is education\u2019s responsibility to unlock unlimited possibilities for students, all students,\u201d he said.\n\nThose who know Bilodeau say his infectious energy inspires colleagues.\n\n\u201cDr. Bilodeau brings such an irrefutable amount of joy to this work of LGBTQ inclusion and access,\u201d said Stephanie Selvick, the LGBTQ campus coordinator who nominated Bilodeau for the award.\n\nBilodeau has advocated for gender-inclusive policies, especially for transgender students.\n\nOne of those policies allows the student to be called by his or her preferred name.\n\n\u201cTransgender students may wish to be referred to by names that are different than the names they were given at birth,\u201d he explained.\n\nOften, birth names reflect gender. But transgender students might feel an internal sense of gender that is different from names assigned to them.\n\n\u201cA student\u2019s birth name may be Margaret,\u201d Bilodeau said. \u201cBut today the student may prefer to be called John, Mark or Oliver. When in that situation, we have worked to implement a policy that allows students to be referred to on campus by their preferred name.\u201d\n\nThe change is important because a name is a reflection of identity.\n\n\u201cIt is critical for students to feel supported and accepted for who they are,\u201d Bilodeau said.\n\nHe also has been an advocate for increased access to single-stall bathrooms labeled all-gender.\n\nHis effort is in partnership with students, student organizations \u201cand many offices on campus committed to many forms of diversity,\u201d Bilodeau said. \u201cSo much of my work happens in partnership and in collaboration with others.\u201d\n\nBilodeau\u2019s commitment to equality comes at a time when hate crimes against LGBTQ people in the U.S. are rising.\n\nLast year was the deadliest in recent history, according to the \u201cCrisis of Hate\u201d report released by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs. The report said at least 52 people were killed because of hate against LGBTQ people.\n\nOf the total, at least 29 were transgender people. The number is the most recorded since the Human Rights Campaign began keeping death totals in 2013.\n\nBilodeau\u2019s commitment to LGBTQ students stretches back almost 25 years.\n\nBefore coming to UW-Whitewater, he was the first LGBT coordinator at Michigan State University in 1994.\n\n\u201cI began to encounter transgender students for the first time,\u201d he said. \u201cI discovered there was no literature that talked about their development.\u201d\n\nHe decided to focus his research on transgender development, LGBT student identity and college climate for transgender students.\n\n\u201cEducation about transgender youth is new and so crucially important,\u201d Bilodeau said.\n\nTom Rios worked with Bilodeau for 11 years and was his supervisor at UW-Whitewater until September 2017.\n\nLGBTQ students \u201crequire us to think more fully about policies and services that are needed to help them have a sense of belonging to the university and to achieve their goals,\u201d Rios said.\n\nHe added: \u201cNo one likes to be invisible. One\u2019s identity is core to who they are.\u201d\n\nBilodeau looks to students daily to find hope and what he calls \u201ctheir purity of motive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are about doing what is right,\u201d Bilodeau said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about doing what is best for their careers.

(AP) \u2014 Taking a break after a morning spent serving coffee and breakfast, Erin Schroeder laughs, repeating the joke that she and her husband, Ben, have a new child that now occupies much of her time.\n\nLike any young one, it\u2019s consuming a lot of their energy, but it\u2019s also helped bring a buzz to Hartington\u2019s business district.\n\nThe two veterinarians have found a niche restoring century-old buildings here, and their latest project, the historic Hartington Hotel, has kept Erin busy. Rather than doctoring area residents\u2019 pets and horses, Erin Schroeder has been welcoming them to the coffee shop, ballroom and guest suites she and Ben opened inside the hotel on Oct. 1.\n\n\u201cThis is our third child,\u201d Erin said with a chuckle. \u201cThe joke is I\u2019m on maternity leave to take care of our new building.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve been taking care of one thing or another \u2014 usually many at the same time \u2014 their entire professional careers, especially since the restoration bug bit them after moving to Hartington a little over a decade ago to take over Cedar County Veterinary Services from Ben\u2019s father, John.\n\nNeither Erin nor Ben Schroeder had a construction background. They loved animals instead. Erin grew up near Lake Champlain in Westport, New York, knowing from a young age that she wanted to be a veterinarian. After graduating from Syracuse University, where she was a scholarship basketball player, she went to vet school at Kansas State University, where she met and married Ben Schroeder.\n\nBy 2007, they had bought Ben\u2019s father\u2019s practice. They\u2019ve moved the clinic three times, remodeling each new location to fit their needs for treating cattle, horses and small animals. They did the same when they opened a clinic in Vermillion, South Dakota, and again after opening a Yankton, South Dakota, clinic, which they\u2019ve since sold.\n\nThey grew to like the demolition, planning and design that goes into renovation projects, a departure from their daily veterinary work, the Sioux City Journal reported.\n\n\u201cI really feel like it\u2019s two different sides of my brain and my husband, too. It gives us each a creative outlet,\u201d Erin Schroeder said.\n\nThe buildings got bigger, the projects more ambitious.\n\nIn 2015, they bought the Globe clothing store building, which was built in 1901. They gutted it and turned the top floor into a home for them and their two boys. The main floor was turned into an event space for small parties and gatherings. After finishing that project, they asked a real estate agent if he had any buildings they could buy and restore. He eventually asked if they\u2019d be interested in the Hartington Hotel, a building just up the street from the Globe that they\u2019d eyed a time or two.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we got out of the office before saying yes,\u201d Erin Schroeder said.\n\nVacant for 23 years, the former hotel, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, still stood prominently on North Broadway, Hartington\u2019s main business district. The three-story brick structure, built in 1917, was structurally sound and had been gutted years earlier but had reached a point at which something needed to be done before it began to deteriorate.\n\nThey didn\u2019t have immediate plans for the building, but they knew one thing for sure.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to preserve the historic character\u201d and turn it into an attraction, something to bring people to Hartington, Erin said.\n\nThey set to work as they made plans. Ben Schroeder did a lot of the demolition work, Erin planned and designed the final product. Both worked to clean and restore original wooden beams, hardwood and tile floors and the hotel counter. A contractor did the major construction work.\n\nThey began work late last year and have transformed an empty building into an attractive and active business.\n\nThe main floor is home to The Lobby, a coffee shop that serves gourmet coffee, breakfast and lunch. Erin Schroeder said local residents desired a formal dining option in town, so on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, they host a sit-down buffet in the ballroom, which also can be reserved for private parties. It\u2019s also been used for weddings and receptions.\n\nThe top two floors were renovated into 17 bedrooms and nine bathrooms divided among four suites. They\u2019re popular with wedding parties, guests and families.\n\nIn the basement is The Tap Room, an event bar that was a speakeasy during Prohibition.\n\nErin Schroeder will soon open a home decor shop named Togged to the Bricks in a storefront inside the hotel.\n\nIt\u2019s been a lot of work, a lot of time balancing treating animals and giving a historic building special treatment, but it\u2019s been worth it, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something you have to be passionate about,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just makes us proud.\u201d\n\nThat pride appears to be contagious. Erin Schroeder said that since they\u2019ve restored the Globe and now the hotel, she and Ben have noticed other downtown business owners improving their buildings, whether it\u2019s a new awning, touching up the facade or doing some renovations. There\u2019s more traffic downtown on Saturday nights.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a renewed energy,\u201d Erin said.\n\nThe Schroeders plan to keep that energy flowing. Erin has her eyes on other older buildings she\u2019d love to restore. It may seem like an interest that has little in common with veterinary medicine, but Erin said the two are more similar than you\u2019d think.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot like an animal,\u201d Erin Schroeder said. \u201cWe see things that are broken, sick and debilitated. Most of the time with TLC and the right care you can improve an animal\u2019s life, and it\u2019s the same thing with buildings. You just have to love them.\u201d\n\nThe Schroeders obviously have a lot of love to give. More buildings are destined to become part of their family and Hartington\u2019s future.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Sioux City Journal, http://www.siouxcityjournal.com", "DAVIS, Calif.

(AP) \u2014 When Jay Marchman was a student at the University of Alabama, the Dothan native would bring bags of boiled peanuts from McNeill Farms back to Tuscaloosa with him. He had grown up eating the delicacies and assumed his friends liked them, too.\n\n\u201cIt was like pulling teeth to get people to eat them,\u201d he says.\n\nLittle did he know, as a business major, that one day he would return to his hometown \u2014 known as the peanut capital of the world \u2014 and take over for Ed and Nita McNeill, who had founded McNeill Farms 25 years earlier.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been eating these peanuts from these folks since I was a kid,\u201d he says. And now he\u2019s teaching his daughters, Frances, 4, and Maryn, 3, how to eat them.\n\n\u201cAs fast as I can shell them, they\u2019ll eat \u2019em,\u201d he says.\n\nBoiled peanuts, which are actually not considered a nut at all but a pea variety, are even popular with the hipster crowd. Paramount, a popular eatery at the corner of 20th Street and 2nd Avenue North in Birmingham, offers an Alabama Hummus appetizer that substitutes boiled peanuts for chickpeas, served with pita bread.\n\nThey\u2019re often found at less trendy locations like roadside stands and gas stations, as well, and they\u2019re a tailgating must-have for many football fans. Best served hot, the shells soften as they\u2019re boiled, and the peanuts inside are soft and mushy. The best way to eat them is to bite into the shell, releasing the brine and the pea inside; then throw the shell away.\n\nThe taste of fresh boiled peanuts can\u2019t compare to that of those warming in a ubiquitous crock pot in a convenience store or, God forbid, sold in a can. When boiled peanuts are made with green peanuts that have recently been extracted from the earth, they become \u201ca whole other animal,\u201d Jay says.\n\nMcNeill Farms\u2019 peanuts are grown on a total of 3,000 acres, mostly in central Florida, where they benefit from an extended growing season. \u201cWe get green peanuts before anyone else,\u201d he says, so McNeill has the first and last peanuts every year, all hand-picked in the fields, then de-stemmed, washed and packed. Each Wednesday from the first of April through Thanksgiving, a refrigerated semi-truck transports bushels of green peanuts to Dothan.\n\nAt McNeill Farms\u2019 produce stand in Midland City, fresh boiled peanuts and green peanuts for do-it-yourselfers are available six days per week. \u201cWe have 12 50-gallon pots we boil them in daily,\u201d he says. Baseball parks and football stadiums sell them like crazy during their games. And, on the wholesale side of the business, Jay sells to independent grocers and produce stands.\n\nMcNeill Farms is the biggest supplier of boiled peanuts in the Dothan area, Jay says, selling 4,000 pounds per week this time of year and between 7,000 and 10,000 pounds per week in the springtime. Though he has expanded to offer other produce such as zipper peas, butter beans, Slocomb tomatoes and homemade creamed corn, he says peanuts are the staple, making up a solid 75 percent of his business.\n\nAnd just in case you don\u2019t live within driving distance of Dothan but would like to try boiled peanuts from McNeill Farms, they\u2019re delivered as far north as Montgomery every Wednesday and shipped all over the country anytime. Jay says he has a large following on the West Coast, where he mails boxes of boiled peanuts packed in dry ice. Boiled peanuts freeze beautifully, he says, and can be thawed and re-heated for that just-scooped flavor.\n\nMost of the time, Jay\u2019s peanuts are simply boiled in those large vats of salty water, but on weekends and at special events \u2014 like the upcoming 75th annual National Peanut Festival, held in Dothan Nov. 2-11 \u2014 he might do batches flavored with Cajun spice or dill pickle flavoring.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s technique involved, but no secret ingredient,\u201d he says.

(AP) \u2014 Authorities trying to make sense of why a gunman killed 12 people at a Southern California bar are not publicly discussing what they\u2019ve learned, but at least one Instagram post he made after beginning the massacre has emerged as an early focus.\n\nSocial media platforms have scrubbed that and any other posts following Wednesday night\u2019s massacre. But one law enforcement official said Ian David Long, a 28-year-old former Marine, posted about his mental state and whether people would believe he was sane.\n\nAuthorities also were investigating whether he believed his former girlfriend would be at the Borderline Bar and Grill, said the official, who was briefed on the investigation but not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nA second law enforcement official, Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Capt. Garo Kuredjian, said that \u2014 based on time stamps \u2014 the gunman apparently stopped shooting inside the bar and posted to Instagram. Kuredjian said he didn\u2019t know the content of any posts. Instagram and Facebook typically refuse to discuss individual accounts and did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nVideo and sound captured gun shots as terrified patrons tried to escape a Southern California bar Wednesday. A Marine combat veteran killed 12 people at the Borderline Bar and Grill. (Nov 8)\n\nAuthorities described an attack of military efficiency. None of those injured was hurt by gunfire. When the gunman shot his .45-caliber pistol, he killed. As scores of police officers closed in, Long apparently shot and killed himself.\n\nSeveral people who knew Long in the suburb of Thousand Oaks where the gunman went to high school and eventually moved back in with his mother described him in disturbing terms.\n\nLong made others feel uncomfortable going back to his teens.\n\nDominique Colell, who coached girls\u2019 track and field at the high school where Long was a sprinter, remembers an angry young man who could be verbally and physically combative.\n\nIn one instance, Colell said Long used his fingers to mimic shooting her in the back of the head as she talked to another athlete. In another, he grabbed her rear and midsection after she refused to return a cellphone he said was his.\n\n\u201cI literally feared for myself around him,\u201d Colell said in an interview Friday. \u201cHe was the only athlete that I was scared of.\u201d\n\nColell said she wanted to kick Long off the team, but the boy\u2019s coach urged her to reconsider because that could compromise his goal of joining the Marines. She relented when, at the next track meet, Long apologized in front of several coaches and administrators.\n\nAttempts to get comment by phone and in person from officials at Newbury Park High School and its school district were unsuccessful. Both were closed because of a destructive wildfire in the area.\n\nAs investigators worked to figure out what set him off, President Donald Trump blamed mental illness, describing the gunman as \u201ca very sick puppy\u201d who had \u201ca lot of problems.\u201d At the White House on Friday, Trump touted his efforts to fund work on post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans and ignored questions about stricter gun control laws.\n\nInvestigators have not commented on whether mental illness played a role in the rampage. But a mental health specialist who assessed Long after sheriff\u2019s deputies responded to a call about his agitated behavior last spring worried he might be suffering from PTSD.\n\nThe incident happened in April, when yelling and loud banging noises coming from the home Long shared with his mother prompted a next-door neighbor to call authorities. The mental health specialist concluded there were no grounds to have him involuntarily committed.\n\nAmong the dead in the shooting rampage were a sheriff\u2019s sergeant gunned down as he entered the bar and a U.S. Navy veteran who survived last year\u2019s massacre in which a gunman in a high-rise Las Vegas hotel killed 58 people at an outdoor country music festival.\n\n___\n\nBalsamo reported from Washington.

It was one of those games where we found a lot of space.\u201d\n\nMinnesota, which defeated Los Angeles 4-1 on Thursday, had a 43-21 advantage in shots as it dominated throughout. Coach Bruce Boudreau said Friday\u2019s game ranks up there with his club\u2019s best game this season.\n\n\u201cI was a little worried about the first period because I thought they would come out knowing we played last night really hard and it was the opposite. We took it right to them and took their spirit away,\u201d Boudreau said.\n\nJason Zucker, Jonas Brodin and Jordan Greenway also scored for the Wild. Alex Stalock stopped 20 shots for his third win of the season.\n\nPontus Aberg had the Ducks\u2019 goal, and John Gibson made 38 saves. Coach Randy Carlyle said his team was flat, but his players were more direct.\n\n\u201cIt was just embarrassing. There\u2019s really nothing to break down,\u201d left wing Andrew Cogliano said.\n\nCaptain Ryan Getzlaf said the Ducks lacked mental focus and added \u201cwe were losing pucks everywhere.

Granlund didn\u2019t face any pressure behind the net three minutes into the period when he passed it to Zucker, who fired it under Gibson\u2019s pads for his second. Granlund then scored his team-leading eighth when he was able to get it under Gibson\u2019s glove on a pass from Zucker.\n\nAberg put Anaheim on the board with his fifth in his last seven games. The Ducks were on the power play when Hampus Lindholm found Aberg in the right faceoff circle as the left wing then fired it past Stalock. It was Anaheim\u2019s first goal with the man advantage in its last 16 chances.\n\nBrodin put the Wild back up by three goals midway through the third when he fired one into the top corner of the net for his third. Ganlund completed the scoring when he was able to take advantage of a rebound off Gibson.\n\nNOTES: It is the first time Minnesota has won both games of a back-to-back set this season. ...

(AP) \u2014 Two people were found dead as a pair of wildfires stretched from inland canyons to the Pacific in Southern California on Saturday, leaving people sifting through the remains of both mansions and modest homes for anything they had left.\n\nThe two bodies were found severely burned inside a car on a long residential driveway in Malibu, Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s Chief John Benedict said. The home is on a winding stretch of Mulholland Highway with steep panoramic views, where on Saturday the roadway was littered with rocks, a few large boulders and fallen power lines, some of them still on fire. Most of the surrounding structures were leveled.\n\nThe deaths brings to 25 the number of people killed in the state\u2019s wildfires in the past few days, with 23 found dead in a Northern California wildfire.\n\nFirefighters have saved thousands of homes despite working in \u201cextreme, tough fire conditions that they said they have never seen in their life,\u201d Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said.\n\nThose vicious conditions on Friday night gave way to calm Saturday, with winds reduced to breezes. No new growth was reported on the larger of the two fires, which stands at 109 square miles (282 square kilometers), and firefighters now have the blaze 5 percent contained.\n\nA raging Southern California wildfire has triggered a mandatory evacuation order for the entire beachside city of Malibu. The fire broke out Thursday northwest of Los Angeles and roared southward, jumping the U.S. 101 freeway. (Nov. 9)\n\nProgress also came against the smaller fire, prompting Ventura County officials to allow people in a handful of communities to return to their homes.\n\nHundreds of thousands across the region remain under evacuation orders, and could stay that way for days as winds pick up again.\n\nOsby said losses to homes were significant but did not say how many had burned. Officials said earlier that 150 houses had been destroyed and the number would rise.\n\nFire burned in famously ritzy coastal spots like Malibu , where Lady Gaga, Kim Kardashian West, Guillermo del Toro and Martin Sheen were among those forced out of their homes amid a citywide evacuation order.\n\n\u201cIt was way too big a firestorm,\u201d said Lani Netter, whose Malibu home was spared while her neighbor\u2019s burned. \u201cWe had tremendous, demonic winds is the only way I can put it.\u201d\n\nThe flames also burned inland through hills and canyons dotted with modest homes, reached into the corner of the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles, and stretched into suburbs like Thousand Oaks, a city of 130,000 people that just a few days ago saw 12 people killed in a mass shooting at a country music bar.\n\nWildfire raged on both sides of the city still in mourning, where about three-quarters of the population are under evacuation orders that officials urged them to heed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of tragedy in our community,\u201d said Ventura County Supervisor Linda Parks, whose district includes Thousand Oaks. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any more.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation to deny asylum to migrants who enter the country illegally, tightening the border as caravans of Central Americans slowly approach the United States. The plan was immediately challenged in court.\n\nTrump invoked the same powers he used last year to impose a travel ban that was upheld by the Supreme Court. The new regulations are intended to circumvent laws stating that anyone is eligible for asylum no matter how he or she enters the country. About 70,000 people per year who enter the country illegally claim asylum, officials said.\n\n\u201cWe need people in our country, but they have to come in legally,\u201d Trump said Friday as he departed for Paris.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and other legal groups swiftly sued in federal court in Northern California to block the regulations, arguing the measures were illegal.\n\n\u201cThe president is simply trying to run roughshod over Congress\u2019s decision to provide asylum to those in danger regardless of the manner of one\u2019s entry,\u201d said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt.\n\nThe litigation also seeks to put the new rules on hold while the case progresses.\n\nThe regulations go into effect Saturday. They would be in place for at least three months but could be extended, and don\u2019t affect people already in the country. The Justice Department said in a statement the regulations were lawful.\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement was the latest push to enforce a hard-line stance on immigration through regulatory changes and presidential orders, bypassing Congress, which has not passed any immigration law reform. But those efforts have been largely thwarted by legal challenges and, in the case of family separations this year, stymied by a global outcry that prompted Trump to retreat.\n\nOfficials said the asylum law changes are meant to funnel migrants through official border crossings for speedy rulings instead of having them try to circumvent such crossings on the nearly 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) border. The U.S. Border Patrol says it apprehended more than 50,000 people crossing illegally in October, setting a new high this year, though illegal crossings are well below historical highs from previous decades.\n\nBut the busy ports of entry already have long lines and waits, forcing immigration officials to tell some migrants to turn around and come back to make their claims. Backlogs have become especially bad in recent months at crossings in California, Arizona and Texas, with some people waiting five weeks to try to claim asylum at San Diego\u2019s main crossing.\n\n\u201cThe arrival of large numbers ... will contribute to the overloading of our immigration and asylum system and to the release of thousands ... into the interior of the United States,\u201d Trump said in the proclamation, calling it a crisis.\n\nAdministration officials said those denied asylum under the proclamation may be eligible for similar forms of protection if they fear returning to their countries, though they would be subject to a tougher threshold. Those forms of protection include \u201cwithholding of removal\u201d \u2014 which is similar to asylum, but doesn\u2019t allow for green cards or bringing families \u2014 or protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture.\n\nHomeland Security officials said they were adding staffing at the border crossings to manage the expected crush, but it\u2019s not clear how migrants, specifically families, would be held as their cases are adjudicated. Family detention centers are largely at capacity. Trump has said he wanted to erect \u201ctent cities,\u201d but nothing has been funded.\n\nThe U.S. is also working with Mexico in an effort to send some migrants back across the border. Right now, laws allow only Mexican nationals to be swiftly returned and increasingly those claiming asylum are from Central America.\n\nTrump pushed immigration issues hard in the days leading up to Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, railing against the caravans that are still hundreds of miles from the border.\n\nHe has made little mention of the issue since the election, but has sent troops to the border in response.

Not much is left in Paradise after a ferocious wildfire roared through the Northern California town as residents fled and entire neighborhoods are leveled. (AP Photo/Noah Berger)\n\nPARADISE, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The few residents of the burned-out Northern California city of Paradise who were able to inspect their property on Saturday saw nothing but disappointment.\n\nNearly the entire city of 27,000 residents lay in ruins and most were still barred from returning to the still hazardous town where small fires continued to flare.\n\nButte County Sheriff Kory Honea said Saturday 14 additional bodies were found, bringing the death toll to 23. The victims have not been identified. Two people were found dead in a wildfire in Southern California, bringing the total number of fatalities for the state to 25.\n\nThe fire became California\u2019s third deadliest since record-keeping began, with the death toll surpassing that from a blaze last year that ravaged the city of Santa Rosa.\n\nAn additional search and recovery team on top of the four already on the ground was being brought in to search for remains, Honea said. An anthropology team from California State University, Chico was helping with that effort, he said. The state Department of Justice was sending a mobile DNA lab to the area to collect genetic material from the surviving relatives of the missing to speed the identification process.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office still has 110 outstanding reports of missing people, Honea said.\n\nResidents of Paradise, California, are talking about narrow escapes from their burning homes as a wildfire rapidly approached. Many got stuck in gridlocked traffic trying to escape. (Nov. 9)\n\nIn some cases, investigators have only been able to recover bones and bone fragments, he said. He encouraged family members of the missing to submit DNA samples that could be compared with remains that are recovered.\n\n\u201cThis weighs heavy on all of us,\u201d he said. \u201cMyself and especially those staff members who are out there doing what is important work but certainly difficult work.\u201d\n\nHonea added that he\u2019s hopeful that more of those missing people will be found. The department initially had more than 500 calls about citizens who were unable to reach loved ones.\n\nBut they have been able to help find many, he said.\n\nThe flames burned down more than 6,700 buildings, almost all of them homes, making it California\u2019s most destructive wildfire since record-keeping began.\n\nMore firefighters headed to the area Saturday, with wind gusts of up to 50 miles per hour expected, raising the risk of conditions similar to those when the fire started Thursday, said Alex Hoon with the National Weather Service.\n\nThe blaze grew to 164 square miles (425 square kilometers), but crews made gains and it was partially contained, officials said. It has cost $8.1 million to fight so far, said Steve Kaufmann, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nPeople sidestepped metal that melted off cars and Jet-Skis and donned masks as they surveyed ravaged neighborhoods despite an evacuation order for all of Paradise, a town of 27,000 founded in the 1800s. Some cried when they saw nothing was left.\n\nJan McGregor, 81, got back to his small two-bedroom home in Paradise with the help of his firefighter grandson. He found his home leveled \u2014 a large metal safe and some pipe work from his septic system the only recognizable traces. The safe was punctured with bullet holes from guns inside that went off in the scorching heat.\n\nHe has lived in Paradise for nearly 80 years, moving there in 1939 when he said the town had just 3,000 people and was nicknamed Poverty Ridge. The fire was not a complete surprise, he said.\n\n\u201cWe knew Paradise was a prime target for forest fire over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had \u2019em come right up to the city limits \u2014 oh yeah \u2014 but nothing like this,\u201d he said.\n\nMcGregor said he probably would not rebuild: \u201cI have nothing here to go back to.\u201d\n\nHomes and other buildings in Paradise were still burning, and fire crews were trying to extinguish those blazes, said Scott McLean, a captain with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Officials warned firefighters to wear their helmets and be careful of falling trees.\n\nThe following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: Your browser does not support the iframe HTML tag.

The dead were found mostly inside their cars or and outside vehicles and homes.\n\nFive of the dead panicked when they couldn\u2019t escape by car because their route was cut off by a wall of fire, said Gabriel Fallon, who rode out the blaze with his parents to care for the horses, cows and livestock on their 10-acre farm in Paradise.\n\nThe group turned the other way and dashed down the paved street until it turned into dirt and passed the Fallons\u2019 farm, he said. One of the drivers stopped and asked Fallon if the direction they were going would lead them to safety. Fallon said he shook his head as the fire roared closer.\n\nThe motorists parked at the end of the road. On Saturday, the charred shells of the five cars remained where they had been parked.\n\nFallon went back to his property, where he, and his parents and their animals weathered the fire with a garden hose. The fire consumed their home, but left the barn intact.\n\n\u201cI was scared as hell,\u201d said Fallon, 42. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I was going to die.\u201d\n\nHis mother, Cathy Fallon, said she tries not to think of what she lost when her house burned to the ground. Two of her dogs and nine cats died. She also lost her great-grandmother\u2019s mandolin and end table.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t think about it,\u201d she said, beginning to cry. \u201cThe thing that hurts the most is that I lost my cats.\u201d\n\nElinor \u201cJeannie\u201d Williams, 86, was not among the nine victims of the blaze but died as she waited to be airlifted from an evacuated hospital where she was being treated for a head injury.\n\nShe was dying, and the family expected to lose her in a few days, said her stepdaughter, Lisa. Still, her death has been hard on her 84-year-old father, Robert, who also may have lost his home, she said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s lost, he\u2019s confused, he\u2019s trying to hang in there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hitting him hard. Everything is gone, including his wife.\u201d\n\nTwo destructive wildfires also burned in Southern California , tearing through Malibu mansions and working-class suburban homes and killing two people.\n\nState officials put the total number of people forced from their homes by California\u2019s fires at more than 200,000. Evacuation orders included the entire city of Malibu that is home to some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars .\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an emergency declaration providing federal funding for fires on both ends of the state. He later threatened to withhold payments to California, claiming its forest management is \u201cso poor.\u201d\n\nTrump tweeted Saturday that \u201cthere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly fires in California.\u201d Trump said \u201cbillions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201d\n\nCalifornia Governor-elect Gavin Newsom responded on Twitter that this was \u201cnot a time for partisanship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a time for coordinating relief and response and lifting those in need up,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump took a more empathetic tone later in the day, tweeting sympathies for firefighters, people who have fled their homes and the families of those killed by the flames.\n\nDrought, warmer weather attributed to climate change and home construction deeper into forests have led to more destructive wildfire seasons that have been starting earlier and lasting longer.\n\nCalifornia emerged from a five-year drought last year but has had a very dry 2018. Much of the northern two-thirds of the state, including where the fire is burning, is abnormally dry, according to a U.S. government analysis.\n\nJust 100 miles (160 kilometers) north, the Carr Fire near Redding that burned this summer was the sixth-most-destructive wildfire in California history and one of the earliest. It killed eight people in July and August and burned about 1,100 homes.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that we are saturated with these kind of fires,\u201d safety officer Jack Piccinini told firefighters in Chico.\n\nHe warned of \u201cemotional fatigue\u201d among crews from the devastation, death and injuries.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure we take care of one another, we look out for our brothers and sisters out there,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Daisy Nguyen, Olga R.

Trump has slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products, in a push to narrow the U.S. trade deficit and push back against what the U.S. views as predatory Chinese tactics on the high technology industry. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on $110 million worth of U.S. goods.\n\nYun Sun, a China expert at the Stimson Center think tank, said Beijing is uncertain about what exactly Trump wants out of a trade deal, but hopes that with U.S. midterm elections out of the way, the mercurial American president may be more inclined to reach a compromise. \u201cTheir top priority is to stabilize relations,\u201d she said.\n\nOn human rights, Pompeo voiced concern over China\u2019s treatment of religious minorities, including the mass detention of minority Uighur Muslims.

Protesters nationwide have called for the protection of special counsel Mueller's investigation into potential coordination between Russia and President Donald Trump's campaign. (Genna Martin/seattlepi.com via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Matthew G. Whitaker, the nation\u2019s new acting attorney general, repeatedly chided presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in public statements during 2016 while he was speaking for a group that is barred by its tax-exempt status from supporting or opposing political candidates during a campaign.\n\nBefore coming to the Justice Department in 2017, Whitaker was president and executive of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a charitable organization that styles itself as nonpartisan government watchdog promoting ethics and transparency. The tax-exempt group \u2014 known by its initials, FACT \u2014 is supposed to serve the public interest under Section 501c3 of the U.S. tax code, without directly or even indirectly supporting or opposing specific candidates for office.\n\nYet the group has engaged in one partisan pronouncement after another, mostly directed at Democrats. During the last presidential race, Whitaker argued in July 2016 newspaper opinion pieces that Clinton should be prosecuted for her handling of her private email server \u2014 a favorite talking point of Donald Trump. The opinion pieces identified Whitaker as FACT\u2019s leader.\n\nIn September 2016, Whitaker argued that Clinton had acted shamelessly by appointing her charity\u2019s donors to boards of the State Department when she was secretary of state.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody in the history of our country that served in the administration has been this bold in their private fundraising and their sort of giving favors,\u201d he said in a radio interview posted on YouTube by his group.\n\nDaniel Borochoff, president of CharityWatch, a Chicago-based group that monitors the nonprofit world, said that statement appears to violate the IRS ban on engagement for or against a particular political candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s highly critical of a candidate, and he ought not to be doing that, because it\u2019s a political partisan comment,\u201d he said.\n\nWhitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, left FACT in October 2017 to become Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 chief of staff. He was named this week by President Trump to take over at least temporarily for Sessions, who resigned at Trump\u2019s request.\n\nFACT was founded in 2015, tax filings show. Whitaker drew a sizable portion of its budget as his salary as president and executive director \u2014 in 2016 he earned more than twice what leaders of similar groups were paid on average that year, according to data from another watchdog group, Charity Navigator.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Whitaker earned a total of $654,000 from FACT \u2014 30 percent of its entire spending of $2.2 million over that two-year span. His 2016 salary was $402,000; the average CEO or executive director at 380 advocacy or education charities in that year made a salary of $173,099, according to Matthew J. Viola, a vice president at Charity Navigator.\n\nBorochoff suggested that Whitaker\u2019s board of directors at FACT didn\u2019t appear to be independent enough to apply the brakes on his campaign partisanship. Whitaker appeared to exert tight control over a three-person board of directors that included just one unsalaried member, according to the group\u2019s IRS filings in 2015-16.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s foundation was initially formed and then primarily supported with funds from another organization called Donor\u2019s Trust. That group is a nonprofit built to give conservative and libertarian philanthropists \u201cany level of privacy they want,\u201d according to its marketing materials.\n\nA FACT spokesman declined to provide any details on donors or any on-the-record response to other questions. There was no immediate reply to a request for comment from Whitaker made through the Justice Department.\n\nThough 501c3 groups can legally withhold the identity of their contributors and generally do so, there may be a distinct irony when a group dedicated to transparency keeps its funding sources in the shadows.\n\nIn 2014, FACT\u2019s only source of funds was Donor\u2019s Trust, according to IRS filings. In 2015, funds from Donor\u2019s Trust accounted for all but $191 of FACT\u2019s $500,191 in revenue. In 2016, Donor\u2019s Trust provided $800,000 of FACT\u2019s revenues of $1,350,265.\n\nIt is clear from IRS filings that FACT has paid outside Republican firms to perform some of its work. One such firm is America Rising LLC, which was given $144,000 for research in 2015.\n\nAmerica Rising LLC formed in Delaware in 2002 and was first registered to do business in Virginia in 2016, but its registration was canceled in May 2018 for failing to pay its annual registration fee, according to Katha Treanor, a spokeswoman for the State Corporation Commission. America Rising LLC did not respond to queries from The Associated Press.\n\n__\n\nAP writer Jeff Horwitz reported from Washington.", "President Donald Trump talks with reporters before departing for France on the South Lawn of the White House, Friday, Nov. 9, 2018, in Washington.

Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she was concerned by some of Whitaker\u2019s past comments and called for legislation that would place limits on his ability to fire Mueller. That would include specifying that only a Senate-confirmed Justice Department official, which Whitaker is not, could dismiss the special counsel.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is calling acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker \"a very highly respected man\" as he faces criticism about his appointment to replace Jeff Sessions. Yet Trump also said Friday \"I don't know Matt Whitaker.\" (Nov. 9)\n\nWhitaker, a Republican Party loyalist and chief of staff to just-ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was elevated Wednesday after Sessions was forced from his job by Trump.\n\nSince Wednesday, Whitaker has faced pressure from Democrats to step aside from overseeing Mueller, based on critical comments Whitaker made about the investigation before joining the Justice Department last year.\n\nWhitaker wrote an op-ed article saying Mueller would be straying outside his mandate if he investigated Trump family finances. Whitaker also gave a talk radio interview in which he maintained there was no evidence of collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign. He also tweeted an ex-prosecutor\u2019s opinion piece that described a \u201cMueller lynch mob\u201d and said it was \u201cworth a read.\u201d\n\nThere have been reports about Whitaker\u2019s past comments questioning the power and reach of the federal judiciary, and about his ties to an invention-promotion company that was accused of misleading consumers.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on Friday published an email revealing an FBI investigation into the company, World Patent Marketing Inc. The July 10, 2017, email was from an FBI victims\u2019 specialist to someone who, the newspaper said, was an alleged victim of the company. A Justice Department spokeswoman told the Journal that Whitaker was \u201cnot aware of any fraudulent activity.\u201d\n\nAlso Friday, The Associated Press reported that Whitaker repeatedly chided Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in public statements during 2016 while he was speaking for a group that is barred by its tax-exempt status from supporting or opposing political candidates during a campaign.\n\nWhitaker has tried to stay out of the public debate. He sent a department-wide note after his appointment in which he said, \u201cAs we move forward, I am committed to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans.\u201d\n\nLegal scholars are debating the constitutionality of his appointment. Some lawyers say it is illegal because he has not been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nEven as Trump seems to be distancing himself from Whitaker, two Republicans close to the president said Trump had enjoyed Whitaker\u2019s TV appearances and the two had struck a bond. Those TV appearances included one on CNN in which Whitaker suggested that the Mueller probe could be starved of resources.\n\nTrump told associates that he felt Whitaker would be \u201cloyal\u201d and would not have withdrawn from the Russia probe, as Sessions had done, according to the Republicans. They were not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump said Friday he had not spoken with Whitaker about Mueller\u2019s investigation, which until now has been overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

At the end of the metro line, migrants began making their way to a main highway to resume walking and hitching rides with the tacit approval of Mexican officials.\n\nNear a major toll plaza about 19 miles (30 kilometers) north of the city, Mexico state police and human rights officials helped load men, women and children onto eighteen-wheelers and asked passing buses and trucks if they would carry migrants.\n\nMaria Yesenia Perez, a 41-year-old who left La Ceiba, Honduras nearly a month ago with her 8-year-old daughter, said she was prepared to wait to gain entry at the U.S. border.\n\n\u201cI decided to come (with the caravan) to help my family,\u201d she said, before she and her daughter were hoisted onto the back of a semitrailer.\n\nPerez is now one of roughly 4,000 migrants who proceeded to Queretaro \u2014 a state capital 124 miles (200 kilometers) to northwest of Mexico City\u2014 and then possibly to Guadalajara, Culiacan, Hermosillo and eventually Tijuana on the U.S. border.\n\nWhereas migrants like her carried tiny knapsacks with bare essentials in Mexico\u2019s tropical south, however, their belongings swelled noticeably after a multiday stop in Mexico City.\n\nMany are now hauling bundles of blankets, sleeping bags and heavy clothing to protect against colder temperatures in the northern part of the country. Some left the capital with bottles of water and clear plastic bags of bananas and oranges for the long trek. Others were given juice and ham sandwiches from volunteers as they set out.\n\nAstrid Daniela Aguilar, who was traveling with two cousins aged 3 and 4, lined up alongside the highway to await a chance at hitching a ride.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t find work there,\u201d she said of her home country of Honduras.\n\nWhen they arrived in the stadium that Queretaro officials had prepared for them, they began getting ready for the night. Some set up tents, others found shelter beneath its concourse.\n\nVolunteers offered sandwiches, tortillas and rice to the travelers.\n\nThe caravan planned to leave Queretaro for Irapuato about 62 miles (100 kilometers) to the west at 5 a.m. Sunday.\n\nThe caravan became a campaign issue in U.S. midterm elections and U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of over 5,000 military troops to the border to fend off the migrants. Trump has also insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nMany migrants say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, and they have now been on the road for weeks.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.N. rejected a demand by caravan representatives for buses to the border, saying its agencies were \u201cunable to provide the transportation demanded by some members of the caravan.\u201d\n\nMexico City is more than 600 miles from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas, but the area around the Mexican border cities of Reynosa, Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo is rife with drug gangs and the migrants consider it too risky.\n\nMigrants are now taking a still perilous, but somewhat safer and longer route to Tijuana in Mexico\u2019s far northwest, across from San Diego.\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum or work visas to the migrants, and its government said 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them while they wait for the 45-day application process for a more permanent status.\n\nBut most vowed to continue to the United States.\n\nGiselle Owen, a 15-year-old from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, belted out romantic ballads as the day\u2019s journey got underway.\n\n\u201cIt relaxes me and I feel like I don\u2019t get tired,\u201d she said. \u201cI can walk hours singing.\u201d\n\nOthers got ahead by taking rides from friendly Mexicans.\n\nAngelica Martinez saw David Rodriguez pushing his friend Rafael Peralta of San Pedro Sula, Honduras down the side of the highway in a wheelchair.\n\nShe stopped in a lane of the highway to load the two migrants and the wheelchair into her small Volkswagen hatchback and said she would take them as far as she was going up the road.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Maria Verza contributed to this report.", "EATONTON, Ga. (AP) \u2014 On a crisp late October morning, Drew Copeland and a team of helpers hung a hundred-pound buck from the ceiling of his shed and sliced open its torso. A pile of organs and blood spilled onto the cement floor.\n\n\u201cWe wash and clean a lot,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nCopeland\u2019s not afraid of grime and guts. Since he opened The Meat Shed in Eatonton five years ago, he\u2019s butchered thousands of deer and hogs. Copeland often chops up 40 deer in a day during rifle season.\n\nCopeland likes to keep his workplace pristine, but with the constant stream of fresh meat flowing in and out of coolers and grinders, it\u2019s hard to keep up.\n\n\u201cThis room won\u2019t look like this in a little while. It\u2019ll be ugly in here in a little bit,\u201d he said as he butchered a mound of deer meat at a cutting table. \u201cBut, by the time we get finished this afternoon, there\u2019ll be pieces of meat on the floor and, you know, just stuff everywhere, and then every morning it starts back over just like this.\u201d\n\nDeer season is a hectic time for The Meat Shed, which processed 1,600 deer last year. But it\u2019s not just the promise of profits that keeps Copeland up to his elbows in venison from October through January.\n\nThe Meat Shed processes an extra 750 to 1,000 pounds of deer meat each year to donate to Georgia Hunters for the Hungry, an initiative of the Georgia Wildlife Federation that contributes free venison to food pantries and soup kitchens across the state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been blessed with a whole lot over here,\u201d Copeland said. \u201cSo it\u2019s nice to do a little bit for somebody else too.\u201d\n\nThe struggle to feed Georgia\u2019s hungry\n\nSince 1993, hunters have provided over 1.5 million meals to Georgians in need.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got these parents calling, saying, \u2018I just need to feed my family. My family needs protein,\u2019\u201d said Sam Stowe, sportsmen program manager for the Georgia Wildlife Federation. \u201cSo, you know, that\u2019s what kind of drives me to continue the program. Because I do see the need out there.\u201d\n\nOne in seven Georgians struggles with hunger, according to Feeding America. More than 500,000 of them are children.\n\nFood banks supply Georgia\u2019s 1.6 million hungry residents with canned goods, dried grains and other pantry staples, but they rarely offer high-protein options, like meat.\n\nGeorgia Hunters for the Hungry aims to bridge that gap.\n\nVenison is an ideal option to nourish the food insecure, because it\u2019s high in protein and low in fat, Stowe said.\n\n\u201cWe have the food banks calling us wanting more, wanting more every year,\u201d he said.\n\nStowe coordinates with about 20 meat processors throughout the state who accept donations on behalf of the organization. He\u2019s spent years recruiting more hunters and meat processors to help to fill Georgia\u2019s ever-growing need for protein.\n\nResources are limited, though.\n\nThe Georgia Wildlife Federation reimburses processors $1.50 for each pound of meat they butcher. Once the meat is ground up and packaged, it\u2019s delivered to the Georgia Food Bank Association, which distributes the venison to communities across the state.\n\nFunding is the program\u2019s greatest challenge, Stowe said. The nonprofit organization runs on individual donations and grants from the Walmart Foundation, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and a handful of other funders.\n\nBut when the economy slumps, financing can be hard to find.\n\nThe program faltered for several years during the Great Recession, when donations fell short. Years later, Stowe still struggles each year to keep the organization afloat.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so many dollars in the coffer that you\u2019re able to allot that dollar-and-a-half a pound,\u201d Stowe said, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s my problem. We\u2019re not having more processors, because we run out of money to pay the guys with.\u201d\n\nStowe\u2019s committed to growing the program, though. Eventually, he hopes to partner with processors in all 159 counties.\n\nThe organization benefits both the hungry and the hunters, Stowe said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a way that hunters can really feel good about their hunting and the fact that they are helping these families,\u201d he said.\n\nAdam Schiavone donates at least a deer or two each season. Most of his family and friends do, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a good way to help give back to the community doing something that we love to do,\u201d said Schiavone, wildlife technician and volunteer coordinator for the Georgia Wildlife Foundation.\n\nSchiavone started hunting when he was seven or eight years old, and he cherishes the quiet hours he spends in the woods, waiting for prey to pass by.\n\n\u201cI just enjoy getting out, watching the sunrise, listening to animals come out or wake up,\u201d Schiavone said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of unique things that most people don\u2019t get to see.\u201d\n\nThe fresh meat is just an added bonus, Schiavone said. He fills his freezer with venison every year.\n\nOnce Schiavone\u2019s shelves are stocked, he gives the rest to others in need.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always going to have the problem where people need food,\u201d Schiavone said. \u201cProtein\u2019s one of the hardest things for the food banks and soup shelters to get. And it\u2019s just an easy way for hunters to help solve that problem.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s what we\u2019re called to do\u2019\n\nCopeland knows the impact that donated meat can have. Much of the venison donated to The Meat Shed goes to Cafe Central, a free hot meal served each Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Freedom Church in Milledgeville.\n\nCopeland is a regular volunteer at his congregation\u2019s soup kitchen, and he gives as much meat as he can, even when he exceeds his 750-pound limit for reimbursement.\n\nIt costs Copeland $25 to $30 out of pocket to process each donated deer. He doesn\u2019t mind eating the extra expenses, though.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me what I get paid for,\u201d Copeland said. \u201cI like to do the program.\u201d\n\nSeeing those in need eating the meat he\u2019s donated is payoff enough for Copeland.\n\n\u201cWe can dump money all over the place and, you know, we can hand money to a guy on the street, but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s actually going to eat with that money,\u201d Copeland said. \u201cBut, I know if I\u2019m putting food somewhere that it\u2019s actually getting in somebody\u2019s belly.\u201d\n\nDonations from The Meat Shed lasted Cafe Central through the whole winter last year, said Executive Chef Jim Humphries. Humphries used the 400 pounds of ground meat in soups, chilis and hamburger patties mixed with beef.\n\n\u201cIt helps us save money, because that\u2019s free protein to us that we don\u2019t have to pay for,\u201d Humphries said. \u201cSo we can use money in other areas to buy more food, whether it\u2019s to give out in our canned goods or actually for cooking purposes.\u201d\n\nHumphries was nervous to incorporate venison into his menus at first, fearing his visitors wouldn\u2019t like the unfamiliar taste. But when he mixes it in with beef, no one really seems to notice. They\u2019re just glad they have something filling and warm to eat.\n\n\u201cBeing able to provide a free hot meal once a week is vital,\u201d Humphries said. \u201cAnd then at the same time, and in all honesty from my personal beliefs, it\u2019s what we\u2019re called to do, is to turn around and serve others who are less fortunate in the community and need help.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Telegraph, http://www.macontelegraph.com", "Two years of age separate brothers Curtis Cochran and Roy Gunter, but it took 63 years of life for the pair to meet.\n\nOne brother wanted to answer questions about his family history, and one was taken by surprise when he was the answer. Both think their Ancestry.com DNA tests provided a solid return on investment.\n\nRoy \u201cChip\u201d Gunter, 63, took the first DNA test after his children gave him an Ancestry.com kit for Christmas in 2017.\n\nGunter, the former sheriff of West Carroll Parish, wanted to take the test out of curiosity about his ancestry. He was looking for the big picture of historical migration of his ancestors, not an in-depth search for distant cousins or long-lost family.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a horrible sweater. I sweat like crazy,\u201d Gunter said. \u201cI said my people have got to be from Scandinavia. That\u2019s the first thing that popped into my mind. Sure enough, Scandinavia, Ireland, Scotland and around through there, and honestly, that was all I was curious about \u2014 just to see where they were from, just to verify what I was thinking.\u201d\n\nIt took about six weeks for Gunter, now a West Monroe resident, to receive his results. He put them aside after learning what he wanted to know until they popped back up several months later.\n\n\u201cI always told myself I wasn\u2019t going to look for my birth parents or relatives until after my parents passed away because I didn\u2019t want to hurt their feelings in any way,\u201d said Curtis Cochran, 65. \u201cLast fall, my father \u2014 my mother had been gone for 19 years \u2014 passed away in September (2017) at 99.\u201d\n\nIn Fort Worth, Cochran signed-up for Ancestry.com in April. He was adopted immediately after his birth in 1953. He registered with Ancestry.com to learn more about his family history.\n\nAt a minimum, he wanted to know more about their health so he could finally answer doctors\u2019 questions regarding a family medical history, but he also hoped to find out who his birth family was and his own personal history.\n\n\u201cI joined it and waited for the results and, \u2018boop,\u2019 out pops a close match,\u201d Cochran said.\n\nAt first, the match seemed to be a cousin but additional research into the DNA results pointed to a more direct link. The possible options were grandfather, uncle or half-sibling, and Cochran started reaching out to Gunter to pinpoint the connection.\n\nBefore he sent the first email, Cochran felt it might be an awkward situation for the family on the other side. He knew he was adopted, but he didn\u2019t know if anyone else was aware he existed.\n\nWhen Gunter initially responded, he was vague. He had never considered the possibility of a relative tracking him down through his DNA submission and said he was concerned the emails might be a scam.\n\n\u201cThe third time he contacted me, he said: \u2018You don\u2019t have any idea how close related we are, do you?\u2019\u201d Gunter recounted. \u201cI said, \u2018Not a clue. None.\u2019 He said \u2018According to our DNA, we are half-brothers.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d was the word that followed in Gunter\u2019s mind as conversations accelerated, and he discussed the possibility of a half-brother with his sister.\n\nThe two started looking at their father\u2019s life after he left college at LSU and joined the Air Force. At some point, their father, also named Roy Gunter, returned home to northeast Louisiana and Cochran was conceived. The doctor who would later deliver Cochran played cards with his adoptive father, Gunter said.\n\nCochran was born in 1953. In 1954, Gunter\u2019s parents married, and Gunter was born in 1955.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Dad knew,\u201d Gunter continued, \u201cbecause he was terminal for a year and a half. I feel like if he would have known, he would have said something to my sister and I. Not a word. This came totally out of left field.\u201d\n\nAs Cochran and Gunter continued to email and later began to converse over the phone, Cochran also tracked down his maternal family through a cousin match but found his birth mother had also died.\n\nCochran has spoken to a half-sister by his birth mother on the telephone in addition to reaching out to Gunter.\n\nIn mid-October, the two brothers met at a Cracker Barrel restaurant in Longview, Texas. Both describe the meeting as surreal and say the similarities don\u2019t stop there.\n\n\u201cWhen I was sitting across the table looking at him, it was like I was looking into my dad\u2019s eyes,\u201d Gunter said. \u201cIt was \u2018boom,\u2019 and I was going \u2018This is plum spooky.\u2019\u201d\n\nCochran said there a lot of funny details personality-wise that match up, like a love of yard work and high energy levels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like meeting a friend,\u201d Cochran said. \u201cBecause you haven\u2019t met this person ever in your life, but you have all of this in common. The more we talked (I thought) \u2018I can\u2019t believe he does this and this, because it sounds just like me.\u2019 ... Even though we grew up in two different states, two different environments, it\u2019s that gene pool that comes out in the end.\u201d\n\nGunter said the pair regularly message each other now and speak, and he is sure they will be reconnecting in the future.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how happy I am to find him, or for him to find me is the proper terminology,\u201d Gunter said. \u201cI think it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nCochran said it\u2019s important for adopted children to realize the journey to find out more about themselves doesn\u2019t change who they are.\n\n\u201cYour parents are always going to be your parents, and I wasn\u2019t ever going to replace them, regardless of if the birth parents are alive or not,\u201d Cochran said. \u201d...They were the ones who were there for me every day, helped raise me, sent me to college and supported me in good and bad.\u201d\n\nHe encourages anyone in his position to take advantage of the DNA registries that are available to answer any questions they have had in the back of their mind for years.\n\n\u201cThey might not like the results,\u201d Cochran said, \u201cThey may be very pleased and fortunate like I was, but to at least know about their history as far as health and also for their children\u2019s benefit on what to look for and what not to look for, I think is invaluable. ... And you may get lucky and find a brother like Chip.\u201d", "In this Oct. 30, 2018 photo, Joshua Perkins takes in the view from the top of Waterrock Knob on the Blue Ridge Parkway in Maggie Valley, N.C., as he hikes with Pathways to Parks. Pathways to Parks is an outdoors group that aims to get more people of color outside and enjoying National Parks. (Angeli Wright/The Asheville Citizen-Times via AP)\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 There were some sketchy moments as Tanya Cummings thought her self-described \u201cshort, little legs,\u201d wouldn\u2019t get her up and over the boulders way taller than her 4-foot-11, well-coiffed and manicured frame, or out of the deep woods in the Plott Balsam Mountains.\n\nBut with her two trusty walking sticks (which she sometimes tossed aside, saying \u201cI don\u2019t need you\u201d before grabbing for them again), a Super Girl determination in those \u201clittle legs\u201d and occasionally a \u201cHelp me!\u201d directed at her boyfriend, Larry Pender, Cummings came through the \u201chike of her life\u201d actually squealing with delight, and with not a single cracked fingernail.\n\nShe and a group of five members of the brand-new Pathways to Parks, a nature outing club formed with the seemingly simple mission of getting people of color outdoors and into national parks, took on their most challenging hike to date on Oct. 30 at Waterrock Knob in the Haywood County area of the Blue Ridge Parkway.\n\nIt was only 3.5 miles round-trip, but there was plenty of climbing as the group \u2014 accompanied by a Citizen-Times reporter and photographer \u2014 made their way through a spruce-fir forest to the 6,292-foot Waterrock Knob summit, and then on to the 6,250-foot-high Browning Knob.\n\nThey trekked over single-track trails riddled with mud holes, rocks covered in ice and clambered over boulders that required the use of two arms, two legs to scale, along with an occasional a push from a friend.\n\nThe day was cold to start, but piercingly clear. The fall color was muted to brown and green, with an occasional pop of red and orange on the Blue Ridge horizon. It was such a spectacular fall day that even though it was a Tuesday, and the fall foliage was lacking in luster, many people of all ages made their way up to the Waterrock Knob Summit to gasp at the views.\n\nWhen the group stopped for their first rest, Cummings, 66, who retired to Horse Shoe after 36 years working for the federal government in California, asked a question.\n\n\u201cOut of all the people we met today, how many of them were people of color?\u201d The obvious answer, other than those in the Pathways to Parks group, was zero.\n\nHence the need, she said, for such a group, although she knows the challenge of breaking stereotypes and long-held social \u201cnorms\u201d is much harder than climbing a 6,000-foot mountain.\n\nLast March, Cummings and her friends Flo Mayberry, a retired University of California Berkeley librarian who now lives in Bat Cave, and Kathy Avery, Kathey Avery, a nurse with the Asheville Buncombe Institute of Parity Achievement, attended a UNC Asheville lecture by Audrey Peterman and her husband, Frank.\n\n\u201cThey were on fire,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cMeeting them changed my life.\u201d\n\nThe Petermans\u2019 talk focused on how they fell in love with the national parks in 1995 after their youngest child moved away and they were Florida empty-nesters. They bought a Ford truck and traveled 12,500 miles across 40 states in two months, visiting national parks from the Smokies to Yosemite to the Badlands to Olympic.\n\n\u201cIn Yellowstone it struck us, all these hundreds of thousands of people we\u2019re seeing in national parks, they have one thing in common \u2014 they\u2019re all white. What happened?\u201d Audrey Peterman said at her UNCA talk in March. \u201cIn the entire time, we counted four black people from coast to coast in the national parks.\u201d\n\nThe sorry statistics bear out in Western North Carolina, rich in public lands that are free to everyone, including Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the most visited of all national parks, and the Blue Ridge Parkway, with 16.1 million visitors last year, the most popular unit in the National Park Service.\n\nYet visitor-use studies show 97 percent of those visitors are white.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census, 13 percent of Americans are black or African-American, 18 percent are Hispanic, nearly 6 percent are Asian and American Indians 1.3 percent.\n\nPeterman said she recognized there was a mountain-sized lack of information inside the black community about these public lands that belonged to all Americans, and launched Earthwise Productions, Inc., an environmental consulting and publishing firm focused on connecting people to the public lands system.\n\nHer talk lit a fire under Cummings, Mayberry and Avery, who with George Ivey of the North Carolina Arboretum and Tony Beurskens of Conserving Carolina, started a group to carry on the Peterman\u2019s message of bringing people of color to the parks.\n\nThey started with short hikes that included Craggy Gardens on the parkway and the Wild Cat Rock Trail in the Hickory Nut Gorge. They gathered more members, now up to 13, came up with a name, and built up to more ambitious hikes.\n\nPender, 66, a retired administrator from New York University, scouted the trail, including the 1.4-mile round-trip side trail the group hiked off the Waterrock Knob Trail to see the remains of a Cessna that crashed in 1983 - a big surprise for the group - where Cummings said a blessing for the two people who died there.\n\nPender said he grew up on a tobacco farm in Wilson, North Carolina, hunting rabbits and exploring with his brother in the woods, day and night. After living in New York City for so long, he didn\u2019t realize how big the outdoor racial divide was until he moved back to WNC six years ago.\n\nWhy does he think there is such disparity in who enjoys the outdoors?\n\n\u201cSome may not be able to afford it. It\u2019s free, but you have to drive here,\u201d Pender said of the parkway hike with no entrance fee, but nearly an hour\u2019s drive from Asheville.\n\n\u201cWhat about people who don\u2019t have a car or who can\u2019t afford the gas to get here? Or people who work all week and want to relax on the weekend and see this as work.\u201d\n\nJoshua Perkins, 22, originally from Dallas, Texas, graduated in May with a degree in environmental education from Warren Wilson College and is now the community engagement specialist for the N.C. Arboretum. He was on his first hike with Pathways to Parks last week.\n\nBeing an African-American who likes to hike, backpack and rock climb, he said he is sometimes teased by friends for \u201cacting white\u201d for taking part in those activities.\n\n\u201cThat just sounds silly. The outdoors are for everyone, not just white people,\u201d said Perkins, a cellist, who said his passion for the outdoors began as a child while attending music camp in the mountains of New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cI told myself then, \u2018I want to engulf myself in the outdoors. I want to do something to benefit the environment,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nHe tries to get friends, especially black friends, to hike or rock climb with him, but it\u2019s difficult.\n\n\u201cWe have a stereotype that black people shouldn\u2019t be outdoors. We should be inside and minding our own business. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at all. Black people can have a sense of appreciation for the outdoors like white people. We have to get rid of that stereotype,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get outdoors on your own, join groups like this one and carpool.\u201d\n\nThe overall day was \u201cquiet and peaceful. Nice being outside the office and actually spending time outdoors,\u201d he said\n\nElsea Brown, 26, of Asheville, is the director of Blue Ridge Forever, a nonprofit consortium of land trusts.\n\n\u201cI see this as a movement,\u201d she said of Pathways to Parks, \u201cespecially in Asheville where we have such beautiful opportunities to be outside, it was really exciting to be able to do that with people who look like me, because a lot of times that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\nEven though at times on the hike Brown was alternately hot, sweaty, freezing, out of breath, hungry, or falling into mud, she said the camaraderie of the group, and Cummings\u2019 lighthearted way of cracking everyone up made the day full of fun.\n\n\u201cTanya was always bright and shiny. She\u2019s someone I look up to,\u201d Brown said.\n\nCummings said hiking and spending time outdoors, whether it\u2019s birding, strolling in a state park or having an outdoor picnic, is important, especially for people of color.\n\n\u201cPeople of color have a high rate of diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Doctors are now prescribing nature as a way of healing people from stress. I think that if more people of color would take advantage of health benefits that nature offers, they\u2019d be more focused on their physical and mental well-being,\u201d Cummings said.\n\nShe has big hopes for Pathways to Parks. She is recruiting members and hike leaders, no matter what race, to join the club, as long as the commit to the mission \u201cof getting people of color out to our national parks,\u201d is planning a trip to the Grand Canyon next year, and she hopes to eventually have a national membership.\n\nBrown said she can see that in the future, but with baby steps, such as asking people who have never been hiking to go first to a waterfall where you can drive and walk on a short, paved trail.

Neville had contributed to the Stones\u2019 then-current \u201cVoodoo Lounge\u201d album; he also was a member of Richards\u2019 solo band, the X-Pensive Winos.\n\nIf the Giants Stadium show went well, he might have been offered a larger role with the Rolling Stones.\n\nIt didn\u2019t.\n\nShortly after the backstage photo was snapped, Neville, drunk and high on cocaine, threw up in a bathroom and passed out, alone, in a dressing room. When he woke up, the show was over.\n\n\u201cIt was a big blunder,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI blew it.\u201d\n\nNow 20 years sober, he is still shocked by his appearance in that long-ago photo. \u201cI look green,\u201d he said. \u201cSo out of it.\u201d\n\nNeville shared the photo and discussed his journey to sobriety during a workshop at Imagine Recovery, an Uptown treatment center. The session was presented by Send Me a Friend, an initiative co-founded by guitarist Anders Osborne to support musicians in recovery.\n\nThe talk was led by Harold Owens, the senior director of MusiCares, the Grammy organization\u2019s charitable arm. Within the music industry, he is a rock star of recovery. During his nearly 20 years with MusiCares, Owens, a recovering addict himself, has assisted scores of famous and not-so-famous musicians.\n\nHe supplied critical friendship and support in the early stages of Neville\u2019s sobriety. A decade later, Neville and Owens aided Osborne in his own recovery.\n\nAll three are committed to helping musicians who struggle with substance abuse in an especially challenging environment, where partying is often perceived as part of the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll lifestyle.\n\nBut getting and staying sober, while difficult, is possible. Neville and Osborne are living proof.\n\n\u201cThere is a process. It is a challenge, but you can do it,\u201d Owens said. \u201cThere are folks like Anders and Ivan who show that you can do it, and here\u2019s how.\n\n\u201cBoth of these men, when they hear about somebody that needs help, will call. It\u2019s been a really rewarding relationship.\u201d\n\nAs the son of Aaron Neville and the nephew of Art, Charles and Cyril, Ivan Neville grew up in New Orleans music. He also was exposed to drugs and alcohol at a young age. He smoked his first joint at age 11.\n\nBy the time he was 18, he was drinking and/or using drugs daily. He didn\u2019t stop for two decades, even as he released acclaimed solo albums, joined the aptly named X-Pensive Winos and toured as a member of 1990s alternative rock band the Spin Doctors.\n\nSubstance abuse affects people in all professions. But in the music industry, \u201cyou think it goes with the territory, and you get a free pass to do that,\u201d Neville said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought as a youngster: I get to get loaded for the rest of my life and don\u2019t have to deal with the responsibilities most people have.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut even Keith Richards, no stranger to drugs and alcohol himself, was spooked by Neville\u2019s addictions.\n\n\u201cKeith hated that I was smoking crack,\u201d Neville said. \u201cHe\u2019d look at me like, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with you? Get it together.\u2019\u201d\n\nNeville made several attempts at rehab; none took until he entered Las Encinas Hospital in Pasadena, California, in the wee hours of Aug. 14, 1998. He spent 28 days in the program.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a drink or any mind-altering drug since,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had nothing stronger than a Tylenol or Advil. It was what they call the Big Surrender. I joined the winning side.\u201d\n\nEarly in his recovery, he got in touch with Owens.\n\n\u201cHarold is somebody I saw in the trenches at meetings in Los Angeles,\u201d Neville said. \u201cHe was helping a lot of people. A friendship developed between us. He\u2019s a walking example of a righteous person.\u201d\n\nNeville knows first hand about the frustrations, doubts and misgivings faced by musicians contemplating sobriety.\n\n\u201cBack in the day, I was on coke and drinking and thought that was helping my already semi-genius-level mind and creativity,\u201d he said. After first getting sober, \u201cI was like, \u2018How am I going to play? How am I going to be able to write songs?\u2019 But then I got a clear mind and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s how you do it. I can think and feel (stuff). It\u2019s all there. It\u2019s always been there.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a process to realize what you\u2019re capable of doing without mind-altering things. I started reaping the rewards of not being (messed) up. I immediately noticed I was playing better. I was writing songs like nobody\u2019s business. I realized I was more creative. I started to appreciate the little butterflies I might get in my stomach before shows. I started loving doing what I do.\u201d\n\nHe did his homework. His first sober tour was a European trek with the Spin Doctors. Before leaving, he looked up the locations of 12-step meetings in cities on the itinerary. \u201cI was prepared. I knew the kind of situations I might be going into.\u201d\n\nIn Munich, Germany, he walked by Oktoberfest celebrants on the way to a meeting, which was conducted in German.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t understand anything they were saying, but I knew I was where I was supposed to be,\u201d Neville said. \u201cWhatever they were saying, they were talking my language.\u201d\n\nThe promoter of a Spin Doctors show in Portugal hosted a party at a bar stocked with high-end port wines. \u201cI\u2019m sitting there with my 7-Up, eating cheese and crackers,\u201d Neville said. \u201cI felt a little odd as everybody else is drinking wine. The promoter kept asking me, \u2018Why you not drinking?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018I had enough.\u2019 He said, \u2018What do you mean? I haven\u2019t seen you drink anything.\u2019 I said, \u2018Look, believe me, I had enough.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat was my first experience on the road (sober), and I got through it. That gave me confidence that I could do this.\u201d\n\nStill, he was scared to move back to New Orleans, with its culture of indulgence. \u201cI knew some people in recovery, and reached out to them. I scheduled everything I did around something to do with recovery, to stay safe, to go to meetings.\u201d\n\nAt the Grammy Awards, he would duck into the backstage \u201cSafe Harbor Room,\u201d where 12-step meetings were conducted for musicians and the show\u2019s production staff. He attended 12-step meetings at the Bonnaroo festival and aboard ship during \u201cjam cruises.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo there are safe places to go when you\u2019re in the midst of a lot of madness,\u201d Neville said. \u201cIt can be done.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a walking example of, if this guy can do it, anybody can do it. A lot of people didn\u2019t think I was going to make it. I wasn\u2019t one of the most-likely-to-succeed kind of guys. I wasn\u2019t some garden-variety alcoholic that had a few drinks and got in trouble. I was doing drugs and drinking every day for years.\u201d\n\nOsborne also was an extreme case. A native of Sweden who first rambled his way to New Orleans in the late 1980s, he built a successful career as a roots-rock/jam band guitarist, singer and songwriter. A song he co-wrote, \u201cWatch the Wind Blow By,\u201d was a No. 1 country hit for Tim McGraw.\n\nBut Osborne\u2019s drug and alcohol use accelerated nearly to the point of no return. By the late 2000s, he was out of control, and he knew it.\n\n\u201cIn the last year or so of my use, I kept reaching out to people,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re coming down or you\u2019re feeling really depressed, you isolate a lot, but you also throw out these little calls for help. Ivan was one of my calls pretty regularly.\n\n\u201cWe made a really nice connection; I knew as it was happening, even though I was messed up, that he was going out of his way. He took a couple of my calls while he was standing onstage. That shows you the dedication to helping each other that the program has.\u201d\n\nAs Osborne bottomed out in late 2008, his manager at the time, Rueben Williams, spoke to Neville. Neville in turn contacted Owens, who arranged for Osborne to be admitted to New Perception, a rehab facility in Los Angeles, in January 2009.\n\nOwens \u201cis deeply involved in all kinds of healing,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cHe was part of saving my life and getting me clean.\u201d\n\nWhen Osborne first got sober, some people advised him to change careers or stay out of venues that served alcohol. That wasn\u2019t an option for him. \u201cI barely finished high school \u2014 what else am I going to do (other than play music)? I\u2019m an expert at this. This is how I make money.\u201d\n\nTo support musicians in recovery as they get back to work, Osborne and Bill Taylor, an administrator at music-related nonprofits, founded Send Me a Friend as a project of the local Positive Vibrations Foundation. Send Me a Friend established a national network of \u201csober friends\u201d to accompany touring musician and music industry personnel at shows.\n\nAs they launched Send Me a Friend, Osborne and Taylor often consulted with Owens. \u201cHe has so much experience and he\u2019s so knowledgeable and connected,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great adviser on anything related to healing and sobriety. The list is endless, what he has done.\u201d\n\nOwens understands how difficult it can be for musicians to make the decision to get sober.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very frightening process to ask musicians to stop using drugs and alcohol and take a look at what sobriety will mean for you,\u201d Owens said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard musicians say, \u2018I can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m going back into the same environment.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t stay sober by yourself. You need people. I needed people when I got sober. I still have people around me. I may not need them but I want them in my life. It is vital that people have that.\u201d\n\nThe event with Owens and Neville was the third installment of Send Me a Friend\u2019s \u201cLifeshop\u201d series, workshops intended to help \u201ccreative sober people come together to share ideas, inspiration and learn new tools to stay creative, happy and connected.\u201d It was sponsored by the Gia Maione Prima Foundation, named for the widow of famed New Orleans entertainer Louis Prima.\n\n\u201cWe invited Harold and Ivan because they\u2019re so closely connected to both me and Bill\u2019s recovery,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cThey have so much to offer. Ivan is an iconic figure. It\u2019s really powerful to have a person like that tell you his story.\u201d\n\nLooking back, Neville is thankful he screwed up his audition with the Rolling Stones in 1994. \u201cI might have been dead if I had got that gig,\u201d he said. ...\n\nOwens tells another story that shows just how far Neville has come.\n\nA few years ago, Owens was sitting with Neville and Paul McCartney at the Grammy ceremony at Los Angeles\u2019 Staples Center. The road manager for a legendary artist scheduled to perform during the show approached their table and asked Neville if he was familiar with the legend\u2019s music.\n\nYes, he was. Why?\n\nThe artist in question, struggling with his own addiction, had disappeared somewhere in the Staples Center. Neville might be needed to fill in for him at the last minute.\n\nThe irony of that moment is not lost on Owens: \u201cFor somebody to ask Ivan to perform for somebody else who couldn\u2019t ... it\u2019s come full circle.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Advocate, http://theadvocate.com", "GREELEY, Colo.

Caris LeVert made sure the Nuggets didn\u2019t have an opportunity to win in overtime, either.\n\nLeVert hit a floater in the lane with 0.3 seconds left, and the Brooklyn Nets scored the last six points of the game to beat the Nuggets 112-110 on Friday night.\n\n\u201cTo have the ball and everybody get out of the way, that\u2019s a great feeling to have as a player,\u201d LeVert said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you dream about as a kid.\u201d\n\nAtkinson put the ball in his hands and let the former Michigan star go to work.\n\n\u201cWe wanted the last shot. We didn\u2019t want to mess around with them having 4 seconds or 3 seconds so the fact that we left them with 0.3 is what we wanted,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cThat\u2019s the best way to control it. It\u2019s an (isolation) but, heck, that\u2019s what the kid\u2019s good at. They pressured him, he got by and made a heck of a shot.\u201d\n\nThe Nets overcame a big bounce-back night from Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic to win their third straight. In an offensive funk for the last four games, Jokic had a season-high 37 points and tied his career best with 21 rebounds.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t enough to prevent Denver\u2019s first home loss of the season, thanks to LeVert\u2019s heroics. His defense helped hold Gary Harris to four points on 1-of-11 shooting, and then he beat his former Big Ten rival at the end.\n\nJokic took only one shot Wednesday night in a loss to Memphis, a 3-pointer in the final seconds that would have given Denver the win. He took only 18 shots in the first four games of November but topped that before the end of the third quarter.\n\nHe had 11 points in the first quarter and a double-double with 20 points and 12 rebounds at halftime.\n\n\u201cHe was just aggressive,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cHe took advantage of some chances.\u201d\n\nJokic, normally jovial in postgame interviews, was subdued after Friday\u2019s loss. He said he didn\u2019t lack confidence in Memphis and said about Friday\u2019s game that he \u201cwas feeling the ball tonight.\u201d\n\nDenver appeared to take control after Jokic blocked Jarrett Allen, grabbed the rebound and fed Malik Beasley for a layup and a 108-106 lead with 1:23 left. After a Brooklyn miss, Paul Millsap\u2019s two free throws made it a four-point game.\n\nThe Nets tied it with 29 seconds left and Jokic was called for traveling with 22 seconds left.\n\nLeVert got the ball up top and was blanketed by Harris. He broke through the tight defense to get into the lane and hit a soft lob to give Brooklyn the win.\n\n\u201cI just tried to get the last shot and get the kind of shot I wanted to get,\u201d LeVert said of Harris \u201cI thought he was going to scoot back at one point but he kind of pressed up the whole time.

(AP) \u2014 Oregon State is still getting used to playing with point guard Destiny Slocum, still learning to anticipate her speed and passes.\n\n\u201cEach day, we\u2019re getting more comfortable together,\u201d guard Mikayla Pivec said.\n\nThey seemed pretty comfortable in their season opener Friday night as Slocum had 15 points in her Oregon State debut, leading the eighth-ranked Beavers to a 79-54 victory over Cal Poly.\n\n\u201cBeing able to be out there with my team today, I couldn\u2019t ask for anything (more),\u201d said Slocum, who made four 3-pointers and also had eight assists.\n\nSlocum was the national freshman of the year at Maryland two years ago.

Still, the Beavers shot 49 percent, including 12 for 30 on 3-pointers, while holding Cal Poly to 37 percent shooting.\n\nCal Poly coach Faith Mimnaugh said that transition defense let her squad down, but added that Oregon State has the talent to be elite again this season.\n\n\u201cAs good as they were last year, I think they\u2019re even better with Slocum in their lineup. She just weaved and wiggled and did whatever she wanted on the court and set up her shooters all around her. She was fabulous,\u201d Mimnaugh said.\n\nThe Beavers led 23-12 at the end of the first quarter thanks to an 8-0 run, capped by an Aleah Goodman 3-pointer that came 3 seconds before the buzzer.\n\nOregon State led 36-24 at the break.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Oregon State pushed the lead to 27 points.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nCal Poly: Stanback, a senior center, averaged 8.2 points per game last season.

There are plenty of new faces for Mimnaugh.\n\n\u201cWe need our freshmen to act like sophomores pretty quick,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are really going to have to step up. But that\u2019s a great opportunity, too.\u201d\n\nVERSATILITY\n\nRueck said that one of the strengths of Oregon State is the team\u2019s and players\u2019 versatility.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s just who we are. We are going to have to play both small and big,\u201d he added.\n\nAgainst Cal Poly, the Beavers went small, and 6-foot-1 guard/forward Maddie Washington ended up playing minutes at center - where she hasn\u2019t even played at practice all season. \u201cIt just seemed like the right thing to do,\u201d Rueck said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCal Poly: At Sacramento State on Sunday.\n\nOregon State: Hosts Arkansas-Pine Bluff on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "HONOLULU (AP) \u2014 Freshman guard Umoja Gibson poured in 27 points, hitting all six of his 3-point attempts along the way, and North Texas breezed to a 93-48 victory over Division II-member Humboldt State in the Rainbow Classic on Friday night.\n\nGibson hit 10 of his 13 shots, handed out five assists and added four steals.

(AP) \u2014 The Florida secretary of state ordered recounts in the U.S. Senate and governor races on Saturday, an unprecedented review of two major contests in the state that took five weeks to decide the 2000 presidential election.\n\nSecretary Ken Detzner issued the order after the unofficial results in both races fell within the margin that by law triggers a recount. His office was unaware of any other time either a race for governor or U.S. Senate in Florida required a recount, let alone both in the same election.\n\nThe recount sets up what could be several days of political tension in this deeply divided state. President Donald Trump tweeted without evidence that the elections were being stolen. Protesters gathered at an elections office in Broward County, which is quickly becoming a battleground in the recount. The protesters waved signs, used bullhorns and even harangued a food delivery person at one point, asking if there were ballots inside the food bags.\n\nThe unofficial results show that Republican former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis led Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points in the election for governor.\n\nIn the Senate race, Republican Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s lead over Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson is 0.14 percentage points.\n\nFlorida Governor and Senate candidate Rick Scott says he is asking the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate elections offices in Palm Beach and Broward counties, questioning whether they were trying to inflate the Democratic vote. (Nov. 9)\n\nDetzner ordered machine recounts in both races. Once completed, if the differences in the races are at 0.25 percentage points or below, a hand recount will be ordered, said Department of State spokeswoman Sarah Revell.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Gillum withdrew his concession in the governor\u2019s race.\n\n\u201cLet me say clearly, I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call that we count every single vote,\u201d he said, adding that he would accept whatever outcome emerges.\n\nIn a video released Saturday afternoon, DeSantis thanked the state\u2019s supervisors of elections, canvassing boards, and the staffs for \u201cworking hard to ensure that all lawful votes are counted. He said he is preparing to become the state\u2019s next governor.\n\n\u201cIt is important that everyone involved in the election process strictly adhere to the rule of law which is the foundation for our nation,\u201d he said, adding that the election results were \u201cclear and unambiguous.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Scott implored the state\u2019s sheriffs to \u201cwatch for any violations and take appropriate action\u201d during the recount.\n\nScott and his supporters, including Trump, have alleged that voter fraud is underway in Democratic-leaning Broward County, where the Republican lead has narrowed since Election Day. There\u2019s no evidence of voter fraud and the state\u2019s election division, which Scott runs, said Saturday that its observers in Broward had seen \u201cno evidence of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement said Friday it has not launched any investigation into election fraud.\n\nFlorida\u2019s 67 counties will decide when to begin their recounts, but they must be completed by Thursday. Revell said Saturday that recounts can\u2019t begin until the county canvassing boards post a public meeting notice, hold that meeting and then do a public test of equipment.\n\nMiami-Dade County elections officials disclosed they had begun a machine recount Saturday evening. The process involved loading paper ballots into scanning machines and could take days, considering there were some 800,000 ballots cast.\n\nElections officials in two large counties in the Tampa Bay area \u2014 Pinellas and Hillsborough \u2014 said they would begin recounts Sunday morning.\n\nMachine recounts must be finished by 3 p.m. Thursday.\n\nThe Associated Press had called the governor\u2019s race for DeSantis. Following the recount announcement, the AP retracted its call. It is AP policy not to call a race that is facing a recount. No new call will be made until the recount is complete and the results of the election are certified by Florida officials.\n\nThe scene was reminiscent of the 2000 presidential recount, when it took more than five weeks for Florida to declare George W. Bush the victor over Vice President Al Gore by 537 votes, and thus giving Bush the presidency.\n\nFlorida was mocked for the way it handled the infamous 2000 recount, especially since there was no uniform process then on how to proceed. That has changed, with the Legislature passing a clear procedure on how a recount should be conducted.\n\nFlorida is also conducting a recount in a third statewide race. Democrat Nikki Fried had a 0.07 percentage point lead lead over Republican state Rep. Matt Caldwell in the race for agriculture commissioner, one of Florida\u2019s three Cabinet seats.\n\n___\n\nAP writer Kelli Kennedy in Fort Lauderdale and Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Columbus Blue Jackets\u2019 NHL-worst power play scored twice and Sergei Bobrovsky made 33 saves in a 2-1 victory over the Washington Capitals on Friday night.\n\nOliver Bjorkstrand scored in his return to the lineup and Anthony Duclair had his seventh goal of the season for Columbus, which has three power-play goals during its two-game winning streak.

(AP Photo/Jeff Martin)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 In a frantic search by phone and on foot, volunteers have been trying to find ballots that could help Democrat Stacey Abrams close the gap against Republican Brian Kemp in Georgia\u2019s unresolved race for governor.\n\nKemp leads in unofficial returns, and he already has resigned as secretary of state to start a transition with the blessing of the outgoing GOP governor, Nathan Deal. President Donald Trump tweeted Friday that Kemp \u201cran a great race in Georgia - he won. It is time to move on!\u201d\n\nYet Abrams, who hopes to become the nation\u2019s first black female governor, sent out volunteers and campaign staff in search of votes that she hopes could still tilt the margin toward her. The goal was to reach voters who used a provisional ballot to make sure they take steps to ensure their vote was counted by Friday evening, the deadline.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear whether the effort paid off, but a majority-black county with more than 750,000 residents in metro Atlanta, DeKalb, said it would remain open past normal hours for provisional voters who needed to provide identification so their votes could be counted.\n\nStacey Abrams' campaign says it will continue to fight to get all outstanding votes counted in the Georgia governor's race and won't accept former Secretary of State Brian Kemp's declaration of victory. (Nov. 8)\n\nThe story was different elsewhere. Two groups supporting Abrams\u2019 call to count all votes, ProGeorgia and Care in Action, said at least 12 other counties had certified election results before Friday, a move that could leave provisional ballots uncounted. The secretary of state\u2019s office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe New Georgia Project, which Abrams founded, had volunteers fanned out across the state looking for provisional ballot voters ahead of Friday\u2019s deadline. Besides knocking on hundreds of doors, the group was coordinating with black radio stations, flooding social media and texting hundreds of thousands of voters who might be wondering about provisional ballots.\n\nNse Ufot, executive director of the group, said the effort \u201cis not about the candidates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is about whether we\u2019re going to have a functioning democracy,\u201d said Ufot. \u201cOtherwise, people won\u2019t be reasonably assured that the will of Georgians is reflected in the results of the elections.\u201d\n\nAbrams\u2019 lawyers are exploring options to ensure all votes are counted. Her campaign leaders say they believe she needs to pick up about 25,000 votes to force a runoff.\n\nIn a warehouse-turned-phone bank near downtown, dozens of volunteers converged to make phone calls to voters who used a provisional ballot.\n\nHelen Brosnan of the National Domestic Workers Alliance stood on a chair and shouted, \u201cHow many calls do you think we can make? Can we make hundreds of calls? Let\u2019s do this!\u201d\n\nMarisa Franco, 27, saw a friend\u2019s Facebook post about the effort, then showed up at the warehouse to volunteer Friday morning.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s really central to democracy that everybody who is eligible to vote can vote and has the least amount of barriers possible, so I\u2019m just here to make sure that every vote counts,\u201d she said.\n\nReturns show Kemp with 50.3 percent of almost 4 million votes, a roughly 63,000-vote lead over Abrams. The difference is enough for an outright victory if total totals remain the same, but it\u2019s a narrow sum, considering the large turnout.\n\nThe Associated Press has not declared a winner in the race for Georgia governor. The AP will reassess the race Tuesday, the deadline for counties to certify election results to the state.\n\nWith legal wrangles opening and Abrams showing no signs of conceding, the dispute is prolonging a bitter contest with historical significance and national political repercussions.\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign manager, Lauren Groh-Wargo, said Kemp was to blame for problems because he was the secretary of state, Georgia\u2019s top election official, and tried to tamp down minority votes.\n\n\u201cThese suppressive tactics are reminiscent of the Old South, tactics that have been resurrected by Brian Kemp, who forced the state to allow him to oversee his own election, and had him be the decider on who was the winner,\u201d she said at a news conference.\n\nKemp contends he did his job properly and has argued that Abrams wants to help noncitizens vote illegally. Kemp, who has echoed Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric, cited a speech in which Abrams said \u201cundocumented\u201d people were part of her coalition.\n\nAbrams would become the first black woman elected governor of any U.S. state. Kemp seeks to maintain Republican dominance in a growing, diversifying Deep South state positioned to become a presidential battleground.\n\nThe key question is how many uncounted ballots actually remain.\n\nKemp said Thursday that it\u2019s fewer than 21,000 \u2014 almost certainly not enough to force a runoff. Abrams\u2019 campaign argues the total could be higher, and the secretary of state\u2019s office has shared scant details as officials in Georgia\u2019s 159 counties keep counting.\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign has reserved television advertising time and started sending vote-by-mail information to supporters in case she forces a Dec. 4 runoff with Kemp.\n\n___\n\nAP writer Errin Haines Whack contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "DEKALB, Ill.

Indiana has given up just 90 points and eight 3-pointers in its first two games while allowing opponents to shoot 28.7 percent from the field and forcing 45 turnovers.\n\nIt marked the first time since an 80-37 victory over Morehead State in December 1978 that any opponent failed to score at least 40 points on the Hoosiers\u2019 home court and only Notre Dame, which lost 94-29 in the first game ever played at Assembly Hall on Dec. 18, 1971, finished with fewer points.\n\nThe timing couldn\u2019t be better, either.\n\nAfter starting 2-0 for the 10th time in 11 seasons, the young Hoosiers have four days to prepare for their first serious test against Marquette, a team Miller called one of the best offensive teams in the country.\n\nIndiana is eager to see how it measures up.\n\n\u201cWe try to not play down to and we try not to play up the competition.

Alonso shot 7 for 12 from the field, including 5 for 9 on 3s, as he scored 20 points. But, it was Galloway, who led the Greensboro comeback. Galloway scored 25 of his 32 points after halftime.

(AP Photo/Butch Dill)\n\nSTARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) \u2014 Mississippi State has added a lot of talent around Quinndary Weatherspoon during his four seasons on the roster, so the Bulldogs don\u2019t need him to be the star every single night.\n\nBut in the first game of his senior year, the 6-foot-4 guard proved he\u2019s still more than capable of being the No. 1 option.\n\nWeatherspoon scored 21 points, younger brother Nick Weatherspoon added 19 and No. 18 Mississippi State beat Austin Peay 95-67 in the Bulldogs\u2019 season opener Friday night.\n\nThe older Weatherspoon was good the entire night, but especially during a stretch late in the first half when he scored seven straight points to push the Bulldogs to a 50-34 halftime lead.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m just trying to do everything I can to help my team get going, get a lead and play comfortable,\u201d he said.\n\nQuinndary Weatherspoon shot 10 of 15 from the field and grabbed five rebounds.

Mississippi State shot nearly 58 percent from the field despite going 7 of 25 (28 percent) from 3-point range.\n\n\u201cPutting up 95 points and only shooting 25, 28 percent from 3 shows that we can score the ball more than one way,\u201d Quinndary Weatherspoon said.\n\nAustin Peay was competitive for most of the night and pulled to 60-50 after a 3-pointer with 13:59 left. But the Bulldogs responded with an 11-3 run to put the game away.\n\nMississippi State (1-0) never trailed, jumping out to a 22-13 lead after nine minutes. The Bulldogs pulled ahead 50-34 by halftime thanks to 56 percent shooting from the field.

All five starters are back from last year\u2019s 14-19 squad that went 7-7 in conference play, but they need to be better out of the gate. The Ospreys went 0-6 to start last season with five of those games played on the road. North Florida will return home on Wednesday but will play their next four away from home.\n\nPenn State: It was a special night for the Nittany Lions who knocked off No. 13 West Virginia, a Sweet 16 team in the spring, with a last-second basket in a charity exhibition on Saturday. They unveiled their NIT championship banner and paid tribute to graduated veterans Julian Moore and Shep Garner. More importantly, they ushered in a handful of youngsters who looked good in their first games and will need to compliment the team\u2019s veterans if Penn State plans to make its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2011.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNorth Florida: The Ospreys host Edward Waters on Wednesday.\n\nPenn State: The Nittany Lions host Jacksonville State on Monday.", "Buffalo guard Davonta Jordan (4) drives up court while being defended by West Virginia guard James Bolden (3) during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game, Friday, Nov. 9, 2018, in Morgantown, W.Va.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Columbus Blue Jackets are finally starting to feel confident on the power play, and that could be dangerous for the rest of the NHL.\n\nColumbus\u2019 league-worst power play scored twice and Sergei Bobrovsky made 33 saves in a 2-1 victory over the defending Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals on Friday night.\n\nOliver Bjorkstrand scored in his return to the lineup and Anthony Duclair had his seventh goal of the season for the Blue Jackets, who have three power-play goals during their two-game winning streak.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working as a five-man unit,\u201d said Duclair, who scored from a sharp angle to tie Artemi Panarin for the team lead with seven goals. \u201cWe know the type of skill of talent we have on both units, and if we just put the work into it, I think they\u2019re going to start going in.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Jackets entered the night 7 of 59 on the power play, an 11.9 percent conversion rate that was last among the league\u2019s 31 teams. After his penalty kill went 4 for 5 against Washington, coach John Tortorella pointed out Columbus has kept its head above water with shaky special teams and could finally develop some consistency if those units round into form.\n\nBobrovsky is certainly there. The 2013 and 2017 Vezina Trophy winner was far more dialed in Friday than during the first round last spring against the Capitals when Columbus blew a 2-0 series lead.\n\nThe Russian goaltender who can be a free agent after the season was at his best early in making 15 first-period saves and then late on two third-period penalty kills that helped the Blue Jackets win in regulation and take over sole possession of first place in the Metropolitan Division.\n\n\u201cI felt pretty good again,\u201d said Bobrovsky, who faced 34 shots and never looked out of a play. \u201cI know that the Washington is a really good team, and if you relax too, too much they\u2019re going to score a goal right away. So, you have to respect them and compete against them. It\u2019s so much fun to beat them.\u201d\n\nCaptain Nick Foligno thought the Blue Jackets respected the Capitals too much, sitting back and leaning on Bobrovsky to win them the game. He allowed only a power-play goal to Matt Niskanen, who was wide open when he blasted home a shot from the point.\n\nWashington\u2019s Braden Holtby, who won the Vezina Trophy in 2016, was on top of his game in stopping 34 of the 36 shots he faced.

(Cloe Poisson/Hartford Courant via AP)\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 Jim Calhoun heard all the speculation that he would be a kinder, gentler coach at Division III University of Saint Joseph.\n\nHe is 76 years old, with health issues and no desire to offend the nuns at a small Catholic school that had only accepted women until this semester.\n\nBut a kinder, gentler Jim Calhoun?\n\n\u201cWrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we are in the battle, we are fighting all together.\u201d\n\nSix years after retiring from UConn, the Hall of Famer was in vintage form in his return to the sideline Friday night, knocking down chairs and confronting referees as his Blue Jays overcame a 13-point deficit in the second half to beat William Paterson 79-74 in the first men\u2019s college basketball game for St. Joe\u2019s.\n\nWith his team trailing 4-0 just 40 seconds into the game, Calhoun jumped from his seat, called his first timeout and loudly sent forward Mike Sagay to the bench. Sixteen minutes in, Calhoun picked up his first technical foul.\n\nDown 41-30 at halftime, he told the ESPN crew making a documentary about his return to coaching that it would not be able to air what he was about to say in the locker room.\n\n\u201cThese are my guys. This is my team,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, \u2018I take this stuff seriously.\u2019\u201d\n\nHis players responded, going on a 23-2 run and outscoring William Patterson 49-33 in the second half.\n\n\u201cThe way they came back was really special to me,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cSometimes you wonder why you coach the game. That\u2019s why I coach the game.\u201d\n\nCalhoun, who retired from UConn in 2012 with three national titles, has spent the last year building this program from scratch. He recruited the team (17 freshmen and three transfers), put together the schedule and has led fundraising for a new gym.\n\nThe current one holds about 350 people. The school played Friday\u2019s game at nearby Trinity College to accommodate the 1,800 fans who braved a pouring rain to see Calhoun\u2019s career record improve to 874-380.\n\nSt. Joe\u2019s has an undergraduate enrollment of just more than 900 students, with 94 freshmen men, many of whom learned about the school when it was announced that Calhoun would be in charge of the fledgling basketball program.\n\n\u201cThere is no question about it, the visibility that we got from having Jim Calhoun associated with the men\u2019s basketball program is priceless,\u201d school president Rhona Free said.\n\nCalhoun had worked over the past six years as an ESPN analyst and a consultant at UConn. But he said he has missed coaching and it didn\u2019t take much for him to say yes when he was asked to come to Saint Joseph by the school\u2019s athletic director, Bill Cardarelli, once an assistant under Calhoun at UConn.\n\n\u201cLook at him,\u201d Cardarelli said as the Blue Jays were making their second-half run. \u201cHe\u2019s so happy. You can see he\u2019s back where he belongs.\u201d\n\nCalhoun said his language Friday was a bit less salty. But he didn\u2019t spend much time sitting on the high-back stool he was given, even though he\u2019s acknowledged having a serious health problem, which he has declined to detail.\n\nBeing back coaching college kids, it appears, is just what the doctor ordered.\n\n\u201cWhen you see a group of people kind of bond together ... that\u2019s pretty special,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cIt\u2019s what I missed.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "FILE - In this Sept. 22, 2016, file photo, a man stands among the rubble of the Alsonidar Group's water pump and pipe factory after it was hit by Saudi-led airstrikes in Sanaa, Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said early Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, it had \"requested cessation of inflight refueling\" by the U.S. for its fighter jets after American officials said they would stop the operations amid growing anger over civilian casualties from the kingdom's airstrikes. (AP Photo/Hani Mohammed, File)\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said early Saturday it had \u201crequested cessation of inflight refueling\u201d by the U.S. for its fighter jets after American officials said they would stop the operations amid growing anger over civilian casualties from the kingdom\u2019s airstrikes.\n\nThe decision by the U.S. to pull out also comes amid outrage by U.S. lawmakers from both political parties over the Oct. 2 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe Saudi acknowledgement, and later U.S. comments, appeared aimed at suggesting the kingdom was behind the decision. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who launched the Yemen war as the kingdom\u2019s defense minister in March 2015, faces widespread international criticism for the war and after members of his entourage allegedly took part in Khashoggi\u2019s slaying.\n\n\u201cWe support the decision by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, after consultations with the U.S. government, to use the coalition\u2019s own military capabilities to conduct inflight refueling in support of its operations in Yemen,\u201d U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in a statement. \u201cThe U.S. will also continue working with the coalition and Yemen to minimize civilian casualties and expand urgent humanitarian efforts throughout the country.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear what impact the U.S. withdrawal from air refueling operations would have. American officials earlier said Saudi forces now handled some 80 percent of their refueling operations, which crucially allow aircraft to fly longer sorties over possible targets and can ease the pressure for quick strikes.\n\nYet even with that refueling support, Saudi Arabia has faced widespread international criticism over its campaign of airstrikes in the coalition\u2019s war in Yemen, targeting Shiite rebels known as Houthis who hold the capital, Sanaa.\n\nSaudi strikes have hit public markets, hospitals and other nonmilitary targets, killing scores of civilians. One such Saudi-led airstrike in August in Yemen\u2019s Saada province hit a bus and killed dozens of people, including schoolchildren wearing backpacks. Human rights groups have found fragments of American-made munitions after several of these strikes.\n\nU.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity Friday to discuss the decision before its announcement, said the end to refueling wouldn\u2019t stop American training and military assistance. The Post first reported the Trump administration\u2019s desire to end the refueling.\n\nThe Saudi statement, carried early Saturday on the state-run Saudi Press Agency, did not acknowledge the Trump administration\u2019s discussions and pressure for its withdrawal.\n\n\u201cRecently the kingdom and the coalition has increased its capability to independently conduct inflight refueling in Yemen,\u201d the statement read. \u201cAs a result, in consultation with the United States, the coalition has requested cessation of inflight refueling support for its operations in Yemen.\u201d\n\nIt also said it hoped upcoming United Nations sponsored talks \u201cin a third country\u201d would help end the war. U.N. special envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths has said he is consulting with Yemen\u2019s warring parties to finalize details for a new round of peace talks. However, Griffiths\u2019 effort to revive peace talks in September fell through after the Houthis failed to attend, arguing they didn\u2019t have guarantees for their safe return.\n\nNews of the halt to U.S. refueling operations was swiftly dismissed by the Houthis as a media ploy that came in response to international pressure on Washington and Riyadh over the Yemen war.\n\n\u201cWe have one clear demand and that is a complete halt to Saudi airstrikes,\u201d said one Houthi official who spoke to The Associated Press on Saturday on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media. \u201cIf there is a halt to the airstrikes, then we can proceed to political negotiations.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, intense fighting near the Red Sea port city of Hodeida continued over the weekend, with stepped up airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition pounding Houthi positions. On Saturday, the sound of large explosions east and north of Hodeida rocked the city as coalition forces tried to take the town of al-Saleh northeast of the city where they are meeting stiff resistance.\n\nThe Houthis maintain that their forces are holding their ground and deny losing territory to the coalition-led ground forces.\n\nThe pullout from refueling comes amid new American efforts to force an end to a conflict described as the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. Yemen, the Arab world\u2019s poorest country, has stood on the brink of famine and faced disease outbreaks in a conflict that has killed at least 10,000 people.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE view the war as a means to limit Iranian influence in the Arabian Peninsula. While Iran directly denies arming the rebels, the United Nations and Western powers have documented arms transfers to the Houthis by Tehran of everything from Kalashnikov assault rifles to the ballistic missile technology used to periodically target cities as far away as the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh. The Houthis also have imprisoned opponents and indiscriminately laid land mines.\n\nBoth Mattis and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have pushed for a cease-fire in recent days. Saudi and Emirati forces, as well as their allies on the ground, have made a renewed push for the Houthi-held Red Sea port city of Hodeida, through which most food and aid enters Yemen. International aid agencies warn any disruption to the port could sever that crucial lifeline.\n\n\u201cHodeida is at risk of being obliterated,\u201d said Mohamed Abdi of the Norwegian Refugee Council. \u201cWe are now warning that by allowing this to go on, parties to the conflict and their international backers will be responsible for the death, injury and suffering of millions of people.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Lolita Baldor and Matthew Lee in Washington and Ahmed al-Haj in Sanaa, Yemen contributed to this report.", "Orlando Magic's Jonathon Simmons, right, loses control of the ball as he goes to the basket against Washington Wizards' John Wall (2) during the second half of an NBA basketball game, Friday, Nov. 9, 2018, in Orlando, Fla.

Bouldin gave Chattanooga an offensive spark by banking in a hook shot and making a 3-pointer from the corner to give the Mocs an 11-7 lead.\n\nFueled by turnovers and Durr\u2019s scoring, Louisville went on a a run to end the half. The senior guard hit a 3-pointer and finished a layup on the break to give the Cardinals a 28-20 lead.\n\nLouisville came out of the halftime break with renewed energy on defense and quickly built their lead. The Cardinals started the third quarter on an 8-0 run, and never looked back. Durr made back-to-back 3s to give Louisville a 51-27 lead, and capped the third quarter with a 40-foot shot at the buzzer.\n\n\u201cWe just really talked about pushing the tempo and trying to create as many scoring opportunities as we could and I thought we did a really nice job of that,\u201d Walz said of the third-quarter run. \u201cWe ran the floor and got two layups from our post players right out of the gate, which kind of opened things up for everybody else.\u201d\n\nAfter busing home for a short break, Louisville travels to play at Boise State on Nov. 19 before heading straight to Las Vegas for games against No. 23 Arizona State and Hartford at the Southpoint Shootout.\n\nDurr is glad to have been pushed by the Mocs early to help prepare for the future.\n\n\u201cChattanooga made some great plays. They had some great players and went on some great runs. They made us work,\u201d Durr said. \u201cWe will go back and watch this film to see what we can take from it and become better.\u201d\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nLouisville: The Cardinals need to find ways to score in the half-court when Durr isn\u2019t. Louisville struggled to generate points in the first half while Durr was contained by Chattanooga\u2019s defense or sitting on the bench. Louisville\u2019s pressure defense helped alleviate the problem in the second half by getting points in transition.\n\nChattanooga: In their first big test under new coach Katie Burrows, the Mocs weren\u2019t afraid and hung with Louisville through the first half. But Louisville\u2019s pressure finally wore Chattanooga down. The experience will serve the Mocs well the remainder of the season against less-heralded opponents.\n\nKEY STATS\n\nChattanooga outshot Louisville 52-51, but Louisville made 28 field goals, including eight 3-pointers. Chattanooga hung with Louisville on the boards, getting outrebounded only 35-29.\n\nCLOSER TO HOME\n\nThe trip to Chattanooga was a bit of a homecoming for Louisville assistant coach Sam Purcell.

He\u2019s the most cerebral player on our team,\u201d Prohm said. \u201cHe\u2019s a senior point guard and he played like it.\u201d\n\nIowa State closed the first half on a 9-0 run and pushed its lead to 47-30 early in the second half. Missouri cut it to 10, but the undermanned Cyclones reeled off eight straight points to jump back on top 61-43. Weiler-Babb\u2019s scoop with 4:52 to go made it 70-49, a bucket that put the Tigers out of their misery.\n\nMark Smith scored 15 points to lead Missouri (1-1), which committed 25 turnovers. Kevin Puryear had 10 points, but he only took five shots.\n\n\u201cAt one point, it seemed like it was one after another. We need to have better focus at protecting the ball,\u201d Puryear said.\n\nWigginton, a preseason All-Big 12 selection, showed up to Friday\u2019s game against Missouri with a cast on his left foot that was put on Thursday.\n\nProhm called the injury a strain, adding that Wigginton will spend a week in a cast, a week in a boot and then, hopefully, go through and aggressive rehabilitation to try and get back onto the floor as soon as possible.\n\nWigginton averaged 16.7 points a game last season and nearly declared for the NBA Draft before returning to school. Wigginton had 13 points in Iowa State\u2019s 79-53 win over Alabama State on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a timeframe,\u201d Prohm said. \u201cTo get him back the quickest, we needed to immobilize his foot right away.\u201d\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMissouri: The Tigers had a staggering 15 turnovers in the first half \u2014 four more than they had in a 68-55 win over Central Arkansas in the opener \u2014 and committed 26 fouls. This loss might\u2019ve been the truest sign yet of how much Missouri is going to miss the injured Jontay Porter this season.\n\nIowa State: With Wigginton out and Cameron Lard and Zoran Talley suspended until at least December, Iowa State\u2019s eight-man rotation currently has four true freshmen in it. It was a highly thought of class, to be sure, but being forced to play them all so soon certainly wasn\u2019t in coach Steve Prohm\u2019s master plan.\n\nON HALIBURTON\n\nHaliburton, at 6-foot-5 and just 172 pounds, might be one of the skinniest players in America \u2014 and the release on his jumper is, shall we say, funky. But the kid plays like he\u2019s been in Ames for years, rounding his teammates up on stoppages of play like a senior and displaying a well-rounded skill set through two games. Haliburton had eight points, four steals and three rebounds in 40 minutes, and he didn\u2019t turn the ball over once. \u201cTyrese just has that kind of \u2018It\u2019 factor,\u201d Prohm said.\n\nMIZZ-ERABLE\n\nMissouri outrebounded the smaller Cyclones 35-26.

Kentucky won 71-59. (AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley)\n\nLEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Those lopsided wins No. 2 Kentucky is normally used to this time of year might eventually happen. All that mattered to the Wildcats was proving they could regroup from a blowout loss and get their first victory.\n\nIt certainly took everything for them to scrape past Southern Illinois.\n\nKeldon Johnson and Immanuel Quickley each scored 15 points, Nick Richards grabbed a career-high 19 rebounds and the Wildcats rallied in the second half to beat the Salukis 71-59 on Friday night.\n\nKentucky (1-1) managed to bounce back from Tuesday night\u2019s 118-84 shellacking by No. 4 Duke, its most lopsided loss under coach John Calipari. It left the Wildcats a lot of room for improvement, but the biggest question was whether they could shake the disappointment of being pounded by the Blue Devils on a national stage.\n\nThe Wildcats did, but they had to work hard in the second half to overcome sloppy play and the veteran Salukis, who led 44-37 before Quickley and Quade Green (14 points) made consecutive 3-pointers to spark a 10-2 run for a 47-46 lead with 12:19 left.\n\n\u201cOur energy and effort was off the charts,\u201d Quickley said. \u201cThis team\u2019s really good with that. We just have to keep getting better every day, individually and as a team.\u201d\n\nSIU didn\u2019t quit, but the Wildcats slowly extended their lead to 61-52 on consecutive three-point plays by Johnson and Green. Kentucky went on to win, and Calipari saw the effort as progress no matter how it looked.\n\n\u201cI just said, be happy we won and figure it out,\u201d said the coach, who has won all 10 home openers with Kentucky. \u201cI\u2019ve got a pretty good idea of how I\u2019m going to do this now, and I\u2019m just glad that we really got smashed, so there\u2019s no question.\n\n\u201cIf you demand a lot, you get a lot. If you accept mediocrity, you\u2019re going to get it every time. ... I was very aggressive today.\u201d\n\nSo was Richards, whose rebounding provided the biggest lift as Kentucky dominated SIU 48-19 on the glass. The sophomore forward had as many boards as the Salukis combined, surpassing his previous best of 15 last season against Fort Wayne. His total matched the highest by a Kentucky player since Michael Kidd-Gilchrist grabbed 19 against Louisville in December 2011.\n\n\u201cMy team just needed to get rebounds with Reid (Travis) out of the game,\u201d said Richards, who also had three blocks. \u201cJust playing my game and guys were just playing better, just trying to play harder as team to get the \u2018W.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Wildcats also shot 47 percent after halftime and limited SIU to 1 of 7 shooting from long range.\n\nAaron Cook had 18 points and Kavion Pippen 16 for the Salukis (0-1), who opened against their first ranked team since No. 13 Illinois in 2010. They shot 41 percent in their first meeting with the Wildcats.\n\nPATIENCE, PLEASE\n\nSIU coach Barry Hinson credited the Rupp Arena crowd of 20,277 for motivating Kentucky to rally past his squad. He also urged Big Blue Nation to use restraint when judging the perennially-young Wildcats.\n\n\u201cYou want to microwave the maturation process and you can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes time. So, back off and let these guys go through the maturation process and let coach Calipari do what he does best. By March, you\u2019re going to have something on the floor you\u2019re going to be really proud of.\u201d\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nKentucky should remain in the Top 10 after a bounce-back win, even if it was a little shaky at times.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nSouthern Illinois: The Salukis returned five starters from last year\u2019s 20-13 team and played as if they had been together for a while, pushing the offensive tempo and forcing the Wildcats into mistakes most of the night. But they let their seven-point edge slip away because they missed shots and couldn\u2019t keep Kentucky off the glass, especially Richards.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between losing and getting beat,\u201d Hinson said. \u201cTonight, we got beat. Losing is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nKentucky: Developing chemistry might take a while for the Wildcats, who seemed out of sync for many stretches and committed 19 turnovers. They were fortunate that Richards was fierce on the glass while Green and EJ Montgomery (10 points) contributed critical scoring as Kentucky dominated bench scoring 32-6.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSouthern Illinois hosts Buffalo on Monday in the first of a home-and-home series this season with the Bulls.

(AP) \u2014 Even Stanford coach Jerod Haase knows that the Cardinal\u2019s early season schedule might be a bit much.\n\nSophomore KZ Okpala had 23 points and Stanford scored 17 unanswered first-half points to take control and beat UNC Wilmington 72-59 on Friday night, the first of two games in North Carolina amid a November full of cross-country flights.\n\nCormac Ryan added 14 for the Cardinal (2-0), who traveled about 2,500 miles to become the first power-conference team to visit the Seahawks in nearly a decade. After traveling to No. 8 North Carolina to return a game after the Tar Heels visited them last year, the Cardinal will come home for one game, then head back east for the three-games-in-three-days Battle 4 Atlantis tournament in the Bahamas during the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about frequent-flier miles,\u201d Haase quipped to The Associated Press afterward.\n\nStanford trailed by eight midway through the first half but held the Seahawks (0-2) without a basket for the final 7\u00bd minutes before halftime to take a 39-25 lead at the break. Stanford quickly pushed that margin to 18, and UNCW got no closer than eight again.\n\nDevontae Cacok and Jeantal Cylla each scored 14 for the Seahawks (0-2), who were hosting a power-conference opponent for the first time since losing to Wake Forest from the Atlantic Coast Conference in December 2009. There was a connection that helped get this one scheduled: the teams are coached by former Kansas teammates and North Carolina assistant coaches under Roy Williams in Haase and UNCW\u2019s C.B. McGrath.\n\nUNCW, from the Colonial Athletic Association, is slated to return the visit next season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m appreciative of him coming on the road,\u201d McGrath said. \u201cNot too many coaches at a (power-conference) school would do that. I really appreciate him bringing his team, letting the fans see what Stanford looks like, a Pac-12 school.\u201d\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nStanford: The November miles will add up quickly. Haase will certainly learn a bit about his team\u2019s maturity in handling this opening stretch, as well as a nonconference schedule that includes a visit to top-ranked Kansas on Dec. 1.\n\n\u201cI want to be part of the Atlantis tournament because it\u2019s a special deal,\u201d Haase said. \u201cI want to go back and play at Kansas because it\u2019s a special deal.

They beat Wofford 78-67 on Tuesday night in Spartanburg, South Carolina, before having a much easier time against the Phoenix, who christened their new $40 million on-campus arena.\n\nThe point total matched UNC\u2019s highest in 16 seasons under Roy Williams and was the program\u2019s most in a decade. North Carolina also scored 116 against UNC Asheville in 2008.\n\n\u201cIt was a nice night for us,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt was a nice night, I hope, for Elon, except for the score.\u201d\n\nLittle was 9 of 13 while Johnson finished 7 of 11.

But the exact number remains unclear with a handful of races still too close to call.\n\nIn the Senate, party officials were watching several races Friday, including one involving Joe Fain of Auburn, a member of Senate Republican Leadership running for re-election under the cloud of a rape allegation he denies.\n\nFain conceded the race Friday evening in a Facebook post when the latest returns showed Democratic challenger Mona Das had extended her lead to 548 votes.\n\n\u201cI want to congratulate Senator-Elect Das on her new opportunity to serve South King County in the Washington State Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to supporting her during the transition in any way I can.\u201d\n\nIn September, Seattle resident Candace Faber tweeted that Fain raped her in 2007 in Washington, D.C. Faber said she was inspired to speak publicly as she watched the televised hearing on allegations against U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nFain wasn\u2019t in office at the time of the alleged assault.\n\nA state Senate committee on Thursday approved an outside investigation into the rape allegation. Senate leaders said then that they may re-evaluate their decision if Fain loses his election. It wasn\u2019t immediately known if Senate leaders would reconsider.\n\nIn another seat Democrats are hoping to flip, Republican Sen. Mark Miloscia of Federal Way trailed Friday by more than 3,500 votes Friday to challenger Claire Wilson in the 30th District.\n\nTwo other Senate contests, one for a seat in the 26th District vacated by Republican Sen. Jan Angell of Port Angeles and one for Ferndale Republican Sen. Doug Ericksen\u2019s seat, were too close to call Friday.\n\nRepublican Marty McClendon was up by 222 votes over Democrat Emily Randall, while Ericksen led Pinky Vargas by only 72 votes, which could mean a recount for that race.\n\n\u201cWe saw that we could win in districts where Hillary (Clinton) won, and we feel good if we end up with three seats,\u201d Alex Bond, political director of the Washington Senate Democratic Campaign said Friday. \u201cI think that\u2019s a strong result that we\u2019re proud of.\u201d\n\nWhile Democrats hold most statewide offices in Washington, the political split in the Legislature has been much narrower.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Matthew G. Whitaker, the nation\u2019s new acting attorney general, repeatedly chided presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in public statements during 2016 while he was speaking for a group that is barred by its tax-exempt status from supporting or opposing political candidates during a campaign.\n\nBefore coming to the Justice Department in 2017, Whitaker was president and executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a charitable organization that styles itself as nonpartisan government watchdog promoting ethics and transparency. The tax-exempt group \u2014 known by its initials, FACT \u2014 is supposed to serve the public interest under Section 501c3 of the U.S. tax code, without directly or even indirectly supporting or opposing specific candidates for office.\n\nYet the group has engaged in one partisan pronouncement after another, mostly directed at Democrats. During the last presidential race, Whitaker argued in July 2016 newspaper opinion pieces that Clinton should be prosecuted for her handling of her private email server \u2014 a favorite talking point of Donald Trump. The opinion pieces identified Whitaker as FACT\u2019s leader.\n\nIn September 2016, Whitaker argued that Clinton had acted shamelessly by appointing her charity\u2019s donors to boards of the State Department when she was secretary of state.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody in the history of our country that served in the administration has been this bold in their private fundraising and their sort of giving favors,\u201d he said in a radio interview posted on YouTube by his group.\n\nDaniel Borochoff, president of CharityWatch, a Chicago-based group that monitors the nonprofit world, said that statement appears to violate the IRS ban on engagement for or against a particular political candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s highly critical of a candidate, and he ought not to be doing that, because it\u2019s a political partisan comment,\u201d he said.\n\nWhitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, left FACT in October 2017 to become Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 chief of staff. He was named this week by President Trump to take over at least temporarily for Sessions, who resigned at Trump\u2019s request.\n\nFACT was founded in 2015, tax filings show. Whitaker drew a sizable portion of its budget as his salary as president and executive director \u2014 in 2016 he earned more than twice what leaders of similar groups were paid on average that year, according to data from another watchdog group, Charity Navigator.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Whitaker earned a total of $654,000 from FACT \u2014 30 percent of its entire spending of $2.2 million over that two-year span. His 2016 salary was $402,000; the average CEO or executive director at 380 advocacy or education charities in that year made a salary of $173,099, according to Matthew J. Viola, a vice president at Charity Navigator.\n\nBorochoff suggested that Whitaker\u2019s board of directors at FACT didn\u2019t appear to be independent enough to apply the brakes on his campaign partisanship. Whitaker appeared to exert tight control over a three-person board of directors that included just one unsalaried member, according to the group\u2019s IRS filings in 2015-16.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s foundation was initially formed and then primarily supported with funds from another organization called Donor\u2019s Trust. That group is a nonprofit built to give conservative and libertarian philanthropists \u201cany level of privacy they want,\u201d according to its marketing materials.\n\nA FACT spokesman declined to provide any details on donors or any on-the-record response to other questions. There was no immediate reply to a request for comment from Whitaker made through the Justice Department.\n\nThough 501c3 groups can legally withhold the identity of their contributors and generally do so, there may be a distinct irony when a group dedicated to transparency keeps its funding sources in the shadows.\n\nIn 2014, FACT\u2019s only source of funds was Donor\u2019s Trust, according to IRS filings. In 2015, funds from Donor\u2019s Trust accounted for all but $191 of FACT\u2019s $500,191 in revenue. In 2016, Donor\u2019s Trust provided $800,000 of FACT\u2019s revenues of $1,350,265.\n\nIt is clear from IRS filings that FACT has paid outside Republican firms to perform some of its work. One such firm is America Rising LLC, which was given $144,000 for research in 2015.\n\nAmerica Rising LLC formed in Delaware in 2002 and was first registered to do business in Virginia in 2016, but its registration was canceled in May 2018 for failing to pay its annual registration fee, according to Katha Treanor, a spokeswoman for the State Corporation Commission. America Rising LLC did not respond to queries from The Associated Press.\n\n__\n\nAP writer Jeff Horwitz reported from Washington.", "1 of 6 Providence guard A.J.

Two days earlier, she led by about 6,000 votes.\n\nAnd in the Central Valley\u2019s 10th District, Democrat Josh Harder grabbed a nearly 2-point lead after trailing Rep.

Republican Young Kim held about a 2,600-vote edge over Democrat Gil Cisneros, or 2 points, with about 164,000 votes counted. If elected, Kim would become the first Korean-American immigrant woman elected to the House. At midweek, she had a 3-point edge.\n\nTens of thousands of provisional and late-arriving mail-in ballots remain to be counted in each district.\n\nLike Royce, Rohrabacher and Walters represent districts in Orange County, a one-time Republican stronghold where Democrats are attempting to capture as many as four GOP-held districts. They already have won one \u2014 retiring U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa\u2019s seat went to Mike Levin, a former Orange County Democratic Party official.\n\nAnd Democrats also have picked up the last Republican-held House seat anchored in Los Angeles County. First-time candidate Katie Hill, 31, ousted Republican Steve Knight, who was seeking a third term in the 25th District in northern Los Angeles County and a slice of Ventura County.\n\nHill\u2019s victory gave Democrats a 40-13 advantage in California\u2019s congressional delegation.\n\nThe Republican-turned-Democrat Rouda has depicted Rohrabacher as the face of gridlock on Capitol Hill.

The new Parliament is to be convened on Jan. 17.\n\nSri Lanka has been in a political crisis since Oct. 26, when Sirisena fired his prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and replaced him with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa.\n\nWickremesinghe has insisted his firing is unconstitutional. He has refused to vacate his official residence and demanded that Parliament be summoned immediately to prove he had support among its members.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge Wickremesinghe repeatedly denied.\n\nSirisena was also critical of investigations into military personnel accused of human rights violations during Sri Lanka\u2019s long civil war against a Tamil separatist group, which ended in 2009.\n\nSirisena had suspended Parliament for two weeks in a move Wickremesinghe\u2019s backers said was designed to buy time to shore up support. There were calls both locally and internationally to convene Parliament to end the impasse.\n\nAmid the pressure, Sirisena announced the legislature would be summoned Nov. 14. He maintained his choice for prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, had a majority in Parliament. However, the decision to dissolve the house shows otherwise, observers say.\n\n\u201cThe dissolution clearly indicates that Mr. Sirisena has grossly misjudged and miscalculated the support that he might or could secure to demonstrate support in the Parliament,\u201d said Bharath Gopalaswamy, director at U.S.-based analyst group Atlantic Council\u2019s South Asia Center.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, he is a victim of his own homegrown crisis.\u201d\n\nWickremesinghe\u2019s camp is likely to contest Sirisena\u2019s move because of constitutional provisions stating a Parliament can\u2019t be dissolved until 4 \u00bd years after its election. The current Parliament was elected in August 2015.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally unconstitutional,\u201d said Harsha de Silva, a member of Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Party and a former minister. \u201cSirisena has relegated the constitution to toilet paper. We will fight this dictator to the end.\u201d\n\nThe party said in a Twitter message that it will meet the elections commissioner to discuss the constitutionality of Sirisena\u2019s move.\n\nThe U.S State Department tweeted that it is deeply concerned by news the Sri Lanka Parliament will be dissolved, \u201cfurther deepening the political crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a committed partner of Sri Lanka, we believe democratic institutions and processes need to be respected to ensure stability and prosperity,\u201d the statement said.\n\nEarlier, U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel, the top-ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and two other lawmakers wrote to Sirisena warning that actions circumventing the democratic process could impact U.S. assistance \u2014 including a planned five-year aid package from the Millennium Challenge Corporation worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\u201cWe fear that recent actions, if not corrected, will threaten your country\u2019s democratic development and derail the progress made in recent years,\u201d the three lawmakers said in a letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nRajapaksa indicated what was coming hours before the dissolution in a speech. He said the government must go to the people for confirmation on whether the president made the correct decision when he appointed him as prime minister.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Emily Schmall in New Delhi, India, and Matthew Pennington in Washington contributed to this report.", "Fire officials: More than 150 homes destroyed in Southern California wildfires; 250,000 under evacuation orders", "", "Click to copy\n\nClick to copy https://apnews.com/39f05db1b5614baca4c3656f3bdce423", "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Prince Turki Al-Faisal, Saudi Arabia\u2019s former spy chief, said Friday the country is proud of its judicial system and will never accept an international investigation into the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, human rights groups, and some government leaders have called for an independent probe into the Oct. 2 killing of the Washington Post columnist at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul where he had gone to get papers so he could marry his Turkish fiance. The United States called Monday for a \u201cthorough, conclusive and transparent\u201d investigation at the Geneva-based Human Rights Council.\n\nTurki said in a speech and question-and-answer session at the International Peace Institute think tank that he expects the kingdom to live up to its promise to investigate and \u201cput all of the facts on the table\u201d and answer all outstanding questions, including what happened to Khashoggi\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cThe kingdom is not going to accept an international tribunal to look into something that is Saudi, and the Saudi judicial system is sound, it is up, it is running, and it will take its course,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kingdom ... will never accept foreign interference in that system.\u201d\n\nIn doing this, Turki said, Saudi Arabia is following other countries that have refused to allow international tribunals to investigate acts that happened on their soil or elsewhere by their citizens. He cited the abuse of prisoners by American troops and CIA staff at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq following the 2003 U.S. invasion which the United States investigated.\n\nTurki said Khashoggi was the Saudi embassy spokesman when he was ambassador to the United States and Britain, and they had been \u201cvery friendly over the years.\u201d He described Khashoggi\u2019s death, citing a verse from the Quran. \u201cIt says that the killing of an innocent man is like the killing of all of humanity. His death falls into that category,\u201d Turki said.\n\nSaudi Arabia had insisted for weeks after Khashoggi disappeared that he had walked out of the consulate, before changing its account to say he died in a brawl. Last month, Saudi Arabia acknowledged that Turkish evidence indicates that Khashoggi\u2019s killing was premeditated, shifting its explanation in an apparent effort to ease international outrage over the death.\n\nTurkey says Khashoggi, who was critical of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was strangled and dismembered at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 by a 15-member assassination squad. Media reports have suggested that his body could have been chemically dissolved.\n\nSaudi officials characterize the killing as a rogue operation carried out by Saudi agents who exceeded their authority. Yet some of those implicated in the killing are close to the crown prince, including a member of the prince\u2019s entourage on foreign trips who was seen at the consulate before Khashoggi\u2019s slaying. And crown prince Mohammed\u2019s condemnation of the killing has failed to ease suspicions that he was involved.\n\nTurkey is seeking the extradition of 18 suspects who have been detained in Saudi Arabia, so they can be put on trial in Turkey. They include the 15 members of the alleged \u201chit squad.\u201d\n\nPrince Turki, who is chairman of the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, said his view is that there was no attempted cover up.\n\nRather, he said, what was reported to Saudi authorities was \u201cmisleading\u201d because \u201cthose who perpetrated the crime wanted to hide what had happened and to justify what they had told the authorities.\u201d\n\nHe accused the media of seeking \u201csensation\u201d and of \u201claying accusations\u201d about the crown prince \u201cwithout a fact,\u201d and based on \u201cpure speculation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is you can never hide the truth \u2014 and the kingdom will never attempt to hide the truth, not just on this situation but on other situations,\u201d he said.\n\nHe reiterated that the final report \u201cwill lay out exactly what happened and answer all of these questions that have been speculated about and made into tremendous issues.\u201d", "", "", "", "AVONDALE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 The cheating scandal that knocked Kevin Harvick out of NASCAR\u2019s championship round didn\u2019t slow him a bit at one of his favorite race tracks.\n\nHarvick won the pole for Sunday\u2019s final qualifying race for the championship finale with a strong run that briefly overshadowed the controversy his Stewart-Haas Racing team created with an illegal part.\n\nHarvick turned a lap at 139.340 mph Friday around ISM Raceway outside Phoenix to put himself in position to requalify for the championship. His winning car from last week was found to have an illegal spoiler and the punishment cost him his automatic berth into the final four.\n\nNeeding a trouble-free run at ISM Raceway outside Phoenix to get back into the finale, Harvick put his No. 4 Ford in the top starting spot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more about people than it is about cars and we\u2019ve got a lot of good people,\u201d Harvick said. \u201cYou can\u2019t drive a slow car fast and you can\u2019t beat good people.\u201d\n\nHarvick is working this weekend with an interim crew chief and car chief because his have been suspended for the final two races of the season.

He also won at Phoenix in 2014 when a victory was the only thing that would qualify him for the Homestead-Miami Speedway finale, where he captured his only Cup championship.\n\nAs for what happened with his car at Texas last week, or Childers\u2019 explanation earlier Friday in that the manufactured spoiler was done because the team saw other teams were manipulating the part, Harvick had nothing to offer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t build the cars. I couldn\u2019t tell you what\u2019s on the car. What\u2019s good, what\u2019s bad,\u201d Harvick said. \u201cThat\u2019s their job and I drive it. I show up and do the best that I can and obviously you\u2019ve seen the statements and the things from Stewart-Haas Racing and the best thing that shows up are results on the race track. I drive and try to do the best that I can and we go from there.\u201d\n\nChase Elliott, a playoff contender, qualified second and was followed by Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Ryan Blaney and Alex Bowman, none of who are racing for the three remaining spots in the finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Only Joey Logano is already locked into Homestead and he qualified ninth.\n\nThe rest of the playoff drivers are spread throughout the field. Kyle Busch qualified sixth, reigning series champion Martin Truex Jr. was 13th and followed by Kurt Busch.

A knife-wielding man stabbed two people, one fatally, in Australia's second-largest city on Friday in an attack likely linked to terrorism, police said. The attack during the afternoon rush hour brought central Melbourne to a standstill.(James Ross/AAP Image via AP)\n\nSYDNEY (AP) \u2014 Australia police said Saturday a man who fatally stabbed another and injured two in what they described as an Islamic State-inspired terrorist attack in central Melbourne had also planned to set off an explosion.\n\nThe attacker, Hassain Khalif Shire Ali, 30, had his passport canceled in 2015 after it was learned he planned to travel to Syria, police said.\n\nThe attack occurred on Friday when Shire Ali got out of a pickup vehicle, which he then set on fire, and stabbed three men, one of whom died at the scene. The attack horrified hundreds of onlookers during the afternoon rush hour in Australia\u2019s second-biggest city.\n\nVictoria state Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said Shire Ali, who was shot by police and died in a hospital, had also made an \u201cunsophisticated\u201d plan for his vehicle to explode to cause many more fatalities. He had placed several barbecue gas canisters in the back of his pickup, with the outlet valves open, but they had failed to ignite.\n\n\u201cIt looks like he\u2019s attempted to ignite a fire in the car, we believe at this stage with a view to igniting those canisters with some sort of explosion, but that didn\u2019t eventuate,\u201d Ashton told reporters.\n\nShire Ali, who moved to Australia with his family from Somalia in the 1990s, was known to police and the federal intelligence authority ASIO. He had a criminal history for cannabis use, theft and driving offences, Ashton said.\n\nAustralian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Ian McCartney told a media briefing on Saturday it was believed the attack was inspired by IS, though it was thought Shire Ali had no direct links to the organization.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say he was inspired. He was radicalized, with the rise of the caliphate and the propaganda that was put out on the internet. We\u2019re not saying there was direct contact. We\u2019re saying it was more from an inspirational perspective,\u201d McCartney said.\n\nMcCartney said the incident was a \u201creality check\u201d for security agencies that \u201ceven with the fall of the (IS) caliphate ... the threat continues to be real.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said \u201cradical, violent, extremist Islam\u201d poses the greatest threat to Australia\u2019s national security.\n\n\u201cHere in Australia, we would be kidding ourselves if we did not call out the fact that the greatest threat of religious extremism in this country is the radical and dangerous ideology of extremist Islam,\u201d he said.\n\nMorrison said he had long-standing relationships with the Muslim community and it was them who had raised with him concerns about radicalism in recent years.\n\nShire Ali had family and associates who were also known to police. His brother Ali Khalif Shire Ali is currently on remand awaiting trial next year for allegedly planning an attack, Ashton said.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for Friday\u2019s attack but provided no evidence. It said the man was an Islamic State fighter and had responded to IS calls for attacks in countries that are part of the international coalition fighting the militants in Syria and Iraq.\n\nPolice and civilians had tried unsuccessfully to subdue Shire Ali before he was shot in the chest by a police officer, who Ashton said only graduated from the police academy three months ago.\n\nA man aged 74, who had been stabbed in the face, died at the scene. Two other men, aged 26 and 58, are in a hospital with what police describe as non-life threatening injuries.\n\nAshton also said police had searched two Melbourne properties on Saturday in relation to the attack, but that police did not believe there were any ongoing threats to the public.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time in four years Australia has witnessed militant violence.\n\nIn December 2014, a 17-hour siege in which a gunman took 18 people hostage in a Sydney cafe ended with two hostages dead and the assailant killed by police. Though the erratic gunman demanded that police deliver him an Islamic State flag at the outset of the crisis, there was no evidence he had established contact with the militant group. However, at a later inquest, the coroner of New South Wales state said the gunman\u2019s actions fell \u201cwithin the accepted definition of terrorism.\u201d\n\nMelbourne was also the scene of two fatal car-ramming incidents last year, but neither was linked by police to terrorism.\n\nAshton says there is no suggestion Shire Ali was inspired by James \u201cDimitrious\u201d Gargasoulas, who faced court this week on six charges of murder over the first ramming attack, in January 2017.", "Former worker sentenced in sex assault of juvenile inmate\n\nCASPER, Wyo.
