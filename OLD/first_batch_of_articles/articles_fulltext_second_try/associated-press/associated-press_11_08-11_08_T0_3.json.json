The orders allow authorities to seize assets from people suspected of corruption or links to organized crime until the owners account for how they were acquired.\n\nAt a court hearing this year, a lawyer for the National Crime Agency gave details of Hajiyeva\u2019s spending at Harrods, including 100,000 pounds in one day on Cartier jewelry, 150,000 pounds in another trip on goods from luxury brand Boucheron, and 1,800 pounds on wine.\n\nLast week the agency, which investigates cross-border and organized crime, seized 49 items of jewelry worth 400,000 pounds from Christie\u2019s auction house, where Hajiyeva\u2019s daughter had taken them to be valued.\n\nThe items included a Boucheron sapphire and ruby necklace worth up to 120,000 pounds and a Van Cleef & Arpels pearl necklace worth 20,000 pounds, which investigators say was originally bought by Hajiyeva\u2019s husband in St. Moritz, Switzerland, for more than 10 times that amount.\n\nHajiyeva denies wrongdoing and is fighting to overturn the order and hang on to her assets.\n\nHer lawyers have said the wealth order \u201cis part of an investigative process, not a criminal procedure, and it does not involve the finding of any criminal offense.\u201d\n\nBritish police arrested Hajiyeva for alleged embezzlement last week at the request of Azerbaijan.\n\nBen Keith, a lawyer for Azerbaijan\u2019s government, said during a British High Court hearing Thursday that Hajiyeva faced allegations of \u201cembezzling money from the International Bank of Azerbaijan.\u201d\n\nHe said there were \u201csubstantial grounds to believe she would not surrender\u201d to the court if she was granted bail.\n\nBut judge Jeremy Baker ruled there were no \u201csubstantial grounds\u201d to refuse bail.", "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

Frankenstein witnessed as the orphanage was attack by a Nazis during the terror night of Nov. 9, 1938. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\n\nBERLIN (AP) \u2014 Walter Frankenstein was 14 years old when a police officer came to the Jewish orphanage he was living at in Berlin, urging all children to leave the building immediately because \u201csomething bad will happen tonight.\u201d\n\nIt was early evening, November 9, 1938. Later that night, he climbed up on the roof of the orphanage and saw fire lighting up the city.\n\n\u201cThen we knew: the synagogues were burning,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next morning, when I had to go to school, there was sparkling, broken glass everywhere on the streets.\u201d\n\nFrankenstein, now 94, was describing Kristallnacht \u2014 the \u201cNight of Broken Glass\u201d \u2014 when Nazis, among them many ordinary Germans, terrorized Jews throughout Germany and Austria. They killed at least 91 people and vandalized 7,500 Jewish businesses. They also burned more than 1,400 synagogues, according to Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.\n\nUp to 30,000 Jewish men were arrested, many taken to concentration camps such as Dachau or Buchenwald. Hundreds more committed suicide or died as a result of the mistreatment in the camps years before the official mass deportations began.\n\nAs Germany marked the 80th anniversary of the anti-Jewish pogroms this week with a series of memorial events, Frankenstein returned to the place where he witnessed the violence as a teenager.\n\nOne of the dwindling number of Holocaust survivors, Frankenstein needed a walker as he slowly entered the compound where the Auerbach\u2019sches Waisenhaus orphanage once stood. But his memory is still sharp, and he remembers exactly how the events unfolded that night.\n\n\u201cA few hours after the plain clothes police officer had warned us, a group of men in uniforms came and told us, \u2018you need to leave now, we want to set fire to the building,\u2019\u201d Frankenstein said during an interview with The Associated Press this week.\n\nThere would have been no way to take the youngest children to a safe place that quickly, he said. Frankenstein and some of the older boys at the home managed to convince the uniformed men, who belonged to the paramilitary SA, that if they burned down the orphanage the fire would spread to surrounding buildings.\n\n\u201cSo instead, they went into our synagogue and turned off the sanctuary light in front of the holy ark,\u201d Frankenstein said. \u201cThey did not turn off the gas and after they left, we suddenly could smell gas everywhere inside the building.\u201d Frankenstein and his peers ran inside the synagogue, tore open all windows, and turned off the gas before it could lead to an explosion.\n\n\u201cThe men probably thought that if enough gas would stream out, the building would blow up,\u201d he said.\n\nKristallnacht is often referred to as the beginning of the Holocaust. It would still be years before the Nazis formally adopted their \u201cFinal Solution\u201d for the Jews of Europe, when boycotts, anti-Semitism legislation and expulsions would evolve into a policy of mass murder. In all, 6 million European Jews were killed in the Holocaust.\n\nGuy Miron, who heads Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem\u2019s Center for Research on the Holocaust in Germany, said Kristallnacht represented an end to Jewish life in Germany, a point of no return.\n\n\u201cUntil then, the Jews could still try to convince themselves that the wheel could be turned back. After it, the rupture was complete. They realized it was over,\u201d he said at a Yad Vashem event this week marking the anniversary. \u201cBefore Kristallnacht people emigrated. After it, they fled.\u201d\n\nStanding under an old poplar tree shedding its bright yellow leaves, Frankenstein gazed at a red brick wall \u2014 the only remainder of the orphanage in the city\u2019s Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood. The building was badly destroyed during a World War II air raid in 1943, and the ruins were torn down in the 1950s.\n\nThe wall was turned into a memorial for those Jewish orphans who did not survive the Holocaust, with the names and ages of 140 children inscribed on the bricks. The youngest one, Cilla Fuks, was ten months old when she was murdered.\n\nFrankenstein was one of the few who survived. In 1943 he went into hiding with his wife Leonie, whom he had met at the orphanage, as the Nazis were deporting thousands of Jews from Berlin to Auschwitz.\n\n\u201cWe had promised ourselves not to do what Hitler wanted,\u201d he said, still feisty after all these years. \u201cSo we went into hiding.\u201d\n\nTogether with their newborn son Uri, the couple spent 25 months in hiding in Berlin. A second son, Michael, was born in 1944, during their time on the run.\n\nIn 1945, after the collapse of the Nazis\u2019 Third Reich, the Frankensteins immigrated to what was then still Palestine. Eleven years later, in 1956, they moved from Israel to Sweden where they settled for good.\n\nNowadays, Walter Frankenstein returns to Germany several times a year. He often talks to schoolchildren about his life and on Friday, the anniversary of November 9, 1938, he will be honored in an award-giving ceremony by Germany\u2019s Culture Minister Monika Gruetters.\n\nIn 2014, he received Germany\u2019s highest civil honor, the Federal Cross of Merit.\n\nEvery time Frankenstein travels to Berlin, he brings along the small blue case containing the cross. Inside the case\u2019s lid, he has attached the first \u201cmark\u201d he got from the Germans: The Yellow Badge, or Jewish Star, that he had to wear during the Nazi reign to identify him as a Jew.\n\n\u201cThe first one marked me, the second one honored me,\u201d he said as he slowly closed the lid.\n\n___\n\nDavid Rising contributed reporting from Berlin, Aron Heller from Jerusalem and Randy Herschaft from New York.\n\nFollow Kirsten Grieshaber at twitter.com/kugrieshaber", "OSCEOLA, Iowa (AP) \u2014 A southern Iowa county attorney accused of being drunk in a courtroom has lost her bid for another term in office.\n\nClarke County election records say Michelle Rivera, a Democratic incumbent, received a little over 29 percent of the vote in her loss Tuesday to Republican Adam Ramsey.\n\nCourt documents say the 42-year-old Rivera is charged with public intoxication .

(Stephen M. Dowell/Orlando Sentinel via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 This week\u2019s midterm elections offered revealing lessons for both parties as battle lines begin to emerge for the 2020 presidential election.\n\nFor Democrats, a string of statewide victories in Rust Belt states opened a potential path back to the White House. But President Donald Trump\u2019s Republican Party found strength in critical states that often hold the keys to the presidency.\n\nPerhaps no state offered Democrats more hope than Wisconsin, which shocked the party in 2016 by narrowly falling into Trump\u2019s column. Republican Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s narrow loss in his bid for a third term left Democrats optimistic they could reclaim Wisconsin along with other traditionally blue states that Trump carried, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cTo have Walker lose is a significant turning point that the right candidate in 2020 could win all of these states\u201d across the industrial north, Democratic pollster Paul Maslin, who advised Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin\u2019s campaign. \u201cIf they do, Trump\u2019s map starts to get more difficult.\u201d\n\nStill, there are plenty of reasons for caution for Democrats. Gains in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania were offset by mixed results in Ohio and GOP dominance in electoral powerhouse Florida.\n\nIn Ohio, Republicans came out on top in the governor\u2019s race and a handful of other statewide offices. The GOP kept their 12-4 majority in the U.S. House delegation.\n\nOhio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, who won another term representing a district that Hillary Clinton won in 2016, called it a \u201creally bad election night\u201d for his party. But he said Democrats were able to win when they focused on \u201cbread-and-butter economic issues,\u201d the way he and Sen. Sherrod Brown, who also won re-election Tuesday, did.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not connecting with the workers, then you\u2019re not going to be able to do well,\u201d Ryan said in an interview. \u201cTrump connected to the workers. If we don\u2019t do that, if we\u2019re continuing to be seen as elite and that people are \u2018deplorables\u2019 if they don\u2019t vote for us, we\u2019re going to have a big problem.\u201d\n\nIn his victory speech, Brown said his state had provided a \u201cblueprint for America in 2020.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, though, pointed to Trump\u2019s 8-point victory in Ohio in 2016, and the four campaign visits he made to the state, including a southwest Ohio jaunt three weeks before the election. Trump remains very popular in the region, spanning from the politically swing-voting Hamilton County eastward along a string of Ohio River counties that the president carried by more than 30 percentage points.\n\nThe area\u2019s white and vastly rural profile outside Cincinnati is part of what is expected to keep Ohio from springing back easily for Democrats, Hamilton County Republican Chairman Alex Triantafilou said.\n\n\u201cI think southwest Ohio is becoming more reliably red under President Trump,\u201d Triantafilou said. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a turnout benefit to talking to conservatives the way Trump has.\u201d\n\nThere were also warning signs for Democrats in Florida, a perennial swing state that is increasingly delivering victories \u2014 however narrow \u2014 to the GOP. Republican Ron DeSantis defeated Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, handing Democrats their third consecutive loss for the Florida governor\u2019s mansion. Adding to their trouble was incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson trailing Republican Rick Scott.\n\nOne bright note for Democrats in Florida was the passage of Amendment 4, which will restore voting rights to most felons when they complete their sentences and probation, adding 1.4 million possible voters to the rolls. It\u2019s unclear how this group of people will affect the 2020 election.\n\nDemocrats also see bright signs in places like Nevada, once a conservative state that is now more consistently trending blue. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Democratic campaign for Senate in Texas fell short by less than 3 percentage points in Texas, a GOP-heavy state that hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1994. And Democrat Stacey Abrams ran a competitive campaign for governor in Georgia, which hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat to the governor\u2019s mansion since 1998.\n\n\u201cThere are some assumptions about states Democratic presidential candidates will visit that are being truly reconsidered,\u201d Democratic strategist Anita Dunn said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about changing the map.\u201d\n\nTensions were already flaring over what type of candidate could capitalize on the emerging 2020 map.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a huge field, but the big question will be whether they learn lessons from the midterms because I think the electorate was trying to tell us something loudly and clearly,\u201d Matt Bennett of Third Way, a centrist think tank, said in an interview. \u201cThe message they were trying to send us is you\u2019ve got to beat Trump in the battleground states, and you\u2019ve got to run on very mainstream, nonextreme Democratic ideals and values.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people that ran that way won in those tough places,\u201d Bennett added, \u201cand the people who didn\u2019t run that way lost almost everywhere.\u201d\n\nBut Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said he saw a shifting center of gravity within the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cThanks to Stacey Abrams, Andrew Gillum and Beto O\u2019Rourke, places where Democrats have had trouble winning for years became unpredictable toss-ups in large part because of an electorate inspired by never-before-heard bold visions for economic and racial justice,\u201d Green said.", "European Chief Negotiator for the United Kingdom Exiting the European Union, French Michel Barnier and Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, right, at the European People's Party (EPP) congress in Helsinki, Finland, Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018. (Markku Ulander/Lehtikuva via AP)\n\nHELSINKI (AP) \u2014 The European Union\u2019s Brexit negotiator on Thursday said that gaps remain to be bridged in talks on the U.K.\u2019s departure from the bloc as time runs out to secure a deal and have it endorsed.\n\nBritain leaves the EU on March 29, but a deal must be sealed in the coming weeks to leave enough time for the U.K. Parliament and European Parliament to sign off on it.\n\n\u201cWe need much more work\u201d to clinch an agreement, Michel Barnier told The Associated Press on the sidelines of a gathering of center-right political parties in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nThe main obstacle to an agreement is how to keep goods flowing smoothly across the border between the Republic of Ireland, an EU member, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K. All parties have committed to avoid a \u201chard border\u201d with costly, time-consuming border checks that would hamper business. Any new customs posts on the border could also re-ignite lingering sectarian tensions.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Juha Sipila said, however, that major progress in Brexit talks was likely \u201cwithin a week,\u201d based on his discussions with several visiting EU leaders and European Council President Donald Tusk, who chairs summits of the EU\u2019s 28 leaders.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going through crucial days now. We\u2019re very close now,\u201d Sipila told reporters.\n\nEuropean leaders are awaiting Barnier\u2019s assessment as to whether sufficient progress has been made in the Brexit negotiations for an EU summit to be convened to announce a deal. Rumors are swirling that one might take place by the end of November, weeks ahead of a pre-planned EU summit in mid-December, but Barnier declined to say when or if that would happen.\n\nIn Paris, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said Brexit negotiations are in \u201cthe final phase\u201d and he is confident an agreement will be reached.\n\n\u201cSeven days is probably pushing it, but I am optimistic that there will be a Brexit deal,\u201d Hunt said, adding it is \u201cvery, very difficult to resolve but I am confident that we can.\u201d\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, in Helsinki, said that British Prime Minister Theresa May \u201cis, as we are, decided to have the deal, and we will have a deal.\u201d\n\nLater, addressing leaders of the European People\u2019s Party group, Barnier warned of the threat that rising nationalism and populism pose to the EU ahead of European Parliament elections in May. He referred to Nigel Farage, the former U.K. Independence Party leader who helped convinced many Britons to vote for Brexit.\n\n\u201cThis election will be tougher than those before,\u201d Barnier said. \u201cWe will have to fight against those who want to demolish Europe \u2014 their fear, their populist deceit, their attacks against the European project. There is now a Farage in every country.\u201d\n\nThe European elections will be the first of the post-Brexit era.\n\nEurope\u2019s incapacity to manage migration has fueled far-right sentiment across the continent and many worry that nationalists might make more progress in May. The slow pace of Brexit talks and the standoff between the EU and Italy over the budget plans of the populist government in Rome are reminders of the kinds of upheavals that might occur if disenchanted European voters look to the right or far-right for answers.\n\n___\n\nDavid Keyton in Helsinki and John Leicester in Paris contributed to this report.", "VRIGNE-MEUSE, France (AP) \u2014 Augustin Trebuchon is buried beneath a white lie.\n\nHis tiny plot is almost on the front line where the guns finally fell silent at 11 a.m. on the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, after a four-year war that had already killed millions.\n\nA simple white cross says: \u201cDied for France on Nov. 10, 1918.\u201d\n\nNot so.\n\nLike hundreds of others along the Western Front, Trebuchon was killed in combat on the morning of Nov. 11 \u2014 after the pre-dawn agreement between the Allies and Germany but before the armistice took effect six hours later.\n\nHis death at almost literally the eleventh hour only highlighted the folly of a war that had become ever more incomprehensible to many in nations drawn into the first global conflict.\n\nBefore Nov. 11, the war had killed 14 million people, including 9 million soldiers, sailors and airmen from 28 countries. Germany came close to a quick, early victory before the war settled into hellish trench fighting. One battle, like the Somme in France, could have up to 1 million casualties. The use of poison gas came to epitomize the ruthlessness of warfare that the world had never seen.\n\nFor the French, who lost up to 1.4 million troops, it was perhaps too poignant \u2014 or too shameful \u2014 to denote that Trebuchon had been killed on the very last morning, just as victory finally prevailed.\n\n\u201cIndeed, on the tombs it said \u2018Nov. 10, 1918,\u2019 to somewhat ease the mourning of families,\u201d said French military historian Nicolas Czubak.\n\nThere were many reasons why men kept falling until the call of the bugler at 11 a.m.: fear that the enemy would not abide by the armistice, a sheer hatred after four years of unprecedented slaughter, the ambition of commanders craving a last victory, bad communications, the inane joy of killing.\n\nAs the hours ticked down, villages were taken, attacks were thwarted with heavy losses and rivers were crossed under enemy fire. Questions remain whether the gains were worth all the human losses.\n\nHistorian Joseph Persico estimated the total dead, wounded and missing on all sides on the final day was 10,900.\n\nU.S. Gen. John J. Pershing, who had been bent on continuing the fighting, even had to explain to Congress the high number of last-day losses.\n\nOther nations also were not spared such casualties.\n\nWith two minutes to go, 25-year-old Canadian Pvt. George Lawrence Price was slain by a German sniper.\n\nAbout 250 kilometers (150 miles) away in France, a 23-year-old American, Henry Gunther, was killed by German machine-gun fire one minute before the armistice.\n\nTrebuchon, 40, also was shot minutes before the cease-fire. He was running to tell his comrades where and when they would have a meal after the armistice.\n\nAll three are considered their nations\u2019 last men to fall in active combat.\n\n___\n\n\u201cTHE FUTILITY OF THE LARGER WAR\u201d\n\nAnti-German sentiment ran high after the United States declared war in April 1917, and Gunther and his family in Baltimore were subjected to the kind of prejudice and suspicion that many of German descent faced at the time.\n\n\u201cIt was not a good time to be German in the United States,\u201d said historian Alec Bennett.\n\nGunther had little choice when he got drafted. He was given the rank of sergeant, but he later was demoted when he wrote a letter home critical of the conditions in the war.\n\nSoon after, he was thrown into the biggest U.S. battle of the war, the Meuse-Argonne offensive in northeastern France.\n\nThere were reports he was still brooding over his demotion right on Nov. 11. When he emerged from a thick fog in the valley around Chaumont-devant-Damvillers, he and his comrades faced a German machine gun nest on the hillside.\n\nIndications are that the Germans fired one salvo over his head as a warning, knowing the war was almost over. But he still charged onward.\n\n\u201cHis time of death was 10:59 a.m., which is just so haunting,\u201d Bennett said. Gunther was recognized by Pershing as the last American to die on the battlefield.\n\nQuestions remain whether it was a suicide run, an attempt at redemption or an act of true devotion.\n\n\u201cIt is just as puzzling now as it was 100 years ago,\u201d Bennett said, adding that one thing is clear: \u201cGunther\u2019s act is seen as almost a symbol of the futility of the larger war.\u201d\n\nBut there was one more cruel twist for his family: They were unaware he had been killed.\n\nUpon his expected return \u201cthey went to the train station to meet Henry \u2014 not there!\u201d said Bruce Malone, superintendent of Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery, the final resting place for 100 Americans who died Nov. 11.\n\n___\n\n\u201cA NEED TO KILL ONE LAST TIME\u201d\n\nThere was no mystery surrounding the death of Price, the Canadian. It was an utterly senseless loss of life.\n\nHe was a farm laborer in Saskatchewan when the swirl of history plucked him off the land in October 1917 as the Allies sought ever more manpower for the Western Front.\n\nThe summer after he was drafted, he was part of the surge of victories that seized villages and cities right up to Nov. 11. By that time, Canadians were retaking Mons in southern Belgium, where soldiers from the British Commonwealth had their very first battle with the Germans in August 1914.\n\nIt was especially sweet for the Commonwealth commanders to retake the city, bringing the war full circle where they lost their first soldier, English Pvt. John Parr, on Aug. 21, 1914.\n\nPrice decided to check out homes along the canals while civilians in the center of Mons had already broken out the wine and whiskey they had hidden for years from the Germans to celebrate with the Canadians.\n\nSuddenly, a shot rang out and Price collapsed.\n\n\u201cIt really was one man, here and there, who was driven by vengeance, by a need to kill one last time,\u201d said Belgian historian Corentin Rousman.\n\nThe final minutes counted not just for the casualties but also for the killers.\n\n\u201cThere are rules in war,\u201d Rousman said. \u201cThere is always the possibility to kill two minutes before a cease-fire. Two minutes after, the German would have had to stand before a judge. That\u2019s the difference.\u201d\n\nAt the St. Symphorien cemetery just outside Mons, Price, the last Commonwealth soldier killed in the war, lies a stone\u2019s throw from Parr, the first.\n\n\u201cHe is not forgotten,\u201d Rousman said of Price. \u201cIt\u2019s a soldier whose tomb is often draped in flowers.\u201d\n\n___\n\n\u201cPART OF THIS GREAT PATRIOTIC MOMENTUM\u201d\n\nTrebuchon\u2019s grave stands out because of the date, underscoring the random fortunes of war.\n\nHe was a shepherd from France\u2019s Massif Central and could have avoided the war as a family breadwinner at age 36.\n\n\u201cBut he was part of this great patriotic momentum,\u201d said Jean-Christophe Chanot, the mayor of Vrigne-Meuse, where he died.\n\nTrebuchon knew misery as part of France\u2019s most brutal battles \u2014 Marne, Somme, Verdun. He survived right up to his last order \u2014 to tell soldiers where to gather after the armistice.\n\nInstead, his body was found with a bullet wound to the head. He was recognized as \u201cthe last French soldier killed during the last French attack against the Germans,\u201d Chanot said.\n\nThe date on his grave \u2014 Nov. 10, 1918 \u2014 remains controversial, even if it was meant to soothe a family\u2019s sorrow.\n\n\u201cIt was a lie, without a question,\u201d said Czubak, the French historian.\n\n___\n\nPhotojournalist Virginia Mayo and video journalist Mark Carlson contributed.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press\u2019 WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

(AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski)\n\nWARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 Poland\u2019s main gas company signed a long-term contract Thursday to receive deliveries of liquefied natural gas from the United States as part of a larger effort to reduce its energy dependence on Russia.\n\nThe state company PGNiG signed the 24-year deal with American supplier Cheniere during a ceremony in Warsaw attended by U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Polish President Andrzej Duda.\n\n\u201cThis is a sign across Europe that this is how your energy security will be developed, your energy sources diversified,\u201d Perry said before the deal was signed.\n\nHe and Polish Energy Minister Krzysztof Tchorzewski also signed an agreement to confirm long-term cooperation on energy security, which Perry said indicated America\u2019s \u201cpro-Poland and pro-Europe\u201d approach to developing diverse sources of energy.\n\n\u201cWe are prepared to be a competitive, reliable and transparent\u201d partner, he said.\n\nPerry is visiting several countries in central and eastern Europe to expand energy partnerships in the region, the U.S. Department of Energy said.\n\nThe value of the deal with the Polish company was not disclosed, in line with traditional secrecy for such energy deals.\n\nHowever, Piotr Wozniak, the president of PGNiG\u2019s management board, said the price is 20-30 percent lower than what Poland pays its current supplier in Russia.\n\nUnder the deal, Poland will receive some 700 million cubic meters of gas from 2019 through 2022, and 39 billion cubic meters from 2023 through 2042. Poland\u2019s annual consumption of gas is almost 16 billion cubic meters, 25 percent of which is covered from Poland\u2019s own deposits.\n\nWozniak said the deal would also provide a safety net to protect neighboring Ukraine, a transit route for Russian gas, from unexpected breaks in Russian gas deliveries. PGNiG is planning two more deals for U.S. gas deliveries, he said.\n\nPoland and Ukraine feel especially concerned about their level of dependence on Russia energy supplies, which Moscow has used as political leverage in the past.\n\nTheir anxieties have increased because of a German-Russian project to build Nord Stream 2, a second pipeline under the Baltic Sea that would deliver gas directly from St. Petersburg to Germany, and to other European countries, while bypassing Poland and the route through Ukraine.\n\nPerry said the U.S. opposes Nord Stream 2 because it thinks the pipeline project would increase the region\u2019s dependence on Russian gas.\n\nThe gas will be delivered by ship from terminals in Louisiana and Texas to a liquefied natural gas terminal in Swinoujscie, in the northwest, on Poland\u2019s Baltic coast.\n\nIn October, PGNiG signed a separate long-term contract for the purchase of some 40 million tons, or over 50 billion cubic meters, of liquefied natural gas from Louisiana-based Venture Global Calcasieu Pass and Venture Global Plaquemines LNG.\n\nThe deal, the first of its kind in central and eastern Europe, was meant to replace an expiring deal with Russia\u2019s Gazprom that Poland said cost too much.\n\n___\n\nVanessa Gera in Warsaw contributed to this report.", "FILE - In this Sept. 26, 2018, file photo, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg leaves the stage after speaking to first-year students at Georgetown Law in Washington. Ginsburg has been hospitalized after fracturing three ribs in fall at court (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Eighty-five-year-old Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fractured three ribs in a fall in her office at the court and is in the hospital, the court said Thursday.\n\nThe court\u2019s oldest justice fell Wednesday evening, the court said. She called Supreme Court police to take her to George Washington University Hospital in Washington early Thursday after experiencing discomfort overnight, court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said.\n\nShe was admitted to the hospital for treatment and observation after tests showed she fractured three ribs.\n\nIn her absence, the court went ahead Thursday with a courtroom ceremony welcoming new Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who joined the court last month. President Donald Trump and new acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker were on hand.\n\nGinsburg has had a series of health problems. She broke two ribs in a fall in 2012. She has had two prior bouts with cancer and had a stent implanted to open a blocked artery in 2014. She also was hospitalized after a bad reaction to medicine in 2009.\n\nBut she has never missed Supreme Court arguments. The court won\u2019t hear arguments again until Nov. 26.\n\nRib fractures are common among older adults, particularly after falls. The severity depends in part on whether the ribs are cracked or broken all the way through, and how many are broken. The extent of Ginsburg\u2019s injury was not clear.\n\nA complete break requires making sure the two ends are in alignment, so that a sharp piece of bone doesn\u2019t puncture nearby blood vessels or organs. Broken ribs typically heal on their own in six weeks to a month, and patients are advised to limit strenuous activity. But they can be very painful and controlling pain is key. A chief complication is pneumonia, when patients don\u2019t breathe deeply enough or cough enough because of the rib pain.\n\nAppointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, Ginsburg rebuffed suggestions from some liberals that she should step down in the first two years of President Barack Obama\u2019s second term, when Democrats also controlled the Senate and would have been likely to confirm her successor.\n\nShe already has hired clerks for the term that extends into 2020, indicating she has no plans to retire.\n\nGinsburg leads the court\u2019s liberal wing.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lauran Neergaard contributed to this report.", "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 American Airlines volunteers are gathering to pack 5,000 boxes of food for Florida communities affected by recent hurricanes.\n\nTeam members planned to gather Thursday at one of the airline\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport hangars.

But what happens when you apply such an internet-connected network to nature?\n\nA research team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has been trying it out at Tidmarsh, a former cranberry bog converting back to natural wetlands just a few miles from where the Pilgrims landed in 1620.\n\nRemotely spying on nature isn\u2019t new, but the project goes far beyond simple webcams fixed on a hawk\u2019s nest or sea lions\u2019 favorite pier \u2014 or even the more sophisticated acoustic sensors designed to detect animal poachers.\n\nThe team\u2019s goals for what they call the Living Observatory include supporting wildlife restoration efforts. The sensors measure temperature, moisture and other environmental conditions.\n\nBut a broader mission is to offer people \u2014 including children \u2014 a deeper understanding of nature using their laptops, phones or headsets. They can do so remotely or in person while walking a nature trail, said the project\u2019s visionary, Glorianna Davenport, a retired professor and co-founder of the MIT Media Lab.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous to walk in the woods and not be fiddling with a cell phone,\u201d Davenport said. On the other hand, she added, what if you can learn more about the microbial environment, or the return of an endangered species, from a well-crafted smartphone app or a virtual reality game?\n\nIf it works here, Davenport said, researchers are already envisioning more ambitious projects deep in the Amazon rainforest \u2014 or on the moon.\n\nThe idea has skeptics who are worried about the intrusion of technology and constant surveillance into the world\u2019s last places without it . The Massachusetts Audubon Society manages the 480-acre sanctuary and took some time before it agreed to outfit it with live-streaming cameras and microphones. It was assured that human voices would be scrambled.\n\nEducators have also asked Davenport why she would want to encourage kids to carry around their smartphones instead of just appreciating nature without them.\n\n\u201cAnd I went, \u2018Why not?\u2019 That\u2019s how they learn. That is their mechanism of interacting,\u201d she said.\n\nThe sanctuary is beginning to flourish as it changes from a heavily-fertilized industrial cranberry farm into a wetland full of insects, birds and native plants. The base camp for MIT scholars is also Davenport\u2019s home, which she built in 1999 after first visiting the property in the early 1980s. As landowners, she and her husband partnered with Audubon to transform the land into what it might have looked like before it was carved into manmade bogs in the 19th century.\n\nThe research projects reflect the diverse interests of multimedia scholars. Davenport is a documentary filmmaker. Others are computer scientists or musicians.\n\nOne project creates soundtracks driven by sensor readings \u2014 such as higher pitches that indicate warmer temperatures.\n\nAnother resembles a more ethereal version of the Pokemon Go augmented reality game, but with elk-like phantoms galloping around a virtual world modeled on the marsh. If the sensors pick up a rainstorm at the real-life Tidmarsh, the animated creatures appear to get wet. If there\u2019s a loud, sudden sound, they become startled.\n\nYet another experiment involves strapping on a special headset while walking through the sanctuary. On a hot afternoon in late summer, MIT researcher Gershon Dublon and his colleagues tromped around the preserve in chest-high waders to show how the sensors can amplify a human\u2019s observation of nature.\n\n\u201cThe forest is a lot more active than you would think, because wildlife is quieter when you\u2019re nearby,\u201d Dublon said.\n\nThe headset endows its users with a kind of supersensory power. Tap one ear and you can zoom your hearing toward a nearby pond where ducks are swimming. Gaze in another direction, tap again and listen in on a secluded spot beneath a canopy of trees.\n\nIt\u2019s a chance to hear elusive animals that scurry away long before humans get anywhere near them.\n\nYou can also travel in time, as MIT Media Lab professor Joseph Paradiso did last week \u2014 transporting himself out of the sleepy November landscape by tapping into sounds picked up from the same place six months earlier.\n\n\u201cWe played the spring, and to me, that was a revelation,\u201d he said. \u201cHearing a dead landscape come alive as if you\u2019re there.\u201d", "Fed is set to keep rates on hold before a hike later in year\n\nFILE- In this Oct. 31, 2018, file photo Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, left, and Randal Quarles, vice chair for supervision, gather their things at the end of a Federal Reserve Board meeting at the Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building in Washington. On Thursday, Nov. 8, the Federal Reserve releases its latest monetary policy statement after a two-day meeting. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Federal Reserve appears on track to raise interest rates once more this year but will likely hold off on any action when its latest policy meeting ends Thursday.\n\nStill, investors will be parsing the statement the Fed will issue after its meeting for any sign that it might be rethinking its probable pace of credit tightening in the coming months. So far this year, the central bank has raised rates three times.\n\nAt their most recent meeting in late September, Fed officials collectively projected that they would end up raising their key short-term rate four times this year and three times in 2019. The Fed\u2019s benchmark rate affects many consumer and business loans, and when it raises it, borrowing can become more expensive for many.\n\nIn recent weeks, financial markets have been gripped by worry and volatility, and some analysts think that in its statement Thursday the Fed may take note of that anxiety as a potential risk to economic growth.\n\nAs it happens, this week\u2019s meeting will be the last that will not include a news conference by the Fed chairman. Beginning in 2019, Chairman Jerome Powell has said he will hold a news conference after each of the Fed\u2019s eight meetings each year, rather than only at every other meeting.\n\nIn its statement, the Fed is all but sure to announce that it will keep its key rate unchanged in a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent, the level it reached in September when the Fed raised it for the third time this year.\n\nBeginning in late 2015, the central bank has gradually raised its key rate from a record low near zero, where it had held it since the 2008 financial crisis to try to stabilize the financial system and stimulate growth. With the economy growing briskly and in its 10th year of expansion \u2014 the second-longest stretch on record \u2014 the Fed is aiming to keep future inflation under control.\n\nSome analysts say they think the fundamental message from the Fed on Thursday will be that with a strong economy and unemployment at a near five-decade low of 3.7 percent, steady if modest rate hikes should remain in place for now. Last week, the government said that employers added a robust 250,000 jobs in October and that average pay grew 3.1 percent over the previous 12 months \u2014 the best year-over-year gain in a decade.\n\n\u201cLook for the statement following the meeting to highlight the recent and welcome pickup in wages and the further drop in the unemployment rate,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n\nThe quickened pace of economic growth \u2014 a 3.5 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, after a 4.2 percent rate the previous quarter \u2014 has raised the risk that inflation could begin accelerating. So far, though, inflation has remained around the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target for annual price increases.\n\nIn its most recent forecast, the Fed projected that it would raise rates three additional times in 2019 but private economists are split. Some believe there will be four hikes in 2019 as the Fed responds to continued strong growth while some see only one or two hikes next year as the boost from the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts passed last year begins to fade.\n\nPowell has stressed that the Fed is determined to follow a centrist approach: Keep gradually nudging up rates to control inflation but avoid tightening too aggressively and perhaps triggering a recession.\n\nBut President Donald Trump has sharply disagreed, and since the stock market started tumbling last month, he has attacked the Fed\u2019s rate hikes as well as Powell\u2019s leadership.\n\nTrump\u2019s public criticism has aroused concern that he is intruding on the political independence the Fed needs to assure markets that it will make tough choices when needed to keep inflation under control.\n\nWhile Trump has called the Fed\u2019s rate hikes his \u201cbiggest threat,\u201d Powell, who was Trump\u2019s hand-picked choice to lead the Fed, has avoided responding directly to the criticism. He has instead expressed determination to pursue the Fed\u2019s mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices without regard to political considerations.", "ROANOKE, Va.

It was almost hard to separate the way playing football made you feel from how being at a great concert was. Music is such a primal force: it\u2019s inside us, without thinking.\n\n\u201cI think playing sports is the same way. How you feel when you\u2019re on the field, that immediate rush is the ultimate high. When I started playing for tips and burritos at Quarterback\u2019s, it was the same thing \u2014 only less intense, because there were so many variables. But as time went on, as I learned about writing songs, really dialing in on life and performing so I know I\u2019m reaching people at the back of the room, that intensity of how it feels when it\u2019s right became the same thing. When the drum kicks, the lights start and you can hear the crowd even before the curtain falls, it\u2019s like that first play of the night. ... It\u2019s on, and there\u2019s nowhere in the world you\u2019d rather be.\u201d\n\nChesney spends up to three hours on the stage performing a collection of hits pretty much unequaled among contemporaries in any music genre. It\u2019s an exhausting trip for virtually everyone: band members, stagehands, crew and, of course, the audience. And it\u2019s worth every second.\n\nNFL games generally last about that long and can create the same aura.\n\n\u201cIf we do it right, hopefully we wring every spec of energy out of the fans,\u201d Chesney explains. \u201cSometimes you can feel a slight ebb during the last song. But what\u2019s more likely to happen, the energy feeds itself, so by the end, they\u2019re hitting a whole other plateau. They may sleep til 2 the next day, but they\u2019re bringing it hard, and they\u2019re not quitting.\n\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s part of how the band and I can also build our energy: No Shoes Nation feeds us. We go out to give them absolutely everything, but I always say, they give us more than we give them.\u201d\n\nRobert Kraft would agree. The owner of the New England Patriots is a certified member of No Shoes Nation. He has had a special relationship with Chesney since 2005, when the first of 19 concerts at Gillette Stadium took place.\n\n\u201cKenny\u2019s music is truly one of a kind. It has this unique and special quality to it that takes people to a place where they can forget the day-to-day worries of life and enjoy the moment, whether in the car listening to the radio or in stadium full of people singing along. When you see Kenny live in concert, his personal energy and charisma is like no one else,\u201d Kraft said. \u201cHe brings you into the melody and the moment, and it takes those feelings to an entirely different level. After 14 years and 19 shows at Gillette Stadium, I continue to be blown away by the way Kenny and his music affects people. It truly is one of my favorite scenes, seeing 60,000 happy, glowing faces taking in the timeless greatness that is Kenny Chesney.\u201d\n\nChesney is the biggest ticket seller for any musical genre at MetLife Stadium, where Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi and Taylor Swift have been regulars. The Trip Around The Sun show at MetLife Stadium in August was delayed by a severe thunderstorm before one of the accompanying bands, Old Dominion, took the stage. That also pushed back the set by Thomas Rhett and Chesney, who played and sang beyond midnight.\n\nYet, just as they would for a big game involving the Giants or Jets, the fans remained, their enthusiasm only whetted, not wetted down.\n\n\u201cThere are two things,\u201d says Chesney, whose most recent chart-topping album, \u201cSongs For The Saints,\u201d is a tribute to the Virgin Islands that were devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria last year. Chesney had a home on St. John. \u201cOne, I think sports and music are the two things people are truly passionate about, so there\u2019s always going to be similarities in the response. I know plenty of football fans are out there; heck, there\u2019s a lot of players, the coaching staff, people affiliated with the teams at the shows.\n\n\u201cBut just as importantly, there\u2019s that sense of pride in what No Shoes Nation stands for. For the fans who are just music people, they have the same connection to how the songs we sing hold their lives as sports fans have about their team kind of representing the best of who they are. You know, there\u2019s no thrill greater than high school football, and seeing your team rush out on the field, and I think that carries over to the NFL for adults, and just people who remember when.\u201d\n\nThose folks tend to remember when they witnessed a particularly memorable game. They definitely recall attending \u2014 and being such a large part of \u2014 a Chesney concert.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anything surpasses the excitement of seeing your favorite team play,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I do think people who come to these stadiums really bring their most passionate selves. When they come to these places \u2014 Levi Stadium, Arrowhead Stadium, Raymond James Stadium \u2014 they come to throw everything they have at their team.\n\n\u201cAnd I think they bring that mindset when they walk in the door for our shows, too.\u201d\n\nChesney has not committed to another stadium tour. In 2019, he is planning a more intimate series of concerts. But perhaps the unforgettable vibes from the previous concerts will lead to another Trip Around the Sun.\n\nRegardless, Chesney and No Shoes Nation have proven the bond between music and sports is unbreakable.\n\n\u201cI love football, and the discipline that goes into playing it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky to be friends with Sean Payton, the Manning family, Drew Brees, a lot of those guys, not to mention so many people a casual fan might not know. I\u2019ve been to practice; I\u2019ve been to games. I still get a little amazed that I know every inch of a lot of these buildings I see on TV every week, because I stopped growing in the ninth grade, and that was the end of any dream of playing sports for a living.\n\n\u201cWhen I think about that, or when I\u2019m onstage, and looking all the way to the top, it\u2019s a pretty unbelievable feeling. All those games, all that energy, and we get to be part of these places in a way that\u2019s just as passionate and intense in a whole other way. It reminds me how powerful music can be.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "", "", "1 of 4 San Antonio Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan (10) drives as Miami Heat center Hassan Whiteside defends during the second half of an NBA basketball game, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018, in Miami.

He\u2019s now second in the NBA at 15.2 rebounds per game, first at 3.4 blocked shots per game. And he anchored a defensive performance that allowed the Heat to become one of only five teams to win this season while scoring no more than 95 points.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very confident, man,\u201d Whiteside said. \u201cMy body feels great. I think a lot of people had written me off. That\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t need anybody\u2019s justification. But I feel like if I do those things for myself, it\u2019ll put me in the conversation of being an All-Star, being defensive player of the year.\u201d\n\nThe Spurs had seven players take more than three shots on Wednesday night; of those seven, six had at least one attempt erased by Whiteside.\n\nLaMarcus Aldridge shot 2 for 14 for the Spurs. Including playoff games, Aldridge has taken at least 14 shots in a game 686 times in his career. He\u2019s never had less success from the floor in any of those games than he had Wednesday; he was 2 for 14 on two other occasions.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t all Whiteside, but he was certainly a major factor.\n\n\u201cI think he had like 37 blocks at the half,\u201d Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said.\n\nActually, eight, but point taken.\n\nSince blocks became an official NBA stat in 1973-74, there have now been nine games where someone has had 29 points, 20 rebounds and nine blocks. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has four of them. Bob Lanier, Bob McAdoo, Hakeem Olajuwon, Elmore Smith and now Whiteside have the others. Heady company, since Abdul-Jabbar, Lanier, McAdoo and Olajuwon are all in the Hall of Fame.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like he\u2019s changing his mindset to be great,\u201d Heat center Bam Adebayo said.\n\nWhiteside was bitter and broken at the end of last season, basically benched for most of Miami\u2019s playoff series against Philadelphia, not shy about showing his frustration or venting about how he was being handled.\n\nFences with the team have long been mended. He and Heat coach Erik Spoelstra had hours-long lunches this summer, airing grievances, making their situation better. But Whiteside is still fueled by what he perceives is a lack of respect from the outside, and his teammates believe he\u2019s now starting to use that motivation the right way.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so long you can say no to the numbers,\u201d Whiteside said.\n\nIf they stay anything close to where he\u2019s at now, Whiteside might just be proved right.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "New Mexico candidate for congress Deb Haaland speaks to constituents at Barelas Coffee House restaurant in Albuquerque, N.M., on midterms election day Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

In an interview, Haaland, a former New Mexico Democratic Party chairwoman, credited a vast political network she built after nearly 20 years of working on other candidates\u2019 campaigns, her team and volunteers, and her own hard work.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother worked really hard; she expected us to work hard,\u201d Haaland said. \u201cI mean that in and of itself is what really sustained me. It\u2019s my work ethic.\u201d\n\nHaaland, who is 57, will replace U.S. Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat who ran successfully for governor this year. Her district covers Albuquerque and a handful of rural communities that include tribal communities.\n\nDavids\u2019 district, meanwhile, lies in the suburbs west of Kansas City. She unseated U.S. Rep. Kevin Yoder, a Republican. In addition to being one of the first Native American congresswomen, she\u2019ll also be the nation\u2019s first LGBT Native American to serve as a federal lawmaker.\n\nOn election night, Davids, a lawyer and former White House fellow, highlighted her life story of being raised by a single mother, being a first-generation college student and working while she was in school, saying those experiences were not unusual.\n\n\u201cWhat is uncommon, until now, is to have those voices and those stories and those experiences truly reflected in our federal government, in Congress and the Senate,\u201d she said.\n\nThe two women will join U.S. Reps. Tom Cole, who is Chickasaw, and Markwayne Mullin, an enrolled citizen of the Cherokee Nation, in the House. Cole and Mullin are Republicans, representing districts in Oklahoma.\n\nHaaland and Davids\u2019 wins marked an emotional high point for Kalyn Free, a citizen of the Choctaw Nation in Oklahoma and former district attorney in southeastern Oklahoma, who has been part of a decades-long push to get Native American women elected to Congress.\n\n\u201cl always say little Indian boys and little Indian girls cannot be what they cannot see,\u201d Free said. \u201cNow, there are going to be two male Republicans and two very outspoken, two talented Indian Democrat women who are going to be there as well.\u201d\n\nShe recalled donating to the 1992 congressional campaign of Ada Deer, a Menominee woman who ran as a Democrat for a seat in Wisconsin. Twelve years later, Free herself ran for Congress in Oklahoma and then founded INDN\u2019s List, a political organization that sought to recruit and build support for Native American candidates.\n\nIn the past, Free said many Native American women she supported faced a \u201cdouble barrier\u201d along race and gender lines in winning over donors who doubted their competitiveness. But Haaland and Davids toppled it.\n\nHaaland raised about $1.9 million, more than any of her opponents, despite hearing of doubts from other Democrats early in the race that she wouldn\u2019t be able to compete financially, she said. She cleared a crowded primary field before handily defeating former state lawmaker Janice Arnold-Jones, a Republican, in Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nDavids raised about $4.3 million, almost all of it since mid-July. The sum represented an unusually large amount of money for congressional races in the state. In the final full month of her race alone, she recorded a $1.16-million haul.\n\nFederal Election Commission filings showed both candidates benefiting from a mix of individual and super PAC contributions, as well as donations from numerous tribes in their states and beyond.\n\n\u201cWe have to compete at the same level,\u201d Free said. \u201cWe have to have money, professional staff, and data-driven campaigns. That\u2019s the difference.\u201d\n\nHaaland said her fundraising push included visits to tribes\u2019 administration buildings throughout the country, where she said she discussed a range of issues with tribal leaders.\n\nIn what has become a reliably Democratic district in the past decade, she ran on a progressive agenda that prioritized health care, public education and the environment, saying the issues span the interests of her constituents and Native Americans nationwide.\n\n\u201cI hope that I can help (tribes) to see some success with my win,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I go to Congress, it\u2019s, you know, them having a seat at the table. It\u2019s them having a voice.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas, contributed to this report.", "Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne, left, and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi shake hands at the end of a joint press conference at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018. The foreign ministers of China and Australia are meeting in what is being seen as a sign of a thaw in the recently frosty relationship between the key economic partners. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nBEIJING (AP) \u2014 The Australian government\u2019s rejection of a Chinese bid to take over an energy infrastructure company does not indicate a change in the country\u2019s openness to doing business with China, Foreign Minister Marie Payne said Thursday.\n\nSpeaking after a meeting in Beijing with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi that marked a thaw in recently chilly relations, Payne stressed \u201cthe importance of Australia\u2019s welcoming of Chinese investment in Australia.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Australia said it intends to block a Chinese and Hong Kong consortium\u2019s 13 billion Australian dollar ($9 billion) bid to take over the APA group.\n\nPayne said the government judged that the acquisition would have resulted in \u201can undue concentration of foreign ownership by a single company group in what is our most significant gas transmission business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe remain absolutely committed as a government to welcoming foreign investment into Australia. It supports jobs, it helps us to increase living standards,\u201d she said.\n\nPayne\u2019s meeting with Wang was seen indicating an improvement in ties between the key economic partners after months of tension over accusations of Chinese interference in Australian politics, media and academia. That threatened to upset political ties as well as economic relations with China, which buys about one-third of Australia\u2019s exports.\n\n\u201cI think the most important outcome of this dialogue is that we have reaffirmed the course of this relationship,\u201d Wang said after the meeting, which ran an hour longer than scheduled.\n\nAustralia has banned Chinese giants Huawei and ZTE Corp. from new telecommunications projects, and an Australian security think tank has raised concerns about increasing collaboration between Australian universities and China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army scientists on research programs such as hypersonic missiles and navigation technology.\n\nChina took particular offense at a new law passed after allegations of Chinese meddling in Australian politics and media exposes about the Communist Party\u2019s dealings with Chinese university students and the expatriate Chinese community in Australia.\n\nChina has denounced all accusations of interference as prejudiced \u201cCold War thinking\u201d and alleges that Australia\u2019s longstanding military alliance with the U.S. is intended to contain China\u2019s growing influence. Australia backs the U.S. in challenging China\u2019s territorial claims to virtually the entire the South China Sea by flying and sailing near Beijing-held islands.\n\nWhile seeking to improve ties with its biggest trading partner, Australia is also taking steps to shore up its presence in the Asia-Pacific, where China has sought to extend its economic, political and military influence.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday outlined plans to increase investments in infrastructure in the South Pacific and for greater military and diplomatic engagement with Australia\u2019s island neighbors, who are increasing looking to China for aid through Beijing\u2019s \u201cBelt and Road\u201d infrastructure program.\n\nAustralia has also announced it will invest in redeveloping a naval base in Papua New Guinea.\n\nResponding to a question on those moves, Wang said South Pacific island nations were entitled to make their own decisions about their foreign relations, but that China was willing to respond to their needs and \u201cengage in cooperation based on equality and for win-win outcomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina and Australia have our respective strengths when it comes to cooperation with Pacific island countries and in this regard, China and Australia are not competitors, not rivals, but cooperation partners,\u201d Wang said.\n\nHe and Payne agreed that \u201cChina\u2019s development poses no threat to Australia, but represents opportunities,\u201d Wang said, adding that the meeting constituted \u201can important engagement after the ups and downs this relationship went through.\u201d\n\nPayne said the ministers also discussed events in the northwestern Chinese region of Xinjiang, where the authorities have detained up to 1 million members of Muslim minority groups in camps in what Beijing calls a move to stamp out extremism.

Levin faces Republican candidate Diane Harkey in the race for California's 49th congressional district. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 California Republicans suffered twin setbacks in closely contested House races, allowing Democrats to pad their edge in Washington while delivering unwelcome news for a state GOP that has been drifting toward irrelevance.\n\nDemocrat Mike Levin Wednesday seized the Southern California House seat of retiring Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, President Barack Obama\u2019s one-time tormentor, while Rep. Steve Knight announced he\u2019d been defeated in the last Republican-held House seat anchored in Los Angeles County.\n\nThe victory by Levin, an environmental attorney, carries symbolic heft because of Issa\u2019s nearly two-decade tenure on Capitol Hill. During that time, the car-alarm magnate known as one of the wealthiest members of Congress emerged as Obama\u2019s chief antagonist while heading the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nLevin had about 54 percent of nearly 177,000 votes counted so far.\n\nThe race in the coastal 49th District in San Diego and Orange County between Levin and Republican rival Diane Harkey focused largely on President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, global warming and immigration.\n\nHarkey, a former state lawmaker, had been endorsed by the president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the traditional Orange County Republican embraces Trumpism,\u201d Levin told The Associated Press. He said voters in the district are concerned with coastal protection and climate change, issues threatened by the administration, and that Trump was the first Republican presidential candidate to lose Orange County since the Depression era.\n\nAbout a decade ago Republicans held a 20-point registration advantage over Democrats in the 49th District, which includes wealthy seaside enclaves but also diverse suburban communities. That double-digit margin has dwindled to single digits, while the number of independents soared.\n\nThe district was one of seven targeted by national Democrats after Hillary Clinton carried them in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nRepublicans have been struggling in the state for years. Democrats hold every statewide office, both chambers of the Legislature and a 3.7 million edge in voter registrations. There are more independents in California than Republicans.\n\nTrump also figured in the 25th District north of Los Angeles, where Knight conceded his seat to a Democratic newcomer, 31-year-old Katie Hill.\n\nKnight trailed Hill by 2.5 points with about 163,000 votes counted and thousands more left to be tallied. The Associated Press has not called the race.\n\nKnight, a former police officer, offered Hill his congratulations and said he was proud of his work on veterans\u2019 health care, small business development and defense issues.\n\n\u201cOur electoral process is integral to our identity as a free and fair society, and the voters have spoken,\u201d he said.\n\nHill stressed her centrist politics: She\u2019s a gun owner and her Republican father is a police officer who had never voted for a Democrat before her primary. Her mother, a Democrat, is a nurse.\n\n\u201cI look forward to working on behalf of everyone in this district to ensure we all have access to quality health care, housing we can afford, and a representative and transparent government which truly serves the people,\u201d she said.\n\nThe House battlegrounds ranged from Central Valley farmland to legendary surfing spots in Orange County and Knight\u2019s district, which cuts through suburbs, horse ranches and high desert in northern Los Angeles County and a small slice of Ventura County.\n\nIn San Diego County, Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter survived the election despite facing corruption charges. A 60-count federal grand jury indictment against him and his wife alleges the couple illegally used $250,000 in campaign funds for vacations, meals and other personal expenses.\n\nElsewhere, undecided races included re-election bids by Republican Reps. Mimi Walters and Dana Rohrabacher, who were fighting for survival in two Orange County districts they easily won two years ago.\n\nIn the 45th District, which has a 7-point GOP registration edge, Walters was leading law professor Katie Porter, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, by about 3 points with 184,000 votes counted.\n\nPorter had campaigned on overturning Trump\u2019s tax reform package and her support for universal health care.\n\nRohrabacher, known as Russia\u2019s leading defender on Capitol Hill, was in a tough race with Republican-turned-Democrat Harley Rouda in the 48th District, where the GOP has a 10-point registration edge.\n\nRouda, a real estate executive, has depicted the 15-term congressman as the face of Washington gridlock. Rouda was leading with 51 percent of the vote, with about 181,000 counted.\n\nIn retiring GOP Rep. Ed Royce\u2019s 39th District that includes part of Orange County, Republican Young Kim held a 3-point edge over Democrat Gil Cisneros, with about 150,000 votes counted. If elected, Kim would become the first Korean-American immigrant woman elected to the House.\n\nThe former state legislator worked for Royce for years and has positioned herself as a Trump supporter with an independent streak.\n\nCisneros, a first-time candidate who won a $266 million lottery jackpot, was looking for a big turnout from Hispanics who make up about a third of the population.\n\nHis campaign said in a statement there had been reports of possible voter intimidation at some polling locations in heavily Hispanic areas. Cisneros said he would ensure \u201cthat everyone who participated in this election has their voice heard.\u201d\n\nTwo other targeted Republicans, Reps. David Valadao and Jeff Denham, represent farm-belt districts where Democrats have more registered voters but are more moderate than in urban areas.\n\nValadao\u2019s 21st District includes parts of Fresno, Kern, Kings and Tulare counties. He won by a wide margin in 2016 and on Tuesday held off a challenge by Democrat T.J. Cox.\n\nCox tried to make the race a referendum on Valadao\u2019s support for President Donald Trump. In a tip to the district\u2019s heavy Hispanic population, Valadao touted his support for a way to keep in the country people who came as children when their parents illegally entered.\n\nIn the 10th District, anchored in Modesto, Denham was leading Democrat Josh Harder by about 1,300 votes point with 112,000 votes counted.\n\nHarder argued that Republican policies in Washington have hurt many residents. He emphasized that Denham voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which Harder supports.\n\nDenham, known for his involvement in water issues vital to agriculture, has proven tough to beat, despite the Democratic registration edge. He won by 3 percentage points in 2016. Representing a district with a large Hispanic population, Denham has pushed for Congress to consider a pathway for citizenship for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and stayed here illegally.", "", "Here\u2019s what to watch in the Big Ten this week:\n\nBEST GAME\n\nNo. 8 Ohio State at No. 24 Michigan State\n\nThe Buckeyes (8-1, 5-1, No. 10 CFP) aren\u2019t hitting on all cylinders but they remain in the thick of the Big Ten East race. This, and next week\u2019s trip to Maryland, are the last hurdles before their showdown with Michigan at home on Nov. 24. The Spartans (6-3, 4-2, No. 18 CFP) are playing for a best possible bowl bid and should be plenty motivated to wreck things for Ohio State after the Buckeyes hammered them 48-3 last year.\n\nBEST MATCHUP\n\nNorthwestern QB Clayton Thorson vs. Iowa defense\n\nThe Wildcats (5-4, 5-1) will be West champs if they win two of their last three, and this is the toughest one. It all comes down to Thorson, who is the Big Ten\u2019s third-leading passer after coming back from an ACL tear. Northwestern must keep Thorson upright. Iowa (6-3, 3-3) has two of the conference\u2019s top sack men in A.J.

The Buckeyes\u2019 opponent this week, Michigan State, ranks first nationally in rushing defense. The Spartans allow 71.4 yards per game and held its last two opponents to season lows on the ground. ... The 55 points against Minnesota were Illinois\u2019 most in a regulation Big Ten game since scoring 55 against Indiana in 2008. ... Nebraska\u2019s Devine Ozigbo needs 204 yards to become the school\u2019s first 1,000-yard rusher since Ameer Abdullah in 2014. ... Maryland is the only FBS team with two kickoff return touchdowns of over 95 yards (Ty Johnson vs. Michigan and Javon Leake vs. Illinois). ... Indiana S Jonathan Crawford has started all 47 games in his career, and his nine career interceptions rank eighth nationally and is tied for first in the Big Ten among active players.

Conditions don\u2019t seem right for a Wisconsin win here. But this isn\u2019t a vintage Penn State team, and it\u2019s a mystery how the Nittany Lions (6-3, 3-3, No. 20 CFP) will respond after getting demoralized in a 42-7 loss at Michigan.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nIllinois QB AJ Bush\n\nMotivation won\u2019t be a problem against Nebraska (2-7, 1-5). The graduate transfer began his college career in Lincoln, leaving after two seasons to look for playing time. He found it after stops at a junior college, Virginia Tech and now Illinois (4-5, 2-4). The 6-foot-4, 225-pound Bush is coming off his best game.

While both teams have lost two games in a row, the Longhorns could still make it to the Big 12 championship game. Texas Tech is trying to get bowl eligible in its final game on campus this season. Texas is coming off a 42-41 loss to No. 7 West Virginia, a week after the Longhorns lost 38-35 at Oklahoma State. Dual-threat quarterback Jett Duffey will likely get his second career start for Tech after freshman Alan Bowman was hospitalized for the second time this season because of a partially collapsed lung. Bowman took a shot in Texas Tech\u2019s 51-46 home loss to No. 6 Oklahoma in another primetime game in Lubbock last week.

The senior guards and off-campus roommates for No. 1 Notre Dame will always have Brooklyn, too.\n\nThe friendship between Ogunbowale, the Milwaukee scoring machine, and Mabrey, the street-wise Jersey shore kid, was cemented at the Barclays Center on April 17, 2015 in the Jordan Brand Classic\n\n\u201cWe were guarding each other,\u201d recalled Mabrey, a prep All-American from Manasquan (N.J.) High School. \u201cAnd we actually were laughing at each other because we were playing so horribly.\u201d\n\nMabrey, who had averaged 22.1 points, 6.8 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 3.0 steals in high school, had drawn the defensive assignment on Ogunbowale, a prep All-American who averaged 22.2 points, 9.6 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 2.2 steals per game at Divine Savior Holy Angels.\n\nTheir stat lines were not pretty in the game won by Mabrey\u2019s East squad, 76-75. In 20 minutes, Ogunbowale scored three points, hitting just one of eight field-goal shots. Mabrey went 0 for 8 and finished with 1 point.\n\n\u201cWe WERE bad,\u201d laughed Ogunbowale, who also was Mabrey\u2019s teammate 16 days earlier in the McDonald\u2019s All-American Classic in Chicago. Mabrey scored 12 points with six rebounds and five steals that day in winning co-most valuable player honors and Ogunbowale added nine points as their East team beat the West, 89-87.\n\nIt was the start of a beautiful relationship that only got stronger last April in Columbus in the championship game. Ogunbowale hit a 3-pointer with 0.1 seconds remaining to lift Notre Dame to a 61-58 comeback victory over Mississippi State. It came two days after Ogunbowale nailed a long jumper with a second left in overtime to knock off top-ranked Connecticut, 91-89.\n\n\u201cIce Twice\u201d they call Ogunbowale, whose two buzzer-beaters earned her the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four and whose infectious smile earned her a spot on \u201cDancing With The Stars\u201d after she concluded a remarkable junior year during which she averaged 20.8 points and earned All-America honors.\n\nMabrey earned all-Atlantic Coast Conference honors after a regular season in which she averaged 14.4 points a game after coach Muffet McGraw moved her to point guard when Mychal Johnson and Lili Thompson suffered season-ending ACL injuries. Mabrey, whose sister Michaela preceded her at Notre Dame by three seasons, was even better in the NCAA Tournament, averaging 15.8 points and 5.2 assists per game while shooting 50 percent (19 of 38) from beyond the 3-point line.\n\nThis talented backcourt is a major reason the Irish are the preseason No. 1 heading into Friday\u2019s season opener against Harvard.\n\n\u201cFrom where they started to where they are now, I\u2019ve seen great progression,\u201d McGraw said. \u201cComing off all her accomplishments last season, the biggest thing I\u2019ve seen from Arike is the leadership role she has taken. She is more vocal, especially with our freshmen. She\u2019s always encouraging them, instructing them \u2014 they are eager to listen to her.\u201d\n\nMabrey said her roommate lets her know about those famous buzzer-beaters all the time.\n\n\u201cI call her Our Lady of Arike,\u201d Mabrey quipped.\n\nBut she is grateful for Ogunbowale and how she helped bring Notre Dame its second NCAA title in McGraw\u2019s 31-year tenure in South Bend.\n\n\u201cI remember all the time we spent in the gym, her working on her shot,\u201d Mabrey said. \u201cShe had the opportunity to show how hard she worked, how much time she put in to live that moment. I was just so happy she got the opportunity to do that.\u201d\n\nOgunbowale, of course, knows there\u2019s no title if not for the sacrifice Mabrey made from moving from off guard to the point.\n\n\u201cIt told me that Marina was a team player,\u201d Ogunbowale said. \u201cThe point guard is the most important player on the floor. For Marina to give up the ball, to run plays, to learn where everyone needs to be, that was super big. She took on that role with ease.\u201d\n\nTheir personalities have rubbed off on each other.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve become more chilled hanging around her all the time,\u201d Mabrey admitted. \u201cArike has become more vocal, more aggressive. She has more of a sense of urgency now \u2014 I love it.\u201d\n\nOgunbowale and Mabrey share the same business major at Notre Dame \u2014 management consulting \u2014 and they share the housework when they are not watching television, playing cards and just relaxing. Basketball is rarely spoken or seen, though the pair did watch the Michigan State-Kansas and Kentucky-Duke men\u2019s doubleheader earlier this week with friends.\n\n\u201cWe made some buffalo dip,\u201d said Ogunbowale, who leaves the cooking to Mabrey.\n\n\u201cI usually do the cooking \u2014 she likes apple chicken sausage,\u201d Mabrey said. \u201cArike does make breakfast, and she does the dishes more than I do because the dishes are disgusting to me.\u201d\n\nBoth, of course, don\u2019t mind doing the dirty work on the basketball floor if it leads one last time to the Final Four in Tampa next April.\n\n\u201cKnowing how hard we\u2019ve worked these last three years, I\u2019m looking forward to putting it out there one more time,\u201d Mabrey said.\n\nAt least she won\u2019t have to guard her roommate.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "A woman walks past as she looks at an electronic stock board showing Japan's Nikkei 225 index at a securities firm in Tokyo Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018.

(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara)\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida added 1.4 million possible voters to the rolls when it passed Amendment 4, a measure restoring the voting rights of felons who have served their sentences. But whether those people register to vote \u2014 and which political party they ultimately support \u2014 remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cThe battle for the hearts and minds for those 1.4 million voters has officially begun,\u201d said Neil Volz of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition.\n\nHe said about a third of the 1.4 million people affected are African-American. The largest percentage of disenfranchised felons is white, he said.\n\n\u201cEvery community is impacted by this,\u201d Volz said.\n\nStudies have shown disenfranchisement tends to take more votes from Democratic candidates. Restoration of voting rights for felons in Florida has traditionally been something that Democrats have pushed for and Republicans have resisted, but in today\u2019s topsy-turvy political climate, it\u2019s unclear what will happen when felons who qualify are able to register to vote on Jan. 8.\n\n\u201cPeople speculate about the party affiliations, but it\u2019s not such a simple thing to gauge,\u201d said Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, a group that pushes for sentencing reform.\n\nHe noted that a \u201csignificant number\u201d of people who cast ballots for Republicans Rick Scott in the Senate race and Ron DeSantis in the governor\u2019s race, also voted for Amendment 4.\n\nThe issue had widespread support from groups ranging from the NAACP to the Christian Coalition and the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\n\u201cWe won a lot of independent voters and Republican voters,\u201d said Howard Simon, Florida director of the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cYou have to focus on not how many votes we got, but the breadth of support.\u201d\n\nConvicted sex offenders and those convicted of murder will not be allowed to register to vote. The measure needed 60 percent of the vote Tuesday to pass; it received 64 percent.\n\n\u201cThis was not a political vote. It was a vote of love,\u201d said Desmond Meade, president of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, the nonprofit group that organized the drive to put the amendment change on the ballot.\n\nSupporters said the state\u2019s current system was too difficult and arbitrary. It required felons to wait at least five years after completing their sentence before they could file a request with the governor and Cabinet \u2014 who then considered the requests individually.\n\nFlorida has long been considered \u201cground zero\u201d for disenfranchised felons by voting rights groups.\n\nOf the 6.1 million disenfranchised felons in the U.S., about 1.7 million live in Florida \u2014 the most of any state, Mauer said. Only 12 states disenfranchise people for a felony conviction after they\u2019ve served their sentence, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled that the people of Florida finally brought the state out of the 19th century and into the 21st century,\u201d Simon said.\n\nAfter Jan. 8, the next hurdle will be persuading folks to register to vote.\n\n\u201cThe idea that we\u2019re suddenly going to have 10 percent more registered voters by 2020 is fanciful,\u201d said Dan Smith, chair of the political science department at the University of Florida. \u201cLet\u2019s say these people do get registered to vote, then they need to turn out to vote. As we saw with the turnout yesterday, turnout was up, but it wasn\u2019t up uniformly.\u201d\n\nFor Coral Nichols, a 40-year-old from Seminole, she\u2019ll register as soon as possible. She was convicted of felony grand theft at 23, served four years in prison and completed 10 years of probation. She now co-owns a nonprofit that helps people facing charges with diversion programs.\n\n\u201cI am a changed individual. I\u2019m not that girl anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cI deserve a second chance. In 2020, I\u2019m going to get to vote.\u201d\n\nNichols said she doesn\u2019t know enough to support any particular politician, but will likely register as a Republican.", "This combination of May 20, 2018, photos shows Georgia gubernatorial candidates Stacey Abrams, left, and Brian Kemp in Atlanta. Democrats and Republicans nationwide will have to wait a bit longer to see if Georgia elects the first black woman governor in American history or doubles down on the Deep South\u2019s GOP tendencies with an acolyte of President Donald Trump (AP Photos/John Amis, File)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Republican Brian Kemp resigned Thursday as Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, removing himself from the ongoing count of the governor\u2019s election he says he\u2019s already won.\n\nKemp made his announcement in the governor\u2019s office of the Georgia Capitol, standing beside the man he plans to replace in January. Republican Gov. Nathan Deal called Kemp \u201cthe governor-elect\u201d and both said they would begin transition work together.\n\n\u201cWe won a clear and convincing victory,\u201d Kemp said of returns showing him with 50.3 percent of almost 4 million votes, about a 63,000-vote lead over Democrat Stacey Abrams. That\u2019s a narrow sum considering the near-presidential election year turnout, though sufficient for the majority required for outright victory.\n\nAbrams maintained there are enough uncounted ballots to force a December runoff in one of the marquee matchups of the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nThe Associated Press has not called the governor\u2019s race.\n\nWith legal wrangles opening on what votes to count and how, the dispute is prolonging a bitter contest awash in historical significance and national political impact. Abrams hopes to become the first black woman elected governor of any American state. Kemp seeks to maintain Republican dominance in a growing, diversifying Deep South state positioned to become a presidential battleground.\n\nThe key question is how many uncounted ballots actually remain. Kemp says it\u2019s less than 21,000 \u2014 almost certainly not enough to force a runoff. The elections chief from the secretary of state\u2019s office said in a federal court hearing Thursday afternoon that the number is 21,190.\n\n\u201cEven if she got 100 percent of those votes, we still win,\u201d Kemp told reporters.\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign argues the total could be higher, and the secretary of state\u2019s office has been scant in sharing details as officials in Georgia\u2019s 159 counties keep counting.\n\n\u201cThis is about the integrity of the election in the state of Georgia,\u201d said Abrams\u2019 campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo. \u201cBrian Kemp can\u2019t just walk away from that ... Our governor (Deal) can\u2019t just walk away from that.\u201d\n\nJohn Chandler, one of several attorneys for Abrams, promised to \u201clitigate until we have determined that every person\u2019s vote has been counted.\u201d\n\nA runoff, if needed, would be Dec. 4.\n\nCounty authorities must certify final returns by Tuesday. The state must certify a statewide result by Nov. 20. Deal appointed one of his Cabinet members to oversee the process in Kemp\u2019s place.\n\nAbrams, other Democrats \u2014 including former President Jimmy Carter \u2014 and voting rights activists had for months called for Kemp to step down amid charges he was abusing his office to make it harder for some Georgians, particularly minorities, to vote.\n\nKemp said his resignation \u201cwill give confidence to the certification process.\u201d He maintained he wasn\u2019t bowing to pressure but preparing to be governor.\n\n\u201cThat was all political,\u201d Kemp said of previous criticisms, adding Tuesday\u2019s turnout \u2014 about 1.4 million more than in Deal\u2019s last election \u2014 proves it.\n\nOne of the lawsuits heard Thursday in federal court requested Kemp be barred from overseeing the rest of the certification procedure \u2014 a requested pre-empted by Kemp\u2019s resignation.\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign said it believes she needs to pick up about 25,000 votes to force a runoff.\n\nOffering examples of potential ballots Democrats say Kemp isn\u2019t contemplating, Groh-Wargo said four counties reported considerably fewer early votes in the governor\u2019s race than the number of early ballots cast. Groh-Wargo said it seemed implausible that voters cared enough to cast ballots early but not in the hotly contested governor\u2019s race.\n\nShe added officials in suburban Atlanta\u2019s Cobb County added several hundred votes to that count Thursday morning from absentee ballots. That came after the secretary of state\u2019s office said all absentee and early ballots had been counted.\n\nAbrams\u2019 lawyers also said they planned to sue officials in Dougherty County because absentee ballots were delayed after Hurricane Michael devastated parts of south Georgia. Separately, the ACLU raised concerns over 1,200 absentee ballots in Gwinnett County, northeast of Atlanta, which it said were rejected because of missing birthdate information.\n\n\u201cBrian Kemp owes voters an explanation,\u201d Groh-Wargo said, demanding to see lists and names. \u201cWe do not believe any of these numbers are credible.\u201d\n\nWhen Kemp\u2019s campaign declared victory Wednesday, aides cited a statewide estimate of uncounted ballots from the secretary of state\u2019s office. But that office had not publicly offered a county-by-county breakdown to Abrams\u2019 campaign or the media at that point.\n\nThe provisional vote total is considerably higher than in 2016, when a slightly larger electorate yielded 16,739 provisional ballots. Of those, 7,592 were counted.\n\nState and campaign officials have said they expected a much higher proportion to be counted this year. In federal court Thursday, a secretary of state\u2019s representative said the provisional count included at least some votes cast late at a handful of metro Atlanta precincts that courts ordered to stay open past Tuesday\u2019s 7 p.m. poll closing time.\n\nKemp said he and Abrams have not communicated since the election. And while Kemp said he respected Abrams\u2019 efforts, he declared Thursday, \u201cThe votes simply are not there for her.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Barrow and Brumback on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP and https://twitter.com/KateBrumback .\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Republican U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, seeking re-election in the 2nd Congressional District, greets supporters at his election night party, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Bangor, Maine. (Gabor Degre/The Bangor Daily News via AP)\n\nPORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 Maine embarked on a voting experiment on Election Day.\n\nInstead of selecting a single winner, voters were asked to rank all of the candidates from best to worst on the ballot in a new way of voting approved by state voters.\n\nThe election marked the first time what is known as ranked-choice voting was used in U.S. House and Senate races.\n\nThe system is used for municipal races in about a dozen cities. But Mainers took it a step further, approving it use in statewide primary elections and federal races in general elections.\n\n___\n\nWHY IS MAINE USING RANKED CHOICE VOTING?\n\nThe history of ranked-choice voting in Maine dates to 2001, when a lawmaker introduced a bill to create it.\n\nThe idea gained support \u2014 with the largest city, Portland, adopting the system for mayoral races in 2010 \u2014 but it was unsuccessful statewide until 2016, when Maine voters OK\u2019d the system by ballot referendum.\n\nNine of the past 11 gubernatorial elections had resulted in winners who failed to get a majority of the vote. Electoral reform group Fair Vote and the Texas-based nonprofit Action Now Initiative have provided hundreds of thousands of dollars to bring ranked-choice voting to Maine.\n\nIn May 2017, Maine\u2019s high court advised that parts of the ranked-choice voting law are unconstitutional when it comes to state general elections. Supporters pressed to use the system in primaries and federal races.\n\nLawmakers tried to block the rollout by requiring a constitutional amendment by December 2021, but voters approved a second statewide referendum nullifying the legislative delay.\n\n___\n\nHOW DOES THIS SYSTEM WORK?\n\nVoters rank candidates from first to last on their ballot, and the election is over if one candidate wins a majority of first-place votes. If not, candidates are eliminated one by one and their votes reallocated in what amounts to a mathematical game of survival.\n\nThe eventual winner might not be the candidate who had the most first-place votes, but rather the one who tallies the highest number of second- or even third-place votes.\n\nVoters can also simply fill in one oval with their first-choice candidate. Or they can fill in multiple ovals to rank all of the candidates.\n\n___\n\nWHEN WILL MAINE KNOW ITS RANKED WINNERS?\n\nIt could take some time in the 2nd Congressional District, the most expensive race in state history and the only one for which neither candidate collected a majority.\n\nDemocratic Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap said the results of additional rounds of ranked-choice tabulations won\u2019t be known until sometime next week.\n\nDunlap said a courier service has been contracted to begin retrieving the results from town clerks on Thursday. The office isn\u2019t committing to a day in which the unofficial voting outcome will be announced but said it will likely be next week.\n\n___\n\nWHAT ARE THE BENEFITS?\n\nAdvocates say it helps promote civility, end election spoilers and ensure the eventual winner receives majority support.\n\nSupporters also say the system avoids the cost of a separate runoff election and encourages collaboration among candidates.\n\nSome proponents have pointed to Republican Gov. Paul LePage\u2019s election in 2010 with 38.1 percent of votes in a five-way race.\n\n___\n\nWHAT ARE THE DRAWBACKS?\n\nCritics say ranked-choice is confusing and leads to bland campaigns in which candidates steer clear of contentious topics because they don\u2019t want to alienate any voters.\n\nJason McDaniel, associate political science professor at San Francisco State University, says his research shows ranked-choice voting increases the rate of ballot errors and disqualifies ballots, particularly among lower-income residents.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer David Sharp contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Stephan Savoia, Pool, File)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 A legal principle that erased former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez\u2019s murder conviction after he killed himself in prison is outdated, unfair and should not stand, a Massachusetts prosecutor told the state\u2019s highest court Thursday.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense the former New England Patriots tight end is now innocent in the eyes of the law just because he died before his appeal could be heard, Bristol County District Attorney Thomas Quinn III said. Quinn is urging the court to reinstate Hernandez\u2019s conviction and do away with the legal principle for future cases.\n\n\u201cHe goes through a full trial, a jury who speaks for the public convicts him and because he dies, in this case commits suicide, the whole thing is wiped out like it never happened? It\u2019s not fair or just and should be changed,\u201d Quinn told reporters after the hearing.\n\nHernandez was found guilty in 2015 of killing semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd. Two years later, the 27-year-old was found dead in his prison cell days after being acquitted of most charges in a separate double-murder case.\n\nA judge threw out Hernandez\u2019s conviction last year, citing the legal principle that holds that a defendant convicted at trial who dies before an appeal is heard should no longer be considered guilty in the eyes of the law, thereby returning the case to its pretrial status.\n\nLegal experts say the doctrine, rooted in centuries of English law, requires a conviction not be considered final until an appeal can determine whether mistakes were made that deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\n\nJohn Thompson, Hernandez\u2019s appellate attorney, told the Supreme Judicial Court that there\u2019s nothing wrong with the doctrine and that the alternatives floated by Quinn are problematic.\n\n\u201cThe jury\u2019s decision is not the end-all be-all,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt is an opinion arrived at by 12 people followed by a process that is subject to defect.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Judicial Court typically takes several months to issue a decision.\n\nHow other states handle cases such as Hernandez\u2019s varies widely. Some states, like Massachusetts, toss the convictions, while others dismiss the defendant\u2019s appeal and the conviction stands. Other states allow appellate courts to consider a dead defendant\u2019s case, prosecutors say.\n\nQuinn wants court to allow a defendant\u2019s estate to pursue an appeal, if they wish, otherwise the verdict would stand.\n\nSeveral justices appeared interested in an approach crafted by the Alabama Supreme Court, which directed the state simply to note in the court record the conviction was neither affirmed nor reversed because the defendant died while the appeal was pending.\n\nBut others seemed puzzled over what to do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m struggling with this because we don\u2019t have any good options,\u201d said Ralph Gants, chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.\n\nQuinn pointed to other high-profile Massachusetts criminals who had their convictions erased after their death, including John Salvi, who was convicted of killing two abortion clinic workers and wounding five other people during a shooting rampage in Brookline in 1994.\n\nRoman Catholic priest John Geoghan, a key figure in the clergy sex abuse scandal that rocked the Boston archdiocese and spread across the globe, also had his child molestation conviction vacated after he was beaten to death in 2003 in his cell at the same Massachusetts maximum-security prison where Hernandez died.\n\n___\n\nFollow Alanna Durkin Richer on Twitter at http://twitter.com/aedurkinricher .", "In this Oct 26, 2018 photo, the skeleton of a horse called Miss Congeniality lies in the corner pasture of the sprawling campus at the Central University of Venezuela in Maracay, in Venezuela.Thieves overnight had hopped the fence, slaughtered the beloved horse and made off with her meat either to sell or feed their hungry families.

They say she was smart and even trotted up when you called her name.\n\nTo his shock, Toro discovered the horse\u2019s skin and dismembered bones hidden among trees in the corner pasture of the sprawling campus in the central Venezuelan city of Maracay. Thieves overnight had hopped the fence, slaughtered the horse and made off with her meat \u2014 either to sell or to feed their hungry families.\n\n\u201cI burst into tears,\u201d said Toro, who delivered the grim news to other students. \u201cWe came here, and together we all cried.\u201d\n\nThe slaughter isn\u2019t an isolated incident.

There are media reports of small groups of men caught smuggling stolen horse meat \u2014 accompanied by gory pictures of dismembered horses.\n\nProfessors on campus at Central University of Venezuela in Maracay complain that thieves have walked off with air conditioners and electrical wires, forcing them to teach in dark classrooms with sweat running down their backs.\n\nBut in a new low, bandits have turned their attention to slaughtering horses and cattle vital to training the South American nation\u2019s next generation of veterinarians.\n\nThe meat from a full-grown horse could fetch roughly $1,400 at market, based on the equivalent prices of Venezuelan beef, making it a lucrative venture in a country where a worker\u2019s monthly minimum wage is under $10 at the widely-used black market rate.\n\nMonths before Miss Congeniality\u2019s demise, crooks slaughtered two horses donated to the university and that were temporarily quarantined at a nearby pasture, Toro said. Since late 2016, seven cows \u2014 including a prized bull at the center of the school\u2019s breeding program \u2014 have fallen prey to overnight bandits sneaking onto campus.\n\n\u201cA loss like that is pretty expensive,\u201d said professor Daniel Vargas, who oversees the university\u2019s cattle program.\n\nVenezuelans have traditionally been repulsed by the thought of eating horse meat, making recent developments here especially puzzling, say professors, who suspect customers are buying horse meat at their local butcher thinking it is beef.\n\nThe faculty reports each case, but police have yet to arrest any suspects. The school\u2019s budget has been frozen for over a decade, leading security guards to walk off the job and leave the campus an open target, university officials said.\n\n\u201cIt could be an inside job, or someone from outside,\u201d said Isis Vivas, dean of the veterinary school. \u201cAnything is possible.\u201d\n\nToro, a lifelong animal lover who plans to graduate next year, believes Miss Congeniality was singled out from the small heard of five horses.

Thompson embraces challenges, having worked hard for every accolade that has come her way.\n\nA two-time Olympic gold medalist, Thompson was the third-option \u2014 albeit arguably the best third option ever in the women\u2019s game \u2014 playing alongside Cynthia Cooper and Sheryl Swoopes during the Houston Comets WNBA championship run. She scored more than 1,500 points and had more than 1,000 rebounds at Morningside High School in Inglewood, California, before heading to USC \u2014 though she never quite stepped out of shadows of another Morningside and USC player before her: Lisa Leslie.\n\nThompson just continued to play her game, eventually becoming the No. 1 pick in the 1997 WNBA draft after averaging a double-double at USC.\n\nNow 43, Thompson wants to make Virginia a championship contender again \u2014 with the Cavaliers playing their game.\n\nWhich Thompson stresses will be up-tempo.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still going to be a defensive team,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s something that we talk about daily but we need to score more so encouraging our team to be offensive-minded is something that I\u2019ve done from Day One. I mean, we have to score points.\n\n\u201cDefense, for sure, wins championships, but it takes some points here and there to actually kind of secure those wins. Confidence in shooting the ball ... being comfortable and free-flowing and scoring the basketball, is very important. That is definitely a point of emphasis for us.\u201d\n\nVirginia finished 19-14 last season and reached the NCAA Tournament for the first time in nine seasons. The Cavaliers held opponents to 61.2 points per game. But they scored just 62.1 points per contest, and that\u2019s not enough for Thompson.\n\nThe core includes guard Dominique Toussaint, the leading returning scorer (11.4 ppg), forward Jocelyn Willoughby, who was No. 3 at 9.6 ppg, and 6-foot-9 center Felicia Aiyeotan, who scored 7.4 ppg, grabbed 6.9 rebounds per game and led the Atlantic Coast Conference with 69 blocked shots.\n\nThompson is not thinking about rebuilding, not with that trio of juniors.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re just contributing to a pretty solid foundation,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to rebuild when you have a core like that.

This is the foundation of what is Virginia.\u201d\n\nThompson, hired when a family matter caused Joanne Boyle to retire after last season, took over a program with a history of success. The Cavaliers went to the NCAA Tournament 20 consecutive seasons from 1983-2002 under Debbie Ryan, reached three Final Fours and lost 70-67 to the Lady Vols in overtime in the 1990-91 championship game.\n\nThompson spent the last three seasons as an assistant coach at Texas, and her impressive resume made her hiring an easy decision for Virginia athletic director Carla Williams, who also has a background in women\u2019s basketball. Williams played four seasons at Georgia and then worked as an assistant coach and top recruiter before altering her career path to get into the administrative side.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s important is to have a person like Tina who has been there and done that,\u201d Williams said. \u201cShe is a living testament to championships and enthusiasm and winning. I just think that is a bonus. I think she\u2019ll be a great coach. I think she\u2019ll be a great recruiter and I think our players already adore her.\u201d\n\nAt Texas, one of Thompson\u2019s responsibilities was working with the Longhorns\u2019 post players, and the presence of Aiyeotan makes her arrival all the more intriguing. The native of Nigeria is the tallest player in the women\u2019s game, according to Virginia, but is still relatively new to basketball.\n\nAiyeotan has embraced how the 6-2 Thompson played the game.\n\n\u201cI told them that I didn\u2019t have the fanciest game and didn\u2019t look good, but it was not something that I ever worried about,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI paid more attention to and was more conscious of my efficiency. Not taking bad shots. Taking the shot I made more times than not, and it wasn\u2019t an around the back, behind the basket finger-roll.\u201d\n\nAiyeotan, who rushed and missed many shots from in close last season, has taken the advice from \u201cCoach Tina\u201d to heart.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really good for you to focus on the finishing,\u201d Aiyeotan said. \u201cThat\u2019s what counts on the scoreboard and I think the more consistent you are, the more confident you get.\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have to wait to show how much she has learned.

(AP Photo/Bruce Kluckhohn, File)\n\nIt\u2019s never been easier to score in the NFL.\n\nAt the midpoint of the season, the league is on pace to set records for most points, touchdowns and touchdown passes in a single season. Teams have scored 6,440 points, 736 touchdowns and 473 TDs in the air through Week 9.\n\nThe increase in offensive production follows the lowest-scoring season this decade. Teams averaged 21.7 points per game in 2017. That\u2019s up to 24 points this season. A total of 12 teams are averaging at least 27.5 points per game led by the Chiefs (36.3), Saints (34.9) and Rams (33.2).\n\nThere are several reasons scoring has soared. A combination of new rules and rule adjustments over the past few years favor offenses. The league has banned helmet-to-helmet contact, implemented a defenseless receiver rule and a body-weight rule against players making sacks, outlawed low hits on quarterbacks and emphasized illegal contact penalties.\n\nThere\u2019s also been an influx of innovative, offensive-minded coaches \u2014 Sean McVay, Doug Pederson, Kyle Shanahan \u2014 and talented young quarterbacks \u2014 Patrick Mahomes, Carson Wentz, Jared Goff, among others.\n\nFive quarterbacks \u2014 Mahomes, Goff, Matt Ryan, Ben Roethlisberger and Aaron Rodgers \u2014 are on pace to throw for 5,000 yards. That only happened nine times previously in league history. Ten QBs have a passer rating over 100, double the total last season.\n\nGames are not only featuring more scoring but there\u2019s been plenty of close, down-to-the-wire action. Seventy-one games were decided by one score, eight points or less. That\u2019s the fifth-most through nine weeks. Thirty-seven games have been decided by a field goal, which was fourth-most at this point. Ten games have reached overtime and 36 teams have rallied to win or tie after trailing in the fourth quarter or overtime.\n\nClose, high-scoring games are exciting for fans, especially the millions who spend billions of dollars to play fantasy football. All of it is good for the league\u2019s television ratings, which are up after declining in 2016 and 2017.\n\nMore folks are also watching by live streaming. According to a recent study from Conviva, a real-time measurement platform, NFL live viewing was up 72 percent in plays and 83 percent in viewing hours over the same time frame last year.\n\nConviva\u2019s data shows mobile NFL plays were up 95 percent and prime-time NFL saw 109 percent growth in plays and 97 percent growth in viewing hours.\n\nHere\u2019s a look inside the numbers from the first half:\n\nPASSING KING: Drew Brees broke Peyton Manning\u2019s record for career passing yards last month. Brees has 72,781 yards passing and counting. Manning had 71,940.\n\nKICKING KING: Adam Vinatieri broke Morten Anderson\u2019s record for most points and most field goals. Vinatieri has 2,550 points and 573 field goals. Anderson had 2,544 points and 565 field goals.\n\nTHE 500 CLUB: Brees and Tom Brady joined Manning and Brett Favre as the only players to throw 500 TD passes. Brees has 506, one more than Brady. Manning had 539 and Favre had 508.\n\nPATRICK THE GREAT: Mahomes has 29 TD passes and 3,185 yards passing yards, the most in both categories through the first 10 games of a player\u2019s career. He also has thrown for at least 300 yards in eight straight games, one away from setting the record he currently shares with Andrew Luck.\n\nTHIELEN\u2019S CHASE: Adam Thielen became the first player to have eight 100-yard receiving games to start a season, tying Calvin Johnson for the longest streak of such games. The former undrafted wide receiver has 78 catches for the Vikings. He\u2019s on pace to challenge Marvin Harrison\u2019s single-season record of 143.\n\nGURLEY GETS IN: Todd Gurley has 16 touchdowns \u2014 12 rushing and four receiving \u2014 for the Rams. He\u2019s on pace for 28. The record is 31 by Hall of Famer LaDainian Tomlinson.\n\nKIRK COMPLETIONS: Kirk Cousins became the first player to complete at least 30 passes in four consecutive games. Before the season, Cousins became the first player to sign a fully guaranteed contract when the Vikings gave him $84 million for three seasons.\n\nFIRST MISS: Justin Tucker had made all 222 extra points in his career before he missed one at the end of Baltimore\u2019s 24-23 loss to New Orleans in Week 7. He hadn\u2019t missed any kick 33 yards or shorter in 300 tries his career.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "", "", "", "Pittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby (87) skates by as members of the Washington Capitals including left wing Alex Ovechkin (8), of Russia, and center Evgeny Kuznetsov (92), of Russia, celebrate a goal by right wing T.J.

(AP Photo/K.M. Chaudary)\n\nISLAMABAD (AP) \u2014 A week after Pakistan\u2019s Supreme Court acquitted her of blasphemy, a Christian woman who had been on death row for eight years was freed from detention Thursday, but her whereabouts are a closely guarded secret following demands by extremists that she be hanged in public.\n\nThe case of Aasia Bibi has become a political minefield for Prime Minister Imran Khan. He is trying to placate the Muslim extremists who have threatened to topple his government, while keeping the 54-year-old mother of five safe from a lynch mob and also finding a way to allow her to leave Pakistan without bringing rioters into the streets.\n\nBibi has been offered asylum by the European Parliament, which championed her case after she was convicted in 2010 under Pakistan\u2019s harsh blasphemy law. There has been sharp worldwide criticism of the law, which remains popular in the Muslim majority country and carries the death penalty for insulting Islam but also has been used as a way to settle scores and pressure minorities.\n\nBibi was with her family under heavy security after being transferred to the Pakistani capital overnight from her detention facility in southern Punjab, triggering expectations of an imminent departure from the country.\n\nFor the moment, Bibi remained in Pakistan, according to two people close to her who spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to endanger her. That was confirmed later Thursday by Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry.\n\nFollowing her Oct. 31 acquittal by Pakistan\u2019s Supreme Court, the hard-line Tehreek-e-Labbaik Party forced a nationwide shutdown as its supporters filled the streets for three days to protest the ruling. The rallies only dispersed after Khan\u2019s government promised that a court would review a motion to challenge the acquittal and deny Bibi permission to leave Pakistan.\n\nKhan, who came to power after elections last summer in part on an Islamist agenda, was immediately accused by critics of giving in to the extremists.\n\nBibi\u2019s release, high-security transfer to Islamabad and her likely departure raised the possibility that Khan\u2019s promises to the Islamists could have been an effort to buy time. The government, however, has not openly declared that Bibi was free to leave.\n\nTehreek-e-Labbaik, in a video message that was circulated widely Thursday, said it received government assurances following Bibi\u2019s relocation to Islamabad that she wouldn\u2019t leave the country until the review petition was heard.\n\nKhan, a former cricket star and playboy who has embraced religious conservatism before he ran for prime minister, is hamstrung by contradictions within his own government, according to Zahid Hussain, who has written two books on the rise of militancy in Pakistan.\n\n\u201cThere are some within the party, senior members of the party, who are pampering religious extremists for the sake of votes, and some believe in the same kind of world view,\u201d Hussain said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nBibi\u2019s ordeal began on a blistering hot day in 2009 when she went to fetch water for herself and fellow farmworkers. An argument took place after two women refused to drink from the same container as Bibi, who is Roman Catholic.\n\nThe two women later said Bibi had insulted the Prophet Muhammad, and she was charged with blasphemy. She was put on trial, convicted and sentenced to death in 2010.\n\nWhile her conviction was appealed, her case gained worldwide attention and focused international criticism on the blasphemy law. In announcing her acquittal last week, a three-judge panel of the Supreme Court upheld the law itself but said prosecutors had failed to prove Bibi had violated it.\n\nEuropean Parliament President Antonio Tajani invited Bibi and her family to Europe. In a letter, a copy of which was seen by the AP, Tajani told Bibi\u2019s husband Ashiq Masih that the parliament is \u201cextremely concerned for your safety as well as your family\u2019s, due to the violence by extremist elements in Pakistan.\u201d\n\nThe letter added to expectations that she and her family would leave for Europe, though their destination has not been confirmed. Spain and France have offered her asylum.\n\nSpeaking to the AP earlier this week in the Punjab capital of Lahore, Masih said he hasn\u2019t slept much since his wife\u2019s acquittal and the subsequent outrage by extremists. His initial joy quickly turned to sadness when he realized the ordeal was not over.\n\nHe said that he is consumed by fear every time his phone rings and haunted by the shouts of \u201cHang her!\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I pace on the rooftop, sometimes I walk on the road outside our home,\u201d he said. \u201cI look at the faces around me and I wonder if anyone is waiting to hurt us.\u201d\n\nEven the mere suggestion of blasphemy can whip mobs into a lynching frenzy in Pakistan. In 2011, the governor of Punjab province was killed by his own guard after he defended Bibi and criticized the blasphemy law. A year later, Shahbaz Bhatti, the minister for minorities and a Christian, was shot and killed.\n\nFor Bibi\u2019s husband, leaving Pakistan is painful but remains a matter of life and death.\n\n\u201cWe have no other choice but to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cI love Pakistan but I can\u2019t live here.\u201d\n\nEven in Bibi\u2019s home village of Aitta Wali \u2014 an impoverished farming community where animals and residents share tiny, sunbaked mud houses \u2014 there is still outrage over her acquittal, and its remaining three Christian families have fled.\n\n\u201cOur entire village swore on the Quran that she insulted the prophet but no one believes us and everyone believes her,\u201d said Aman Ali, one of the villagers. \u201cBefore this, we liked the Christian families. We always got along. But now there is only anger.\u201d\n\nSome of that anger was directed at a visiting AP reporter, who was told by one resident: \u201cGo. Just get out. Go.\u201d\n\nMuhammad Afzal Qadri, a leader in the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Party and a religious scholar, said he doesn\u2019t regret calling for the deaths of the three judges who acquitted Bibi, or for calling on his followers to overthrow Khan\u2019s government.\n\nAt his sprawling madrassa in the Punjab city of Gujrat, Qadri told the AP this week that he had the religious authority to declare a fatwa, or edict, demanding the judges be killed.\n\nPakistan is bound by Islamic injunctions, he said, adding that he was qualified to decide such matters. The West only seeks to undermine Pakistan\u2019s Islamic traditions and culture, Qadri said.\n\nHussain, the author on Pakistani militancy, said the demonstrations over Bibi\u2019s acquittal were an attempt to regain positions the extremists had lost in the July elections.\n\nAnother rally Thursday in the southern city of Karachi drew thousands. One religious leader, Fazlur Rehman, whose party was routed in the elections, said the \u201ccourt of the masses\u201d has rejected Bibi\u2019s acquittal.\n\nThe Tehreek-e-Taliban insurgent group warned anyone who would commit blasphemy that \u201cour daggers will cut your throat.\u201d\n\nHussain said the extremists \u201care trying to mobilize people on this issue, creating more extremism. They have created a sense of fear in society, for anyone who disagrees with their view of Islam.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Munir Ahmed in Islamabad, Asim Tanvir in Multan, Pakistan, Mohammad Farooq in Karachi, Pakistan, and Ishtiaq Mahsud, in Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan, contributed.", "Anaheim Ducks goaltender Ryan Miller (30) and defenseman Jacob Larsson (32) celebrate the team's 3-2 win over the Calgary Flames in an NHL hockey game Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018, in Anaheim, Calif.

Anaheim lost to Los Angeles 4-1 on Tuesday, but Getzlaf said it was good to get back on the ice quickly and put that defeat behind them.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy, though. Anaheim led 2-0 in the first but Calgary rallied to tie it six minutes into the third when Mark Jankowski stole the puck from Brandon Montour in the neutral zone and shot it just over Ryan Miller\u2019s glove while leading a 2-on-1 rush.\n\nThe Ducks, though, were quickly able to seize back momentum. Getzlaf corralled a loose puck in front and directed a backhand through Mike Smith\u2019s legs to snap the Flames\u2019 four-game winning streak.\n\n\u201cIn the end we gutted it out in the third period and found a way,\u201d Anaheim coach Randy Carlyle said. \u201cI thought we started the right way.

Smith stopped 21 shots.\n\nThe Ducks got on the board at 8:37 of the first when Silfverberg carried the puck into the Calgary zone and ripped a slap shot for his fifth goal of the season.

Trump has threatened to expand U.S. penalties to all goods from China.\n\nChina\u2019s global exports rose 12.6 percent to $217.3 billion in October, down from September\u2019s 14.5 percent growth. Imports rose 20.3 percent to $183.3 billion, accelerating from the previous month\u2019s 14.3 percent. The global trade surplus was $34 billion, up from September\u2019s $31.7 billion.\n\n\u201cWhile shipments to the U.S. held up well, those to other parts of the world grew even faster, suggesting that global demand is more resilient than expected,\u201d Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics said in a report.\n\nUnexpectedly strong imports contrasted with other signs that China\u2019s factory output and other economic activity is cooling.\n\nIn the quarter ending in September, economic growth slowed to 6.5 percent over a year earlier, down from the previous quarter\u2019s 6.7 percent. A government survey found factory activity in October fell to a two-year low.\n\nChinese leaders have cut tariffs on non-U.S. goods and promised to encourage imports of consumer goods but reject pressure to roll back plans for state-led development of technology industries.\n\nWashington, Europe and other trading partners complain plans such as \u201cMade in China 2025,\u201d which calls for creating Chinese global champions in artificial intelligence, robotics and other fields, violate Beijing\u2019s market-opening obligations.\n\nXi presided over the opening of an import fair Monday in Shanghai that is meant to rebrand China as a welcoming market for other countries\u2019 goods. Some 3,600 companies from 152 countries are taking part in the five-day event.\n\nThe president promised to open Chinese markets wider, to cut costs for importers and to increase consumer spending power. But he gave no response to foreign complaints about technology policy and investment barriers.\n\nBeijing agreed in May to narrow its trade gap with the United States by purchasing more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports. But Chinese leaders scrapped that deal after Trump\u2019s first tariff hikes hit.\n\nChinese companies have been ordered to stop buying American soybeans \u2014 the biggest U.S. export to China \u2014 and find other suppliers and export markets.\n\nChina\u2019s exports to the 28-nation European Union in October rose 12 percent over a year ago to $35 billion. Imports of European goods increased 14.1 percent to $21.6 billion.\n\nAmerican demand for Chinese goods should weaken next year as tariff hikes bite, said ING\u2019s Pang. She said exporters might try to sell more to Europe or other Asian economies, but those markets also might be hurt by U.S. import controls.\n\n\u201cStrong export growth may not last very long,\u201d said Pang. \u201cWe are not particularly optimistic on China export growth in 2019.\u201d", "Minnesota Timberwolves center Karl-Anthony Towns, left, shoots as Los Angeles Lakers center Tyson Chandler defends during the first half of an NBA basketball game Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Tyson Chandler savored the ovations when he first took the court in downtown Los Angeles. The cheers at the end were even sweeter.\n\nThe Lakers\u2019 newest big man got to represent his hometown Wednesday night for the first time in his 18 NBA seasons, and he came up bigger and better than even he expected in a hard-fought win.\n\nLeBron James had 24 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists, and Kyle Kuzma scored six of his 21 points in the final minutes of the Lakers\u2019 114-110 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nJames, Kuzma and Josh Hart played major roles in the Lakers\u2019 third win in four games, but they all directed praise toward Chandler, who joined the Lakers on Tuesday after reaching a buyout agreement with Phoenix. After LA\u2019s savvy basketball fans welcomed Chandler to town with cheers, the veteran provided much of what the Lakers have been lacking this season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s honestly all love,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cI love this city the way they love me. When you\u2019re homegrown from here and going to high school and all that and you\u2019ve had these same fans, and now you represent the jersey that everybody has been cheering for their entire lives, you kind of become one. I\u2019ve been on the other side and played the villain. Now it\u2019s great to be on this side and actually rep them.\u201d\n\nWith only a cursory knowledge of the Lakers\u2019 plays and schemes, Chandler still provided defense, rebounding and hard picks while playing a surprising 23 minutes.\n\nChandler\u2019s nine rebounds included two enormous offensive boards in the last minute. He then contested Derrick Rose\u2019s final 3-point attempt, forcing a miss that essentially sealed the win.\n\n\u201cYou can tell he\u2019s a young-old guy that\u2019s happy to be back home, and he played with a lot of energy tonight,\u201d said Rajon Rondo, who was thanked by Chandler for vocally directing him around the court.\n\nHart scored 21 points and Brandon Ingram added 20 for the Lakers, who avenged a loss at Minnesota nine days earlier with a tenacious finish at Staples Center.\n\nKuzma\u2019s fourth 3-pointer put the Lakers up 111-104 with 1:51 to play, but Rose promptly hit back-to-back 3-pointers for the Wolves. After Chandler twice extended the Lakers\u2019 ensuing possession, Kuzma hit one of two free throws with 9.5 seconds left.\n\nRose then missed his last 3 under heavy defensive pressure from Chandler, and Hart hit two free throws to seal it. Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau thought Rose deserved a foul.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to give me that call,\u201d Rose said with a shrug. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been giving me that call, so I\u2019ve just got to get used to it.\u201d\n\nRose scored 31 points and Jimmy Butler added 24 for the Timberwolves, who dropped to 0-7 on the road this season with their fourth consecutive loss overall. Minnesota had won five straight over the Lakers.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nTimberwolves: Butler converted a four-point play to tie it at 94 with 7:44 to play. ... Thibodeau used the same starting lineup from Monday\u2019s loss to the Clippers.\n\nLakers: James fell just shy of his 75th triple-double, but scored nine points in the fourth quarter. ... Chandler grew up in several parts of California before moving to Compton, where he starred at Dominguez High School and became the No. 2 pick in the 2001 NBA draft. ... Chandler backed up JaVale McGee, who had 16 points on 8-of-10 shooting.\n\nGOOD STARTS\n\nMinnesota came out in an offensive groove during its second straight game at Staples Center following Monday\u2019s loss to the Clippers. All five Wolves starters reached double figures in the first half while hitting 66 percent of their shots. Rose and Wiggins hit three 3-pointers apiece and all five starters contributed to an 11-for-17 performance beyond the arc, tying the franchise record for 3s in a first half.\n\nBut the Lakers didn\u2019t get humiliated in the first quarter, as they did last Sunday in their loss to Toronto. Hart hit four 3-pointers in the first half, and Kuzma hit a buzzer-beating 3 to limit Minnesota\u2019s lead to 67-65.\n\nBAD BOARDS\n\nMinnesota was outrebounded 47-40, and it was most glaring in that final minute. \u201cVery, very frustrating to know we were that close, and all we have to do is rebound the basketball,\u201d Butler said. \u201cBut that\u2019s been the story for us so far. We\u2019ve been right there. We\u2019ve been outrebounded. We have to figure out a way to go get the ball.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTimberwolves: At the Sacramento Kings on Friday night.\n\nLakers: At the Sacramento Kings on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: www.apnews.com/NBA and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports", "S Carolina firm owner accused of not paying $332K in taxes\n\nGREER, S.C.

Members of the caravan which has stopped in Mexico City demanded buses Thursday to take them to the U.S. border, saying it is too cold and dangerous to continue walking and hitchhiking.(AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Central American migrants in a caravan that has stopped in Mexico City demanded buses Thursday to take them to the U.S. border, saying it is too cold and dangerous to continue walking and hitchhiking.\n\nAbout 200 migrants, representing the roughly 5,000 staying in a stadium in the south of Mexico\u2019s capital, marched to the United Nations office in Mexico City to make the demand for transportation.\n\nThe office was closed when the migrants arrived, but a dozen were received by U.N. representatives at a nearby location, said Ilberto Sosa Montes, a 45-year-old Honduran who is one of caravan\u2019s coordinators.\n\n\u201cWe need buses to continue traveling,\u201d said Milton Benitez, a caravan coordinator. Benitez noted that it would be colder in northern Mexico and it wasn\u2019t safe for the migrants to continue along highways, where drug cartels frequently operate.\n\n\u201cThis is a humanitarian crisis and they are ignoring it,\u201d Benitez said as the group arrived at the U.N. office.\n\nThe plan was that when the migrant delegation returned to the stadium, roughly a three-hour walk from the U.N. office, the migrants would gather in an assembly to decide when they would leave Mexico City and what route they would take to the U.S. border. But the meeting with U.N. officials was continuing into the evening Thursday, representatives of the U.N. and the caravan confirmed.\n\nMexico City authorities say that of the 4,841 registered migrants receiving shelter in a sports complex, 1,726 are under the age of 18, including 310 children under five.\n\nThe Mexican government has said most of the migrants have refused offers to stay in Mexico, and only a small number have agreed to return to their home countries. About 85 percent of the migrants are from Honduras, while others are from the Central American countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is the longest route but is the best border, while Texas is the closest but the worst\u201d border, said Jose Luis Fuentes of the National Lawyers Guild to gathered migrants.\n\nThere have already been reports of migrants on the caravan going missing, though that is often because they hitch rides on trucks that turn off on different routes, leaving them lost.\n\nHowever, the U.N. human rights agency said its office in Mexico had filed a report with prosecutors in the central state of Puebla about two buses that migrants boarded in the last leg of the trip to Mexico City early this week, and whose whereabouts are not known.\n\nMexico City is itself more than 600 miles from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas, and a previous caravan in the spring opted for a much longer route to Tijuana in the far northwest, across from San Diego. That caravan steadily dwindled to only about 200 people by the time it reached the border.\n\nActivists and officials explained the options available to migrants in Mexico, which has offered them refuge, asylum or work visas. The government said 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them while they wait for the 45-day application process for a more permanent status.\n\nThursday\u2019s meeting with U.N. representatives comes two days after U.S. midterm elections in which President Donald Trump had converted the migrants into a campaign issue, portraying them as a major threat.\n\nMarlon Ivan Mendez, a farm worker from Copan, Honduras, was waiting in line for donated shoes to replace the worn crocs he has used since leaving his country three weeks ago. He said he left because gangs were charging him rent to live in his own home.\n\n\u201cIt is not fair that the good ones pay for the sinners,\u201d Mendez said of fears that gang members are coming with the caravan.\n\nChristopher Gascon, the Mexico representative for the International Organization for Migration, estimated there are perhaps another 4,000 in caravans that are working their way through southern Mexico.\n\nBut some migrants had been visiting the organization\u2019s tent asking about how they can return home.\n\nOn Wednesday night, a bus left from Mexico City to return 37 people to their countries of origin.\n\nIn the stadium, hundreds of Mexico City employees and even more volunteers helped sort donations and direct migrants toward food, water, diapers and other basics. Migrants searched through piles of clothes and grabbed boxes of milk for children.\n\nDarwin Pereira, a 23-year-old construction worker from Olanchito, Honduras, left his country with his wife and son, 4, for the very simple reason that \u201cthere is no work there.\u201d\n\nPereira, who still wears the same cheap plastic sandals he left Honduras with a month ago, thought about what he would do if he met the U.S. president.\n\n\u201cIf I meet Donald Trump, I am going to cry.

Dauenhauer, who tore down fliers from bulletin boards and removed fliers from bins in a courtyard behind the mosque in Tempe, is scheduled to be sentenced Thursday, Nov. 8 for her criminal damage conviction. (Tempe Police Department via AP, File)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 A woman who was captured on video making derogatory comments about Muslims as she tore down fliers posted at an Arizona mosque was sentenced Thursday to 18 months of probation for her aggravated criminal damage conviction.\n\nElizabeth Ann Dauenhauer of Phoenix was with a friend and three children in March when Dauenhauer took down announcements on bulletin boards and removed pamphlets from bins in a fenced-in courtyard behind the mosque in Tempe. Qurans also were taken, but it\u2019s unclear which of the two women was accused of walking away with them.\n\nThe two women, known for making anti-Muslim statements at political events in the Phoenix area, walked past a no-trespassing sign posted on a gate to the courtyard, where only members of the mosque were allowed to go without permission.\n\nDauenhauer, who also was ordered to complete 200 hours of community service, expressed remorse for her actions.\n\n\u201cI am very sorry for the people I hurt,\u201d said Dauenhauer, who will have to serve one month in jail if it\u2019s determined that she hasn\u2019t followed the rules of probation.\n\nA burglary charge stemming from the visit to the mosque was dismissed against Dauenhauer as part of her earlier agreement to plead guilty to aggravated criminal damage. Her sentence mirrored the punishments called for in her plea deal.\n\nDauenhauer, 52, faced fewer criminal charges than 32-year-old Tahnee Savanna Gonzales, who joined her at the mosque and posted video of the visit on her social media account. The video shows Gonzales starting a shouting match with a Muslim man after he walked out of the mosque and tried to pet her dog.\n\nGonzales has pleaded not guilty to burglary, aggravated criminal damage and other charges. Her trial is set for Jan. 10.\n\nLawyers for Gonzales contend her comments were protected by the First Amendment. They say the mosque is open to the public and intended for people to take the materials that Gonzales and Dauenhauer walked away with.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working on trying to achieve a positive result in this case,\u201d Marc Victor, one of Gonzales\u2019 lawyers, said in an email to The Associated Press.\n\nGonzales\u2019 attorneys didn\u2019t immediately return a call Thursday seeking comment on the case.\n\nIn the video, Dauenhauer refers to Muslims as Satan-worshippers and claimed the mosque had pamphlets on Islamic training camps in America and tips on getting more government assistance.\n\nDauenhauer stated the intent to take pamphlets from the mosque. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing they can do about it,\u201d Dauenhauer said. In one clip taken in the courtyard, Dauenhauer holds a child in one hand as she takes away pamphlets with the other hand.\n\nWhen standing on the mosque\u2019s lawn, Dauenhauer snapped a photo of the children and Gonzales sitting atop a wall around the building, with their thumbs pointed downward in disapproval.\n\nLater, one of the children climbed on the bumper of a funeral services van in the mosque\u2019s parking lot, looking into the vehicle as Dauenhauer and Gonzales told the boy to get off bumper.\n\n\u201cMuslims have been on there,\u201d Dauenhauer told the boy.\n\nGonzales does most of the talking during the 23-minute video. She said complains about Sharia law and said Muslims engage in bestiality and are destroying America.\n\nWhen she sees a no-guns sign on a gate on mosque property, Gonzales said, \u201cAhhh, but they carry around AKs and kill people all the time.\u201d\n\nNear the end of the video, the two women, children and their dogs stood in the parking lot as a man exited the mosque.\n\nOne of the dogs trotted over to the man, who, in response to a question from Gonzales, later identified himself as a practicing Muslim.\n\n\u201cStay away from our dogs, please. Don\u2019t eat them,\u201d Gonzales told the man, prompting guffaw from Dauenhauer.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d the man responded, later explaining that he was trying to be peaceful and didn\u2019t understand what Gonzales was talking about.\n\nGonzales kept yelling insults at the man as the shouting match continued.\n\nGonzales faces a disorderly conduct charge for allegedly using abusive language toward a person at the mosque.\n\nThe parents of the three children who were with the two women at the mosque haven\u2019t been publicly identified by authorities.\n\nEven so, Gonzales faces three misdemeanor charges of permitting life, health and morals of a minor to be imperiled by neglect, abuse or immoral associations.\n\n____\n\nFollow Jacques Billeaud at www.twitter.com/jacquesbilleaud", "SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif.

It doesn\u2019t change how vulnerable most states are to possible interference.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve shown will, they\u2019ve shown the capability,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said. \u201cI certainly can\u2019t speak to why they\u2019re doing or not doing something. But I would just offer to put it in a broader perspective \u2014 they have a full-court press through many means ... to try to affect our democracy.\u201d\n\nIn a news conference Wednesday after Democrats won control of the House, President Donald Trump said his administration worked hard to shore up elections and he\u2019d issue a report soon on the effort.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials have asserted that Russia, China, Iran and other countries are engaged in ongoing efforts to influence U.S. policy and voters in elections. Chris Krebs, head of cybersecurity at the Department of Homeland Security, said this year\u2019s election was the warm-up.\n\n\u201cThe midterm is not the big game,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big game we think for the adversaries is probably 2020.\u201d\n\nInterference by Russia during the 2016 presidential race caught federal and state officials flat-footed. Since then, Homeland Security, the department tasked with helping states securing election systems, and state election officials have worked to create better communication to confront and deter election tampering.\n\nThat effort was largely successful Tuesday: Federal experts and officials in 45 states came together to report on any potential cyber threats in real time.\n\nThe difference was stark compared to 2016, when federal officials were accused first of being too tight-lipped on their intelligence about possible hacking into state systems and later for trying to exert control over election infrastructure, which is operated by state and local governments.\n\nIntelligence officials say all 50 states had some type of intrusion attempt two years ago, although only a few were compromised. That included Illinois, where records on 90,000 voters had been downloaded. There is no evidence any votes were altered.\n\nKrebs said there was an increase this year in reporting of potential cyber incidents, but he attributed it to better communication, not an increase in overall threats.\n\n\u201cWe are getting an increase in reporting from our partners in general, but that\u2019s based on the relationships we\u2019ve developed over the last couple of years. Two years ago, in 2016, we didn\u2019t have an information-sharing mechanism. Now we do, so we have a better awareness.\u201d\n\nThe push will continue as state election officials work to certify winners. After that, federal officials will look at what worked and what didn\u2019t to see how communication and security can improve.\n\nOne challenge is the antiquated election equipment in many states. Outdated software, for example, is highly vulnerable to cyberattacks.\n\nCybersecurity experts say it\u2019s imperative that U.S. election officials take steps over the next two years to ensure that voting systems are updated and include a paper trail so election results are subject to a rigorous auditing process that can detect outside manipulation.\n\nFederal officials cautioned that the apparent absence of hacking this election does not mean foreign agents are keeping quiet. They have warned repeatedly that in addition to probing election equipment, Russia and others are using social media messaging to sow divisions throughout the country.\n\nJust hours before the polls opened, Facebook officials removed 30 Facebook accounts and 85 Instagram accounts after a tip from federal law enforcement that the accounts were linked to foreign entities. While social media companies are making an effort to identify fake accounts and bogus news stories, there is a concern it may not be enough to combat the foreign interference.\n\nThe Justice Department unsealed criminal charges in October detailing how a Russian troll farm created thousands of false social media profiles and email accounts that appeared to be from people inside the United States. The criminal complaint provided a clear picture that there is still a hidden but powerful Russian social media effort aimed at spreading distrust for American political candidates and causing divisions on social issues such as immigration, race and gun control.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing that, and we are seeing that from multiple nation states,\u201d Nielsen said.\n\nA Kremlin spokesman on Thursday called the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election a \u201cheadache\u201d for U.S. authorities and said it \u201chas nothing to do with us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Christina A.

That measurement of small particulate matter in the air is 20 times higher than what\u2019s considered safe by the World Health Organization and could seriously aggravate heart or lung diseases.\n\nThe government blamed the toxic stew on a combination of burning of stubble in agricultural fields and firecrackers. The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology said an increasing surface wind speed is expected to disperse pollutants in two to three days.\n\nMany revelers flouted the Supreme Court order that firecrackers could be exploded only between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Wednesday.

The issue was health care, the top concern for voters as they decided how to cast their ballots.\n\nThis week\u2019s election showed a nation increasingly \u2014 if belatedly \u2014 in step with former President Barack Obama\u2019s approach to it.\n\nHealth care was the top issue for about one-fourth of voters, ahead of immigration and jobs and the economy, according to VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 115,000 voters and about 22,000 nonvoters conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nThose most concerned with health care supported Democratic candidates overwhelmingly, helping the party claim the House.\n\nWhile Republicans\u2019 hold on the Senate grew, putting Democrats in control of the lower chamber makes it even less likely that Trump will be able to undo Obama\u2019s overhaul, which created subsidized coverage for some lower-income people, allowed states to expand Medicaid coverage for others with the federal government picking up most of the cost, and barred insurers from discriminating against people with pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nThe law was one of Obama\u2019s key legislative accomplishments, but it proved unpopular after Democrats passed it without a single Republican vote. A backlash propelled the GOP to take control of the House in 2010 and the Senate in 2014, significantly narrowing what Obama could accomplish.\n\nBut by last year, \u201cObamacare\u201d was popular enough that a GOP-controlled Senate blocked an effort to scrap the overhaul.\n\nThat vote was a factor in the only Senate race where a Republican incumbent lost a re-election bid.\n\nIn Nevada, where the majority of voters said they disapproved of Trump\u2019s handling of health care, Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen attacked incumbent Republican Sen. Dean Heller for supporting Trump\u2019s effort to repeal the health care law.\n\n\u201cIn time, changes will be made,\u201d Mike Leavitt, health secretary under President George W. Bush, told the AP. \u201cBut repealing the statute is now not possible, even in the mind of the most ardent opponent.\u201d\n\nThe health care impact of the election goes beyond Congress.\n\nVoters in the Republican-dominated states of Idaho, Nebraska and Utah all passed ballot measures to expand Medicaid, which could bring coverage for an additional 363,000 low-income adults, adding to the 12 million already covered by the expansion elsewhere. Under the Affordable Care Act, federal taxpayers pick up most of the bill for the expansion. Starting in 2020, states will have to contribute 10 percent of the cost.\n\n\u201cFor all the people who have been slipping through the cracks in our health care system in Utah, there is finally good news,\u201d RyLee Curtis, campaign manager for Utah Decides Healthcare, said Wednesday on a conference call with reporters. \u201cHelp is on the way.\u201d\n\nAdvocates, however, were disappointed by the outcome in Montana, where voters rejected a measure that would have made that state\u2019s Medicaid expansion permanent with financing from a tobacco tax. The debate isn\u2019t over, but it will move to the state legislature instead.\n\nJonathan Schleifer, executive director of The Fairness Project, which campaigned for the expansion measures, said states including Missouri, Florida and Oklahoma could be pursued for future ballot measures.\n\nDemocrats picked up governorships Tuesday in two states that may now expand Medicaid \u2014 Kansas and Wisconsin.\n\nIn Kansas, health care tied with immigration as voters\u2019 top issue. In Wisconsin, which did not join the federal Medicaid expansion but does allow more adults into the program already, it was the biggest concern identified by about one-third of voters.\n\nIn both states, about 7 in 10 of voters who said health care was their main concern voted for the Democrat for governor.\n\nThat helped put Tony Evers over the top in his race against incumbent Republican Scott Walker in Wisconsin and pushed Laura Kelly to victory in a close race against Republican Kris Kobach in Kansas.\n\nKelly got big cheers in her victory speech when she called for a Medicaid expansion, which she said was important \u201cso that more Kansans have access to affordable health care, our rural hospitals will stay open and the tax dollars we\u2019ve been sending to Washington will come back home.\u201d\n\nMedicaid was also a key issue in Maine, where voters last year approved a ballot measure to expand but where the current governor, Republican Paul LePage, refused to implement it. Democrat Janet Mills campaigned on implementing it and defeated Republican Shawn Moody, who campaigned against expansion.\n\nTuesday\u2019s election results were far less clear on where Americans stand on a move to universal health coverage, an idea that a growing number of Democratic candidates, including several considering presidential bids, have been backing.\n\nIn his campaign for governor in Florida, Democrat Andrew Gillum called health care for all a \u201cnorth star\u201d that the state should aspire to while offering up the intermediate step of expanding Medicaid as a must-do in the nation\u2019s third most populous state. The majority of Florida voters in the AP survey disapproved of Trump\u2019s handling of health care, and 3 in 5 also said it should be the government\u2019s responsibility to provide coverage.\n\nThere, health care was tied with immigration as voters\u2019 top concern and Republican Ron DeSantis, a former member of Congress closely aligned with Trump, won.\n\nMeanwhile in Colorado, Jared Polis, a Democrat, was elected governor while promoting a single-payer health system for the state. Voters there rejected a ballot measure to create such a system two years ago.\n\nCharles Idelson, a spokesman for National Nurses United, a group pushing for single-payer health coverage, said the number of supporters of the concept is increasing at all levels of government after the election despite what he called \u201cvilification of that issue and the demagoguery of that issue\u201d by Republicans in campaign ads.\n\nKathleen Sebelius, health secretary under Obama, told the AP she expects House Democrats to start designing a framework for covering all Americans and for that to be a major issue in 2020 elections.\n\n\u201cOne of the things this election clearly demonstrates is that health care for all is a unifying principle for the Democrats,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have been working toward that goal since 1965, when Medicare and Medicaid were passed.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMulvihill reported from Philadelphia.

Elijah Cummings, the Maryland Democrat poised to take charge of the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement to The Associated Press that he intends to use the panel as \u201ca check on the executive branch \u2014 not merely for potential criminal violations, but for much broader concerns, such as conflicts of interest, emoluments violations and waste, fraud and abuse.\u201d\n\nWhile Democrats taking over key House committees have not specifically telegraphed their targets, Cummings\u2019 committee would likely seek Trump\u2019s business tax returns and other company-related financial records, according to two Democratic congressional staffers who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss post-election plans.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal income taxes, which he withheld during the 2016 campaign and in his two years in office, are expected to be the purview of the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nInternal Revenue Service law allows House and Senate tax-writing committees to request federal returns, and the ranking Ways and Means Democrat, Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, has signaled publicly he would ask for them \u2014 a move the White House might fight.\n\nTrump said in a wide-ranging news conference Wednesday that he doesn\u2019t want to release his taxes because they are under a \u201ccontinuous audit.\u201d He also said: \u201cThey\u2019re extremely complex. People wouldn\u2019t understand them.\u201d\n\nFor the past two years, White House lawyers and the Trump Organization have repeatedly rebuffed Democratic efforts to get even the most basic financial information on Trump\u2019s businesses.\n\nWhen Cummings and other Democrats asked last year for records detailing Trump\u2019s separation from his businesses, they received an eight-page glossy pamphlet and a single email. When they asked how the Trump Organization arrived at the $151,470 in profits it paid back to the Treasury for foreign stays at his hotels, they got silence.\n\nNow with Democrats in control of the House, if Trump\u2019s companies or other interests ignore their subpoenas or try legal maneuvers to delay or spurn them, they could face a contempt citation to the House floor. Such citations could be taken to federal court for possible legal action.\n\nAny records Democrats manage to shake out could potentially have an impact on federal lawsuits Democrats are already pursuing against the president.\n\nFor example, Cummings and other Democratic lawmakers last year filed a federal lawsuit demanding disclosures of records to determine how Trump was approved by the General Services Administration to maintain the lease of the Trump International Hotel in Washington after he became president.\n\nThe hotel is housed in the historic Old Post Office, which is owned by the federal government, and its lease has a clause barring any \u201celected official of the government of the United States\u201d from deriving \u201cany benefit.\u201d Trump and his daughter Ivanka, a senior White House adviser, both retained their stakes in the property.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s a lawsuit against Trump by nearly 200 Democratic senators and representatives who accuse Trump of constantly violating the Constitution\u2019s emoluments provision banning the acceptance of gifts from foreign and domestic interests. Trump has not relinquished his ownership of his business empire.\n\nThough a separate case involving similar allegations filed by the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia is further along, the D.C. case is the only one that has congressional Democrats as the plaintiffs.\n\nThey argue that such favors to Trump include Chinese government trademarks for his companies, payments for hotel room stays and event-space rentals by representatives of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and proceeds from Chinese or Emirati-linked government purchases of office space in Trump Tower.\n\nTheir lawsuit also has a potential wrinkle that involves another figure of the tense midterm election season \u2014 newly confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Since some of the plaintiffs in the suit were among the senators on the Judiciary Committee against whom Kavanaugh lashed out during his confirmation hearing regarding sexual assault allegations, some legal experts believe there could be a case made for his recusal if their case ends up before him.\n\nIt would be up to Kavanaugh, however, to determine whether he felt he should recuse himself. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal before his recent confirmation vote, Kavanaugh said he had misspoken because he was upset and assured the public that he would act as a fair and impartial judge.\n\nKavanaugh is seen as a conservative swing vote with a record and public comments that suggest deference to the power of the chief executive but legal experts caution it is hard to predict what might happen if legal challenges on emoluments or Trump\u2019s business records make it to the high court.\n\nAny such predication, according to Seth Barrett Tillman, a law lecturer at Maynooth University in Ireland, is \u201cnot going to vastly outperform astrology or tarot cards.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams", "WINDOW ROCK, Ariz.

Though Sessions was an early and prominent campaign backer of Trump, his departure letter lacked effusive praise for the president and made clear the resignation came \u201cat your request.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions was pushed out Wednesday as the country's chief law enforcement officer after enduring more than a year of blistering and personal attacks from President Donald Trump over his recusal from the Russia investigation. (Nov. 7)\n\n\u201cSince the day I was honored to be sworn in as attorney general of the United States, I came to work at the Department of Justice every day determined to do my duty and serve my country,\u201d Sessions wrote.\n\nThe departure was the culmination of a toxic relationship that frayed just weeks into Sessions\u2019 tenure, when he stepped aside from the Russia investigation because of his campaign advocacy and following the revelation that he had met twice in 2016 with the Russian ambassador to the U.S.\n\nTrump blamed the recusal for the appointment of Mueller, who took over the Russia investigation two months later and began examining whether Trump\u2019s hectoring of Sessions was part of a broader effort to obstruct the probe.\n\nThe investigation has produced 32 criminal charges and guilty pleas from four former Trump aides. But the work is not done, and critical decisions await that could shape the remainder of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nA Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, on Thursday called Mueller\u2019s investigation a \u201cheadache\u201d for U.S. authorities but said it \u201chas nothing to do with us,\u201d and he declined to comment on Sessions\u2019 departure.\n\nMueller\u2019s grand jury has heard testimony for months about Trump confidant Roger Stone and what advance knowledge he may have had about Russian hacking of Democratic emails. Mueller\u2019s team also has been pressing for an interview with Trump. And the department is expected to receive a confidential report of Mueller\u2019s findings, though it\u2019s unclear how much will be public.\n\nSeparately, Justice Department prosecutors in New York secured a guilty plea from Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who said the president directed him to arrange hush money payments before the 2016 election to two women who said they had sex with Trump.\n\nTrump had repeatedly been talked out of firing Sessions until after the midterms, but he told confidants in recent weeks that he wanted Sessions out as soon as possible after the elections, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations.\n\nThe president deflected questions about Sessions\u2019 expected departure at a White House news conference Wednesday. He did not mention that White House chief of staff John Kelly had called Sessions beforehand to ask for his resignation. The undated letter was then sent to the White House.\n\nThe Justice Department did not directly answer whether Whitaker would assume control of Mueller\u2019s investigation, with spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores saying he would be \u201cin charge of all matters under the purview of the Department of Justice.\u201d\n\nRosenstein remains at the department and could still be involved in oversight. He has previously said that he saw no basis for firing Mueller. Trump said Wednesday that he did not plan to stop the investigation.\n\nWithout Sessions\u2019 campaign or Russia entanglements, there\u2019s no legal reason Whitaker couldn\u2019t immediately oversee the probe. And since Sessions technically resigned instead of forcing the White House to fire him, he opened the door under federal law to allowing the president to choose his successor instead of simply elevating Rosenstein, said University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck.\n\n\u201cSessions did not do the thing he could have done to better protect Rosenstein, and through Rosenstein, the Mueller investigation,\u201d Vladeck said.\n\nThat left Whitaker in charge, at least for now, though Democrats, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, said he should recuse himself because of his comments on the probe. Rep. Jerry Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said he wants \u201canswers immediately\u201d and \u201cwe will hold people accountable.\u201d\n\nWhitaker, a former U.S. attorney from Iowa who twice ran unsuccessfully for statewide office and founded a law firm with other Republican Party activists, once opined about a scenario in which Trump could fire Sessions and then appoint an acting attorney general who could stifle the funding of Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\nIn that scenario, Mueller\u2019s budget could be reduced \u201cso low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt,\u201d Whitaker said during an interview with CNN in July 2017 before he joined the Justice Department.\n\nIn a CNN op-ed last year, Whitaker wrote, \u201cMueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s relentless attacks on Sessions came even though the Alabama Republican was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump and despite the fact his crime-fighting agenda and priorities, particularly his hawkish immigration enforcement policies, largely mirrored the president\u2019s.\n\nHe found satisfaction in being able to reverse Obama-era policies that conservatives say flouted the will of Congress, encouraging prosecutors to pursue the most serious charges they could and promoting more aggressive enforcement of federal marijuana law.\n\nHe also announced media leak crackdowns and tougher policies against opioids, and his Justice Department defended a since-abandoned administration policy that resulted in migrant parents being separated from their children at the border.\n\nBut the relationship was irreparably damaged in March 2017 when Sessions, acknowledging previously undisclosed meetings with the Russian ambassador and citing his work as a campaign aide, recused himself from the Russia investigation.\n\nTrump repeatedly lamented that he would have never selected Sessions if he had known the attorney general would recuse himself. The recusal left the investigation in the hands of Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller two months later after Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey.\n\nIn piercing attacks, Trump called Sessions weak and beleaguered, complained that he wasn\u2019t more aggressively pursuing allegations of corruption against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and called it \u201cdisgraceful\u201d that Sessions wasn\u2019t more serious in scrutinizing the origins of the Russia investigation for possible law enforcement bias \u2014 even though the attorney general did ask the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general to examine those claims.\n\nThe broadsides escalated in recent months, with Trump telling an interviewer that Sessions \u201cnever had control\u201d of the Justice Department.\n\nSessions endured most of the name-calling in silence, though he did issue two public statements defending the department, including one in which he said he would serve \u201cwith integrity and honor\u201d for as long as he was in the job.\n\nSessions, who likely suspected his ouster was imminent, was spotted by reporters giving some of his grandchildren a tour of the White House over the weekend.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Suddenly facing life under divided government, President Donald Trump and congressional leaders talked bipartisanship but then bluntly previewed the fault lines to come. Trump threatened to go after House Democrats who try to investigate him, while Rep. Nancy Pelosi said her party would be \u201ca check and balance\u201d against the White House.\n\nThe day after midterm elections reset Washington, Trump took a victory lap at a raucous news conference, celebrating Republican Senate wins but distancing himself from the GOP\u2019s loss of the House. He said Wednesday he was interested in working with House Democrats but was ready to respond if he felt he was being ill-treated.\n\nAs long as Republicans have controlled both houses of Congress, Democrats have been hampered in pursuing any significant probes of Trump and his administration, and he made it clear he expects the Senate to follow that course.\n\n\u201cThey can play that game,\u201d he said of possible House Democratic investigations, \u201cbut we can play it better, because we have a thing called the United States Senate.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump is warning House Democrats about spending the remaining years of his presidency investigating him and his administration.

And Pelosi, who is expected to run for a second stint as speaker when Democrats take the House majority in January, said the party has \u201ca responsibility to seek common ground where we can.\u201d But she added, \u201cWhere we cannot, we must stand our ground.\u201d\n\nAfter midterm elections that served as a referendum on Trump\u2019s divisive presidency, Congress and the White House reckoned Wednesday with expected Republican gains in the Senate and a Democratic flip of the House. The early positioning provided the first glimpse of how all parties will balance calls for bipartisanship with an appetite for anger going into the next two years.\n\nBy turns combative and conciliatory, Trump said Democrats and Republicans should set aside partisanship to work together. On legislative prospects, Trump said he could potentially work with Democrats on issues such as taxes, infrastructure and health care, saying it \u201creally could be a beautiful, bipartisan type of situation.\u201d\n\nAnd Pelosi, during a news conference that was delayed because of Trump\u2019s lengthy remarks, said she had worked productively with President George W. Bush when she was speaker a decade ago on taxes and other issues, and she welcomed the chance to do so again with Trump.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to work together so our legislation will be bipartisan,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, Pelosi said Democrats weren\u2019t elected to be \u201ca rubber stamp\u201d for Trump.\n\nSome House Democrats have threatened to use the subpoena power they will gain in January to investigate Trump and administration actions. But, he warned, he will respond in kind and government will suffer.\n\nPlus, he said, Democrats have \u201cnothing, zero,\u201d on him. Of the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation that has shadowed his administration for more than 18 months, Trump said, \u201cI could end it right now\u201d but \u201cI let it go on.\u201d\n\nShortly thereafter, however, it was announced that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had been forced out. His departure followed 18 months of criticism and insults from Trump, who had appointed him but objected to Sessions\u2019 stepping aside from the Russia probe rather than guiding. It.\n\nOn the potential for House investigations, Pelosi said Democrats will have a \u201cresponsibility for oversight\u201d when they take charge in January and she will leave final decisions to committees. She wouldn\u2019t answer a question about whether Democrats will seek Trump\u2019s tax filings, but said committee requests for documents and hearings won\u2019t be \u201cscattershot.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are expected to investigate Trump\u2019s business dealings, his Cabinet\u2019s conduct and his campaign\u2019s possible ties to Russia, among other issues.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll know what we are doing and we\u2019ll do it right,\u201d she said.\n\nPelosi spoke with Trump and McConnell after the Democrats\u2019 victory.

Already the only woman to have held the job, she would also become one of the few lawmakers to reclaim the gavel after losing it.\n\nPelosi is a \u201csmart woman,\u201d Trump said Wednesday during a nearly 90-minute news conference at the White House, and someone with whom he hopes to engage in \u201cbeautiful bipartisanship\u201d and deal-making. It was a role reversal from just days ago, when he warned voters of her \u201cradical\u201d agenda.\n\nShe \u201cdeserved\u201d to become speaker again after winning the House, Trump said Wednesday, adding that he looked forward to doing \u201ca tremendous amount of legislation\u201d once power in Congress is divided between a Democratic House and Republican Senate.\n\nAt the Capitol, in the stately Rayburn Room \u2014 named after the last speaker who returned to the office \u2014 Pelosi was asked if she was confident she would become speaker when the new Congress convenes in January. She said simply: \u201cYes, I am.\u201d\n\nYet ascent of the California Democrat is nowhere near guaranteed. Many younger House Democrats, including some of the newly elected, have pledged to vote against her. They are reluctant to shout the name \u201cPelosi\u201d when the cameras zoom in during the first roll call of Congress, fearful of the attack ads that will be launched against them.\n\nAs Trump and Pelosi extended overtures across Pennsylvania Avenue, they also shadowboxed around the new dynamic created by the House\u2019s ability to probe the president\u2019s business dealings and his administration. The president warned Democrats not to push too hard with their investigations, or he would smack back even harder; Pelosi vowed that they would conduct responsible oversight.\n\nThe two have reasons to cooperate. Both want to score legislative wins to bring to voters ahead of the 2020 election. They talked on election night about doing an infrastructure package and lowering health care costs, particularly around prescription drugs, priorities for both sides.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of opportunity,\u201d Pelosi said, noting she worked productively with President George W.

But becoming speaker requires a majority of the full House, 218 votes, and her slim majority \u2014 now at 222 \u2014 leaves her little cushion.\n\nIt\u2019s not just her. Pelosi heads a trio of septuagenarian leaders, with Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer and Assistant Leader Jim Clyburn, who have held power since the last time Democrats took back the House majority, in 2006. Each is poised to move up a slot.\n\nDemocrats who want new leadership have been whispering about it for weeks, and on Wednesday, several Pelosi opponents announced their intent to run for the top posts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been saying for a long time that the Democratic Party leadership is in dire need of change,\u201d wrote Rep. Filemon Vela of Texas, one of two who wants to run for the No. 3 job of chief vote-counter. \u201cYa es tiempo de un cambio!\u201d he echoed his statement in Spanish.\n\nAnother Democrat, Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado, also jumped into the whip\u2019s race.\n\nBoth candidacies are a direct affront to Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American in Congress, who is in line to become the whip. He announced his bid Wednesday, pledging to \u201cmake America\u2019s greatness apply fairly and equitably to all Americans.\u201d\n\nThree others announced their runs for assistant leader, the new No. 4 post, including Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, the chairman of the campaign committee who helped lead his colleagues to the majority.\n\nSo far, though, no one has mounted a serious direct challenge to Pelosi, and some are reluctant to take on the first female speaker after an election that brought a record number of women to the polls and to the House.\n\n\u2033\u2018Thank you for returning us to the majority.

(AP Photo/Juan Karita)\n\nLA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) \u2014 The snow appears to be pristine on the Andean peaks that loom above Bolivia\u2019s capital, but even here ash and smog reach up to a remote plateau that is home to the world\u2019s highest atmospheric observatory.\n\nIt\u2019s an ideal site for a team of international scientists who collect data on pollution that has contributed to the rapid disappearance of Andean glaciers.\n\nResearch at the Chacaltaya station, which is located at 17,192 feet (5,240 meters) above sea level, has a pressing urgency: The retreat of glaciers, which is compounded by global warming, threatens the main source of fresh water for residents in the nearby cities of EL Alto and La Paz \u2014 and the crops on which they rely.\n\n\u201cIf temperatures continue to rise, these high-altitude glaciers will also lose their mass of ice and there will only be snow on the summit,\u201d said glaciologist Patrick Ginot. \u201cThis will happen all along the Andes.\u201d\n\nLast year, Ginot was part of a team of scientists that transported chunks of ice from a melting Bolivian glacier to Antarctica to be preserved for posterity and future study as part of a global project called \u201cIce Memory.\u201d\n\nThe Chacaltaya station is an important place to collect data samples partly due to its own location on the remnants of a glacier. The glacier, which is thought to be about 18,000 years old, once served as the site of Bolivia\u2019s only ski resort before it melted a decade ago.\n\nInitially, the station was launched as a cosmic ray observatory in the mid-1940s, when just hauling up heavy scientific instruments on the back of llamas was a feat in itself.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The White House has suspended the press pass of CNN correspondent Jim Acosta after he and President Donald Trump had a heated confrontation during a news conference.\n\nThey began sparring Wednesday after Acosta asked Trump about the caravan of migrants heading from Latin America to the southern U.S. border. When Acosta tried to follow up with another question, Trump said, \u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d and a female White House aide unsuccessfully tried to grab the microphone from Acosta.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders released a statement accusing Acosta of \u201cplacing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern,\u201d calling it \u201cabsolutely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe interaction between Acosta and the intern was brief, and Acosta appeared to brush her arm as she reached for the microphone and he tried to hold onto it. \u201cPardon me, ma\u2019am,\u201d he told her.\n\nAcosta tweeted that Sanders\u2019 statement that he put his hands on the aide was \u201ca lie.\u201d\n\nCNN said in a statement that the White House revoked Acosta\u2019s press pass out of \u201cretaliation for his challenging questions\u201d Wednesday, and the network accused Sanders of lying about Acosta\u2019s actions.\n\n\u2033(Sanders) provided fraudulent accusations and cited an incident that never happened. This unprecedented decision is a threat to our democracy and the country deserves better,\u201d CNN said. \u201cJim Acosta has our full support.\u201d\n\nJournalists assigned to cover the White House apply for passes that allow them daily access to press areas in the West Wing. White House staffers decide whether journalists are eligible, though the Secret Service determines whether their applications are approved.\n\nThe post-midterm election news conference marked a new low in the president\u2019s relationship with journalists.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a hostile media,\u201d Trump said after ordering reporter April Ryan of the American Urban Radio Networks to sit down when she tried to ask him a question.\n\nThe president complained that the media did not cover the humming economy and was responsible for much of the country\u2019s divided politics. He said, \u201cI can do something fantastic, and they make it look not good.\u201d\n\nHis exchanges with CNN\u2019s Acosta and NBC News\u2019 Peter Alexander turned bitterly personal, unusual even for a forum where the nature of their jobs often put presidents and the press at odds.\n\n\u201cI came in here as a nice person wanting to answer questions, and I had people jumping out of their seats screaming questions at me,\u201d said Trump, who talked for nearly 90 minutes despite the run-ins with reporters.\n\nAcosta asked Trump why the caravan of migrants was emphasized as an issue in the just-concluded midterm races, and he questioned Trump\u2019s reference to the caravan as an invasion.\n\n\u201cYou should let me run the country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou run CNN and if you did it well, your ratings would be much better.\u201d\n\nAfter Acosta asked about the investigation of Russia\u2019s involvement in the 2016 election, Trump tried to turn to Alexander, but Acosta continued to ask questions.\n\n\u201cCNN should be ashamed of itself having you work for them,\u201d the president said to Acosta. \u201cYou are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn\u2019t be working for CNN. The way you treat Sarah Sanders is horrible. The way you treat other people is horrible. You shouldn\u2019t treat people that way.\u201d\n\nAlexander came to his colleague\u2019s defense. \u201cI\u2019ve traveled with him and watched him,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cHe\u2019s a diligent reporter who busts his butt like the rest of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of yours, either,\u201d Trump replied.\n\n\u201cI understand,\u201d Alexander said, attempting to ask a question. Acosta stood back up and noted the explosive devices that were recently sent to CNN and some of the president\u2019s political opponents.\n\n\u201cJust sit down,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.\u201d\n\nCNN said Trump\u2019s attacks on the press have gone too far.\n\n\u201cThey are not only dangerous, they are disturbingly un-American,\u201d CNN tweeted after the exchange. \u201cWhile President Trump has made it clear he does not respect a free press, he has a sworn obligation to protect it. A free press is vital to democracy, and we stand behind Jim Acosta and his fellow journalists everywhere.\u201d\n\nIn announcing Acosta\u2019s suspension, Sanders said, \u201cThe fact that CNN is proud of the way their employee behaved is not only disgusting, it is an example of their outrageous disregard for everyone, including young women, who work in this administration.\u201d\n\nThe White House Correspondents\u2019 Association released a statement Wednesday saying it \u201cstrongly objects to the Trump Administration\u2019s decision to use U.S. Secret Service security credentials as a tool to punish a reporter with whom it has a difficult relationship. Revoking access to the White House complex is a reaction out of line to the purported offense and is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe WHCA called on the White House to \u201cimmediately reverse this weak and misguided action.\u201d\n\nDuring the news conference, Trump also turned on reporter Yamiche Alcindor of PBS\u2019 \u201cNewsHour.\u201d She said that \u201con the campaign trail, you called yourself a nationalist. Some people saw that as emboldening white nationalists.\u201d Trump interrupted her, calling it a racist question.\n\nAlcindor pressed on: \u201cThere are some people who say the Republican Party is seen as supporting white nationalists because of your rhetoric. What do you say to that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you said is so insulting to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very terrible thing you said to me.\u201d\n\nAlcindor moved on to a different topic. Later, via Twitter, she said that she has interviewed white nationalists who say they are more excited by Trump than they have been about other presidents. \u201cEven if President Trump doesn\u2019t intend it, some see him as directly appealing to the racists,\u201d she wrote.\n\nTrump told Ryan, of American Urban Radio Networks, repeatedly to sit down when she attempted to ask Trump about accusations of voter suppression. He said she was rude for interrupting another reporter, though he did briefly answer one of Ryan\u2019s questions.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the NBC News correspondent is named Peter Alexander, not Peter Garrett.", "SACATON, Ariz.

But President Donald Trump\u2019s Republican Party found strength in critical states that often hold the keys to the presidency.\n\nPerhaps no state offered Democrats more hope than Wisconsin, which shocked the party in 2016 by narrowly falling into Trump\u2019s column. Republican Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s narrow loss in his bid for a third term left Democrats optimistic they could reclaim Wisconsin along with other traditionally blue states that Trump carried, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cTo have Walker lose is a significant turning point that the right candidate in 2020 could win all of these states\u201d across the industrial north, Democratic pollster Paul Maslin, who advised Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin\u2019s campaign. \u201cIf they do, Trump\u2019s map starts to get more difficult.\u201d\n\nStill, there are plenty of reasons for caution for Democrats. Gains in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania were offset by mixed results in Ohio and GOP dominance in electoral powerhouse Florida.\n\nIn Ohio, Republicans came out on top in the governor\u2019s race and a handful of other statewide offices. The GOP kept their 12-4 majority in the U.S. House delegation.\n\nOhio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, who won another term representing a district that Hillary Clinton won in 2016, called it a \u201creally bad election night\u201d for his party. But he said Democrats were able to win when they focused on \u201cbread-and-butter economic issues,\u201d the way he and Sen. Sherrod Brown, who also won re-election Tuesday, did.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not connecting with the workers, then you\u2019re not going to be able to do well,\u201d Ryan said in an interview. \u201cTrump connected to the workers. If we don\u2019t do that, if we\u2019re continuing to be seen as elite and that people are \u2018deplorables\u2019 if they don\u2019t vote for us, we\u2019re going to have a big problem.\u201d\n\nIn his victory speech, Brown said his state had provided a \u201cblueprint for America in 2020.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, though, pointed to Trump\u2019s 8-point victory in Ohio in 2016, and the four campaign visits he made to the state, including a southwest Ohio jaunt three weeks before the election. Trump remains very popular in the region, spanning from the politically swing-voting Hamilton County eastward along a string of Ohio River counties that the president carried by more than 30 percentage points.\n\nThe area\u2019s white and vastly rural profile outside Cincinnati is part of what is expected to keep Ohio from springing back easily for Democrats, Hamilton County Republican Chairman Alex Triantafilou said.\n\n\u201cI think southwest Ohio is becoming more reliably red under President Trump,\u201d Triantafilou said. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a turnout benefit to talking to conservatives the way Trump has.\u201d\n\nThere were also warning signs for Democrats in Florida, a perennial swing state that is increasingly delivering victories \u2014 however narrow \u2014 to the GOP. Republican Ron DeSantis defeated Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, handing Democrats their third consecutive loss for the Florida governor\u2019s mansion. Adding to their trouble was incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson trailing Republican Rick Scott.\n\nOne bright note for Democrats in Florida was the passage of Amendment 4, which will restore voting rights to most felons when they complete their sentences and probation, adding 1.4 million possible voters to the rolls. It\u2019s unclear how this group of people will affect the 2020 election.\n\nDemocrats also see bright signs in places like Nevada, once a conservative state that is now more consistently trending blue. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Democratic campaign for Senate in Texas fell short by less than 3 percentage points in Texas, a GOP-heavy state that hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1994. And Democrat Stacey Abrams ran a competitive campaign for governor in Georgia, which hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat to the governor\u2019s mansion since 1998.\n\n\u201cThere are some assumptions about states Democratic presidential candidates will visit that are being truly reconsidered,\u201d Democratic strategist Anita Dunn said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about changing the map.\u201d\n\nTensions were already flaring over what type of candidate could capitalize on the emerging 2020 map.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a huge field, but the big question will be whether they learn lessons from the midterms because I think the electorate was trying to tell us something loudly and clearly,\u201d Matt Bennett of Third Way, a centrist think tank, said in an interview. \u201cThe message they were trying to send us is you\u2019ve got to beat Trump in the battleground states, and you\u2019ve got to run on very mainstream, nonextreme Democratic ideals and values.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people that ran that way won in those tough places,\u201d Bennett added, \u201cand the people who didn\u2019t run that way lost almost everywhere.\u201d\n\nBut Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said he saw a shifting center of gravity within the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cThanks to Stacey Abrams, Andrew Gillum and Beto O\u2019Rourke, places where Democrats have had trouble winning for years became unpredictable toss-ups in large part because of an electorate inspired by never-before-heard bold visions for economic and racial justice,\u201d Green said.", "PEORIA, Ill.

The city will eventually form a master plan to guide the property\u2019s development.\n\nThe site does present a few problems. Any major development will require additional engineering, creating additional costs, because the property falls in a seismic zone, Jones-Vogel said.

(AP) \u2014 If the Florida Senate race between incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson and Gov. Rick Scott requires a recount, there is no need to worry about it being a repeat of the 2000 presidential debacle \u2014 there won\u2019t be any hanging chads and the process is likely to take days, not a month.\n\nThe race was too close to call and Scott\u2019s lead as of Wednesday evening was about 30,000 votes out of more than 8.1 million cast \u2014 a margin of less than one half of 1 percent. Under state law in Florida, a recount is mandatory if the winning candidate\u2019s margin is 0.5 percentage points or less. That will be determined this weekend by Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner after the canvassing boards in each of Florida\u2019s 67 counties certify their returns. The recount, if ordered, would likely begin Monday.\n\nChris Hartline, a spokesman for Scott\u2019s campaign, criticized the Nelson campaign for pushing ahead for a recount instead of conceding. Scott gave a victory speech late Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThis race is over,\u201d Hartline said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad way for Bill Nelson to end his career. He is desperately trying to hold on to something that no longer exists.\u201d\n\nNelson and his campaign staff say they intend to let the process proceed and will have monitors in every county. Late Wednesday, an attorney for Nelson said he intends to aggressively examine and address reports of ballot problems. The Nelson campaign believes the results of the election are still unknown since there are ballots yet to be counted, Marc Elias said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing this not just because it\u2019s automatic, but we\u2019re doing it to win,\u201d Elias said.\n\nThe process, if it goes forward, will be different than the one that gained international notoriety in 2000, when the Supreme Court ordered an end to vote counting in Florida after a month, allowing Republican George W. Bush to claim the presidency with 537 votes.\n\nAt the time, each county had its own voting system. Many used punch cards \u2014 voters poked out chads, leaving tiny holes in their ballots representing their candidates. Some voters, however, didn\u2019t fully punch out the presidential chad or gave it just a little push. Those hanging and dimpled chads had to be examined by the canvassing boards, a lengthy and tiresome process that became fodder for late-night comedians.\n\nNow, all Florida counties use ballots where voters use a pen to fill in a bubble next to their candidate\u2019s name, much like a student does when taking a multiple-choice test. When voters finish marking their ballots, they run them through a scanning machine that records the count. The ballot is stored inside the machine.\n\nIf the recount happens, each county will again run each Senate ballot through a scanner under the watchful eye of representatives of both sides. Ballots that cannot be read because they aren\u2019t marked or mismarked will be set aside.\n\nIf the statewide margin then falls below 0.25 percentage points, Detzner will order a manual recount in each county. Rejected ballots will be examined by counting teams to determine if the voters\u2019 intentions were obvious. If either side objects to a counting team\u2019s decision or the team can\u2019t make a decision, the ballot will be forwarded to the county\u2019s canvassing board, with the three members voting on the final decision. The members are the county supervisor of elections, a judge and the chair of the county commissioners.\n\nThe process will likely be finished in days.\n\nThe two candidates are heavyweights within each party: Nelson has withstood years of GOP dominance to remain the only Democrat elected statewide, while Scott is a two-term governor urged by President Donald Trump to take Nelson on.\n\nNelson was viewed as one of the more vulnerable Democrats thanks to the formidable challenge from Scott, a former hospital chain CEO who has poured more than $60 million of his own fortune into his campaign.\n\nThe two candidates disagreed on issues ranging from gun control to environmental policy and health care. Nelson was a strong supporter of the federal health care overhaul pushed into law by President Barack Obama, while Scott had called for the law to be repealed and replaced.\n\nScott, however, was forced to air a television ad in which he promised to retain the current plan\u2019s consumer protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Florida is among the states that are part of a lawsuit challenging the overhaul. The lawsuit was handled by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Scott maintained that he was not consulted about it before it was filed. But after he was aware of it, he remained largely silent until it became an issue in the campaign.\n\nDifferences between Scott and Nelson took a back seat to mutual disparagement and personal attacks, as well as Scott\u2019s links to Trump. At first Scott distanced himself from the president, but in the final week of the race he showed up at two political rallies Trump held in Florida.\n\n___\n\nSpencer reported from Fort Lauderdale.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "STRATFORD, N.H.

They spent seven hours instructing the Hall of Fame coach, who then treated them to a night in San Francisco for the big assist.\n\nSix months later Stanford used all of that knowledge to beat the Aggies.\n\nKiana Williams had 14 points and three assists playing 18 minutes, leading No. 7 Stanford past cold-shooting UC Davis 71-43 on Wednesday night in both teams\u2019 season opener.\n\n\u201cI told Jen before the game, \u2018If we play well it\u2019s a credit to you,\u2019\u201d VanDerveer said. \u201d...

The Cardinal wound up shooting 42.6 percent.\n\n\u201cWe need to take care of the ball better, we need to shoot a better percentage,\u201d VanDerveer said. \u201cI think we\u2019re a much better shooting team than that.\u201d\n\nTWIN FACTOR\n\nStanford has freshman twins Lacie and Lexie Hull. UC Davis has twins, too, senior sisters Karley and Kourtney Eaton.\n\nLexie Hull started and had 11 points and 11 rebounds in her collegiate debut, receiving an unsportsmanlike foul call upon review in the second quarter for making contact with Bertsch under the basket. Lacie scored two points on 1-for-5 shooting.\n\n\u201cThat foul when you\u2019re playing as hard as you can things like that are going to happen.

Kang quoted U.S. officials as saying that it was North Korea that canceled a meeting this week between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a senior North Korean official on nuclear issues. (Kim Ju-hyung/Yonhap via AP)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korea\u2019s foreign minister said Thursday that U.S. officials told Seoul that it was North Korea that canceled nuclear talks this week between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a senior North Korean official.\n\nForeign Minister Kang Kyung-wha provided no reason, aside from \u201cbusy schedules,\u201d for why North Korea canceled the meeting set for Thursday in New York that was meant to discuss ridding the North of its nuclear weapons and setting up a second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nBut some analysts say a last-minute cancellation \u2014 a familiar North Korean tactic \u2014 could be aimed at pressuring the United States to agree to a quick Trump-Kim summit because the North thinks it can win major concessions from Trump that lower-level U.S. officials might try to block. The U.S. president has recently appeared to be slowing the pace of diplomacy with North Korea amid signs that Kim is lagging behind in his supposed promise to denuclearize.\n\nBefore this week\u2019s cancellation, Trump said he wouldn\u2019t play a \u201ctime game\u201d with the North over a denuclearization deal, while his national security director, John Bolton, said a second Kim-Trump summit won\u2019t happen until 2019.\n\nNorth Korea has yet to comment on the cancellation.\n\nTrump and Kim held a highly choreographed summit in June in Singapore, where they announced aspirational goals for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing how and when it would occur.\n\nBut North Korea has since insisted that U.S.-led sanctions against it should be lifted before there will be any progress in nuclear negotiations. This has fueled doubts about whether Kim will ever deal away a nuclear program he may see as his strongest guarantee of survival. Washington says the sanctions will remain until North Korea takes concrete steps toward irreversibly and verifiably relinquishing its nuclear weapons.\n\nMany officials in the U.S. administration want to take time in setting up a summit because they\u2019re trying to get something more substantial after widespread criticism that Trump made large concessions to Kim in the first summit without getting much in return, said Park Hyeong-jung, an analyst from the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul.\n\nThis would require that the U.S. and North Korea hammer out details in lower-level talks about what can be exchanged at the next summit, but the cancellation of the meeting between Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol indicates that the two sides remain far apart, Park said.\n\nCritics say Trump\u2019s decision to start off his North Korean diplomacy with a leaders\u2019 summit, instead of building upward from lower-level talks, bestowed legitimacy on the North before it took any meaningful steps toward denuclearization. After his June meeting with Kim, Trump raised security jitters in Seoul by abruptly canceling major U.S. military exercises with South Korea which North Korea had termed invasion rehearsals.\n\n\u201cFor North Korea, there has never been a U.S. president like Trump,\u201d Park said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t ask too many questions or dig too much into details. The North simply got what it wanted the last time.\u201d\n\nForeign Minister Kang told lawmakers she planned to discuss the matter with Pompeo over the phone. South Korea\u2019s presidential office earlier said that the meeting\u2019s postponement wouldn\u2019t affect the momentum of talks between the U.S. and North Korea.\n\n\u201cWe were notified by the United States that North Korea explained that (the meeting) should be postponed because both sides have busy schedules,\u201d Kang said. \u201cI think it would be excessive to read too much into the postponement of the meeting.\u201d\n\nTrump told reporters at the White House that the United States is \u201cin no rush\u201d and that the meeting between Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol would be rescheduled.\n\nU.S. State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said the postponement was \u201cpurely a scheduling issue\u201d but refused to elaborate. He did not provide a straightforward answer when asked whether the discord over sanctions has made it more difficult to set up meetings.\n\n\u201cTiming, timing,\u201d Palladino said. \u201cThis has to do with timing as a matter \u2014 we\u2019re talking about scheduling. And I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d\n\nSeoul has worked hard to revive nuclear diplomacy between the U.S. and North Korea that has reduced war fears among South Koreans following a provocative run in North Korean weapons tests and Trump\u2019s threats of military action last year.\n\nKim Jong Un shifted to diplomacy early this year and has held three summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.

Gasol grabbed 12 rebounds.\n\nGary Harris led the Nuggets with 20 points, and Trey Lyles added 16 off the bench.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)\n\nSHANGHAI (AP) \u2014 Visitors to a vast trade fair meant to rebrand China as a welcoming import market could sip Moroccan wine, ogle Italian yachts and watch a Japanese industrial robot play ping-pong.\n\nThe communist government\u2019s marketing extravaganza involving 3,600 companies from 152 countries showcases the promise and challenges of China\u2019s growing, state-dominated and intensely competitive markets.\n\nAt a stand for German robot maker Jungheinrich AG, spectators watched a bright yellow automated forklift shift bulky cartons. A manager, Christian Wurzinger, said China accounts for one-third of its global sales but the Hamburg company wants to expand beyond factories and logistics into health and other industries.\n\nThe expo gives \u201cvery good access to Chinese companies, especially outside big cities,\u201d said Wurzinger. \u201cWe are lucky to be here.\u201d\n\nStill, he said Jungheinrich already faces Chinese competition: \u201cThere are plenty of local Chinese manufacturers with pretty good technology, to be honest.\u201d\n\nThe China International Import Expo is part of efforts to develop China-centered world trading networks while resisting pressure to roll back industry plans that Washington, Europe, Japan and other governments say violate its market-opening obligations.\n\nEager to dispel complaints they abuse the global trading system, China\u2019s leaders are touting its growing demand for foreign food, luxury brands, entertainment and other goods.\n\nChina already is the No. 1 market for most of its Asian neighbors. But a big share of those imports is iron ore, computer chips and other materials that are turned into smartphones, toys and other goods for export.\n\nThat is changing as communist leaders promote consumer spending as part of efforts to develop self-sustaining economic growth and reduce reliance on trade and investment. That holds out the promise of a market of 1.4 billion consumers, even if incomes are a fraction of those in developed countries.\n\nOn the expo\u2019s opening day, President Xi Jinping promised Monday to boost imports, cut costs for importers, protect patents and improve consumer spending power. But he did not address U.S. and European complaints about technology policy that prompted President Donald Trump to impose penalty tariffs of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese goods.\n\nImporters into China must contend with a thicket of restrictions and, in autos and other industries, pressure to help develop potential Chinese competitors as the price of market access.\n\nTarvand Saffron, an Iranian exporter of saffron, was invited to the expo by a Chinese state-owned company. But export manager Amir Reza Jalalian said food regulations bar sales of its product in China.\n\n\u201cMaybe in the future we can import saffron,\u201d Jalalian said, as visitors crowded around the company\u2019s stand to smell the crimson spice.\n\nBusiness groups complain that while Beijing increases imports to serve its factories and consumers, foreign companies are being squeezed out of technology and other promising industries.\n\nExhibitors at the expo ranged from General Motors and Lego toys to Brazilian shoemakers, a Korean dumpling brand and Uganda\u2019s National Enterprise Corp., an exporter of coffee and honey.\n\nVisitors crowded around a stand for Japan\u2019s Omron Corp. to watch an industrial robot hit a ping-pong ball back and forth with a human opponent.\n\nGlobal auto, aerospace and technology brands already are well known in China, suggesting many were at the expo not to sell but to nurture relations with the Communist Party by showing support for Xi\u2019s trade initiative.\n\n\u201cFor the bulk of China\u2019s imports, these expos don\u2019t make much difference,\u201d said Gareth Leather of Capital Economics. \u201cFor companies from smaller, developing countries, probably at the margins they do make a bit of a difference.\u201d\n\nAt a stand promoting Polish poultry, visitors lined up for bowls of chicken in cream sauce made by cooks led by celebrity chef Artur Moroz.\n\nNearby, visitors sipped red and white wines from La Ferme Rouge, a winery in Morocco in North Africa. It produces exclusive batches under the labels of luxury hotels in Morocco and wants to market that service to high-end Chinese hotels and restaurants.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big opportunity for us to enter this part of the market,\u201d said Rita Sourelah, a manager.\n\nThe expo also highlighted the blurring of lines as Chinese companies acquire U.S. and European brands and technology to sell at home.\n\nWeichai Group, a Chinese shipbuilder, displayed a luxury cabin cruiser made by Italy\u2019s Ferretti, in which Weichai bought a 75 percent stake in 2012.\n\nOther hybrid importers included Sweden\u2019s Volvo Cars, a unit of Chinese automaker Geely Holding; General Electric Appliances, acquired by China\u2019s Haier Group in 2016, and California-based solar supplier MiaSole, part of Beijing-based Hanergy Group.", "", "OXFORD, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Alonzo Smith ran for a pair of first-half touchdowns, and a safety in the second half helped Miami (Ohio) hold on for a 30-28 victory over Ohio on Wednesday night to keep its bowl eligibility alive.\n\nMiami (4-6, 4-2 Mid-American Conference) beat Ohio (6-4, 4-2) for the first time since 2012 to snap a five-game skid in the Battle of the Bricks.\n\nSmith finished with 94 yards on 20 carries.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull)\n\nCARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The agent for free agent Bryce Harper and many of baseball\u2019s top players claims rebuilding teams have become a \u201ccompetitive cancer\u201d that caused this season\u2019s 4 percent attendance drop.\n\nAs the sport\u2019s officials start to consider possible rules changes to spark offense and speed up play, Scott Boras acidly critiqued several clubs that were among the 17 to draw fewer fans this year than last.\n\nBoras pointed out Louisiana State\u2019s baseball team had a higher average attendance for its 37 home games than the Miami Marlins did for their 81 \u2014 10,786 to 10,014.\n\n\u201cThe fans of Florida have certainly brought the MIA to Miami,\u201d he said Wednesday in a courtyard outside the general managers\u2019 meetings.\n\nHe claimed when \u201cthe divisional clubs come to Minnesota, it\u2019s gotten so bad that only one of the Twins shows up.\u201d\n\nAnd he criticized the Toronto Blue Jays, who had the biggest decrease in the major leagues this year, falling by 878,000 fans to 2.33 million.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve lost near a third of their fan base due to the blue flu of not bringing attractive players the fans find interesting to their market,\u201d he said.\n\nBoras has self interest in encouraging spending, wanting fewer clubs jettisoning veterans in favor of youth and more handing out lucrative contracts \u2014 especially to his clients.\n\nMajor League Baseball\u2019s average attendance dropped to 28,830, its lowest since 2003 after 14 consecutive seasons topping 30,000, and six ballparks set record lows. Boras connected the drop to non-competitive clubs: There were three 100-loss teams for the second time since 1985 and the first since a record four in 2002. And there were eight 95-loss teams for the first time in big league history.\n\n\u201cThe reality of it is they\u2019re losing their fan base, and it costs millions and millions of dollars to rebuild the fan base,\u201d he said.\n\nBoras is seeking a record contract for Harper, topping outfielder Giancarlo Stanton\u2019s $325 million, 13-year deal through 2027 reached with the Miami Marlins, who traded him to the New York Yankees last December. Boras sounded as if he had rehearsed his zingers like a stand-up comedian.\n\n\u201cCertainly Harper\u2019s bazaar has begun,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fashionable. It\u2019s historical. It\u2019s elite. It\u2019s global, certainly. And certainly it has inspirations that deal with great shoes and great hair.\u201d\n\nWashington made a late-season offer before Harper became a free agent at the unusually young age of 26. Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said Harper didn\u2019t respond.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to go about his business and we\u2019re going to go about our business,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cWe drafted, signed, developed him. He turned into one of the best players in the league with our uniform on.\u201d\n\nWhile GMs meet with each other and agents, the formal sessions deal with the mechanics of the sport, and Commissioner Rob Manfred and his staff are concerned about the drop in offense and rise in strikeouts. The big league batting average fell seven points to .248, its lowest since 1972 \u2014 the last season before the American League adopted the designated hitter.\n\nStrikeouts set a record for the 11th straight year and topped hits for the first time in big league history.\n\n\u201cI think fans like the ball in play a little bit more,\u201d Chicago Cubs president of baseball operations Theo Epstein said. \u201cI embrace MLB\u2019s efforts to think about how to steer the game towards the most compelling product for the fans. If that involves the ball in play more, then you find some subtle ways to influence that.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles Angels general manager Billy Eppler doesn\u2019t think alterations are needed.\n\n\u201cI think we should embrace it. I don\u2019t think we should fight it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are people striking out more? Probably because pitchers are throwing about 3 1/2 miles an hour harder than they were seven years ago. People are getting better with their breaking ball. There\u2019s more technology in the game. And you can really accurately decide where you want to throw a baseball and practice that for particular hitters.\u201d\n\nAs many teams rotate the back end of their bullpens with their Triple-A teams to have more depth for each game, innings per starting pitcher dropped to 5.36 from 5.51 last year and 5.89 in 2012, and relievers per team per game rose to 3.4 from 3.2 last year and 3.0 in 2012. Tampa Bay started experimenting with a relief pitcher as an \u201copener\u201d instead of a traditional starter, a move adopted by Oakland and Milwaukee even in the playoffs.\n\nMore discussion is likely when owners meet next week in Atlanta, and the players\u2019 association appears open to at least consider changes \u2014 a stark change from its near-constant refusal in recent years. But first MLB must formulate what it wants to propose, a process likely to stretch through next month\u2019s winter meetings in Las Vegas and possibly into January.\n\n\u201cWe live in a time where we expect answers very quickly, and I think we have to remember that in baseball history there have been many different eras, many styles of baseball that have been played,\u201d Philadelphia GM Matt Klentak said. \u201cA dead-ball era occurs, and then teams begin to adjust their behavior, and all of a sudden you hit more home runs. And then teams adjust, and speed and defense takes over the game more. And then teams try to exploit all the PITCHf/x data and the TrackMan data. The game will naturally ebb and flow. To some degree we need to have patience with the game and let it evolve naturally. It will.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Bernie Wilson contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "VILLA PARK, Ill.

Boeing Co. says it has issued a safety bulletin that reiterates guidelines on how pilots should respond to erroneous data from an \"angle of attack\" sensor following last week's crash of a Boeing plane in Indonesia that killed 189 people. (AP Photo/Tatan Syuflana, File)\n\nJAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency airworthiness directive on how to handle erroneous data from a sensor that investigators believe malfunctioned on a new Boeing jet that plunged into the sea in Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board.\n\nThe directive gives regulatory weight to Boeing\u2019s safety bulletin that it sent to operators of Boeing 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 planes based on findings from the ongoing Indonesian investigation into the Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air jet. FAA directives are usually followed by other airline regulators internationally.\n\nThe FAA said erroneous data from the \u201cangle of attack\u201d sensor, which helps prevent the plane from stalling and diving, could cause flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane and lead to \u201cexcessive nose-down attitude, significant altitude loss, and possible impact with the terrain.\u201d\n\nThe directive instructs airlines to make specific changes to flight manual procedures for responding to the problem. Boeing\u2019s bulletin said it was directing flight crews to existing guidelines.\n\nIndonesian investigators on Wednesday said the sensor was replaced on the Lion Air plane the day before its fatal flight and may have compounded other problems with the aircraft.\n\nThe 2-month-old Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashed into the Java Sea 13 minutes after takeoff from Jakarta. Both that flight and its Oct. 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta had erratic speed and altitude shortly after takeoff.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Lion Air aborted a flight when one of its planes damaged a wing tip when it struck a lamp pole before takeoff from Bengkulu. The airline faulted the airport\u2019s aircraft movement control personnel who directed the plane from the apron to the taxiway.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s National Transportation Safety Committee earlier this week had said the plane that crashed had a malfunctioning airspeed indicator on its last four flights, based on analysis of the flight data recorder. Chairman Soerjanto Tjahjono said the airspeed indicator and sensor problems are related.\n\nLion Air\u2019s first two attempts to address the airspeed problem didn\u2019t work, and for the jet\u2019s second-to-last flight the \u201cangle of attack\u201d sensors were replaced, Tjahjono said.\n\nOn that Oct. 28 flight, from Bali to Jakarta, the pilot\u2019s and copilot\u2019s sensors disagreed by about 20 degrees. The plane went into a sudden dive minutes after takeoff, from which the pilots were able to recover.

He scored 19 points in the first half, then set picks and chased down offensive rebounds for teammates in the final two periods.\n\n\u201cAndre was the player of the game for me,\u201d Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. \u201cThe way he competed, just playing hard. Not one play was called for him, but he\u2019s not worried about touches.

Isaac missed 55 games his rookie year with ankle problems. He started the first eight Magic games this season, but missed the last three with another sprained ankle. He took some shots during practice Wednesday, is not expected to play for at least another week. \u201cIt\u2019s important we handle this the right way so it\u2019s not one of those things where he plays two games and it\u2019s sore and he has to miss one,\u201d Magic coach Steve Clifford said. \u201cHopefully he\u2019ll feel 100 percent and then just play injury free or pain free the rest of the season.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPistons: Finish a six-game trip at Atlanta on Friday night.\n\nMagic: Host Washington Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) \u2014 Chennedy Carter scored 22 points, Aaliyah Wilson and Kayla Wells combined for 34 and No. 20 Texas A&M defeated Rice 65-54 in the season opener for both teams on Wednesday night.\n\nCarter, last season\u2019s national freshman of the year, opened the scoring with a tip-in and scored the last four points from the foul line in a 13-1 start.

Yohai\u2019s name surfaced during the bank and tax fraud trial for Manafort, the former campaign chairman for Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Manafort has been convicted several federal crimes and agreed to cooperate with investigators in the Russia probe.\n\nThe case outlined against Yohai mentions the Russia probe, but in doing so appears to debunk Yohai\u2019s claims that he was also in discussions with the team headed by special counsel Robert Mueller and had turned on his former father-in-law.\n\nYohai mentioned in an unrelated New York civil case that he had missed court deadlines because of his involvement with the special counsel.

Warren, File)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Washington state voters rejected the nation\u2019s first tax on carbon emissions in the costliest initiative fight in state history. And they approved a ballot measure to block local governments from imposing new taxes on soda or grocery items.\n\nWith more than two million votes counted Wednesday, 56 percent of voters rejected Initiative 1631, the carbon pollution fee that was closely watched nationwide.\n\nThe measure would have charged large emitters an escalating fee starting at $15 per metric ton of emissions based on the carbon content of fossil fuels used or sold in the state or electricity generated within the state.\n\nAn estimated $2.3 billion in the first five years would have funded a range of programs aimed at cutting carbon pollution.\n\nMany experts said passage would show that states could take the lead on climate action even if the Trump administration doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe oil industry outspent carbon-fee supporters by 2-to-1. Oil companies led by BP America and Phillips 66 contributed most of $31 million raised in opposition. Opponents said the measure as an energy tax that would hurt consumers. Supporters raised about $15 million.\n\nDana Bieber, spokeswoman with the No on 1631 campaign, declared victory Tuesday night for \u201cworking families, consumers, small businesses and family farmers.\u201d She called the carbon fee an \u201ccostly, unfair and ineffective energy tax\n\nA coalition of tribes and environmental, community, labor and other groups collected more than 260,000 valid signatures to put the measure on the ballot. Proponents said polluters who release carbon emissions responsible for global warming should pay to address its impacts.\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee and actor Leonardo DiCaprio supported the measure while Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg each gave $1 million.\n\nNick Abraham, a spokesman for the Yes on 1631 campaign, said Wednesday afternoon that the coalition wants to move forward on climate action and may look to the legislative process.\n\n\u201cWe simply cannot quit the fight. This was a setback,\u201d said Fawn Sharp, president of the Quinault Nation, who worked with other Native American tribes to push the measure. She accused oil companies of hijacking the democratic process with record spending.\n\nThe election also saw big industry spending on other ballot measures including Initiative 1634, backed by the soda industry. The beverage industry targeted Washington state as part of a nationwide effort to stop the expansion of taxes on soda.\n\nI-1634 prohibits cities and counties from taxing soda or food products. The measure would not prevent the state Legislature from imposing taxes. Seattle\u2019s tax on soda and sugary beverages, approved last year, will remain in effect but can\u2019t be expanded.\n\nThe campaign sponsored by the American Beverage Association spent more than $20 million to pass it. The industry earlier won bans on new, local soda taxes in California, Arizona and Michigan. Opponents raised about $33,000.\n\nProponents said the tax hurts small businesses and working people.\n\nIn 2016, 59 percent of Washington state voters rejected a carbon tax that proposed using revenues to lower sales and business taxes, as well as provide rebates.\n\nSponsors of I-1631 tried again with a carbon fee that would pay for a wide range of projects aimed at cutting pollution and protecting the environment, such as solar power, zero-emissions vehicles and projects to improve forest health.\n\nIt also called for 35 percent of revenues to be spent in the most polluted census tracts, setting aside money to help workers in the fossil fuel industry transition to new jobs and requiring 10 percent to be spent on projects approved by American Indian tribes.\n\nKenneth Iverson, 64, a longshoreman from Tacoma, voted against the measure this month, calling it \u201cone more tax.\u201d\n\nBarry Rabe, a professor in the Gerald Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, said the Washington experience underscores the political difficulty of carbon taxes.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "", "", "RALEIGH, N.C.

Halfway through the season, his 31 catches and 410 yards receiving rank second among NFL rookie wide receivers behind only Atlanta\u2019s Calvin Ridley (33 catches, 463 yards). And Kirk has done it on a team that ranks last in the NFL in offense and next-to-last in passing offense.\n\n\u201cThis guy is the ultimate pro,\u201d coach Steve Wilks said. \u201cYou look at rookies coming in really trying to find their way. This guy works hard each and every day, trying to take care of his body, trying to prep himself. I think, really, the opportunities that he has been getting, he\u2019s taking advantage of them, meaning the throws, the catches. He\u2019s finishing those plays, which is great.\u201d\n\nIn his previous game, a week ago Sunday, Kirk broke free in the back of the end zone and caught a 9-yard touchdown pass from fellow rookie Josh Rosen with 34 seconds to play, the winning score in an 18-15 victory over San Francisco.\n\nThe Cardinals (2-6), who play at Kansas City (8-1) on Sunday, had last weekend off.\n\n\u201cI went back this week and actually watched the Washington game (the season opener),\u201d Kirk said, \u201cjust seeing where I was at then until now.

We hang out off the field. Football\u2019s a very social game, and I think sometimes we can pick each other up and get each other going whenever we might be sputtering a little bit. Football\u2019s a game of relationships, so it\u2019s good to have a strong one.\u201d\n\nKirk, after a standout career at Texas A&M, was drafted by Arizona in the second round, the 47th player chosen overall.

We felt like he had speed. I know that was a question: \u2018He\u2019s just a slot receiver.\u2019 (But) he\u2019s shown he can take the top off.\u201d\n\nRosen, who has his own thoughts about quarterbacks drafted ahead of him, said people sometimes look for the wrong things when evaluating a player.\n\n\u201cI think sometimes you just have to turn on tape and watch guys play,\u201d he said. \u201d(Kansas City\u2019s) Tyreek Hill on the other side is one of the best receivers in football right now, and he\u2019s tiny. He\u2019s unbelievable. I think they\u2019re different kinds of receivers, but just in the sense that I think a lot of guys look at the wrong things.

(AP Photo/Dita Alangkara)\n\nMOUNT KUMGANG, North Korea (AP) \u2014 The two-lane highway south from North Korea\u2019s Mount Kumgang into and across the Demilitarized Zone is lined by tall green fences and street lamps that are only turned on for special occasions. Children play on a parallel stretch of railroad that hasn\u2019t been in regular use since before they were born. Behind a solitary guard stands a sign saying it\u2019s 68 kilometers (40 miles) to Sokcho, a town just across the DMZ in South Korea.\n\nAt the height of South Korea\u2019s policy of engagement with the North, the \u201cDiamond Mountain Resort\u201d area was a symbol of cooperation. More than 2 million South Korean tourists came to visit and some of the South\u2019s biggest corporations poured more than a billion dollars into what they hoped would be a world-class travel destination.\n\nToday it\u2019s almost deserted.\n\nA decade after the North-South experiment in cooperation on Kumgang ended in bitter failure, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in want to give it another try. By the end of the year they hope to begin working on opening this stretch of road and rail.\n\nThe push to jointly develop Kumgang is a direct challenge to Washington\u2019s policy of maintaining sanctions and \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d until Pyongyang gives up its nuclear arsenal.\n\n___\n\nChrystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling of the Kumgangsan Hotel, where a handful of North Korean tourists in Adidas sweatsuits gathers to catch a bus up the mountain. Elaborate murals of mountain scenery cover the walls of its second floor. In the cavernous lobby, there\u2019s a souvenir shop, a white concert piano on a stage beside billiard and pingpong tables and a well-stocked bar. There\u2019s a theater and a karaoke room.\n\nThe hotel is eerily silent, the quiet broken only by the occasional laughter of the local tourists and some scattered Chinese groups.\n\nBuilt in the 1990s with hundreds of millions of dollars of South Korean investment, mostly from a branch of the Hyundai Group, the resort was in its heyday an oasis of luxury, with conga lines and Filipino lounge bands. Its 10 hotels featured opulent fixtures and oil paintings framed in gold. Guests had the run of an 18-hole golf course, now closed, and a hot springs spa, which remains open and popular with North Koreans. Today, the resort\u2019s main role is to be the official venue for reunions of families divided by the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nThe Kumgang project was troubled from its outset, when it opened to South Koreans in 1998.\n\nVisitors from the South were allowed only day trips or visits of a few days. Initially they were brought in by ferry to minimize chances to see the North\u2019s countryside or interact with its people. Later, they were allowed in on buses through the DMZ, with the curtains drawn until they had arrived.\n\nThe resort drew only a fraction of the 500,000 tourists projected to come annually. Within a few years of its opening, it was hemorrhaging money.\n\nIts fate was sealed in July 2008, when a North Korean soldier shot dead tourist Park Wang-ja, a 53-year-old housewife from Seoul, after she allegedly wandered into a restricted area on a beach on the resort\u2019s fringes. Seoul quickly suspended all travel to Kumgang. In 2011, the North announced it was seizing all assets and taking back control of all real estate rights.\n\nThe Hyundai affiliate is believed to have lost more than a billion dollars. Its Kumgang office sits padlocked and unoccupied near an arena that once housed a circus.\n\n___\n\nFrom their first summit in April, reopening the road and railway across the DMZ to Kumgang has been a top priority for Moon and Kim.\n\nMoon has helped bring Kim out of the cold. He wants to expand economic ties with the North to build trust and defuse tensions, creating conditions for Kim to dismantle his nuclear arsenal. He also hopes to reopen another \u201cSunshine\u201d era symbol, the jointly operated Kaesong industrial complex on the North\u2019s side of the DMZ.\n\nAt their third summit, in September, Kim and Moon formalized Mount Kumgang\u2019s role as the reunion venue, agreeing to \u201cpromptly restore the facility toward this end.\u201d Their joint statement included plans for a ground-breaking ceremony for work to reopen cross-border railways and roads, including the ones near Kumgang, by the year\u2019s end and to \u201cnormalize\u201d the Kaesong industrial complex and Mount Kumgang tourism projects when the time is ripe.\n\nMoon\u2019s seeming readiness to scale back sanctions even before Pyongyang takes major steps to denuclearize is raising red flags in Washington. Such concerns spiked when South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha suggested Seoul might lift unilateral sanctions it imposed after an 2010 attack on a South Korean warship that killed 46 sailors.\n\nTrump\u2019s response was quick and, to many Koreans, deeply insulting.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t do that without our approval,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do nothing without our approval.\u201d\n\nLim Soo-ho of the Seoul-based Institute for National Security said it\u2019s all but impossible for South Korea to resume joint tours to Kumgang, operations at the Kaesong joint factory park or any other form of economic cooperation under the current international sanctions, which have strengthened significantly since 2016. Washington\u2019s own sanctions against Pyongyang restrict an even broader range of economic activities and target a larger list of companies and individuals.\n\nSouth Korea will never abandon the Kumgang joint tours or Kaesong factory park because they are such powerful symbols of inter-Korean cooperation, Lim said. But a less risky business environment for southern companies is needed, perhaps with a free trade agreement that would bring inter-Korean economic activities closer to global standards.\n\nFor now, ground-breaking ceremonies for projects not yet started are the best Seoul and Pyongyang can manage.\n\n___\n\nA special permit is required to get to the beach from the base of the mountains.\n\nWinding through freshly harvested farmland, the rice still spread out on the roadsides to dry, travelers come to an imposing checkpoint manned by armed soldiers.

He had to revise that after seeing the Alps, and again after seeing Kumgang.\n\nThe sun is setting. Lights along the North-South demarcation line can be seen flickering in the hills.\n\nPae stops to point to the ocean.\n\n\u201cIf you look between those two little islands, you can see the South,\u201d she said. \u201cThere used to be so many tourists. It was very lively.\u201d\n\nAsked about her impressions of the South Koreans who came to visit or her hopes for the future, she hesitated. Those topics are still perhaps too sensitive and too political to discuss freely. After some thought she voiced a commonly heard refrain.\n\n\u201cWe Koreans are one people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is our common wish to be reunited.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP reporter Tong-hyung Kim contributed to this story from Seoul.

The survey of 138,929 registered voters was conducted Oct. 29 to Nov. 6, concluding as polls closed on Election Day.\n\nAP VoteCast combines interviews with a random sample of registered voters drawn from state voter files; with self-identified registered voters conducted using NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population; and with self-identified registered voters selected from nonprobability online panels. Interviews are conducted in English and Spanish. Respondents receive a small monetary incentive for completing the survey. Participants selected from state voter files are contacted by phone and mail, and have the opportunity to take the survey by phone or online.\n\nVoteCast National Survey\n\nThe VoteCast survey of voters and nonvoters nationwide is compiled from results of the 50 state-based surveys and a nationally representative survey of 4,913 registered voters conducted on the probability-based AmeriSpeak panel. It includes 40,692 probability interviews completed online and via telephone, and 93,324 nonprobability interviews completed online. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 0.5 percentage points for voters and 1.2 percentage points for nonvoters.\n\nVoteCast State Surveys\n\nIn 25 states, VoteCast is based on roughly 1,000 probability-based interviews conducted online and via phone, and roughly 3,000 nonprobability interviews conducted online. In these states, the margin of sampling error is estimated to be plus or minus 2.0 percentage points for voters and 5.0 percentage points for nonvoters.\n\nIn 25 additional states, VoteCast is based on between 475 and 1,000 nonprobability interviews conducted online. In these states, the margin of sampling error is estimated to be plus or minus 11.5 percentage points for voters and 15 percentage points for nonvoters.\n\nAlthough there is no statistically agreed upon approach for calculating margins of error for nonprobability samples, these margins of error are estimated using a calculation called the root mean squared error and other statistical adjustments. Unlike a standard error, a root mean square error does not easily translate into a traditional statistical confidence interval for the vote count for an individual candidate or the vote differential between two candidates. However, a mean square error is a measure of uncertainty that incorporates the variability associated with the poll estimates, as well as the bias associated with the estimates derived from a nonprobabilty sample.\n\nAs with all surveys, VoteCast is subject to multiple sources of error, including from sampling, question wording and order, and nonresponse.\n\nSampling Details\n\nProbability-based Registered Voter Sample\n\nIn each of the 25 states in which VoteCast includes a probability-based sample, NORC obtained a sample of registered voters from Catalist LLC \u2019s registered voter database. This database includes demographic information, as well as addresses and phone numbers for registered voters, allowing potential respondents to be contacted via mail and telephone. The sample was stratified by state, partisanship, age and race. In addition, NORC attempted to match sampled records to a registered voter database maintained by L2 , which provided additional phone numbers and demographic information. After the matching, NORC had phone numbers for 86 percent of sampled records, including cell phone numbers for 60 percent of records with a phone number. Prior to dialing, all probability sample records are mailed a postcard inviting them to complete the survey either online using a unique PIN or via telephone by calling a toll-free number. Postcards are addressed by name to the sampled registered voter if that individual is under age 35; postcards are addressed to \u201cregistered voter\u201d in all other cases. Telephone interviews are conducted with the adult that answers the phone following confirmation of registered voter status in the state.\n\nNonprobability Sample\n\nNonprobability participants are provided via the Harris Panel, including members of its third-party panels. Digital fingerprint software and panel-level ID validation is used to prevent respondents from completing the VoteCast survey multiple times.\n\nAmeriSpeak Sample\n\nDuring the initial recruitment phase of the AmeriSpeak panel, randomly selected U.S. households were sampled with a known, non-zero probability of selection from the NORC National Sample Frame and then contacted by U.S. mail, email, telephone and field interviewers (face-to-face). The panel provides sample coverage of approximately 97 percent of the U.S. household population. Those excluded from the sample include people with P.O. Box-only addresses, some addresses not listed in the USPS Delivery Sequence File and some newly constructed dwellings.\n\nWeighting Details\n\nVoteCast employs a four-step weighting approach that combines the probability sample with the nonprobability sample, and refines estimates at a subregional level within each state. The 50 state surveys and the AmeriSpeak survey are weighted separately and then combined into a survey representative of voters in all 50 states.\n\nState Surveys\n\nFirst, weights are constructed separately for the probability sample (when available) and the nonprobability sample for each state survey. These weights are adjusted to population totals to correct for demographic imbalances of the responding sample compared to the population of registered voters in each state. The adjustment targets are derived from a combination of data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s November 2016 Current Population Survey Voting and Registration Supplement, Catalist\u2019s voter file and the Census Bureau\u2019s 2017 American Community Survey . Prior to adjusting to population totals, the probability-based registered voter list sample weights are adjusted for differential non-response related to factors such as availability of phone numbers, age, race and partisanship.\n\nSecond, all nonprobability sample respondents receive a calibration weight. The calibration weight is designed to ensure the nonprobability sample is similar to the probability sample in regard to variables that are predictive of vote choice, such as partisanship or presidential approval, that cannot be fully captured through the prior demographic adjustments. For states that include probability samples, the calibration benchmarks are based on estimates from the probability-based registered voter list sample in that particular state. For states without probability samples, the calibration benchmarks are based on county level estimates from a multilevel regression and poststratification model that incorporates all probability and nonprobability cases nationwide.\n\nThird, all respondents in each state are weighted to improve estimates for substate geographic regions. This weight combines the weighted probability sample (if available) and the calibrated nonprobability sample, and then uses a small area model to improve the estimate within subregions of a state.\n\nFourth, the survey results are weighted to the actual vote count following the completion of the election. This weighting is done in 10-30 subregions within each state.\n\nNational Survey\n\nThe national survey is weighted to combine the 50 state surveys with the nationwide AmeriSpeak survey. Each of the state surveys is weighted as described. The AmeriSpeak survey receives a nonresponse-adjusted weight that is then adjusted to national totals for registered voters derived from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s November 2016 Current Population Survey Voting and Registration Supplement, the Catalist voter file and the Census Bureau\u2019s 2017 American Community Survey. The state surveys are further adjusted to represent their appropriate proportion of the registered voter population for the country and combined with the AmeriSpeak survey. After all votes are counted, the national data file is adjusted to match the national vote for members of the U.S. House of Representatives within each state.", "Recent editorials from Alabama newspapers:\n\n___\n\nNov. 7\n\nThe Decatur Daily says it is time for Americans to remember their unified belief in a democratic process is more important than the boxes they checked on the Nov. 6 ballot:\n\nFinally it\u2019s over.\n\nAt least until the next election heats up, we will get a respite from mailboxes filled with flyers, endless advertisements demonizing the other side, and social media posts proclaiming one party or one candidate offers the only solution.\n\nThe acrimony leading up to Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections too often was a function of deliberate oversimplification. Our state and nation face complex problems that are resistant to easy solutions. Simple fixes would already have been accomplished; the low-hanging branches already are bare. The remaining problems are inherently difficult, requiring level-headed input from multiple perspectives.\n\nThe intensity of this election was disturbing, but also a good sign.\n\nAmericans get worked up because we care. We are passionate in our desire to improve the state and nation. And we believe in democracy. We believe our vote matters not just to short-term outcomes, but to the long-term viability of the American experiment in self-governance.\n\nWhile passionate advocacy has been an essential element of our nation\u2019s greatness, so has the willingness to abide by the decisions of the majority. Every contested race on Tuesday\u2019s ballot resulted in winners and losers.\n\nIt is incumbent on the winners to accept victory with humility.\n\nThe heavier burden is upon losers. They are frustrated today, and the temptation is to reject the system that dismissed their preferences.\n\nBut it is the system, far more than particular candidates or issues, that defines our nation. Our representative democracy \u2014 to paraphrase Winston Churchill \u2014 is the worst form of government except for all the others. It is chaotic and nasty, brutal and inefficient.\n\nFor all its rough edges, however, our system of government eventually points us in the right direction. We stumble and backtrack, careen to the left and right, but our nation\u2019s history is one of progress.\n\nThe losers in Tuesday\u2019s election \u2014 and most people who voted lost at least one race \u2014 need to step back. Beyond the barrage of tribal campaigning, can we see merit in the candidate or position we opposed?\n\nEven if the answer is no, we should respect the system that allowed us to have a voice. Those convinced the election outcome was harmful have time to better articulate their message before the next election.\n\nOur system is built on immense confidence in the citizenry.\n\nWe are trusted to both engage in the conflict of campaigns and accept disappointing results with equanimity. We are trusted to express our opinions with energy, but to reserve our greatest loyalty to a democratic process that often rejects our viewpoints.\n\n...\n\nOnline: https://www.decaturdaily.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 7\n\nThe Cullman Times on Garlan Gudger preparing to enter his new role as an Alabama State Senator:\n\nAfter 14 years of service to the City of Cullman, Garlan Gudger is preparing to take the skills that made him successful at home to the often contentious halls of state government.\n\nAs a state senator, representing District 4, Gudger will no doubt face the challenges that have kept Alabama on a political roller coaster for many years.\n\nThe scandalous end of Gov. Robert Bentley, the indictment and conviction of House Speaker Mike Hubbard and others, and the odd departure to Washington by Attorney General Luther Strange, via the U.S. Senate appointment from the governor he was investigating, are just a few of the events that have eroded public confidence and diluted the ability of state government to move Alabama forward.\n\nGudger, however, prepares to arrive in Montgomery in early 2019 with a reputation of being willing to sit down and talk with the people he serves as well as those he governed alongside in Cullman. For 10 of the 14 years on the Cullman City Council, he was designated president and provided valuable leadership through a few difficult years and a lot of progressive years of growth.\n\nThe key in Cullman\u2019s leadership in recent years has been the ability of council members and mayors to agree and disagree, but find common ground for the good of the residents they serve. That type of statesmanship, which serves well at any level of government, is often non-existent in Montgomery and Washington, D.C.\n\nSo, there is the challenge going forward. Gudger has shown the ability to reach out to others to find solutions and move forward.\n\nAlabama has multiple pending issues that are continually pushed from one session to the next. How can the state improve workforce availability and training? What is the answer to dangerously overcrowded prisons? Why are the people not allowed to vote on something as simple as a lottery? Can internet service be brought to areas that are far behind in technology? How can schools become more consistent and effective across the state? Can the rigid funding formulas maintained in Alabama be untangled to better fund services? Will infrastructure improvements be funded?\n\nLower unemployment is Alabama\u2019s shining characteristic at the moment. But all of the aforementioned questions weigh into the long-term viability of the state. Improved roads, better education, increased revenue and greater technology will create great opportunities.\n\nBringing Alabama to a higher performance level is not the job of one person. This should be a team effort of the Legislature working with the governor, even when there are disagreements. We are confident Reps. Randall Shedd and Corey Harbison will work closely with Gudger as he begins his tenure in Montgomery.\n\nWhile Gudger\u2019s presence and performance will be missed at the local level, we anticipate he will bring his endless spirit of cooperation and leadership to the Alabama Senate. Good luck, Garlan.\n\nOnline: https://www.cullmantimes.com/\n\n___\n\nNov. 7\n\nDothan Eagle on elections in Alabama:\n\nAll the conjecture about an impending \u201cblue wave\u201d spreading across Alabama meant little to most of the state\u2019s voters, who sent GOP candidates into offices across the state by margins of at least 2 to 1.\n\nThat\u2019s no surprise; Alabama\u2019s conservatism is legendary. There\u2019s a reason many consider the election of Doug Jones to the U.S. Senate an aberration; while there was a time that a Republican candidate wouldn\u2019t have had a chance at election, today it\u2019s the Democrats who struggle to mount a successful run.\n\nNot that it\u2019s impossible. State Rep. Dexter Grimsley, a Democrat from Henry County, bested GOP challenger Ron Wilson to be elected to another term on Tuesday, and unchallenged Houston County Commissioner Curtis Harvey was returned to office, both likely on the strength of incumbency. Henry County Sheriff Will Maddox, a Democrat, also retained his office, holding off GOP challenger Jay Henry.\n\nOther local Republicans breezed in without a fight; most local offices held by GOP officials were unchallenged, and those that were easily defeated challengers.\n\n...\n\nWe offer our congratulations to the winners, and condolences to those who didn\u2019t prevail. ...\n\nOnline: https://www.dothaneagle.com/", "Sen.

Claire McCaskill on Tuesday.\n\nVoter surveys and election results show McCaskill did well where she needed to in St. Louis, Kansas City and their suburbs as well as in Boone County, home of the University of Missouri-Columbia.\n\nBut her support tanked in rural Missouri, despite constant work to court those voters in a state Trump won by nearly 19 percentage points in 2016.\n\nMcCaskill\u2019s loss in the small towns of Missouri illustrates an often-overlooked flip side to the growing Democratic national dominance of major cities and the much-discussed inroads of Democrats in the suburbs. Republicans have ramped up their margins in rural America since Trump took office.\n\nBoth those trends were on display Tuesday in Missouri. For example, in a House race in the St. Louis suburbs, Republican Rep. Ann Wagner saw her margin of victory this year decline to 4 percentage points from more than 20 points in 2016 and 32 in 2014.\n\nBut Hawley, the state\u2019s attorney general, countered McCaskill\u2019s strength with urban voters by stressing that she no longer represented what he called the values of Missouri. He hammered her as too liberal for the state, noting her vote against tax cuts, and especially her opposition to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nMcCaskill held more than 50 town halls in mostly in Republican strongholds, and during the campaign she tried to limit her losses in rural areas by noting that she voted with Trump nearly half the time in the Senate. She gave an interview to Fox News, unusual for a Democrat, and decried \u201ccrazy Democrats\u201d who harass Republicans in restaurants and other public places.\n\nRural and small town voters favored Hawley 66 percent to 31 percent, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the American electorate.\n\nUniversity of Missouri-St. Louis political scientist David Kimball said the state has moved right since McCaskill first won election to the Senate in 2006. Now, at least for statewide races, he said Missouri is \u201csolid red.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t say she ignored rural Missouri,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cShe tried. She made her pitch. I think many voters just weren\u2019t receptive.\u201d\n\nWhen McCaskill first won election to the Senate in 2006 \u2014 another midterm year \u2014 she was able to chip away at Republican strongholds, this year she performed significantly worse in rural Missouri.\n\nAn Associated Press analysis of the 2006 and 2018 county-by-county election results shows McCaskill lost ground in every rural county.\n\nIn Reynolds County in the state\u2019s southeastern Bootheel region, McCaskill dropped nearly 27 percentage points compared to when she first ran. In 2006, she edged out former Republican rival Sen. Jim Talent with about 53 percent of the vote in the county. This year, she only brought in 27 percent of the vote.\n\nMcCaskill\u2019s loss of popularity in rural Missouri demonstrates the growing strength of the Republican Party in a state once considered a presidential bellwether. Republicans now control the state Legislature and almost every statewide seat. When McCaskill leaves office, there will be only one Democrat left serving statewide.\n\nTrump capitalized on his strength with rural, working-class, white voters in Missouri by making campaign stops in Cape Girardeau the day before the election and a September rally in Springfield.\n\nMcCaskill outperformed Hawley in urban areas, where 67 percent of voters favored her, and in suburban Missouri \u2014 52 percent of voters favored her there, according to AP VoteCast.\n\nShe had a good lead with both urban men and women. Among suburbanites, McCaskill won over women \u201460 percent\u2014 while Hawley was modestly favored among men \u2014 53 percent to 44 percent.\n\nShe still lost statewide by 6 percentage points.\n\n___\n\nThis version of the story corrects the spelling of Rep.

(AP) \u2014 It\u2019s become clear through the first half of this season the Seattle Seahawks offense functions best when running back Chris Carson is getting the bulk of the carries.\n\nYet it\u2019s also becoming clear that Carson may be a spectator on Sunday when the Seahawks face the Los Angeles Rams as he deals with a hip injury that could keep him sidelined for the second time this season.\n\nSeattle coach Pete Carroll said Wednesday that Carson would not practice and his status for Sunday\u2019s NFC West matchup was uncertain. Carson started last Sunday\u2019s 25-17 loss to the Chargers and averaged 5.0 yards per carry, but did not play the final 2\u00bd quarters after a lingering hip issue flared up.\n\nWhile there is a chance Carson could be ready by Sunday, the Seahawks (4-4) also turn around and play a Thursday night game against Green Bay next week. And playing Carson on Sunday may make him unavailable against the Packers, which could end up being a more important game for Seattle\u2019s playoff hopes.\n\n\u201cThe soft tissue thing is kind of hanging with him a little bit,\u201d Carroll said of Carson. \u201cThis hip thing is still kind of there and we\u2019ve got to wait and see how it comes out at the end of the week.\u201d\n\nCarson has shown he\u2019s the best option as Seattle\u2019s primary running back when he is healthy. In the four games Carson has carried the ball at least 14 times this season, he\u2019s averaging 4.2 yards per carry, 95.5 yards per game and the Seahawks are 3-1 in those four games.\n\nIn the three games where Carson has carried the ball fewer than 14 times either because of injury or game plan, the Seahawks are winless.\n\nIf Carson can\u2019t play against the Rams, Mike Davis would likely get the bulk of the work at running back with a bigger role for rookie first-round pick Rashaad Penny as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got plenty of guys we can go to,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to just rely on one guy right now.\u201d\n\nDavis has shown an ability to be the primary ball carrier for the Seahawks, running for 101 yards on 21 carries in Seattle\u2019s Week 4 victory over Arizona when Carson was out because of an unrelated groin injury. Davis had 62 yards on 15 carries last week carrying the bulk of the running after Carson was unable to continue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I do every week, prepare that I\u2019m going to be the starter so if it does come up I don\u2019t get blindsided,\u201d Davis said.\n\nDavis has proven he can handle the load. The same can\u2019t be said of Penny, who has just 42 carries for 146 yards through eight games. In the first couple of weeks, Seattle made it a priority to force Penny into the game and get him some action. After they realized that wasn\u2019t working, Penny disappeared for a couple of weeks before slowly being reintegrated to the offense.\n\nLast week Penny had just four carries, but may see that number increase significantly if Carson can\u2019t play.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to get him out there. He just needs more turns,\u201d Carroll said of Penny. \u201cMike has been very versatile in the throwing game and all the styles of runs, really good at it and very effective. We\u2019re just going with what looks right. It has nothing to do with where you got picked or where you came from for the opportunities to present itself for the guys to show what they can do.\u201d\n\nWhoever is carrying the ball, the Seahawks will want to replicate the success they had from the first meeting with the Rams. Seattle rushed for a season-high 190 yards in the 33-31 loss, the most allowed by Los Angeles this season. But Carson was a big part of that success, running for 116 yards.\n\nDavis expects the Rams to make changes, but also believes in his offensive line.\n\n\u201cWe know what our guys can do up front and they\u2019re killing it. I have no doubt,\u201d Davis said.\n\nNOTES: G D.J. Fluker didn\u2019t finish last week\u2019s game with a calf injury and sat out practice on Wednesday. Carroll said Fluker was a little more sore on Wednesday than he was earlier in the week. ... S Bradley McDougald also didn\u2019t practice with a knee injury that kept him out the second half against the Chargers. Delano Hill would start if McDougald can\u2019t play.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Governor-elect Tony Evers, left, and Lt.

(Steve Apps/Wisconsin State Journal via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 This week\u2019s midterm elections offered revealing lessons for both parties as battle lines begin to emerge for the 2020 presidential election.\n\nFor Democrats, a string of statewide victories in Rust Belt states opened a potential path back to the White House. But President Donald Trump\u2019s Republican Party found strength in critical states that often hold the keys to the presidency.\n\nPerhaps no state offered Democrats more hope than Wisconsin, which shocked the party in 2016 by narrowly falling into Trump\u2019s column. Republican Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s narrow loss in his bid for a third term left Democrats optimistic they could reclaim Wisconsin along with other traditionally blue states that Trump carried, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cTo have Walker lose is a significant turning point that the right candidate in 2020 could win all of these states\u201d across the industrial north, Democratic pollster Paul Maslin, who advised Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin\u2019s campaign. \u201cIf they do, Trump\u2019s map starts to get more difficult.\u201d\n\nStill, there are plenty of reasons for caution for Democrats. Gains in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania were offset by mixed results in Ohio and GOP dominance in electoral powerhouse Florida.\n\nIn Ohio, Republicans came out on top in the governor\u2019s race and a handful of other statewide offices. The GOP kept their 12-4 majority in the U.S. House delegation.\n\nOhio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, who won another term representing a district that Hillary Clinton won in 2016, called it a \u201creally bad election night\u201d for his party. But he said Democrats were able to win when they focused on \u201cbread-and-butter economic issues,\u201d the way he and Sen. Sherrod Brown, who also won re-election Tuesday, did.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not connecting with the workers, then you\u2019re not going to be able to do well,\u201d Ryan said in an interview. \u201cTrump connected to the workers. If we don\u2019t do that, if we\u2019re continuing to be seen as elite and that people are \u2018deplorables\u2019 if they don\u2019t vote for us, we\u2019re going to have a big problem.\u201d\n\nIn his victory speech, Brown said his state had provided a \u201cblueprint for America in 2020.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, though, pointed to Trump\u2019s 8-point victory in Ohio in 2016, and the four campaign visits he made to the state, including a southwest Ohio jaunt three weeks before the election. Trump remains very popular in the region, spanning from the politically swing-voting Hamilton County eastward along a string of Ohio River counties that the president carried by more than 30 percentage points.\n\nThe area\u2019s white and vastly rural profile outside Cincinnati is part of what is expected to keep Ohio from springing back easily for Democrats, Hamilton County Republican Chairman Alex Triantafilou said.\n\n\u201cI think southwest Ohio is becoming more reliably red under President Trump,\u201d Triantafilou said. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a turnout benefit to talking to conservatives the way Trump has.\u201d\n\nThere were also warning signs for Democrats in Florida, a perennial swing state that is increasingly delivering victories \u2014 however narrow \u2014 to the GOP. Republican Ron DeSantis defeated Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, handing Democrats their third consecutive loss for the Florida governor\u2019s mansion. Adding to their trouble was incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson trailing Republican Rick Scott.\n\nOne bright note for Democrats in Florida was the passage of Amendment 4, which will restore voting rights to most felons when they complete their sentences and probation, adding 1.4 million possible voters to the rolls. It\u2019s unclear how this group of people will affect the 2020 election.\n\nDemocrats also see bright signs in places like Nevada, once a conservative state that is now more consistently trending blue. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Democratic campaign for Senate in Texas fell short by less than 3 percentage points in Texas, a GOP-heavy state that hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1994. And Democrat Stacey Abrams ran a competitive campaign for governor in Georgia, which hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat to the governor\u2019s mansion since 1998.\n\n\u201cThere are some assumptions about states Democratic presidential candidates will visit that are being truly reconsidered,\u201d Democratic strategist Anita Dunn said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about changing the map.\u201d\n\nTensions were already flaring over what type of candidate could capitalize on the emerging 2020 map.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a huge field, but the big question will be whether they learn lessons from the midterms because I think the electorate was trying to tell us something loudly and clearly,\u201d Matt Bennett of Third Way, a centrist think tank, said in an interview. \u201cThe message they were trying to send us is you\u2019ve got to beat Trump in the battleground states, and you\u2019ve got to run on very mainstream, nonextreme Democratic ideals and values.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people that ran that way won in those tough places,\u201d Bennett added, \u201cand the people who didn\u2019t run that way lost almost everywhere.\u201d\n\nBut Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said he saw a shifting center of gravity within the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cThanks to Stacey Abrams, Andrew Gillum and Beto O\u2019Rourke, places where Democrats have had trouble winning for years became unpredictable toss-ups in large part because of an electorate inspired by never-before-heard bold visions for economic and racial justice,\u201d Green said.", "FILE - In this Dec. 4, 2017 file photo, people walk by Google offices in New York.

(AP Photo/John Locher)\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 A female political movement driven by backlash to President Donald Trump kicked off the year with a women\u2019s march in Nevada. Eleven months later, that activism helped women win key races across the state, including ousting an incumbent U.S. senator, electing a female-majority federal delegation and leaving the state poised for a potential female-majority Assembly.\n\nNevada Democratic women running in statewide and federal races emphasized diversity and the need to protect health care, abortion rights and a social safety net. They were also helped in the battleground state by a network of female-driven political activism.\n\n\u201cPlenty of people had their doubts that this victory would be ours tonight, but this is the story of this election cycle: Women stepping up to lead, to take back our country and take back the agenda in Washington,\u201d Democrat Jacky Rosen declared in her victory speech Tuesday after winning the U.S. Senate race in Nevada.\n\nRosen, a first-term congresswoman who ousted incumbent Republican Sen. Dean Heller, becomes the state\u2019s second-ever female U.S. senator and will serve alongside Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who was elected the nation\u2019s first Latina senator in 2016.\n\nRosen, a former computer programmer and synagogue president from the Las Vegas area, included female-focused messages on the campaign trail and highlighted Heller\u2019s alliance with the president and his eventual support for GOP plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nShe also condemned Heller\u2019s support for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and his characterization of the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh as \u201csmears\u201d and a \u201chiccup\u201d in the confirmation process.\n\nHeller held a modest lead among Nevada\u2019s male voters, but Rosen was preferred decisively among women \u2014 57 percent to 38 percent, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of the American electorate.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, high-profile Democratic women and potential 2020 presidential candidates, campaigned on Rosen\u2019s behalf, as did abortion-rights groups like NARAL Pro-Choice America, Planned Parenthood and Emily\u2019s List.\n\nAcross the country, a record number of women were elected to the U.S. House, including its first two female Muslim members. A record number of 237 women ran for the House as major-party candidates, and 16 women ran for governor.\n\nThe surge in female candidates this cycle comes almost two years after an outpouring of women marched in the nation\u2019s capital and around the country in opposition to Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nActivists behind the Women\u2019s March decided to move their January 2018 march to Las Vegas, saying Nevada\u2019s role as a strategic swing state that Democrat Hillary Clinton won in 2016 made it prime proving ground for turning the activism into political change.\n\nThey pledged to register 1 million voters and elect more progressive candidates across the country. In Nevada, activists and groups involved in the march worked to build momentum for Rosen and other female candidates.\n\nVoters in Nevada picked another female Democrat, education philanthropist Susie Lee, to replace Rosen, and incumbent Democratic Rep. Dina Titus cruised to an easy re-election, putting women in four of the state\u2019s six seats in the U.S. House and Senate.\n\n\u201cWomen were motivated to get the polls,\u201d Lee told The Associated Press on Wednesday. \u201cWhether it was seeing that this Congress is so dysfunctional and broken, but more importantly, stripping away protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\u201d\n\nShe also said protecting Medicare and Social Security, finding a path for young \u201cDreamer\u201d migrants to stay in the U.S. permanently and finding solutions to gun violence \u201care all incredibly important to women, especially mothers.\u201d\n\nJerry Lamb, an independent voter in Henderson, said he voted for Lee over Republican Danny Tarkanian in Nevada\u2019s 3rd Congressional District partly because he thinks it\u2019s good to have more women in elected office.\n\n\u201cI think we just need more women in politics, to balance it,\u201d the 72-year-old manager said. \u201cThey\u2019re more reasonable, and I think they can work across party lines a little bit better. I think their egos aren\u2019t as bad as ours.\u201d\n\nNevada voters on Tuesday picked Democrat Kate Marshall for state lieutenant governor.\n\nWomen were on the path to potentially make history in the Nevada Legislature by outnumbering their male counterparts.\n\nTwo female Assembly candidates and another woman seeking a state Senate seat were competing in races that were so tight, the AP has not been able to declare a winner. Should all three win and a woman be appointed to at least one of several House and Senate seats being vacated by men, Nevada would become the first state with a female-majority legislature.\n\nWomen picked up two seats on the Nevada Supreme Court on Tuesday, marking the first time in state history that women made up a majority of the state\u2019s high court, Nevada Supreme Court spokesman Michael Sommermeyer confirmed.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "The weekly fishing report as compiled for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department for Nov. 7 and also available on the internet at http://www.txfishing.com :\n\nCENTRAL\n\nAUSTIN: Water stained; 65-71 degrees; 0.5 feet low.

(AP Photo/Bob Leverone, File)\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Randall Cobb is out of detailed answers for now.\n\nBut the veteran receiver did have one simple solution to get the Green Bay Packers out of their first-half funk.\n\nNo rallying cries. No inspirational slogans, like the \u201cRun the Table\u201d phrase from Rodgers that turned into catchword of the Packers\u2019 comeback from a 4-6 start in 2016.\n\n\u201cYeah, win a game. Win a game you get going,\u201d Cobb said after practice on Wednesday when asked if there were lessons to draw from two years ago.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to win one right now,\u201d the veteran said.\n\nThe Packers aren\u2019t quite yet in such dire straits as in 2016. But at 3-4-1, Green Bay has little margin for error if they want to avoid a second straight season without the playoffs.\n\nThird place in the NFC North behind the division-leading Bears (5-3) and second-place Vikings (5-3-1) isn\u2019t going to cut it. A bounce-back second half can start Sunday when the Miami Dolphins visit Lambeau Field.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to be at home. You have to take care of your home-field advantage,\u201d coach Mike McCarthy said. \u201cWe also know what\u2019s coming after it, too.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a quick turnaround back on the road after the Dolphins game with a Thursday night trip to Seattle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to be home and I can\u2019t remember the last time, it\u2019s been a while since we played there,\u201d McCarthy added.\n\nThat would be in Week 6 on Oct. 15 over the San Francisco 49ers, a closer-than-expected, 33-30 victory that required the Packers to score 10 points over the final 1:55.\n\nFollowing a bye, the Packers had trouble closing out road games the next two weeks, albeit in losses to two of the league\u2019s best teams in the Rams and Patriots.\n\nLast week, running back Aaron Jones\u2019 fumble on the first play of the fourth quarter in New England territory was a turning point. The Patriots went on to sandwich two touchdown drives around a three-and-out for Green Bay.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost games before here. But this just feels different,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t feel good. It\u2019s not fun. But we\u2019ve got to figure something out.\u201d\n\nAsked how this felt different, Cobb didn\u2019t have any specifics.\n\n\u201cI wish I could. If I could then I would try to correct that \u2018how,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cAt this point, we\u2019re not where we should be and where we want to be. We\u2019ve got to figure out how to get there.\u201d\n\nAt least quarterback Aaron Rodgers seems to be getting better each week from the left knee injury suffered in the season opener against Chicago.\n\nHe seems to be moving around much better. Last week against New England, he didn\u2019t have to wear a sleeve or brace on the knee.\n\n\u201cJust grit,\u201d Rodgers said. He was a full participant in a practice on Wednesday that was abbreviated by McCarthy in part because of the wear following two straight long road trips.\n\nRodgers has had a dip in his completion rate this year, at 60.6 percent through eight games, down from his career average of 64.8 percent. Rodgers said it had to do with \u201can unnatural amount of throwaways this year,\u201d referring to passes thrown out of bounds or out of the defense\u2019s reach if he can\u2019t find an open receiver.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep finding ways to get guys into one or two spots, open on time,\u201d Rodgers said, \u201cand when they\u2019re open, I\u2019ve got to make the throws.\u201d\n\nThe Packers lost 29-27 against the then-unbeaten Rams a couple of weeks ago. In that game, Ty Montgomery, who has since been traded , fumbled a late kickoff after being directed to stay in the end zone for a touchback. The turnover deprived Rodgers a chance to drive for a game-winning score.\n\nLosing hasn\u2019t been fun.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s happy about the position we\u2019re in. So, yeah, I just want to have fun again,\u201d Cobb said with a smile and slight chuckle.\n\nNOTES: WR Trevor Davis, who has been on injured reserve since the start of the season with a hamstring injury, has returned to practice. He could be in line to be activated for the Nov. 15 game against Seattle to help replace injured wideout Geronimo Allison (groin). ... Limited in practice on Tuesday were S Kentrell Brice and RT Bryan Bulaga, who have knee injuries, and LB Blake Martinez (ankle).\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "", "BILLINGS, Mont.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull)\n\nCARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Months before the start of spring training, the New York Yankees\u2019 injury list is lengthening.\n\nCatcher Gary Sanchez had surgery on his left shoulder Thursday, which could slow him during spring training but is not likely to keep him out of the lineup on opening day.\n\n\u201cHis shoulder has bothered him off and on since \u201917,\u201d Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s been treated conservatively with it. He had an injection towards the end of \u201917. He had two in \u201918. He just resumed workouts and still felt a little bit lingering from it.\u201d\n\nCashman made the announcement at the general managers\u2019 meetings, hours after the Yankees finalized an $8 million, one-year contract with CC Sabathia. The 38-year-old left-hander said 2019 will be his final season.\n\nNew York announced last month that Didi Gregorius will miss much of next season after Tommy John surgery to repair a torn ligament in the shortstop\u2019s right elbow.\n\nAn All-Star in 2017 who slumped badly this year, Sanchez felt continued shoulder pain while working out last week at the Yankees\u2019 minor league complex in Tampa, Florida, with strength and conditioning coach Matt Krause.\n\n\u201cHe said things are going well, but my shoulder is still cranky. It\u2019s still lingering in there,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cSo it\u2019s just enough complaints, too many over the course of a year-and-half now.\u201d\n\nHead team physician Dr. Christopher Ahmad performed a debridement at New York-Presbyterian Hospital to remove loose debris from Sanchez\u2019s non-throwing shoulder. The recovery is expected to be about three months.\n\nSanchez, 25, hit .299 with 20 homers and 42 RBIs two years ago, when he impressed during a call-up in the season\u2019s final two months, and he was an All-Star in 2017 who hit .278 with 33 homers and 90 RBIs in 122 games. But he slumped to a .186 with 18 homers and 53 RBIs in 89 games this year, when he was limited by a groin injury, and his defense was poor for the second straight year.\n\n\u201cIt may very well have been something that affected him performance-wise. I can\u2019t rule that out,\u201d Cashman said.\n\nSabathia went 9-7 with a 3.65 ERA in 29 starts this year. He met with Cashman in the Yankees clubhouse the day after New York\u2019s season ended.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Cash I want to play again. I will play somewhere else if I have to. But I don\u2019t want to play anywhere else. I\u2019m a Yankee. I want to end as a Yankee.

Governor-elect Jeanette Nunez, third right, after thanking the crowd Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Orlando, Fla. DeSantis defeated Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum. (Chris Urso/Tampa Bay Times via AP)\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida Democrats tried something new and got the same result, losing the sixth straight governor\u2019s race, possibly losing all three Cabinet seats on Tuesday\u2019s ballot and winding up with a Senate race that\u2019s too close to call.\n\nIn short, the Democrats\u2019 blue wave hit President Donald Trump\u2019s figurative red wall, and once again Florida maintained its reputation for close elections \u2014 with Republicans having the edge.\n\nRepublican Ron DeSantis defeated Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by less than a percentage point and three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson was hoping a recount would reverse Republican Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s narrow lead.\n\n\u201cIt seems like we\u2019re living up to our history,\u201d said Bob Poe, who was Florida\u2019s Democratic Party chairman during the 2000 presidential recount. \u201cFlorida was just being Florida.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s results could help Trump when he seeks re-election in 2020, with DeSantis and Scott in a better position to use their offices to sway opinions if they maintain support with Florida voters. And while Republicans swept Florida\u2019s statewide races, Democrats again crept closer to winning, and may get a boost going forward from a new constitutional amendment that will restore felons\u2019 voting rights.\n\nBut for now, Republicans maintain their dominance in Florida \u2014 even if by the slimmest of margins.\n\nFor the third straight governor race, a Republican won without winning half the statewide vote. In the Senate race, Scott led Nelson by more than 30,000 votes out of more than 8.1 million cast.\n\nThe Cabinet seat of agriculture commissioner was also too close to call after Republican state Rep. Matt Caldwell led Democrat Nikki Fried by 12,501 votes of nearly 8 million cast \u2014 below the 0.25 percentage-point difference that can trigger a hand recount of ballots.\n\n\u201cThis is the closest race we\u2019ve seen here in Florida since Bush v. Gore in 2000 \u2014 we\u2019re heading into a recount,\u201d Fried tweeted Wednesday morning.\n\nThat was George W. Bush\u2019s 537-vote Florida victory over Al Gore, a race that decided the presidency and took five weeks to sort out.\n\nFlorida\u2019s election was largely a referendum on Trump. DeSantis\u2019 primary campaign was based almost entirely on his and Trump\u2019s mutual admiration. And while Democrats despise the president, Republicans love him. He came to Florida twice in the final six days of the election to encourage his base to show up for DeSantis and Scott.\n\nIt may have made the difference, and now DeSantis will be in a position to return the favor. Florida\u2019s 29 electoral college votes will be critical to Trump\u2019s re-election and having a sitting Republican governor will help.\n\nDemocrats did much better in heavily Democratic counties than they did four years ago when Scott defeated former Gov. Charlie Crist, said University of North Florida political science professor Matthew Corrigan, who was part of The Associated Press team analyzing returns Tuesday night.\n\nBroward County turnout rose from 44 percent in the last midterm election to 57 percent this year. Similarly, Miami-Dade County increased turnout from 50 percent to 57 percent.\n\nBut Republicans amped up their turnout even more, Corrigan said. Sumpter County is home to The Villages, an enormous retirement community that overwhelmingly votes Republican. Turnout increased from 67 to 77 percent.\n\n\u201cBasically, the increase in turnout was across the board, but in some of these really Republican counties it was higher,\u201d Corrigan said.\n\nLongtime Tallahassee-based Republican political consultant David Johnson said that while the GOP again dominated at the polls, the state is still purple.\n\n\u201cThey turned out the vote very, very well. We just turned out a few more,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhen it comes to the midterms, we know who our voters are and we know what we need to do to get them out and we do it. It\u2019s more execution than it is a grand strategy.\u201d\n\nIn the Senate race, Scott did what works for him: He spent more than $60 million of his own money to saturate the state with television and online ads and stuck to a very tight script. While Nelson easily won re-election in 2006 and 2012, he faced nothing like he did with Scott.\n\nScott repeatedly hit the theme that Nelson was a confused, do-nothing senator who has made a career in Washington toeing the party line. He also highlighted Florida\u2019s improved economy under his watch and depicted himself as a strong leader through devastating hurricanes.\n\nFlorida Democrats\u2019 strategy in midterm elections has been to nominate a moderate, white candidate from the central part of the state while targeting their turnout effort to the party\u2019s South Florida stronghold and along the Interstate 4 corridor that runs from Daytona Beach in the east to Tampa Bay in the west.\n\nBut this year, Gillum was the party\u2019s nominee. He was the first African-American to be nominated for governor, and he ran as an unabashed liberal. His plan was to excite younger voters, minorities and the wing of the party that calls themselves progressives \u2014 groups that usually turn out in lower numbers in non-presidential election years.\n\nAnd he also refused to focus just on Democrat-rich counties in the southeast corner of the state. He went into deep red and rural areas, saying the way to win was to reach out to the entire state, not just South Florida.\n\nThe day before the election, when Democrats usually make a last pitch in South Florida cities such as Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, Gillum spent his time in small north Florida enclaves.\n\nBesides flipping two Republican U.S. House seats, the other victory for Democrats was a constitutional amendment that will restore the voting rights of most felons who have completed all terms of their sentences. That could potentially add 1.4 million people to the voter rolls.\n\nMinorities and the poor, groups that tend to back Democrats, are disproportionately incarcerated.\n\n\u201cAmendment 4 may change the balance of power,\u201d Poe said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to change some dynamics. That\u2019s just going to change the math. Now the thing is, will those people register and will they vote.\u201d", "The Latest: Prosecutor says 25-year sentence appropriate\n\nFILE - In this June 13, 2018, file photo, Terry Thompson, accused of fatally choking John Hernandez, is shown in court in Houston.

(Sarah Phipps/The Oklahoman via AP)\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) \u2014 A Democratic attorney tapped into a network of enthusiastic women and young people in an increasingly diverse capital city to pull off one of the midterm elections\u2019 biggest upsets, snatching a congressional seat in deep-red Oklahoma that had been in Republican hands for four decades.\n\nTuesday\u2019s victory by Kendra Horn, 42, over retired Army officer and GOP Rep. Steve Russell capped a historic night for female candidates who ran for office, and won, in record numbers across the U.S.\n\nHorn became only the third woman ever elected to Congress from Oklahoma, a state that ranks among the lowest in the nation for women in elective office. But Tuesday saw a dramatic turnaround, especially in Oklahoma City, where women won races up and down the ballot.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve suffered, I think, as a state and as a city from just a vacuum of female viewpoints at the decision-making table, and it changed big time last night,\u201d said Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt, a Republican. \u201cYou\u2019ll have inspiring women wearing judge\u2019s robes, sitting in county commission and city council meetings, serving in our Legislature, and now representing us in Congress, and it all just happened in one fell swoop.\u201d\n\nAs of Wednesday, voters were on track to send at least 100 women to the U.S. House, surpassing the previous record of 84.\n\nHorn, who previously headed two nonprofits that recruit and train female candidates to run for office, focused her messaging on health care and criticized Russell for voting against a requirement that insurance cover people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nRather than talk about President Donald Trump or hot-button issues like abortion or immigration, Horn emphasized her support for public schools, an important issue in Oklahoma following a teacher walkout in the spring, and linked Russell, a former state senator, to the state\u2019s recent budget problems.\n\n\u201cWe focused on talking to people across the 5th District about things that were important to them,\u201d Horn said. \u201cAnd over and over again, we heard their concerns about health care and education, and that\u2019s what we talked to people about.\u201d\n\nHorn said that throughout her campaign, she was approached by enthusiastic women and young people eager to help, a fact that struck her at her watch party Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cI looked around the room and we had this amazing group of young people of different races and ethnic backgrounds. We had women and people who had not previously been engaged, and that\u2019s what is really exciting,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a delegation that looks a little bit more like our overall community now.\u201d\n\nHorn outraised Russell, amassing more than $1 million to his $850,000, according to the latest reports from the Federal Election Commission. Her campaign also got a last-minute boost from a federal super PAC created by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who supports gun control. FEC records show the group spent about $430,000 on ads in support of Horn. Such political action committees can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money as long as expenditures aren\u2019t coordinated with a candidate.\n\nRussell, who was seeking a third term in office, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment Wednesday, but a top campaign adviser said Russell\u2019s refusal to launch advertising critical of Horn may have cost him the race.\n\n\u201cHe did not want to go negative.

John Barrasso defeated Democrat Gary Trauner to win a second full term. Rep. Liz Cheney easily won a second term, beating Democrat Greg Hunter.\n\nWith unemployment low and the oil and gas industries showing renewed life, Democrats had little to run on in Wyoming. What\u2019s more, Trump\u2019s policies of less industry regulation and lower taxes are popular here \u2014 there was essentially no debate whether Trump\u2019s right for the job.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely a fan of the president,\u201d said Jeanne McIlquham, a Republican-leaning voter from Cheyenne who chose Barrasso over Trauner.\n\nStock-market returns under Trump were reason alone to vote a straight Republican ticket, said Cheyenne power plant employee Chet Burton.\n\nWyoming Democrats also suffered by continuing to dwindle in numbers. Heading into the election, they accounted for just 16 percent of registered voters, down from 26 percent a decade ago.\n\nThe Wyoming vote was by no means monolithic. McIlquham voted for Throne.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just kind of tired of what I call the good old boys system,\u201d McIlquham said. \u201cIt just seems like we have the same people running for office, again and again. They move up the ladder but nothing ever changes.\u201d\n\nBut in choosing Gordon over Throne, most voters showed little appetite for change. Out of more than half a dozen potential alternatives between the primary and general elections, they went with the candidate most resembling outgoing Republican Gov. Matt Mead, who is completing his second term and prohibited from seeking a third.\n\nGordon beat five others, including nationally known Republican mega-donor Foster Friess, to win the Republican nomination in August.

Governor-elect Jeanette Nunez, third right, after thanking the crowd Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Orlando, Fla. DeSantis defeated Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum. (Chris Urso/Tampa Bay Times via AP)\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida Democrats tried something new and got the same result, losing the sixth straight governor\u2019s race, possibly losing all three statewide offices on Tuesday\u2019s ballot and winding up with a Senate race that\u2019s too close to call.\n\nIn short, the Democrats\u2019 blue wave hit President Donald Trump\u2019s figurative red wall, and once again Florida maintained its reputation for close elections \u2014 with Republicans having the edge.\n\nRepublican Ron DeSantis defeated Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by less than a percentage point and three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson was hoping a recount would reverse Republican Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s narrow lead.\n\n\u201cIt seems like we\u2019re living up to our history,\u201d said Bob Poe, who was Florida\u2019s Democratic Party chairman during the 2000 presidential recount. \u201cFlorida was just being Florida.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s results could help Trump when he seeks re-election in 2020, with DeSantis and Scott in a better position to use their offices to sway opinions if they maintain support with Florida voters. And while Republicans swept Florida\u2019s statewide races, Democrats again crept closer to winning, and may get a boost going forward from a new constitutional amendment that will restore felons\u2019 voting rights.\n\nBut for now, Republicans maintain their dominance in Florida \u2014 even if by the slimmest of margins.\n\nFor the third straight governor race, a Republican won without winning half the statewide vote. In the Senate race, Scott led Nelson by more than 30,000 votes out of more than 8.1 million cast.\n\nFlorida\u2019s election was largely a referendum on Trump. DeSantis\u2019 primary campaign was based almost entirely on his and Trump\u2019s mutual admiration. And while Democrats despise the president, Republicans love him. He came to Florida twice in the final six days of the election to encourage his base to show up for DeSantis and Scott.\n\nIt may have made the difference, and now DeSantis will be in a position to return the favor. Florida\u2019s 29 electoral college votes will be critical to Trump\u2019s re-election and having a sitting Republican governor will help.\n\nDemocrats did much better in heavily Democratic counties than they did four years ago when Scott beat former Gov. Charlie Crist, said University of North Florida political science professor Matthew Corrigan, who was part of The Associated Press team analyzing returns Tuesday night.\n\nBroward County turnout went from 44 to 57 percent since the last midterm election. Similarly, Miami-Dade County increased turnout from 50 percent to 57 percent.\n\nBut Republicans amped up their turnout even more, Corrigan said. Sumpter County is home to The Villages, an enormous retirement community that overwhelmingly votes Republican. Turnout increased from 67 to 77 percent.\n\n\u201cBasically, the increase in turnout was across the board, but in some of these really Republican counties it was higher,\u201d Corrigan said.\n\nLongtime Tallahassee-based Republican political consultant David Johnson said that while the GOP again dominated at the polls, the state is still purple\n\n\u201cThey turned out vote very, very well. We just turned out a few more,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhen it comes to the midterms, we know who our voters are and we know what we need to do to get them out and we do it. It\u2019s more execution than it is a grand strategy.\u201d\n\nIn the Senate race, Scott did what works for him. He spent more than $60 million of his own money to saturate the state with television and online ads and stuck to a very tight script. While Nelson easily won re-election in 2006 and 2012, he faced nothing like he did with Scott.\n\nScott repeatedly hit the theme that Nelson was a confused, do-nothing senator who has made a career in Washington toeing the party line. He also highlighted Florida\u2019s improved economy under his watch and depicted himself as a strong leader through devastating hurricanes.\n\nFlorida Democrats\u2019 strategy in midterm elections has been to nominate a moderate, white candidate from the central part of the state while targeting their turnout effort to the party\u2019s South Florida stronghold and along the Interstate 4 corridor that runs from Daytona Beach in the east to Tampa Bay in the west.\n\nBut this year, Gillum was the party\u2019s nominee. He was the first African American to be nominated for governor, and he ran as an unabashed liberal. His plan was to excite younger voters, minorities and the wing of the party that calls themselves progressives \u2014 groups that usually turnout in lower numbers in non-presidential election years.\n\nAnd he also refused to focus just on Democratic-rich counties in the southeast corner of the state. He went into deep red and rural areas, saying the way to win was to reach out to the entire state and not just focus on South Florida.\n\nThe day before the election, when Democrats usually make a last pitch in South Florida cities like Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, Gillum spent his time in small north Florida enclaves.\n\nBesides flipping two Republican U.S. House seats, the other victory for Democrats was a constitutional amendment that will restore the voting rights of most felons who have completed all terms of their sentences. That could potentially add 1.4 million people to the voter rolls.\n\nWhile clearly not all felons are Democrats, minorities and the poor, groups that tend to back Democrats, are disproportionately incarcerated.\n\n\u201cAmendment 4 may change the balance of power,\u201d Poe said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to change some dynamics. That\u2019s just going to change the math. Now the thing is, will those people register and will they vote.\u201d", "Voters line up to receive ballots while others fill voting booths inside the northwest Bismarck polling place in Century Baptist Church on Tuesday evening.

But they also cost his party in suburban races that decided the outcome of the House, contributing to the split-decision Trump received from voters.\n\nData gathered by AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 115,000 voters and about 22,000 nonvoters, suggests Trump\u2019s closing arguments about the courts and border security cost his party seats in the House.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why from VoteCast, the survey conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nKAVANAUGH\n\nAhead of Tuesday\u2019s election, both parties claimed the emotionally charged debate over sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh would motivate their supporters to turn out. And it did.\n\nNationally, three-quarters of voters said the tumultuous battle was important to their vote, including 48 percent who said it was very important. Voters who considered it especially important broke for their Democratic House candidate, 56 percent to 43 percent.\n\nBut in key Senate races in the Republican-leaning states where Republicans flipped Democratic seats, those who ranked the debate as very important to their votes leaned toward the GOP. Voters who said the Kavanaugh hearings were very important broke for the Republican 60 percent to 40 percent in North Dakota, 56 percent to 42 percent in Indiana, and 53 percent to 44 percent in Missouri.\n\nKavanaugh faced multiple allegations of sexual misconduct from his youth, which he denied, and was confirmed by a GOP-controlled Congress following widely followed hearings.\n\nThe allegations against Kavanaugh were leveled roughly a year after the start of the #MeToo movement, which has brought national attention to sexual harassment and assault. Overall, 43 percent of voters said they were very concerned about women not being believed when they make allegations of sexual misconduct, and another 35 percent were somewhat concerned.\n\nAbout as many said they were at least somewhat concerned about men not being given the opportunity to defend themselves against allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nWhile voters across most demographic groups considered Kavanaugh important as they cast ballots, there were wide differences in concern over the underlying issue.\n\nMajorities of both men and women said they were at least somewhat concerned about women not being believed when they make allegations of sexual misconduct, but women were more likely than men to say they were very concerned about this, 52 percent to 35 percent.\n\nViews varied widely by gender among Democrats, and just modestly among Republicans: Fully 74 percent of Democratic women said they were very concerned about women not being believed, compared with a smaller majority of Democratic men (56 percent). About a quarter of Republican women, and 2 in 10 Republican men, said they were very concerned about this.\n\nWhile 55 percent of voters in urban areas said they were very concerned about women not being believed when they make allegations of sexual misconduct, 43 percent of suburbanites and 38 percent of voters in small towns and rural places said the same.\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nIn an indication of how the president\u2019s frightful rhetoric over migrant caravans marching toward the U.S.-Mexico border animated Republican base voters, immigration was top-of-mind for about 23 percent of voters, and they broke 78 percent to 20 percent for Republicans. Health care was named the most important issue facing the country by 26 percent of voters, and these voters broke for Democrats by similar margins (74 percent to 23 percent).\n\nVoters overall were divided in their ratings of Trump on his handling of border security: 50 percent said they approve, while the same share disapprove.\n\nTrump fared well on border security among voters in small towns and rural places \u2014 6 in 10 approved, compared with 47 percent of suburban voters, who decided many key House races, and 36 percent of urban voters.\n\nFifty-seven percent of white voters expressed approval of the president on border security. White voters without a college degree were more likely than those with one to say they approved, 64 percent to 49 percent.\n\n___\n\nAP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate conducted in all 50 states by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News.

Native people relied on bison for food, shelter, clothing and tools.\n\nThe U.S. government policy of exterminating the bison helped force Native Americans onto reservations where they were deprived of their traditional food and hunting lifestyle. Wild bison nearly became extinct in the late 19th century.\n\nBut a small population survived in Yellowstone National Park, which was created in 1872 and protected somewhat from poachers by the U.S. Cavalry (Army). In 2018, there are an estimated 4,000 bison roaming Yellowstone Park and more than 20,000 bison in tribally managed herds around the country.\n\nLast week, representatives of several tribes and wildlife conservation organizations gathered in Denver to share their management strategies and discuss the benefits of restoring bison to tribal lands.\n\nGazette Outdoors editor Brett French was at the bison summit to gather perspectives on efforts to restore bison to portions of their historic range. As French told Gazette readers in news reports from Denver, many Native Americans have a strong spiritual connection to bison. Bison provide hope to indigenous people by connecting them with their past and their culture.\n\nRamey Growing Thunder, of Poplar, talked about gathering with many of her Assiniboine and Sioux tribal members to celebrate the buffalo\u2019s return to her reservation in 2000. She described one of the big bulls stepping out of the horse trailer and into a corral, saying it stomped the ground as if to say: \u201cWe\u2019re here now. We\u2019re coming, the buffalo nation.\u201d\n\nThe Fort Peck herd has about 700 bison, including 61 from the Yellowstone Park herd prized for its pure bison genetics.\n\nAn environmental assessment completed earlier this year is supposed to clear the way for transferring additional Yellowstone bison that have already cleared rigorous testing and quarantine to Fort Peck. It\u2019s a slow, complex process involving several federal, state and tribal agencies. Some Montana ranchers adamantly oppose having bison in the state. There is fear of brucellosis, a disease cattle brought to Yellowstone Park more than 100 years ago, that has since been eradicated in cattle, but continues to infect some park bison and elk. Some cattlemen object to sharing the range with bison, and others worry that the wild animals will be destructive.\n\nThe Denver gathering, described by organizers as the first tribal buffalo summit, brought important players together. A second summit would be even more valuable - if cattle ranchers participated.\n\nAfter all, ranchers and tribes are neighbors in Montana and other states in the West. Bison are different in their habits and their impact on the land than cattle. It would be good for cattle ranchers to understand their differences.\n\nMeanwhile, the annual slaughter in Yellowstone continued this past winter with 1,035 animals killed, according to the Interagency Bison Management Plan website. State and tribal hunters took 368 bison. The rest were corralled, loaded into trucks and shipped to slaughter. Additionally, 130 animals were placed in quarantine for potential transfer if they repeatedly test free of exposure to disease -- and government agencies approve a transfer.\n\nHow much better it would be to manage Yellowstone bison with the best science, work with willing Native American groups and disperse the wild bison genes to multiple herds so that the entire future of the species doesn\u2019t depend on Yellowstone. Extensive efforts made over the past three decades have been successful: No cases of bison infecting cattle have been found. The strains of brucellosis that some cattle in the Yellowstone area were exposed to were identified by lab analysis as coming from elk, not bison.\n\nVast herds of bison and the land coexisted for millennia. Surely, there\u2019s room for relatively small herds to be managed in our great, big state without adversely impacting neighbors who raise cattle.\n\nEditorial: https://bit.ly/2DbWTR1\n\n___\n\nBozeman Daily Chronicle, Nov. 2, on the responsibility to keep recycling viable:\n\nMore and more Montanans are turning to recycling as a means of disposing of their solid waste. And that\u2019s a good thing. Or at least it should be. As indicated in an Oct. 21 Chronicle report, abuse of the recycling system \u2014 dropping off waste that can\u2019t be recycled \u2014 is threatening the viability of recycling businesses and programs.\n\nMost people mean well. They think if they put just about anything in a recycling bin, someone will find a way to reuse it. But we all need to realize that \u2014 at best \u2014 recycling programs operate on the fringes of viability. Many don\u2019t pay for themselves and require some government subsidy to continue operations. If they dip too far into the red, recycling businesses will shut down and government run programs will curtail the materials they are willing to accept.\n\nIt\u2019s up to us to keep these programs \u2014 both private-sector and government-operated \u2014 up and running. We have to learn the rules and follow them closely. China has been taking much of the recycled material from the U.S., but recyclers report that because recyclables are contaminated with too much unacceptable material, China has set standards that are virtually impossible to meet, forcing them to turn to North American processors that are more expensive, further threatening the viability of recycling programs.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to be a good recycling consumer. Perhaps the most familiar recycling program to Gallatin County residents are the big yellow bins around town and around the county that are managed by the Gallatin Solid Waste Management District. The bins have easy to understand posters on them delineating what can be recycled and what cannot. More detailed parameters for recyclable materials can be found on the district\u2019s website at https://gallatinsolidwaste.org/recycling/.\n\nAnd all of us can practice common sense treatment of recyclables, like making sure everything is clean, free of foodstuffs and crushed into its most compact form.\n\nWith landfill space running out in many urban areas, solid waste disposal will be one of the biggest environmental concerns of the 21st century. Recycling is an important part of addressing the issue. But it can only be effective if we, the consumers, do it right.\n\nEditorial: https://bit.ly/2yYehp7", "MUNCIE, Ind.
