["FAIRBANKS, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Construction at military facilities in interior Alaska is attracting strong interest from contractors.\n\nThe Procurement Technical Assistance Program in Fairbanks announced a presentation, scheduled for Wednesday, on how to do business with the military, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported .\n\nOrganizers expected about 30 people to sign up, said contract specialist Pierre Thompson. Instead, they quickly filled reservations last week for the planned venue with responses from 135 people.\n\n\u201cThis blew up in my face,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI put it out on Monday, and it was pretty much filled on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nLikewise, by the weekend, there were only a few seats in Anchorage for a live-stream version of the presentation at the office of Associated General Contractors of Alaska.\n\nThe meeting will feature Army and Air force military contractor officials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all-encompassing, so if you are an electrician, or if you cater, or if you do anything that would be involved with doing a lot of construction, then these contracts will be something that you will be interested in,\u201d said Jacqueline Summers, a program specialist in Anchorage for the Procurement Technical Assistant Program.\n\nThe meeting is planned as the Defense Department continues $500 million in construction projects at Eielson Air Force Base south of Fairbanks in preparation for the arrival of F-35 fighter jets in 2020.\n\nFort Wainwright in Fairbanks has an upcoming environmental remediation project. Fort Greely at Delta Junction is installing additional missile defense interceptors, and Clear Air Force Station is installing a new long-range radar system.\n\nThe meeting will include staff from the 354th Contracting Squadron at Eielson and the 715th Contracting Team at Fort Wainwright.\n\n\u201cUsually those contracting officers are really hard to get a face-to-face meeting with, so the fact that they\u2019re coming out and actively recruiting is kind of a sign that there\u2019s a lot going on,\u201d Summers said.\n\nStaff from the U.S. Small Business Administration and the Associated General Contractors of America will also be at the meeting.\n\nThe program hopes to hold additional meetings about military contacting next spring, Thompson said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Fairbanks (Alaska) Daily News-Miner, http://www.newsminer.com", "", "", "1 of 3 Oakland Raiders head coach Jon Gruden gestures during the second half of an NFL football game between the Raiders and the Los Angeles Chargers in Oakland, Calif., Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018. (AP Photo/John Hefti)\n\nALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Oakland coach Jon Gruden said he should take the blame for Derek Carr\u2019s bewildering fourth-down throwaway that ended any slim chance of a Raiders comeback.\n\nCarr\u2019s decision to throw the ball at the feet of running back Jalen Richard when no one was open on a fourth-and-5 play in the fourth quarter of a 20-6 loss Sunday to the Los Angeles Chargers summed up Oakland\u2019s fifth straight loss.\n\nCarr rolled right on the play looking for Richard in the flat. But with Melvin Ingram chasing him, Carr just threw the ball away rather than give any of his receivers even a chance at making a play.\n\n\u201cIt was a terrible call by me,\u201d Gruden said Monday. \u201cIt was a design for Jalen Richard against man-to-man coverage. There wasn\u2019t a lot (Carr) could have done. He could have been Fran Tarkenton and done a 360 and reversed the field a few times. There wasn\u2019t much there. You got to credit the play caller with that outcome.\u201d\n\nThe Raiders (1-8) were probably hurt more by another fourth-down call on the opening drive. Gruden decided to go for it from the 1 and used a play other teams had success running on the Chargers in the past.\n\nReceiver Dwayne Harris came across the formation to take a shovel pass from Carr, but was unable to get to the edge because of missed blocking assignments. Harris was stopped for no gain and the Raiders didn\u2019t get into the end zone.\n\n\u201cOnce again, it was not a very good play call because it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cA lot of people are running that play, as you know, in the tight red zone for obvious reasons. My first time using it wasn\u2019t a great experience.\u201d\n\nVery little has been great for the Raiders this season as they are off to the third-worst start in franchise history, trailing only the 0-10 mark in Carr\u2019s rookie season of 2014 and an 0-13 mark in 1962 \u2014 one year before Al Davis joined the franchise as coach and then owner.\n\nThe stretch the Raiders are currently on is as bad as any they\u2019ve had in 59 seasons as a professional team. They have lost five straight by at least 14 points for the first time ever and are one 14-point loss shy of tying the single-season record for the most by any team since the merger.\n\nOakland has been outscored 75-9 in the past nine quarters and was held without a TD in consecutive games for the first time since 2012.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s dark right now,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough. It\u2019s tough on our fans. I thank our fans for showing up and being with us. We\u2019re going to bring this thing back. I\u2019ve been a part of it before and we\u2019ve got some great people to build around. We\u2019ve got some resources to keep building. I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d\n\nThe Raiders will go ahead with some key injuries at receiver with Martavis Bryant out with an injured PCL in his knee. Jordy Nelson also hurt his knee and his status for this week remains unknown. Oakland already traded away No. 1 receiver Amari Cooper, leaving Brandon LaFell and Seth Roberts as the team\u2019s top two options.\n\nThose injuries could lead to an opportunity for rookie Marcell Ateman, who was promoted from the practice squad last month but hasn\u2019t had a chance to play yet. Gruden also said he might bring in some receivers this week to try out.\n\nThe Raiders won\u2019t be getting a boost from defensive tackle Eddie Vanderdoes, who was placed on season-ending injured reserve Monday when he was unable to come back from knee surgery. Vanderdoes tore his ACL in the final game of the 2017 season and began this year on the physically unable to perform list after a setback in training camp.\n\nHe spent the past three weeks practicing but the team determined it was best to let him rest up for next year.\n\n\u201cWe expected him to be ready in camp,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI think right now it\u2019s not 100 percent. He hadn\u2019t had enough padded practices and been in the trenches enough to activate him, perhaps reinjuring that. I think it\u2019s the wise thing to do. We will try to move forward without him and get him healthy for next year.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Japanese two-way star Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Angels wins AL Rookie of the Year award\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Japanese two-way star Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Angels wins AL Rookie of the Year award.", "LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Sentencing has been postponed to next year for a former Las Vegas Strip illusion show headliner who lost a bid to withdraw his guilty plea in a federal child pornography case.\n\nRecords show that Jan Rouven Fuechtener (YAHN\u2019 ROO\u2019-vehn FOOSH\u2019-ten-er) obtained a new lawyer Nov. 1 and his sentencing was reset for Feb. 21 on felony possession, receipt and distribution of child pornography charges.\n\nHis new attorney, Russell Marsh, was unavailable Monday, the Veterans Day holiday, to immediately comment.\n\nThe 40-year-old Fuechtener is expected to face at least 24 years in prison.\n\nHe\u2019s a German citizen who performed as illusionist Jan Rouven at the Tropicana hotel-casino.\n\nHis plea in November 2016 stopped his trial during FBI testimony about images found in password-protected files on computers at Fuechtener\u2019s home.", "Ronald Acuna Jr. of Atlanta Braves wins NL Rookie of the Year award\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Ronald Acuna Jr. of Atlanta Braves wins NL Rookie of the Year award.", "FILE - At left, in an Oct. 7, 2018, file photo, Minnesota Vikings' Latavius Murray runs against the Philadelphia Eagles during an NFL football game, in Philadelphia.

(AP Photo/File)\n\nEAGAN, Minn. (AP) \u2014 Dalvin Cook\u2019s rush through the left side of the line for 70 yards last week was the longest gain of his professional career, an early game boost for the Minnesota Vikings in an important victory over Detroit before their bye.\n\nThat was the type of big running play that has been missing in most of Minnesota\u2019s games this year, a 22.05 mph burst that was clocked by the NFL\u2019s Next Gen Stats as the fastest in the league in 2018.\n\nThat also demonstrated what the Vikings will need more of down the stretch with a daunting schedule ahead.\n\nCook\u2019s return from a hamstring injury that kept him out of five games was one of the most important developments of the season.\n\n\u201cWhen you go to the zoo and you want to see a white tiger and they say, \u2019He\u2019s not coming out today, you\u2019re disappointed and you\u2019re like, \u2019That\u2019s why I bought the ticket, to see the white tiger,\u201d quarterback Kirk Cousins said after the Vikings beat the Lions 24-9 on Nov. 4. \u201cThat\u2019s Dalvin. When you get him, he\u2019s special.\u201d\n\nThough Latavius Murray has 439 total yards and five touchdowns over the past five games, Cook\u2019s return will be vital toward continuing the revival of a running game that ranks 28th in the league with an average of 91.7 yards per game.\n\nThe Vikings (5-3-1) play at NFC North-leading Chicago (6-3) on Sunday night in a game for control of the division. That\u2019s one of three games over the next four for the Vikings that will be on the road and outdoors in northern cities.\n\n\u201cI do think with some of these games as it starts to get colder, it is going to be more of a factor,\u201d coach Mike Zimmer said. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting better at a lot of the areas in the running game. We have to continue searching for more ways to pound the ball.\u201d\n\nWhen Cook was healthy in the season opener against San Francisco, the Vikings had 116 rushing yards. They then went four straight games with fewer than 20 rushing attempts and 77 rushing yards or fewer, until Murray produced a 155-yard performance on 24 carries in a victory over Arizona on Oct. 14 .\n\nCook and Murray combined for 120 rushing yards against the Lions. The Vikings have averaged 124 rushing yards over the past four games, up from 65.8 yards per game on the ground over the first five weeks.\n\n\u201cHe has got a chance to hit home runs,\u201d Zimmer said of Cook. \u201cI think it was really good for him to get out there and get some game time action. When you haven\u2019t played in six weeks and you haven\u2019t practiced all that much, I think he will continue to get better.\u201d\n\nThe Vikings also claimed running back Ameer Abdullah last week after he was waived by the Lions. Abdullah, a second-round draft pick in 2015, only appeared in three games this year and carried the ball once. He averaged 3.8 yards per attempt in three seasons as the primary ball carrier, when he wasn\u2019t injured, before being replaced by rookie Kerryon Johnson this season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m entering a backfield with a lot of talent, Dalvin, we have Latavius and all the guys who\u2019ve been here,\u201d Abdullah said after practice on Monday. \u201cJust coming in today and seeing these guys welcome me the way they have has been amazing for me. It does a lot for my confidence. It does a lot for my focus.\u201d\n\nAbdullah will also be an option as a kickoff returner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to work,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything the Vikings ask me to do, I\u2019m willing to do just because I\u2019m so appreciative of the opportunity.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "THOUSAND OAKS, Calif.

His ejection was automatic because it was his second unsportsmanlike penalty \u2014 each player on both teams had been assessed one following the earlier melee.\n\n\u201cCharlie is a competitor and he is trying to get a first down and he has to watch the rest of the game from the locker room.

This is what we\u2019re capable of.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys (4-5) were in a desperate spot visiting the defending champion Eagles because of an up-and-down season notable for its struggles on offense.

At the time, it sort of symbolized the season for an inconsistent offense.\n\nStill, Elliott had 151 yards rushing and a touchdown, with another 36 yards receiving and a score. Prescott\u2019s line looked similar to 2016 as well: 270 yards passing, no turnovers and a 100-plus rating.\n\nThe 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year led two 75-yard drives to touchdowns in the fourth quarter, both of them answers to tying TDs from the Eagles. Elliott finished off each of them after big plays to several receivers along the way.\n\n\u201cIt just showed the attitude of this team going into this game,\u201d said Elliott, who surged two spots to second in the NFL in rushing behind MVP contender Todd Gurley of the Rams. \u201cWe knew we had to win. I\u2019m proud of these guys.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys ran off 11 straight wins when Prescott and Elliott were rookies on the way to an NFC-best 13 wins.

But Rosen\u2019s screen pass, intended for Johnson, was intercepted by Justin Houston at the Cardinals 35. That led to a Kansas City touchdown. After that, Rosen was battered behind some shaky pass protection as Arizona was forced to mainly abandon the run.\n\nOn defense, poor play in the Arizona secondary led to a quick Kansas City touchdown on the game\u2019s first possession. But the Cardinals were tough after that, sacking Mahomes five times \u2014 two by Chandler Jones. Mahomes had never been sacked more than twice in a game before Sunday.\n\n\u201cI thought the D-line did a tremendous job of staying in their rush lanes,\u201d Wilks said. \u201cCoverage-wise, I thought those guys at times when we were able to get to him, he was holding the ball.

What is known is that it started Thursday near Cowley\u2019s property in the tiny town of Pulga, incinerated the neighboring town of Paradise and killed at least 42 people.\n\nOn Monday, fire investigators declared the area surrounding power lines on Cowley\u2019s property, in an oak-filled canyon, a crime scene. Security guards would not let PG&E inspectors pass.\n\nCowley said she was on vacation last Wednesday when she got a surprise email from PG&E. Details of that exchange, described to The Associated Press, combined with the utility\u2019s track record in California wildfire history has again brought the company under scrutiny.\n\nThe email said that crews needed to come to her property to work on the high-power lines, Cowley said.

They visited her property but she said she wasn\u2019t there Wednesday and was not aware of their findings.\n\nCowley was back at the property Monday and expressed gratitude at finding most of the 65 structures on it still standing, just a few hundred feet from the crime scene where investigators worked to determine what had happened to spark the massive fire.\n\nThe former landscaper bought Pulga, an abandoned and decrepit historic gold prospecting town, in 2015 and embarked on a project that transformed it into a picturesque private destination. She cleared overgrown brush, patched up buildings and added new ones. With Bay Area artists and architects, she recreated a town, complete with a stage and school house. And then, a year ago, she opened for business, renting out Pulga for corporate retreats.\n\nAs she reached the site of her own home, she raised her hand to her cheek.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone,\u201d she said. \u2019That\u2019s where all my stuff was, but it\u2019s not there anymore.\u201d\n\nShe paused and picked up a mug that somehow had survived the inferno. \u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d Cowley told herself quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nPG&E declined to discuss the email it sent Cowley with AP, saying it has provided an \u201cinitial electric incident report\u201d with state regulators and will fully cooperate with any investigations.\n\nPublicly, PG&E has said it experienced a problem on an electrical transmission line near the site of the massive fire, minutes before the blaze broke out.\n\nIn its Friday filing to the state Public Utilities Commission, it said it had detected an outage on an electrical transmission line near the site of the blaze. It said a subsequent aerial inspection detected damage to a transmission tower on the line.\n\nThe area where CalFire says the blaze started, and where PG&E says sparks were detected on Cowley\u2019s property is roughly the same, according to an AP reporter at the site.\n\nThe utility, which has been criticized and sued in a number of other large and deadly fires across California, had announced before the blaze started that it might shut down power in nine counties, including Butte County where Pulga and Paradise are, because of extreme fire danger. But it never did.\n\nLater Thursday, PG&E said it had decided against a power cut because weather conditions did not warrant one.\n\nState Sen. Jerry Hill, a Redwood City Democrat and longtime critic of the utility, called the report of troubles on PG&E\u2019s lines in the area extremely worrisome.\n\n\u201cIf PG&E is found responsible for burning down the state again, at some point we have to say enough is enough and we have to ask should this company be allowed to do business in California?\u201d Hill said. \u201cThese fires take a spark, and at least in the last few years fires have been caused by negligent behavior by PG&E. We need to see how we can hold them responsible, or look at alternative way of doing business.\u201d\n\nCalifornia utility regulators are working with CalFire staff on their own, separate investigation into whether PG&E complied with state rules and regulations in areas that were torched in the fire.\n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission will be evaluating PG&E\u2019s maintenance of their facilities, vegetation management and emergency preparedness and response, said commission spokeswoman Terrie Prosper.\n\nThis is not the first time PG&E\u2019s management practices have come under question in the drought-stricken state.\n\nIn 2014, regulators ordered the state\u2019s investor-owned utilities to set priorities for inspecting and removing dead and sick trees near their power lines, warning that \u201cclimate change has facilitated and exacerbated numerous wildfires\u201d that have damaged and threatened their facilities.\n\nBut after a wildfire killed two people, destroyed 475 homes and scorched 70,000 acres in the Sierra Nevada foothills the following year, homeowners and their attorneys questioned whether PG&E had done enough to clear dry trees flanking its power lines. In 2016, Cal Fire ultimately found PG&E was responsible for that fire, after tree maintenance by PG&E and its contractors led to a tree falling on a power line.\n\nInvestigators have determined that PG&E equipment started several of the 2017 wildfires in Northern California wine country that killed 44 people. The company says it expects to pay more than $2.5 billion.\n\n___\n\nBurke reported from San Francisco.

(AP Photo/Michael Woods)\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 Although LSU cannot win the Southeastern Conference championship, victories in its next two games will result in a regular season that exceeded expectations by a wide margin.\n\nThe 10th-ranked Tigers need to beat Rice this Saturday and Texas A&M in College Station the following week for their first 10-win regular season since 2012. That probably also would put LSU in a New Year\u2019s Six Bowl.\n\nSo while coach Ed Orgeron hoped the Tigers could contend for a championship, he doesn\u2019t want to downplay the improvement he\u2019s seen in the program, which was ranked 25th in the preseason poll and climbed as high as fourth before sliding back on the heels of a loss to No. 1 Alabama.\n\n\u201cThis team wanted to win a national championship,\u201d Orgeron said. \u201cBut, we never set that as a goal for this team. This is LSU. I know the expectations. We are getting the most out of this football team. We still have two tough games to go. Going to a New Year\u2019s Day bowl would be a good step.\u201d\n\nThe Tigers did enough to defeat Arkansas 24-17 last Saturday. LSU squandered much of a 21-point advantage in the fourth quarter before running out the clock to preserve its eighth victory of the year.\n\n\u201cWe have to finish the game,\u201d Orgeron said. \u201cI was disappointed that we did not finish the game strong.\u201d\n\nFor the first time since the Ole Miss game in late September, quarterback Joe Burrow threw a touchdown pass \u2014 a 40-yarder to Justin Jefferson. However, for the fifth consecutive game, Burrow failed to throw for more than 200 yards.\n\nMoreover, the Tigers have had just one back rush for more than 100 yards in that five-game span. Clyde Edwards-Helaire ran for 145 yards in LSU\u2019s 36-16 victory against Georgia.\n\n\u201cWe have lost our identity on offense,\u201d Oregeron said. \u201cWe have been trying some new things. Maybe we have put too much in. We may need to simplify.\u201d\n\nOrgeron said he told offensive coordinator Steve Ensminger, \u201cLet\u2019s look at what we did vs. Georgia. Are we covering up for some of our weaknesses? Is it that we can\u2019t have enough receivers out in routes because of (pass) protection?\u201d\n\nThis season was expected to be a rebuilding year, largely because LSU\u2019s offense entered the season with only three returning starters: tight end Foster Moreau, left tackle Saahdiq Charles and left guard Garrett Brumfield. LSU lost a fourth returning starter when right guard Ed Ingram was suspended indefinitely before the start of practice.\n\nCharles and Brumfield have missed a combined eight games. Those two players have been together on the starting offensive line just four times.\n\n\u201cThe offensive line has played good, but we have not been consistent,\u201d starting center Lloyd Cushenberry said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little mixture of everything. Sometimes things happen in football. Coming into the season, people thought we were going get demolished in every game. We have done well.\n\n\u201cGetting to a New Year\u2019s Six bowl game would be huge for this team,\u201d Cushenberry added. \u201cPeople outside the team didn\u2019t think we were going to be good this year. They thought we would win just six games. We have a chance to prove ourselves right and that they were wrong.\u201d\n\nLSU is a 40-plus point favorite over a one-win Rice team. The Tigers will have a greater challenge when they close the regular season at Texas A&M.\n\n\u201cOur target this week is Rice and nothing else,\u201d Orgeron said. \u201cOur focus is to be 9-2 at the end of the week. Getting to a New Year\u2019s bowl is really important for the players. We have talked about finishing strong. We have to play well this week and play well next week.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "LAS CRUCES, N.M.

After all, this is the same bunch that began 9-1 for one of the best starts in franchise history.\n\nMalone\u2019s missive to his team: Rediscover that resolve.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early in the season to have their heads down and have it be gloom and doom,\u201d said Malone, whose team hosts James Harden, Chris Paul and the Houston Rockets on Tuesday night. \u201cWe\u2019re young. Some of these guys are in moments they haven\u2019t been in before. That\u2019s my job, to teach and keep this team moving along in the right direction.\u201d\n\nGiven their recent history, there\u2019s a sense of early season urgency. That\u2019s understandable since the Nuggets missed the playoffs by a game in each of the last two years. They don\u2019t want piled-up losses in November to come back and haunt them in April.\n\nEspecially since everything was going so smoothly out of the gate. But the Nuggets (9-4) have followed a two-point loss in Memphis with two straight defeats at home \u2014112-110 to Brooklyn on Friday and 121-114 to Milwaukee on Sunday, where 7-footer Brook Lopez hit eight 3-pointers.\n\n\u201cThe first thing is to acknowledge it for what it is \u2014 a couple really close losses,\u201d said Nuggets center Mason Plumlee, whose team had only one skid that reached as high as three games a season ago. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t call it a tailspin. We have another opportunity (against Houston) to get back on track.\u201d\n\nThis is a Nuggets team that a week ago was being billed as one of the surprises in the West. They knocked off Boston in a game where Jamal Murray erupted for 48 points. Murray took some heat, though, for shooting at the buzzer in his bid to reach 50.\n\nIn the three losses since the Celtics contest, he\u2019s scored a combined 45 points.\n\nIt\u2019s also been an up-and-down stretch for standout center Nikola Jokic, who\u2019s gone from taking one jumper against Memphis \u2014 a long 3-pointer at the end \u2014 to bouncing back with 37 points against Brooklyn to scoring 20 against Milwaukee. He also had a late turnover against the Bucks \u2014 one of three Nuggets miscues over the final 3:04 with the team leading by a basket.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not like a big disconnect,\u201d Plumlee said. \u201cWe have to execute better on both ends in late-game situations. It\u2019s unexpected because we executed so well early and often in that winning streak. We did last year, too. It will be better.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the Nuggets spent the early portion of practice reviewing game film. Like always, Malone showed footage and asked for volunteers to give their input. And like always, one of the hands that shot up belonged to injured point guard Isaiah Thomas.\n\nHis words carry a lot of weight even if he can\u2019t take the floor as he recovers from hip surgery.\n\n\u201cThe guys understand his body of work, the player he has been, and the player he will be again,\u201d Malone said. \u201cHis leadership, his voice, his encouraging guys, his getting on guys, I think it\u2019s invaluable.\u201d\n\nJust Thomas\u2019 way of being a leader. There remains no timetable for his return.\n\n\u201cYou need a guy like that in the locker room,\u201d guard Monte Morris said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s good, he\u2019ll tell you. When it\u2019s bad, he just tells us. We definitely appreciate him.\u201d\n\nOne early surprise has been the play of the bench, with Morris, Trey Lyles, Plumlee and Malik Beasley giving the Nuggets a lift. Case in point: Morris had a career-high 10 assists against the Bucks.\n\n\u201cOur fun is creating turnovers and getting out into the transition, giving the fans at Pepsi Center what they came to see \u2014 fast basketball,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIf we can defend like we\u2019ve been doing and get out in transition, it will be fun. We\u2019ve been having fun all year.\u201d\n\nThis losing stretch, Plumlee reasoned, is just a tiny hiccup.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re a good enough team where that shouldn\u2019t be the case,\u201d Plumlee said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be sharper.

(AP Photo/Frank Victores)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 The dynamic Saints running back duo of Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara agree that the word \u201csavage\u201d best describes New Orleans\u2019 offense.\n\nCertainly, the Saints are scoring so often, and in so many ways, it\u2019s enough to bruise defenders\u2019 egos.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we don\u2019t have to play them,\u201d Saints linebacker Alex Anzalone said Monday, a day after New Orleans broke the 50-point mark in a victory over Cincinnati.\n\nEven by the lofty standards offensive-minded coach Sean Payton and record-setting quarterback Drew Brees have set since joining forces in 2006, New Orleans is putting points on the board with exceptional proficiency.\n\nThe Saints have never averaged better than 34.2 points per game for an entire season. That mark was set by New Orleans\u2019 2011 squad that featured Brees and four skill players that each gained more than 950 yards from scrimmage: tight end Jimmy Graham, receiver Marques Colston, and running backs Darren Sproles and Pierre Thomas.\n\nThe 2018 Saints, who host defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia on Sunday, currently lead the NFL with an average 36.7 points through nine games. Maintaining that pace for the rest of the regular season would put them third all-time in scoring behind the 2013 Denver Broncos (37.9 points per game) and the 2007 New England Patriots (36.8). And the way the Saints are playing, their current scoring average could very well increase before the season is out. They\u2019ve scored at least 40 points in five of nine games so far.\n\nThey\u2019ve also added yet another potential receiving target, signing veteran Brandon Marshall on Monday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got good length and size. He\u2019s another big target,\u201d Payton said of the 34-year-old Marshall, who became a free agent when he was released by Seattle on Oct. 30. \u201cI thought size was important but (also) experience and someone that we felt had strong hands.\u201d\n\nEleven different Saints have gotten in the end zone this season, including Brees, who dove over the pile at the line of scrimmage for his third rushing TD this season during Sunday\u2019s 51-14 triumph at Cincinnati. The 39-year-old QB also is having one of his most efficient seasons, completing 77.3 percent of his passes for 21 TDs and only one interception.\n\nBrees\u2019 completion rate arguably has been aided by his decision to often throw shorter passes, particularly to Kamara, who has 55 receptions for 473 yards and three TDs. But Brees asserts that Saints\u2019 offensive production has stemmed in no small part from their ability to methodically sustain drives with high-percentage plays.\n\n\u201cIt pays dividends as the game goes on,\u201d Brees said. \u201cYou wear a defense down. ... We say, \u2019Don\u2019t get bored with the (short) completions, the four-yard runs. They result in big plays if we keep it up.\u201d\n\nA case in point is Brees\u2019 72-yard game-breaking touchdown pass to receiver Michael Thomas in the final minutes of a Week 9 victory over the Los Angeles Rams, whose defenders crashed down to swarm Kamara on the play.\n\nDuring the Payton-Brees era, the Saints have more often than not been a pass-heavy team. But not this season. New Orleans ranks eighth in yards rushing and seventh in yards passing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to have balance,\u201d Payton said. \u201cOur offensive line has played well. We\u2019ve been consistent rushing the football. I feel like Drew\u2019s playing at high level. ... Having that ability to rush or pass is something that can help.\u201d\n\nAnd while Brees is in the twilight of his career, New Orleans is enjoying major production from two of its younger skill players.\n\nThe 23-year-old Kamara has 1,109 yards and 14 TDs from scrimmage on mix of runs and receptions. Thomas, 25, has caught 78 passes for 950 yards and seven TDs.\n\nSaints right tackle Ryan Ramczyk is in only his second NFL season, but said even he can see the Saints\u2019 offense is \u201cdefinitely special.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cohesiveness up front really helps us out. And then guys like Mark and Alvin and Drew, Michael \u2014 all those guys around us \u2014 are special athletes,\u201d Ramzcyk said. \u201cWhen we come together, we can make a lot of great things happen.\u201d\n\nAnd that takes a lot of pressure off the Saints\u2019 defense, which yielded 48 points in a season-opening loss, but since has been good enough to help New Orleans win eight straight. Next up are the Philadelphia Eagles (4-5).\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to be super heroes,\u201d Anzalone said. \u201cThings aren\u2019t going to always go our way, but we just have to give our offense a chance, and we\u2019ve been able to do that these past eight games.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "", "Rep.-elect Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., listens during a news conference with members of the Progressive Caucus in Washington, Monday, Nov. 12, 2018.

But a week after the voting, Democrats are riding higher than they thought on election night.\n\nAs vote counting presses on in several states, the Democrats have steadily chalked up victories across the country, firming up their grip on the U.S. House of Representatives and statehouses. The slow roll of wins has given the party plenty to celebrate.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was quick to claim victory for his party on election night. But the Democrats, who hit political rock bottom just two years ago, have now picked up at least 32 seats in the House \u2014 and lead in four more \u2014 in addition to flipping seven governorships and eight state legislative chambers.\n\nThey are on track to lose two seats in the Senate in a year both parties predicted more. On Monday night, Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema won Arizona\u2019s Senate race, beating Republican Rep. Martha McSally to take the seat held by retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake.\n\nThe overall results in the first nationwide election of the Trump presidency represent the Democratic Party\u2019s best midterm performance since Watergate.\n\n\u201cOver the last week we\u2019ve moved from relief at winning the House to rejoicing at a genuine wave of diverse, progressive and inspiring Democrats winning office,\u201d said Ben Wikler, Washington director of the liberal group MoveOn.\n\nA U.S. house district that includes Charleston, South Carolina has elected a Democrat for the first time in 40 years. Attorney and ocean engineer Joe Cunningham flipped the seat from GOP control in Tuesday's elections. (Nov. 8)\n\nThe blue shift alters the trajectory of Trump\u2019s next two years in the White House, breaking up the Republican monopoly in Washington. It also gives Democrats stronger footing in key states ahead of the next presidential race and in the redrawing of congressional districts \u2014 a complicated process that has been dominated by the GOP, which has drawn favorable boundaries for their candidates.\n\nTrump and his allies discounted the Democratic victories on Monday, pointing to GOP successes in Republican-leaning states.\n\n\u201cThanks to the grassroots support for @realDonaldTrump and our party\u2019s ground game, we were able to #DefyHistory and make gains in the Senate!\u201d Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted, citing Senate wins in Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota and Tennessee, among others.\n\nIndeed, just once in the past three decades had a sitting president added Senate seats in his first midterm election. But lost in McDaniel\u2019s assessment was the difficult 2018 Senate landscape for Democrats, who were defending 10 seats in states Trump carried just two years ago.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said in an interview: \u201cI believe in facts. And the fact of the matter is, the Democratic Party had a historic night at the ballot box \u2014 and we are not resting,\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cOur goal was to compete everywhere, to expand and reshape the electorate everywhere \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats found success by attracting support from women, minorities and college-educated voters. Overall, 50 percent of white college-educated voters and 56 percent of women backed Democrats nationwide, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate.\n\nDemocrats featured historic diversity on the ballot.\n\nTheir winning class includes Massachusetts\u2019 first African-American female member of Congress, Ayanna Presley, and Michigan\u2019s Rashida Talib and Minnesota\u2019s Ilhan Omar, the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, along with Kansas\u2019 Sharice Davids, the first lesbian Native American.\n\nThey also won by running candidates with military backgrounds who openly embraced gun ownership, such as Pennsylvania Rep. Conor Lamb and Maine\u2019s Jared Golden, who is poised to win his contest because of the state\u2019s ranked-choice voting system.\n\nThe Democrats needed to gain 23 seats to seize the House majority. Once all the votes are counted, which could take weeks in some cases as absentees and provisional ballots are tallied, they could win close to 40.\n\nDemocrats have not lost a single House incumbent so far. Yet they defeated Republican targets such as Reps. Mike Coffman of Colorado, Barbara Comstock of Virginia, Carlos Curbelo of Florida and Dana Rohrabacher of California.\n\nThey could win as many as 19 House races in districts carried by Trump two years ago, according to House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm.\n\nTen House races remained too close for the AP to call as of Monday evening.\n\nFar more of the Senate landscape was decided early, although contests in Florida and Mississippi remain outstanding.\n\nWhile there were notable statehouse Democratic losses in Iowa and Ohio, the party flipped governorships in seven states: Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Kansas, New Mexico and Maine.\n\nRepublicans now control 25 governorships nationwide compared to 23 for Democrats. High-profile contests in Florida and Georgia remain outstanding, though Republicans hold narrow leads in both states.\n\nOvershadowed perhaps by the higher-profile statewide elections, Democratic gains in state legislatures could prove deeply consequential.\n\nOverall, they flipped state legislative chambers in eight states this midterm season, including Washington state\u2019s Senate in 2017. The others include the state Senates in Maine, Colorado, New York, New Hampshire and Connecticut in addition to the state Houses of Representatives in New Hampshire and Minnesota.\n\nWith hundreds of races still too close to call, Democrats have won at least 370 new state legislative seats nationwide, according to the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, although the new seats were offset by Republican wins in some cases. The pickups include surprises in West Virginia, where Democrats knocked off the GOP majority leader-designate in the House and the majority leader in the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe have elected a new generation of inspiring leaders and we know that a new era of democratic dominance is on the horizon,\u201d said the committee\u2019s executive director Jessica Post.\n\nStill, Republicans will control the majority of state legislative chambers, governorships, the U.S. Senate and the White House.

(AP Photo/Dave Thompson)\n\nMANCHESTER, England (AP) \u2014 Previously concluded Financial Fair Play cases could be reopened, UEFA warned on Monday as evidence grows of Manchester City\u2019s attempts to disguise its source of income and spending.\n\nThe UEFA statement on the prospect of the financial compliance system being \u201cabused\u201d by teams comes after internal correspondence exposing City\u2019s alleged deception was published by European media outlets.\n\nThe reigning English Premier League champion and current leader has not provided a defense or disputed the authenticity of the information from leaked emails which reveal elaborate attempts over several years to try to avoid breaching the rules designed to curb overspending on player costs.\n\nCity, which has been owned by Abu Dhabi\u2019s Sheikh Mansour for a decade, has already been punished for violating FFP after reaching a settlement agreement with UEFA in 2014 that saw it fined rather than banned from the Champions League.\n\nHaving spent more than a week declining to comment on the information in the \u201cFootball Leaks\u201d documents, UEFA has issued a response to questions about City that raises the prospect of new sanctions.\n\n\u201cShould new information suggest that previously concluded cases have been abused, those cases may be capable of being re-opened as determined on a case by case basis,\u201d UEFA said. \u201cThis approach is applied universally to all clubs that apply for a UEFA license and participate in European club competitions.\u201d\n\nThe agreement with UEFA eventually saw City forfeit only 20 million euros ($23 million) in Champions League prize money. UEFA has not said how aware it was in 2014 of City\u2019s plans to hide spending of more recent schemes, which have been reported in a five-part series by German magazine Der Spiegel.\n\n\u201cFFP is a framework which clubs that wish to play in UEFA competitions agree to abide by,\u201d the organizer of the Champions League and Europa League said in a statement. \u201cIt relies on the cooperation of clubs to declare a complete and genuine financial position. While UEFA can test the information it receives, it relies on that information being fair and accurate reflections of a club\u2019s finances.\u201d\n\nThe title sponsor of City\u2019s stadium, training campus, and jersey backer is Etihad Airways, the state-owned airline from Abu Dhabi. Sheikh Mansour is a member of Abu Dhabi\u2019s royal family and deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe leaks emails claimed to show in 2015 how the Etihad deal generated 67.5 million pounds annually for City. But City\u2019s holding company \u2014 state-backed Abu Dhabi United Group \u2014 channeled 59.9 million pounds back to Etihad, according to Jorge Chumillas, the club chief financial officer in an internal email.\n\nThe evidence could be significant for UEFA which checks clubs\u2019 finances annually to ensure they are meeting break-even requirements on a rolling three-year basis.\n\n\u201cThis includes a thorough assessment of clubs\u2019 financial positions on the basis of both the information disclosed by the clubs (based on their independently audited financial statements) as well as a number of compliance checks and analysis undertaken by UEFA (including independent external audits),\u201d UEFA said. \u201cIf new information comes to light that may be material to this assessment, UEFA will use that to challenge the figures and will seek explanation, clarification or rebuttal from the club concerned.\u201d\n\nAbu Dhabi United Group was also alleged to be sending cash to a shell vehicle which was created to supposedly buy the right to use players\u2019 images in marketing campaigns. This helped raise revenue by 30 million euros in one case cited by Der Spiegel, which reported City\u2019s emails from 2013.\n\nCity has not commented on its use of the Fordham Sports Management image rights company or attempts to shift costs away from the club.\n\nRoberto Mancini, who managed City from 2009-13 and won the Premier League in 2012, was also shown to have received more pay from a team Sheikh Mansour owns in Abu Dhabi than from the Manchester club. Der Spiegel shows Mancini signed two contracts at the same time, to receive a base salary of 1.45 million pounds from City and 1.45 million pounds and 1.75 million pounds for advising Al Jazira Sports.\n\nSince July 2011, UEFA has monitored the annual accounts of all clubs entering its two club competitions. The first period UEFA assessed clubs for compliance with FFP was 2011-13 when owners were allowed to cover losses up to 45 million euros.\n\nUEFA requires clubs to approach break-even on football-related business \u2014 television rights fees, buying and selling players, salaries, sponsor deals, tickets sales, prize money. The complex accounting rules encourage clubs to spend on long-term projects \u2014 stadiums, youth training \u2014 which do not count as losses for FFP purposes.\n\n\u201cFinancial Fair Play has led to a step change in the health of the finances in European club football,\u201d UEFA said on Monday. \u201cSeven years ago, European clubs had a cumulative debt of 1.7 billion euros. Last year it was a profit of 600 million euros. Without question, it has been a success for the game across Europe.\u201d\n\nQatar-owned Paris Saint-Germain was sanctioned for overspending in 2014 at the same time as City. The Spanish soccer league last year asked UEFA to investigate City and PSG, claiming they benefit from state aid which \u201cdistorts European competitions\u201d and \u201cis irreparably harming the football industry.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Tennessee Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota (8) leaves the field after the Titans beat the New England Patriots in an NFL football game Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, in Nashville, Tenn.

It\u2019s nice to build off of it. It\u2019s a great win for us. But, this is not where we want to be and not where we want to go. So, we have to continue to work.\u201d\n\nThree-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman Jurrell Casey said beating last year\u2019s Super Bowl teams doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201cWe got to keep on building week in and week out and get ready for the next opponent coming up next week,\u201d Casey said.\n\nThat\u2019s a very different tone than the one they had after knocking off the Eagles.\n\nThere were demands for respect issued by two-time Pro Bowl left tackle Taylor Lewan and 2017 All-Pro safety Kevin Byard after the Titans knocked off the Eagles on Sept. 30. Then they went on the three-game skid.\n\nSo rookie head coach Mike Vrabel said after the win over the Patriots that he must do a better job helping the Titans handle success than the last time.\n\nOn Monday, Vrabel said keeping the Titans focused will be easy. All he has to do is start ticking off all the things the Colts (4-5) are doing well: winning three straight, averaging 29 points a game and not allowing a sack in three games.\n\n\u201cFor me, to try to stand up here and make something up, I won\u2019t have to do that ...,\u201d Vrabel said. \u201cSo, it won\u2019t be hard for me to look for clips of Indianapolis playing good football.\u201d\n\nThe Titans (5-4) also have never beaten Andrew Luck, losing all nine games against the quarterback. They swept the Colts last season for the first time since 2002; Luck missed both games with a shoulder injury that put him on injured reserve.\n\nTennessee\u2019s offense has been showing signs of growth in the Titans\u2019 last two wins and is coming off its best performance under first-year coordinator Matt LaFleur. The Titans scored touchdowns on their first two drives for the first time this season and scored a season-high 17 points in the first quarter and nearly matched their previous best in a game by halftime with 24.\n\nThat pairs nicely with the NFL\u2019s stingiest scoring defense, now allowing only 16.8 points per game. The Titans also rank sixth in total yards allowed, 10th against the run and sixth against the pass.\n\nThe Titans, who lost three losses by a combined nine points, visit the Colts and then division leader Houston before finishing the season with four of their final five games at home where they are 3-1 this season. Tight end Jonnu Smith says they have to keep stacking wins.\n\n\u201cIt means nothing if we can\u2019t keep the momentum and get the win the next week,\u201d Smith said.\n\nNotes: Vrabel said RB David Fluellen did not tear an ACL when he went down untouched, but will be out this week.\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

(Austin Anthony/Daily News via AP)\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) \u2014 The Patriots have been adept at masking most of their issues this season.\n\nAfter a 1-2 start by New England that seemed to offer at least a sliver of opportunity for someone to end its streak of nine straight AFC East titles, it hushed those rumblings by running off six straight victories.\n\nBut recent injuries, mounting issues on the offensive line and mistakes on defense returned during a 34-10 loss at Tennessee on Sunday.\n\nIt left coach Bill Belichick with a refrain he repeated both after the game and again Monday when asked for his assessment.\n\n\u201cNone of it was good enough,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s also brought back a small cloud of uncertainty about the prospects of a team that now enters its bye week facing the task of playing catch-up to a 9-1 Kansas City Chiefs team for home-field advantage in the AFC playoffs.\n\n\u201cYou better learn from a game like this, because the weeks get harder and harder,\u201d receiver Julian Edelman said following Sunday\u2019s loss. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to fix it because this is when you start separating or you start falling behind.\u201d\n\nTom Brady put together an MVP season in 2017 despite losing Edelman to a preseason knee injury. He was able to do it largely because of the strong seasons from tight end Rob Gronkowski, running back Dion Lewis and receiver Brandin Cooks.\n\nAnd despite a slow start, the defense was strong down the stretch, ending the regular season allowing just 18.5 points per game.\n\nFast-forward to 2018 and so much has changed following roster changes in the offseason.\n\nLewis signed with the Titans in free agency, creating a hole at running back that the Patriots have had trouble plugging. Cooks was traded and Brady has yet to develop consistent chemistry with a revamped group of receivers that has also had injuries.\n\nAs a result, Brady spent a good portion his 300th career NFL game Sunday under increasing pressure. He was sacked three times and hurried a total of six times by the Titans. He\u2019s only been sacked 16 times this season, but he\u2019s working harder in the pocket.\n\nBrady already has seven interceptions in 2018, one fewer than he had in all of 2017. They haven\u2019t all been the result of pressure from the defense. But he\u2019s had more overthrows working behind an increasingly injury-battered line that may be missing the leadership of free agency departure Nate Solder at left tackle.\n\nTrent Brown, who the Patriots acquired to fill Solder\u2019s spot, has started all 10 games and been solid. But he\u2019s now part of a growing list of offensive linemen nursing injuries.\n\nBrown missed the final drive of the first half against the Titans because of illness. LaAdrian Waddle replaced him for that series, with Brown returning early in the third quarter. But Brown left again with an injured back.\n\nEven more concerning for the Patriots (7-3) was the sight of Edelman leaving with an ankle injury. Gronkowski, who sat out Sunday, has now missed two of the last three games with ankle and back injuries. His backup, Dwayne Allen, could also miss some time after injuring his knee against Tennessee.\n\nBrady tried to lean on Josh Gordon, who has shined in recent weeks since his trade from Cleveland. But Gordon had just four catches on 12 targets against the Titans.\n\nIt added up to Brady being held without a touchdown pass for the second time in three weeks. His passer rating is down from 102.8 last season to 94.8 this season.\n\nDefensively there are concerns, too. After finding a groove in the second half of 2017, the Patriots haven\u2019t quite turned the same corner with linebacker coach Brian Flores calling plays following the departure of former defensive coordinator Matt Patricia. They are allowing 24 points and giving up 381 yards per game and continue to struggle with mobile quarterbacks.\n\nBrady said this upcoming bye week must feature a lot of self-assessment.\n\n\u201cI think the coaches will do a lot of self-scouting. I think we as players have to do the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully we learn from it. All of these games are a little bit different. ... The ones that we\u2019re going to play will be a little bit different. Winning football takes a lot of things. It takes a lot of good performances from a lot of people. Losing football is the exact opposite.\n\n\u201cWinning in the NFL is hard. You can\u2019t just show up expecting to win.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Kyle Hightower on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/khightower", "", "", "", "ASHBURN, Va.

(AP Photo/Alonzo Adams)\n\nNORMAN, Okla. (AP) \u2014 There might be something to Oklahoma\u2019s \u201cChampionship November\u201d mantra.\n\nThe Sooners have won 15 consecutive November games dating to the 2014 season. They already have won two games this November heading into Saturday\u2019s game against Kansas.\n\n\u201cCoaches preach it,\u201d receiver Marquise Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s big around here, football in November. That\u2019s where football championships are won. You have to get through November to get to where you want to be. We take big pride in playing games in November.\u201d\n\nThe late-season success, fueled by coach Lincoln Riley\u2019s high-powered offenses, has helped Oklahoma claim three consecutive Big 12 titles and make two trips to the College Football Playoff. The sixth-ranked Sooners believe they can make another run at both this season.\n\n\u201cWe know what\u2019s at stake,\u201d Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray said. \u201cWe can\u2019t lose a game. We don\u2019t want to lose a game. The standard around Oklahoma is to go as far as possible. For us, that\u2019s obviously win a Big 12 Championship and see where that puts us, and we know that. I think that\u2019s just what keeps us humble and keep working hard.\u201d\n\nGRINDING IT OUT\n\nQuarterback Baker Mayfield won the Heisman last season and Murray is a strong contender this season. They have combined to start all but two of the games. Yet, the Sooners are averaging 289.4 yards rushing during the streak while averaging 6.2 yards per carry. Oklahoma has averaged 47 rush attempts to 27 pass attempts, showing a willingness to pound the ball and take pressure off its quarterbacks.\n\nEFFICIENT PASSING\n\nOklahoma has completed nearly 68 percent of its passes during the streak. When you combine a strong, steady running game with efficient, Heisman-caliber quarterbacks, you get something like this: 576.9 yards and 46.9 points per game. Mayfield has set the NCAA single-season passer efficiency record each of the past two seasons, and Murray is having an even more efficient season this year.\n\nSPECTACULAR PERFORMANCES\n\nOklahoma has set its single-game records for rushing, passing and receiving yardage during this run. Samaje Perine\u2019s 427-yard performance against Kansas in 2014 remains the FBS rushing record for a game. Last season against Oklahoma State, Mayfield passed for a school-record 598 yards and Brown had a school-best 265 yards receiving.\n\nWINNING THE CLOSE ONES\n\nWhen things have gotten shaky, the Sooners have made critical defensive plays. In 2015, when Oklahoma lost most of its lead against TCU, Steven Parker batted away a pass on a 2-point conversion with 51 seconds remaining to help the Sooners hold on for a 30-29 victory. Two weeks ago, Robert Barnes ran back an interception on a 2-point conversion for two critical points in the fourth quarter of a 51-46 win over Texas Tech. Last week, Oklahoma State pulled to within 48-47 with 1:03 remaining, but Tre Brown got his hand on Taylor Cornelius\u2019 2-point conversion pass, and the Sooners held on.\n\nMINIMIZING MISTAKES\n\nOklahoma has forced 27 turnovers while committing just 15 during the streak. The Sooners have lost the turnover battle just three times in those games. Oklahoma has allowed 27.6 points in those contests, which isn\u2019t horrible by Big 12 standards, and certainly more than enough help for Riley\u2019s offenses.\n\n___\n\nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "GREAT FALLS, Mont.

(AP Photo/David Banks)\n\nLAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) \u2014 This time, the Chicago Bears were good enough to overcome a tough day for Cody Parkey.\n\nThat might not be the case very soon.\n\nA day after Parkey missed two extra points and two field-goal attempts in a 34-22 victory over Detroit, coach Matt Nagy reiterated he has no plans to take a look at another kicker this week. But he acknowledged Parkey\u2019s performance is only going to take on greater importance as the NFC North-leading Bears try to get back to the playoffs for the first time since after the 2010 season.\n\n\u201cThe end of this regular season, these are huge now. You got to make them,\u201d Nagy said Monday, \u201cand it\u2019s just too important, they\u2019re too crucial.\u201d\n\nThe most remarkable part of Parkey\u2019s trouble against Detroit might have been how he missed the four kicks, finding an upright each time.\n\nAfter Chicago scored on its first drive, Parkey kicked the extra point off the right upright. He hit the left upright on an extra point in the second quarter. On consecutive Chicago drives in the third quarter, Parkey rattled the right upright on a 41-yard field goal and again on a 34-yard attempt.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve hit the post four times in my whole life and I\u2019ve been kicking probably for 15 years,\u201d Parkey said right after Chicago\u2019s third straight win.\n\nIt got so bad that the crowd roared when the Bears went for a 2-point conversion after a touchdown later in the third. But Parkey\u2019s teammates offered their support.\n\n\u201cEveryone has a bad game every once in a while, so we\u2019re going to rally around him, continue to have his back,\u201d quarterback Mitchell Trubisky said, \u201cand I know next week when we need it he\u2019s going to make a big kick and we\u2019re not even going to think twice about it. We\u2019re a family in that locker room, we have each other\u2019s back no matter what.\u201d\n\nParkey connected on 21 of 23 field-goal attempts and 26 of 29 extra points last season with Miami, prompting Chicago to give him a four-year deal in free agency worth a little more than $15 million. It included a signing bonus of $2.25 million and a fully guaranteed base salary for the first two years, making it unlikely the Bears will cut him.\n\nThe 26-year-old Parkey has missed five field goals in 18 attempts this season. The empty extra points were his first two in 32 tries.\n\nNagy chalked up the performance to a bad day.\n\n\u201cYou go back to a few weeks ago when Mason Crosby missed a few for Green Bay and then the next week he ended up kicking the game winner,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a crazy cycle and it\u2019s just a matter of your patience that you have with it and fortunately for us yesterday we did have the lead. ... But now, he also needs to take the next step of trying to figure out how he can get better and we\u2019ll go ahead and do that.\u201d\n\nOne way might be some practice time at Soldier Field, one of the NFL\u2019s toughest spots for kickers because of its proximity to Lake Michigan. Nagy said they are discussing the possibility.\n\nHow quickly Parkey can recover from his difficulties against Detroit could be huge for Chicago (6-3), which hosts Minnesota on Sunday night. The Vikings have won four of five and are second in the division with a 5-3-1 record.\n\nThe Bears and Lions play again on Thanksgiving in Detroit, and Chicago also hosts Green Bay and visits Minnesota before the season ends. Asked about balancing support for Parkey with any frustration with his performance, Nagy said he believes in being honest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to sugarcoat anything and he wouldn\u2019t want that from me,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll have our own conversations and keep it between us, but I\u2019ll always handle it as best as I can for the team and for him and then just stick with my gut.\u201d\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "FILE - In this Nov. 25, 2017, file photo, Oklahoma head coach Lincoln Riley, left, and West Virginia head coach Dana Holgorsen, right, talk after their NCAA college football game in Norman, Okla.

There is no possible scenario that could create a championship game rematch between the teams currently tied for third place.\n\nThe Cyclones have won five Big 12 games in a row for the first time in school history.

(AP) \u2014 Hazelnut growers in Oregon were anticipating a record-high crop in 2018, although it appears the harvest is coming in short of expectations.\n\nThe Capital Press reported Monday that the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service predicted 52,000 tons of hazelnuts in August, which would have beaten the previous record of 49,500 tons in 2001.\n\nInstead, local processors say they are looking at between 46,000 to 48,000 tons, which is higher than last year\u2019s 32,000 tons but still not on par with increases in handling capacity.\n\nLarry George, president and CEO of George Packing Company in Newberg, said he doesn\u2019t know exactly why hazelnut yields did not meet record forecasts.\n\nHe said it looks like one of the primary new nut varieties, called Jefferson, did not perform as well as previously thought when the orchards were planted in 2007.\n\nGeorge said it is also possible growers harvested fewer early season orchards due to low prices caused by economic turmoil overseas, including Chinese tariffs and currency devaluation in Turkey, the world\u2019s leading producer of hazelnuts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll know in a few weeks,\u201d he said.\n\nWhatever the explanation, a lesser hazelnut crop doesn\u2019t bode well for processors such as George Packing Company, which has invested millions of dollars to increase capacity.\n\nHazelnut acreage has approximately doubled in Oregon over the past decade, up to 72,353 acres, spurred by new varieties such as Jefferson, Yamhill and McDonald that are resistant to Eastern Filbert Blight.\n\nWith the growth in acreage, George said there was a rush to expand alongside the orchards. Nearly all U.S. commercial hazelnuts are grown in Oregon, and George Packing Company is the industry\u2019s largest processor and marketer.\n\nPatrick Gabrish, vice president of sales and marketing for Hazelnut Growers of Oregon, a member-owned co-op representing 150 local hazelnut farmers, said he\u2019s not overly concerned about lower yields. He pointed out that 33,000 acres of orchards still have not reached nut-bearing age. When they do, he said the spike in volume may help to stabilize prices and develop new markets.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be plenty of crop to work with over the next few years,\u201d Gabrish said.\n\nBoth Gabrish and George raved about this year\u2019s crop quality, aided by a dry harvest season that minimized mud and mold. Months of drought, however, also emphasized the need for growers to adopt irrigation and nutrient programs to maximize yields through difficult summers.\n\nThis year was already challenging for the hazelnut industry as global factors combined to drive down prices for growers. First, China slapped 15 percent and 25 percent retaliatory tariffs on the product from the U.S. in response to the Trump administration\u2019s escalating trade war. Then, the Turkish lira plummeted in value, allowing the country to flood the market with cheap hazelnuts.\n\nFor the first time, growers accepted a three-tier price system at 62 cents per pound for in-shell hazelnut varieties, and between 81 and 91 cents per pound for \u201cshell-out\u201d varieties, which command more value for larger kernels.\n\nThat is lower than last year\u2019s price of 96.5 cents per pound for all hazelnuts, and $1.18 per pound in 2016.\n\nTerry Ross, executive director of the Hazelnut Growers Bargaining Association, said the system was meant to encourage growers to plant more shell-out varieties to tap into newer and potentially more lucrative markets.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of potential,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThe future is bright.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Capital Press, http://www.capitalpress.com/washington", "DURHAM, N.H.

The Wolverines have won nine straight since losing to No. 3 Notre Dame and need another win to set up a showdown with No. 9 Ohio State for a ticket to the Big Ten championship game.\n\nAllen, of course, also knows the refrain echoing throughout his home state: Indiana hasn\u2019t won at Michigan since 1967.\n\nNone of it matters to the Hoosiers, who ended a four-game losing streak Saturday and now need one more win to become bowl-eligible.\n\n\u201cWe changed our schedule for the very purpose of being at our best in weeks nine, 10, 11 and 12,\u201d Allen said Monday. \u201cWe really felt like last year for multiple reasons, it wasn\u2019t just one thing, but for multiple reasons we kind of ran out of juice and did not have the same energy at the end.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s victory over Maryland should give the Hoosiers (5-5, 2-5 Big Ten) more than just an energy boost.\n\nThey desperately needed a home win to build some momentum for the home stretch and to give themselves a realistic chance of becoming bowl-eligible for the third time in four years.\n\nAllen made points perfectly clear to his players last week when he decided to discuss the postseason situation, something he did not do in 2017. Indiana responded to Allen\u2019s message by using Steve Scott\u2019s long run to set up a 42-yard field goal with 2:32 left and a force a late turnover to close out a crucial 34-32 victory over Maryland on Saturday.\n\nNow comes the harder part, winning No. 6 either at Michigan this weekend or at home against bitter rival Purdue in their home finale.\n\n\u201cAnxious for our guys to respond in the right way to be able to build off of this and take momentum into the biggest game of our season,\u201d Allen said. \u201cOur guys understand that.\u201d\n\nFor programs like Indiana\u2019s, this time of the season can be quite challenging as speculation runs rampant about bowl destinations and coaching changes.\n\nJust ask Purdue (5-5, 4-3), which is in a similar predicament in part for a very different reason.\n\nThe Boilermakers also need one win to become bowl-eligible and host Wisconsin (6-4, 4-3) on Saturday before visiting Bloomington the following week for a potential winner-takes-all regular-season finale.\n\nThe chatter around Purdue became more complicated after Louisville fired coach Bobby Petrino on Sunday and Boilermakers coach Jeff Brohm immediately jumped to the top of his alma mater\u2019s wish list. Brohm was peppered with questions about the opening Monday and tried to downplay the rumors emanating from his hometown.\n\n\u201cI have a job, and we\u2019ve got work to do, and a lot of it. We\u2019re going to put forth the effort to do that,\u201d Brohm said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a tough opponent this week, and then we\u2019ve got to go to IU, and we\u2019re going to have to play well, and we\u2019re going to have to play much better than we did last week. So I\u2019m going to stay focused on that, and I\u2019m very appreciative of the job I have right now.\u201d\n\nBrohm has become a frequently mentioned candidate on the coaching carrousel, especially after beating expectations each of his first two seasons at Purdue. Last year, he led the Boilermakers to a bowl game victory and last month Purdue blew out Ohio State in one of this season\u2019s most shocking upsets.\n\nBut Allen, like Brohm, has only one goal this week: Beating a good opponent this weekend so they don\u2019t have to fret over the stakes next weekend.\n\n\u201cWe know what they\u2019ve accomplished this year,\u201d Allen said, describing Michigan. \u201cThey\u2019re really playing at a high level, and coach (Jim) Harbaugh\u2019s got them doing a lot of great things.

Newly emboldened Democrats are in no mood to cooperate over wall money. Instead, they\u2019ll be pushing to protect special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe from acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, who has criticized the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. All sides must agree to a federal funding bill to prevent a partial government shutdown from beginning on Dec. 7.\n\n\u201cHouse Democrats are anything but lame ducks,\u201d Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi wrote Monday to colleagues, saying Democrats are \u201cflying high and taking pride\u201d in the greatest Democratic sweep of the House since the Watergate election of 1974. They picked up at least 32 seats, with several races still undecided.\n\n\u201cWe have great opportunity, and therefore great responsibility to get results for the American people,\u201d Pelosi wrote. Democrats \u201cneed to be unified, find common ground with Republicans in our legislative engagements, but stand our ground when we must.\u201d\n\nAgainst this backdrop, dozens of new House lawmakers and a handful of new senators arrived for a whirlwind orientation session. They will take their official photos, meet colleagues and take what could prove to be the toughest vote of their early careers \u2014 electing their leadership. Several new Congressional Progressive Caucus members held their first press conference Monday.\n\n\u201cI hope that we are ushering in a new era,\u201d said Rep.-elect Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.\n\nTheir majority lost, House Republicans will start the task of rebuilding. Retiring Speaker Paul Ryan will begin to transition out of power and next-in-line Kevin McCarthy of California is favored over conservative Rep. Jim Jordan, a leader of the Freedom Caucus, to win the job of incoming minority leader in leadership elections Wednesday. GOP Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana is expected keep his spot unchallenged. And new to leadership will be Rep. Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, in the No. 3 position of conference chair.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to change the way that we operate and really in some ways be more aggressive,\u201d Cheney, running unopposed, told The Associated Press.\n\nSenators will also select their leaders, but few surprises are expected. On the Democratic side, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York is set to return as leader, even though the party lost several seats in the election.\n\nSchumer suggested Democrats would use the lame duck session to fight to protect special counsel. \u201cPeople are really concerned about this,\u201d Schumer told CNN.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has predicted a \u201clively\u201d lame duck session. He has said legislation to protect Mueller is \u201cunnecessary\u201d because the investigation is \u201cnot under threat.\u201d\n\nMcConnell is poised to again lead Republicans, but term limits are pushing GOP Whip John Cornyn of Texas out of the No. 2 spot, making way for South Dakota Sen. John Thune to move up. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso and Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri will round out the team, and Cornyn will still have a seat at McConnell\u2019s table of counselors.\n\nMcConnell is also trying to add a female senator to a lower leadership spot, seeking to address the optics of having an all-male leadership slate in a year that brought a record number of women to Congress.\n\nThe biggest leadership race is Pelosi\u2019s bid to return as the first female House speaker, a contest she says she\u2019s \u201c100 percent\u201d confident she will win despite a public campaign by some incumbent and newly elected Democrats to oust her. Preliminary voting won\u2019t unfold for House Democrats until after Thanksgiving.\n\nAmid the leadership shuffle, lawmakers have several pieces of legislation they want to finish by year\u2019s end, including a farm policy bill and legislation overhauling Congress\u2019 handling of sexual harassment claims. The Senate will try to confirm more of Trump\u2019s judicial and administrative nominees, including a vote this week on Michelle Bowman to be a member of the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors.\n\nBut first they appeared headed toward a showdown over Trump\u2019s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump spent weeks ahead of the midterm election rallying fears over a migrant caravan heading toward the border and promised voters that Republicans would bring tougher border security.\n\nHouse Republicans have already approved $5 billion for Trump\u2019s wall, but in the Senate, where Republicans need Democratic support to prevent a filibuster, a bipartisan bill allocates $1.6 billion.\n\nMcCarthy upped the stakes by introducing legislation for the full $25 billion the White House wants in border funds as he tries to shore up support from conservatives ahead of the GOP leadership election.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how hard Republicans will be willing to fight for the wall, given that dozens of House GOP lawmakers are serving their final days in Congress after retiring or losing their re-election races. Ryan had promised a \u201cbig fight\u201d over the border money and McConnell said a mini-shutdown may be necessary to help Trump \u201cget what he\u2019s looking for\u201d on the wall.\n\nRep. Nita Lowey of New York, who is set to chair the House Appropriations Committee, said Democrats \u201chave our boxing gloves on\u201d to spar with Trump and other Republicans.\n\nThe top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations panel, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, on Monday told reporters Trump is the only person in Washington who seems to want to a shutdown.\n\nFirefighters battling California wildfires, police officers and other emergency responders all would be hurt by a shutdown, he said.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot)\n\nCOSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Chargers have had to make plenty of adjustments this season on defense due to injuries and suspensions. They will have to make another with one of their leading tacklers lost for the remainder of the year.\n\nCoach Anthony Lynn said Monday that linebacker Denzel Perryman injured the lateral collateral ligament in his left knee during the first quarter of Sunday\u2019s 20-6 win against Oakland and will undergo surgery. The 5-foot-11, 240-pound inside linebacker had started every game this season and was second in tackles with 51 going into the Raiders game.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely a blow to our defense. When Denzel is on the roster he is a difference-maker,\u201d Lynn said.\n\nPerryman is one of the team\u2019s top defenders against the run with 15 stuffs (tackles on running plays for no gain or a loss). Los Angeles is ranked 17th in the league against the run. It has allowed only one running back to rush for over 100 yards (the Rams\u2019 Todd Gurley in Week 3) but the Chargers have been inconsistent.\n\nThe Chargers are allowing an average of 133.8 yards per game on the ground over the past four games, which is 22 yards more than their season average.\n\nThe one area where they have made improvement is in the pass rush. They have 15 sacks in the past four games and have four interceptions.\n\n\u201cWe have done a better job at stopping the explosive plays. As we stop passes going over our heads our defense has been playing a lot better,\u201d cornerback Desmond King said.\n\nPerryman has been unable to remain healthy during his four years in the league. He missed four games in 2016 due to hamstring and knee injuries and did not play in the first eight games last season after suffering an ankle injury in the preseason. He was drafted in the second round in 2015 and is in the final year of his contract.\n\nPerryman is the second Chargers linebacker who has been placed on IR. Kyzir White, who started the first three games at one of the outside spots, was placed on injured reserve on Nov. 3 due to a knee injury. The team has not ruled out the possibility that he may return by the end of the year since it has not used its designated-to-return spot.\n\nHayes Pullard and Kyle Emanuel, who both saw 16 snaps against Oakland, are in the mix to move into Perryman\u2019s starting spot. Pullard started 10 games last season after being claimed off waivers and posted a career-high 79 tackles.\n\nDefensive end Joey Bosa has missed the season due to a foot injury, but he has made progress in his rehab. Lynn said Monday that there isn\u2019t a timetable for Bosa\u2019s return, but he did not completely rule him out for this week\u2019s game against Denver.\n\nThe Chargers have won six straight despite their injury woes, which is their longest winning streak since they took 11 straight in 2009.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "High school placed on lockdown after officer shoots himself\n\nTOWSON, Md.

(AP) \u2014 The Jacksonville Jaguars are busting defensive assignments at an alarming rate.\n\nThey are allowing receivers to get wide open across the field. They are letting tight ends go completely uncovered. They are missing calls, failing to communicate coverages and giving up explosive plays left and right.\n\nA defense that believed it could be generational a few months ago looks mostly generic the last few weeks.\n\nThe Jaguars (3-6) gave up 29 points and 306 yards in the first half to Indianapolis and lost 29-26 on Sunday . The Colts managed just 60 yards after the break, but dropped two passes that would have resulted in big gains.\n\nRegardless, Jacksonville lost its fifth consecutive game and pretty much ruined its already slim chances of returning to the postseason. Inconsistent quarterback Blake Bortles and a growing number of injuries are partly to blame. But equally troubling is how the once-vaunted defense has fallen well short of expectations.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say what\u2019s going on in the next man\u2019s head,\u201d safety Tashaun Gipson said Monday. \u201cWe go over our in-game adjustments.

Ramsey played zone later in the first quarter when he should been in man, allowing Hilton to get loose for a 35-yard gain.\n\nRamsey also got burned for a touchdown by tight end Mo Alie-Cox.\n\nRamsey responded to criticism Monday via Twitter by saying, \u201cWhen I\u2019m gone from here, y\u2019all gone miss me.

Known as Armistice Day, the event became an official U.S. holiday to remember the contributions of those who had fought in the war, and in 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower expanded its scope to commemorate the service of all U.S. veterans, renaming it Veterans Day.\n\nSince the days of the American Revolution, the U.S. has owed a great debt to its service members, one not quantifiable in any list of victories or policy accomplishments. An incredible 16.1 million U.S. veterans are alive today who have served in at least one war, from World War II to Afghanistan. Alaska has the highest number of veterans per capita of any U.S. state; one in 10 Alaskans is a veteran.\n\nAlaska has always depended heavily upon the contributions of veterans \u2014 even before its military infrastructure was expanded during World War II, the first World War was a massive influence on the territory. When the U.S. signaled it would join the war effort in Europe, many of the young men who worked on small mining claims in Alaska went Outside to enlist. A total of 10,000 Alaskans enlisted, some of whom died in service to their country. Others perished in the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, and some never returned to Alaska upon completing their service. The combined effect of the war and the flu devastated the territory, decimating some towns and accelerating the move toward corporate mining.\n\nThe story of veterans in Alaska can\u2019t be told in numbers. It\u2019s better expressed in stories like that of Alaska-born Medal of Honor recipient Archie Van Winkle. A staff sergeant in the Korean War, Van Winkle and his unit came under attack by a larger North Korean force. He \u201cboldly spearheaded a determined attack through withering fire,\u201d Van Winkle\u2019s citation reads, going on to say that \u201cthough he and all the others who charged with him were wounded, (he) succeeded in enabling his platoon to gain the fire superiority and the opportunity to reorganize.\u201d Wounded in the arm and chest from enemy fire and a hand grenade, \u201che staunchly refused evacuation and continued to shout orders and words of encouragement to his depleted and battered platoon.\u201d\n\nAlaska has ties to other Medal of Honor recipients with similarly harrowing stories \u2014 Drew Dix, who earned his medal as a staff sergeant in Vietnam, finished his service at Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks and retired in the Interior, where he still lives. And medical sergeant Ronald J. Shurer, born in Fairbanks, was awarded the Medal of Honor earlier this year for his heroism in a 2008 battle in which he saved the lives of four critically wounded U.S. soldiers and 10 injured Afghan commandos until teammates arrived.\n\nCasualty counts have fallen in recent conflicts as the U.S. military shifts to tactics and technology that limits exposure of large masses of troops to enemy fire. But in some regards, war never changes. Our understanding of the effects of combat service on veterans is increasing, but we still suffer major deficits in our ability to treat not just physical wounds but also post-traumatic stress disorder and the psychological burden of war. We must continue to do better for those who have done their best for us.\n\nA century after the \u201cwar to end all wars,\u201d it\u2019s clear that war has not and will not end, despite our continuing, essential pursuit of that goal. Whether their service is performed fighting the wars we cannot avoid or deterring the ones we can, America\u2019s veterans are owed a great debt by our nation, and one that we should remember on this day and all others.\n\n___\n\nNov. 10, 2018\n\nFairbanks Daily News-Miner: Time to put university lands in its own hands\n\nThe subject of transferring more state land to the University of Alaska so that the university can manage it as a revenue source to supplement its budget shouldn\u2019t seem like a controversial subject. The university has been managing land for revenue for years.\n\nAnd yet the idea of giving more land to the university has proved time and again to be a difficult task.\n\nGov.-elect Mike Dunleavy, in a wide-ranging meeting with the Daily News-Miner editorial board two weeks before the election, discussed giving more state land to the university. He\u2019s clearly a strong supporter of the idea and seems unfazed by the prospect of environmental groups filing lawsuits to block any such transfer.\n\nA governor doesn\u2019t have the authority to unilaterally transfer land to the university. The transfer would have to first be in the form of a bill approved by the Legislature and then sent to the governor for signing. And that\u2019s where previous land transfers to the university have fallen apart.\n\nFormer Gov. Tony Knowles, who served from 1994 to 2002, vetoed university lands legislation three times. The Legislature overrode his third veto, in 2000, but Gov. Knowles refused to recognize the override, saying it required a three-quarters vote of the joint Legislature because the lands transfer was akin to an appropriations bill, which under the Alaska Constitution require the higher veto override threshold. The Legislature\u2019s override was on a vote of 41-19, however, barely achieving the two-thirds total required to override nonappropriations bills.\n\nThe Legislature sued to force Gov. Knowles to recognize the veto override and to implement the land transfer, and the case found its way to the Alaska Supreme Court, which ruled in the Legislature\u2019s favor. The Alaska Center for the Environment, the Northern Alaska Environmental Center, and the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council also became involved.\n\nNearly four years had passed from the date of the governor\u2019s veto to the date of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\nSo you can clearly see that university lands bills are easily contentious.\n\nBut that shouldn\u2019t stop the new governor and the next Legislature from trying.\n\nAnd Gov.-elect Dunleavy doesn\u2019t seem to be one who will shy from a fight.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s got to be a discussion with folks in the state of Alaska,\u201d Mr. Dunleavy said in his meeting with the Daily News-Miner editorial board. \u201cIf we want these programs, we have to be able to produce revenue to support these programs. And if we have land that we can monetize, that has minerals on it, timber on it, you name it, we should be able to do that. That was the purpose of the land, especially for things like the university and the Mental Health Trust Fund.\n\n\u201cSo some of these same groups that are suing and preventing that land from being monetized are some of the same people that want more spending in programs,\u201d he said. \u201cWell how do you get that? Just take it from you and give it to him when we have all these possibilities in terms of resource development? So that\u2019s what I would do with university: Sit down with them, work with them on identifying land, and getting ready for the lawsuits I guess that people would send our way.\u201d\n\nThe University of Alaska needs more land. It should have more land.\n\nA 1993 report by Terrence Cole, chairman the University of Alaska Fairbanks History Department at the time, includes a history of the university\u2019s land grants. It explains how the university\u2019s land grant fell victim to Alaska statehood:\n\n\u201cWith the passage of the Alaska statehood bill in 1958, the university\u2019s legal rights to further land under the 1915 (land grant) reservation were extinguished. The statehood act repealed the 1915 reservation because Congress apparently believed the enormous statehood entitlement of more than 103 million acres \u2014 far larger than that of any other state in American history \u2014 would provide sufficient resources so that the 49th state could adequately support its university.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlaska Delegate E.L. \u2018Bob\u2019 Bartlett agreed with the majority of Congress that by not targeting specific amounts of land for specific purposes, such as had traditionally been done for the support of higher education elsewhere, the new state would have greater flexibility and more control of its own affairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the cost of this greater freedom in land choice was a vastly smaller educational land grant for Alaska.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s one important caution that should accompany any effort to give the university more land for income generation, however: It can take a long time for any additional land to lead to actual income, so legislators and the governor shouldn\u2019t think they can reduce the university\u2019s budget instantly, if that is indeed their intention in giving the university more land. The university\u2019s budget has been cut several times in recent years already.\n\nWith that point acknowledged, let\u2019s hope the next governor and next Legislature can agree on a plan to get more land into the university\u2019s hands.", "FILE - In this Thursday, Oct. 4, 2018 file photo, Los Angeles Dodgers starting pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu throws to an Atlanta Braves batter during the first inning of Game 1 of a baseball National League Division Series in Los Angeles.

(AP Photo/Butch Dill)\n\nSTARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) \u2014 Mississippi State\u2019s regular season has 10 days remaining and the schedule includes two winnable games against Arkansas and Ole Miss.\n\nBut no matter the outcome, the Bulldogs\u2019 season has fallen short of expectations.\n\nThis was supposed to be the year that Mississippi State challenged for its first Southeastern Conference championship in more than 75 years. Instead, the 25th-ranked Bulldogs (6-4, 2-4 SEC, No. 16 CFP) are in fifth place.\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt it\u2019s been a rocky first season for coach Joe Moorhead.\n\n\u201cI know there was an elevated expectation level heading into this season for a myriad of reasons,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cFrom a historical context, we\u2019re battling to get where we\u2019ve never been since 1941. I understand the disappointment because of the expectation level, but reality is reality.\u201d\n\nAnd the reality is that Mississippi State offense hasn\u2019t been able to generate enough points to be a true threat against the SEC\u2019s elite teams. The Bulldogs have scored just 16 total points in their four league losses, including last weekend\u2019s 24-0 setback to No. 1 Alabama .\n\nMississippi State gained just 169 yards against the Tide and converted only 1 of 13 third-down opportunities.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to help you extend drives and put points on the board,\u201d Moorhead said.\n\nThe offense has been a constant source of frustration throughout the season. The combination of Moorhead \u2014 who had two excellent seasons as Penn State\u2019s offensive coordinator before coming to Starkville \u2014 and senior quarterback Nick Fitzgerald was supposed to help the Bulldogs put more points on the scoreboard.\n\nIt\u2019s never quite worked out.\n\nFitzgerald has completed just 51 percent of his passes, which is his lowest mark in three years as the starter. He\u2019s run for 816 yards, but is averaging just 4.8 yards per carry, which is also a career low.\n\nThe quarterback hasn\u2019t had much help from his receivers. Nobody on the roster has caught more than 22 passes this year and the Bulldogs have dropped several balls when there have been opportunities for big gains.\n\nMississippi State has scored just 11.2 points and averaged 272.3 total yards in its six conference games. Both rank last in the league by a wide margin.\n\nIf there\u2019s discord among the Bulldogs, it hasn\u2019t shown. Moorhead said it\u2019s been a \u201cpleasure\u201d to coach Fitzgerald, even if the results haven\u2019t always been what either of them wanted.\n\n\u201cSeeing him grow, seeing him embrace the things we\u2019re asking him to do, particularly things that are a little different than he\u2019s done things in the past,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cJust how he\u2019s handled prosperity and adversity.\u201d\n\nThe offensive struggles have been even more maddening because Mississippi State\u2019s defense is among the nation\u2019s best in several categories. The Bulldogs are giving up just 13.5 points per game.\n\n\u201cCertainly, with the type of defense we\u2019re playing, it would obviously behoove us to perform better (offensively) and put more points in the board in those games,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably part of being a first-year, new offensive system.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP .\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 .", "Pittsburgh running back Qadree Ollison (30) looks back at Virginia Tech defensive back Caleb Farley (3) as he makes a 97-yard-run for a touchdown in the fourth quarter of an NCAA football game, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh won 52-22.(AP Photo/Keith Srakocic)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Darrin Hall paused for a second and pondered the question. Fresh off a 186-yard performance in front of his infant daughter in a victory that catapulted Pittsburgh to the brink of its first appearance in the ACC championship game, the senior running back tried to put a finger on the last time so much came so easily.\n\n\u201cIt had to be Pop Warner when I was about 6 years old,\u201d Hall said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll try to keep it going.\u201d\n\nSo will the rest of the resurgent Panthers (6-4, 5-1 ACC), who have taken on a decidedly old-school persona while resurrecting their season. Pitt is averaging 410 yards rushing during its three-game winning streak, including a staggering 492 in a 52-22 dismantling of Virginia Tech on Saturday that moved the Panthers within one victory of capturing the typically chaotic ACC Coastal Division.\n\nIn an era when offenses have become increasingly diverse, the Panthers are going in another direction. Pitt is playing with a determined physicality on offense that eschews intricacy for something more basic. The Panthers snapped the ball 47 times against the Hokies. On 36 of those snaps, quarterback Kenny Pickett either handed the ball off \u2014 primarily to Hall or Qadree Ollison \u2014 or took off himself.\n\nThe way Pickett figures it, why not?\n\n\u201cThose are two of the best backs in the country, no doubt, and you add that with the line that we have, they\u2019re a dangerous group,\u201d Pickett said. \u201cYou feel real good having them two next to you or behind you in the backfield.\u201d\n\nOllison became the sixth player in program history to record multiple 1,000-yard rushing seasons after piling up 235 yards and three scores against Virginia Tech, 97 of them coming on a sprint down the right sideline for a fourth-quarter touchdown that marked the longest play from scrimmage ever for a school that\u2019s been playing football for 114 years.\n\nAnd yet all Ollison did afterward was marvel at the play of the offensive line \u2014 he had the starting five join him in the postgame news conference on Saturday \u2014 and Hall, his longtime backfield mate. The two have forged a unique friendship during their overlapping careers. Ollison has become the workhorse, meaning Hall\u2019s touches are somewhat limited.\n\nIt\u2019s what Hall is doing with those touches, however, that has drawn Ollison\u2019s admiration. Hall carried the ball just seven times against Virginia Tech and nearly topped 200 yards, forcing Ollison to do the math.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s 27 yards a carry,\u201d Ollison said. \u201cI was telling him, \u2018Save some long runs for me.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the moment, there are plenty to go around for the Panthers. Pitt averaged 13.6 yards per carry on Saturday. The Panthers are 10th in the country in yards rushing per game and do it while working out of a conventional set. No triple option. Little read option. Just line up, snap the ball and go.\n\n\u201cOur offense will be about as foreign to most teams in this conference ... because they don\u2019t get to see it every week,\u201d coach Pat Narduzzi said.\n\nMaybe, but 10 games in, very few secrets remain. Pitt has struggled throwing the ball all season, forcing the Panthers to rely heavily on the run to move the ball. Virginia Tech \u2014 much like every other team Pitt has played over the last five weeks while the Panthers righted their season \u2014 knew what was coming. And still, the Hokies couldn\u2019t stop it.\n\n\u201cIt goes down to the toughness part of the game, so if you\u2019re going to be a tough football team, you\u2019d better stop the run and run the football,\u201d Narduzzi said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we live in Pittsburgh, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here. That\u2019s what the Steelers are; that\u2019s what we are.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "DETROIT LAKES, Minn.

One reason for the team\u2019s sustained run of success has been the production by quarterback Shea Patterson\u2019s targets on the outside.\n\nLeading the way again Saturday was sophomore Donovan Peoples-Jones, who is fulfilling the five-star promise he brought to campus last season.\n\nPeoples-Jones arrived last season from Cass Tech, a Detroit powerhouse, catching 22 passes as a freshman for 277 yards and no receiving touchdowns. This season, he\u2019s caught seven touchdowns among his 30 grabs for 447 yards.\n\n\u201cJust playing with my teammates has been so much fun this year,\u201d Peoples-Jones said. \u201cAs a player, you want to be efficient. That\u2019s the name of the game. Doing what you got to do.\u201d\n\nHis touchdown on Sept. 8 against Western Michigan broke a run of 364 days without a TD catch from a Michigan wide receiver. A week later, against SMU, he caught three scores, helping ease the burden for the group and new wide receivers coach Jim McElwain, the former Florida head coach.\n\n\u201cHe can jump, run, catch, all those, just the stuff you can\u2019t teach,\u201d senior wide receiver Grant Perry said, adding that Peoples-Jones has grown this year in \u201cmaturity and being a leader as well, helping other guys.\u201d\n\nMaking matters easier is stability at quarterback.

Then, Black suffered a broken left foot in the third game and didn\u2019t return.\n\nThis year, the injury to the other foot occurred in the week leading up to the opener at Notre Dame, Michigan\u2019s only loss.

He was 95.\n\nLee was declared dead at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to Kirk Schenck, an attorney for Lee\u2019s daughter, J.C. Lee.\n\nAs the top writer at Marvel Comics and later as its publisher, Lee was widely considered the architect of the contemporary comic book. He revived the industry in the 1960s by offering the costumes and action craved by younger readers while insisting on sophisticated plots, college-level dialogue, satire, science fiction, even philosophy.\n\nMillions responded to the unlikely mix of realistic fantasy, and many of his characters, including Spider-Man, the Hulk and X-Men went on to become stars of blockbuster films. He won the National Medal of Arts in 2008.\n\nRecent projects Lee helped make possible range from the films \u201cAvengers: Infinity War,\u201d \u2033Black Panther\u201d and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d to such TV series as \u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D\u201d and \u201cDaredevil.\u201d Lee was recognizable to his fans, having had cameos in many Marvel films and TV projects, often delivering his trademark motto, \u201cExcelsior!\u201d\n\n\u201cCaptain America\u201d actor Chris Evans mourned the loss on Twitter: \u201cThere will never be another Stan Lee. For decades he provided both young and old with adventure, escape, comfort, confidence, inspiration, strength, friendship and joy. He exuded love and kindness and will leave an indelible mark on so, so, so many lives. Excelsior!!\u201d\n\nLee hit his stride in the 1960s when he brought the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, Spider-Man, Iron Man and numerous others to life. \u201cIt was like there was something in the air. I couldn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nHis heroes, meanwhile, were a far cry from virtuous do-gooders such as rival DC Comics\u2019 Superman.\n\nThe Fantastic Four fought with each other. Spider-Man was goaded into superhero work by his alter ego, Peter Parker, who suffered from unrequited crushes, money problems and dandruff. The Silver Surfer, an alien doomed to wander Earth\u2019s atmosphere, waxed about the woeful nature of man. The Hulk was marked by self-loathing. Daredevil was blind and Iron Man had a weak heart.\n\nSome of Lee\u2019s creations became symbols of social change \u2014 the inner turmoil of Spider-Man represented \u201960s America, for example, while The Black Panther and The Savage She-Hulk mirrored the travails of minorities and women.\n\n\u201cI think of them as fairy tales for grown-ups,\u201d he told The AP. \u201cWe all grew up with giants and ogres and witches. Well, you get a little bit older and you\u2019re too old to read fairy tales. But I don\u2019t think you ever outgrow your love for those kind of things, things that are bigger than life and magical and very imaginative.\u201d\n\nLee scripted most of Marvel\u2019s superhero comics himself during the \u201960s, including ones about the Avengers and the X-Men, two of the most enduring. In 1972, he became Marvel\u2019s publisher and editorial director; four years later, 72 million copies of \u201cSpider-Man\u201d were sold.\n\nCBS turned the Hulk into a successful TV series, with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno portraying the doomed scientist from 1978-82. A Spider-Man series ran briefly in 1978. Both characters were featured in animated TV series as well.\n\nThe first big-budget movie based on Lee\u2019s characters, \u201cX-Men,\u201d was a smash in 2000, earning more than $130 million at North American theaters. \u201cSpider-Man\u201d did even better, taking in more than $400 million in 2002. A Marvel movie empire would emerge after that, one of the most lucrative mega-franchises in cinema history, with the recent \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d grossing more than $2 billion worldwide. In 10 years, the Marvel Cinematic Universe film shave netted over $17.6 billion in worldwide grosses.\n\nLee\u2019s direct influence faded in the 1970s as he gave up some of his editorial duties at Marvel. But with his trademark white mustache and tinted sunglasses, he was the industry\u2019s most recognizable figure. He lectured widely on popular culture.\n\nAs sales of comics declined, Marvel was forced into bankruptcy proceedings that meant it had to void a lifetime contract prohibiting Lee from working for anyone else. Lee later sued Marvel for $10 million, saying the company cheated him out of millions in profits from movies based on his characters.\n\nIn 2000, Lee agreed to write stories for DC Comics, reinventing Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and other signature characters for Marvel\u2019s one-time rival. In the late 1990s, he looked to capitalize on the Internet craze, offering animated \u201cwebisodes\u201d of comic-like action.\n\nLee\u2019s wife and partner in nearly everything, Joan Lee, died in 2017, leaving a void that made her husband, by then in mental and physical decline, vulnerable to hangers-on who began to surround him. Lawsuits, court fights and an elder abuse investigation all emerged in the fight over who spoke for the elderly Lee.\n\nLee is survived by his daughter, Joanie, and a younger brother who also worked in comics, Larry Lieber.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer John Rogers contributed to this story", "Texas' Sam Ehlinger (11) looks to pass the ball during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Texas Tech, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Lubbock, Texas.

Against Oklahoma, the Sooners trailed by 21 before tying the game with 2:38 left. Texas then marched 52 yards in nine plays to Cameron Dicker\u2019s winning field goal. That win still looms big because it could give Texas the tie-breaker edge over the Sooners for a spot in the Big 12 championship game.\n\n\u201cI really would like to not have to be in those situations where we (lose) a 17-point lead in the fourth quarter, but I do love those situations,\u201d Ehlinger said. \u201cI do love having the game on the line and the ball being in our hands because we just have so much confidence in ourselves.\u201d\n\nThat hasn\u2019t been the case at Texas in years. At 7-3, the Longhorns have their most regular-season wins since 2013. They are fighting for a conference championship for the first time since 2013.\n\nEhlinger is just a sophomore and didn\u2019t play through a lot of that losing. Herman noted Monday that a lot of his players did.\n\n\u201cThose guys have seen a lot, been through a lot, sacrificed a lot,\u201d Herman said of his seniors. \u201cThese guys realize, more than the young guys, how different this team is than teams in the past... They know the potential of this team and they are hell-bent on making it happen.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Jim Vertuno at https://twitter.com/jimvertuno", "Light snow causes several accidents, 2 deaths in Kansas City\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo.

(AP) \u2014 Carrying a three-game losing streak and a losing record, the Baltimore Ravens now face the burden of uncertainty at the quarterback position.\n\nJoe Flacco is nursing a hip injury that could keep him out of Sunday\u2019s game against Cincinnati, an AFC North matchup that carries huge ramifications for the sagging Ravens.\n\nWith Baltimore coming off a bye, Flacco received an additional week of rest and treatment after sustaining the injury on Nov. 4 in the opening minutes of a 23-16 loss to Pittsburgh.\n\nFlacco went the distance, completed 23 of 37 passes for 206 yards. His status this week, however, is unclear.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s getting treatment, just like all the guys are getting treatment, and we\u2019ll see,\u201d coach John Harbaugh said Monday. \u201cI\u2019d say that we\u2019ll know more as the week goes on and I\u2019m hopeful all our guys play, including Joe.\u201d\n\nIf Flacco can\u2019t play, rookie Lamar Jackson will likely get his first NFL start, although veteran Robert Griffin III is also an option. Griffin gets the nod in NFL experience, but he\u2019s been inactive in every game this season while Jackson has been used periodically because of his ability to run.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up in the air. We\u2019re not worried about it,\u201d Harbaugh insisted. \u201cWe\u2019re blessed with a good quarterback room. It\u2019s a good thing, that\u2019s a positive thing. We\u2019ve got three guys who can play. It\u2019s just like any other position in my mind. You go with the next guy and you roll.\u201d\n\nThe Ravens (4-5) reached their bye week with losses to New Orleans, Carolina and Pittsburgh. The skid ruined a decent start and left the team in recovery mode as it seeks to snap a run of three straight seasons without reaching the playoffs.\n\nThis is the 11th season that Harbaugh and Flacco have been together in Baltimore, and the coach would love to see his quarterback rally the Ravens into the postseason.\n\n\u201cAny direction we decide to go or we\u2019re forced to go, it will be based on the health of Joe. If Joe can play, he\u2019ll play,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cHe\u2019s rehabbing to play. Joe does not have to practice to play. He\u2019s practiced the whole season, he\u2019s practiced for 11 years. But he might practice. We just have to see how it goes.\u201d\n\nThe 33-year-old Flacco has played through many an injury throughout his career. He did so against the Steelers. His teammates feel that if he can walk, he will play.\n\n\u201cJoe is one of the toughest guys I\u2019ve played with, maybe the toughest guy,\u201d guard Marshal Yanda said. \u201cYou never see him limping around, you never see him on the field showing any sign of weakness. He\u2019s just been a rock for us.

The safety of Indonesia\u2019s airlines had been questioned long before the Lion Air accident.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot more trepidation about flying smaller airlines that Americans have never heard of\u201d since the Oct. 29 Lion Air crash, said Blake Fleetwood, president of Cook Travel in New York. \u201cIt is pushing people to the bigger airlines. People are scared.\u201d\n\nBefore plunking down big money to book international flights, nervous flyers can tap into resources that can provide red-flag warnings if there are doubts about a carrier\u2019s safety.\n\n\u2014 The Federal Aviation Administration determines whether countries meet international safety standards set by the United Nations\u2019 aviation agency. Five currently do not \u2014 Thailand, Bangladesh, Ghana, Curacao and Sint Maarten. Airlines from those countries can\u2019t launch new flights to the U.S. Indonesia got off the blacklist in 2016.\n\n\u2014 Europe bans 120 airlines from its skies. Most are smaller carriers from developing countries in Africa and parts of Asia. Lion Air was banned for nearly a decade until 2016; other blackballed Indonesian carriers only got off the list in June.\n\n\u2014 Aviation Safety Network has an accident database that can be searched by airline or country.\n\n\u2014 Websites like AirlineRatings.com rank carriers based on crash records and other data. That site gave Lion Air a rating of one star out of seven in 2016 but six out of seven last year, after U.S. and European regulators upgraded Indonesia\u2019s aviation regulatory regime.\n\nSuch ratings have their critics. Skytrax , a UK company that does research for airlines and surveys travelers on airline quality, says there is no objective way to rank airlines on safety due to uneven reporting of incidents by airlines and regulators around the world.\n\n\u2014 And there are companies such as Argus International that will provide reports on charter airlines. Since they charge a fee, typically $50 to $150, such services are mostly used by corporate travel departments.\n\nFatal airline accidents have been declining for about two decades. By some accounts, 2017 was the safest year yet. The Aviation Safety Network and To70 , an aviation consultant in the Netherlands, said there were no fatal crashes involving commercial passenger airlines last year. The reports excluded cargo planes, military aircraft, and flights on planes certified to carry fewer than 14 people.\n\n\u201cAviation safety has become much better even in places that were notoriously unsafe at one time,\u201d said Alberto Riva, managing editor of The Points Guy , a website for frequent flyers.\n\nWithin a country, Riva said, some airlines have better safety records than others. He said he would not worry about flying on Garuda Indonesia, the national carrier, \u201cbut if I could find a way to circumvent Lion Air, I would do that.\u201d\n\nFleetwood, the travel agent, said, \u201cI would steer clear of any airline that is not certified to fly to the European Union.\u201d\n\nMatt Kepnes, who wrote \u201cHow to Travel the World on $50 a Day,\u201d said he follows the news closely enough to have a sense of which airlines have good safety records. \u201cI don\u2019t do much digging beyond that unless it is an airline I haven\u2019t heard of, especially one that doesn\u2019t fly to the U.S. or (European Union), as they have tight airline regulations. Then I look.\u201d\n\nKepnes said airlines that fly to many countries tend to have a better safety record. He is more cautious about smaller airlines and domestic carriers in countries where he doesn\u2019t trust the safety standards.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t fly a Russian carrier ... they have a history of poor safety and the planes are quite old,\u201d he said. \u201cIndonesia has a spotty safety record, so I don\u2019t like flying their domestic airlines. The same for India.\u201d\n\nJay Johnson, president of Coastline Travel Advisors in Garden Grove, California, said clients frequently ask about personal safety, but are less likely to ask if transportation is risky.\n\n\u201cBecause there is so much attention placed on dangerous countries or regions, travelers tend to ask questions of safety on the ground rather than how they get there,\u201d he said. He said air travel in the U.S. is so safe that when people ask about a specific airline, it\u2019s usually about creature comforts and not safety records.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if travelers assume they will arrive safely, but does the airline have lay-flat beds?\u201d he said.\n\nTravel agents frequently recommend buying travel insurance for overseas itineraries in case you are unable to make the trip. However, if you try to cancel because the airline on which you are scheduled to fly has an accident, insurance is unlikely to reimburse you. Cancellations are covered only if the reason is specifically listed in the policy \u2014 such as terrorism, a weather event, or illness \u2014 said Jenna Hummer of Squaremouth.com , a travel insurance-comparison site.\n\nThe exception is for people who buy a \u201ccancel for any reason\u201d policy. However, such policies generally must be bought when you book the trip or soon after, and they typically cost about 40 percent more than standard trip-cancellation insurance, Hummer said.\n\n___\n\nDavid Koenig can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter", "SALEM, Ore.

Currently, France, Belgium, Portugal and Spain are favorites to be the finalists.\n\nThe upcoming matches will also establish which of the lower-ranked teams qualify for the Nations League playoffs, from which one place at the 2020 European Championship will be awarded.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what\u2019s at stake:\n\nGROUP A1\n\nFrance, the world champion, has won two of its first three group games and will advance to the Final Four with a win over the Netherlands in Rotterdam on Friday. A victory for the Dutch means they can then qualify by beating \u2014 or potentially even drawing with \u2014 Germany in the group closer in Gelsenkirchen on Monday.\n\nFrance has seen four players, including Paul Pogba, withdraw from the squad through injury on Monday.\n\nGermany is last in the group, having collected one point from three games, and is on the brink of relegation to League B featuring Europe\u2019s second-tier nations. Coming after a World Cup where the team failed to get out of the group stage, coach Germany coach Joachim Loew\u2019s decision to stay on in the role is under as much scrutiny as the team\u2019s mettle.\n\nGROUP A2\n\nIceland has already been relegated after losing its first three games, leaving Belgium and Switzerland \u2014 tied on points \u2014 to battle for first place. The Belgians have played a game less, so a home win over Iceland on Thursday will leave them three points clear heading into the group decider in Switzerland on Monday.\n\nBelgium is the world\u2019s top-ranked team and will look for revenge for its semifinal loss to France at the World Cup if it does reach the Final Four.\n\nGROUP A3\n\nThere is an added emphasis on which of Portugal or Italy advances, considering the team that qualifies from this group will host the Final Four in June. Portugal is the favorite after winning its first two games, without needing Cristiano Ronaldo, and needs only a point away to Italy on Saturday to guarantee first place.\n\nIf Italy wins, Portugal can still finish top with a home win on Tuesday over Poland, which has already been relegated after picking up just one point from its first three games.\n\nGROUP A4\n\nSpain looked on course to qualify comfortably from a group also containing England and World Cup runner-up Croatia after beating both teams in its first two games. Losing to England 3-2 in Sevilla last month, in arguably the standout match of the entire group stage so far, has kept things alive.\n\nIf Spain loses to Croatia in Zagreb on Thursday, England can finish first with a win over the Croats at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.\n\nSpain coach Luis Enrique has called up Barcelona left back Jordi Alba for the first time since taking charge of the team after the World Cup.\n\nLEAGUE B\n\nUkraine became the first country to secure promotion to Group A for the second Nations League, in 2020.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Yes, the narrative of Joe Mauer\u2019s career was missing a championship chapter. That plotline stalled for a few years while the star was set back by injuries.\n\nStill, this story of the Minnesota native with the smooth left-handed swing who played for the Twins the entire time sure was made for a movie.\n\nSix weeks after Mauer symbolically donned his catcher\u2019s gear for one last crouch behind the plate in the final inning of the season , Mauer formalized his goodbye to the game at a tear-filled-yet-cheerful news conference to wrap up a 15-year major league career at age 35.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to have the personal accolades, and I really do believe that\u2019s a byproduct of how the team does, and those things just come along with it,\u201d Mauer said. \u201cBut I\u2019d want to be known as a great teammate, a great person, and a guy who gave it everything he had.\u201d\n\nEven the closing credits were memorable.\n\nMauer carefully flipped through a stack of note cards over a 15-minute thank-you on Monday to the people he\u2019s closest to with a stack of tissues in front of him on the podium. He needed them immediately, when the mention of his parents, Jake and Teresa, caused his eyes to water and his voice to waver.\n\n\u201cYou helped keep me grounded and never let me forget my roots,\u201d said Mauer, who began honing his skills at the sandlots and rec centers of St. Paul, less than 10 miles from the big league ballparks in Minneapolis he first began playing in at age 20 to open the 2004 seasons.\n\nThat\u2019s the same city where Hall of Fame members Jack Morris, Paul Molitor and Dave Winfield were raised. Mauer\u2019s final tally of 2,123 hits might ultimately leave him short of the call to Cooperstown, but he was clearly on that track over the first 10 years of his career considering he hit .323 with an .873 on-base-plus-slugging percentage until a concussion in 2013 forced him to move out from behind the plate and become a first baseman. Mauer is the only American League catcher to win a batting title, a feat he accomplished three times: 2006, 2008 and 2009.\n\nThe six-time All-Star finished with a .306 lifetime average\n\n\u201cThe naysayers will talk about maybe not enough career numbers, a little decline at the end ... but there\u2019s going to be a lot of numbers that put him right in the mix with some of the Hall of Famers,\u201d Molitor said. \u201cSo I\u2019m obviously a little bit biased. I\u2019d love to see it happen.\u201d\n\nThe latest concussion in May that kept him out for a month, Mauer said, caused him to seriously consider retiring for the first time. The expiration of his eight-year, $184 million contract in October created a natural parting, but the long-term effect of head injuries and his dedication to family weighed much heavier than an MLB-best .407 batting average this year with runners in scoring position.\n\nThe respect for Mauer was evident with the appearance of former Twins managers Molitor, Ron Gardenhire and Tom Kelly and ex-general managers Terry Ryan and Bill Smith. Molitor was fired last month and replaced by Rocco Baldelli, who also showed up.\n\nSo did Mauer\u2019s former teammates Glen Perkins, Justin Morneau and Corey Koskie. His coach at Cretin-Derham Hall High School, Jim O\u2019Neill, who taught him to never swing at the first pitch, was there. His maternal grandparents, who attended all but about a dozen of his home games with the Twins, a staggering total of approximately 1,200, attended as well.\n\nWith his wife, Maddie, due any day with the couple\u2019s third child, Mauer\u2019s focus for now will be on husband and father rather than fielding and hitting. He said he\u2019ll stay connected to his hometown team in some capacity and will, in case there were any question, raise his kids in Minnesota.\n\nRyan sat in the front row of the packed room in the basement of Target Field as Mauer expressed his gratitude for the decision to draft him in 2001 with the first overall pick instead of Mark Prior or Mark Teixeira.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of great options out there, but I\u2019m so thankful you had the confidence in me, and it means more to me than you\u2019ll ever know,\u201d Mauer said.\n\nMaking so much money and missing so many games soured the cynical portions of the fan base on Mauer, but even if he had stayed healthy like Cal Ripken Jr. and hit home runs like Harmon Killebrew he would have carried immense pressure playing in his home territory.\n\n\u201cI knew what it was like for me, and it was times 100 for him,\u201d said Perkins, another Minnesota native who spent his whole career with the Twins.\n\nIn the end, Mauer\u2019s maturity and poise stuck with his admirers as much as his keen eye and textbook swing.\n\nMorneau, who was Mauer\u2019s closest friend on the Twins during the 10 seasons they played together, recalled hitting a home run during an afternoon game in 2006 while playing with a bit of a hangover from an outing at a St. Paul bar the night before.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Yes, the narrative of Joe Mauer\u2019s career was missing a championship chapter. That plotline stalled for a few years while the star was set back by injuries.\n\nStill, this story of the Minnesota native with the smooth left-handed swing who played for the Twins the entire time sure was made for a movie.\n\nSix weeks after Mauer symbolically donned his catcher\u2019s gear for one last crouch behind the plate in the final inning of the season , Mauer formalized his goodbye to the game at a tear-filled-yet-cheerful news conference to wrap up a 15-year major league career at age 35.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to have the personal accolades, and I really do believe that\u2019s a byproduct of how the team does, and those things just come along with it,\u201d Mauer said. \u201cBut I\u2019d want to be known as a great teammate, a great person, and a guy who gave it everything he had.\u201d\n\nEven the closing credits were memorable.\n\nMauer carefully flipped through a stack of note cards over a 15-minute thank-you on Monday to the people he\u2019s closest to with a stack of tissues in front of him on the podium. He needed them immediately, when the mention of his parents, Jake and Teresa, caused his eyes to water and his voice to waver.\n\n\u201cYou helped keep me grounded and never let me forget my roots,\u201d said Mauer, who began honing his skills at the sandlots and rec centers of St. Paul, less than 10 miles from the big league ballparks in Minneapolis he first began playing in at age 20 to open the 2004 seasons.\n\nThat\u2019s the same city where Hall of Fame members Jack Morris, Paul Molitor and Dave Winfield were raised. Mauer\u2019s final tally of 2,123 hits might ultimately leave him short of the call to Cooperstown, but he was clearly on that track over the first 10 years of his career considering he hit .323 with an .873 on-base-plus-slugging percentage until a concussion in 2013 forced him to move out from behind the plate and become a first baseman. Mauer is the only American League catcher to win a batting title, a feat he accomplished three times: 2006, 2008 and 2009.\n\nThe six-time All-Star finished with a .306 lifetime average\n\n\u201cThe naysayers will talk about maybe not enough career numbers, a little decline at the end ... but there\u2019s going to be a lot of numbers that put him right in the mix with some of the Hall of Famers,\u201d Molitor said. \u201cSo I\u2019m obviously a little bit biased. I\u2019d love to see it happen.\u201d\n\nThe latest concussion in May that kept him out for a month, Mauer said, caused him to seriously consider retiring for the first time. The expiration of his eight-year, $184 million contract in October created a natural parting, but the long-term effect of head injuries and his dedication to family weighed much heavier than an MLB-best .407 batting average this year with runners in scoring position.\n\nThe respect for Mauer was evident with the appearance of former Twins managers Molitor, Ron Gardenhire and Tom Kelly and ex-general managers Terry Ryan and Bill Smith. Molitor was fired last month and replaced by Rocco Baldelli, who also showed up.\n\nSo did Mauer\u2019s former teammates Glen Perkins, Justin Morneau and Corey Koskie. His coach at Cretin-Derham Hall High School, Jim O\u2019Neill, who taught him to never swing at the first pitch, was there. His maternal grandparents, who attended all but about a dozen of his home games with the Twins, a staggering total of approximately 1,200, attended as well.\n\nWith his wife, Maddie, due any day with the couple\u2019s third child, Mauer\u2019s focus for now will be on husband and father rather than fielding and hitting. He said he\u2019ll stay connected to his hometown team in some capacity and will, in case there were any question, raise his kids in Minnesota.\n\nRyan sat in the front row of the packed room in the basement of Target Field as Mauer expressed his gratitude for the decision to draft him in 2001 with the first overall pick instead of Mark Prior or Mark Teixeira.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of great options out there, but I\u2019m so thankful you had the confidence in me, and it means more to me than you\u2019ll ever know,\u201d Mauer said.\n\nMaking so much money and missing so many games soured the cynical portions of the fan base on Mauer, but even if he had stayed healthy like Cal Ripken Jr. and hit home runs like Harmon Killebrew he would have carried immense pressure playing in his home territory.\n\n\u201cI knew what it was like for me, and it was times 100 for him,\u201d said Perkins, another Minnesota native who spent his whole career with the Twins.\n\nIn the end, Mauer\u2019s maturity and poise stuck with his admirers as much as his keen eye and textbook swing.\n\nMorneau, who was Mauer\u2019s closest friend on the Twins during the 10 seasons they played together, recalled hitting a home run during an afternoon game in 2006 while playing with a bit of a hangover from an outing at a St. Paul bar the night before. Mauer wasn\u2019t so impressed.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018How can you argue with that?\u2019\u201d Morneau said, smiling. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018How do you know if you weren\u2019t hung over you wouldn\u2019t have hit two homers?\u2019 And I said, \u2018You know what? He\u2019s got a point.\u2019\u201d\n\nMorneau went on to the AL MVP award that year.

(AP Photo/Ivan Moreno File)\n\nAn Illinois man whose 1994 murder conviction was based on shoddy ballistic evidence wants his case dismissed on the eve of his retrial after allegations of police and prosecutorial misconduct surfaced.\n\nLawyers for Patrick Pursley, 52, will argue their request for dismissal Tuesday, the day the trial had been scheduled to begin in Winnebago County Court. Pursley\u2019s motion cites \u201cdue process violations, including failure to disclose significant exculpatory evidence.\u201d\n\nPursley won a new trial last year after additional ballistic testing proved the gun used to convict him in 1994 for 22-year-old Andy Ascher\u2019s death wasn\u2019t the homicide weapon. The case took a twist last week when James Brun, the assistant state attorney handling the case, disclosed during a pretrial hearing that the victim\u2019s mother told his predecessor a year ago that she believed police planted the firearm.\n\nThat information had never been disclosed to Pursley\u2019s attorneys until last week.\n\n\u201cI can confirm it relates to allegations of police and prosecutorial misconduct,\u201d said Andrew Vail, one of Pursley\u2019s attorneys, when asked if the motion was related to Brun\u2019s court revelation. He said he could not comment further or offer details of their motion until it\u2019s heard in court.\n\nKatie Zimmerman, a spokeswoman for the Winnebago state\u2019s attorney, confirmed Pursley\u2019s motion had been filed, but said her office \u201ccan\u2019t comment on this or any other pending cases at this time.\u201d\n\nA judge granted Pursley a new trial in April 2017. It happened only after Pursley lobbied lawmakers from prison to change state law to allow him to use the Integrated Ballistic Identification System to retest the shell casings used to prosecute him. IBIS, which became available five years after his conviction, compares high-resolution, multi-dimensional images of shell casings to find markings unique to a specific weapon. In Pursley\u2019s case, it failed to match the gun police took from him to the bullets that killed Ascher.\n\nPursley\u2019s case is the first to make it this far using the Illinois law, and the outcome could help pave a new path to challenge convictions that relied on a flawed process for analyzing ballistic evidence \u2014 a practice that has drawn more scientific scrutiny over the past two decades.\n\nWinnebago County prosecutors maintained it was Pursley who fatally shot Ascher in Rockford, Illinois, during a robbery as he sat in a car with his girlfriend on April 2, 1993.\n\nTo convict Pursley, prosecutors relied on the shell casings recovered from the scene, which one of their experts testified could only have come from a gun police recovered from Pursley. That was the only physical evidence prosecutors had connecting Pursley to the crime.\n\nPursley represented himself for years during his appeals before Northwestern University\u2019s Center on Wrongful Convictions, and the law firm Jenner and Block, took on his case for free.\n\n\u201cI had no idea that this day would come,\u201d Pursley said in an interview last week. \u201cI just knew what I had to do to get to this day.\u201d\n\nPursley has been free on bail since April 2017 and has had speaking engagements at higher education institutions in Illinois, talking about wrongful convictions and addressing gang violence. He\u2019s launched a nonprofit, called \u201cI Am Kid Culture,\u201d dedicated to encouraging youths to go to college and avoid a life of crime. And he\u2019s built a recording studio in the basement of his Rockford home to develop a talent agency for urban youth interested in music.\n\nWhen Pursley was a teenager, his mother gave custody of him to the state and he spent time in foster homes and group homes, eventually ending up in Rockford. There, he joined a gang and was frequently in trouble with police. That\u2019s why the projects he\u2019s now working on are so important to him, he said.\n\n\u201cI know that gang activity played a large role in my demise as a teenager and into my 20s,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want to be able to help turn that cycle around for others who might be living in these circumstances.\u201d\n\n___\n\nIvan Moreno is on Twitter: http://twitter.com/1TrueIvan", "BILLINGS, Mont.

Tennessee won 24-7. (AP Photo/Wade Payne)\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 On a couple of occasions this season, Tennessee outside linebacker Darrell Taylor has resembled one of the most dominant pass rushers in the nation.\n\nThe rest of the year, he hasn\u2019t been much of a factor.\n\nThe best version of Taylor showed up last week when he sacked Terry Wilson four times in a 24-7 upset of No. 20 Kentucky, which was ranked 12th at the time. Tennessee now wants to see if Taylor can continue pressuring opposing quarterbacks the rest of the season.\n\n\u201cYou just look up and there he goes again,\u201d Tennessee defensive end Kyle Phillips said. \u201cIt made our job a lot easier, let me tell you that. It made (it) a lot easier. We\u2019re going to definitely need some more of that from Darrell Taylor moving forward. It was an amazing performance.\u201d\n\nTaylor\u2019s four sacks matched College Football and Pro Football Hall of Famer Reggie White for the second-highest single-game total in school history. The single-game record is held by Corey Miller, who produced 4 \u00bd sacks in a 2013 victory over Kentucky.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d Taylor said of being mentioned alongside White. \u201cI never thought it would happen. It feels really good, man, and I got to enjoy it with my teammates and family.\u201d\n\nThis marks a breakthrough season for Taylor, thanks almost entirely to his performances on a couple of weekends.\n\nTaylor has a team-high seven sacks, but they all came in two games. He had three sacks in a 38-12 loss to No. 5 Georgia on Sept. 29 before his four-sack effort last week. All three of his forced fumbles this season also came in those two games. He had a fumble recovery and five tackles but no sacks in a 30-24 victory over Auburn last month.\n\nNobody else on Tennessee\u2019s roster has recorded more than three sacks this season. Taylor, a junior from Waverly, Virginia, entered this season with three career sacks.\n\n\u201cDarrell has ability,\u201d Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been harping on him all year about consistency. He\u2019s learning a new scheme and he\u2019s got a lot thrown at him just like the other guys, and he\u2019s going to continue to improve in the duration of his career.\u201d\n\nTaylor believes he knows what it takes to start producing more consistently.\n\n\u201cJust focus on the little things, studying film, practicing the way I\u2019m supposed to practice - little things like that,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nTaylor\u2019s performances against Georgia and Kentucky showcased his considerable potential. Taylor\u2019s coaches want to see him play that way more often.\n\nThat may explain why Pruitt wasn\u2019t overly generous in his praise of Taylor\u2019s four-sack effort.\n\n\u201cWell, twice they didn\u2019t block him,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cWhen they don\u2019t block you, you need to sack the quarterback. The other two times, we had them in long-yardage situations and I think that helped. It helped with them being behind the sticks. I think some of it had to do with not having explosive plays and having a little more ability to stop the run, to put them in some long-yardage situations. It\u2019s much easier to rush the quarterback when they\u2019re one-dimensional.\u201d\n\nIndeed, at least on Taylor\u2019s final sack of the day, he never got touched on his way to the quarterback.\n\n\u201cMy eyes got big,\u201d Taylor said of that play. \u201cMy eyes got really big, man.\u201d\n\nTaylor\u2019s pass-rushing ability could prove critical the next two weeks as Tennessee tries to secure a bowl bid.\n\nThe Vols (5-5, 2-4 SEC) must win one of their two remaining games to become bowl eligible. They host Missouri (6-4, 2-4) on Saturday before visiting Vanderbilt (4-6, 1-5) on Nov. 24.\n\nMissouri has attempted the second-most passes (356) in the SEC this year, yet it has allowed the second-fewest sacks (12) in the conference.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to get back in the lab, the football film room and get back on the field, and we\u2019re going to see what happens,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nNOTES: Pruitt is optimistic that safety Trevon Flowers will be able to play against Missouri. Flowers has missed Tennessee\u2019s last five games due to a broken collarbone. ... Cornerback Bryce Thompson\u2019s status for the Missouri game is uncertain.

Two went for touchdowns. Of his 131 yards, 62 came after the catch, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\n\u201cI have all the faith in the world in him,\u201d quarterback Adrian Martinez said. \u201cEvery time I throw him the ball, I think he\u2019s going to catch it.\u201d\n\nMorgan has blossomed since the start of his junior year. The New Orleans native was prone to dropping passes his first two seasons, and in the spring of 2017 he was charged with marijuana possession in Florida. Prosecutors dropped the misdemeanor charge after he completed a treatment program.\n\nWith three of the Huskers\u2019 top four receivers gone from 2016, he nearly doubled his production and caught 61 passes for 986 yards and 10 touchdowns. He led the Big Ten with 89.6 yards per game and probably would have gone over 1,000 for the season if he hadn\u2019t missed a game because of a neck injury.\n\nMorgan decided to take his chances with a new coaching staff and return for his senior season. He was named a team captain, a tribute to how far he\u2019s come.\n\n\u201cStan is someone who comes to work every day with a smile,\u201d fellow captain and offensive lineman Jerald Foster said. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who\u2019s energized and wants us to do our best, not only himself. On the sideline, he\u2019s the one pumping everyone up, from the defensive side all the way to the offensive. I\u2019m really excited to see these last two games.

(AP Photo/John Raoux, File)\n\nATHENS, Ga. (AP) \u2014 There\u2019s never been a better time for Kirby Smart to tell his Georgia players the focus is on them, not the opponent.\n\nIt\u2019s a much-repeated mantra for the Georgia coach that should hit home with players as they begin preparation for Saturday\u2019s visit from UMass.\n\nAfter completing a stretch of seven straight Southeastern Conference games, including last week\u2019s 27-10 win over Auburn , No. 5 Georgia (9-1, No. 5 CFP) will close its regular season with nonconference games against UMass and Georgia Tech.\n\nPlayers might be tempted to look ahead to the Dec. 1 SEC championship game against No. 1 Alabama even before the state rivalry game against Georgia Tech.\n\nIt could be even more difficult to remain locked in on the Bulldogs\u2019 first game against the Minutemen. The opening betting line listed Georgia favored by 45 points for its first meeting with UMass.\n\nSmart recognizes focus could be a challenge this week.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s leadership,\u201d Smart said Monday. \u201cI think we\u2019ll find out a lot about our team this week because it\u2019s never about who we\u2019re playing. ... I\u2019ve told you all every week that it\u2019s not about Florida, it\u2019s not about Kentucky. It\u2019s not really about them. It\u2019s just about how we work, because we worry about us. And that way when you get to this week, it\u2019s not different. And we focus on us.\u201d\n\nUMass (4-7) is coming off a 35-16 home loss to Brigham Young . The Minutemen lost at Boston College 55-21 on Sept. 1 in their only game this season against a Power Five team.\n\nIt is clear Smart\u2019s players have practiced their answers about not looking ahead.\n\n\u201cThe next one is the biggest one,\u201d said wide receiver Tyler Simmons.\n\nBigger than Alabama?\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the biggest one, but it\u2019s the biggest one right now,\u201d Simmons said with a smile.\n\n\u201cWe take every game like any other one. Like Auburn, like Alabama, we\u2019re going to take UMass the same way.\u201d\n\nGeorgia has won three straight games, including against No. 15 Florida and No. 20 Kentucky, since its only loss at No. 10 LSU on Oct. 13.\n\nThe Bulldogs\u2019 biggest motivator the next two weeks is to protect their national championship hopes. Quarterback Jake Fromm doesn\u2019t want to see the Bulldogs stumble against UMass.\n\n\u201cThe team has definitely taken strides right now,\u201d Fromm said. \u201cYou can tell with the caliber of opponents we\u2019ve been playing and how well we\u2019ve been able to run the ball and play as a team. The defense has been playing real well now stopping the run and getting off on third down. Let\u2019s just keep going, keep chopping away at it and hopefully it can pay off for us.\u201d\n\nThis could be a week where Smart gives more playing time to backup players, though he said, \u201cI think that\u2019s a large assumption.\u201d\n\nApparently that assumption has made its way through the roster.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard the buzz a little bit about young guys being excited to play,\u201d Simmons said. \u201d... I know they look forward to it a lot. ... It\u2019s just good to have a chance to see them play.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Georgia could have a patchwork offensive line for the game. Smart said RG Kendall Baker, who left the win over Auburn with an apparent left knee injury, and OT Cade Mays are day to day with injuries. C Lamont Gaillard, who left the game in the fourth quarter, and LG Ben Cleveland also have battled injuries. ... LB Brenton Cox may return this week after missing the game with an ankle injury. ...

Fogelman says how Jack\u2019s younger brother, Nicky, died in the Vietnam War will be revealed by season\u2019s end. (Ron Batzdorff/NBC via AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cThis Is Us\u201d star Milo Ventimiglia was between scenes on the set in Vietnam, the setting for a critical flashback story about his character Jack\u2019s wartime tragedy.\n\nThen modern-day reality merged with TV fiction about a decades-old conflict.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m there in full battle dress, my rifle slung, my hat on, looking very much the 1970 U.S. soldier, and an older gentleman going past us said something in Vietnamese, did a double-take on me and then just kept going,\u201d Ventimiglia said of last month\u2019s encounter outside Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThe Vietnamese actors he was working with suddenly burst out laughing, then filled him in.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell? What the hell is a U.S. soldier doing back here?\u201d the man exclaimed as he zipped by on a motor scooter, Ventimiglia was told.\n\nIt was an isolated blip in an otherwise smooth week of shooting in Vietnam, with the scenes to be scattered throughout \u201cThis Is Us\u201d episodes as the series gradually unravels \u2014 in its trademark style \u2014 a key chapter of Jack\u2019s life.\n\nThe NBC drama, which toggles back and forth in time between moments big and small for its characters, is zeroing in on what Jack endured during the failed U.S. war to defeat communist North Vietnam: The death of his brother, Nicky, played by Michael Angarano.\n\nThat\u2019s no spoiler, as \u201cThis Is Us\u201d viewers know. But unlike the prolonged, angst-building revelation of how family man Jack died, series creator Dan Fogelman said the circumstances of Nicky\u2019s fate will be known by this season\u2019s end.\n\nHe is well aware of the audience\u2019s investment in Nicky, he said, with his own anxious friends and family serving as a barometer. Fogelman credits the actors playing Nicky as a child and adult (Donnie Masihi, Angarano) and the bond between Jack and the younger brother he is driven to protect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely something that\u2019s a big part of our season and that we\u2019ll get all the answers for by the end of the season,\u201d he said. Does that include learning the identity of the woman shown alongside Jack in an intriguing wartime photo?\n\n\u201cYes, exactly,\u201d Fogelman said, a reply at once comforting and opaque. He\u2019d already made the point that providing answers on \u201cThis Is Us\u201d often means raising more questions.\n\nThere will pain along the way, said Ventimiglia, who plays the patriarch of the Pearson family that includes wife Rebecca (Mandy Moore) and offspring Randall (Sterling K. Brown), Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Kevin (Justin Hartley). Even he was more deeply affected than usual by what Jack is facing, the actor said.\n\n\u201cWhen I watch the show, I\u2019ve cried for Rebecca, I\u2019ve cried for the kids. I never cry for Jack,\u201d Ventimiglia said, but that changed after he previewed the episode airing Tuesday. \u201cIt was really heartbreaking to see him go through what he went through.\u201d\n\nAs with all \u201cThis Is Us\u201d joys or misfortunes, there\u2019s a ripple effect for generations ahead. This week\u2019s episode has Kevin and girlfriend Zoe (Melanie Liburd) arriving in Vietnam, with flashbacks uncovering more of Jack\u2019s ordeal there. (There\u2019s also a Jack-Rebecca road trip to Los Angeles, circa the couple\u2019s early days together.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re showing the audience Jack\u2019s experiences in Vietnam and we\u2019re also showing the impact that it\u2019s had even beyond that,\u201d Ventimiglia said. \u201cHis son Kevin is digging in deeper, trying to understand what his father went through to connect to him,\u201d with other siblings involved as well.\n\nThe Vietnam story line, which earned a rare hour of its own last month, is woven in the narrative as the season progresses. But Fogelman said its importance, and the lack of a military veteran on the show\u2019s writing staff, warranted bringing in Vietnam veteran and acclaimed writer Tim O\u2019Brien (\u201cThe Things They Carried\u201d) as a consultant.\n\nO\u2019Brien said he\u2019s been impressed by the show\u2019s painstaking approach and its artistry.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just totally committed to making getting everything right,\u201d he said, in contrast to many other Vietnam dramas. \u201cBut even more important to me was the quality of the show. ...

(AP Photo/Mike Roemer)\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) \u2014 It can be difficult enough for NFL players to have just three days to prepare for a Thursday night game.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers have another unique wrinkle in their schedule: they must fly west this year for their Thursday night matchup against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nIt didn\u2019t leave much time for the Packers to wind down on Monday, a day after the 31-12 win over the Miami Dolphins.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to take care of your body, make sure you\u2019re doing the right things these next couple days to get ready,\u201d defensive lineman Kenny Clark said. \u201cMentally, you just put your head in the film, get a chance to look at them early.\u201d\n\nThe abbreviated practice plans have the Packers (4-4-1) flying to Seattle on Tuesday night following what would be the most extensive practice of the week. Coaches did some preliminary preparation last week for the Seahawks, though the primary focus was on beating the Dolphins.\n\nThat goal was accomplished, even as more injuries took a toll on the defense.\n\nSafety Kentrell Brice (left ankle), linebacker Nick Perry (knee) and Bashaud Breeland (groin) left the Dolphins game. They\u2019re all starters, and another starter, cornerback Kevin King, missed the game with a hamstring injury.\n\nThe defense bent but did not break, holding Miami to four field goals in spite of being put in some tricky situations. Two turnovers on special teams gave the Dolphins the ball at midfield or better. A failed fourth-and-2 for the offense had Miami starting at the Packers 45.\n\nThe Dolphins managed just field goals each time, while the Packers kept scoring touchdowns.\n\n\u201cWe really played everybody that was up in our secondary, and everybody was ready when their number was called, and they really made plays for us,\u201d Breeland said after the game. He picked off Brock Osweiler deep in Miami territory and returned the ball to the 12 to set up a touchdown late in the third quarter.\n\nBreeland\u2019s injury appeared to be relatively minor, and he hoped to be ready for Thursday.\n\nA positive for the Packers\u2019 defense is that backups played fairly well to fill voids, including reserve safety Raven Greene. He had a sack and also took a direct snap on a fake punt for a 26-yard run.\n\nIt\u2019s a confidence-building win especially for a secondary that has had instability over the past few weeks, starting with the trade of starting safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix to Washington. Another safety, Jermaine Whitehead, was released last week. Veteran cornerback Tramon Williams has started at safety alongside Brice the past couple of games.\n\n\u201cIt took everybody today, man. It was a good, team win,\u201d Williams said Sunday.\n\nGreen Bay eventually took advantage of backup Brock Osweiler, who was starting for a fifth straight game in place of the injured Ryan Tannehill. They got to Osweiler for six sacks. The Dolphins were just as banged up at receiver, too, losing Davante Parker and Jakeem Grant during the game.\n\nBut Miami gets a bye this week to rest up. The Packers figure to take it easier in practice on Tuesday, which would probably have been the case regardless of all the injuries in their secondary.\n\nThat puts a premium, then on the mental part of the game and preparation.\n\n\u201cFull speed ahead. Some guys might try to click through the film last night,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cA number of coaches just went right upstairs after the game ... but as far as the team, we don\u2019t have any time to spend on, we have to get right into Seattle.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "DOVER, Del.

Don\u2019t get into teaching if you don\u2019t love students.\u201d\n\nThe sixth of 10 children, Davis was raised on a farm in Wardsboro, Vermont, and was taught in a one-room schoolhouse where she didn\u2019t learn to read until she was in fifth grade.\n\n\u201cI knew how to milk a cow before my legs were long enough to hold the pail,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThere were 16 or 17 kids in our school and a third were my brothers and sisters.\u201d\n\nAnd she wasn\u2019t the only one who benefited from her elementary lessons.\n\n\u201cMy father didn\u2019t have the benefit of an education,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe taught him to read and write.\u201d\n\nDavis said her family \u2014 her mother especially \u2014 attended Mass when they could, whether it took a car, a wagon or a sleigh to get them to St. Michael\u2019s in Brattleboro.\n\nAt 10, Davis and her family moved onto Cedar Street in Brattleboro so she and her siblings could go to school while her parents worked at the cotton mill nearby.\n\nIt was in school at St. Michael\u2019s that Davis said she developed a special connection with the Sisters of St. Joseph and was inspired to take up the habit and vows herself.\n\n\u201cI had this revelation that God was calling me to do something more,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI thought I was going to become a (certified public accountant), but God stepped in, and I became a math teacher.\u201d\n\nFresh out of high school in 1955, Davis came to the Convent at St. Joseph\u2019s to adopt a new way of life as a nun under the tutelage of Irish immigrant Sister St. Michael.\n\n\u201cAll three schools were founded by the sisters of St. Joseph,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThat\u2019s my community. This was the first place they sort of rooted: It feels like Convent Avenue is home.\u201d\n\nAfter six months at the convent, Davis received her habit, and after three years took the vows of poverty, chastity, obedience and process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenging way of life: You buy only what you need and with permission. You learn your religion even more, then you practice it as part of a community. You get to witness to living in that community is possible,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was in 1962 that she began teaching at Christ the King School, where she was a math teacher for five years before coming to MSJ, where she was principal from 1983 to 1998.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been at MSJ 37 years,\u201d Davis said. \u201d ... When I took the role of principal here, it was supposed to be an interim role. That turned into 15 years. The last year here, they called me president.\u201d\n\nBut a new calling drew Davis from her beloved Convent Avenue school, and she was offered a job as assistant superintendent for Burlington schools in 1998, where she remained for just over a decade.\n\n\u201cI got to travel all over the state, and got to really get to know the Northeast Kingdom in particular,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely beautiful.\u201d\n\nAs time went on though, Sister Shirley felt it was time to cut down on her hours, and was drawn back again to her community in Rutland, where she served as a foster grandparent and tutor at Vermont Achievement Center for eight years.\n\n\u201cI absolutely loved that,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI wanted to fill whatever the need was, and they are a group that gives children a special someone.\u201d\n\nBut earlier this year, Davis felt drawn once again to MSJ, to be a math tutor and foster grandparent to the 100 students at the place she found her spirit and her first studies.\n\n\u201cI looked forward to this all summer after Sarah Fortier said \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d Davis said. \u201cI\u2019m here 5\u00bd hours, four days a week. I take Fridays off, and the kids used to give me a hard time about it.\u201d\n\nAfter so long in the Rutland community, Davis said the school still feels like home, and seeing all of her former students growing up and becoming prominent members of the community brings her a sense of fulfillment.\n\n\u201cMSJ graduates running for office, it feels like what you tried to do with them, you succeeded,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt feels like more than just a paycheck.\u201d\n\nDavis said she remembers fondly the days when she taught state Rep. Lawrence Cupoli, almost every member of the Cioffi family, longtime Herald photographer Albert \u201cA.J.\u201d Marro and Mayor David Allaire.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about being with people, and helping people if I can,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI\u2019m still willing to challenge people. We all need someone in our lives who can hold up \u2018you can be more.\u2019\u201d\n\nThough she stopped wearing her habit in the \u201970s as part of the Second Vatican\u2019s message to \u201csimplify,\u201d Sister Shirley said she still holds close the dedication to her faith and the family she\u2019s found in Rutland, whether they be the sisters of her order or the students she helps raise into dedicated and passionate people.\n\n\u201cOne of the gifts we can give people is to let them be who they are.

Rick Ward, a Republican from Port Allen, near Baton Rouge, is featured in a new one-minute television ad calling for a new span.\n\nThe Advocate reports that the ad is paid for through Ward\u2019s campaign fund. It\u2019s getting praise from leaders of parishes that have been directly affected by the recent closure of the Sunshine Bridge. Leaders say that bridge\u2019s closure following an October barge accident has made existing traffic problems worse.\n\nThe Sunshine bridge, in St. James Parish, is part of the transportation system serving industrialized areas downriver from Baton Rouge. The estimated cost of a new bridge is $1 billion.\n\n\u201cSince everything that has happened with the Sunshine bridge, everyone\u2019s radar is up more than ever before,\u201d Ward said.\n\nThe ad is a precursor to the work that will be done by the Capital Region Infrastructure Authority, which was created this spring through legislation Ward sponsored. The authority is composed of appointees from East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, Iberville, Livingston and Ascension parishes, and the secretary of the state\u2019s Department of Transportation and Development.\n\nEast Baton Rouge Parish Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome attended the authority\u2019s first meeting a few months ago and says she plans to be an active participant in the conversation about a new bridge, a project she says would fall in line with her \u201cMoveBR\u201d 30-year, half-cent sales tax proposal.\n\nBroome intends to use revenue generated by the sales tax, up for voter consideration on Dec. 8, to pay for upgrades and improvements to roadways throughout the city-parish.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no denying a new bridge will be beneficial,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to devising how and where a new bridge could be built, Ward\u2019s bill also gives the authority the power to propose fees and/or taxes that would fund whatever traffic solutions the body proposes.\n\nJust a new bridge alone has an estimated price tag of at least $1 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s where the ad comes in.\n\nAny funding measures would have to win voter approval. A few preliminary ideas include a public-private partnership that would allow the authority to build the bridge and pay for it through tolls at the structure or sales taxes across the five-parish region.\n\n\u201cThe PAC was set up for two reasons,\u201d Ward said. \u201cTo let people know if they vote on something, it\u2019s not another study to determine how to build a bridge.

Klee said that has had a huge impact on markets globally as well as in the U.S., forcing down prices for recycled paper, plastic and other materials.\n\nOne of the ironies of the current problem is that state and local officials are pushing hard to increase the amount of recycling in Connecticut. But many people try to recycle all kinds of things that simply can\u2019t be recycled with current technology.\n\nPlastic bags, coffee cups and covers, plastic straws, dog and cat food bags and a host of other non-recyclable materials are being dumped in single-source recycling bins.

Hladky/Hartford Courant)\n\nThose decisions, which Chinese officials attributed to environmental concerns, has resulted in massive cutbacks from the more than $5.6 billion worth of recycled goods that China used to import from the U.S.\n\nNations that include India, Malaysia and Vietnam have to a degree stepped up their imports of U.S. recycled materials, but experts say that can\u2019t compensate for the huge loss of China\u2019s recycling market.\n\n\u201cAlmost three-fourths of recycling in the U.S. goes out of the country,\u201d Petrone said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of our biggest exports.\u201d\n\nKlee said that, although much of Connecticut\u2019s recycled materials goes to domestic U.S. processors and mills, the halt in Chinese imports has created a massive recycling backup that \u201chas flooded the market and depressed prices.\u201d\n\nIn some parts of the U.S., according to a New York Times report, recyclers unable to find markets for their low-grade paper and plastic are piling it up in warehouses or sending it to incinerators to be burned.\n\nGaffey said a Massachusetts recycling operation recently received permission from authorities in that state to burn thousands of tons of stockpiled paper.\n\nAt the MIRA recycling facility in South Hartford, materials that are unable to be disposed of in ordinary ways can be sent to the agency\u2019s garbage-to-energy plant as fuel to generate electricity.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s trade wars with China and other potential recycling-import nations is also now \u201churting aluminum prices\u201d for recycled cans, Gaffey said.\n\nDeVivo, who runs his family\u2019s 80-year-old trash and recycling operation with his brother Tim, said new tariffs on steel are beginning to raise prices for critical machinery. \u201cWhen you go to buy new machines - Holy Moly - the price of steel has gotten real high,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to DeVivo, his company has slowed hiring and made other cutbacks to trying and cope with lower recycling sale prices and higher costs.\n\nWillimantic Waste Paper serves about 30 percent of cities and towns in this state, mostly across eastern Connecticut, and now takes in about 300 tons of recyclables a week.\n\nAsked how long his family\u2019s company can survive before recycling prices revive, DeVivo shrugs. \u201cOnly God knows. You can do it \u2019til you can\u2019t do it anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nDeVivo said his company is now absorbing the pain of lower sales prices for some materials and higher expenses when it comes to long-term contracts with municipal customers. But other customers with no long-term agreements are now being charged higher prices for recycling.\n\nNot all recycled materials are facing price drops, according to various Connecticut experts. High-grade plastics like milk jugs, water bottles and soda containers continue to be saleable.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be the norm for some time,\u201d Gaffey said.\n\nMIRA, which stands for Materials Innovation and Recycling Authority and is the successor to the Connecticut Resource Recycling Authority, doesn\u2019t charge its member communities separately for recycling services. Those costs are currently included as part of the $74 per ton fee communities pay MIRA for solid waste disposal.\n\nBut Gaffey warns that his agency will, in about a year, begin negotiations with the company that operates MIRA\u2019s recycling facility, or a replacement operator. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult to get the same terms we have in this contract,\u201d he said. Any significant increases in recycling costs are likely to be passed on to member communities.\n\nAccording to Gaffey, some Connecticut communities that aren\u2019t part of the MIRA system are now paying $50-$100 a ton to have their recycling handled by commercial facilities.\n\nAnother troubling issue for all the recycling officials interviewed is the problems caused by what they call \u201cwishful recyclers,\u201d consumers that throw all kinds of stuff in recycling bins with the hope that it can be recycled.\n\n\u201cThey want to recycle everything,\u201d said DeVivo, \u201cand you can\u2019t recycle everything.\u201d\n\nOne Billion Plastic Bags Are Used In Connecticut Each Year. Towns Across The State Are Hoping To Change That\n\nSingle-use plastic bags are one of the biggest issues for recycling operations. The bags, which many communities across the state are now considering banning for charging fees for, tangle and jam equipment designed to sort out paper, glass cardboard and aluminum.\n\nBut experts say people throw lots of other un-recyclable things in recycling bins including Styrofoam, soiled cardboard like used pizza boxes, wax paper, soiled napkins, pet food bags, dryer sheets, shredded paper in plastic bags, garden hoses, plastic straws, zip lock bags, bubble wrap, cereal box bags and all kinds of construction waste.\n\nDeVivo estimates that his company has to send 60-70 tons a week of un-recyclable materials to an incinerator in the eastern Connecticut town of Lisbon to be burned.\n\nKlee said his agency has used a statewide advertising effort to educate people on what can be recycled and what shouldn\u2019t be put in recycling bins.\n\nThe commissioner said that, despite the problems of markets for recycled materials, rising disposal costs and \u201cwishful recyclers,\u201d there continue to be major benefits from the recycling effort.\n\n\u201cIn general, costs are still lower than having to handle regular municipal waste,\u201d Klee said, adding he doesn\u2019t know how long these current recycling troubles will continue.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a crystal ball on this one,\u201d Klee said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Hartford Courant, http://www.courant.com", "", "", "DAVIE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Frank Gore walked slowly through the Miami Dolphins locker room Monday, a slight hunch in his posture and a slight limp in his gait, which made him look like the 35-year-old running back he is.\n\nAnd he\u2019s among the healthy ones.\n\nThe Dolphins (5-5) hobbled into their bye week thankful for the timing of the break. Coach Adam Gase gave his players the rest of the week off, and said if his team had a game Sunday, finding 46 healthy players to fill the active roster would be a challenge.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know if we\u2019d have enough,\u201d Gase said.\n\n\u201cThe bye week,\u201d gimpy left tackle Laremy Tunsil said, \u201ccame at the perfect time.\u201d\n\nFor one thing, the bye buys quarterback Ryan Tannehill an extra week to continue his recovery from an injured capsule in his throwing shoulder. After a period of rest he began a throwing program Sunday.\n\n\u201cThey said it was a good first step and he felt good, so that\u2019s a positive,\u201d Gase said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just progress through and see where we\u2019re at next Wednesday.\u201d\n\nThe goal remains for Tannehill to return for Miami\u2019s next game Nov. 25 at Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cIf we can get through this week and he feels great every day, then we\u2019ve got a shot,\u201d Gase said.\n\nThe odds seem against it. Tannehill was shut down after an earlier throwing program produced little progress, and missed his fifth game in a row Sunday when Miami was beaten at Green Bay.\n\nBrock Osweiler fell to 2-3 replacing Tannehill. And as the Dolphins lost for the fifth time in seven games, their injury list grew longer.\n\nSidelined were cornerback Bobby McCain (concussion) and receivers DeVante Parker (shoulder) and Jakeem Grant (calf). Both receivers underwent MRIs on Monday, and their injuries are not believed to be season enders.\n\nBy the final whistle, Miami was without five former first-round draft picks. That included starting tackles Tunsil and Ja\u2019Wuan James, who both missed the game with knee injuries. There\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll return against Indy.\n\nGiven the way the Dolphins\u2019 season is trending, it\u2019s surprising the Colts game could be pivotal in the AFC wild-card race.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in the hunt,\u201d receiver Kenny Stills said. \u201cWe need to get healthy.\u201d\n\nOr healthier, at least.\n\nLast week the Dolphins had 18 players on their injury report. But not Gore, the ageless veteran who ran for 90 yards in 13 carries Sunday. He became the first player to rush for 500 yards in 14 consecutive seasons, and hasn\u2019t missed a game since 2011.\n\nIn the Dolphins\u2019 locker room, that makes him an outlier.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine.", "WINFIELD, Ind.

(AP) \u2014 A small nonprofit is filling a big gap in the needs of area families having trouble feeding their kids.\n\nFilling in the Blanks distributes food to children in need in Fairfield County and beyond. The group provides meals to students who receive free or reduced lunch or have parents that are a part of the Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed (ALICE) population.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t qualify for free and reduced lunch, but they still need help,\u201d said Shawnee Knight co-founder Filling In The Blanks.\n\nFood is delivered once a week to about 1,450 students in 23 schools in Norwalk, Stamford, Greenwich and Bedford, N.Y. The mission has grown rapidly. In 2013, when the organization formed, it served 50 children, Knight said.\n\nRoxbury Elementary in Stamford was the first school to partner with Filling In The Blanks. Teachers there had growing concerns as students were coming to class hungry on Monday mornings. Sarah Arnold, a social worker at school, called a few food pantries in the area, but they all lacked the capacity to help. Then she hear about Filling in The Blanks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember the last time a teacher came to me and said that students were coming to school on Monday morning starving,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThat has stopped and the reason it\u2019s noticeable is because five years ago, I was hearing that all the time.\u201d\n\nStaying true to the it\u2019s mission, Filling In The Blanks asks school leaders to store food and distribute it to students on Fridays before they leave for the weekend.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a consistent food source\u201d for many families, Knight said. \u201cThey\u2019re not sure where their next meal is coming from.\n\nShe said they\u2019re faced with questions like, \u201cDo I pay to keep the lights on, do I pay to put food on the table, do I pay for the health insurance \u2014 and they\u2019re forced to make a choice sometimes.\u201d\n\nAccording to Feeding America, 31,540 (or 14 percent) of children are food insecure in Fairfield County. More than 430,000 Connecticut residents are food insecure and it would take almost $245 million to meet the population\u2019s needs, according to Feeding America.\n\nKnight co-founded the nonprofit with Tina Kramer after they saw a need for this kind of service. It started with just a few staff members, working out of a house in New Canaan. Five years later, Filling In The Blanks has three staff, 1,000 volunteers (60 of them children) and a warehouse that can process 4,000 bags of food in five hours.\n\nFamilies receive letters from participating schools at the beginning of the year that ask if they need the service. Roxbury Elementary School needs about between 130 and 150 bags of food per week, which is up from 65 when the partnership started five years ago.\n\nEach student can expect a range of different foods including soup, pasta, fruits, granola bars, mashed potatoes and other items. Each week there\u2019s something different, Arnold said. If families have children in-need that go to other schools, Filling In The Blanks will give the family multiple bags.\n\nOne mother who has two children at Maritime Odyssey Preschool in Norwalk said that before Filling In The Blanks, she was struggling to make ends meet. She has a 4-year-old and a 6-year-old.\n\n\u201cI was struggling because I don\u2019t have a stable job,\u201d she said. \u201cIt helps me because I don\u2019t spend a lot of money buying food and I have something extra in the fridge.\u201d\n\nShe works part time from and makes $150 to $180 per week. She\u2019s a single mother working at a fish market and said that now, \u201cAt least we have lunch and dinner every day.\u201d\n\nDonald Austin, executive director at Maritime Odyssey Preschool, said school leaders formed a partnership with Filling In The Blanks three years ago, hoping it would help students to do better in school.\n\n\u201cIt takes a village to raise a child and if the child is hungry at home or mom and dad is struggling, if we can take the stress off the family a little bit, the child will perform better here,\u201d Austin said.\n\nOn Friday mornings, Arnold distributes bags of food when Roxbury\u2019s students are finished with breakfast.\n\nShe said students aren\u2019t embarrassed when they pick up their bags because \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to be in the backpack club.\u201d\n\nShe and other school leaders explain to students at the beginning of the school year that people donate their precious time and money to help their fellow classmates who are in need. Arnold said she explains volunteers pack and transport the food to students, which is a lengthy process.\n\nWhen students understand that ample preparation is involved, respond better than if it wasn\u2019t prefaced that way, Arnold said.\n\nOne of the unexpected but positive reverberations of the partnership is it gives Arnold another point of contact with parents.\n\nFor example, she might tell parents about Filling In The Blanks\u2019 service and they may disclose that they are struggling with something else. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to get the conversation started with a family that might otherwise be too shy or reluctant to speak up,\u201d Arnold said.\n\nAs the holidays approach, Filling In The Blanks is preparing to distribute holiday backpacks. In December, they fill backpacks with pancake mix, syrup, hats, gloves, water bottles, toothbrushes and toothpaste, books, toys and other items.\n\nEach backpack costs $40 and donations are accepted on the Filling In The Blanks website, fillingintheblanks.org.\n\nAs the organization grows, Knight and Kramer said they\u2019re looking for support form of volunteers or food or monetary donations, no matter how big or small. The nonprofit doesn\u2019t receive funding from state or federal organizations and relies solely on fundraisers, volunteers and monetary donations.\n\nIn May, the organization hosts a golf outing in Bedford, New York.\n\nIt\u2019s most recent fundraiser was a culinary event in New Canaan. It\u2019s next event is a luncheon and fashion show on November 15 at Richards, a Mitchell store in Greenwich.

The Bills won 41-10. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Todd Bowles is staying put as coach of the New York Jets.\n\nFor now, at least.\n\nIt was business as usual Monday for Bowles, whose job status appeared extremely shaky after the Jets\u2019 embarrassing 41-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday , their fourth consecutive defeat that dropped the team to 3-7.\n\n\u201cWe picked a bad day to have a bad day,\u201d Bowles said during a conference call.\n\nNo doubt about it.\n\nFans at MetLife Stadium booed the team throughout and chanted for the Jets to fire Bowles. That sentiment was echoed by many fans on social media and sports radio Monday morning. Several published stories also speculated that the time to make a change would be now with the Jets heading into a bye-week break.\n\nInstead, owner Christopher Johnson opted to not fire Bowles.\n\nThe two were scheduled to have their usual Monday meeting later in the day, but no change in Bowles\u2019 status was expected.\n\n\u201cWhat gives me faith that I\u2019m the right guy? I coach football,\u201d Bowles said. \u201cAs a coach, you go back to the drawing board. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. We\u2019ll come back and we\u2019ll prepare better and get ready for the next one.\u201d\n\nFor many, it\u2019s a surprise that there will even be another game for Bowles to coach with the Jets.\n\nHe is 23-35 during his run with the Jets, a .397 winning percentage that is better than just one coach in franchise history with at least 30 games in charge: Rich Kotite (.125). And, as anyone familiar with the team knows, that\u2019s one name you\u2019d prefer to not be associated with.\n\nThe Kotite years, when New York went 4-28 during the 1995-96 seasons, are synonymous with losing. It\u2019s not nearly as bad with Bowles. But there hasn\u2019t been much winning, either.\n\nThe Jets got off to a promising start under Bowles, who guided New York to a 10-6 record in 2015 but fell a win shy of the playoffs in his first season \u2014 losing a win-and-in game against Buffalo in the regular-season finale. Many expected the Jets to take the next step under the coach, who was considered a terrific defensive mind in stops in Miami, Philadelphia and Arizona.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nConsecutive 5-11 seasons followed, and now there\u2019s this increasingly dismal one, in which even five wins might be tough to come by. And, Bowles doesn\u2019t need to look far to point blame.\n\n\u201cI take all of it,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s the noble approach, but there\u2019s plenty of culprits: playing a rookie quarterback in Sam Darnold; a struggling offense under coordinator Jeremy Bates; a wildly inconsistent defense and a lack of overall roster depth \u2014 something that is a big strike against general manager Mike Maccagnan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t talk about my job status, but we know we get paid in this league to win football games,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re 3-7 and we\u2019ve got to do a better job.\u201d\n\nThe fan base is understandably frustrated and restless, and keeping things status quo will do little to appease those who wanted to wake up Monday morning to the news that Bowles was gone.\n\nSo, the fired-up criticisms at the stadium and on the airwaves will continue, and Bowles knows it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my first rodeo,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you win games, people cheer. When you lose games, people boo. I get it. It\u2019s part of sports.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, it would have been a bigger surprise if the Jets had fired Bowles at this point. Parting ways with a head coach in the middle of the season is rare for the franchise, and has never happened since Woody Johnson purchased the team in 2000.\n\nThe last in-season coaching change for the Jets came in 1976, when Lou Holtz resigned with one game remaining. The last coach to be fired was Charley Winner in 1975, when he was replaced by Ken Shipp for the final five games.\n\nChristopher Johnson, who is running the team while his brother has the role of U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom, apparently believes it\u2019s better to see the rest of the season through with Bowles and make the final decision on the coach \u2014 and, perhaps, on Maccagnan \u2014 after the final game.\n\nAfter all, there\u2019s no other coach on the current Jets staff with previous NFL head coaching experience. Only wide receivers coach Karl Dorrell has even major college head coaching experience. So there would have been no clear-cut option to take over to finish the season.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there won\u2019t be any changes. Bowles wasn\u2019t considering shaking up his coaching staff at this point, but wouldn\u2019t rule it out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll focus on everything,\u201d Bowles said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one thing when you\u2019re 3-7 toward the bye. The self-evaluation starts with me, then the coaches, then the players. So, I\u2019ll make sure I cover everything.\u201d\n\nThis could all be moot in seven weeks, of course, when the Jets could \u2014 and likely will \u2014 move forward without Bowles. But until then, he\u2019s focused on somehow figuring out how to salvage this rapidly deteriorating season.\n\n\u201cYeah, it comes with winning,\u201d he said. \u201cWinning turns things around.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "BENTONVILLE, Ark.

Running time is my me time.\u201d\n\nZambon started running marathons three years ago and said she tries to do at least one or two a year. She saw a post on the Great Wall Marathon pop up on her Facebook feed about a month ago and asked Allen if \u201cshe was crazy enough to do it with me.\u201d\n\nAllen said yes. The pair booked their flights two days later.\n\nThe China race, part of Albatros Aventure Marathons \u2014 which runs five destination marathons throughout the year, including events in Jordan, Greenland, South Africa and Myanmar \u2014 was founded in 1999 and has built a reputation as one of the world\u2019s toughest marathons. The race features 5,164 steps along the top of the Great Wall, making parts of the race feel more like a stair-climbing machine and less like a traditional marathon.\n\n\u201cSome of the stairs are broken,\u201d Zambon said.\n\nThat challenge has also changed her preparation.\n\n\u201cA lot of cross-training and distance running to get ready for the stairs thing,\u201d she said. \u201cMy plan is to just do a long run and then go super cold into a stair climber \u2014 the CCBA, outside, some stairs in the Dartmouth parking garage. I\u2019ll find stairs and run hills.\u201d\n\nRunning in exotic marathons isn\u2019t anything Zambon expected to be doing when she first started running competitively three years ago. But the community of runners she\u2019s encountered has helped cultivate her love for the sport, as much as the physical fitness involved in it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a common language,\u201d she said. \u201cIt brings all sorts of people together.\u201d\n\nOnce this is done, Zambon might move on to her next challenge.\n\n\u201cMy new favorite thing is to never say never,\u201d she said. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m never going to run a marathon\u2019 when I first started off, running half marathons. I used to say, \u2018Who\u2019d want to run a full marathon?\u2019 Now I\u2019m doing it.\n\n\u201cNext, I want to say my plan is to sort of hang up the running shoes.

(AP) \u2014 Elizabeth Yeznach remembers the advertisements seeking women between the ages of 17 and 34 to work in nursing, highlighting the job as a way to be of \u201cimmediate, vital service to your country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey spent a tremendous amount of money making it known,\u201d Yeznach, 92, said during a recent interview in her Gales Ferry home.\n\nShe was among the 180,000-plus women who signed up to be part of the U.S. Cadet Nurse Corps, a federal program established to address a nursing shortage on the homefront during World War II. By 1945, they were providing 80 percent of the nursing care in U.S. hospitals.\n\nIn 1943, Congresswoman Frances P. Bolton, a Republican from Ohio, introduced a bill to establish a government program to provide grants to nursing schools to train more nurses to serve in military and civilian hospitals, health agencies and war-related industries.\n\nKathleen Kingsley, 91, of Norwich, intended to become an English teacher but decided to go into nursing when the war broke out during her second year of high school. After graduating high school, she became a cadet nurse and worked at St. Raphael Hospital in New Haven. The three-year training was paid for by the government, and the women were given a monthly stipend.\n\nThroughout the years there\u2019ve been efforts to recognize cadet nurses as veterans. Yeznach has testified before Congress in support of such efforts. Reasons for the denial have included that cadet nurses were not federal government employees, but rather received federal scholarships and were allowed to resign at any time. Some civilians who participated in World Wars I and II are eligible for benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs, such as the Women Airforce Service Pilots, known as WASPs.\n\nThe 75th anniversary of Cadet Nurse Corps will be celebrated at a ceremony on Nov. 10 at the Waterford Country School.\n\nThe women have kept memorabilia from that time \u2014 pictures of them in their uniforms, their nurse pins, diplomas. They doubt many today know what they did, or their part in supporting the war effort. They say they weren\u2019t ever officially recognized for what they did, nor did they expect to be.\n\n\u201cThey forgot about us. We did it because it was our duty, and we willingly did what we had to do,\u201d said Emily Wildes, 94, of Groton.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t out on the front. My life wasn\u2019t in danger. We never thought of being veterans,\u201d Kingsley said.\n\nThen she got out her cadet nurse membership card, crinkled and worn from age, and began to read the pledge on the back:\n\n\u201cIn consideration of the training payments and other benefits that are provided to me as member of the US Cadet Nurse Corps, I agree I will be available for military or other federal governmental or essential civilian services for the duration of the war.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Patterson, 93, of Waterford said the lack of recognition doesn\u2019t bother her. \u201cWe would\u2019ve been doing it anyways,\u201d she said.\n\nBetween school and work, the women had little time off. Their training was well rounded. They staffed the hospitals, rotating between various units such as the medical and surgical floors.\n\n\u201cWe took care of the whole patient,\u201d Yeznach said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t specialists in any one area.\u201d\n\nThe majority of their patients were civilians. Yeznach worked at St. Francis Hospital in Hartford, where the largest ward comprised eight patients.\n\n\u201cWhen you went into a room with eight patients, you had all kinds of diagnoses. Some who were orthopedic, others who were medical. You were responsible for the housekeeping of the unit, as well. So when you had a discharge, you cleaned the unit and prepared it for the next patient,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring the day, there were a couple of registered nurses and a head nurse but \u201cby the second or third shift, we were it,\u201d Kingsley said, adding there was a hospital supervisor also working during those shifts.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of responsibility. Back then you didn\u2019t think much of it. They were training you to do these things and you were well supervised,\u201d she said.\n\nThey had to adhere to strict rules. During the first couple of months, when the women were known as \u201cprobies,\u201d they had a curfew of 9 p.m. and mandatory study periods. After the probationary period, they could stay out until 10 p.m. One of Kingsley\u2019s friends from Norwich was attending Yale University at the time and invited her to a dance. She told him what time she would have to be home.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t believe it. I didn\u2019t go to the dance,\u201d she said, laughing.\n\nThe medicine and equipment available to them was rudimentary compared to today. Penicillin was just becoming popular. Wildes recalled going to New Haven to receive training on how to use breathing machines to care for patients with polio. She also was trained how to treat patients with communicable diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis. Patterson, who roomed with Wildes, said they used ink pens and pads of paper to do their charting.\n\nSome of the women still remember their patients at the time. Yeznach took care of those injured in the July 6, 1944, Hartford circus fire, one of the worst fire disasters in U.S. history. The long-term care required and the severity of the injuries were challenging, but it was also a challenge dealing with their families.\n\n\u201cYou needed to offer support for them and explanations of what was happening as best as you could,\u201d she said.\n\nKingsley recalled a young boy, maybe 1 year old, who had a tumor of the kidney, for which there was no cure. His mother would bring him a box of Cheerios. Kingsley still can picture him eating Cheerios in his crib.\n\n\u201cThat was a heartbreaker when he died. But we knew it was coming. That\u2019s one of the things you have to put up with,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2Dk2S6T\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Day, http://www.theday.com", "HOWELL, N.J.

(Stephanie Zollshan/The Berkshire Eagle via AP, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Many small and independent retailers who are holding Small Business Saturday shopping events Thanksgiving weekend are banding together with others, believing that there\u2019s strength in numbers.\n\nSmall Business Saturday, started in 2010 to encourage consumers to shop in their small local stores rather than national chains and what are called big box stores, has become an event in neighborhoods, towns, even cities as retailers recognize they can draw more customers as a cohesive group than by offering discounts and promotions on their own.\n\nMama Java Coffee, an online coffee retailer, is joining with seven other online businesses that cater to mothers to offer a joint discount. A shopper spending $40 at any of the companies on Small Business Saturday will get $10 off purchases at the other seven. Kim Roman, owner of Mama Java Coffee, says the group, which will market the event on Instagram and other social media, came up with the idea just a few weeks ago.\n\n\u201cWe were chatting about ways to be unique and help promote each other,\u201d she says.\n\nMany communal Small Business Saturday events have grown to the point where they\u2019re organized by local chambers of commerce and community business organizations that have big marketing budgets. About 200 indie retailers throughout Portland, Oregon, are banding together in a marketing effort called Shop Little Boxes that will run from Friday through Sunday. The stores are offering discounts, many of them 10 percent, and shoppers get raffle ticket numbers for each visit and purchase they make. Shop Little Boxes has a smartphone app that shoppers can use to find participating stores and to register their raffle ticket numbers.\n\nRetailers say they do see sales blip up during Small Business Saturday, but their aim is also to remind shoppers that they are there year-round.\n\nThe event in Henderson, Nevada, like many others, is aimed at fostering goodwill; Shop Small Henderson will be a five-hour block party with activities for children. Parents may not be able to do much shopping during such events, but owners say they do return to shop after the party is over.\n\nLandlords also sponsor Small Business Saturday events at their developments. Pier Village, a residential complex in Long Branch, New Jersey, has about 30 retail tenants, and many will be taking part in a communal Small Business Saturday event.\n\nSome of the events aim at giving craft makers and artisans a place to sell their creations; about a dozen craft makers will take part in a pop-up event at Broadway Market, a retail complex in Seattle. And some companies with surplus space are inviting small vendors to set up shop on their premises \u2014 in Elmhurst, Illinois, Brewpoint Coffee is hosting small retailers in its roastery.\n\n_____\n\nFor more small business news, insights and inspiration, sign up for our free weekly newsletter here: http://discover.ap.org/ssb\n\n_____\n\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

If chosen for the job, Cheney would be the highest-ranked woman in the House GOP leadership in just her second term. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)\n\nCHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) \u2014 Liz Cheney has had a quiet first term as congresswoman, but that\u2019s about to change. She\u2019s seeking a House Republican leadership post that\u2019s key to her party\u2019s strategy against next year\u2019s Democratic majority.\n\nIf she succeeds, Cheney will be the only woman in House Republican leadership \u2014 and follow in the footsteps of her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who won the same post more than 30 years ago.\n\nShe is seeking the position of GOP conference chair, which would put her at the forefront of the House GOP\u2019s communications strategy when Democrats take over the chamber in January. House Republicans are looking for a more forceful approach to communications.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to change the way that we operate and really in some ways be more aggressive, have more of a rapid response,\u201d Cheney told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\nThe Republican leadership elections are set for Wednesday. The conference chair is the third-ranking position and comes with several duties, including organizing regular weekly meetings and developing the GOP\u2019s message to voters.\n\nCheney is running unopposed after the current chair of the conference, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, declined to continue in the post.\n\nCheney\u2019s father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, won the conference chair position more than 30 years ago after four terms as Wyoming\u2019s congressman. By landing the position after just one term, Liz Cheney would leave little doubt that she\u2019s a rising political star in her own right.\n\nBack home in deep-red Wyoming, most quit questioning Cheney\u2019s political chops a while ago.\n\nShe won re-election last week with 64 percent, beating a little-known Democrat. It was the widest margin in Wyoming\u2019s congressional race since 2014, when Republican Rep. Cynthia Lummis beat a Democrat living in Arizona whose campaign consisted of YouTube puppet and stuffed animal shows.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just been gathering strength as she goes on,\u201d said one of Cheney\u2019s primary opponents this year, Rod Miller, a retired ranch manager from the southeast Wyoming high country.\n\nSince winning office by a wide margin in 2016, Cheney has served on the Armed Services and Natural Resources Committees. More remarkably for a freshman member of Congress, she landed a seat on the Rules Committee, which sets the terms for floor debate on legislation.\n\n\u201cThat kind of is an indication that she has a constituency within the Republican conference \u2014 that she would be considered knowledgeable on issues, someone who is going to help advance the party\u2019s leadership agenda,\u201d said University of Wyoming political science professor Jim King.\n\nThe Republican conference chairmanship will be especially important now that Republicans look to rebrand themselves after losing the House majority, or at least improve their messaging to voters.\n\nDeregulation, such as rolling back parts of the Dodd-Frank banking reform law, and federal income tax cuts are important accomplishments that Republicans can sell to voters, Cheney said.\n\n\u201cI think now the American people will have a chance to compare what we accomplished and what the Democrats do now that they\u2019re in the majority,\u201d Cheney said.\n\nCheney would give a fresh face to the party in the No. 3 role. The top two jobs will likely by filled by Kevin McCarthy of California and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who are already in leadership. Yet having the Cheney brand at the forefront of the GOP communications apparatus could set a mixed tone.\n\nCheney\u2019s ascent will likely prove popular with GOP voters who recall fondly the George W. Bush-Dick Cheney years, especially those who favor a hawkish defense posture.\n\nAnd as a woman in leadership, she\u2019ll face questions about what Republicans acknowledge is a yawning gender gap as their side of the aisle is made up of mostly white men. After the midterm elections, the ranks of Republican women in the House declined.\n\nLess certain is whether Cheney\u2019s style will appeal to those voters in suburban districts, particularly women, who flipped Republican-held seats to Democrats this year. Republicans will need those voters if they hope to win back the House majority in 2020.\n\nCheney has seen little notoriety lately compared with five years ago, when she launched an ill-fated campaign to oust Wyoming\u2019s popular Republican senior senator, Mike Enzi. Labeled a carpet-bagger for having moved to Wyoming from Virginia barely a year earlier, Cheney made things worse by publicly feuding with her openly gay sister about gay marriage.\n\nShe bowed out eight months before the primary but didn\u2019t give up on politics. She continued touring Wyoming, forming \u2014 and in some cases mending \u2014 the relationships she needed to dominate a crowded U.S. House primary two years later.\n\nHer past experience as a Fox News commentator and State Department employee now give her valuable media and policy experience for the conference chairman job, Cheney said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity that\u2019s going to be focused on what it takes to get the majority back,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nMascaro reported from Washington, D.C.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mead Gruver at https://twitter.com/meadgruver", "US court says Vegas hospital must pay $820K in wages case\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Nevada\u2019s public hospital in Las Vegas has been ordered to pay nearly $820,000 in sanctions and attorney fees for failing to produce required emails, text messages and computer records in an ongoing federal employee wages lawsuit.\n\nUniversity Medical Center has until Dec. 5 to pay the penalty in the civil case alleging that thousands of nurses and other employees routinely worked through 30-minute meal periods for no pay, U.S. Magistrate Judge Peggy Leen said.\n\nAttorney Jon Tostrud declined Monday to comment about the case, which involves some 600 former and current employees.

(AP) \u2014 There were always signs that something was different about Emma Bullock, her mother said.\n\nOn one occasion, while they were watching an American Girl movie where the dyslexic main character sees letters moving around on the page, Rachel Bullock recalled, \u201cEmma turned to me and said, \u2018Mom, that\u2019s what it\u2019s like when I try to read.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut hunches and gut feelings didn\u2019t count for much in the more rigid world of public education, Ms. Bullock found over six long, frustrating years of watching her daughter flounder and then almost lose hope because of her condition. It was only this fall, at age 11, that Emma finally found a school that could provide the necessary amount of specialized instruction dyslexic kids like her need to learn to read, she said.\n\nA new law passed last month in the state may provide an easier path for dyslexic children in the near future, she and other advocates hope. That measure, the product of years of lobbying from dyslexia awareness groups and families with dyslexic members, will require all public schools to screen children for dyslexia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d Ms. Bullock said, but definitely not the final victory for parents like her who say they\u2019ve found the topic of dyslexia to be almost taboo in public schools. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the fact there\u2019s a huge lack of funding in public schools, or that there\u2019s a huge lack of education for teachers and administrators about what dyslexia is.\u201d\n\nWhile a common perception of the condition is that it causes people to misarrange letters when they read or write, the actual mechanics of dyslexia are more complicated than that, said Dr. Stephanie Blenner, a pediatrician at the University of Massachusetts Medical School who specializes in the disorder.\n\n\u201cThe primary deficit is phonological processing,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have difficulty seeing how words are made up of letter sequences, and that they correspond to sound.\u201d\n\nLike many learning disabilities, there are also levels of severity, although Dr. Blenner said as many as one-in-five people have some degree of dyslexia.\n\nWith the crushing effect of impeding literacy development - a handicap that can also hinder progress in math as well, since that subject is now more word-based than before - dyslexia can have lifelong repercussions, she said.\n\n\u201cThe human toll is huge,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are kids who otherwise can be very capable. I\u2019ve seen the downstream effects.\u201d\n\nThe disorder is also believed to be inheritable, a fact that plays into the Bullock family\u2019s story. Ms. Bullock said she believes she may be dyslexic herself - \u201cI really struggled in school,\u201d she said. But that hardly prepared her for dealing with her daughter\u2019s torment from the condition.\n\nAs a first-time mother, Ms. Bullock said she started crying after Emma\u2019s kindergarten teacher delivered the first assessment of her daughter.\n\n\u201cShe looked at me and said, very nonchalantly, \u2018she\u2019s going to have to repeat kindergarten,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nAttending the Worcester school system at the time, Emma was quickly falling behind her peers in reading comprehension. Mid-year, Ms. Bullock switched her to an \u201camazing\u201d new teacher in her school, but her daughter continued to have a hard time - and display a personality change that greatly troubled her mother at the time.\n\n\u201cShe was the most outgoing, happy, bubbly kid,\u201d Ms. Bullock said. \u201cBut she\u2019d have a complete meltdown when she went to school. I thought she might be anxious.\u201d\n\nBut when the Bullocks asked the school to test her daughter to find the root of her learning challenges, \u201d(the school administrators) really talked me out of it,\u201d she said, adding she was told they \u201cdon\u2019t like to label kids\u201d that early.\n\nWhen the family moved the following year to Holden, Emma\u2019s struggles continued in the Wachusett school system, as did Ms. Bullock\u2019s efforts to pinpoint her condition. Before leaving Worcester, they had managed to obtain an Individualized Education Program for Emma - a key legal document outlining her specialized education needs - but it was only for the vague category of a \u201clanguage-based learning disability,\u201d Ms. Bullock said. Whenever she pressed school staff to consider that Emma might be dyslexic, \u201cthey\u2019d swear to us up and down, \u2018we cannot make that diagnosis,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nEileen Hagerty, an attorney at the Boston-based firm of Kotin Crabtree & Strong who specializes in special education rights, said it\u2019s not unusual for schools to avoid identifying dyslexia in the lower grades.\n\n\u201cIt starts with the federal special education regulations,\u201d she said, which classify dyslexia as a \u201cspecific learning disability.\u201d \u2033Basically, the kid has to fail first, and that\u2019s not true of any other category of impairment. That means a lot of students don\u2019t get diagnosed with dyslexia until they\u2019re in third grade or older.\n\n\u201cA lot of educators, especially those in regular education, will say, \u2018just give them a little time.\u2019 But weeks, months (of education) get lost that way.\u201d\n\nEven after families present an official diagnosis of dyslexia for their child, some schools \u201cstill fight against it,\u201d Ms. Hagerty said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to say the word.\u201d\n\nThat was the case for the Bullocks, who finally, after exploring other possible answers like vision issues and anxiety, obtained Emma\u2019s long suspected diagnosis of dyslexia from the Center for Children with Special Needs at Tufts\u2019 Floating Hospital for Children while she was in fourth grade.\n\n\u201cShe high-fived me,\u201d Ms. Bullock said. \u201cShe was so happy. She was telling me, \u2018we were right, mom, we were right.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Emma\u2019s school didn\u2019t agree with the testing result, Ms. Bullock said. By fifth grade, her best option for getting the services she needed was to move into a language-based program at the district\u2019s Paxton Center School, where she would be alongside older, lower-functioning students with a broad range of learning disorders, according to Ms. Bullock.\n\n\u201cIt was the worst year of Emma\u2019s life for sure, and the worst of mine,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI would cry every day when I got home,\u201d Emma said. \u201cI\u2019d tell my mom, \u2018why can\u2019t I just be happy?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe frustrating part for Ms. Bullock is that they knew what Emma needed: consistent instruction in the Orton-Gillingham model, a nearly century-old teaching approach for dyslexic students. But in the public schools, she said, there wasn\u2019t enough resources or time to provide what the family believed to be a sufficient amount of that specialized tutoring - a reality she doesn\u2019t blame on the school staff.\n\n\u201cWe knew it was beyond the teachers and even some of the administrators,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunately about budgeting and staffing.\u201d\n\nBut Ms. Bullock said she still felt a growing urgency to advocate for her daughter - by this time they had hired a special education lawyer to represent them - especially as Emma descended deeper into a troubling emotional state. It was when Emma one day asked her about what happened to Kate Spade - the fashion designer who took her own life this past June - that Ms. Bullock realized she was at a critical crossroads.\n\n\u201cIf this is really what she\u2019s thinking, what am I going to do?\u201d she said she lied awake that night thinking. Even if there was an answer - putting Emma in a special private school program - there was also an even trickier question: \u201cWhere am I going to get the money?\u201d\n\nFinally this year, the family got what they wanted: an out-of-district placement at the Carroll School in Lincoln, which has one of the state\u2019s top programs for dyslexic students. Already, Ms. Bullock said, she and her husband, Adam, have seen a world of difference in their daughter, who not only receives the appropriate instruction for her disorder at her new school, but is also among peers going through the exact same battle.\n\n\u201cI like that everyone\u2019s just like me - I can just be myself, and not worry about feeling stupid,\u201d Emma said. On the contrary, being at the Carroll School has taught her to appreciate her condition: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s something bad,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just means your brain learns differently.\u201d\n\nThat renewed self-confidence may be the most rewarding outcome of the family\u2019s long struggle on behalf of their daughter, said Ms. Bullock, who recalled with sadness how Emma used to rattle off potential careers that wouldn\u2019t require any college or reading or writing in general.\n\n\u201cNow I want to be a lawyer,\u201d Emma said. \u201cOr to be an advocate for people like me.\u201d\n\nMs. Bullock said she\u2019s also become an advocate for the dyslexia community this past year, reaching out to politicians, community leaders, and anyone else she could think of with the influence to institute change in local schools. The statewide campaign that led to the passage of the screening bill last month began with similarly modest goals, said Nancy Duggan, executive director of Decoding Dyslexia Massachusetts, an advocacy group for the disorder.\n\n\u201cWe started out as an organization lobbying for some awareness,\u201d she said, but the abundance of new research into the condition over the last few years raised the stakes.\n\nOf particular importance, she said, have been recent discoveries into the efficacy of early intervention.\n\n\u201cIt makes a huge difference for kids - you can to some degree rewire the brain,\u201d said Dr. Blenner, who said early screenings look for indicators like family history, phonological awareness, alphabetic knowledge, and rapid naming - the last of which tests a child\u2019s ability to quickly name things shown to him or her.\n\nWhat the new law will require schools to do has yet to be sorted out, however; the bill requires the state\u2019s education department to develop guidelines for screening for dyslexia.\n\nAccording to school officials, testing for and remediation of dyslexia is already taking place in schools, and Tom Scott, executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, said it\u2019s unclear yet how much of a difference the new law will make on those efforts.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine we\u2019re going to find more (dyslexic) children than we would have otherwise, although I could be wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of these children will be identified at some point, and there would be interventions taking place.\u201d\n\nSchool officials he\u2019s talked to, meanwhile, have \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about the new measure, which creates yet another special education mandate they\u2019ll have to follow - and pay for.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question about it,\u201d Mr. Scott said, that dyslexia, like many other special needs, is putting pressures on underfunded districts. The fact districts will apparently have to shoulder the costs created by the new law, he added, \u201cis obviously a concern,\u201d even while education officials see the value of early screening for the disorder.\n\n\u201cIf additional screenings are to be required under the proposed law and through (Department of Elementary and Secondary Education) guidance, we are hopeful that the state provides funding to help offset the costs to already financially overburdened school districts,\u201d Wachusett Superintendent Darryll McCall said in a statement.\n\nMr. McCall said his schools already have screening procedures in place to identify students struggling with reading and/or writing.\n\n\u201cOur district is in the second year of a new reading program that will assist teachers in working with students who may have challenges with reading or writing,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the program progresses, we are hopeful that we will see a decrease in the number of students in need of additional support.\u201d\n\nMs. Bullock, meanwhile, just wants schools to acknowledge that dyslexia should and needs to be looked at as a distinct disorder.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not resentful\u201d after her ordeal with the public schools, she said, but she doesn\u2019t want to see other families go through the same thing.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about diagnosing kids and sending them all to the Carroll School - that shouldn\u2019t have to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should be able to service the most common learning disability in our (public school) districts.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, she said she and her daughter continue to try to raise awareness about dyslexia and provide support to other families. She is in the process of establishing a new support group in the Central Massachusetts area, for instance, that would meet monthly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lonely battle. You don\u2019t see people experiencing (dyslexia),\u201d Mr. Bullock said, adding if there\u2019s one silver lining to Emma\u2019s experience, it\u2019s that her daughter has embraced the role of speaking out about her disorder. \u201cShe\u2019s been the voice that\u2019s helping other people.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2RRrrLY\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Telegram & Gazette (Worcester, Mass.), http://www.telegram.com", "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.

(AP) \u2014 Los Angeles receiver Cooper Kupp is out for the season after tearing a ligament in his left knee, depriving the Rams\u2019 offense of a major contributor heading into a showdown with Kansas City.\n\nCoach Sean McVay on Monday confirmed the ACL injury for Kupp, who led the Rams in yards receiving last season. Kupp is likely to have surgery this week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge loss for our football team,\u201d McVay said. \u201cHe\u2019s such an important part of what we do, and a great football player, great person. It\u2019s tough, but fortunately we\u2019ve got guys that are ready to step up.\u201d\n\nKupp has 40 catches for 566 yards and six touchdowns this season, providing reliable hands in the slot and a knack for big catches. The former third-round pick from Eastern Washington has been a key contributor to McVay\u2019s high-octane passing offense in both of his NFL seasons.\n\nHis absence will be felt right away by the Rams (9-1), who will be without one of Jared Goff\u2019s most familiar targets when they face the Chiefs (9-1) in Mexico City next Monday night in one of the biggest games of the NFL\u2019s regular season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a valuable piece of our team, and a guy we\u2019ll miss,\u201d Goff said. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough guy (with) a tough family, and I know he\u2019ll come out stronger through it all.\u201d\n\nKupp was hurt on a play with minimal contact Sunday in in the fourth quarter of the Rams\u2019 36-31 victory over the Seattle Seahawks. An MRI exam confirmed a torn ligament for Kupp, who already missed two games last month with a sprained left knee after going down awkwardly on a horse-collar tackle by Darian Stewart in Denver.\n\nMcVay is optimistic about the Rams\u2019 ability to fill Kupp\u2019s role with a mix of receivers.\n\nRobert Woods, who leads the Rams with 55 catches, is likely to play more frequently in the slot. Fellow starter Brandin Cooks, who leads LA with 857 yards receiving, is likely to get more balls thrown his way after catching a season-high 10 passes against the Seahawks.\n\nAnd second-year backup Josh Reynolds is certain to get more playing time, particularly against the Chiefs.\n\n\u201cJosh Reynolds has definitely demonstrated he\u2019s more than capable,\u201d McVay said. \u201cHe is a starting-caliber player, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do moving forward.\u201d\n\nReynolds has just seven catches this season and just 18 receptions in his 26 career games, but the former Texas A&M star has earned the Los Angeles offense\u2019s trust while filling in for Kupp earlier this season. At 6-foot-3, he also provides a different size matchup on the outside compared to the smaller Cooks and Woods.\n\n\u201cI was sorry to hear about (Kupp) like everybody else,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cI\u2019m just doing my best to fill in there.\u201d\n\nThe Rams also could get receiver Pharoh Cooper back in their lineup soon. Last season\u2019s Pro Bowl kick returner has been sidelined since the season opener with an ankle injury, but McVay indicated the Rams are likely to make a decision this week on activating Cooper from injured reserve.\n\n\u201cHe would physically be able to play right now,\u201d McVay said. \u201cIn terms of if we decide to activate him back, those are a couple things that we have to talk through.\u201d\n\nThe Rams have been largely healthy this season, with a few glaring exceptions. Along with Kupp\u2019s struggles and Cooper\u2019s season-long absence, Los Angeles has been without cornerback Aqib Talib for the past seven games due to an ankle injury that required surgery.\n\nTalib said Monday that he still hopes to return when the Rams face Detroit on Dec. 2 in their first game back from their bye week.\n\nTalib also praised his replacements in the secondary and had encouraging words for fellow starter Marcus Peters, who criticized himself after last week\u2019s loss to New Orleans.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just part of playing DB,\u201d Talib said. \u201cI only know one DB who was like perfect all the time, and that\u2019s Prime (Deion Sanders). You\u2019re going to go through those stretches, but that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got short memories. That\u2019s why we play the toughest position on the field.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.apnews.com/NFL and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Clemson defensive end Clelin Ferrell (99) and teammates celebrate their 27-7 victory over Boston College in an NCAA college football game Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Boston.

He\u2019s even more thrilled for what comes next.\n\nSecond-ranked Clemson (10-0, 7-0 Atlantic Coast Conference, CFP 2) clinched its fourth straight ACC Atlantic Division title \u2014 and seventh in 10 years \u2014 with a 27-7 win over No. 22 Boston College on Saturday night.\n\nBut Simpson said the Tigers are focused on accomplishments beyond the division, including staying undefeated to maintain its status in the College Football Playoff poll.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re obviously not done yet,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cWe still have a lot ahead of us.\u201d\n\nThe next hurdle in that journey is Duke (7-3, 3-3) at home on Saturday night.\n\nA Clemson victory would complete its second perfect run in ACC play in the past four years since the national runner up team in 2015 started 14-0 before falling to Alabama in the CFP title game.\n\nTigers coach Dabo Swinney has long told staffers and players to enjoy the moment while keeping sight of what\u2019s next. Swinney said it\u2019s not easy to be expected to succeed and then go do it with team after team looking to take you down.\n\n\u201cI know people, fans, get caught up in bigger things like playoffs and all that stuff,\u201d Swinney said. But \u201cI still remember our first division win (in 2009) and I want to make sure that we enjoy\u201d clinching the latest one.\n\nNow, though, it\u2019s back to work when any loss could mean the end of Clemson\u2019s latest playoff run.\n\nAfter Duke, which is nearly a four-touchdown underdog, Clemson faces inconsistent rival South Carolina at home on Nov. 24 before facing the ACC Coastal winner \u2014 right now, Pittsburgh is in the driver\u2019s seat \u2014 in Charlotte, North Carolina on Dec. 1.\n\nClemson\u2019s offense continues to thrive with young players like freshman quarterback Trevor Lawrence a nd sophomore tailback Travis Etienne leading the way.\n\nThere\u2019s always concern, co-offensive coordinator Tony Elliott said, with newer players of letting up the intensity with the division race complete.\n\nElliott said Clemson\u2019s experienced leaders take control of setting expectations and the week-to-week tone of keeping focused and sharp.\n\n\u201cThese guys have big-picture goals in mind,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThey understand that in order to accomplish the big-picture goals that you\u2019ve got to take it one day at a time, one week at a time. The mentality for us is that each game is the biggest week of the season. And they know the fun is in the winning.\u201d\n\nClemson has certainly shown that down the stretch the past few seasons. The Tigers are 18-3 after October the past four seasons with two of those losses coming to the Crimson Tide in CFP contests.\n\nFreshman receiver Justyn Ross, who\u2019s second on the Tigers with five TD catches, said the newcomers entered the program knowing what\u2019s expected and don\u2019t plan to slip up.\n\n\u201cWe realize we\u2019re into a national championship phase, an ACC championship phase,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWe had fun winning the division, but there\u2019s more to come with it so we put that behind us now.\u201d\n\nClemson left tackle Mitch Hyatt, who set a program record for most snaps, missed much of the Boston College win after a couple of hits that injured his shoulder, Swinney said.\n\nElliott said Hyatt, a senior who passed up a likely high-round NFL selection last year for a final college season, felt better on Monday and would continue to receive treatment.\n\nIf Hyatt can\u2019t play, the Tigers would call on five-star freshman Jackson Carman once more. Carman, at 6-foot-5, 345 pounds, was the top high school prospect in Ohio last recruiting cycle. He filled in against Boston College and, in Elliott\u2019s view, performed well.\n\n\u201cYou talk about some of the high profile guys that come in the door and they just assimilate into the culture,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what leads to success.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "HEATHROW, Fla.

Lee.\n\nAs the top writer at Marvel Comics and later as its publisher, Lee was widely considered the architect of the contemporary comic book. He revived the industry in the 1960s by offering the costumes and action craved by younger readers while insisting on sophisticated plots, college-level dialogue, satire, science fiction, even philosophy.\n\nMillions responded to the unlikely mix of realistic fantasy, and many of his characters, including Spider-Man, the Hulk and X-Men went on to become stars of blockbuster films. He won the National Medal of Arts in 2008.\n\nRecent projects Lee helped make possible range from the films \u201cAvengers: Infinity War,\u201d \u2033Black Panther\u201d and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d to such TV series as \u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D\u201d and \u201cDaredevil.\u201d Lee was recognizable to his fans, having had cameos in many Marvel films and TV projects, often delivering his trademark motto, \u201cExcelsior!\u201d\n\nStan Lee, the creative dynamo who revolutionized the comic book and helped make billions for Hollywood by introducing human frailties in Marvel superheroes such as Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four and the Incredible Hulk, died Monday.

For decades he provided both young and old with adventure, escape, comfort, confidence, inspiration, strength, friendship and joy. He exuded love and kindness and will leave an indelible mark on so, so, so many lives. Excelsior!!\u201d\n\nLee considered the comic-book medium an art form and he was prolific: By some accounts, he came up with a new comic book every day for 10 years. \u201cI wrote so many I don\u2019t even know. I wrote either hundreds or thousands of them,\u201d he told The Associated Press in 2006.\n\nHe hit his stride in the 1960s when he brought the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, Spider-Man, Iron Man and numerous others to life. \u201cIt was like there was something in the air. I couldn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nHis heroes, meanwhile, were a far cry from virtuous do-gooders such as rival DC Comics\u2019 Superman.\n\nThe Fantastic Four fought with each other. Spider-Man was goaded into superhero work by his alter ego, Peter Parker, who suffered from unrequited crushes, money problems and dandruff. The Silver Surfer, an alien doomed to wander Earth\u2019s atmosphere, waxed about the woeful nature of man. The Hulk was marked by self-loathing. Daredevil was blind and Iron Man had a weak heart.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of Stan Lee\u2019s characters is that they were characters first and superheroes next,\u201d Jeff Kline, executive producer of the \u201cMen in Black\u201d animated television series, told The Blade of Toledo, Ohio, in 1998.\n\nSome of Lee\u2019s creations became symbols of social change \u2014 the inner turmoil of Spider-Man represented \u201960s America, for example, while The Black Panther and The Savage She-Hulk mirrored the travails of minorities and women.\n\n\u201cI think of them as fairy tales for grown-ups,\u201d he told The AP in 2006. \u201cWe all grew up with giants and ogres and witches.

In 1972, he became Marvel\u2019s publisher and editorial director; four years later, 72 million copies of Spider-Man were sold.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s become our Mickey Mouse,\u201d he once said of the masked, web-crawling crusader.\n\nLee also published several books, including \u201cThe Superhero Women\u201d in 1977 and \u201cHow to Draw Comics the Marvel Way\u201d the following year, when he was named publisher of the year by the Periodical and Book Association of America.\n\nCBS turned the Hulk into a successful TV series, with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno portraying the doomed scientist from 1978-82. A Spider-Man series ran briefly in 1978. Both characters were featured in animated TV series as well.\n\nThe first big-budget movie based on Lee\u2019s characters, \u201cX-Men,\u201d was a smash in 2000, earning more than $130 million at North American theaters. \u201cSpider-Man\u201d did even better, taking in more than $400 million in 2002. A Marvel movie empire would emerge after that, one of the most lucrative mega-franchises in cinema history, with the recent \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d grossing more than $2 billion worldwide. In 10 years, the Marvel Cinematic Universe film shave netted over $17.6 billion in worldwide grosses.\n\n\u201cBlack Panther\u201d actor Winston Duke took to Twitter to pay his respects to Lee: \u201cYou gave us characters that continue to stand the test of time and evolve with our consciousness.

He grew up a fan of \u201cHardy Boys\u201d adventure books and Errol Flynn movies, and got a job at Timely Comics after graduating from high school.\n\nWithin a few months, the editor and art director quit, leaving the 17-year-old Lee with creative control over the company, which grew and was renamed Atlas Comics and, finally, Marvel. Lieber changed his name, thinking Lee would be used for \u201csilly little comics\u201d and his real name would be reserved for novels.\n\nHis early work largely reflected popular movies \u2014 westerns, crime dramas, romance, whatever was the rage at the time. He worked for about 50 cents per page.\n\nAfter a stint in the Army during World War II, writing for training films, he was back at Marvel to begin a long and admittedly boring run of assembly line comic book production.\n\nComics in the 1950s were the subject of Senate hearings pushed by the Comics Code Authority, which frowned on gore and characters that questioned authority. Major comic book companies adopted the code as a form of self-regulation to avoid sanctions.\n\nLee said he was also working for a publisher who considered comics as fare only for children.\n\n\u201cOne day I said, \u2018This is insane,\u2019\u201d Lee told the Guardian in 1979. \u201cI\u2019m just doing the same type of stories as everybody else. I wasn\u2019t taking pride in my work and I wanted to quit. But my wife said, \u2018Look, why don\u2019t you do the kind of comics you want for a change?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe result was the first issue of \u201cThe Fantastic Four,\u201d in 1960, with the characters, plot and text from Lee and the illustrations by famed Marvel artist Jack Kirby.\n\nThe characters were normal people changed into reluctant superheroes through no fault of their own.\n\nWriting in \u201cOrigins of Marvel Comics,\u201d Lee described the quartet this way: \u201cThe characters would be the kind of characters I could personally relate to; they\u2019d be flesh and blood, they\u2019d have their faults and foibles, they\u2019d be fallible and feisty and \u2014 most important of all \u2014 inside their colorful, costumed booties they\u2019d still have feet of clay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man\u201d followed in 1962 and before long, Marvel Comics was an industry behemoth.\n\nLee knew his work was different, proudly noting that stories were drawn out over several issues not to make money but to better develop characters, situations and themes. He didn\u2019t neglect his villains, either. One, the Moleman, went bad when he was ostracized because of his appearance, Lee wrote, adding it was \u201calmost unheard of in a comic book\u201d to explain why a character was what he was.\n\nLee\u2019s direct influence faded in the 1970s as he gave up some of his editorial duties at Marvel. But with his trademark white mustache and tinted sunglasses, he was the industry\u2019s most recognizable figure. He lectured widely on popular culture.\n\nLee moved to Los Angeles in 1981 to head Marvel Productions, an animation studio that was later purchased, along with Marvel Comics, for $50 million by New World Entertainment.\n\nAs sales of comics declined, Marvel was forced into bankruptcy proceedings that meant it had to void a lifetime contract prohibiting Lee from working for anyone else. Lee later sued Marvel for $10 million, saying the company cheated him out of millions in profits from movies based on his characters.\n\nIn 2000, Lee agreed to write stories for DC Comics, reinventing Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and other signature characters for Marvel\u2019s one-time rival. DC Vice President and Publisher Paul Levitz had nothing but praise when the agreement was made.\n\n\u201cWith his artistic collaborators at Marvel, Stan co-created the richest imaginary universe a single comics writer has ever built,\u201d he said.\n\nThe dapper, friendly comic book genius continued to work into his 90s on numerous projects, including comics, films and DVDs.\n\nIn the late 1990s, he looked to capitalize on the Internet craze, offering animated \u201cWebisodes\u201d of comic-like action. Stan Lee Media also sought to reach out to Web-savvy youth through deals with pop artists the Backstreet Boys and Mary J. Blige.\n\nThe company went bankrupt, and three men were indicted for allegedly defrauding the business in a check kiting scam. Lee wasn\u2019t implicated.\n\nAfter that initial failure, Lee formed the successful Pow! Entertainment company to launch animated Internet-based projects.\n\nLee\u2019s wife and partner in nearly everything, Joan Lee, died on July 6, 2017, leaving a void that made her husband, by then in mental and physical decline, vulnerable to hangers-on who began to surround him. Lawsuits, court fights and an elder abuse investigation all emerged in the fight over who spoke for the elderly Lee.\n\nLee is survived by his daughter, Joanie, and a younger brother who also worked in comics, Larry Lieber.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer John Rogers contributed to this story", "SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) \u2014 Macedonian police sought the country\u2019s former prime minister late Monday, looking to arrest him to begin serving a two-year prison term following his conviction on corruption-related charges.\n\nInterior Ministry spokesman Toni Angelovski told The Associated Press that police issued a warrant for Nikola Gruevski\u2019s arrest on instructions from Macedonia\u2019s criminal court.\n\nOn Friday, judges rejected Gruevski\u2019s final appeal against serving the sentence.

Davidson says players lost a lot of leverage from that point.\n\nJohn Vrooman, a sports economics professor at Vanderbilt, says the decision to deny class-action status severely limited potential damages to the NHL owners as well as benefits for players. He called the settlement a \u201clopsided victory for the owners.\u201d\n\n___\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nOne retired NHL player who was part of the concussion lawsuit against the league is calling a tentative resolution an \u201cinsulting attempt at a settlement.\u201d\n\nDaniel Carcillo, who played nine NHL seasons and joined the lawsuit in June, posted several messages of displeasure with the settlement on his verified Twitter account. Carcillo urged his fellow former players, \u201cDo not accept this settlement for the concussion lawsuit,\u201d citing in part that they\u2019d see the same NHL/NHLPA doctors to determine eligibility for treatment.\n\nCarcillo also tweeted asking Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky for help, saying that \u201clack of pressure from former players is a direct result of this insulting attempt at a settlement.\u201d\n\n___\n\n1:45 p.m.\n\nEach player who decides to participate in the settlement of a concussion lawsuit against the NHL would receive a $22,000 payment and the potential for up to $75,000 in medical coverage.\n\nAccording to the settlement document in the case, 146 retired players are eligible because they joined the lawsuit, which was first filed five years ago. The total monetary value is just over $18.9 million, which includes a \u201cCommon Good Fund\u201d of over $2.5 million for other retired players who are not involved.\n\nPlayers have 75 days to decide to opt in to the settlement.

The lawsuit, consolidated in federal court in Minnesota and by far the largest facing the league, involves more than 100 former players who accused the NHL of failing to better prevent head trauma or warn players of risks while promoting violent play that led to their injuries.\n\nStuart Davidson, an attorney on the players\u2019 side, said the NHL is setting aside about $19 million for the lawsuit. That\u2019s significantly less than the billion-dollar agreement reached between the NFL and its former players on the same issue.\n\nAttorneys for the retired players say the settlement would include a cash payment for players who choose to participate; neurological testing and assessment for players paid for by the league; an administrative fund to pay for the costs and up to $75,000 in medical treatment for players who test positive on two or more tests.\n\nThe settlement would also set up a \u201cCommon Good Fund\u201d available to support retired players in need, including those who did not participate in the litigation.

(AP) \u2014 Five years from now, a plumber will be more important than an attorney.\n\nThat\u2019s what Cranney Companies President Brian Cranney joked last week, before a North Shore Chamber of Commerce breakfast in Salem.\n\nHis point? There aren\u2019t enough plumbers to go around. Cranney said he doesn\u2019t have enough workers to staff all of the service trucks for his Danvers company, which provides plumbing, heating, cooling and electrical services, among others.\n\nBut there\u2019s a solution. Cranney has turned to Essex Tech\u2019s co-op program, to help train and recruit tomorrow\u2019s plumbers, electricians and HVAC technicians. His company is one of several in the region that rely on the technical school for future workers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the main artery of my business on the North Shore and how I\u2019ve been able to grow it,\u201d Cranney said. Many of the leaders in his company today were first hired as high school juniors. They went on to get their various licenses and work for Cranney full-time.\n\nEssex Tech\u2019s co-op program places juniors and seniors with businesses in various fields such as plumbing, electrical, advanced manufacturing, culinary arts and construction, to name a few.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the culmination of a student\u2019s program, really,\u201d said Lisa Berube, Essex Tech\u2019s cooperative education coordinator. \u201cThey come here and they get the skills and the training to be able to enter the workforce, so the cooperative education program is that next piece, if you will, that gets them into the workforce out of the school setting to apply those skills.\u201d\n\nThe students work in a co-op job for one week, then take high-school academic courses the following week, off and on throughout the school year. They often earn more than the minimum wage.\n\nCulinary arts sophomore Emma Bedard, 15, of Salem, said she is looking forward to joining the co-op program next year. Bedard, who aspires to be a baker, was working at the school\u2019s Maple Street Bistro last week.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s amazing because you can actually get the skills and everything you need and it helps you get jobs going out of high school,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty close experience to the real world,\u201d said sophomore Jack Donovan, 16, of Peabody, about what he\u2019s doing in the school\u2019s advanced manufacturing shop. Donovan said he had been thinking about a future in mechanical engineering, but the skills he is learning now are closely related.\n\n\u201cI also like using my hands and getting dirty. It\u2019s just such a fun shop to learn in,\u201d said Donovan, who plans to work in a co-op job next year.\n\nThe demand to attend Essex Tech has skyrocketed.\n\nThe school has gone from under 1,200 students in 2014 to 1,421 students in 25 career and technical programs. Of the 1,200 applications it gets each year, it only has 375 slots.\n\nThe regional school is the result of a merger of the former North Shore Tech, Essex Aggie and Peabody high school vocational programs. While it opened several years ago, Superintendent-Director Heidi Riccio, the guest speaker before the North Shore Chamber last week, said the school is already running out of space in some trade areas, including plumbing.\n\nRiccio said the school depends on business leaders like Cranney to show the school what it needs to train its students.\n\n\u201cWe also look at them as partners,\u201d Riccio said. \u201cThey not only hire our students, but we are also hoping to start an adult education program to train existing workforce within that industry, as well as future workforce.\u201d\n\nThe construction trades are booming, and that means Essex Tech co-op students are in demand, said Bonnie Carr, the school\u2019s community relations and partnership coordinator, who also undertakes workforce development.\n\n\u201cThe kids go out, they work. They (employers) keep them through the summer. They work all of their senior year, and then they pick them up after graduation,\u201d Carr said.\n\nCarr said there is a demand for students in culinary arts, given Salem\u2019s restaurant boom. There is also a demand for those studying in health care fields. Last year, North Shore Medical Center took six students who worked in various areas of the hospital, including the emergency room.\n\n\u201cOur high school nursing students,\u201d Riccio said, \u201cwere working alongside physicians, emergency medical technicians, RNs.\u201d\n\nLast week, Essex Tech\u2019s plumbing shop was filled with the sounds of banging as students worked on projects in tall, plywood booths.\n\nRiccio said the program has expanded to the point it ran out of space for booths. So, the students built more.\n\nJim Russell, the grade 11 and grade 12 plumbing instructor, is in charge of connecting students with North Shore plumbing and heating companies. He said his students are in \u201chuge\u201d demand.\n\n\u201cYou know, the kids with the skills here you can\u2019t get this education even if you are an adult. This doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Russell said. \u201cIt only exists here, and with only 15 to 18 kids per class, you know, they have skills that you can\u2019t get at any other place.\n\n\u201cThey know how to do everything,\u201d Russell said. \u201cSo, the employers like that because they can train them the way they want them but they have the basic, raw talent to work with.\u201d\n\nRussell noted there is a shortage of plumbers. Their average age in Massachusetts is 55. But the base wage of an experienced union plumber is approximately $55 an hour, Russell said. Benefits can boost this wage to more than $80 an hour.\n\n\u201cThese kids are going to find themselves in a really good job market,\u201d said plumbing instructor Karl Jacobson. The connection to local plumbing businesses through the co-op program is vital. Many Essex Tech graduates stay with the company they worked for in high school.\n\nIn the school\u2019s advanced manufacturing shop, where future machinists work on high-tech, precision manufacturing lathes and mills, Riccio noted wages for machinists range from $16 to $100 an hour. Some students are able to work weekends making $30 to $40 an hour.\n\nInstructor Jack Fraizer said from what the students are learning, they can go right into a shop after they graduate. And they are in demand, now, because many people stopped going into the field when work moved overseas.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t even give them enough students because we don\u2019t have enough to give to them,\u201d Fraizer said. \u201cRight now the demand for just certain companies I know of ... One just said they need 300 people within the next year.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2T9G8eq\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Salem (Mass.)

(AP) \u2014 A top Rhode Island House Democrat has proposed creating a formal procedure for handling allegations of sexual harassment in the state legislature.\n\nRep. Chris Blazejewski, House deputy majority whip, said Monday that he\u2019ll file legislation to require the General Assembly to employ an equal employment opportunity officer, who would investigate complaints of harassment or retaliation, and create a committee on professional conduct that could recommend discipline, WPRI-TV reported. The full House or Senate would vote on the recommendation.\n\nFormer Democratic Rep. Cale Keable was recently removed as chairman of the powerful House Judiciary Committee after a months-old email surfaced in which another lawmaker accused him of sexual harassment. Keable was not re-elected. His lawyer has denied that Keable harassed Democratic Rep. Katherine Kazarian.\n\nDemocratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello was criticized for not doing more to address sexual harassment after WPRI reported on the email about Keable. Mattiello has defended his approach and said he\u2019s working with Blazejewski on the proposed legislation.\n\nCurrently, formal complaints of sexual harassment in the House must be filed with the Joint Committee on Legislative Services, the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, according to Mattiello\u2019s office. Mattiello has said he\u2019s not the proper person to handle such a complaint.\n\nThat approach appears to differ from how an allegation would be handled in the state Senate. In the state Senate, Spokesman Greg Pare has said that senators could report harassing behavior to the Senate president, as well as to the Joint Committee on Legislative Services, which is the legislature\u2019s human resources department, or to the human rights commission. The Senate has a process for expelling a senator.\n\nCommon Cause Rhode Island, a good government group, said the House would also need to adopt rules allowing it to censure or expel members, otherwise there\u2019s no mechanism to act on a disciplinary recommendation.\n\nBlazejewski said it\u2019s critical that the General Assembly reform its policies and procedures related to harassment and retaliation.\n\nKazarian said she\u2019s interested in working on ways to protect people in the legislature from sexual harassment.\n\n\u201cAll legislators deserve to represent their communities and engage in the political process free from harassment and retaliation,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe legislative session begins in January.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: WPRI-TV, http://www.wpri.com", "FILE - In this Nov. 11, 2018, file photo, Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield (6) and strong safety Damarious Randall celebrate after a 28-16 win over the Atlanta Falcons in an NFL football game, in Cleveland.

Greatly improved.\n\nTwo weeks after coach Hue Jackson\u2019s long overdue firing, the Browns showed a glimpse of a brighter future with their best all-around game in several seasons, a convincing 28-16 victory on Sunday over the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nTaking their cues from Mayfield and interim coach Gregg Williams, whose odds of becoming Cleveland\u2019s next full-time coach may not be as ridiculous as they once seemed, the Browns (3-6-1) took apart a team with playoff hopes.\n\nCleveland was balanced on offense, sound defensively and the Browns\u2019 special teams avoided the kind of fatal mistakes that led to so many tough losses earlier this season.\n\n\u201cWe just finally put four quarters of football together,\u201d said safety Damarious Randall. \u201cJust to see us put it together now shows where this team is pointing and the direction we are going. We are going to keep on building on that and keep fighting.\u201d\n\nMayfield\u2019s leading the charge.\n\nMatched up against one of the NFL\u2019s best in Matt Ryan, Mayfield was nearly perfect while outplaying his more celebrated quarterbacking counterpart. Mayfield completed his first 13 passes, finished 17 of 20 for 217 yards and threw three touchdown passes as the Browns posted their largest win since Dec. 13, 2015 \u2014 a span of 44 games.\n\nWhen it ended, with the rare sight of Cleveland fans actually still in their seats cheering and not heading toward the exits, Mayfield met Ryan and shared a hug with Atlanta\u2019s star at midfield before filming a promotional selfie video for the team\u2019s website and then sprinting off like a 10-year-old and leaping and bumping with Randall in the end zone.\n\nMoments later, Mayfield playfully told reporters he woke up feeling \u201cpretty dangerous.\u201d He\u2019s been scary over the past four weeks, throwing nine TD passes with just two interceptions and making better decisions.\n\nIt was Mayfield\u2019s second game with offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchens, the team\u2019s running backs coach thrust into the coordinator\u2019s role when Todd Haley was fired after Jackson on Oct. 29. Kitchens has catered Cleveland\u2019s offense to suit Mayfield\u2019s strengths, and his quicker throws have been effective in moving the ball and keeping him safe.\n\nFor the first time this season, the Browns did not give up a sack.\n\nWilliams said the Mayfield-Kitchens pairing will only get better.\n\n\u201cBoth of their styles and both of their personalities, they respect each other,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThey both understand each other. When that respect is well enough, maybe they might even like each other later on, but there has to be a respect of those and us together with coaches and players that we both are on the same page and we know what we are doing for things to grow. I think Freddie and Baker are doing a great job with that.\u201d\n\nWilliams, too, should take a bow. In no time, he\u2019s made the Browns better.\n\nSometimes brash and boastful, Williams has toned down his public personality while providing strong, needed leadership to a team that had tuned out Jackson after two losing seasons. The Browns are responding to the 60-year-old Williams, who coached Buffalo from 2001-03 and worked his way back up the ranks after he was suspended by the league in 2012.\n\nWilliams laughed hard when asked if the past two weeks have reminded an \u201cold timer\u201d he still had what it takes to be a head coach.\n\n\u201cI never thought it left,\u201d he said.\n\nBut as far as his future in Cleveland, Williams insists he\u2019s not campaigning for the job. At this point, the Browns\u2019 play is doing the lobbying for him.\n\nWhen pressed about whether he would like to be the next coach of the Browns, Williams showed a politician\u2019s elusiveness.\n\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d he said on a conference call as the Browns began their bye week. \u201cI like being employed. I enjoy the head coaching part of it. I enjoy all these parts of it, but understand the big part of what we are doing is we get the players the focus, get me to focus on one day at a time and we have to keep on moving on in the right direction.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Williams only planned to give his players Tuesday off, but \u201cthrew them a bone\u201d following the win and gave them Monday as well. The players are free this week with the exception of medical treatments and phone meetings. ... Williams said LT Greg Robinson \u201cplayed well\u201d in his second start, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll stay in the lineup following the bye. Rookie Desmond Harrison started Cleveland\u2019s first eight games before being sidelined with an unspecified illness.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Family attorney says Marvel giant Stan Lee, the architect of the contemporary comic book, has died at age 95", "ST.

Buffalo Bills coach Sean McDermott says rookie quarterback Josh Allen will reclaim the starting job should he be healthy when the team returns from its bye week off. McDermott made the announcement Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, a day after journeyman backup Matt Barkley threw two touchdowns in a 41-10 win at the New York Jets. (AP Photo/Eric Christian Smith, File)\n\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 It appears as if journeyman quarterback Matt Barkley\u2019s successful debut as the Buffalo Bills starter will be limited to one outing.\n\nA day after a 41-10 win at the New York Jets, in which Barkley breathed life into an anemic offense in his first NFL start in nearly two years, coach Sean McDermott on Monday announced rookie Josh Allen will reclaim the starting job once he\u2019s healthy.\n\nWith the Bills entering their bye week, there\u2019s a very good chance of Allen being back behind center on Nov. 25, when Buffalo (3-7) next takes the field hosting the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\n\u201cJosh is our starter when healthy, and his development is important for him and for us as we move forward, getting experience,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen a lot of quarterbacks this season play, and it\u2019s important that he gets as many reps as he can get in live game action.\u201d\n\nOne quarterback who will no longer be in the mix is turnover-prone backup Nathan Peterman, who was released by the Bills later in the day.\n\nAllen is 2-3 as a starter, and has missed four games since spraining his right throwing elbow. The first-round draft pick began testing his arm on Nov. 2, and spent all of last week practicing on a limited basis. He wasn\u2019t ruled out from playing against the Jets until Saturday.\n\nMcDermott said Allen continues to make progress and threw passes earlier in the day.\n\nAllen\u2019s status, however, doesn\u2019t diminish what Barkley accomplished in helping Buffalo snap a four-game skid less than two weeks after signing with the Bills.\n\n\u201cI liked the look in his eye and the energy he gave our offense,\u201d McDermott said of Barkley, now on his sixth team in six seasons.\n\nIn being the fourth quarterback to start for the Bills this season, Barkley was the first to complete two touchdown passes, including one to left tackle Dion Dawkins, and finishing 15 of 25 for 232 yards passing. He oversaw an offense that set season-highs in points, total yards (451), yards rushing (212), first downs (23) and converted eight of 16 third-down opportunities.\n\nThe 41 points alone topped the 33 Buffalo combined to score in its previous four games, and marked nearly half of the 96 points the Bills scored through their first nine games.\n\nJust as important, Barkley didn\u2019t commit a turnover after Buffalo\u2019s quarterbacks combined for 12 interceptions \u2014 three of them returned for touchdowns \u2014 and three lost fumbles in their previous six games.\n\nRookie Robert Foster had three catches for 105 yards receiving in becoming Buffalo\u2019s first player to top 100 since Deonte Thompson had 107 in a 30-27 win over Tampa Bay on Oct. 22, 2017.\n\nEven running back LeSean McCoy benefited by scoring twice to end a 10-game scoring drought, dating to last season. With 113 yards rushing, McCoy also topped 100 for the first time since gaining 156 on a snow-covered field in a 13-7 overtime win against Indianapolis last Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cI knew that I could play in this league,\u201d Barkley said after improving his career record to 2-5. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be cliche by saying it\u2019s like riding a bike, but I\u2019ve done this for years. I believe I was made to play football, and tonight was just an example of going out there and doing what I was made to do.\u201d\n\nIn the big picture, the Bills are grooming Allen \u2014 not Barkley \u2014 to be their long-term starter.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something to be said for energy and momentum and what not, but at the same time I know what Josh can do,\u201d McDermott said, when asked if he considered sticking with the hot hand in Barkley.\n\nPerhaps, he added, Barkley provided Allen a blueprint of how the Bills can succeed.\n\nAllen showed the telltale signs of being a rookie in going 75 of 139 for 832 yards with two touchdowns and five interceptions in five-plus games before he was hurt. Allen also had 155 yards rushing and three touchdowns, though he was occasionally knocked for being too eager to scramble out of the pocket.\n\nPeterman was released after McDermott said he maintained confidence in the second-year player.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t apparent in McDermott\u2019s actions in starting Barkley against the Jets, a week after Peterman threw three interceptions in a 41-9 loss to Chicago. Peterman was selected in the fifth round of the 2017 draft out of Pittsburgh and wound up throwing 13 interceptions in nine career appearances, including playoffs.\n\nPeterman began this year as the starter, before losing the job early in the third quarter of a 47-3 season-opening loss at Baltimore.\n\nHe\u2019s best remembered for throwing five interceptions in the first half of his first career start in a 54-24 loss at the Los Angeles Chargers a little under a year ago.\n\nDerek Anderson is the third quarterback on Buffalo\u2019s roster, and has missed two games because of a concussion.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "SPRINGFIELD, Mass.

The voice actor must be certified by \u201cStar Wars\u201d executives.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a day that we come to work where we don\u2019t feel very lucky,\u201d said Tim Palmioli, director of operations at Atwater. \u201cTo be able to do what we do, to work with these iconic Lego toys that we all grew up with. All the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 characters. Its just so special.\u201d\n\nLego uses the videos it has Atwater make as those short ads that play before YouTube videos, and Lego also features them on its social media feeds like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.\n\nIn October, Atwater won awards at the 58th annual Hatch Awards at the House of Blues in Boston. The company won a silver award for an animated Lego \u201cStar Wars\u201d piece and two bronze awards for another Lego \u201cStar Wars\u201d piece and a Lego Marvel Superhero short.\n\nSometimes the videos are animated, sometimes its live action with kids, sometimes there are grownup and kid actors hired to portray a family playing with Legos.\n\nAtwater has also shot Lego toys for box covers. One trick, director of photography Victor Janczar said, is to get super close with a wide-angle lens normally reserved for landscapes. The resulting image has a heroic quality and looks more lifelike.\n\nPhotographing inanimate objects can be a challenge, he said. Take the products made by Excel Dryer of East Longmeadow. The restroom hand dryers look great in person, but photographing all those hard, round edges made of various materials can be tricky. The light plays differently across the object.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, you are trying to photograph a chrome sphere,\u201d he said.\n\nAtwater Studios occupies 3,000 square feet on Warwick Street. Founder and owner Joseph Pellegrino Jr. plans to move into space five times as large in about 18 months, Palmioli said.\n\nIt\u2019ll be part of a redevelopment project of a former foundry building about a block away on Liberty Street, and Palmioli already has plans for the space: a soundstage and recording booth and what he calls a \u201clifestyle\u201d studio with fake walls that can be dressed as a kitchen, a bedroom or a living room for photo shoots.\n\n\u201cWe really want to raise the level of creative (work) that\u2019s coming out of Western Massachusetts,\u201d Palmioli said.\n\nAnd in raising that level of excellence, make Western Massachusetts known as a place where companies can get their photography, animation, design and video work done.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason why local companies can\u2019t get their creative done here,\u201d he said.\n\nLocal stalwarts, like Smith & Wesson, use advertising agencies in Boston or even further away. Even longtime customer Friendly\u2019s uses Atwater only when it\u2019s test-marketing products. Atwater makes the menu inserts and table tents for local promotions. But if the product goes chainwide, the photos are reshot at a studio in Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cThey do great work,\u201d Palmioli said. \u201cBut we can do that here.\u201d\n\nAnd Atwater has been successful in getting work from Massachusetts companies. They do package design work for New England Treatment Access, the marijuana dispensary in Northampton.\n\nMat Dubord, creative director, showed a prototype cookie box Atwater is designing for New England Treatment Access. Not only are they worried about the font, the size, the color and the look, but also what type of cardstock is used and how the new box will feel.\n\nHelen of Troy Ltd., which opened a new headquarters in Marlborough in 2016 after being based in Texas in 2016, licenses brands like Honeywell and Pur and uses Atwater Studios.\n\nPalmioli showed an animated video of water moving through a Pur water filtration medium. It\u2019s for a presentation to Pur\u2019s in-house sales force, he said.\n\nAtwater ramped up video work last year when it bought Doodle Pictures, a 3D animation studio in Enfield. Both Doodle and Atwater work for Lego.\n\nThe animated videos start with a script, said Dan Konieczka, director of computer-generated images. Then they go to a storyboard, which marries the script to drawings of what the final animations might look like.\n\nThen staff refines the images while someone does what\u2019s called rigging. That\u2019s when animators digitally set up all the structures of the scene so that wrists bend where wrists should bend and so on.\n\nNext images must be refined and lighted digitally so they look right.\n\nIt can take months, Palmioli said.\n\nAnd Konieczka said Atwater Studios often works with just the barest of outlines. It\u2019s making videos now for Lego sets that won\u2019t come out until 2019.\n\nThe movies the Legos are tied to are not even done yet, and the studios certainly are not going to share plot points. That means no one can tell Atwater if two Lego characters are supposed to be friends or enemies.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why in Atwater\u2019s video for an \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d Lego set, stuff happens to comic book bad guy Thanos that doesn\u2019t happen in the movie.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s fine,\u201d Konieczka said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what would happen when kids start to play with the toy.

Publicly, Republican legislative leaders have said they might limit Evers\u2019 power to make appointments to the state economic development agency and other boards; put administrative rules governing the state\u2019s voter photo ID requirement into law, thereby making it more difficult to change; limit the governor\u2019s authority over the rule-making process; and prevent Evers from stopping federal waivers sought by Walker and the Legislature to force childless adult Medicaid recipients to work to receive benefits.\n\nVos told reporters Monday his goal was to protect laws Republicans enacted in recent years, such as voter ID and the Foxconn Technology Group project, from interference by Evers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want him to be able to walk in on day one and with the stroke of a pen undo things that the vast majority of the public supports and the Legislature and the governor signed into law,\u201d Vos said.\n\nDemocrats met with nonpartisan attorneys for the Legislature last week to ask just how far Republicans could go to take away powers from the governor\u2019s office. Specifically, they asked whether the governor could be removed from the process of redistricting, the process of drawing political boundary lines following the 2020 census.\n\nThe Legislative Reference Bureau, in a memo to Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz, said somehow enacting a redistricting plan without passing a bill the governor signs would be unconstitutional. Vos said Republicans weren\u2019t looking at changes to redistricting.\n\nAssembly Republicans on Monday voted unanimously to re-elect Vos as speaker, the post he\u2019s held for six years. Republicans return with a 63-36 majority, down only one seat from last session.\n\nAlso Monday, Evers announced that his campaign manager Maggie Gau will serve as his first chief of staff, a move that is commonly made following a successful run for governor. Gau, from Wausau, formerly worked as chief of staff for Democratic state lawmakers Chris Taylor, of Madison, and Janis Ringhand, of Evansville.\n\nEvers\u2019 transition team will be led by JoAnne Anton. She worked for more than 20 years for former U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl and is the director of charitable giving for Herb Kohl Philanthropies.\n\nOther members of the transition team are former University of Wisconsin board of regents President Chuck Pruitt; Marinette Marine President and CEO Jan Allman; Exact Sciences Chairman and CEO Kevin Conroy; Genesis Health Consulting CEO Dr. Veronica Gunn; and former middle school Teacher of the Year Amy Traynor, who works as an instructional coach for the Eau Claire school district.\n\nThe Legislature\u2019s Republican-controlled budget committee prepared to vote Tuesday on a request from Evers for nearly $95,000 to pay for expenses related to the transition.\n\nEvers, a former teacher and school superintendent, has served as Wisconsin state schools superintendent since 2009. He does not plan to resign that position until after he is sworn in, spokeswoman Britt Cudaback said. That will give Evers, rather than Walker, the power to appoint a successor.\n\n___\n\nFollow Scott Bauer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sbauerAP\n\n___\n\nSign up for \u201cPolitics in Focus,\u201d a weekly newsletter showcasing the AP\u2019s best political reporting from around the country leading up to the midterm elections: https://bit.ly/2ICEr3D", "Displayed is Alexander Hamilton's Society of the Cincinnati Eagle insignia at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia, Monday, Nov. 12, 2018.

He said a cardboard box containing the heirlooms was passed quietly from generation to generation, and stowed away until it passed on again.\n\nBut as Hamilton\u2019s legacy has re-emerged with the hit Broadway musical and a number of books in recent years, he has been embracing his ancestor and sharing his stories and objects. He even has a grandson named Alexander Hamilton who was born on what might have been the 250th anniversary of the Founding Father\u2019s birth. (His birthday has been speculated as Jan. 11, 1755 or Jan. 11, 1757.)\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important as time goes by to make sure they\u2019re remembered,\u201d he said Monday inside the workroom at the museum, where curators were preparing his loaned items, which also include a never-before-displayed handkerchief embroidered with Elizabeth\u2019s name, and a baby dress with an accompanying note saying it was made by her. Those heirlooms will be put on display in early 2019 after they undergo conservation.\n\n\u201cThese items give us a glimpse into the personal lives of Alexander and Elizabeth Hamilton and we\u2019re honored and delighted that Doug and his family have chosen to loan them to us,\u201d said Philip Mead, the museum\u2019s chief historian and director of curatorial affairs.\n\nThe Alexander Hamilton Awareness Society connected Doug Hamilton with the museum.\n\n\u201cHe just called me one day out of the blue and introduced himself and I said, \u2018Boy, this doesn\u2019t happen every day that a Hamilton calls you and offers to loan national treasures,\u2019\u201d Mead said. That Hamilton offered to drive the items to the museum himself to drop them off was even better, he added.\n\nAlexander Hamilton was an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati, which was founded by officers of the Continental Army at the American Revolutionary War. The pendant on loan has its original ribbon, which is significantly worn from use.\n\nDoug Hamilton said the last time Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton met before their fateful duel was at a meeting of the Society of the Cincinnati at Fraunces Tavern in New York City, and he speculates his ancestor was wearing the pendant during that last interaction.\n\nThe mourning ring dates from about 1804, and follows a common practice of the 18th century, encasing a lock of Elizabeth Hamilton\u2019s late-husband\u2019s hair under a glass jewel. She lived for more than 50 years after Hamilton was killed in the duel with Burr, dying on Nov. 9, 1854 at the age of 97.\n\nThe exhibit runs through March 17, 2019.", "ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Lawyers for a faith-based Anchorage women\u2019s shelter are not expecting a quick resolution to their lawsuit against the city over a requirement that it accept transgender women.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom filed a scheduling report in federal court Friday, noting tentative trial dates in April 2020.\n\nThe conservative Christian law firm earlier this month sought an injunction to stop the city from applying its gender identity law to the Hope Center shelter.\n\nThe federal lawsuit also names the Anchorage Equal Rights Commission, which became involved after a transgender woman complained she was denied entry at the shelter.\n\nAn attorney for the city has said the commission\u2019s investigation has not been concluded, largely because of the shelter\u2019s noncooperation.\n\nAlliance attorney Ryan Tucker did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment Monday.", "FILE - In this file photo dated Saturday, Feb. 3, 2018, Ireland's Jonathan Sexton, is caught by France players during their Six Nations rugby union match at the Stade de France stadium in Saint-Denis, outside Paris, France.

He\u2019s been training, and coach Joe Schmidt said on Saturday after beating Argentina that he\u2019d let Murray decide on his availability. On Monday, the scrumhalf was released from the squad for the rest of the month with center Robbie Henshaw, who injured a hamstring in the warmup and had to withdraw from the Pumas test.\n\n\u201cI obviously stayed in touch with Conor a lot over the injury to see how he has been getting on, and all the time (he\u2019s been) improving, but I suppose he\u2019s just trying to make sure he can get it right from now, and (it) not be an issue going forward,\u201d Sexton said of his long-time halves partner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably a smart thing. It\u2019s a big ask. If you\u2019re out for a few weeks and you\u2019re asked to play the All Blacks, that\u2019s tough enough. But if you\u2019re out for the period of time he has been out for, it would be a big step up.\u201d\n\nKieran Marmion started at No. 9 last Saturday and Luke McGrath was the reserve, and they should be the scrumhalves again against New Zealand on Saturday at Lansdowne Road.\n\nLosing Henshaw was a bigger blow, and puts pressure on Garry Ringrose to recover from the hip knock which ruled him out of the Argentina match. Will Addison stepped in to make his first start and didn\u2019t let Ireland down, but Ireland will want to restore Ringrose with Bundee Aki. They were the midfield when Ireland beat England in March for the Six Nations Grand Slam.\n\nSexton, up for world player of the year with two All Blacks, wanted Ireland\u2019s best on the field on Saturday.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t lie about it and say it\u2019s just another game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had it on our radar for a while, definitely.\u201d\n\nSexton helped Ireland beat New Zealand in 2016 in Chicago to end a 111-year drought, and said they want to add a first win at home, too.\n\n\u201cIt has been two years since we\u2019ve played them last but there has been a lot of changeover from our team,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to seeing how far we\u2019ve come in two years and where we are in the world really.\u201d\n\nIreland is ranked No. 2, and has a chance to be No. 1 for the first time.\n\n\u201cThese are the big games that you do all the work for, you do all the practice for,\u201d Sexton said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get a chance, you know, they\u2019ve been No. 1 team in the world for nine years, you\u2019ve got a small chance to change that.\n\n\u201cOver the years we\u2019ve ticked off a little bit of history along the way with winning in Argentina, winning in South Africa for the first time, beating New Zealand for the first time, so to beat them in Ireland for the first time would be another little bit of history that this group can create, and it\u2019s one you don\u2019t want to let pass you by.\u201d\n\nSexton has two wins and a draw in 11 matches against the All Blacks for Ireland and the British and Irish Lions and has a healthy respect for the challenge they pose.\n\n\u201cYou do get a sort of feel for what you have to do to beat them but then you\u2019ve got to go and do it. That\u2019s the hardest part.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ll have a great plan, we\u2019ll have some experiences of what\u2019s worked against them in the past, what hasn\u2019t worked, and where they are the most dangerous. But then you\u2019ve got to go out and implement it. Hopefully, that gets you close at the end and then dog it out.\u201d\n\nHe expects New Zealand to hit a purple patch, and then it\u2019s how well Ireland adapts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never played against a team that would capitalize on a mistake (so well). You look through the Rugby Championship, the amount of times you think Australia and South Africa have them under the pump and next thing they\u2019re underneath their own posts.\n\n\u201cIn Pretoria, when they came from behind, (the Springboks) are on New Zealand\u2019s line, they\u2019re 12 points up with 10 minutes to go and you think \u2018Game over.\u2019 They turn it over, go the length of the pitch and score. Then they score again.\n\n\u201cThey really expose you when you\u2019re loose with the ball and so everything is a bit more important this week.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "HONOLULU (AP) \u2014 A team of divers hauled in nearly 165,000 pounds (75,000 kilograms) of abandoned fishing nets and plastic waste during a cleanup expedition at Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, federal officials said.\n\nThe 18 divers left Sept. 19 and returned Oct. 29 from a trek to the chain of isles and atolls located 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers) northwest of the main Hawaiian islands, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which runs the expeditions.\n\nThe divers hauled in about 82 tons (74 metric tons), which is comparable to the weight of 45 mid-sized cars or one space shuttle, NOAA said.\n\nThe team of divers from NOAA Fisheries and University of Hawaii\u2019s Joint Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Research sorted out the debris Friday, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported .\n\nThe group split the debris into categories such as plastic laundry baskets, fishing nets, tires, buoys and smaller personal-care items such as plastic toothbrushes and combs.\n\nPapahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument is uninhabited by humans.

(Steve Apps/Wisconsin State Journal via AP, File)\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Democratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers has some big ideas about how to change Wisconsin\u2019s overcrowded prison system. The questions now are: How will he do it and will Republican legislators let him?\n\nOutgoing Republican Gov. Scott Walker drew plenty of criticism over how he handled the Department of Corrections. He never visited a prison during his eight years as governor and was slow to react to abuse allegations at the state\u2019s youth prison outside Irma. Evers is trying to draw a stark contrast with Walker, beginning with a pledge to visit the youth prison during his first week in office in January.\n\nThe rest of his objectives are ambitious. He wants to cut the state\u2019s prison population in half, end solitary confinement and give ex-convicts more help. He hasn\u2019t said whether he\u2019ll start issuing pardons again after Walker refused to consider any during his tenure. Evers\u2019 spokesman Sam Lau didn\u2019t return a message seeking comment Monday.\n\nOne thing is all but certain: It\u2019s going to be an uphill fight as he struggles with a Republican-controlled Legislature.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really hopeful,\u201d said David Liners, executive director of WISDOM, a coalition of Wisconsin religious congregations working on social justice issues, including ending mass incarceration. \u201cThe fear tactics have stopped working and we can get back to saying, \u2018What\u2019s the rational thing here?\u2019\u201d\n\nEvers inherits a state prison system grappling with a host of problems. In addition to abuse allegations at the youth prison, the system incarcerated a record number of adults last year and the population is expected to only keep growing.\n\nRepublicans have been pushing to build a new prison and have warned that Evers would have to release violent offenders to reduce the population by half.\n\nEvers hasn\u2019t released a specific plan, but he has called for eliminating mandatory minimum sentences and to stop revoking convicts\u2019 parole and extended supervision unless they commit a new crime.\n\nEvers could make a strong push to end crimeless revocations on his own. Judges within the Department of Administration make revocation decisions based on recommendations from the Department of Corrections, and Evers will control both agencies. GOP legislators would have to sign off on eliminating mandatory minimums, however.\n\nThe governor-elect will also have to wrestle with a shortage of guards. The vacancy rate statewide was nearly 15 percent at the end of October, according to Corrections Department data.\n\nEvers hasn\u2019t addressed the shortage specifically. He has said he would like to restore collective bargaining rights for public workers, which might make prison jobs more attractive. Walker did away with union rights for most public workers in his signature Act 10 law in 2011. Restoring those rights would be difficult, if not impossible, to get through the Republican Legislature. GOP lawmakers overcame massive protests and public pressure to pass Act 10.\n\nEvers also has called for ending solitary confinement, a move he could make unilaterally. He also wants to improve ex-convicts\u2019 access to housing and jobs and bar employers from asking about job applicants\u2019 criminal history. He could loosen eligibility for housing and job programs on his own through Corrections Department policy, but devoting more money to such programs would take legislative approval. Barring criminal history questions on job applications also would take a green-light from the Legislature.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Michael Schraa, chairman of the Assembly corrections committee, said the state has \u201csome serious issues with overcrowding\u201d and called the guard vacancies an unsustainable \u201ccrisis.\u201d He said Evers and the Republican-controlled Legislature might find common ground on ending mandatory minimums. But he doesn\u2019t expect agreement on much else.\n\nRepublican Van Wanggaard, chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, said Evers sounds like he\u2019s \u201call over the board\u201d with broad proposals and will need the Legislature to accomplish his goals. He said he\u2019s \u201cabsolutely not\u201d in favor of eliminating mandatory minimums.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s had an opportunity to understand the gravity,\u201d Wanggaard said. \u201cYou try to say the things (during the campaign) you think may make sense. I don\u2019t want to lock more people up either, but in the same respect I don\u2019t want somebody who is a serious violent offender in my house at two in the morning, either.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Todd Richmond on Twitter at https://twitter.com/trichmond1", "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 Fishermen have launched a campaign to contain development and protect Portland\u2019s waterfront.\n\nThe Portland Press Herald reports a group of fishermen and their supporters gathered Sunday at Andy\u2019s Old Port Pub to collect petition signatures and start fundraising.\n\nDevelopers are currently proposing hotel and garage projects along the waterfront.\n\nLocal fishermen say development could harm fishing.

(AP Photo/Ed Zurga)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 The Kansas City Chiefs finally got Justin Houston back onto the field Sunday against Arizona, and the four-time Pro Bowl linebacker made one of the plays of the game when he picked off Cardinals quarterback Josh Rosen on a second-half screen pass.\n\nThe Chiefs also got safety Daniel Sorensen back from injured reserve, where he had resided since breaking his leg in training camp, and he five tackles while providing a hard-hitting presence.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s no surprise the Chiefs defense played the best it has all season.\n\nWith two of their anticipated starters back on the field, the Chiefs held the Cardinals to 260 yards in a 26-14 victory. They sacked Rosen five times, intercepted him twice and even managed to keep David Johnson under 100 yards rushing \u2014 just barely.\n\n\u201cI feel like the first couple weeks we were putting too much into it, trying too hard,\u201d linebacker Reggie Ragland said. \u201cWe\u2019re having fun with it. Whatever happens, happens. It\u2019s football. We\u2019ve been playing this game for too long for us not to have fun with it. It\u2019s a child\u2019s game and we\u2019re grown men playing it, so have fun with it. Don\u2019t worry about all that other stuff.\u201d\n\nThe Chiefs (9-1) sure looked as if they were having a ball Sunday.\n\nDee Ford had his ninth sack of the season, not to mention three tackles for a loss and four hits on Rosen. Allen Bailey had his fifth sack while Chris Jones had two more to give him a career-high seven for the season, including at least one sack in six consecutive games.\n\nAll told, Rosen was hit 13 times and fumbled once while throwing for just 208 yards and a score.\n\n\u201cThe one thing we\u2019re doing right now is we are minimizing big plays,\u201d defensive tackle Jarvis Jenkins said. \u201cThat is one thing we all play on is minimizing big plays, then getting them one-dimensional so we can rush the passer. I think we did that this game.\u201d\n\nThe only game in which the defense played nearly as well was Cincinnati, when the Chiefs allowed 239 yards in a 45-10 rout. But it\u2019s often easier to play stingy defense when the game has gotten out of hand, and on Sunday the Chiefs needed to show up in a game that Arizona managed to keep relatively close.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s happened a couple of times now, things have stalled out (on offense) then they step up and make plays,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \u201cThat\u2019s a great thing. We need that as a football team. We need that. It\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nEspecially given who is up next: The Chiefs are headed to Mexico City to face the high-flying Los Angeles Rams on Monday night in a matchup of two of the NFL\u2019s most dynamic offenses.\n\nThe Rams are second in yards-per-game and the Chiefs are third, and those rankings are flipped when it comes to scoring with Kansas City second and Los Angeles third.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s a good time for the Chiefs\u2019 maligned defense to start showing up.\n\nThey can still get a whole lot better, too. Middle linebacker Anthony Hitchens was out Sunday with bruised ribs, and backup linebacker Frank Zombo missed the game with a hamstring injury, giving undrafted rookie Ben Niemann a chance to start his first NFL game.\n\n\u201cI was still on four phases of special teams,\u201d Niemann said, \u201cso I got a little tired out there. But it was good. You want to play. You want to play as many snaps as possible.\u201d\n\nSomeone else who wants to play? Eric Berry, the Chiefs\u2019 star safety, who still hasn\u2019t played since tearing his Achilles\u2019 tendon in the season opener last year. Berry practiced throughout the summer and into training camp, but a heel injury has kept him off the field for months.\n\nIt would be another boon for the Chiefs defense if he can return in any effective capacity.\n\n\u201cSooner or later, it has to be the defense (stepping up),\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of being a team. You can\u2019t be one-dimensional. I think the feeling we have now is it\u2019s a good team. It wasn\u2019t pretty (Sunday) but we got it done. That\u2019s what we have to do.\u201d\n\nNotes: Reid said Monday he\u2019s not concerned about the field conditions at Azteca Stadium, where the combination of concerts and soccer matches have wrecked the turf. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it,\u201d Reid said, \u201cbut I think the NFL is on top of it. They do a great job with all that stuff.\u201d ... Reid said he doesn\u2019t expect Patrick Mahomes to miss practice after his girlfriend\u2019s stepfather died suddenly on Sunday. The Chiefs are off on Tuesday and Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s here this morning and he\u2019s got things set there, organized and settled down,\u201d Reid said, \u201cso he can do what he\u2019s got to do here.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "FILE - IN this Nov. 6, 2018, photo, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, listens during a news conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, at the presidential palace, in Kabul, Afghanistan.

He said most of the losses incurred by its security forces were in defending static positions, so the government was rethinking how it deploys its forces.\n\nSpeaking on Veterans Day, the Afghan leader paid tribute to American sacrifices in Afghanistan, including the death of Brent Taylor, a Utah mayor serving as a major in the state\u2019s Army National Guard who was training Afghan commandos. Taylor, 39, was fatally shot a week ago by one of his Afghan trainees.\n\nBut Ghani also offered a rare public accounting of the scale of the Afghan losses. He described how their casualties have risen sharply while U.S.-led coalition casualties have declined after Afghan forces assumed responsibility for combat operations in the country. He said that since 2015, 58 American forces have died in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cIn the same period, 28,529 of our security forces have lost their lives and become martyrs,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. military officials have previously indicated that Afghan casualties have been increasing, but they have avoided giving hard figures, apparently because of political sensitivities.\n\nIn its most recent report to Congress, in October, the special inspector general for Afghanistan said Afghan casualty numbers had been reported only in classified form since September 2017 because the U.S. military command in Kabul said it had stopped making them public at the request of the Afghan government. However, the report said that the average number of casualties between May and October this year was the greatest it has ever been during similar periods.\n\nOn Oct. 30, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Afghan forces had more than 1,000 dead and wounded during August and September alone, \u201cand they stayed in the field fighting.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has marginally increased U.S. troop numbers to train Afghan forces and intensify military pressure on the Taliban in hopes of forcing the insurgents to negotiate an end to the 17-year conflict. Successes on the battlefield have been elusive. The inspector general report said the number of districts under Afghan government control and influence has declined and stands at just 55 percent \u2014 down 16 percentage points in the past three years.\n\nU.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad is on his second tour of the region in a month, seeking to kick-start a peace process. The diplomatic veteran is making stops in Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office. The insurgents say they met Khalilzad in Qatar last month. The Taliban have so far refused direct negotiations with Kabul, which they view as a U.S. puppet.\n\nOn the sensitive topic of the U.S. role in talks, Ghani said there was \u201ctotal agreement\u201d between the U.S. and Afghan governments on moving the peace process forward.\n\n\u201cU.S. engagement is to ensure that talks with the Taliban result not in negotiations with Taliban but with talks, direct talks, between the Afghan government and the Taliban,\u201d he said.\n\nHe insisted that the Afghan government was seeking a negotiated peace but would not do so \u201cfrom a position of weakness.\u201d\n\nIn a possible sign of America\u2019s efforts, Pakistan released two Taliban officials on Monday, members of the militant group said. Abdul Samad Sani, a U.S.-designated terrorist who served as the Afghan Central Bank governor during the militants\u2019 rule in the late 1990s, and a lower-ranking commander named Salahuddin, were freed, according to two Taliban officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media.\n\nGhani, however, said Pakistan has yet to demonstrate a \u201csense of urgency\u201d in seeking an end to the Afghan conflict and a change in its policies.\n\nKabul has long protested that Afghan Taliban leaders and fighters enjoy sanctuary inside Pakistan, which Islamabad denies.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Robert Burns contributed to this report.", "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 New York City\u2019s mayor says the tragedy of Flight 587 has resulted in \u201cdeep bonds\u201d of love, friendship and respect among those left to mourn.\n\nDemocrat Bill de Blasio, speaking Monday on the crash\u2019s 17th anniversary, also said the heroism of rescuers on that day symbolizes \u201cthe good in humanity.\u201d\n\nFlight 587 was bound for the Dominican Republic when it crashed on the Rockaway Peninsula on Nov. 12, 2001.\n\nThe crash claimed 265 lives, including five victims on the ground.\n\nBelle Harbor, Queens, an enclave of police officers, firefighters and financial district workers, was still holding funerals for its 9/11 dead when Flight 587 crashed in its midst.\n\nInvestigators said the plane\u2019s tail detached after a co-pilot responding to turbulence put stress on the rudder.", "In this June 7, 1979 photo provided by Stratford Festival, Actor Douglas Rain appears as King Henry IV in this scene from The Second Part of Henry IV at Stratford's Festival Theatre in Stratford, Ontario.

(Robert C Ragsdale/Stratford Festival via AP)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Canadian actor Douglas Rain, who played some of Shakespeare\u2019s most intriguing characters onstage but perhaps is best known for supplying the creepily calm voice of the computer HAL in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d has died at 90.\n\nThe Stratford Festival said Rain died Sunday of natural causes at St. Marys Memorial Hospital, just outside of Stratford, Ontario. He was one of the festival\u2019s founding company members and spent 32 seasons performing there, until 1998.\n\nHis roles at Stratford included playing Claudio in \u201cMeasure for Measure\u201d in 1954, Malvolio in \u201cTwelfth Night\u201d in 1957, Edgar in \u201cKing Lear\u201d in 1964 and Prince Hal in \u201cHenry IV, Part 1\u2033 in 1958, a play and a role he would return to in 1965 and would eventually take on the title role in 1966.\n\nBut it was the aloof voice of the artificially intelligent HAL 9000 \u2014 the forerunner of today\u2019s Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Google Home \u2014 where Rain entered the public\u2019s consciousness. Kubrick had heard Rain\u2019s voice in the 1960 documentary \u201cUniverse,\u201d a film he watched multiple times, according to the actor. Rain was initially hired to narrate 1968\u2032s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d but the director chose to go a different direction.\n\nHAL is the onboard master computer on the spaceship Discovery 1 but goes rogue. When astronaut Dave Bowman asks HAL to open the ships\u2019 pod doors, HAL famously balks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dave. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that,\u201d the machine blandly refuses. \u201cThis mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.\u201d\n\nWhen the astronauts try to disconnect HAL, he fights back. During his shutdown, HAL sings the nursey rhyme \u201cDaisy Bell\u201d and memorably utters: \u201cI\u2019m afraid, Dave. Dave, my mind is going. I can feel it.\u201d The American Film Institute named HAL the 13th greatest movie villain of all time, joining a list that includes Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader.\n\nStratford Festival Artistic Director Antoni Cimolino called Rain one of Canada\u2019s greatest acting talents and a \u201cguiding light in its development.\u201d He said the actor\u2019s humanity shone through in HAL.\n\n\u201cDouglas shared many of the same qualities as Kubrick\u2019s iconic creation: precision, strength of steel, enigma and infinite intelligence, as well as a wicked sense of humor,\u201d Cimolino said. \u201cBut those of us lucky enough to have worked with Douglas soon solved his riddle and discovered that at the center of his mystery lay warmth and humanity, evidenced in his care for the young members of our profession.\u201d\n\nRain attended the University of Manitoba and studied in London at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. He started out performing radio plays. From 1974 to 1977, Rain was head of the English acting section of the National Theatre School of Canada.\n\nRain performed at theaters and festivals all over Canada, including the Shaw Festival, where he played such roles as Caesar in \u201cCaesar and Cleopatra\u201d in 1983. He shared stages with such luminaries as Peter Ustinov, Maggie Smith and Colm Feore. He was nominated for a Tony Award in 1972 for his role as William Cecil in \u201cVivat! Vivat! Regina!\u201d His other Broadway credits include \u201cThe Golden Age\u201d in 1963 and \u201cThe Broken Jug\u201d in 1958.\n\nRain is survived by his two sons, David and Adam, daughter Emma, granddaughter, Salima, and a daughter-in-law, Asira.", "PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) \u2014 A delay in the start of sports betting in Rhode Island is costing the state millions in expected revenue.\n\nThe state budget included $23.5 million in revenue from sports betting through June 30, assuming an Oct. 1 start. Analysts recently cut that total by $12 million because the launch has been delayed until \u201caround Thanksgiving,\u201d The Providence Journal reported .\n\nRhode Island missed out on revenue from bets that would\u2019ve occurred when the NFL season began and during the World Series. Some of the loss has been made up by an additional $7.9 million in revenue from slot machines and table games, though.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law earlier this year that made most sports gambling illegal. Rhode Island is the only New England state that has passed legislation legalizing sports betting so far.\n\nIt will be allowed at Twin River\u2019s casinos in Lincoln and Tiverton.\n\nThe state has said that negotiations with the vendor who will manage sports betting services took longer than expected. State Senate President Dominick Ruggerio said he\u2019s frustrated with the delay in the implementation.\n\nRhode Island will get 51 percent of the revenue. The vendor will get 32 percent and the casino will get 17 percent.\n\nProvidence-based IGT and its commercial partner, William Hill U.S., have a five-year agreement with the state to manage sports betting services. Their software for setting the odds and processing bets was given to the state lottery last week for testing, Rhode Island Department of Revenue spokesman Paul Grimaldi said Monday. Sports betting will begin after the testing finishes, he added.\n\nGrimaldi did not have an estimate for how lucrative the market could potentially be in the future. He said that will depend on how popular sports betting is among Rhode Islanders, whether Massachusetts and Connecticut residents travel to Rhode Island to place bets and whether tourists visiting Newport go to the Tiverton casino, which is about 30 minutes away.", "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The communities said to be favored to become homes to a pair of big, new East Coast bases for Amazon are both riverfront stretches of major metropolitan areas with ample transportation and space for workers.\n\nBut there are plenty of differences between New York\u2019s Long Island City and Crystal City in northern Virginia.\n\nSet within eyeshot of the nation\u2019s capital, Crystal City is a thicket of 1980s-era office towers trying to plug into new economic energy after thousands of federal jobs moved elsewhere.\n\nRapidly growing Long Island City is an old manufacturing area already being reinvented as a hub for 21st-century industry, creativity and urbane living.\n\nSeattle-based Amazon, which set out last year to situate one additional headquarters but now may reportedly open two, has declined to comment on its plans. But people familiar with the talks said this week that Long Island City and Crystal City have emerged as front runners for the \u201cHQ2\u201d project and its total of 50,000 jobs.\n\nA look at two communities said to be at the top of Amazon\u2019s list.\n\nLONG ISLAND CITY\n\nIt\u2019s already the fastest-developing neighborhood in the nation\u2019s most populous city, and Amazon could pump up the volume in this buzzy part of Queens.\n\nIf chosen, the neighborhood stands to burnish New York City\u2019s reputation as a tech capital. Landing Amazon would also cement Long Island City\u2019s transformation from a faded manufacturing zone to a vibrant, of-the-moment enclave of waterfront skyscrapers, modernized warehouses and artsy-tech ambience across the East River from midtown Manhattan.\n\n\u201cI joke that we\u2019re experiencing explosive growth 30 years in the making,\u201d says Elizabeth Lusskin, president of the Long Island City Partnership, a neighborhood development group.\n\nBut Long Island City also has been straining to handle its growth.\n\nDays before the potential Amazon news emerged, the city announced a $180 million plan to address Long Island City\u2019s packed schools, street design and a sewage system that groans in heavy rain. But those projects will just catch up with current needs, says area City Councilman Jimmy van Bramer.\n\n\u201cI know that there are a lot of people cheerleading for this, but HQ2 has to work for Queens and the people of Queens. It can\u2019t just be good for Amazon,\u201d says van Bramer, a Democrat.\n\nOnce a bustling factory and freight-moving area, Long Island City saw many of its plants and warehouses closed as manufacturing shriveled in New York City.\n\nThe neighborhood\u2019s rebirth began in the 1980s, when officials broached redeveloping a swath of the waterfront, while artists were drawn by warehouse spaces, affordable rents and a building that is now the MoMA PS1 museum. Silvercup Studios \u2014 where such TV shows as \u201cSex and the City,\u201d \u203330 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d have been filmed \u2014 opened in 1983.\n\nLong Island City gained a new commercial stature, and the start of a high-rise skyline, when the banking giant now called Citi opened an office tower there in 1989. But the area\u2019s growth lately has been driven by residential building.\n\nSome 9,150 new apartments and homes have been built since 2010, more than in any other New York City neighborhood, according to the city Planning Department . Thousands more units are in the works.\n\nNew York has striven for nearly a decade to position itself as a tech hotspot.\n\nVenture capitalists poured $5.8 billion into New York-area startups last quarter, more than any other region except the San Francisco area, according to the consulting and accounting firm PwC . Established tech giants, including Google and Facebook, have been expanding their New York footprints.\n\nStill, landing HQ2 would represent \u201cincredible validation of just how far New York has come,\u201d says Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the Center for an Urban Future think tank.\n\nWaiting for a subway, Long Island City community board chairwoman Denise Keehan-Smith could envision Amazon benefiting the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cBut I think we have to be careful about it,\u201d she said.\n\nCRYSTAL CITY\n\nIf any place in America can absorb 25,000 Amazon jobs without disruption, it may well be Crystal City, Virginia, where nearly that many jobs have vanished over the last 15 years.\n\nThe neighborhood in Arlington County is bounded by the Potomac River and the nation\u2019s capital on one side, by the Pentagon on another and Reagan National Airport on a third.\n\nDespite its prime location and abundant transportation options, the neighborhood has been hit by a massive outflow of jobs. The Patent and Trademark Office began moving more than 7,000 jobs out of Crystal City in 2003. In 2005, the Defense Department announced plans to move roughly 17,000 jobs elsewhere as part of a base realignment.\n\nArlington County has worked hard to bring in new employers, and had some success. The Public Broadcasting Service moved its headquarters to Crystal City in 2006.\n\nStill, large swaths of the neighborhood remain vacant. Among other challenges, the area has fought to overcome a reputation for outdated architecture.\n\nCrystal City is populated by \u201970s and \u201980s-era office buildings. The buildings are connected by a network of tunnels populated with food-court style dining options, hair salons and newsstands. The tunnels leave the ground-level outdoor streetscape sometimes looking empty.\n\nBrookings Institution urban planner Jenny Schuetz suggested the buildings may require an upgrade, or even replacement. But she noted that while people often associate tech companies with converted lofts or state-of-the art workspaces, many big Silicon Valley tech companies actually work out of \u201980s-era office buildings.\n\nFor all the talk about antiquated architecture, people who\u2019ve actually worked in Crystal City appreciate its convenience and its worker-friendly features, including the tunnels.\n\n\u201cI loved it here,\u201d said Christine Gentry of Greenbelt, Maryland, as she ate breakfast in a largely empty food court. She works for the Patent and Trademark Office and preferred the days when her office was in Crystal City.\n\n\u201cEverything is accessible here,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it was raining or snowing or sleeting, I never had to go out.\u201d\n\nPerhaps no place better illustrates the vibe of Crystal City than the region\u2019s only revolving restaurant, the Skydome atop the Doubletree Crystal City. Diners enjoy a panoramic view of the D.C. skyline, completing a full rotation every 47 minutes.\n\nSam Getachew, the hotel\u2019s food and beverage manager, said the restaurant fits the neighborhood\u2019s retro atmosphere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge draw,\u201d Getachew said. \u201cPeople come for the curiosity of it.\u201d\n\nThe only downside, he said, is that \u201cwhen customers get up to go to the restroom, they don\u2019t know where they are when they come back.\u201d\n\n___\n\nBarakat reported from Crystal City, Virginia.", "FILE - In this Nov 6, 2018 file photo, U.S. Congressman Jason Lewis gave his concession speech at the Republican Party of Minnesota headquarters in Bloomington, Minn.

She will serve until the special election is resolved.\n\nEspy in 1986 became the first African-American since Reconstruction to win a U.S. House seat in Mississippi, and if he defeats Hyde-Smith, he would be the first African-American since Reconstruction to represent the state in the U.S. Senate.\n\nHyde-Smith, who is endorsed by President Donald Trump, is the first woman to represent Mississippi in either chamber of Congress, and after being appointed is trying to become the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from the state.\n\nLamar White Jr., publisher of a left-leaning Louisiana news site called The Bayou Brief, posted the video Sunday on social media.

Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests.\u201d\n\nThe death toll from the wildfire that incinerated the Northern California town of Paradise and surrounding areas climbed to 42, making it the single deadliest single blaze in California history. Statewide, the number of fire dead stood at 44, including two victims in Southern California.\n\nThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2018\n\nOne reason that scientists know that management isn\u2019t to blame is that some areas now burning had fires in 2005 and 2008, so they aren\u2019t \u201cfuel-choked closed-canopy forests,\u201d Dennison said.\n\nIn those earlier fires, Paradise was threatened but escaped major damage, he said. In the current blazes, it was virtually destroyed.\n\nThe other major fire, in Southern California, burned through shrub land, not forest, Dennison said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about forest management. These aren\u2019t forests,\u201d he said.\n\nThe dean of the University of Michigan\u2019s environmental school, Jonathan Overpeck, said Western fires are getting bigger and more severe. He said it \u201cis much less due to bad management and is instead the result of our baking of our forests, woodlands and grasslands with ever-worsening climate change.\u201d\n\nWildfires have become more devastating because of the extreme weather swings from global warming, fire scientists said. The average number of U.S. acres burned by wildfires has doubled over the level from 30 years ago.\n\nAs of Monday, more than 13,200 square miles (34,200 square kilometers) have burned. That\u2019s more than a third higher than the 10-year average.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1999, the United States didn\u2019t reach 10,000 square miles burned annually. Since then, 11 of 19 years have had more than 10,000 square miles burned, including this year. In 2006, 2015 and 2017, more than 15,000 square miles burned.\n\nThe two fires now burning \u201caren\u2019t that far out of line with the fires we\u2019ve seen in these areas in recent decades,\u201d Dennison said.\n\n\u201cThe biggest factor was wind,\u201d Dennison said in an email. \u201cWith wind speeds as high as they were, there was nothing firefighters could do to stop the advance of the fires.\u201d\n\nThese winds, called Santa Ana winds, and the unique geography of high mountains and deep valleys act like chimneys, fortifying the fires, Thornicke said.\n\nThe wind is so strong that fire breaks \u2014 areas where trees and brush have been cleared or intentionally burned to deprive the advancing flames of fuel \u2014 won\u2019t work. One of the fires jumped over eight lanes of freeway, about 140 feet (43 meters), Dennison said.\n\nSouthern California had fires similar to the Woolsey fire in 1982, when winds were 60 mph, but \u201cthe difference between 1982 and today is a much higher population in these areas. Many more people were threatened and had to evacuated,\u201d Dennison said.\n\nCalifornia also has been in drought for all but a few years of the 21st century and is now experiencing its longest drought, which began on Dec. 27, 2011, and has lasted 358 weeks, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor . Nearly two-thirds of the state is abnormally dry.\n\nThe first nine months of the year have been fourth-warmest on record for California, and this past summer was the second-hottest on record in the state.\n\nBecause of that, there are 129 million dead trees, which provide fuel for fires, Thornicke said.\n\nAnd it\u2019s more than trees. Dead shrubs around the bottom of trees provide what is called \u201cladder fuel,\u201d offering a path for fire to climb from the ground to the treetops and intensifying the conflagration by a factor of 10 to 100, said Kevin Ryan, a fire consultant and former fire scientist at the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nWhile many conservatives advocate cutting down more trees to prevent fires, no one makes money by cutting dead shrubs, and that\u2019s a problem, he said.\n\nLocal and state officials have cleared some Southern California shrub, enough for normal weather and winds. But that\u2019s not enough for this type of extreme drought, said Ryan, also a former firefighter.\n\nUniversity of Alberta fire scientist Mike Flanigan earlier this year told The Associated Press that the hotter and drier the weather, the easier it is for fires to start, spread and burn more intensely.\n\nIt\u2019s simple, he said: \u201cThe warmer it is, the more fire we see.\u201d\n\nFor every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit that the air warms, it needs 15 percent more rain to make up for the drying of the fuel, Flannigan said.\n\nFederal fire and weather data show the years with the most acres burned were generally a degree warmer than average.\n\n\u201cEveryone who has gardened knows that you must water more on hotter days,\u201d Overpeck said. \u201cBut, thanks in part to climate change, California isn\u2019t getting enough snow and rain to compensate for the unrelenting warming caused by climate change. The result is a worsening wildfire problem.\n\n___\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

(AP Photo/Steve Yeater)\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 Jimmy Butler is in Philadelphia, and upon his arrival he immediately began talking about winning a championship.\n\n\u201cThe Process\u201d has a whole new meaning.\n\nButler, a four-time All-Star forward, is now officially a member of the 76ers, after they and the Minnesota Timberwolves received approval from the league office Monday on the terms of the trade that was agreed to over the weekend.\n\n\u201cHe replicates, he mirrors, the spirit of Philadelphia,\u201d 76ers coach Brett Brown said. \u201cHe is a fierce competitor. And there is a toughness that he plays with. That\u2019s who he is. And he wears it on his face, it\u2019s seen in his game, it\u2019s confirmed by multiple all-defensive teams and it\u2019s a perfect fit for the city and our program defensively.\u201d\n\nThe deal gives Philadelphia a legitimate \u201cBig Three,\u201d with Butler joining All-Star forward Joel Embiid and reigning rookie of the year Ben Simmons on a team that already was expected to be a major Eastern Conference contender this season. Butler flew into Philadelphia on Monday and told NBC Sports Philadelphia that fans should expect \u201ca guy who wants to win.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want a championship,\u201d Butler said as he signed a couple of autographs before he was driven away from the airport. \u201cAnd I think the core group of guys that we have will figure out a way to get it done.\u201d\n\nButler and Justin Patton were traded to Philadelphia for Robert Covington, Dario Saric and Jerryd Bayless, along with a 2022 second-round draft pick.\n\nButler will be introduced by the 76ers on Tuesday and is expected to debut with his new club Wednesday at Orlando. Philadelphia was playing at Miami on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe have a championship window that\u2019s centered around the continued progression of our talented young core, as well as our ability to add elite players who elevate our program,\u201d 76ers general manager Elton Brand said. \u201cIn Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, we have two of the NBA\u2019s top 20 players. Now, we\u2019ve added a third top-20 player in Jimmy Butler.\u201d\n\nThe 76ers won 47 games in a three-season span between 2013 and 2016. They won 28 in 2016-17, made the jump to the playoffs at 52-30 last season and now will be considered an even more serious threat to emerge as the East representative in the NBA Finals.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge is piecing all this together,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even close. ... I say that completely from an excitement standpoint. This isn\u2019t a burden. Sure, it\u2019s a responsibility. But I\u2019m excited with piecing this together.\u201d\n\nButler has averaged 21.8 points per game since the start of the 2014-15 season, the 13th-highest clip in the NBA over that span.\n\nThere are three teams with multiple current teammates averaging at least that many points over those seasons. Golden State has three such players, with Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and DeMarcus Cousins, though Cousins hasn\u2019t played yet this season for the Warriors while recovering from surgery.\n\nOklahoma City teammates Russell Westbrook and Paul George also have averaged that much \u2014 and now, Philly has such a pairing in Butler and Embiid.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s going to bring toughness, scoring ability, a veteran,\u201d 76ers guard Markelle Fultz said. \u201cJust going to compete on both ends of the floor and I hope he pushes this team to a higher level.\u201d\n\nButler is the obvious headliner to this trade, though there will be some adjustments for the 76ers to make now that the deal is finally done.\n\nSaric and Covington were key players for Philadelphia, combining to make 398 starts including playoffs for the 76ers during their time with the club. Saric averaged 13.5 points with the 76ers over parts of three seasons, while Covington averaged 12.9 points during his five seasons with Philly. They were the starting forwards for the 76ers in nearly every game last season, when Philadelphia had its best record since 2000-01 \u2014 the last time that the franchise went to the NBA Finals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to have these guys come in,\u201d Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. \u201cWith Robert and Dario, that they\u2019ve started on a good team, they\u2019ll help.\u201d\n\nThe deal between the teams was struck on Saturday, though it couldn\u2019t become official until the trade call Monday.\n\nIt ends a two-month saga during which there was no doubt that Butler was going to get traded out of Minnesota. He told the Timberwolves shortly before training camp that he wanted to be moved, which forced Minnesota\u2019s hand because it was obvious that Butler would not re-sign next summer. So the options were to move him for something, or lose him for nothing.\n\n\u201cHe loves to win,\u201d Fultz said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do whatever it takes to win.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "FILE - In this Friday, Nov. 9, 2018, file photo, Minnesota head coach Lindsay Whalen watches as guard Jasmine Brunson (21) brings the ball up against New Hampshire during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game in Minneapolis.

The novel medication developed in the Netherlands was flown to Oahu from Italy with a tight expiration date.\n\n\u201cI was excited and I feel great,\u201d Bona said in September, following the hourlong procedure.\n\nBona was the first patient in Hawaii to undergo the procedure at The Queen\u2019s Medical Center in Honolulu.\n\nFollowing the treatment, she was \u201cradioactive\u201d and placed in isolation for about six hours while taking a special formula of amino acids to protect other areas of her body from the radiation.

Only one grave marker is still at the cemetery, and it belongs to Henry Mitchell, who died in 1905. The others have all been removed or crumbled.\n\nRupert resident Lynn Porter owns a cold-case assistance business called Semper Vigilans, which provides forensic archaeology and other services. She\u2019s used the cemetery as a training ground for her human cadaver-sniffing dogs.\n\nShe and other dog handlers are using their findings to make a map of the remaining gravesites.\n\n\u201cI love history and I like helping people,\u201d said Porter, who doesn\u2019t charge for her services. \u201cIt also gives my dogs a chance to keep their skills sharp.\u201d\n\nWhen Porter signed up for a historical grave class with Paul Martin, a forensic archaeologist from Tennessee, a group of nine dog handlers spent Sept. 29 and 30 at the Minidoka cemetery using their dogs and ground penetrating radar to map remains. The handlers came from northern Idaho, Arizona, California and Colorado.\n\nAll of the information they gleaned was marked with GPS coordinates and will be used to make the map, Porter said. The cemetery has hardpan at 30 inches, according to a study of the soil density, so the bodies were likely buried in shallow graves.\n\nResearch also confirmed the name of one other person buried at the cemetery, who died in 1928, Porter said.\n\nThe remains detected were \u201csomewhat scattered,\u201d she said.\n\nMinidoka Mayor Jim Cook was born just a few miles from the cemetery.

How did we get to this place?\n\nIt seems the term \u201cstatesmanship\u201d has been abandoned, and it\u2019s all about winning, not serving.\n\nPolitics is not a game; why is it that our elected leaders treat it like one? When all you think about is winning, you lose sight of reason.\n\nWe realize that compromise does take place in the halls of government and that some of our representatives really do reach across the aisle and work for the greater good.\n\nUnfortunately, these aren\u2019t the stories we see, and it\u2019s certainly not the rhetoric we hear.\n\nMaybe President Rutherford B. Hayes said it best in his inaugural address in 1877: \u201d... we ought not to be, in a partisan sense, either Republicans or Democrats, but fellow citizens and fellowmen, to whom the interests of a common country and a common humanity are dear.\u201d\n\nHayes was right.\n\nIt\u2019s time for politicians to put aside this juvenile mentality of \u201crefusing to compromise\u201d and be adults about their jobs. And that means talking to \u2014 and listening to\u2014 the other side, working to find common ground and being mature enough to embrace compromise.\n\nIt\u2019s the only way out of the mess we\u2019re in.\n\n___\n\nLa Crosse Tribune, Nov. 11\n\nWestern Wisconsin has plenty to offer our new governor\n\nWisconsin Gov.-elect Tony Evers certainly has a long list of issues to work on.\n\nThe list is not just long, it\u2019s daunting, from equitable education funding to road improvements and expanded broadband; from protecting our natural resources and determining the best course for health care funding.\n\nThis is the first time that control of Wisconsin\u2019s government has been divided for a full legislative session in a decade. And talk of a lame-duck legislative session to curb the powers of the governor before Democrat Evers takes office is more than lame. It\u2019s an embarrassing power grab by people far more interested in political preservation than principle.\n\nWith all that to navigate, we have a suggestion \u2014 one of many Tony Evers is already no doubt receiving.\n\nListen to Wisconsin voices outside of Milwaukee and Madison.\n\nSpeaking parochially, we hope the new governor is much more inclusive to western Wisconsin on boards and commissions that help shape policy and direction in our state.\n\nAs a former teacher and principal in Tomah, Evers certainly understands the need for a rural voice.\n\nWhile big electoral wins in Madison and Milwaukee had a lot to do with the governor\u2019s election Tuesday, he\u2019ll be governor of all of Wisconsin \u2014 rural, urban, west, east.\n\n(For the record, Evers won 56 percent of the vote in La Crosse County with an amazing turnout of more than 85 percent of registered voters.)\n\nIn her book, \u201cThe Politics of Resentment:\u201d Rural Consciousness and the Rise of Scott Walker,\u201d University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor Katherine J. Cramer went to rural areas throughout the state and listened much more than talked.\n\nShe heard loud and clear the resentment of many who live in small towns and rural areas.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons that getting more voices from throughout the state is bound to provide more diverse feedback on such issues as education funding and rural infrastructure.\n\nAs superintendent of public instruction, Evers has been a longtime ex-officio member of the UW Board of Regents, and he can certainly appreciate the importance of understanding the network of campuses and their specialties and contributions to their regions and beyond.\n\nAs we have repeatedly editorialized, the La Crosse area \u2014 with arguably the top comprehensive campus in the UW System \u2014 has been without a member of the Board of Regents for several years while other areas are represented by multiple members. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s equitable or wise, and we hope that\u2019s something that Gov. Evers moves quickly to fix.\n\nAs we head toward the 2020 census and the need for redistricting, we hope the new governor pushes for an independent redistricting commission, like Iowa has used since the 1980s.\n\nWhen you look at some of the Assembly Districts in western Wisconsin, you understand the confusion caused by splitting a rural county into multiple legislative districts.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before, voters should pick their representatives, not the other way around.\n\nRemember that Tommy Thompson had a great deal of success working in a split statehouse.\n\nHe used a lot of charisma, charm and collaboration \u2014 and an incredible love of Wisconsin.\n\nIt truly can happen again in Madison.\n\nIn fact, it needs to.\n\nBut the foundation should come from people who live throughout our great state.", "FILE - In this July 26, 2018, file photo, Cincinnati Bengals defensive coordinator Teryl Austin participates during NFL football practice, in Cincinnati.

New Orleans scored on every possession except the last one \u2014 when it took a knee while in field-goal range \u2014 during its rout at Paul Brown Stadium.\n\nThe fading Bengals (5-4) fired a coordinator in midstream for the second season in a row. And it\u2019s up to Lewis to get hands-on and try to fix the mess while filling two roles at once.\n\n\u201cTeryl worked very hard, but I just felt like we have to rock their world, shake things up,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nThe timing was curious. The Bengals were coming off their bye week that would have given them time to adapt to a change at coordinator. Now, they\u2019re changing on the fly while getting ready for a pivotal AFC North game at Baltimore (4-5) on Sunday.\n\nLewis made another interesting move, re-hiring fired Browns coach Hue Jackson, who served as his offensive coordinator in 2014 and 2015. Jackson, who was dismissed by Cleveland on Oct. 29 after winning just three games in two-plus seasons, will take on an unspecified role within Lewis\u2019 staff, a person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press on Monday night.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team has not announced Jackson\u2019s addition.\n\nThe Bengals host the Browns on Nov. 25.\n\nLewis took the defense aside a few times on Sunday, trying to clear up confusion.

In the past four games, Cincinnati has allowed 481, 551, 576 and 509 yards.\n\nLewis has one thing in his favor: The schedule is far more favorable the rest of the way.\n\nCincinnati has faced six offenses currently ranked in the league\u2019s Top 10 \u2014 Tampa Bay (No. 1), Kansas City (3), Pittsburgh (4), New Orleans (5), Atlanta (6) and Indianapolis (9). Only two are left on the schedule: the Chargers (8) and the Steelers again.\n\nWith three losses in the past four games, Cincinnati has fallen from first place to trailing Pittsburgh (6-2-1) by two games in the loss column. They can\u2019t afford to fall any further behind, which was a factor in the firing.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to get things fixed now,\u201d defensive end Carlos Dunlap said. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t paying attention, you\u2019re paying attention now.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the second time during his 16-season tenure in Cincinnati that Lewis has gotten directly involved in the defense.\n\nThe Bengals hired him in 2003 in large part because of his reputation for defensive coaching \u2014 he coordinated the Ravens\u2019 Super Bowl-championship defense in the 2000 season. Defense has been a regular challenge during his tenure.\n\nLewis became so frustrated with the defense in 2004 that he took over play-calling from coordinator Leslie Frazier during a game against Cleveland. The Bengals lost 34-17 and Lewis left the defense in Frazier\u2019s hands the rest of the way, and then fired him after the season.\n\nNow, he\u2019s back in charge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not playing well, so something had to change,\u201d safety Jessie Bates said.\n\nLewis hired Austin from Detroit after defensive coordinator Paul Guenther left to join Jon Gruden with the Raiders. The Bengals gave up a lot of yards while opening the season 4-1, with the defense scoring four touchdowns off fumble and interception returns to overcome the poor showings overall.\n\nWith injuries sapping the defense during a stretch of games against the NFL\u2019s top offenses, the unit imploded. The Saints scored touchdowns on all five first-half possessions Sunday, and moved the ball easily even when they were running out the clock in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Bengals matched the club record by giving up 28 points in the second quarter. The 51 points allowed were one shy of the club record.\n\nAustin is the fourth coordinator fired in the NFL this season. Tampa Bay fired defensive coordinator Mike Smith, Arizona fired offensive coordinator Mike McCoy, and the Browns fired head coach Hue Jackson and offensive coordinator Todd Haley.\n\nJackson has a close relationship with Lewis, who has declined to discuss whether he\u2019d bring him back to Cincinnati. Jackson coached on both offense and defense in Cincinnati.\n\nLast year, the Bengals fired offensive coordinator Ken Zampese after an 0-2 start, but the Bengals missed out on the playoffs for the second year in a row. Lewis got a two-year contract extension after the season even though he\u2019s 0-7 in the playoffs \u2014 an NFL record for futility.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Tom Withers in Cleveland contributed to this report.", "SAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 Authorities have arrested a man for investigation of arson in a San Diego County brush fire that destroyed a building and threatened numerous homes.\n\nSan Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Sgt.

So she looked elsewhere.\n\n\u201cEveryone that was helping me was men,\u201d she said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cMen like John Chaney, John Thompson, Nolan Richardson took me under their wing. I had so much respect for them that I was able to learn and they were kind enough to teach.\u201d\n\nWhile grateful for their help, she wanted to make sure other black female coaches would have someone they could go to. Over her Hall of Fame career, she has been a role model for dozens of them, including South Carolina\u2019s Dawn Staley.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the things Stringer is most proud of as she sits one victory away from becoming the fifth Division I women\u2019s basketball coach to reach 1,000 victories. She\u2019ll get her first chance to join the exclusive club Tuesday night against Central Connecticut State.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to make a positive impact,\u201d the 70-year-old Stringer said. \u201cAnything I can give them in any way. The way I might handle something, or the technical aspect of it. I want to set the best example I can for them.\u201d\n\nWhether it\u2019s a friendly word or piece of advice out on the recruiting trail or a phone call, Stringer has made a difference.\n\n\u201cCoach Stringer represents hope for us,\u201d said Staley, who in 2017 became the second African-American coach to win a women\u2019s national championship. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t won a national championship, but she\u2019s gotten to the Final Four with three different schools. That\u2019s historical for us. She seized the opportunity to be successful wherever she went and she gave us an example of how to succeed with whatever opportunity you were given.\u201d\n\nStaley and Stringer\u2019s relationship goes back to when Stringer tried to recruit the Philadelphia point guard to Iowa. Stringer was late to recruit Staley, who was set to attend to Virginia. Still, Staley felt bad when she had to tell the coach she was going elsewhere.\n\n\u201cShe actually made me cry,\u201d Staley recalled. \u201cI don\u2019t think she meant to put the guilt trip on me, you just hate to say no to her.\u201d\n\nStaley also recalled that Stringer\u2019s Rutgers team was the first Top 25 team in the country to come play Temple when she was coaching there.\n\n\u201cCoach Stringer was the first to give us an opportunity,\u201d Staley said. \u201cShe had nothing to gain by it besides making women\u2019s basketball better by giving someone like Temple an opportunity to better ourselves.\u201d\n\nLike Staley, Cincinnati coach Michelle Clark-Heard also was recruited by Stringer to go to Iowa. She, too, went elsewhere, but has cherished knowing Stringer.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of us in that position,\u201d Clark-Heard said of African-American coaches. \u201cSeeing her on the road and how she always is with everyone. She was one of the first to stop me when I had my first Division I head coaching job at Western Kentucky. She\u2019s a phenomenal role model. As an African-American female coach she\u2019s someone that I look up to.\u201d\n\nWhen Stringer gets her next victory, she\u2019ll join Pat Summitt, Geno Auriemma, Tara VanDerveer and Sylvia Hatchell with 1,000 wins. Division II coach Barbara Stevens of Bentley also has reached the milestone. She\u2019ll be the first African-American coach to reach that mark.\n\nStringer laughs when she thinks about her start at Cheyney in 1972. She can\u2019t remember her first basketball victory. She had no idea she\u2019d still be coaching nearly five decades later with a chance to reach 1,000 wins.\n\nWhile details of the first victory escape her, she remembers it took her five tries to get her 900th back in 2013 \u2014 a feat she hopes doesn\u2019t repeat itself.\n\n\u201cI just want to get it over with,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best way for me to say that. I think that\u2019s what happened with 900, they were trying so hard to do it, you\u2019d think it was the first game we played. They were really nervous to get it done.\u201d\n\nStringer will have numerous family members, friends, former players and coaches in attendance on Tuesday and many more watching from afar.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s special for me and I recognize the impact I have had,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cI can stand off to the side and look at them and see the young ladies coaching. The fact that I\u2019ve made a difference is something I won\u2019t forget.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg", "", "", "METAIRIE, La.

But Duke now has 48 first-place votes, claiming the top spot for all 19 voters who had Kentucky as preseason No. 1 while also causing 23 voters to switch from Kansas in the preseason Duke this week.\n\nDuke also prompted switches from the lone voters who had Gonzaga and Villanova at No. 1 in the preseason.\n\nThe hype probably won\u2019t slow anytime soon, either. The Blue Devils have everyone\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cPart of becoming good is keeping the noise out of your locker room,\u201d Krzyzewski said after the Army win. \u201cAnd when something good happens and you have the start of the season ... there\u2019s a lot of noise. And for us, it\u2019s not always good noise, but in this case, it was exceptional noise. Exceptional noise.\n\n\u201cWhen you have four freshmen and we don\u2019t have veterans, you have to be more mature about listening to that.\u201d\n\nAT THE TOP\n\nGonzaga stayed at No. 3, followed by Virginia and Tennessee each climbing a spot to round out the top 5. Nevada, North Carolina, reigning national champion Villanova and Auburn were next, while Kentucky slid eight spots to No. 10.\n\nTOP RISERS\n\nThere weren\u2019t any dramatic climbs beyond the Duke-Kansas change at the top. In all, 16 teams moved up this week poll, with No. 14 Florida State and No. 19 Clemson matching Duke\u2019s three-spot jump for the biggest of the week.\n\nTwelve of the gains were merely one spot.\n\nLONGEST SLIDES\n\nKentucky\u2019s fall was the biggest for any team that stayed in the poll. The others were all modest, with four teams \u2014 Kansas, No. 11 Michigan State, No. 16 Virginia Tech and No. 21 TCU \u2014 falling one spot each.\n\nNEWCOMERS\n\nThere were two new teams in the poll with No. 24 Marquette and No. 25 Buffalo.\n\nIt\u2019s the first appearance for Marquette in nearly five years since last appearing at No. 25 in November 2013.\n\nAs for Buffalo, it\u2019s the first AP Top 25 appearance in program history. It comes after the Bulls got 43 points and 14 rebounds from CJ Massinburg to beat then-No. 13 West Virginia on the road \u2014 another marquee upset for a team that beat Arizona and eventual No. 1 overall NBA draft pick Deandre Ayton in the first round of last year\u2019s NCAA Tournament.\n\nSLIDING OUT\n\nThe Mountaineers slid all the way out after losing to the Bulls, which marked their first loss in a home opener since November 2003.

But don\u2019t forget the basics: health care, economy, etc.\n\nDemocrats ride into the U.S. House with a strong, new majority and, for many of them, decisive wins that affirm their agendas.\n\nAnd they\u2019re not waiting until January to make their presence felt. Incoming House chairs have served notice to acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker that they intend to protect special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. That kind of vigorous check on executive power is needed and should move ahead. But it would be a mistake for Democrats to become consumed by efforts to take down this president and unleash a blizzard of investigations and impeachment proceedings.\n\nVoters want accountability, but that was not the issue uppermost in the minds of those who sent a new majority to the House. Rather, exit polls, interviews and candidates themselves all told the same story: It\u2019s health care, stupid. America has awakened to the fact that an estimated 1 in 3 of us have a pre-existing condition and that the time for the other two is most likely coming.\n\nIt\u2019s also an economy that, for all its good points, has left too many behind with jobs that pay too little for them to raise a family, educate their children and save for retirement. It\u2019s an education system that has saddled a generation with soaring student loan debt, as they attempt to pursue better-paying jobs and careers. It\u2019s an outdated immigration system and the refusal to deal meaningfully with gun violence.\n\nAmericans are frustrated by politicians who get caught up in distractions, who scapegoat others as a way of ducking hard choices. Yes, this country is deeply polarized, a condition made worse by those who actively foster that division instead of reminding citizens of all that binds them together as one nation.\n\nBut the citizens themselves have not forgotten. The cultural wars are old and tired, and while they raged, many fell further and further behind. The reality is that many Americans want the same things: reliable and affordable health care, good schools that lead to well-paying jobs in all walks; decent housing in safe neighborhoods; living wages; good roads and transit; and, finally, the path to a comfortable retirement. Democrats and Republicans will have different visions of how to get there, but both sides should recognize that Americans are hungry for leaders who will focus on what\u2019s important to them in their everyday lives.\n\nWhether she is able to stay this course or not, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi struck the right note on election night, when she said the incoming House majority would work on those bread-and-butter issues, and \u201cwe will strive for bipartisanship with fairness on all sides. We have a responsibility to find common ground where we can. We have a bipartisan marketplace of ideas that make our democracy strong. We will work on solutions that bring us together because we have all had enough of division. The American people want peace. They want results.\u201d\n\nIn the Republican Senate, in which the GOP widened its majority, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, offered a similar conciliatory outlook. Earlier threats to cut Social Security and Medicare are now deemed \u201cunlikely,\u201d and he is talking about the need to \u201cfix\u201d the Affordable Care Act rather than scrap it outright. New tax legislation, he acknowledges, will require bipartisan support \u2014 a recognition of the fact that tax bills must originate in the House, giving Democrats control of that terrain.\n\nDivided government can work \u2014 and work well \u2014 when both sides are committed to finding common ground and recognizing the need for genuine compromise rather than waging all-out war on the other side. If President Donald Trump continues to feed on division, that spirit will be needed more than ever.\n\nAmericans \u2014 and Minnesotans __will have to do their part by praising compromise where it occurs and rejecting the pugnacious, all-or-nothing stance that has done so much to corrode public life.\n\n___\n\nPost Bulletin, Nov. 7\n\nAfter bitter election, let us have peace\n\nLet us have peace.\n\nElections in America, like the one completed with Tuesday\u2019s voting, have come to resemble uncivil wars.\n\nNeighbors are pitted against neighbors, communities are divided, family members tiptoe around politics at holiday gatherings, and a nation struggles, without much guidance, for a way to heal.\n\nNow the campaign is over, the votes have been cast, it\u2019s safe to once again go to your mailbox without fear of finding yet another mean-spirited political mailer; you can again watch your favorite television program without being bombarded with commercials making ugly charges against this or that candidate.\n\nAfter this latest uncivil war we turn to the wisdom of a man who helped win the Civil War and wanted to heal the nation. Upon accepting the 1868 nomination for president, Ulysses S. Grant said, \u201cLet us have peace.\u201d\n\nBut can we bridge the gulf that separates us? Is there even a will? Can we rediscover civility? Are there, among those elected to office Tuesday, leaders who have the desire to help us along that path?\n\nIn a nation so starkly and evenly divided, it is certain that nearly one-half the electorate woke up today in bitter despair at Tuesday\u2019s results. The other half are rejoicing.\n\nThose emotions, however honest, cannot obscure what has to come next. There are problems that won\u2019t solve themselves. There are communities, and a nation, that need to be brought together.\n\nWe have sensed in recent months a desire on the part of citizens to at a minimum tone down the constant conflict. It is, after all, exhausting to live in a society riven by, not just disagreements, but outright disrespect for each other.\n\nWe predict that, among Tuesday\u2019s elected candidates, those who appeal to that desire, who are able to harness positive rather than negative energy, will win more than just an election. They will win the gratitude of their fellow citizens.\n\nIf they can\u2019t, or don\u2019t want to unite us, then we, the people, will have to do it ourselves. It has to start one-on-one, neighbor-to-neighbor. We need to listen to each other, give credence to opinions, and honor differences.\n\nIt\u2019s up to us. We can heal the society. We can harness its energy and potential to serve the greater good. Or we can stubbornly cling to our bitterness and divisions.\n\nWe believe there is no other choice after this most recent uncivil war. Let us demand, and have, peace.\n\n___\n\nThe Free Press of Mankato, Nov. 12\n\nGuns: DFL should take aim to secure public safety\n\nWhy it matters: GOP leaders in the Legislature last year were so beholden to the gun industry they refused to have hearings on gun safety.\n\nWith mass shootings on the rise last year, the GOP-controlled state House of Representatives shut down hearings on things like background checks and taking guns from domestic abusers.\n\nThe GOP-controlled Senate refused to hold hearings on common-sense gun measures offered by members of its own caucus. It turned off the microphone on a young person who appeared spontaneously and wanted to speak about his fear of guns in schools. The GOP House speaker vowed allegiance to the NRA, telling reporters they would pass no gun laws that didn\u2019t have the NRA stamp of approval.\n\nWell, times have changed, and Minnesotans will be safer for that.\n\nNew DFL House Speaker Melissa Hortmann, of Brooklyn Park, has vowed to attack the gun issues right away. She notes the double digit gains in House seats, mostly from the Twin Cities suburbs, was a response from those constituents wanting some common-sense gun legislation.\n\nMankato\u2019s Rep. Jack Considine will also likely figure to be a significant factor in the debate as a member of the House Public Safety committee and quite possibly its incoming chairman, though that decision has yet to be made.\n\nConsidine offered last year the obvious legislation to ban \u201cbump stocks,\u201d those attachments that can make a regular gun act like a machine gun. One was used by the Las Vegas killer, who fired 1,000 rounds to kill 58 people.\n\nConsidine\u2019s bill did not receive a hearing in the Republican-controlled committee.\n\nThe House committee also ignored bills to expand background checks to gun shows and online sales. It also rejected hearings on \u201cred flag\u201d laws that would allow judges to decide if guns should be taken from people deemed dangerous to themselves and others.\n\nThose bills will all get a fair hearing in the DFL-controlled House.

Maybe it hasn\u2019t hit them in their homes yet.\u201d\n\nFor educators who ran for office in states including Kentucky, Arizona and West Virginia that saw teachers converge on capitols this year, there were some successes but also disappointments. Still, advocates say, the movement will have lasting effects after pushing education onto the agenda of many midterm campaigns.\n\nMany candidates who won held themselves out as champions of public education, and the teachers union will be watching to ensure they live up to their pledges, said Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association.\n\n\u201cPromises were made to the public about commitments to those public school students, and we will be keeping score on who was for kids and who was just kidding, and that is going to make a huge difference in 2020,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvocates pointed to bright spots in the election results.\n\nWisconsin state schools Superintendent Tony Evers ousted Gov. Scott Walker, on whose watch teachers and other public workers lost nearly all collective bargaining power. Connecticut elected 2016 National Teacher of the Year Jahana Hayes to Congress. Democrat Tim Walz, who spent 20 years teaching and coaching high school, won the Minnesota governor\u2019s race, and math teacher Julie Blaha, a Democrat, was elected that state\u2019s auditor.\n\nSpeech pathologist Kathy Hoffman, a Democrat, declared victory Sunday over Republican Frank Riggs in the race to become Arizona\u2019s superintendent of public instruction, though the race remained too close to officially call, and four school principals or administrators were elected to the Oklahoma House.\n\nAlso, Arizona voters rejected a Republican-backed measure to expand the state\u2019s private school vouchers program, criticized as a move to drain money from public schools. And several funding measures passed, including a $500 million bond for school safety and water infrastructure in New Jersey and a constitutional amendment in Maryland to require casino revenue be set aside for schools.\n\nThe #RedforEd protests, in which teachers clad in red shirts converged on statehouses in conservative states including Oklahoma, had raised hopes of a groundswell of support for candidates who favored increased education spending and teachers who were inspired to run themselves.\n\nNationwide, polls showed education was not any more of a priority for most voters than in previous years, according to Rick Hess, director of education policy studies at American Enterprise Institute.\n\n\u201cWe were awestruck by the energy and the passion that arose in spring. We were awestruck by how successful the teachers were in states like West Virginia, and Oklahoma and Arizona, but if you look simply at the data in terms of what voters were thinking about and saying was a big issue going into the voting booth, there\u2019s little evidence education played a big role,\u201d Hess said Friday during an Educators Writer Association panel discussion at the National Press Club in Washington.\n\nIn West Virginia, where the national movement began with a statewide teachers\u2019 strike in February, teacher Cody Thompson, a Democrat, was elected as a state legislator Tuesday, but at least four other current or retired teachers lost House races. Still, teachers unions declared victory in the ouster of Republican majority leaders they had opposed in the House and Senate.\n\nIn Kentucky, teachers rallied against the Republican-dominated legislature for passing bills allowing charter schools and making changes to the state\u2019s retirement system.

Two-thirds of them lost.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said, \u201cpeople are not as concerned about the future of public education as we might have thought they were. Maybe it hasn\u2019t hit them in their homes yet.\u201d\n\nFor educators who ran for office in states including Kentucky, Arizona and West Virginia that saw teachers converge on capitols this year, there were some successes but also disappointments. Still, advocates say, the movement will have lasting effects after pushing education onto the agenda of many midterm campaigns.\n\nMany candidates who won held themselves out as champions of public education, and the teachers union will be watching to ensure they live up to their pledges, said Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association.\n\n\u201cPromises were made to the public about commitments to those public school students, and we will be keeping score on who was for kids and who was just kidding, and that is going to make a huge difference in 2020,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvocates pointed to bright spots in the election results.\n\nWisconsin state schools Superintendent Tony Evers ousted Gov. Scott Walker, on whose watch teachers and other public workers lost nearly all collective bargaining power. Connecticut elected 2016 National Teacher of the Year Jahana Hayes to Congress. Democrat Tim Walz, who spent 20 years teaching and coaching high school, won the Minnesota governor\u2019s race, and math teacher Julie Blaha, a Democrat, was elected that state\u2019s auditor.\n\nSpeech pathologist Kathy Hoffman, a Democrat, declared victory Sunday over Republican Frank Riggs in the race to become Arizona\u2019s superintendent of public instruction, though the race remained too close to officially call, and four school principals or administrators were elected to the Oklahoma House.\n\nAlso, Arizona voters rejected a Republican-backed measure to expand the state\u2019s private school vouchers program, criticized as a move to drain money from public schools. And several funding measures passed, including a $500 million bond for school safety and water infrastructure in New Jersey and a constitutional amendment in Maryland to require casino revenue be set aside for schools.\n\nThe #RedforEd protests, in which teachers clad in red shirts converged on statehouses in conservative states including Oklahoma, had raised hopes of a groundswell of support for candidates who favored increased education spending and teachers who were inspired to run themselves.\n\nNationwide, polls showed education was not any more of a priority for most voters than in previous years, according to Rick Hess, director of education policy studies at American Enterprise Institute.\n\n\u201cWe were awestruck by the energy and the passion that arose in spring. We were awestruck by how successful the teachers were in states like West Virginia, and Oklahoma and Arizona, but if you look simply at the data in terms of what voters were thinking about and saying was a big issue going into the voting booth, there\u2019s little evidence education played a big role,\u201d Hess said Friday during an Educators Writer Association panel discussion at the National Press Club in Washington.\n\nIn West Virginia, where the national movement began with a statewide teachers\u2019 strike in February, teacher Cody Thompson, a Democrat, was elected as a state legislator Tuesday, but at least four other current or retired teachers lost House races. Still, teachers unions declared victory in the ouster of Republican majority leaders they had opposed in the House and Senate.\n\nIn Kentucky, teachers rallied against the Republican-dominated legislature for passing bills allowing charter schools and making changes to the state\u2019s retirement system. Protests in the spring shut down schools in more than 30 districts.\n\nSpecial education teacher Tina Bojanowski was one of at least 10 educators to win seats in the Kentucky Legislature, defeating Republican state Rep. Phil Moffett after campaigning while teaching full time. She was surprised there were not more.\n\n\u201cThe whole push for teachers running didn\u2019t pull as many voters over as it did, kind of just public dialogue,\u201d she said.\n\nUrie said a few students told her they were sorry she lost. She said she worries teachers\u2019 poor showing in the election will embolden lawmakers to pass more bills she does not like, but she is optimistic about seeing so many of her friends involved in the political process.\n\n\u201cI know people in my personal life who were never politically active, never really cared about it, that are just like so much more aware of what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all just kind of waiting to see what will happen. We\u2019re ready to respond when it does happen. If it does, we\u2019re ready to go back and fight for what we love.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThompson reported from Buffalo, N.Y.

Pat Roberts is working to get a farm bill passed to prove he\u2019s still a viable candidate for 2020.\n\nThe farm bill is crucial for the 82-year-old chairman of the Senate agriculture committee after he survived a 2014 primary challenge against a political newcomer with less than 50 percent of vote and needed a flood of national money to win the general election. It\u2019s unlikely he would be able to avoid another primary challenge or a strong Democratic challenger if he runs for a fifth term, which would keep him in office through his 90th birthday, The Wichita Eagle reports.\n\n\u201cMarines always take the hill,\u201d Roberts told McClatchy in September. \u201cYou just want to know whether you want to take that next hill down the road. Let\u2019s just get this one (the farm bill) done and the rest will take care of itself.\u201d\n\nOne of the main points of conflict between the House and Senate versions of the farm bill involves proposed changes to food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. House-passed legislation significantly tightens existing work requirements for aid recipients, but the Senate version makes only modest changes.\n\nNegotiations are underway during the congressional break, as Republicans get one last shot as the House majority before Democrats take control in January.\n\nRoberts said the Senate bill includes new oversight measures and encourages states to expand their work training programs. He argued that these measures would ensure the program\u2019s integrity and won\u2019t cost the bill the Democratic votes it needs to pass the Senate.\n\nKansas Republican Rep. Roger Marshall, who sits on the House Agriculture Committee, is an outspoken supporter of work requirements for food stamp recipients. If Roberts\u2019 doesn\u2019t run for another term, Kansas Republican leaders say Marshall, who represents Roberts\u2019 old House seat, is the most likely candidate for his Senate seat.\n\nMarshall called Roberts a friend and a mentor in a statement when asked whether he would consider running should Roberts retire.\n\nOther possible contenders could include Rep. Kevin Yoder, who lost to Democrat Sharice Davids in this year\u2019s election, and outgoing Gov. Jeff Colyer, who lost the Republican gubernatorial primary to Kris Kobach by 343 votes .\n\n\u201cGov. Colyer has not ruled out the possibility,\u201d spokeswoman Kara Zeyer said. \u201cHe\u2019s open to any opportunity that will allow him to continue to serve the people of Kansas in the future in the best way that he can.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle, http://www.kansas.com", "LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) \u2014 Wyoming\u2019s offense has undergone a transformation with Sean Chambers at the controls.\n\nSince the true freshman took over at quarterback 10 quarters ago, the unit has scored eight touchdowns. The Cowboys have put up 24.6 points (six more than their season average) and 404.3 yards a game (86 more than their season average), including season-highs in both categories during a two-game winning streak that still has Wyoming clinging to hope of a third straight bowl game.\n\nWyoming is sustaining drives better than it has all season by largely staying ahead of the chains on the legs of Chambers and Nico Evans, who\u2019ve each rushed for more than 100 yards in the last three games. It\u2019s opened things up on the rare occasions the Cowboys throw the ball with Chambers completing 61 percent of his passes.\n\nTyler Vander Waal has had a front-row seat to it all.\n\nIt\u2019s a voluntary position taken by Vander Waal, whom Chambers replaced in the second half of the Cowboys\u2019 24-16 setback to Utah State \u2014 their fourth straight loss at the time. It would\u2019ve been easy to check out mentally after losing his starting job, but Vander Waal said not supporting his successor would\u2019ve been both selfish and hypocritical of him.\n\n\u2033(Chambers) was supportive of me,\u201d Vander Waal told the Casper Star-Tribune. \u201cAnd I think all the quarterbacks are really supportive of each other. I think it speaks a lot to just how close the quarterbacks are. I don\u2019t care who\u2019s playing. I don\u2019t think we care who\u2019s playing. As long as we\u2019re having success and getting the job done and winning games, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s always been easy for Vander Waal and his competitive nature to watch from the sideline, but he understands why head coach Craig Bohl benched him eight games into the season.\n\nEven with the threat of Evans, the nation\u2019s second-leading rusher, Wyoming\u2019s offense rarely found balance with Vander Waal under center. The Cowboys ranked last in the Mountain West in yards, points and passing yards through their first seven games and were converting on third down less than 30 percent of the time \u2014 the worst clip in the FBS.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a firm believer that everything happens for a reason,\u201d Vander Waal said. \u201cI look at it as it\u2019s what\u2019s best for the team. It wasn\u2019t all about me. I wasn\u2019t getting the job done, so we put the next guy up. Sean\u2019s getting the job done.\u201d\n\nVander Waal completed just 50.2 percent of his passes in the first eight games, tossing more interceptions (4) than touchdowns (3). He was sacked 20 times, a combination of a young offensive line struggling to protect him and him admitting he held the ball longer than he should\u2019ve at times.\n\nWith the offense going 10 straight quarters without a touchdown heading into the second half against Utah State, it became as much of a mental hurdle for Vander Waal as anything physical. Chambers came on for good after Vander Waal threw an ill-advised interception with Wyoming backed up inside its own 10-yard line on the first play of the third quarter.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest thing for me is just confidence,\u201d Vander Waal said. \u201cI kind of lacked confidence. I\u2019d get in my head a little too much. I\u2019d miss a throw and I\u2019d get down on myself, and that would affect the next three or four throws.\u201d\n\nBut Vander Waal has stayed engaged, taking all the mental reps he can now that he\u2019s the backup while offering support along the way. Amid the team\u2019s celebration at Canvas Stadium following Wyoming\u2019s third straight Border War win over Colorado State on Oct. 26, Vander Waal found Chambers in the corner of the South end zone and congratulated him on his three-touchdown night as part of the Cowboys\u2019 34-21 victory.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily say a cheerleader for Sean because Sean doesn\u2019t necessarily need a cheerleader, but he\u2019s been a really good teammate,\u201d Bohl said. \u201cI think that\u2019s an indication of our football team. There\u2019s not guys out there that have a selfish agenda. We appreciate Tyler, and there may come a time when his services are needed. He\u2019s prepared for that.\u201d\n\nVander Waal is staying ready knowing he\u2019s one play away from being back under center, but he\u2019s also got a future to think about should Chambers finish the season as the starter. With both of them being freshmen, would Vander Waal look for more consistent playing time somewhere else?\n\nRight now, Vander Waal said that\u2019s not the plan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fully bought in,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really care who\u2019s playing as long as we\u2019re winning games.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Casper (Wyo.)

(AP) \u2014 The minority floor leader of the Kentucky House of Representatives has filed paperwork to raise money for a campaign for governor, setting up a potentially spirited Democratic primary in 2019 to challenge Republican incumbent Matt Bevin.\n\nState Rep. Rocky Adkins and running mate Stephanie Horne are listed on the website of the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance for the May 21, 2019, primary. Adkins is scheduled to make a \u201cspecial announcement\u201d Wednesday in Morehead, Kentucky. Adkins declined to comment Monday through a spokeswoman.\n\nKentucky is one of three states that will elect a governor in 2019, along with Louisiana and Mississippi. Bevin announced in August he will seek a second term. But he has yet to file for the office or begin raising money.\n\nBevin\u2019s approval ratings sank in the spring, after he criticized teachers and other public workers for opposing his proposed changes to the state\u2019s troubled pension systems. His low numbers have given Democrats hope they can defeat him. But in last week\u2019s elections, even after many Democratic legislative candidates ran ads critical of Bevin, Republicans maintained massive majorities in the state legislature.\n\nAdkins grew up in Elliott County, a reliable source of Democratic votes since 1869. He played basketball at Morehead State University. When he was a senior in 1983, the Eagles won the Ohio Valley Conference Championship and earned a berth in the NCAA tournament, where the team lost to sixth-seeded Syracuse in the first round.\n\nThree years later, at age 26, Adkins was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives. He\u2019s been there ever since, serving as House majority floor leader from 2003 until 2016, when Republicans won a majority in the House for the first time in nearly 100 years.\n\nAs minority leader, Adkins has been among the most vocal opponents to Republican rule in Kentucky. He slammed the GOP for passing laws that make it harder for labor unions to operate and for making changes to the state\u2019s underfunded pension systems without first having an actuarial analysis of the final proposal as required by law.\n\nHorne is a real estate attorney and member of the Jefferson County Board of Education. She did seek re-election this year.\n\nAdkins will face Attorney General Andy Beshear in the Democratic primary. Beshear announced his candidacy in July. Since then, he and running mate Jacqueline Coleman have raised more than $660,000.\n\n\u201cThe obvious disadvantage Adkins faces is that legislators usually do not have the statewide name recognition of people who served in statewide elected offices,\u201d University of Kentucky political science professor Stephen Voss said.\n\nAdkins has been traveling the state extensively for two years, speaking at the annual Fancy Farm Picnic in 2017 and campaigning for Democratic legislative candidates this year. And he has garnered news coverage as he criticized Beshear for raising money for the 2019 governor\u2019s race ahead of the 2018 midterm elections when Democrats were trying to weaken the Republican majorities in the state legislature.\n\nMost voters in eastern Kentucky are registered Democrats, which could help Adkins in a primary election. But Voss said the key to Adkins\u2019 success will be how many other Democrats jump into the race. Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes is also considering a run for governor or some other statewide elected office, as is former Auditor Adam Edelen and Attica Scott, a state representative from Louisville.\n\n\u201cIf we have several Democrats splitting up the city vote, then having a strong base in either eastern or western Kentucky could make a real difference,\u201d he said.", "MCCOOL JUNCTION, Neb.

The car struck one of the cruisers on the driver\u2019s side during the chase, injuring the trooper.\n\nThe car then reversed course and headed north in the southbound lanes before being stopped by a trooper.\n\nThe driver was arrested on suspicion of assault on an officer and other crimes.

While other officials implicated in the plot have fled the country, the former intelligence chief is now residing in northern Ethiopia and should turn himself in to authorities, he said.\n\nYilikal Getnet, an opposition figure, told The Associated Press the public had demanded the arrests of the former officials.\n\n\u201cThese have been issues that we in the opposition have long been calling for, too,\u201d he said, adding that Ethiopia needs a truth and reconciliation process to investigate past misdoings. \u201cThe ruling party alone can\u2019t bring justice for all these atrocities committed in the past.\u201d\n\nUnder the previous government, Ethiopia, a close security ally of the West, used to be accused of rights violations by human rights activists. Since Abiy, 42, came to power in April his new government has released several thousand political prisoners, permitted exiled opposition groups to return home, dropped terror charges against prominent opposition politicians and permitted the media to operate more freely.\n\nDespite the reforms, ethnic-based clashes are continuing in some parts of Ethiopia and pose the most serious threat to Abiy\u2019s leadership of this East African nation of 100 million people.\n\nAmnesty International welcomed the arrests.\n\n\u201cThese arrests are an important first step toward ensuring full accountability for the abuses that have dogged the country for several decades,\u201d said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International\u2019s East Africa Director. \u201cMany of these officials were at the helm of government agencies infamous for perpetrating gross human rights violations, such as torture and the arbitrary detention of people including in secret facilities.

But with Veronica Rawlins\u2019 leadership, they (the other women are played by Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki and Carrie Coon) resolve to take over their late husbands\u2019 criminal plans and pull off what none expect them capable of.\n\n\u201cThis was a great experiment in exploring how to work out getting back your power,\u201d says Davis. \u201cIn my life I\u2019m still learning that.\u201d\n\nWhen a reporter points out that she \u2014 one of the most movingly outspoken advocates for on-screen representation and inclusion \u2014 seems quite in control of her considerable power, Davis demurs. \u201cLike everyone, I have my good moments and bad moments.\u201d\n\nDavis has won an Oscar (for \u201cFences\u201d), an Emmy (for \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d) and a Tony, twice (for \u201cFences\u201d and \u201cKing Hedley II\u201d) \u2014 a trifecta that no other black actor has accomplished, and few others, for that matter. Along the way, her impassioned acceptance speeches have been some of the most potent thunderbolts of inspiration in the wider fight for diversity, beamed out to the unrepresented and the overlooked everywhere.\n\nBut it\u2019s been almost a decade since her \u201cDoubt\u201d co-star Meryl Streep pleaded \u201cMy God, somebody give her a movie!\u201d at the Screen Actors Guild Awards (and later called her \u201cpossessed to the blazing, incandescent power\u201d). Since then, Davis has been a mainstay on screens big and small, but she has seldom \u2014 except in the Shonda Rhimes ABC series and now \u201cWidows\u201d \u2014 been front and center. She has even expressed some regret over 2011\u2032s \u201cThe Help,\u201d noting \u201cit wasn\u2019t the voices of the maids that were heard.\u201d The same year, Davis formed a production company with her husband, the actor Julius Tennon, with whom she has an eight-year-old daughter.\n\nFor McQueen, Davis\u2019 lack of leading performances is one of the most glaring injustices in Hollywood.\n\n\u201cShe can only be judged by the films she gets to do. Don\u2019t forget: she could not really make a living in film because no one was giving her any roles,\u201d McQueen said by phone. \u201cShe was not given an opportunity to fulfill her craft. So she had to go on television. Viola\u2019s 53 years old. She should have a vast body of work by now.\u201d\n\nDoes Davis feel the same way?\n\n\u201cI mean, yeah,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI sort of feel that sometimes. But I\u2019m honored that I\u2019ve gotten to this point. This is a very privileged life. I feel like if I sit here and I say, \u2018I should have had more lead roles,\u2019 some dissatisfaction with the moment \u2014 I can\u2019t do that. I really can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDavis, the fifth of their six children, grew up impoverished, in dilapidated homes in Rhode Island, the daughter of an alcoholic father who was abusive to Davis\u2019 mother.\n\n\u201cI became an actor because I was an observer. It\u2019s said that actors are observers and they\u2019re thieves. You observe life and then you steal from it,\u201d says Davis. \u201cThe beauty of how I grew up is I saw so many horrific but glorious things happen in public. When you grow up poor, nothing is undercover. You hear everything played out because people are living in close proximity to each other. You know who the alcoholic is. You know who\u2019s getting beaten by their husband.\u201d\n\nDavis has said before that she\u2019s motivated to honor the dreams of her \u201ceight-year-old self.\u201d \u2033She\u2019s always sitting there,\u201d says Davis. \u201cAnd, really, it\u2019s easy to make her happy, whereas it\u2019s sort of hard to make me happy now.\u201d And she lets out a belly laugh.\n\nThat upbringing has informed how Davis has responded to the #MeToo movement: applauding it, encouraging it, but also fearing that its focus on Hollywood actresses and executives is limited. She cites her long-running involvement with Gail Abarbanel\u2019s Rape Treatment Center at the Stuart House as the kind of place that needs support.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much bigger than a hashtag,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWidows,\u201d penned by McQueen and Gillian Flynn (\u201cGone Girl\u201d) is based on Lynda La Plante\u2019s 1980s British series, but its tale of female empowerment has obvious connections to today. In rehearsals, McQueen would sit with Davis and the other actresses and talk through their own experiences. \u201cAll the things in our lives that we felt people didn\u2019t see,\u201d says Davis. \u201cLike my femininity.\u201d\n\nMcQueen wanted to bring all of those stories to the table. Davis would have preferred to wear a wig but McQueen disagreed. He wanted Davis to look just how she is. \u201cI know this woman,\u201d McQueen told her. \u201cShe just hasn\u2019t been in the American cinema. So it\u2019s about time we introduced her.\u201d\n\nDavis has made such introductions a regularity, bringing one African-American woman after another to a screen where they didn\u2019t before exist.\n\n\u201cMy big thing \u2014 this is my ego \u2014 I always want people to look back at this time and I want my name to be in it. I always want to be in the conversation,\u201d she says. \u201cNot just in movies, just in terms of people seeing themselves differently.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP", "EUGENE, Ore.

(AP Photo/Tim Ireland)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 The opening matches at the ATP Finals led to a debate over whether conditions at the O2 Arena were trickier than in past years.\n\nNovak Djokovic ended it.\n\nThe Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion made an impressive start to his campaign for a sixth title by dismissing John Isner 6-4, 6-3 on Monday.\n\nRoger Federer, who lost on Sunday, and Alexander Zverev described conditions as challenging following their error-strewn opening matches at the season-ending tournament, but Djokovic dropped just six points on his serve and made six unforced errors.\n\n\u201cMy results here have been pretty good in the last 10 years, so I can\u2019t complain too much,\u201d said Djokovic, who has won four titles at the London venue. \u201cIt takes a little bit of time really to get yourself adjusted to the surface because the surface is a good surface.\u201d\n\nA day after a ceremony to mark ending the season as No. 1, Djokovic underlined his status by nullifying Isner\u2019s usually destructive serve.\n\nIsner, who at 33 became the season-ending tournament\u2019s oldest debutant since 1972, applied himself admirably but barely avoided being broken more than once in the first set, and was broken twice more in the second set.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d Isner said of the atmosphere. \u201cI wish I could have given them a bit more to cheer for.\u201d\n\nThe one break Djokovic converted in the first set, at 2-2, was a cross-court forehand return winner which stranded Isner.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo was in attendance, with Djokovic perhaps spurred on even more by the Juventus forward\u2019s presence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to have big football star, sports star like him, courtside watching tennis,\u201d Djokovic said.\n\nAt 3-3, 15-30 in the second set, Isner sent down a second serve at 126 mph (203 kph). Djokovic sent it straight back at his feet and a shocked Isner hit his backhand long to concede two more break points.\n\nA forehand error from Isner confirmed the break, and the end of the contest. The merciless Djokovic held serve before breaking Isner once more with an inch-perfect backhand passing shot on match point.\n\n\u201cThat was pretty comprehensive out there,\u201d Isner conceded.\n\nEarlier, Zverev came from a break down in both sets to defeat Marin Cilic 7-6 (5), 7-6 (1).\n\nFacing each other in their opening match for a second straight year, Zverev produced the slightly steadier tennis in an attritional contest to extend his record against Cilic to 2-0 at the O2 Arena and 6-1 overall.\n\nCilic, who made 46 unforced errors, dropped to 1-9 across his four appearances at the tournament.\n\n\u201cThe win, that\u2019s the most important thing,\u201d said Zverev, who failed to advance from the round-robin stage on his debut last year.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "16 soldiers in 2 vans crash on Parks Highway; no one injured\n\nANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Sixteen Fort Wainwright soldiers and other motorists escaped injury in a four-vehicle crash on the Parks Highway.\n\nThe crash occurred late Friday morning at Mile 169 about 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of Cantwell.\n\nAlaska State Troopers say 26-year-old Logan Haga was driving a van carrying eight other soldiers.

(AP) \u2014 Born to desert nomads, Abdi Nor Iftin grew up in Somalia listening to his parents\u2019 tales of fighting lions and hyenas to protect their camels and goats.\n\nHe says he knew his mother and father were strong and brave, and their bravery served them well after a drought killed his family\u2019s animals and forced them to move to Mogadishu. The city soon was wracked by violence, first from Somali warlords, then from Islamic extremists.\n\nBut there is much more to the world than hunger and fear. Abdi learned that from the American movies he started watching as a young boy after a neighbor set up a makeshift movie theater in a shack with small TV set and a short stack of tapes. Abdi and his friends watched them over and over, but none of the kids loved the movies as much as he did, so much that they started calling him \u201cAbdi American.\u201d\n\nReading movie subtitles and translating dialogue for his friends, Abdi picked up the language quickly and grew determined to move to the land of Arnold Swartzenegger and Bruce Willis. No beatings from the head of the madrasa, the Muslim school, could keep him away from the movie shack for long, he recalled.\n\nU.S. Marines who came to Somalia for a while also became his American heroes. Instead of pointing their weapons and yelling at the children, they smiled and gave out candy.\n\n\u201cWherever these guys go, I want to go there,\u201d he told himself.\n\nThere was nothing Abdi wanted more than to live in America, he explained. Music fed that love, and he said he started carrying around a boom box that he took to weddings and danced to, an increasingly dangerous thing to do under Sharia Law imposed by the jihadist fundamentalists of al-Shabaab.\n\nSomalia was a failed state, and life in Mogadishu became a living hell, he explained.\n\nThere were no police, no firefighters. Guns were given freely to young boys, and human life seemed of little value. Abdi said his sole focus was on getting out, and he and his brother fled to Kenya as refugees.\n\nAbdi tells the riveting story of his struggle to come to the United States in his memoir, \u201cCall Me American,\u201d published this year by Alfred A. Knopf.\n\nDuring a recent evening program at Amherst Town Library, Abdi told attendees of how he met Paul Salopek, one of the few journalist in Mogadishu, which led to Abdi posting secret dispatches to National Public Radio.\n\n\u201cHe has a story the world has to hear,\u201d Salopek told NPR.\n\nListening to one of his stories over breakfast one day, a family in Maine decided to sponsor him, and Team Abdi was formed.\n\nBut it still took years of ups \u2014 including the winning of a green card lottery \u2014 and some harrowing downs for him to get a green card and finally board a plane to Boston.\n\nAs the plane banked over Logan Airport, \u201cI felt like I was going up to heaven,\u201d he said.\n\nThat was in 2015, when he was 27. He is not officially an American yet \u2014 as it takes five years to become a full voting citizen \u2014 but Abdi now works as a translator and goes to school.\n\nHis story often is grim and horrifying. Friends were killed by bombs or drowned in overstuffed boats bound for Yemen. A baby sister starved. A man was shot to death in front of him. He has nightmares every night, and fears for the life of his mother in Somalia and cried as he talked of her love and courage. His brother, Hassan, has been in Kenya for 17 years, living the limbo life of a refugee.\n\nBut the spirit that brought Abdi to America still is evident, and he talked about all the things here that excite him, like collecting mail, or the fact that he can drive himself from Maine to New Hampshire for a book tour that also took him to Chicago and Seattle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still unbelievable,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2PWbUNk\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Telegraph, http://www.nashuatelegraph.com", "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Rice University researchers are concerned about the Army Corps of Engineers and the Texas General Land Office\u2019s preferred $31 billion proposal to protect the Houston-Galveston region from devastating storm surge.\n\nA group of Rice professors plan to raise questions about the coastal protection project of levees and sea gates, known as the \u201cIke Dike,\u201d during the public comment period, the Houston Chronicle reported.

Madison\u2019s Cafe is set to close Nov. 30 after a host of factors resulted in a \u201cridiculous overhead,\u201d said co-owner Nicole McCoomb, whose 20-year-old daughter inspired the business concept, which opened in April 2017.\n\nBeing located at the busy intersection of Route 236 and Portland Street is a catch-22 of sorts. While there\u2019s lots of traffic, there\u2019s not a lot of stopping, and it\u2019s not necessarily pedestrian friendly, McCoomb said. It was a Wednesday afternoon at lunchtime and she pointed around the cafe; it was empty.\n\nMadison\u2019s doesn\u2019t have its own designated parking. The nearby municipal lot is typically full with downtown employees and residents, and McCoomb said parallel parking along a traffic-packed street isn\u2019t conducive to the \u201cgrab and go\u201d model of a cafe.\n\nBetween rent and upkeep costs, the cafe is thousands of dollars in debt. McCoomb and her business partner Sean Roy said while they\u2019re looking for some sort of miracle, they know simply paying off their overhead isn\u2019t going to sustain them for the long term.\n\n\u201cWe either want to be able to stay here and succeed or move to a better location,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have such a great concept, we don\u2019t want to lose it. We want to expand on it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s McCoomb\u2019s dream to turn the cafe into a training facility, where people with developmental disabilities can learn simple life skills, like eye contact, handling money, running a register and social interaction. In a \u201cperfect world,\u201d she said, the cafe would be in a bigger building, with more staff, and have its own parking lot.\n\n\u201cIn that world, this would be a hoppin\u2019 cafe,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are endless possibilities for things we could do here. There is nothing else like this around.\u201d\n\nMcCoomb pointed to an unemployment rate of more than 80 percent for young people with disabilities. A few years ago, when she began to chart her daughter Madison\u2019s future, she wanted to be able to provide her with stable, supportive employment.\n\n\u201cThe light bulb just went off in my head,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like it took me 45 years to see what I was meant to do in life. It is so needed in this community.\u201d\n\nMcCoomb and Roy had been friends since high school, and they took on the concept together. Within 12 days, they had signed the lease and the business opened two months later. That year, York County Community College named Madison\u2019s \u201cEmployer of the Year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey need to work and they deserve to work,\u201d McCoomb said of young people with disabilities.\n\nEmployee Alex Ferguson said she really likes working at Madison\u2019s and wants to see it continue. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see it disappear,\u201d she said. \u201cIt means too much to me. It feels like more than just a job.\u201d\n\nFerguson said she never had a job until Madison\u2019s, and it was her first time going through an interview process. McCoomb said Ferguson has \u201cblossomed like a flower.\u201d One day, her father came into the cafe and \u201cstood in the corner crying,\u201d saying he couldn\u2019t believe the difference he saw in his daughter on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cThat is one for the most amazing things I\u2019ve felt, to see someone react that way to what we do here,\u201d McCoomb said.\n\nEmployee Brooke Johnson couldn\u2019t stop smiling as she talked about her job at Madison\u2019s. \u201cWith my experiences here, I feel like it\u2019s been a tremendous opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cI really appreciate what Sean and Nicole have done for us.

Supporters say the effort has the potential to help relieve growing demand on the arid state's water resources. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File)\n\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 With drought a constant consideration for New Mexico, state and federal officials are warning that decisions about water are growing more complicated and opportunities to tap untraditional sources should be considered.\n\nThe state, with the help of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, has drafted a document that outlines areas where regulations can be streamlined to encourage the treatment and reuse of wastewater that comes from oil and natural gas operations.\n\nThe white paper released late last week says oil and gas production in New Mexico generated nearly 38 billion gallons (143 billion liters) of wastewater in 2017. As the boom in oil production continues in the Permian Basin\u2019s well fields along the Texas-New Mexico border, officials say so will the amount of wastewater \u2014 known in the industry as produced water.\n\n\u201cOur effort to clarify the state and federal regulatory landscape dealing with produced water will facilitate greater produced water reuse and recycling and in turn help relieve the growing demand on the state\u2019s water resources,\u201d state energy secretary Ken McQueen said in a statement.\n\nAside from highlighting New Mexico\u2019s rise in 2018 as one of the largest oil-producing states in the U.S., the document outlines the arid state\u2019s challenges with drought.\n\nReceiving an average of slightly less than 15 inches (380 millimeters) of rainfall a year, New Mexico is already the fifth driest state in the nation, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That aridness was exacerbated this year as runoff along the Rio Grande and Pecos rivers marked some of the lowest levels in decades. Water managers were forced to broker deals to keep the Rio Grande flowing through the state\u2019s most populous city.\n\n\u201cWhile conservation plays an important role in managing the state\u2019s limited water resources, it is not enough,\u201d the authors of the white paper wrote.\n\nIn New Mexico and other parts of the West, some stakeholders are asking whether production water from the oil and gas industry should continue to be treated as wastewater. Critics have voiced concerns about the lack of knowledge about the potential toxicity of the water.\n\nThe water usually contains chemicals, metals and other dissolved solids. Most of it is disposed of by injecting it deep underground, where it can no longer be accessed or used. In some cases, it can be reused in the oilfield for other drilling processes.\n\nFor every barrel of oil, it\u2019s estimated four or five barrels of produced water are generated.\n\nThe state and the EPA are looking at what steps would be needed to treat it for other purposes, acknowledging that there are still health and environmental questions that need to be answered if the water were to be used beyond the industry.\n\nState and federal officials began working on the white paper in July in hopes of clarifying existing regulatory and permitting rules related to the way produced water can be reused and recycled.\n\nThe state is working to finalize the draft before the end of the year.\n\nRobert McEntyre, a spokesman for the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, said some companies already reuse the water for their own purposes.\n\n\u201cWhat New Mexico lacks right now is the regulatory framework to be able to address using it for other purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly there\u2019s an opportunity and given the growth we\u2019ve seen, it could be a game-changer if the regulations catch up to where industry is.\u201d", "BILLINGS, Mont.

It provides an overview of smart factory and the need to have open platforms.\n\nThis is because one of the key considerations while deploying IIoT systems is the manner in which legacy systems are handled as many legacy devices in industrial settings have a long lifespan and it may not be economically viable to upgrade a large number of devices so as to be able to communicate with the cloud.\n\nIIoT brings together two separate technologies: Enterprise IT for resource planning and decision support systems, and Operations technology that controls machines/equipment, manufacturing and the related processes. Leveraging this will also require equipping the workforce with adequate skills, and this requires preparation. It is expected that IIoT will offer opportunities to the workforce for learning new skills. It will also computerize many of the tasks, particularly those that are of repetitive nature. In order to cash in on the bigger opportunities from IIoT, the workforce in organizations need to possess skills in data science, software development, hardware engineering, testing, etc. Companies, clients and other stakeholders have to collaborate in order to mitigate the risks typical to those connected to networks.\n\nIIoT platforms are still in an emerging phase and companies are trying to establish themselves across many industries. There is a growing need to come up with open architecture and companies are starting to develop and share non-proprietary platforms. The benefits are for all stakeholders. Companies stand to save more by moving from a fix when fail approach to predictive maintenance. Suppliers also benefit as a result of reduced warranty fulfillment costs.\n\nThe study also provides information on the areas of opportunity for suppliers of automation products and systems. It includes three case studies to illustrate how embracing IIoT has helped end users achieve better performance. While it is still early to accurately estimate the benefits, there are technology challenges that need to be overcome, especially in the areas of connectivity and security.\n\nKey Issues Addressed\n\nWhat is IIoT and what are its key components? What are the major drivers and the restraints for IIoT adoption across Asia-Pacific? What is the current market size and what are the prevailing trends across the region? Is IIoT being deployed in a large scale? What benefits are available to end users by implementing IIoT solutions, and why is it important?\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n1. Executive Summary\n\n2.

The NHL and attorneys for retired players have reached a tentative settlement worth roughly $19 million in the biggest lawsuit brought against the league over concussions and other head injuries. Carcillo, who played nine NHL seasons and joined the lawsuit in June, posted several messages of displeasure with the settlement on his verified Twitter account. (AP Photo/Ann Heisenfelt, FIle)\n\nThe National Hockey League announced a tentative $18.9 million settlement Monday with more than 300 retired players who sued the league and accused it of failing to protect them from head injuries or warning them of the risks involved with playing.\n\nThe lawsuit, consolidated in federal court in Minnesota, was by far the largest facing the league. The NHL, as it has for years, did not acknowledge any liability for the players\u2019 claims in the proposed settlement and can terminate the deal if all 318 players or their estates don\u2019t elect to participate.\n\nThe settlement is significantly less than the billion-dollar agreement reached between the NFL and its former players on the same issue of head injuries. Each player who opts in would receive $22,000 and could be eligible for up to $75,000 in medical treatment.\n\n\u201cThe cash amount of $22,000, that\u2019s small, but we were always looking for (medical) coverage to begin with,\u201d said former player Reed Larson, who was among the first to sue the league over head injuries that could lead to the brain disease Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. \u201cThe bottom line is this is monitoring, testing and hopefully help for players that will either have (CTE) now or could get it in the future.\u201d\n\nPlayers\u2019 attorney Stuart Davidson said he knows there will be comparisons between the NHL and NFL settlements, even though they differ drastically.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a defendant who has spent millions of dollars litigating a case for four years to prove that nothing is wrong with getting your brain bashed in, you can only get so far,\u201d Davidson told The Associated Press. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for players who have an opportunity to settle their case with the NHL now to understand that before they get anything through a trial against the NHL it\u2019s going to cost millions of dollars in experts to get there, and that\u2019s going to have to be paid for before they see a penny from any recovery, assuming they win.\u201d\n\nAn NHL spokesman said the league would not make any comment until after the opt-in period of 75 days for players. There were 146 players who added their names to the lawsuit as plaintiffs between November 2013 and this August and 172 more who joined as claimants.\n\nIn addition to the cash payment, the settlement includes neurological testing and assessment for players paid for by the league; up to $75,000 in medical treatment for players who test positive on two or more tests; and a \u201cCommon Good Fund\u201d for retired players in need, including those who did not participate in the litigation, worth $2.5 million.\n\nPittsburgh star Sidney Crosby, who has dealt with concussion problems throughout his career but is not involved in the lawsuit that includes only retired players, told reporters after practice the league, Players\u2019 Association and others must all have a role in the issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something as players that we know that risk,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cObviously we know a lot more now than we did before, even a lot more than we did when I had my first one. It\u2019s something you hope they can mutually agree on. It\u2019s something that I think is important from both sides.\u201d\n\nRetired player Daniel Carcillo, one of the plaintiffs, urged players not to accept the settlement. In a series of tweets , he said players would be forced to see the same NHL and NHLPA doctors to determine if they\u2019d be eligible for treatment.\n\nCarcillo also asked for Wayne Gretzky\u2019s thoughts: \u201cI want him to use his platform to help the men who protected him throughout his career. Lack of pressure from former players is a direct result of this insulting attempt at a settlement.\u201d\n\nCharles Zimmerman, who was a lead attorney for players, said he was most disappointed the lawsuit couldn\u2019t assure future benefits for all retired players like in the NFL.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a very appropriate result and a good outcome in a very contested, hotly litigated matter,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cThe main goal in the case was to get medical testing and treatment for the players, something that the NHL wouldn\u2019t agree to for the four years that we\u2019d been litigating and that\u2019s what we achieved.\u201d\n\nThe settlement comes four months after a federal judge denied class-action status for the retired players, a significant victory for the league in the lawsuit filed in November 2013. U.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson in July denied class-action status, citing \u201cwidespread differences\u201d in state laws about medical monitoring that would \u201cpresent significant case management difficulties.\u201d\n\nThe bid for class-action status would have created one group of all living former NHL players and one group of all retired players diagnosed with a neurological disease, disorder or condition. Had Nelson certified the class action, more than 5,000 former players would have been able to join the case.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising after the NHL prevailed on the class-action motion that there would have been movements in this direction,\u201d NHLPA executive director Don Fehr told reporters in Toronto. \u201cI\u2019m glad for the parties that it\u2019s all over. Hopefully people can go on with their lives and now we can perhaps deal with these issues with the NHL without having to worry about the effect on the litigation.\u201d\n\nDavidson called Nelson\u2019s decision a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for the case and that players lost leverage as a result.\n\n\u201cIt severely limited the damages to the NHL owners and benefits to the NHL players,\u201d Vanderbilt University sports economic professor John Vrooman wrote in an email to the AP. \u201cThis decision essentially forced the 140 (plus) players involved in the suit to settle and prevented the participation of all other potential litigants. So it will seem that both sides \u2018won\u2019 in what was really a lopsided victory for the owners. It\u2019s just that all of the owners won by gaining current and future protection from damages and a minor fraction of the players won something that they would have zero chance in obtaining in isolation versus the league.\u201d\n\nSettlement talks ramped back up in July with an agreement reached Nov. 7.\n\nBettman and Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly have, on multiple occasions, said the lawsuit had no merit.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to focusing on concussions and trying to understand them and how to treat them, we\u2019ve been leaders in the field,\u201d Bettman told the AP in May. \u201cAnd that gets completely lost in the rhetoric of the litigation, and I don\u2019t like discussing the litigation. There is a sense because it gets sensationalized that the reality of our position with player safety is somehow at odds with the reality of the science and the medicine and it\u2019s not true. We study it very closely.\u201d\n\nThe NFL settlement covers more than 20,000 retired players, and lawyers expect payouts to top $1.5 billion over 65 years. As of last month , the NFL concussion lawsuit claims panel has approved more than $500 million in awards and paid out $330 million.\n\n___\n\nAP Hockey Writer John Wawrow and Associated Press Writer Amy Forliti contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Deputy Secretary of State Julie Flynn looks over papers during the ballot-tabulation process for Maine's Second Congressional District's House election Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, in Augusta, Maine. The election is the first congressional race in American history to be decided by the ranked-choice voting method that allows second choices. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty)\n\nPORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 The election drew to a close last week in most places but not in fishing villages, potato farms and vast tracts of wilderness that comprise Maine\u2019s 2nd Congressional District.\n\nThe four-way political battle won\u2019t conclude until a computer algorithm has the final say this week on whether Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin wins re-election or is ousted by Democratic state lawmaker Jared Golden.\n\nThe new way of voting in which all candidates are ranked on a ballot made its national debut in U.S. House and Senate races in Maine.\n\nUnder the system, a candidate wins with a majority of first-place votes. If there\u2019s no majority, the last-place candidate\u2019s second-place votes are reallocated to remaining candidates. The computerized process can be repeated until there\u2019s a winner.\n\nAcross the country, voting reform advocates are watching as the system faces its biggest test in the most expensive race in Maine history.\n\n\u201cThis will either fuel the adoption of ranked-choice voting in other jurisdictions, or it will stop it in its tracks,\u201d said Corey Cook, dean of the School of Public Service at Boise State University, who has studied 100 elections that used the system.\n\nMaine residents approved the system in 2016 after nine of the previous 11 gubernatorial elections resulted in winners who failed to get a majority of the vote.\n\nProponents say the system allows people to vote for third-party or independent candidates without concern for political \u201cspoilers\u201d or vote-splitting. They say it also moderates campaigns because candidates don\u2019t want to alienate supporters of other candidates in the event they need second-place votes to reach a majority.\n\nCritics say the ballot and system can be confusing to voters. They also say bland campaigns don\u2019t allow candidates to differentiate themselves.\n\nThe system is sometimes referred to as an \u201cinstant runoff\u201d in the dozen or so municipalities where it\u2019s used. But there\u2019s nothing instant about the process in Maine. All of the ballots, more than 600,000 of them, had to be shipped to Augusta and scanned into a computer. That process continued on Monday.\n\nIn Maine, Poliquin had an edge Tuesday night of about 2,000 first-round votes over Golden but fell far short of reaching the 50 percent threshold. That means the outcome will hinge upon second-choice votes from more than 20,000 supporters of two independents who together collected about 8 percent of the vote.\n\nIf it works as intended, then it\u2019s possible the Republican incumbent with the most first-place votes could end up losing to a Democrat.\n\nSome expect a lawsuit to challenge the one-person, one-vote rule under the theory that the system lets the supporter of a last-place candidate to effectively vote twice, violating the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nThe Maine GOP and Poliquin already have complained about unlocked ballot boxes and other irregularities, furthering speculation of a legal challenge. Poliquin has declined to say if he\u2019ll sue if he loses the ranked-choice election. Golden also declined to comment on the voting process.\n\nRob Richie, of FairVote, an organization that\u2019s pressing for ranked voting nationwide, dismissed murmurs of possible lawsuits as \u201csore loser talk.\u201d\n\nSeveral courts, including the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, have upheld the constitutionality of ranked-choice voting, he said.\n\nEven though legal precedents favor ranked-choice voting in federal elections in Maine, a lawsuit is certainly possible given the high stakes, said James Monteleone, attorney for the Committee for Ranked Choice Voting in Maine.\n\n\u201cWhen political candidates find themselves in a difficult situation, creative lawyers come up with creative ideas,\u201d he said.\n\nIf there is a lawsuit, it would likely be in federal court in Maine, said Jim Burke, a professor from the University of Maine School of Law.\n\nFor now, the voting system is used only in federal races and in statewide primary elections in Maine. It cannot be used in the governor\u2019s race or legislative races because of concerns it runs afoul of the Maine Constitution.\n\nDemocratic Gov.-elect Janet Mills said she intends to press for an amendment to the Maine Constitution so the system can be used in all elections. That would require a two-thirds vote of the Maine Legislature and another statewide vote.", "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.

There was no immediate comment from the Pakistani government.\n\nKhalilzad is on his second regional tour since being appointed, with stops in Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates as well as Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office. The insurgents say they met Khalilzad in Qatar last month.

They noted that Kim had not agreed to halt either nuclear weapons or missile development in negotiations with Trump or Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n\u201cThe fact that North Korea has continued to build nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in the midst of high-level diplomacy with China, South Korea and the U.S. should not come as a surprise,\u201d said Abraham Denmark, the Asia program director at The Wilson Center. \u201cDespite all the summitry, North Korea is just as dangerous today as it was a year ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cImproving relations with Pyongyang may be a laudable goal, but any claim that the North Korean nuclear and missile threats have been solved is either wishful thinking or purposefully deceptive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cInteresting but unsurprising report,\u201d said Kelsey Davenport, director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association. \u201cKim Jong Un only committed voluntarily to halt long-range missile tests.\u201d\n\nThe report was released less than a week after North Korea abruptly called off a new round of negotiations with Pompeo that had been set for Thursday in New York.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 At the Vatican\u2019s insistence, U.S. Catholic bishops abruptly postponed plans Monday to vote on proposed new steps to address the clergy sex abuse crisis roiling the church.\n\nCardinal Daniel DiNardo of Galveston-Houston, the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said he was told on the eve of the bishop\u2019s national meeting to delay action until after a Vatican-convened global meeting on sex abuse in February.\n\n\u201cWe are not ourselves happy about this,\u201d DiNardo told reporters in an unusual public display of frustration at a Vatican pronouncement.\n\n\u201cWe are working very hard to move to action \u2014 and we\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people in the church have a right to be skeptical. I think they also have a right to be hopeful.\u201d\n\nThe bishops are meeting through Wednesday in Baltimore and had been expected to consider several steps to combat abuse, including a new code of conduct for themselves and the creation of a special commission, including lay experts, to review complaints against the bishops.\n\nThe bishops plan to proceed with discussing these proposals, which were drafted in September by the bishops\u2019 Administrative Committee. Cardinal Blase J. Cupich, of Chicago, suggested the bishops could hold a non-binding vote on the proposals while in Baltimore and then convene a special assembly for a formal vote after considering the results of the global meeting in February.\n\n\u201cI realize that another meeting will create logistical challenges for the conference staff and the bishops\u2019 schedules, but there is a grave urgency to this matter and we cannot delay,\u201d Cupich said.\n\nAbuse scandals have roiled the Roman Catholic Church worldwide for decades, but there have been major developments this year in the U.S.\n\nIn July, Pope Francis removed U.S. church leader Theodore McCarrick as a cardinal after church investigators said an allegation that he groped a teenage altar boy in the 1970s was credible. Subsequently, several former seminarians and priests reported they too had been abused or harassed by McCarrick as adults, triggering debate over who might have known and covered up McCarrick\u2019s misconduct.\n\nIn August, a grand jury report in Pennsylvania detailed decades of abuse and cover-up in six dioceses, alleging more than 1,000 children had been abused over the years by about 300 priests. Since then, a federal prosecutor in Philadelphia has begun working on a federal criminal case centered on child exploitation, and attorneys general in several other states have launched investigations.\n\nDiNardo, in his address opening the bishops\u2019 assembly, told survivors of clergy abuse he was \u201cdeeply sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome would say this is entirely a crisis of the past. It is not,\u201d DiNardo said. \u201cWe must never victimize survivors over again by demanding they heal on our timeline.\u201d\n\nAfter DiNardo\u2019s address, the bishops adjourned to a chapel for a daylong session of prayer that includes remarks by two survivors of clergy abuse who have worked to promote healing and reconciliation among other victims.\n\n\u201cPlease understand the heart of the church is broken and you need to fix this now,\u2019\u201d Luis A. Torres Jr. told the bishops. \u201cYou were not called to be CEOs... You were not called to be princes. Be the priests that you were called to be. Please act now. Be better. Be good.\u201d\n\nOutside the conference hall, news of the delay in voting angered some protesters who were demanding the bishops take strong action against abuse.\n\n\u201cI know that they answer to the Holy See, but there\u2019s a bigger imperative here, which is that children and victims need them to step forward,\u201d said Anne Barrett Doyle, who works at the abuse database BishopAccountability.org. \u201cBy complying so meekly with what the pope has demanded of them today, they are surrendering their responsibility.\u201d\n\nLiz McCloskey, part of a coalition of concerned Catholics called the 5 Theses movement that has posted its proposals for reform on church doors in Baltimore and other cities, said the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. She said Catholics were \u201cleaving in droves\u201d in the absence of significant reforms and full transparency.\n\n\u201cDelaying taking any action in response to the sex abuse scandal is not only a public relations nightmare but a moral failing,\u201d McCloskey told The Associated Press.\n\nHer group\u2019s proposals for the bishops include cooperating fully with investigations and releasing names of credibly accused clergy, committing to shedding regalia and living simply, and asking Pope Francis to put women in leadership posts.\n\nDiNardo said the bishops didn\u2019t complete a final draft of their proposed anti-abuse actions until Oct. 30 and the Vatican, with relatively short notice, sought to delay voting because of potential legal complications.\n\nNonetheless, John Gehring, the Catholic program director at a Washington-based clergy network called Faith in Public Life, said the Vatican \u201cjust made a big mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe optics are terrible, and it sends a message, intended or not, that Rome doesn\u2019t recognize the urgency of the moment,\u201d Gehring tweeted .\n\n___\n\nCrary reported from New York.", "98-year-old veteran becomes first woman in VA Wall of Heroes\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 A 98-year-old Army nurse was honored as the first woman named to the VA Puget Sound Wall of Heroes.\n\nKIRO-TV reports Washington Gov.

Several thousand Central American migrants marked a month on the road Monday as they hitched rides to the western Mexico city of Guadalajara and toward the U.S. border. (AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd)\n\nGUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) \u2014 Several thousand Central American migrants heading for the U.S. border arrived in the western Mexico city of Guadalajara with help from truckers and other motorists Monday, marking a month since their trek began.\n\nMany of the migrants boarded waiting buses at the Jalisco state line that carried them to a shelter prepared for them in the city\u2019s Benito Juarez Auditorium. Guadalajara municipal police shuttled others in patrol vehicles.\n\nThe migrants are mostly families from Honduras. At the shelter, officials had the migrants form two lines \u2014 one for families and one for men traveling alone. They were offered food and told where to go for donated clothing and free internet to contact their families.\n\nMost appear intent on taking the Pacific coast route northward to the border city of Tijuana, which is still about 1,550 miles (2,500 kilometers) away. The migrants have come about 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) since they started out in Honduras around Oct. 13.\n\nWhile they previously suffered from the heat on their journey through Honduras, Guatemala and southern Mexico, they now trek along highways wrapped in blankets to fend off the morning chill.\n\nKaren Martinez of Copan, Honduras, and her three children bundled up with jackets, scarves and a blanket.\n\n\u201cSometimes we go along laughing, sometimes crying, but we keep on going,\u201d she said.\n\nBy late afternoon, the first migrants arrived on the outskirts of Guadalajara.\n\nWhile the caravan previously averaged only about 30 miles (50 kilometers) a day, the migrants are now covering daily distances of 185 miles (300 kilometers) or more, partly because they are relying on hitchhiking rather than walking.\n\nOn Monday morning, migrants gathered on a highway leading out of the central city of Irapuato looking for rides to Guadalajara about 150 miles (242 kilometers) away.\n\n\u201cNow the route is less complicated,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nIndeed, migrants have hopped aboard so many different kinds of trucks that they are no longer surprised by anything. Some have stacked themselves four levels high on a truck intended for pigs. On Monday, a few boarded a truck carrying a shipment of coffins, while yet others squeezed into a truck with narrow cages used for transporting chickens.\n\nMany, especially men, travel on open platform trailers used to transport steel and cars, or get in the freight containers of 18-wheelers and ride with one of the back doors open to provide air flow.\n\nThe practice is not without dangers. Earlier, a Honduran man in the caravan died when he fell from a platform truck in the Mexican state of Chiapas.\n\nJose Alejandro Caray, 17, of Yoro, Honduras, fell a week ago and injured his knee.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t bend it,\u201d Caray said as he watched other migrants swarm aboard tractor-trailers.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m afraid to get on,\u201d he said. \u201cI prefer to wait for a pickup truck.\u201d\n\nAfter several groups got lost after clambering on semi-trailers, caravan coordinators began encouraging migrants to ask drivers first or have someone ride in the cab so they could tell the driver where to turn off.\n\nOver the weekend, the central state of Queretaro reported 6,531 migrants moving through the state. A smaller caravan began arriving in Mexico City on Monday. By late afternoon, several hundred migrants had set up camp at the same sports complex the larger caravan left Saturday.\n\nThe caravan became a campaign issue in U.S. midterm elections and U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of over 5,000 military troops to the border to fend off the migrants. Trump has insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nMany say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum or work visas, and its government said Monday that 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them during the 45-day application process for more permanent status. It said about 533 migrants had requested a voluntary return to their countries.\n\nOn Monday, Mexican Interior Minister Alfonso Navarrete Prida met with other Cabinet members and the head of a business council to discuss job opportunities that could be offered to members of the caravan who decide to remain in Mexico.\n\nBut most migrants vow to continue to the United States.\n\nJose Tulio Rodriguez, 30, of Siguatepeque, Honduras, celebrated his 30th birthday at a migrant shelter in Mexico City last week before setting out with the rest of the caravan.\n\n\u201cThe distance between cities is longer\u201d than it was at the start, Rodriguez noted,\u201d but thanks to the people of Mexico, we haven\u2019t suffered.\u201d\n\nThose distances will get longer the farther they travel into northern Mexico, where towns of any size are often 250 miles (400 kilometers) apart.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Gerardo Carrillo contributed to this report.", "Fire crews clear rubble from the road near a building burned in the Camp Fire, Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, in Paradise, Calif.

If any place in the U.S. is well positioned to absorb 25,000 Amazon jobs, it may well be Crystal City which has lost nearly that many jobs over the last 15 years. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The communities said to be favored to become homes to a pair of big, new East Coast bases for Amazon are both riverfront stretches of major metropolitan areas with ample transportation and space for workers.\n\nBut there are plenty of differences between New York\u2019s Long Island City and Crystal City in northern Virginia.\n\nSet within eyeshot of the nation\u2019s capital, Crystal City is a thicket of 1980s-era office towers trying to plug into new economic energy after thousands of federal jobs moved elsewhere.\n\nRapidly growing Long Island City is an old manufacturing area already being reinvented as a hub for 21st-century industry, creativity and urbane living.\n\nSeattle-based Amazon, which set out last year to situate one additional headquarters but now may reportedly open two, has declined to comment on its plans. But people familiar with the talks said this week that Long Island City and Crystal City have emerged as front runners for the \u201cHQ2\u201d project and its total of 50,000 jobs.\n\nA look at two communities said to be at the top of Amazon\u2019s list.\n\nLONG ISLAND CITY\n\nIt\u2019s already the fastest-developing neighborhood in the nation\u2019s most populous city, and Amazon could pump up the volume in this buzzy part of Queens.\n\nIf chosen, the neighborhood stands to burnish New York City\u2019s reputation as a tech capital. Landing Amazon would also cement Long Island City\u2019s transformation from a faded manufacturing zone to a vibrant, of-the-moment enclave of waterfront skyscrapers, modernized warehouses and artsy-tech ambience across the East River from midtown Manhattan.\n\n\u201cI joke that we\u2019re experiencing explosive growth 30 years in the making,\u201d says Elizabeth Lusskin, president of the Long Island City Partnership, a neighborhood development group.\n\nBut Long Island City also has been straining to handle its growth.\n\nDays before the potential Amazon news emerged, the city announced a $180 million plan to address Long Island City\u2019s packed schools, street design and a sewage system that groans in heavy rain. But those projects will just catch up with current needs, says area City Councilman Jimmy van Bramer.\n\n\u201cI know that there are a lot of people cheerleading for this, but HQ2 has to work for Queens and the people of Queens. It can\u2019t just be good for Amazon,\u201d says van Bramer, a Democrat.\n\nOnce a bustling factory and freight-moving area, Long Island City saw many of its plants and warehouses closed as manufacturing shriveled in New York City.\n\nThe neighborhood\u2019s rebirth began in the 1980s, when officials broached redeveloping a swath of the waterfront, while artists were drawn by warehouse spaces, affordable rents and a building that is now the MoMA PS1 museum. Silvercup Studios \u2014 where such TV shows as \u201cSex and the City,\u201d \u203330 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d have been filmed \u2014 opened in 1983.\n\nLong Island City gained a new commercial stature, and the start of a high-rise skyline, when the banking giant now called Citi opened an office tower there in 1989. But the area\u2019s growth lately has been driven by residential building.\n\nSome 9,150 new apartments and homes have been built since 2010, more than in any other New York City neighborhood, according to the city Planning Department . Thousands more units are in the works.\n\nNew York has striven for nearly a decade to position itself as a tech hotspot.\n\nVenture capitalists poured $5.8 billion into New York-area startups last quarter, more than any other region except the San Francisco area, according to the consulting and accounting firm PwC . Established tech giants, including Google and Facebook, have been expanding their New York footprints.\n\nStill, landing HQ2 would represent \u201cincredible validation of just how far New York has come,\u201d says Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the Center for an Urban Future think tank.\n\nWaiting for a subway, Long Island City community board chairwoman Denise Keehan-Smith could envision Amazon benefiting the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cBut I think we have to be careful about it,\u201d she said.\n\nCRYSTAL CITY\n\nIf any place in America can absorb 25,000 Amazon jobs without disruption, it may well be Crystal City, Virginia, where nearly that many jobs have vanished over the last 15 years.\n\nThe neighborhood in Arlington County is bounded by the Potomac River and the nation\u2019s capital on one side, by the Pentagon on another and Reagan National Airport on a third.\n\nDespite its prime location and abundant transportation options, the neighborhood has been hit by a massive outflow of jobs. The Patent and Trademark Office began moving more than 7,000 jobs out of Crystal City in 2003. In 2005, the Defense Department announced plans to move roughly 17,000 jobs elsewhere as part of a base realignment.\n\nArlington County has worked hard to bring in new employers, and had some success. The Public Broadcasting Service moved its headquarters to Crystal City in 2006.\n\nStill, large swaths of the neighborhood remain vacant. Among other challenges, the area has fought to overcome a reputation for outdated architecture.\n\nCrystal City is populated by \u201970s and \u201980s-era office buildings. The buildings are connected by a network of tunnels populated with food-court style dining options, hair salons and newsstands. The tunnels leave the ground-level outdoor streetscape sometimes looking empty.\n\nBrookings Institution urban planner Jenny Schuetz suggested the buildings may require an upgrade, or even replacement. But she noted that while people often associate tech companies with converted lofts or state-of-the art workspaces, many big Silicon Valley tech companies actually work out of \u201980s-era office buildings.\n\nFor all the talk about antiquated architecture, people who\u2019ve actually worked in Crystal City appreciate its convenience and its worker-friendly features, including the tunnels.\n\n\u201cI loved it here,\u201d said Christine Gentry of Greenbelt, Maryland, as she ate breakfast in a largely empty food court. She works for the Patent and Trademark Office and preferred the days when her office was in Crystal City.\n\n\u201cEverything is accessible here,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it was raining or snowing or sleeting, I never had to go out.\u201d\n\nPerhaps no place better illustrates the vibe of Crystal City than the region\u2019s only revolving restaurant, the Skydome atop the Doubletree Crystal City. Diners enjoy a panoramic view of the D.C. skyline, completing a full rotation every 47 minutes.\n\nSam Getachew, the hotel\u2019s food and beverage manager, said the restaurant fits the neighborhood\u2019s retro atmosphere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge draw,\u201d Getchew said. \u201cPeople come for the curiosity of it.\u201d\n\nThe only downside, he said, is that \u201cwhen customers get up to go to the restroom, they don\u2019t know where they are when they come back.\u201d\n\n___\n\nBarakat reported from Crystal City, Virginia.", "SPARTANBURG, S.C.

(AP) \u2014 When Roy Williams pulled Luke Maye late in the first half for taking a bad shot, the Atlantic Coast Conference\u2019s preseason player of the year didn\u2019t pout or get angry on the bench.\n\nMaye instead responded with a solid second half, scoring a game-high 24 points as No. 8 North Carolina defeated Wofford 78-67 on Tuesday to avenge an upset loss last year to the Terriers.\n\n\u201cCoach does a great job of treating everybody equally and not playing favorites,\u201d said Maye, who finished 7 of 13 from the field and 8 of 9 from the foul line. \u201cHe wants to make sure people understand when they are making a mistake. That\u2019s the biggest thing he prides himself on and I love him for it.\u201d\n\nMaye was solid throughout, and Cameron Johnson provided a huge spark in the second half as the Tar Heels improved to 15-1 in season openers under Williams.\n\nAfter Wofford battled back to tie the game at 46 with 10:33 left on a pair of 3-pointers from sharpshooter Fletcher Magee, Johnson buried three 3s in a span of three minutes to put the Tar Heels ahead for good. Johnson finished 5 of 7 from beyond the arc and had 17 points and eight rebounds.\n\nJohnson said he had this game circled on his calendar. The Pittsburgh transfer\u2019s first game in a Tar Heels uniform last season following a knee injury came against Wofford, and it didn\u2019t go well.\n\n\u201cThat broke my heart,\u201d said Johnson, who displayed a confident stroke on his long jumpers. \u201cSo I have been eyeing this game for a very long time. This is one I really wanted.\u201d\n\nIt was the seventh time overall that Johnson has knocked in five or more 3-pointers. He\u2019s done it three times since joining North Carolina.\n\nGarrison Brooks added a career-high 20 points for North Carolina and Kenny Williams was solid defensively, making things extremely difficult for Magee in the first half.\n\nWofford was hoping for another upset.\n\nThe Terriers visited Chapel Hill last December and stunned No. 6 UNC 79-75 behind 27 points from Magee, the Southern Conference\u2019s 2017-18 player of the year. This time the Tar Heels invaded the 3,400-seat Jerry Richardson Indoor Stadium, which opened in 2017, and pulled away late in the second half.\n\nMagee finished with 21 points despite missing his first seven shots and not scoring until late in the first half. Wofford shot just 9 of 35 from 3-point range.\n\n\u201cWe missed a lot of shots,\u201d Wofford coach Mike Young said.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nWofford: The Terriers proved (again) they can play with the nation\u2019s best. They can take heart in knowing that most of the teams they will play in the Southern Conference don\u2019t have as much length as North Carolina. The future is bright for a team that returns most of its players from last season and is picked to finish second in the Southern Conference.\n\nCam is HUNGRY \ud83d\udcaa pic.twitter.com/BPqNm3McM5 \u2014 Wofford Basketball (@WoffordMBB) November 7, 2018\n\nNorth Carolina: One of the biggest questions for the Tar Heels is who will replace Joel Berry at point guard. Freshman Coby White got the start and struggled early on with two turnovers but turned it on down the stretch, making a key 3-pointer from the corner while converting a couple of drives. He finished with eight points and three assists. \u201cI just had first-game jitters,\u201d White said. Seventh Woods backed up White and had two points and three assists. Williams said that other than a few turnovers, he was pleased with both of his point guards. \u201cBoth of them will play,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIf I were a football coach I would play two quarterbacks every game, too.\u201d\n\nCAREER HIGH: Along with posting a career high 20 points, Brooks \u2014 who started at the forward spot opposite Maye \u2014 earned a distinction of being the only Tar Heel player not to get yelled at by his coach at halftime. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason he\u2019s getting to start,\u201d Williams said.\n\nBrooks said he was motivated by UNC\u2019s loss last year to Wofford. \u201cI take everything personal,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cIf you want to win, you want to be the best, you have to take it personal.\u201d\n\nINJURY SCARE: Kenny Williams left holding his right shoulder late in the game but did return. Roy Williams said the senior guard had full range of motion in the shoulder so he sent him back in.

(AP Photo/Lalo R. Villar)\n\nMADRID (AP) \u2014 With experience and beautiful goals, Karim Benzema has been leading the way for Real Madrid as it continues to impress under coach Santiago Solari.\n\nBenzema has been key since Solari took over from the fired Julen Lopetegui two weeks ago and revamped Madrid. The veteran French striker scored four goals in the four victories under Solari, helping the team get back on track in the Spanish league and in the Champions League.\n\nGiven a leading role in the attack, Benzema has thrived, showing some of what made him an indisputable starter for France\u2019s national team a few years ago. His technique has been as sharp as ever, as is his accuracy in front of the goal. He has been dribbling past defenders with ease and his positioning inside the area has been spotless.\n\nBenzema, 30, has scored some great goals in his recent run, including in the match at Celta Vigo on Sunday, when Madrid won 4-2 to get within four points of Spanish league leader Barcelona.\n\nBenzema opened the scoring after a neat touch to control the ball inside the area, getting into perfect position to find the net. He was also responsible for the team\u2019s second goal after using two nifty moves to fool a defender inside the box. He sent the ball through his opponent\u2019s legs before firing a shot that struck the post and ricocheted off another defender before going in, counting as an own goal. Benzema also struck the crossbar in the match in Vigo.\n\n\u201cHis first goal was spectacular and he also created the second one,\u201d Solari said. \u201cHe gave us game, created spaces and even worked well on defense. He had a very complete match.\u201d\n\nBenzema had already impressed with a great goal in Madrid\u2019s 5-0 rout of Viktoria Plzen in the Champions League, clearing three defenders with a series of cut-back moves inside the area. He also scored with a header in that match, which left Madrid back at the top of its group along with Roma.\n\nBenzema started the season playing well in the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo, scoring five goals in Madrid\u2019s first four matches. He and Gareth Bale were thriving as starters, but Madrid hit a slump under Lopetegui, the goals stopped coming and Madrid eventually reached its worst scoring drought ever, leading to Lopetegui\u2019s firing.\n\nBecause rules prohibit a club from having an interim coach for longer than two weeks, Madrid had to register Solari as Lopetegui\u2019s full-time replacement on Monday. Solari, a former Madrid player, has become a leading candidate for the job after his great start, but the club still hasn\u2019t said whether it has stopped looking for Lopetegui\u2019s replacement.\n\nBenzema has made 81 appearances for France but hasn\u2019t played since October 2015, when he was suspected of being involved in an extortion scam over a sex tape featuring former international teammate Mathieu Valbuena.\n\nDespite having scored 202 goals for Madrid, Benzema was among the players criticized by fans and local media during the team\u2019s difficult stretch under Lopetegui, the former Spain coach.\n\n\u201cI play football to make history,\u201d Benzema said after the win against Viktoria Plzen. \u201cSometimes people don\u2019t really understand what I do on the pitch. I\u2019m there to help my teammates as well as score goals. For me, the important thing always is winning.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni", "Death toll in Jordan flood up to 13 after girl\u2019s body found\n\nJordanian rescue teams search,Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018 for missing people in the Madaba area, south of the capital of Amman, after flash floods unleashed by heavy rain a day earlier killed at least 12 people.

November 7, 2018\n\nLet\u2019s bridge the urban-rural divide and find cooperative solutions to Nebraska\u2019a challenges\n\nRepublicans have made voter registration gains in Nebraska\u2019s rural counties while Democrats have achieved gains in Omaha and Lincoln, The World-Herald reported last week. This development raises concern that Nebraska may see an increase in rural-urban tensions in the future, given the disdain the two parties often display toward each other.\n\nNebraskans need to make sure this partisan divide doesn\u2019t encourage a wider urban-rural divide in the state.\n\nThe two political parties are increasingly polarized in their ideological stances, and it\u2019s common to see partisans depict the opposing party as a dangerous threat to the country. Lowering the political temperature and bridging the partisan divide through constructive agreement has become increasingly difficult.\n\nIt\u2019s fully legitimate for politically interested people to hold fast to their principles and values, but Nebraskans, urban and rural, should also recognize the crucial need to work together. Otherwise, the state\u2019s efforts to address its challenges could run aground.\n\nA central example is an overhaul of tax policy to address the public\u2019s loud demands for property tax relief. Another example: the distribution of state aid to K-12 education. Those are complex, difficult issues, and they can\u2019t be addressed in a serious way unless Nebraskans, urban and rural, are willing to work together on the needed compromises.\n\nThe state needs leaders \u2014 in government and the business and nonprofit communities \u2014 who promote statewide solidarity and cooperative solutions.\n\nThe University of Nebraska has a vital role in promoting connections between urban and rural residents. NU makes impressive contributions in that regard through its programs on agriculture, natural resources science, training in the health care professions, entrepreneurship and the Rural Futures Institute.\n\nThe business community, including chambers of commerce, can play an important role. It\u2019s been encouraging in the past, for example, to see Omaha business leaders visit western Nebraska, and vice versa, as part of such relationship-building.\n\nHow the Nebraska Legislature addresses urban-rural issues will be especially consequential. The 2020 Census numbers will likely mean an increase in urban seats in the Legislature and a decrease in rural ones.\n\nUrban-rural frictions on some issues are inevitable as lawmakers advocate for their districts\u2019 interests. But state senators who stoke resentment across urban-rural lines undercut the state\u2019s ability to get things done. Lawmakers who encourage mutual respect and cooperative solutions serve the best interests of their district and the state as a whole.\n\nThere\u2019s a lesson in that for all Nebraskans. The challenges on issues such as taxes and school aid are difficult enough without letting urban-rural frictions get in the way of finding solutions. We need to move forward together.\n\n_______\n\nKearney Hub.

Turnout in Buffalo County was almost 55 percent \u2014 a very good showing compared to recent elections when participation barely exceeded 30 percent.\n\nBuffalo County\u2019s turnout on Tuesday was commendable, but voters showed up at the polls in exceptional numbers in many other locales. A total of 38 counties had 60-percent to 69-percent turnout, while six counties eclipsed 70 percent. They were: Arthur, Garden, Harlan, Merrick, Morrill and McPherson counties.\n\nThe state\u2019s best turnout was McPherson County\u2019s 78 percent. That\u2019s phenomenal.\n\nTrump backers\n\nNebraska voters were strong supporters of candidate Donald Trump in 2016, and on Tuesday in what was billed as a referendum on President Trump\u2019s performance in his first two years in the White House, Nebraskans again supported him \u2014 or at least the Republican slate of candidates who aligned themselves with the president.\n\nOne of those Trump beneficiaries, Gov. Pete Ricketts, talked tough on immigration in the past two weeks and said he is poised to send more National Guard members to the Mexico border if called upon to head off illegal entry from the caravan of 7,000 Central American refugees slowly marching its way toward the United States.\n\nNebraskans rewarded Ricketts with nearly 60 percent of the votes vs. Democrat challenger Bob Krist\u2019s 40 percent. Similarly, U.S. Senate incumbent Deb Fischer got 58 percent vs. Democrat Jane Raybould\u2019s 38 percent. U.S. House incumbent Adrian Smith landed almost 77 percent of the votes cast in his 75-county 3rd District vs. Democrat challenger Paul Theobald\u2019s 23 percent.\n\nAuditor apologizes\n\nVoters gave incumbent State Auditor Charlie Janssen another four years in spite of news reports he wasn\u2019t in his office the balance of many workdays. Instead, he spent multiple long three-hour lunch breaks sipping beer in a sports bar south of the State Capitol.\n\nWisely, Janssen admitted the news reports about his behavior were accurate. He apologized and promised to try harder to be a good state auditor. Janssen did the right thing by admitting the mistake and saying he was sorry. Too bad other politicians find it so difficult to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry and won\u2019t do it again.\u201d\n\n______\n\nLincoln Journal Star. November 7, 2018\n\nWith election over, it\u2019s time to move on, work together\n\nBreathe a sigh of relief, Nebraska - we survived the 2018 election.\n\nNow, let\u2019s learn from it and become better on account of what we all just endured.\n\nTo be frank, this campaign hasn\u2019t necessarily brought out our better angels. A flood of negative ads, some emanating from unknown sources, sought to denigrate viewpoints and people on the other side of the topic. Half-truths and claims that required squinting to find an ounce of accuracy abounded.\n\nAnd for what? The pursuit of victory above all else?\n\nMoving forward from Tuesday, we must bury the hatchet and seek common ground to shape and advance our political dialogue and policy. Truth, compassion and community are needed to lead the way, rather than the win-at-all-costs mentality and scorched-earth tactics that led up to the vote.\n\nYou\u2019ll probably notice we identified neither the victor nor the vanquished, as the editorial page was finalized before all the returns had been counted. But that further underscores the point of this call to unity - which remains salient, no matter which party or candidates are in power.\n\nIn fact, those who are elected, whether to a county board or Congress, take upon themselves the sacred duty to represent all their constituents. Not just the ones who voted for them or think like them - we\u2019re talking the whole lot.\n\nPerhaps this all seems a bit idealistic. After all, a win is a win, whether it\u2019s by one vote or 100,000 votes, and all elections have consequences. But those ramifications don\u2019t have to include highlighting or capitalizing upon the divides, nor should gloating occur at the expense of those who backed an unsuccessful campaign.\n\nNo compelling reason exists as to why we can\u2019t be better as a result of this election. Rather than viewing it solely through a lens of wins and losses and us vs. them, let us offer a suggestion that may sound foreign: Step back, and be collegial.\n\nIf you\u2019re a politically active person, no doubt you\u2019ll have already been inundated by now with post-election fundraising emails for some candidate or cause. Just press pause.\n\nThe issues won\u2019t have gone anywhere in the interim. But, after such a contentious and momentous midterm election, taking a second to unwind and chill out won\u2019t hurt anyone. Rather, a quick break is important to recalibrate ourselves to what matters most - policy and people, not politics.\n\nWhen the votes are counted and winners determined, we hope an ability to work together - to give a little bit to get a piece of something instead of the entirety of nothing - is the lasting legacy of this election, not the philosophical divides campaigns sought to exploit.\n\n___\n\nMcCook Daily Gazette. November 7, 2018\n\nDespite personal preferences, all Americans won\n\nDespite the scoreboard, elections are not a zero-sum game.\n\nYes, the Democrats took control of the House by taking away seats from the Republicans, and the Republicans maintained control of the Senate by taking away a couple of seats from the Democrats.\n\nA Republican governor won re-election and a U.S. Senator held on to her seat, but Nebraska voters embraced, by a narrow margin, one of the major points of Obamacare, Initiative 427, expansion of Medicaid.\n\nA female Democrat was elected governor of Kansas, which also elected a gay Native American woman to Congress.\n\nTwo-thirds of the states have now legalized some sort of marijuana, the latest medical marijuana in Utah and Missouri and recreational in Michigan, but North Dakota rejected the recreational use of pot.\n\nA Furnas County sheriff was defeated by a write-in candidate, but two incumbent McCook City Council members were re-elected, and a young local businessman won a seat vacated by an incumbent who chose not to run again.\n\nThere are certainly many other local, state and national races of note, and we\u2019re still sorting out the deluge of results and implications.\n\nBut the most important results are already apparent \u2014 56 percent of eligible Nebraska voters turned out to make their choices, 54 percent voted in Red Willow County and other area counties had similar results.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame the numbers aren\u2019t closer to 100 percent, but they\u2019re still far above numbers for other recent elections.\n\nAmericans should be celebrating a process that forces government to address their concerns, rather than mourning defeat of their favorite candidate or issue. And, they should channel the energy that propelled them to the voting booth into staying involved in the political process, and not just for the next election.\n\nImplementation of Medicaid expansion in Nebraska is an example of an issue that bears watching, and making voices heard, as it works its way through the Legislature to the governor\u2019s desk.\n\nResponsibility for the changes that result from that vote, as well as other issues and candidates, fall on all of us in the coming years.\n\n___", "Des Moines Register. November 7, 2018\n\nReynolds should work to be the governor of all Iowans\n\nIowa has elected its first female governor. That is certainly historic, and we congratulate Gov. Kim Reynolds on her accomplishment.\n\nReynolds, a Republican who previously held the job by appointment, was chosen to lead this state by a slim majority of voters.\n\nReynolds should remember that slim majority going forward. Nearly half of Iowa voters supported her challenger, Democrat Fred Hubbell. And in two congressional districts, Iowans turned out to remove from office two Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nReynolds should not ignore the deep political divisions in this state. She must work to be the governor for all Iowans. That means reaching across the aisle. It means listening to dissenters. It means borrowing good ideas from Democrats. It means abandoning a radical agenda on abortion, workers\u2019 rights and tax cuts.\n\nAnd it means finally outlining her own vision for the future, something she didn\u2019t do during the campaign.\n\nSince taking over as governor, Reynolds has not become her own woman separate from her predecessor, former Gov. Terry Branstad. During her campaign, she failed to outline a comprehensive agenda. Now that she has become the governor in her own right, she needs to begin governing in her own right.\n\n______\n\nFort Dodge Messenger. November 10, 2018.\n\nTake the campaign signs down now\n\nThey have served their purpose, but now are just clutter\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the Nov. 6 General Election signs and posters touting various candidates and causes began to appear in yards and vacant lots, on lampposts and in just about any spot where they might catch the eye of passers-by. While the clutter could be viewed as offensive from a strictly aesthetic standpoint, there\u2019s another perspective. The multitude of advocacy statements reflects the vibrancy of our political system and thus was a thing of beauty to anyone who treasures our democracy.\n\nThat was then.\n\nThe election is over.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that signs might stay up briefly post-election constituting something of a victory lap for the winners and a defiant statement of resolve to persevere and prevail on some future election day by those who came up short. The time is now at hand, however, for those politically engaged people who put up the signs to show respect for their fellow citizens by removing them. What were initially a testament to democracy will soon be out-of-place eyesores.\n\nGood citizenship now requires that the signs come down within the next few days.\n\n___\n\nQuad-City Times. November 8, 2018\n\nIowa has record night\n\nFour years ago Iowa shared the embarrassing distinction, with Mississippi and Vermont, of never having sent a woman to Congress.\n\nNor had we ever elected a woman governor.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, broke the congressional barrier in 2014. And Tuesday night, Gov. Kim Reynolds became the first woman elected by Iowa voters to be the state\u2019s chief executive.\n\nReynolds who became governor after Terry Branstad left to join the Trump administration, defeated Democrat Fred Hubbell on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Cindy Axne and state Rep. Abby Finkenauer, both Democrats, swept into office with solid victories over U.S. Reps. David Young and Rod Blum.\n\nAxne and Finkenauer will become the first women from Iowa ever to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nWith their wins, now half of Iowa\u2019s congressional delegation will be made up of women. And with Reynolds\u2019 victory, women will continue to occupy some of the top spots in state government.\n\nSpeaker Linda Upmeyer presides over the House while Sen. Janet Peterson is the leader of Democrats in the Senate.\n\nTaken together, this is a remarkable turnaround for a state that went 168 years without sending a woman to Washington, D.C.\n\nMake no mistake, there is still a good-old-boy network in state government. The shameful harassment of Kirsten Anderson is proof of that. Not to mention the actions by former Iowa Finance Authority Director Dave Jamison. And we have yet to see how Democrats will handle the return of Sen. Nate Boulton, the Des Moines Democrat who dropped out of his party\u2019s gubernatorial primary last year after allegations of sexual misconduct prior to his election surfaced.\n\nPetersen pledged a full investigation if Boulton didn\u2019t resign from the Senate, and he refused to do so.\n\nStill, Tuesday night seems to have been a turning point for Iowa, and not just in the high profile races we mentioned.\n\nThe Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa State University reported Wednesday that 45 women will serve in the state legislature next year, a record. Women will now make up 30 percent of the legislature, the center says.\n\nAmong the new lawmakers will be Chris Cournoyer, a Republican who won in Senate District 49, which includes Clinton County and part of Scott County. Re-elected Tuesday, without opposition, also were area state Reps. Cindy Winckler, Monica Kurth and Phyllis Thede, all Democrats.\n\n____\n\nDubuque Telegraph Herald. November 7, 2018\n\nAttorney general right to open probe\n\nThree months after his counterpart in Pennsylvania released a chilling grand-jury report exposing cover-ups concerning 300 \u201cpredator priests\u201d in that state, and after saying he lacked the authority to do likewise, Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller has come around.\n\nMiller last week announced that his office is gathering information about clergy abuse in Iowa and \u201cexamining our options.\u201d Miller, a Dubuque native and product of Catholic schools, said in a statement he is \u201cappalled by the cases of abuse and cover-up uncovered by the Pennsylvania investigation, as well as cases in Iowa that have gone unreported.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not alone.\n\nDespite years of revelations, millions of dollars in settlements, victims\u2019 incalculable anguish and promises of transparency and accountability \u2014 this, after decades of scandalous cover-ups \u2014 the Catholic Church still isn\u2019t quite getting it.\n\nRyan J. Foley, of The Associated Press, recently inquired of officials of the diocese of Sioux City about sexual abuse committed by a now-retired parish priest. They only then conceded that, yes, they had concealed the fact that the Rev. Jerome Coyle, now 85, years ago admitted sexually abusing some 50 children over a 20-year period.\n\nApparently, the Church\u2019s longstanding, outrageous response to sexual assault and abuse within its ranks \u2014 denial, coverup and reassignment of perpetrators \u2014 is not entirely a thing of the past.\n\nBy the way, the Sioux City diocese recently helped place Coyle in a Fort Dodge retirement home, a facility across the street from \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a school. It should surprise no one that the diocese didn\u2019t mention Coyle\u2019s presence to administrators at the school, which happens to be a Catholic institution. (The AP story published, and Coyle was swiftly relocated.)\n\nUnlike other dioceses, including the Archdiocese of Dubuque, which itself has paid nearly $14 million in settlements with victims, the Sioux City diocese has never listed priests who have been credibly accused of abuse. Still waiting for transparency over there.\n\nIt\u2019s positive that Miller says he will do what he can \u2014 even if it might not result in prosecutions due to the statute of limitations and limitations on his authority. For example, he does not have the power to launch a statewide investigative grand jury such as the one in Pennsylvania.\n\nHowever, Miller has put the Church on notice \u2014 that he expects all church officials \u201cto comply with the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s request to preserve documents related to abuse and personnel.\u201d He has met with Bishop Richard Pates, of the Diocese of Des Moines, and said he plans to meet with the other bishops and the archbishop in Iowa. Meanwhile, his staff has met with some abuse survivors.\n\nIn this space two months ago, we stated, \u201cIf the Catholic Church is to get past this, it must impel all those complicit in any cover-up to step down.\u201d (bit.ly/2yUgZfz)\n\nMaybe we were getting ahead of ourselves. Before getting to that point, all Church officials, coast to coast and around the world, need to come clean about this abhorrent pattern of abuse. The Sioux City diocese is an appropriate place to start.\n\n____", "HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 A court fight over first responders\u2019 DNA has broken out in the case of a black Connecticut lawyer found shot to death in his overturned SUV.\n\nThe lawyer\u2019s father, Dr. Abraham Dabela, has accused police of covering up a murder. But police said evidence points to the death being a suicide.\n\nThe police officers and firefighters in Redding are trying to fend off an attempt to collect samples of their DNA by Dr. Dabela, who is trying to determine the source of unknown DNA found on the trigger of his son\u2019s gun at the crash site.\n\nGugsa Abraham \u201cAbe\u201d Dabela, 35, was found shot in the head in his crashed Mercedes SUV near his home in Redding shortly after 1:30 a.m. on April 5, 2014. His blood-alcohol level was nearly 2.5 times the legal limit for driving, police said. Police said he died of what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot, and the medical examiner\u2019s office ruled the death a suicide. A prosecutor concluded there was no evidence of a homicide.\n\nPolice and firefighters submitted DNA samples about a year after Dabela\u2019s death, and state crime lab tests excluded them as the source of DNA found on the gun. But Keith Altman, one of Dr. Dabela\u2019s attorneys, said it was recently discovered that three firefighters who were at the scene did not submit DNA samples.\n\nDabela had been intimidated by Redding firefighters at a local bar a few weeks before his death, Dr. Dabela\u2019s lawyers said.\n\nThe police investigation has drawn heavy criticism from the state NAACP chapter, which has been doing its own review of the death in the affluent, mostly white suburb of Redding.\n\nDr. Dabela is suing Redding police officials in federal court in Hartford over their handling of the investigation. Police officials, including former Redding Chief Douglas Fuchs, deny allegations in the lawsuit that they rushed to a suicide judgment and failed to adequately investigate the younger Dabela\u2019s death because he was black.\n\nThe elder Dabela, a medical doctor in Maryland, has subpoenaed several police officers and firefighters to submit DNA samples for an independent analysis. Lawyers for the first responders have filed a motion to quash the subpoenas. A hearing about the subpoenas is scheduled for Dec. 13 before federal Magistrate Judge Donna Martinez.\n\n\u201cAs long as I live, I\u2019m not going to let this thing die without reaching a conclusion,\u201d Dr. Dabela said. \u201cI\u2019m seeking, and I shall gain, the truth. I knew my son for 35 years ... and my son is not going to kill himself because he had a very bright future. It appears to me that either the police killed him and they want to hide it, or they know the killer and they want to hide it.\u201d\n\nDr. Dabela\u2019s lawyers have raised many questions, including why his son\u2019s DNA was not found on the gun\u2019s trigger or the bullet that killed him and why there was a footprint on his back. Tests show there was DNA of an unknown person on the trigger, they said.\n\n\u201cEverything they\u2019ve done has been used to confirm the finding of suicide,\u201d Altman said.\n\nThe younger Dabela also once had a dispute with Fuchs, the police chief, over obtaining a gun permit, Dr. Dabela\u2019s lawyers said. Fuchs retired as chief in July amid another lawsuit over his handling of a 2016 suicide.\n\nAttorneys for Redding police deny Dr. Dabela\u2019s claims and say first responders shouldn\u2019t have to submit their DNA again because it already has been collected and analyzed.", "CHARLESTON, S.C.

(AP Photo/Jean-Francois Badias)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday became the first Western leader to acknowledge his country had heard recordings of the killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\u201cCanada has been fully briefed up on what Turkey had to share,\u201d Trudeau said from Paris, where he was attending the Peace Forum following the World War I armistice centenary.\n\nHis comments come just two days after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he had given recordings \u201cto Saudi Arabia, to America, to the Germans, the French, to the British, to all of them.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian leader is the first since that announcement to officially confirm that his country\u2019s intelligence had listened to the audio as Canada\u2019s intelligence agencies continue to work \u201cvery closely\u201d with Turkish intelligence on Khashoggi\u2019s killing.\n\nTrudeau said that he himself had not heard the shared audio, which is the latest move by Turkey to maintain international pressure on Saudi Arabia to stop a cover up of the Oct. 2 killing.\n\nHe declined to give any details on the contents of the tapes.\n\nTrudeau also said he thanked Erdogan in person for \u201chis strength in responding to the Khashoggi situation\u201d when the two leaders met in Paris this weekend.\n\nThe cooperation between the two countries comes at a rocky moment. In an unrelated diplomatic spat, Canada in August criticized the arrests of Saudi women\u2019s rights activists. In response, Saudi Arabia ordered the Canadian ambassador to leave the kingdom and froze all new business between the two countries.\n\nFrance\u2019s account somewhat differed on Erdogan\u2019s claim to have shared the audio.\n\nWhen questioned on France 2 Television Monday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said that Turkey has \u201cnot to my knowledge\u201d given the French government any such recordings, and suggested the Turks were playing games.\n\n\u201cIf the Turkish president has information to give to us, he must give it to us... That means he is playing a political game in this situation,\u201d Le Drian said.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu accused his French counterpart of \u201cimpertinence\u201d and said Turkish officials had shared \u201call information\u201d with France\u2019s intelligence on Oct. 24.\n\nGoing further, Cavusoglu suggested that Le Drian may be trying to cover-up the killing so as not to endanger agreements with Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cNo one should be surprised if soon they begin to deny the murder that even Saudi Arabia accepted,\u201d Cavusoglu said. \u201cWho has recently reached which agreement \u2014 this should be carefully looked into.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cAre they trying to cover up this murder?

We are following these.\u201d\n\nCIA Director Gina Haspel, who visited Turkey last month for information on the investigation, is reported to have heard the recordings, the existence of which was leaked to the media but never openly confirmed until Saturday.\n\nAlso Monday, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was in Saudi Arabia where he met King Salman and was expected to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nHunt \u2014 the first British minister to visit Saudi Arabia since Khashoggi was killed \u2014 said he would press the kingdom to fully cooperate with a Turkish investigation into the writer\u2019s killing.\n\n\u201cThe international community remain united in horror and outrage at the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi one month ago. It is clearly unacceptable that the full circumstances behind his murder still remain unclear,\u201d Hunt said in a statement ahead of landing in Riyadh.\n\nA statement by the state-run Saudi News Agency did not make any references to Khashoggi, saying only that King Salman and Hunt discussed bilateral relations and the latest developments in the region.\n\nOn Sunday U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke with the Saudi crown prince on the telephone and \u201cemphasized that the United States will hold all of those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi accountable, and that Saudi Arabia must do the same.\u201d\n\nThe crown prince is widely suspected of at least having knowledge of the killing, which involved some members of his security entourage. Khashoggi was a Washington Post columnist and a critic of the crown prince who was living in self-imposed exile before his death.\n\nUnder mounting pressure, Saudi Arabia has changed its narrative about Khashoggi\u2019s killing, first saying that he walked out of the embassy the day he disappeared before eventually acknowledging Khashoggi died inside the consulate. Saudi Arabia has also recently acknowledged Turkish evidence that showed the slaying was premeditated.\n\nTurkey says a 15-member Saudi assassination squad strangled and dismembered Khashoggi at the consulate.

Pabst Brewing Company and MillerCoors are heading to trial starting Monday, Nov. 12, to settle a contract dispute in which Pabst accuses the brewing giant of trying to undermine its competitor by breaking a contract to make their products. (AP Photo/Ivan Moreno)\n\nMILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 Pabst Brewing Company and MillerCoors are going to trial, with hipster favorite Pabst contending that MillerCoors wants to put it out of business by ending a longstanding partnership through which it brews Pabst\u2019s beers.\n\nThe case has high stakes for Pabst, whose lawyers argue that the company\u2019s very existence relies on the partnership with Chicago-based MillerCoors, which produces, packages and ships nearly all its products, which include Pabst Blue Ribbon, Old Milwaukee, Natty Boh and Lone Star. MillerCoors, meanwhile, says it\u2019s not obligated to continue brewing for Pabst and that Pabst doesn\u2019t want to pay enough to justify doing so.\n\nThe trial in Milwaukee County Circuit Court begins Monday and is scheduled through Nov. 30.\n\nPabst\u2019s attorneys have said in court documents and hearings that MillerCoors LLC is lying about its brewing capacity to break away from Pabst and capture its share of the cheap beer market by disrupting Pabst\u2019s ability to compete. At a March hearing in which MillerCoors tried to have the lawsuit dismissed, Pabst attorney Adam Paris said \u201cstunning documents\u201d obtained from MillerCoors show that it went as far as hiring a consultant to \u201cfigure out ways to get rid of us.\u201d MillerCoors has called that a mischaracterization of the consultant\u2019s work.\n\nThe 1999 agreement between MillerCoors and Pabst, which was founded in Milwaukee in 1844 but is now headquartered in Los Angeles, expires in 2020 but provides for two possible five-year extensions. The companies dispute how the extensions should be negotiated: MillerCoors argues that it has sole discretion to determine whether it can continue brewing for Pabst, whereas Pabst says the companies must work \u201cin good faith\u201d to find a solution if Pabst wants to extend the agreement but MillerCoors lacks the capacity.\n\nPabst needs 4 million to 4.5 million barrels brewed annually and claims MillerCoors is its only option. It is seeking more than $400 million in damages and for MillerCoors to be ordered to honor its contract.\n\nDuring 2015 negotiations about extending the contract, MillerCoors announced it would close its brewing facility in Eden, North Carolina, and that it eventually might have to shutter another facility in Irwindale, California. Pabst contends that MillerCoors refused to provide any information to substantiate its claim that it would no longer have the capacity to continue brewing Pabst\u2019s beers, and that it wouldn\u2019t consider leasing the Eden facility and would only sell it for an \u201castronomical\u201d price.\n\nPabst says MillerCoors wouldn\u2019t agree to an extension unless Pabst paid $45 per barrel \u2014 \u201ca commercially devastating, near-triple price increase\u201d from what it pays now. At the March hearing, Paris said MillerCoors knew Pabst couldn\u2019t accept that proposal \u201cbecause it would have bankrupted us three times over.\u201d\n\nIn court filings, MillersCoors said Pabst\u2019s proposals to keep the Eden facility open \u201cwere commercially unreasonable\u201d and that Pabst sought \u201ca windfall through litigation\u201d instead of offering to pay enough to keep a facility open. It also said the facility\u2019s closing was \u201cto ensure the longer-term sustainability\u201d of MillerCoors because thousands of new brewers have entered the market over the past decade.\n\nMillerCoors and Anheuser-Busch, which have the biggest U.S. market share at 24.8 percent and 41.6 percent, respectively, have been losing business to smaller independent brewers, imports, and wine and spirits in recent years, according to the Brewers Association.\n\n\u201cThe beer market has shifted and beer lovers are increasingly demanding more variety, fuller-flavor, and local products from small and independent producers,\u201d said Bart Watson, the Brewers Association\u2019s chief economist.\n\nOverall U.S. beer sales have declined, with shipments down from 213.1 million barrels in 2008 to 204.2 million in 2017, according to the Brewers Association.\n\nPabst depends on MillerCoors because the only other U.S. brewer with capacity to make its products is Anheuser-Busch, which doesn\u2019t do contract brewing, Paris said.\n\n\u201cIt really is an existential issue for Pabst because it has no real alternatives,\u201d Paris said at the March hearing.\n\nParis said the report from the consultant MillerCoors hired in 2013 proves the company never intended to act in good faith. Pabst\u2019s attorneys say the report had sections focused on how to \u201celiminate Pabst altogether\u201d and noted that MillerCoors would need to close two breweries \u201cto be sure they don\u2019t have excess capacity for contract manufacturing.\u201d\n\nMillerCoors\u2019 attorney, Eric Van Vugt, said in court that the company didn\u2019t rely on the consultant\u2019s report when it decided to close Eden or when it has contemplated closing the Irwindale brewery.\n\n\u201cIf we keep Irwindale open, yes, we can supply their beer,\u201d Van Vugt said. \u201cNo one disputes that.

Nurul Huda said officials decided to shift the date to Dec. 30 in response to the proposals by the opposition parties. The new deadline for filing nominations is Nov. 28.\n\nThe ruling Awami League party, its allies and some opposition parties welcomed the decision, but a new major opposition alliance was unhappy because it wants the elections deferred by a month. The alliance, called the National Oikya Front, consists of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and other parties.\n\nThe National Oikya Front, led by prominent lawyer Kamal Hossain, could pose a major challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\u2019s desire to win a third consecutive term.

The opposition has demanded an independent caretaker administration, saying the election could be rigged under Hasina, a charge she has denied.\n\nZia, 73, has been in jail since February, when she was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment for alleged corruption in the establishment of an orphanage fund during her first term as prime minister in 1991-1996. Following an appeal, the High Court extended her sentence to 10 years.\n\nIn a second case, a trial court last month sentenced Zia to seven years in jail on corruption charges linked to a charity fund named after her late husband.\n\nZia\u2019s party says both cases are politically motivated.\n\nZia faces more than 30 other cases pending in courts across the country.\n\nHer elder son, Tarique Rahman, the heir-apparent in a political culture of dynastic politics, has been in exile in London for years to avoid arrest. A court last month sentenced him in absentia to life in prison in a 2004 grenade attack case.\n\nThe Election Commission last month canceled the political registration of Jamaat-e-Islami, the main partner of Zia\u2019s party, which prevents it from participating in the election. Its leaders could contest with a different symbol under the new opposition alliance.\n\nThe court said Jamaat-e-Islami\u2019s registration violated election laws and the spirit of the constitution because the party had opposed the country\u2019s war of independence with Pakistan in 1971. The party is a fierce opponent of Hasina and is eager to regain its strength after the executions of its top leaders on charges of war crimes during the conflict.\n\nThe Dec. 30 polls would be Bangladesh\u2019s 11th general election since it gained independence in the war.\n\nBangladesh has been a parliamentary democracy since 1991 after an autocratic government led by former military chief H.M.

Over half of the global population growth between now and 2050 will take place in Africa, according to U.N. figures.\n\nAccording to the new report, contraceptive use is growing fastest in Africa, even though the region\u2019s fertility rates remain high.\n\nThe most recent U.N. global population report estimates Africa\u2019s fertility rate to be 5.1 births per woman.\n\nBecause the region\u2019s growing population is not backed by substantial rises in family incomes and the development of public infrastructure, there are concerns that a population boom may deepen poverty levels for many Africans.\n\nOver the years, family planning has often been difficult to sell in heavily paternalistic sub-Saharan Africa, with the matter becoming controversial as some African leaders challenge the view that a growing population is bad for the world\u2019s poorest continent.\n\nUgandan President Yoweri Museveni insists Africa needs more people, and has lambasted what he calls \u201cthe shrill cries of NGOs about population control.\u201d\n\nIn February President John Magufuli of Tanzania encouraged polygamy, citing the 10 million more women than men in his country in advising men to marry \u201ctwo or more wives\u201d to reduce the number of single women.\n\n___\n\nMuhumuza reported from Kampala, Uganda.", "OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) \u2014 An early season winter storm has dumped up to 7 inches of snow in the Texas Panhandle and lesser amounts in the western half of Oklahoma as it moves toward Arkansas.\n\nMeteorologist John Cockrell with the National Weather Service in Amarillo said Monday that the heaviest snowfall was reported around Amarillo.\n\nNo injuries or significant damage are reported as the system moved across the region.

November 6, 2018\n\nPost midterm, country must strive for unity\n\nThe political tension in Michigan and around the country reached a boiling point with Tuesday\u2019s elections. Neighbors, colleagues, friends and even family have been torn apart over politics. That kind of contempt for our fellow Americans is not healthy. Now that this contentious midterm is over, we urge everyone to embrace civility.\n\nThat seems next to impossible when the rhetoric coming from political leaders on both sides of the aisle is so contentious.\n\nPresident Donald Trump stirs the pot continually, calling out those he dislikes and making fun of his detractors. Yet even Trump, in a recent interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group, admitted he regretted not having had a softer tone in his first two years in office.\n\nDemocrats are hardly blameless either. During the campaign, leaders rallied their followers with confrontational language.\n\nThe constant drumbeat of negativity is having real effects on citizens.\n\nA 2016 Pew Research Center poll found that partisans\u2019 opinions of those in the other party were lower than they\u2019d been in a quarter of a century. We imagine these numbers are even worse now.\n\nSeventy percent of Democrats believed that Republicans are more closed-minded than other Americans. Republicans (52 percent) thought Democrats are closed-minded and nearly half thought Democrats are lazy and dishonest.\n\nEven worse, the poll found that many citizens actually fear members of the opposing party. \u201cMore than half of Democrats (55 percent) say the Republican Party makes them \u2018afraid,\u2019 while 49 percent of Republicans say the same about the Democratic Party,\u201d according to Pew.\n\nWhere to go from here?

Major Taylor was only 39, and he leaves behind a wife and seven young children.\n\nBut he also left a message that resonates.\n\nTaylor\u2019s last Facebook post (dated Oct. 28) read, \u201cAs the USA gets ready to vote in our own election, I hope everyone back home exercises their precious right to vote.

November 7, 2018\n\nDon\u2019t play games with pot voters\n\nAs expected, Michigan voters overwhelming approved legalizing marijuana for recreational use on Tuesday. We still think it was a bad idea, but that does not matter anymore because the voters have spoken.\n\nStatewide, Proposal 1 was approved 55 percent to 45 percent. The ratio was similar in St. Clair County. In Port Huron, 62 percent of voters said yes. In Sanilac County, though, 56 percent of voters said no to legalizing marijuana.\n\nState officials say the possession and use of marijuana by adults could be legal by early December. Expect months, if not years, of bureaucratic and political foot-dragging in Lansing before it is possible to actually buy any at retail, though.\n\nLame-duck Gov. Rick Snyder, in a statement Wednesday, said it shouldn\u2019t be that way.\n\n\u201cNow that the decisions have been made, it\u2019s time to move forward,\u201d he said. \u201cState officials should begin their work in earnest to implement the new state laws and ensure the proper regulatory frameworks are in place.\u201d\n\nIt has been a decade since Michigan voters approved marijuana for medical use. Yet there are almost no dispensaries where patients can acquire the drug. And that is despite the state finally erecting a framework \u2014 more than a year ago \u2014 to license and regulate medical marijuana dispensaries and other facilities.\n\nState regulators say that their experience with that boondoggle means that licensing recreational marijuana businesses will go more smoothly. Perhaps appropriately, this is an editorial about marijuana.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that the initiative process in Michigan allows the Legislature to get involved. Lawmakers could have passed their own bills to legalize pot but didn\u2019t have the political courage. Those who fear the worst expect the Legislature to make it easier for local governments to negate the will of voters. Instead of requiring cities and townships to say yes or no to marijuana, as they do now with medical facilities, Lansing could make hiding from a decision the same as saying no.\n\nLocal officials need to check Tuesday\u2019s vote totals. Their constituents, all adults, chose to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. Ignoring voters, a lot of candidates learned Tuesday, is not the path to re-election.\n\nOfficials who fear the negative effects of legalizing marijuana should want quick and effective implementation of state controls and regulations. Red tape, foot-dragging and unreasonably high excise taxes can only reinforce and encourage lawlessness and promote the growth and survival of the marijuana black market.\n\nThe recreational use of marijuana is the law in Michigan now.

New federal guidelines released on Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, advise that children as young as age 3 should move more, sit less and get more active, and that any amount and any type of exercise helps health. (Aaron Marineau/The Hutchinson News via AP)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Move more, sit less and get kids active as young as age 3, say new federal guidelines that stress that any amount and any type of exercise helps health.\n\nThe advice is the first update since the government\u2019s physical activity guidelines came out a decade ago. Since then, the list of benefits of exercise has grown, and there\u2019s more evidence to back things that were of unknown value before, such as short, high-intense workouts and taking the stairs instead of an elevator.\n\n\u201cDoing something is better than doing nothing, and doing more is better than doing something,\u201d said Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, a preventive medicine expert at Northwestern University in Chicago.\n\nOnly 20 percent of Americans get enough exercise now, and the childhood obesity problem has prompted the push to aim younger to prevent poor health later in life.\n\nHighlights of the advice released Monday at an American Heart Association conference in Chicago and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association:\n\nCHILDREN AND TEENS\n\nThe biggest change: Start young. Guidelines used to begin at age 6, but the new ones say preschoolers ages 3 through 5 should be encouraged to take part in active play throughout the day. They don\u2019t call for a certain amount but say a reasonable target may be three hours of various intensities. That\u2019s consistent with guidelines in many other countries and is the average amount of activity observed in kids this age.\n\nNew federal guidelines on exercise advise starting sooner to get children active. Physical activity guidelines used to start at age 6, but the advice released Monday recommends involving kids as young as 3 in active play. (Nov. 12)\n\nFrom ages 6 through 17, at least an hour of moderate-to-vigorous activity throughout the day is recommended. Most of it should be aerobic, the kind that gets the heart rate up such as brisk walking, biking or running. At least three times a week, exercise should be vigorous and include muscle- and bone-strengthening activities like climbing on playground equipment or playing sports.\n\nADULTS\n\nDuration stays the same \u2014 at least 2\u00bd to 5 hours of moderate-intensity or 1 \u00bc to 2 \u00bd hours of vigorous activity a week, plus at least two days that include muscle-strengthening exercise like pushups or lifting weights.\n\nOne key change: It used to be thought that aerobic activity had to be done for at least 10 minutes. Now even short times are known to help. Even a single episode of activity gives short-term benefits such as lowering blood pressure, reducing anxiety and improving sleep.\n\nSitting a lot is especially harmful.\n\nThe advice is similar for older adults, but activities should include things that promote balance to help avoid falls.\n\nBROUGHT TO YOU BY THE LETTER E\n\nTargeting young children is the goal of a project that Dr. Valentin Fuster, a cardiologist at New York\u2019s Mount Sinai Hospital, has worked on for years with the Heart Association and Sesame Workshop, producers of television\u2019s \u201cSesame Street.\u201d\n\nAt the heart conference, he gave results of an intensive four-month program to improve knowledge and attitudes about exercise and health among 562 kids ages 3 to 5 in Head Start preschools in Harlem.\n\n\u201cIt was really successful,\u201d Fuster said. \u201cOnce they understand how the body works, they begin to understand physical activity\u201d and its importance.\n\nWhen brains are young, \u201cit\u2019s the best opportunity\u201d to set health habits that last, he said.\n\n___\n\nMarilynn Marchione can be followed at @MMarchioneAP\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Wickremesinghe said in an interview with The Associated Press that the deal helped the country avoid defaulting on debts accumulated during Rajapaksa\u2019s presidency.\n\nSirisena has accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge that Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied and that so far has not led to any arrests.\n\n___\n\nA POWER PLAY\n\nOn Oct. 26, the alliance between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe formally fell apart, with Sirisena naming Rajapaksa the new prime minister and suspending Parliament.\n\nAfter a week of upheaval, Sirisena announced he was dissolving Parliament and calling snap elections due on Jan. 5. He later explained in a nationally televised address that he dissolved Parliament out of fear that lawmakers would come to blows over his Oct. 26 decision.\n\n___\n\nREFUSING TO STAND DOWN\n\nWickremesinghe has been holed up in the prime minister\u2019s official residence in Colombo \u2014 surrounded by a skeleton security crew, supporters and Buddhist monks \u2014 since he was ousted and maintains he is the country\u2019s rightful leader. He has repeatedly called for Parliament to be reconvened so that he could prove his majority support among the country\u2019s 225 lawmakers.\n\nHe alleges that the snap election was called only when it became clear that Rajapaksa had failed to lure enough lawmakers to his side with offers of cash and jobs and would lose any confidence vote in Parliament.\n\n___\n\nA CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION\n\nThere is debate over whether Sirisena\u2019s Oct. 26 move was legal.\n\nHe has cited a general clause in Sri Lanka\u2019s Constitution stating that the president has the power to summon or suspend Parliament.\n\nSupreme Court petitioners challenging Sirisena\u2019s actions argue that a specific clause in the 19th amendment, added in 2015, stipulates that Parliament can\u2019t be dissolved until 4 1/2 years after its election, unless 2/3 of Parliament requests it happen sooner. The current Parliament was elected in August 2015.\n\n___\n\nWHO\u2019S RUNNING SRI LANKA\n\nSirisena and Rajapaksa formed a Cabinet of party loyalists and government defectors within days of the Oct. 26 shakeup. They quickly cut fuel prices, a popular measure among those who blamed the Wickremesinghe-led government for Sri Lanka\u2019s sluggish economy.\n\n___\n\nTHE PUBLIC REACTS\n\nMembers of Wickremesinghe\u2019s political coalition, supporters and chanting Buddhist monks quickly set up camp in a hall at the prime minister\u2019s official residence after Sirisena withdrew most of Wickremesinghe\u2019s security personnel.\n\nFour days into the crisis, at least 10,000 people marched through central Colombo demanding that Sirisena summon Parliament.\n\nSirisena and Rajapaksa responded by organizing a massive rally on Nov. 5, with politicians from their party bringing busloads of constituents into Colombo. Police estimated at least 120,000 attended.\n\n___\n\nINTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION\n\nThe U.S. has said that Sirisena\u2019s decision to dissolve Parliament \u201cposes a vital threat to Sri Lanka\u2019s democratic institutions.\u201d Colombo-based diplomats from Australia, the U.K. and the European Union also issued statements calling for the country\u2019s constitution and democracy to be respected.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has offered to moderate discussions between Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe. On Sunday, he urged the government to respect \u201cdemocratic processes and institutions.\u201d\n\nChina and India have been careful not to take an overt position in Sri Lanka, which has been a battleground in their struggle for geopolitical supremacy in South Asia.\n\n___\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n\nPetitioners asked the Supreme Court on Monday to declare Sirisena\u2019s decrees null and void. That decision could come as early as Tuesday.\n\nBoth Rajapaksa and Sirisena have said they will face the Jan. 5 election together.\n\nSirisena suggested on Sunday that he could have Wickremesinghe forcibly removed from the prime minister\u2019s residence.", "STOWE, Pa.
