["Despite a fight to keep open a polling place in Dodge City, Kansas, that had been more accessible for its mostly Latino residents, a federal judge is allowing the Ford County clerk to close it and instead open a polling site outside the city limits for Nov. 6 voting.\n\nThe ACLU of Kansas filed a lawsuit seeking a temporary restraining order against Ford County Clerk Debbie Cox last week after she closed the sole polling location in a city with a near 60 percent Latino population and opened a site out of town.\n\nThe ACLU argued that the new polling site, at an exposition center, is not accessible by public transportation and is on a route with few sidewalks.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the total travel time from a centrally located part of Dodge City to the Expo Center would take approximately ninety minutes each way for a voter using public transportation,\u201d the suit charged.\n\nU.S. District Judge Daniel Crabtree denied the request Thursday to force Cox to reopen the Civic Center polling place, citing concerns about the suit\u2019s timing and potential voter confusion, The Associated Press reported.\n\nWe're not finished in #DodgeCity. \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffd\n\n\n\n\"...the court notes, for now, its concerns about Ms. Cox\u2019s 'LOL' comment and questions whether it manifests a disregard for the 'fundamental significance' that our Constitution places on the right to vote.\"https://t.co/6Ui2XiiXuR \u2014 ACLU of Kansas (@aclukansas) November 2, 2018\n\n\u201cFor the court to insert itself into this process on the eve of the election \u2014 by ordering the reopening of the Civic Center either as the only polling location or a second polling location \u2014 likely would create more voter confusion than it might cure,\u201d Crabtree wrote in the ruling.\n\nCox decided to close Dodge City\u2019s only polling site at its Civic Center after learning about plans for a construction project there, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe county clerk reportedly acknowledged in court that the construction did not end up happening before the election, as she anticipated, according to The Wichita Eagle.\n\nCox also reportedly testified that she has since contacted the city government to arrange transportation from the Civic Center to the Western State Bank Expo Center, while acknowledging she has never taken public transportation in Dodge City herself, the Eagle reported.\n\nHuffPost has reached out to Cox for comment but has not received a response.\n\nCox told the Eagle last week that her decision for the move was based on safety and that it was not done with \u201cany racial intention at all.\u201d\n\nLauren Bonds, the legal director of the ACLU of Kansas, said the organization sought to have the polling site at the Civic Center reopen in part because newly registered voters had received incorrect information from county election officials on where to cast a ballot for midterm elections.\n\nOfficial registration certificates sent to new voters reportedly listed only the Civic Center as the official polling site, not the Expo Center.\n\n(2/2) Party affiliation breakdown - Ballots mailed: Dem - 71,647; Lib - 1,133; Rep - 82,805; Unaff. - 38,041.

(AP) \u2014 A shooter killed two people and wounded five others at a yoga studio in Florida\u2019s capital before killing himself Friday, officials said.\n\nTallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo told reporters Friday night that the man shot six people and pistol-whipped another after walking into the studio, which is part of a small Tallahassee shopping center.\n\nThe suspect then fatally shot himself, DeLeo said. Authorities have not identified the shooter or the victims. The conditions of the other victims are unclear.\n\nDeLeo said police are asking for anyone who saw something unusual around the time of the shooting to contact police. He said the shooter acted alone and authorities are investigating possible motives. He declined to say what kind of gun the shooter had.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all very saddened and shocked by the events that occurred, but it\u2019s important that people understand that there is no immediate threat outside of what has already occurred this evening,\u201d DeLeo said.\n\nMelissa Hutchinson said she helped treat a \u201cprofusely\u201d bleeding man who rushed into a bar after the incident. She said three people from the studio ran in, and they were told there was an active shooter.\n\n\u201cIt was a shocking moment something happened like this,\u201d Hutchinson said.\n\nThe people who came in were injured, including the bleeding man who was pistol-whipped while trying to stop the shooter. They told her the shooter kept coming in and out of the studio. When he loaded his gun, people started pounding the windows of the studio to warn people.\n\nCity Commissioner Scott Maddox was on the scene. He said on Facebook, \u201cIn my public service career I have had to be on some bad scenes. This is the worst. Please pray.\u201d\n\nElle Welling said she was leaving a liquor store across the street from the shopping center and saw at least three people loaded into ambulances.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think about this in Tallahassee and now you have to,\u201d said Welling, 26, who lives in the neighborhood.\n\nThe plaza is home to popular restaurants, a jewelry store, a framing shop, a hair salon and other businesses.\n\nErskin Wesson, 64, said he was eating dinner with his family at a restaurant located below the yoga studio when they heard the gunshots above them.\n\n\u201cWe just heard \u2018pow, pow, pow, pow,\u2019\u201d Wesson said. \u201cIt sounded like a limb falling on a tin roof and rolling.\u201d\n\nThe restaurant\u2019s owner came by a short time later, asking if anyone was a doctor, Wesson said. His step-daughter is an emergency room nurse and helped paramedics for about an hour, he said.\n\nTallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who is the Democratic nominee for governor, tweeted that he\u2019s breaking off the campaign trail to return to Tallahassee. He earlier appeared at a campaign event with former President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply appreciative of law enforcement\u2019s quick response to the shooting at the yoga facility in Tallahassee today. No act of gun violence is acceptable. I\u2019m in close communication with law enforcement officials and will be returning to Tallahassee tonight,\u201d Gillum tweeted.\n\nRepublican Gov. Rick Scott, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, called DeLeo and the head of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to get details of the shooting.\n\n\u201cI will remain in constant communication with law enforcement,\u201d Scott tweeted. \u201cWe have offered state assistance.\u201d", "ASSOCIATED PRESS Former President Barack Obama rallies with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum (left) and Democratic Senate candidate Bill Nelson in Florida four days before the election.\n\nMIAMI \u2015 Barack Obama returned Friday to a state he carried twice with a fiery call to reject his successor\u2019s divisive and falsehood-filled politics by voting for Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like what\u2019s going on right now, don\u2019t just complain. Don\u2019t get anxious,\u201d he told more than 4,000 supporters jammed into the Ice Palace movie studios in a largely African-American section of Miami. \u201cDon\u2019t boo. Don\u2019t hashtag. Vote!\u201d\n\nGillum is the mayor of Florida\u2019s capital city, Tallahassee, and hopes to become Florida\u2019s first black governor. Nelson is seeking his fourth term in the Senate.\n\nObama had remained relatively quiet for the first year and a half of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, but in recent months, with the midterm elections approaching, he has been hammering at Trump\u2019s policies and character.\n\nSounding relaxed in rolled-up shirtsleeves, Obama told his audience that Tuesday\u2019s election was critical for issues ranging from voting rights to the minimum wage to health care. He reminded them that major societal changes, from ending slavery to establishing LGBTQ rights, have often been followed by a backlash from \u201cthe status quo\u201d \u2015 one step back for every two forward. \u201cMaking this country better has never been easy,\u201d he said.\n\nDemonstrators interrupted his remarks several times \u2015 and each time Obama tried to defuse the situation with humor. \u201cWhy is it that the folks that won the last election are so mad all the time?\u201d he said after the final protester was removed by security staff.\n\nObama won Florida relatively easily in his 2008 presidential run but more narrowly in his re-election bid four years later. He said defending his signature Affordable Care Act was one of the biggest issues on the ballot now and that Republicans \u2015 including current Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who\u2019s running for the Senate, and former Jacksonville area Rep. Ron DeSantis, who\u2019s trying to replace Scott as governor \u2015 have been trying to undermine and repeal the law for all eight years since it was passed.\n\nOnly now, with the midterms around the corner, he said, are Republicans saying they want to preserve one of its most important features: the protection of coverage for those with pre-existing medical conditions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s some kind of gall. That\u2019s some kind of chutzpah. Let\u2019s call it what it is. It\u2019s a lie,\u201d the former president said, adding that protecting the law was reason enough to return Nelson to the Senate. \u201cFlorida, we can\u2019t let Rick Scott become the deciding vote.\u201d\n\nBeyond the issues, though, Obama spoke at length about the angry rhetoric coming from Trump and his supporters as well as the most recent attempts to frighten voters with barely veiled appeals to racial animus.\n\n\u201cMaybe most of all, the character of our country is on the line. In the closing weeks of this election, we have seen repeated attempts designed to make us angry and mean-spirited,\u201d Obama said.\n\nHe said fear-mongering tactics were not new \u2015 they were used in the midterms of 2010 and 2014 during his presidency. \u201cNow, in 2018, they\u2019re telling you that the existential threat to America is a bunch of poor refugees a thousand miles away. They\u2019re even taking our brave troops away from their families for a political stunt,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the practical effects of policies. When words stop meaning anything, when truth doesn\u2019t matter, when people can just lie with abandon, democracy can\u2019t work,\u201d Obama added, criticizing Trump\u2019s frequent falsehoods and apparent disregard for facts.\n\nAnd as he has been doing in recent public remarks \u2015 and with the GOP touting strong jobs numbers released Friday morning \u2015 Obama pointed out that the strong economy that Trump and the Republicans now brag about is a continuation of the trend that began under his watch following the recession of 2008 and 2009.\n\n\u201cApparently right now the economy is so good. When do you think that started?\u201d he asked to laughter and cheers, adding that more jobs were created in the final 21 months of his administration than have been created in the first 21 months of Trump\u2019s.\n\nRecent public polls show Gillum with a modest lead and Nelson with an even smaller edge. Using their voter turnout models, though, Republicans believe that Scott is likely to eke out a victory and that DeSantis could also win with a big Election Day turnout.", "A second suspicious package has been mailed to billionaire hedge fund manager and Democratic donor Tom Steyer, FBI officials have revealed.\n\nThe package appeared to be similar to a series of mailings of pipe bombs sent earlier to at least 13 Democratic political figures and others who have been attacked by President Donald Trump, including CNN, NBC reported.\n\nThe latest package sent to Steyer was intercepted Thursday at a postal facility in Burlingame, California. Steyer was sent a similar package seven days earlier, which was intercepted at the same facility.\n\n\u201cThe package was very similar in appearance to the others,\u201d Katherine Zackel, a spokeswoman for the FBI\u2019s San Francisco office, told the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nThe package was \u201crendered safe\u201d off site by bomb tech experts and removed to an FBI lab for further examination, Zackel said. She offered no other details on what was inside.\n\nThe suspect in the string of earlier mailings, Cesar Sayoc, has been in jail since Oct. 26. The van he was living in at the time of his arrest was plastered with photos of Trump, images of faces of the president\u2019s critics marked with gunsight crosshairs, and a sign saying \u201cCNN sucks.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Sayoc\u2019s family, Ron Lowy, who also represented Sayoc in earlier criminal cases, said he didn\u2019t believe Sayoc had the mental capacity to carry out a pipe bomb operation alone. Lowy said he may have been prodded by others, or the devices were so crudely made that they wouldn\u2019t function.\n\nOfficials have not yet said whether they believe Sayoc is responsible for the packages mailed to Steyer. Earlier this week, postal workers intercepted another package addressed to CNN at a postal facility in Atlanta.\n\nTrump just last Sunday \u2014 two days after Sayoc\u2019s arrest \u2014 bashed Steyer in a tweet as a \u201ccrazed and stumbling lunatic.\u201d\n\nThe president was responding to Steyer\u2019s appearance on TV to criticize a tweet by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) as a \u201cstraight-up anti-Semitic move.\u201d The tweet attacked three Democratic Jewish donors \u2014 Steyer, Michael Bloomberg and George Soros \u2014 for using their wealth to \u201cbuy\u201d the midterm elections. Soros was also sent a pipe bomb last month.\n\nMcCarthy deleted the tweet shortly after the bomb was sent to Soros and just days before suspected gunman Robert Bowers allegedly killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue in an anti-Semitic attack.", "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 It\u2019s 8:15 a.m., and a group of 40 or so people await him. They\u2019ve been standing around the front of Bethel AME Church in their \u201cAndrew Gillum for governor\u201d tees for about an hour. When they see Gillum striding toward them, they erupt into raucous applause. He immediately scoops up Jett Williams, a precocious 2-year-old sitting in a wagon and sporting a Florida A&M University football jersey, initiating the first of many photo ops that Saturday in early October.\n\nGillum, 39, has barely handed Jett back to the boy\u2019s mother, Kay Harper Williams, before a group of people in \u201cBlack Voters Matter\u201d shirts rush up to him with their arms extended and their camera apps open. He stretches out his arms and flashes a bright smile that quickly becomes a warm chuckle.\n\nSee, it\u2019s homecoming, y\u2019all. And Gillum is a fixture of FAMU\u2019s homecoming parade. They love him here, not in the way that fans love a celebrity or adherents love their leader. It\u2019s simpler than that \u2014 something like a mother doting on a long-lost son. Except that Gillum is at home here. He served on the Tallahassee City Commission from 2003 to 2014 before he was elected mayor, a position he has held since. He\u2019s a Rattler, having graduated from the university in 2003. This is his element.\n\nAround here, Gillum needs no introduction, and he don\u2019t meet no strangers. These are his talents. He is at home everywhere, and everywhere he is loved like someone who finally came home.\n\nWillie J. Allen Jr. for HuffPost Every facet of his platform, Gillum says, is rooted in his life.\n\nA few weeks ago, something miraculous happened in American politics. A black politician called a white politician a racist and got away with it. A black man called a white man a racist in public, on live television, and he did it so deftly, and he so discombobulated the other guy, that people forgot to accuse him of playing the race card.\n\nTo be sure, Gillum technically didn\u2019t call his Republican opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, a racist during their second debate. That was the political genius of the riff. Later, a campaign staffer told me Gillum cribbed the concluding line from a pastor with whom he spoke about two weeks before the debate. It was strategic, and Gillum was prepared to use it. How could he not? This was oppo from God.\n\nLet me back up, though. The context is important. From the surprising moment in August when Gillum grabbed the Democratic nomination, making him the first black major-party gubernatorial candidate in Florida\u2019s history, racism became the fulcrum of the election. This was certainly not Gillum\u2019s desire when he launched his bid for governor; his people are at pains to say his campaign is not explicitly about race. Endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Gillum is running on a straightforward populist platform: Medicare-for-all, hiking the minimum wage, boosting Florida\u2019s corporate tax rate.\n\nBut then DeSantis told Florida voters not to \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by electing Gillum. And then voters began receiving robocalls from a neo-Nazi group in Idaho. In the call, a man pretends to be Gillum and says in a stereotypically exaggerated dialect over drums and jungle noises, \u201cWe Negroes \u2026 done made mud huts while white folk waste a bunch of time making their home out of wood an\u2019 stone.\u201d The speaker also falsely claims that Gillum will pass a law allowing black people to escape arrest \u201cif the Negro know fo\u2019 sho he didn\u2019t do nothin\u2019.\u201d\n\nAnd then a GOP official from the Orlando area posted a meme falsely claiming that Gillum will issue reparations for African enslavement. And then, stumping for DeSantis on Oct. 6, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) accused Gillum of overseeing a rise in crime in Tallahassee, dubbing him \u201cAndrew Kill \u2019Em.\u201d (In September the Leon County sheriff said violent crime has dropped since Gillum has been in office.)\n\nAnd then a second robocall went out from the same group, once again featuring a man pretending to be Gillum and speaking in an exaggerated dialect, this one with Negro spirituals interlaced with monkey screeches in the background as the narrator muses that using chicken feet as medicine is what would keep Gillum\u2019s health plan cheap.\n\nThe election had become a local production of America\u2019s ongoing psychodrama about race. During the candidates\u2019 second debate on Oct. 24, the moderator began winding his way through a question regarding DeSantis\u2019 \u201cmonkey this up\u201d statement and why he made four appearances at events hosted by a white nationalist. But before the moderator could finish, DeSantis lashed out, declaring that he wouldn\u2019t let the media smear him and he wouldn\u2019t take anything from Gillum.\n\nTo this, Gillum dropped his head and chuckled, and then he put home what will go down as an iconic slam dunk. \u201cWell, let me first say, my grandmother used to say, \u2018A hit dog will holler.\u2019 And it hollered through this room. Mr. DeSantis has spoken. First of all, he\u2019s got neo-Nazis helping him out in the state. He has spoken at racist conferences. He\u2019s accepted a contribution and would not return it from someone who referred to the former president of the United States as a Muslim n-i-g-g-e-r,\u201d Gillum said, spelling out the slur once tweeted by Steven Alembik in reference to Barack Obama. \u201cWhen asked to return that money, he said no. He\u2019s using that money to now fund negative ads.\u201d\n\nAnd here came the coup de grace, the line the pastor handed him. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist,\u201d Gillum said, shooting his eyebrows skyward and nodding. \u201cI\u2019m simply saying the racists believe he\u2019s a racist.\u201d\n\nIt was a perfect formulation, suggesting both a fluency and an impatience with how the political and media culture typically handles accusations of racism. Black candidates operate in a bind. They can\u2019t call out racism because the minute they do, they\u2019ll be accused of playing the race card, of responding emotionally to attacks based in the denial of their humanity. Had he gone directly after DeSantis and bluntly called him a racist, Gillum might have expected several weeks\u2019 worth of tortured coverage: Is DeSantis truly a racist? There would be testimonials from his side, black friends of DeSantis\u2019 deposited in front of cameras and microphones, counteraccusations that his opponent was making too much of race, and in turn, Gillum would be pressed to qualify his statement.\n\nBut Gillum avoided the trap. People responded to it as if it were a sports highlight. When I first saw it, I laughed and said \u201cOh, shit!\u201d as if I had just watched Allen Iverson step over Tyronn Lue for the first time. Gillum was smooth up there too, rolling into the line instead of snapping it off in the hammy way that politicians often do.\n\n\u201cWhat happens too often happens to black people in a role such as his is that you find that you have to be twice as prepared, you have to toe the line more than anyone else but that you\u2019re carrying your people on your shoulders,\u201d said Cynthia Moore Chestnut, a former member of the Florida House of Representatives and now the chairwoman of the Alachua County Democratic Party. \u201cSo you can\u2019t afford not to be prepared, not to seize the moment. You have to because you\u2019re representing more than yourself.\n\n\u201cBut you know, we have to walk on water. We have to walk on water.\u201d\n\nWillie J. Allen Jr. for HuffPost \u201cIt was energizing, and I\u2019m honored that somebody wants to take a picture,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cIt\u2019s not work for me.\u201d\n\nBy 8:57 a.m. on the day of FAMU\u2019s homecoming parade, Gillum has greeted at least a hundred people. He hasn\u2019t broken a sweat. Every person gets the best version of Gillum that he has to offer. He stops to greet a woman sitting on the side of the road watching the parade. He holds her hand as she shouts out that she\u2019s praying for him and his wife, R. Jai Gillum.\n\nThe scene charges up Andrew Gillum\u2019s entourage. They start chanting their campaign slogan, \u201cBring it home, Andrew! Bring it home!\u201d He stops again to photograph one of his campaign staffers and another member of the black sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha, the latter woman wearing a \u201cPretty girls for Gillum\u201d shirt. He pushes the importance of voting while conversing with a woman on her Instagram live. He frequently leaves his designated spot behind the car guiding his path through the parade to interact with onlookers \u2014 a maneuver that causes one member of his entourage to gently guide him back to his spot. Defiantly, Gillum jogs to the other side of the road to do it all over again.\n\nWhen he\u2019s not going to the people, they\u2019re running to him. They have their cameras in their hand, ready to take photos and shake hands with the man they believe will be the next governor of Florida. While this may seem exhausting to some, Gillum meets everyone with open arms and says he doesn\u2019t mind the onslaught of attention.\n\n\u201cIt was energizing, and I\u2019m honored that somebody wants to take a picture,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not work for me.\u201d\n\nThis love for people was a gift from his father, Charles Gillum. He worked in construction, and when things were slow, he and a young Andrew would sell fruit on a corner, back when no one cared to take Andrew\u2019s photo. On the street, watching his father look his customers in the eye, Andrew learned an early lesson in what you might call retail politics.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d loop people in personally. \u2018What\u2019s going on? How\u2019s such and such?\u2019 That kind of thing. And then they\u2019d leave buying stuff they didn\u2019t think they needed because my dad had hooked them in,\u201d Andrew Gillum says with a laugh. \u201cBut he loves people, and that love for people passes on. It\u2019s not new to me.\u201d\n\nFrom his mama, Frances Gillum, and her people, he got the habits of selflessness you tend to find in church mothers in un-air-conditioned Southern Baptist chapels after service. She is from Clyattville, a small town right outside Valdosta, Georgia, and tucked deep into the state\u2019s farm belt, where Southern hospitality is law. \u201cI remember my grandmother, if she had nothing in the refrigerator ... [and] people came over, somehow she was making something. And it was always good,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019d make something out of nothing. But that\u2019s what you do for folks when they come by to see you. When they take interest in you, you do what you can to accommodate.\u201d\n\nChestnut remembers Andrew Gillum as a teenager living in Gainesville, Florida. He was best friends with her son, Chris. After school, Gillum and other students would head over to Chestnut\u2019s house to chill. While the others were out front eating pizza, Gillum would be in the kitchen, helping her prepare food or talking.\n\n\u201cHe was always the helper. My son said that they called him \u2018the principal\u2019 because he was the one in class always prepared, ready with the agenda, with whatever needed to happen. He believes in being prepared,\u201d she says. (If there was a hint of an insult in the nickname other kids assigned to him, it hasn\u2019t lived on in the anecdote\u2019s telling.) \u201cIt said a lot to me about the kind of person he was \u2014 and he is.\u201d\n\nHis politics flow out of his personality. Every facet of his platform, Gillum says, is rooted in his life. When he talks about health care, he recalls those all-day waits at the free dental clinic to have his teeth cleaned as a child. He remembers believing that\u2019s the way things worked \u2014 you went, and you waited your turn. He stumps for increasing teacher pay because of educators who saw something in him worth saving.\n\nGillum fights for LGBTQ equality because he has a gay sibling who packed up and left for California, he says, \u201cjust so that he could be himself.\u201d Cliff Thaell, a former Leon County commissioner-at-large, recalls Gillum speaking to a crowd at First Presbyterian Church in Tallahassee after the Pulse shooting in Orlando in 2016.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe was able to take all that pain and express that we were going to stand up to that kind of terrorism, that kind of bullying, to the NRA, but he put it in a personal context,\u201d says Thaell. \u201cHe was able to take that incident and put it in the most personal of terms and share it with a large crowd of people and help us feel his pain \u2014 and his leadership, his vision.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Gillum\u2019s approach to criminal justice reform \u2014 including bail reform, restoration of voting rights and \u201cban the box\u201d measures, which would prohibit asking on job applications whether applicants have a criminal record \u2014 was informed by his siblings\u2019 experience. Three of his brothers have had run-ins with the law. His older brother Patrick Gillum was accused of burglary and assault in 1991. A few months later, he was sentenced to a year in jail for cocaine possession. That year, 17-year-old Chuck Gillum was charged with armed robbery and sentenced as an adult. Patrick Gillum took plea deals because he couldn\u2019t afford to post bail, and both brothers had a hard time finding work after their release. In 1999, Chuck Gillum was sentenced to 15 years in prison for trafficking just under a pound of cocaine. In 2006, Eric Gillum was sentenced to four years for burglary.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not somebody\u2019s talking point,\u201d says Andrew Gillum of his criminal justice platform. \u201cThat\u2019s what I believe. And it\u2019s shaped by the fact that I\u2019ve seen how this thing plays out and how it works.\u201d\n\nWillie J. Allen Jr. for HuffPost Gillum's slogan, \"Bring it home,\" is based in an ideal instilled in him by his maternal grandmother.\n\nElla Baker Jackson, Gillum\u2019s maternal grandmother, was the only child in her family to attend grade school. She, like many black kids who were fortunate enough to attend school in the early days of Jim Crow, was instructed to bring home what she had learned in class so she could educate the rest of the family. She instilled the same notion in Gillum.\n\n\u201cI can still hear my grandmother\u2019s voice,\u201d he says in a campaign ad from September. \u201cShe said, \u2018Go to school, mind your teachers, get your lesson. And one day, bring your education home.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBring it home\u201d is now his campaign slogan. Too little has been said of the role memaws play in shaping the politics of black folk. I\u2019m serious. Grandmothers are a kind of government unto themselves in the black community, at once a legislature, an executive and a judiciary. It\u2019s one-party rule, tough but fair, a whole benevolent system of social control running on anecdote and aphorism (\u201cA hit dog gon\u2019 always holler,\u201d my Muss would always say.)\n\nBlack grandmothers might be affectionate and nurturing, but there\u2019s nothing soft about their job, which is to raise their grandkids to be impenetrable. They ensure that you know how to handle all the racist ills that will inevitably be thrown your way. They\u2019ve been where you\u2019re trying to go \u2015 so they hip you to how folks will try to discredit your intellect and your experiences. They reaffirm your blackness. They guide you through what it means to be black in this country. They teach you what it means to demand respect as a black person and that no bit of disrespect is too small to raise hell over.\n\nThey lay a foundation in their grandkids for a moral self, which is what becomes a political self.\n\nWillie J. Allen Jr. for HuffPost \u201cI don\u2019t think people are looking for perfect. They\u2019re looking for real,\u201d says Gillum.\n\nDuring my day following him around Tallahassee, I realized something about Gillum. He is black black. He is openly and proudly black in a way rarely seen in politics, which tend to prefer a blackness that\u2019s been modulated by white institutions. He grew up poor in South Miami-Dade County. He has multiple family members who have cycled through the criminal justice system. He attended a historically black university. He\u2019s black in the big things and the small ones. At a Congressional Black Caucus Week forum in September, I noticed him pointing at his interlocutor and popping his hand back \u2014 black semaphore for \u201cI heard what you said, and I agree.\u201d He frequently employs African-American vernacular in a natural way. It\u2019s not an empty attempt to connect with black voters who aren\u2019t black like he is. It\u2019s just how he talks. And while blackness is by no means a monolith, Gillum represents a kind of blackness that is commonplace in black life and basically nonexistent in high-level American politics.\n\nHis campaign is an exercise in recasting populism in a black idiom. In political terms, this manifests as a friendly pragmatism. \u201cWe\u2019re running a campaign that is historic in nature but that is practical in its goals,\u201d says one campaign staffer. \u201cThe things that he wants to do are going to help a whole lot of white people. He said that in church \u2026 and everyone laughed. But it\u2019s true, and everyone knows it, and we don\u2019t want to lose sight of that.\u201d\n\nGillum\u2019s political message has remained the same in predominantly white, conservative Baker County as in Democratic stronghold Miami-Dade.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people are looking for perfect. They\u2019re looking for real,\u201d says Gillum. \u201cDonald Trump ain\u2019t perfect. In fact, he\u2019s far from it. He\u2019s, I think, unqualified for the office. But he tapped into something that was real for people, and they rewarded him with their support.\u201d\n\nWillie J. Allen Jr. for HuffPost Andrew Gillum and his wife, R. Jai Gillum, at the FAMU homecoming parade. He\u2019s a Rattler, having graduated from the university in 2003.\n\nIt\u2019s 9:30 a.m. now, and the procession is nearing Bragg Stadium. The crowd up this way is thicker, louder.\n\nWhen Gillum and company round the corner, onlookers let out a roar similar to what you hear when the Rattlers score a touchdown. A little boy who has spotted Gillum shouts, \u201cIt\u2019s Andrew Gillum!\u201d before darting out to meet the mayor. A few steps down the road, a little girl alerts her mother to Gillum\u2019s arrival: \u201cThere he go, Mama! There he go!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what I hear the most in the crowd: variations of \u201cThere he go!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere he go, right here!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere go the man!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere he is!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat just makes us all so proud here,\u201d says Castillo Mitchell, a 22-year-old senior at FAMU and the owner of Flex My Complexion. \u201cAnd just the motivation that it gives us as students \u2026 letting you know that when you come to FAMU, you could go anywhere.\u201d\n\nSays Kay Harper Williams, the mother of 2-year-old Jett, \u201cHope seems clich\u00e9, but I think it definitely puts in perspective what it is that my son can accomplish.\u201d\n\nPolls show that Gillum is locked in a tight race. During the Democratic primary, his campaign drew from his grandmother\u2019s lesson: Even when he didn\u2019t see anything useful lying around, he found a way to make something out of nothing. He beat out more-established and better-funded white candidates to drive the highest turnout in the state\u2019s four most populous counties \u2014 Duval, Orange, Broward and Miami-Dade. These counties also have the highest percentage of black voters. Gillum spent a mere $4 million, compared with the $90 million spent by his opponents. He raised only $6 million. The game plan was pure retail politics.\n\n\u201cThe most dehumanizing part of my day was call time,\u201d he says, shifting his eyes downward for the first time during our conversation, \u201cbecause I knew we weren\u2019t going to raise any money. And I was going to be rejected God knows how many times in that one day. And I just told the team, \u2018Look, this is not getting us anything. Not to mention, it\u2019s beating me down a little bit. I need to get out and talk to people.\u2019\n\n\u201cI kept believing that if we can get to people, if we can get to voters, if we can get into that auditorium or that living room or that space, I could introduce myself, and we will make it work. And so that\u2019s what it became about.\u201d\n\nThere is a lot of, let\u2019s say, audacity in his confidence. He is certain he can walk into a room and tap into the depths of what people need from their elected officials. It is breathtaking.\n\n\u201cWhen it was determined that this was what we were going to do, then we were going to do it. And, like I said, this was nothing but my faith,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThat being said, we\u2019ve got to be ready, and we got to work, and we can\u2019t take anything for granted,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd the beauty of this all is that we decided \u2014 my wife and I both \u2014 when we were going to do this, that we were going to run this race our way and we\u2019d run it by being us. There\u2019s no sense in running for an office as big as this trying to perpetrate somebody that you\u2019re not. My grandmother was like, \u2018Look, son, if you tell the truth, you don\u2019t have to worry about telling enough lies. You just tell the truth.\u2019\u201d\n\nWillie J. Allen Jr. for HuffPost \u201cThis got laid on my heart. I didn\u2019t seek it,\u201d said Gillum of his historic run for governor. \u201cSo all I had to do was be disciplined to it.\"\n\nIn 2015 three men with grandiose plans to redevelop Tallahassee parachuted into the city. Mike Miller, Mike Sweets and Brian Butler began scheduling meetings and attending gatherings with the best-connected people in City Hall, spending months getting tight with city officials.\n\nBut the businessmen were actually undercover FBI agents investigating whether developers were influencing city projects. One lobbyist of particular interest was Adam Corey, a former close friend of Gillum\u2019s. (Gillum has since cut ties with Corey.) In 2016, Corey introduced Miller to Gillum. One meeting of the three men, which took place at a restaurant Corey had developed with taxpayer funds, made headlines because it was scheduled while Corey and Gillum were on vacation with other city lobbyists in Costa Rica. Gillum has said that he didn\u2019t talk about business while he was there and that he paid for his portion of the trip. Corey\u2019s attorney has said otherwise.\n\nA separate investigation by the Florida Commission on Ethics centers on a 2016 trip Andrew Gillum took to New York with his brother Marcus Gillum, Corey and Miller. Emails show that Corey informed Andrew Gillum that Miller had arranged lodging, a trip to a Mets game and a boat ride to the Statue of Liberty. Gillum didn\u2019t attend the Mets game and instead went to a performance of \u201cHamilton.\u201d He says he paid for his trip, but recent texts released from Corey\u2019s attorney indicate that Miller might have covered the tickets. (Although in the grand scheme of politics, \u201cHamilton\u201d tickets are low ball.)\n\nThe FBI probe has resulted in a number of subpoenas name-dropping numerous city officials and insiders. Gillum is not among them.\n\nDespite the lack of charges and despite Gillum\u2019s protestations that FBI agents have assured him he is not the subject of their investigation, the case has lingered. One reason is that corruption has racial valences dating at least as far back as Reconstruction, when the figure of the crooked black politician became a powerful stereotype.\n\nDeSantis and his supporters stop just short of making subtext the text. An October TV ad from the Republican Party of Florida pieces together misleading sound bites from news reporters to back the narrator\u2019s false claim that Gillum is involved in an active criminal investigation and is \u201crunning from the FBI.\u201d Just the other day, President Donald Trump, an avid DeSantis supporter, accused Gillum of being a \u201cthief.\u201d\n\nBetween the corruption talk \u2014 from politicians who are not exactly goo-goos \u2014 and the more straightforward racist political attacks, it\u2019s not hard to see what Gillum\u2019s opponents are driving at. \u201cWe know that the threatening black man \u2026 [has] persisted in our culture for hundreds of years, and they\u2019re employing that,\u201d one campaign staffer tells HuffPost. \u201cThere\u2019s a genetic memory in the population that\u2019s susceptible to these sort of images, these sorts of tones.\u201d\n\nChestnut points to Gillum\u2019s direct interactions with DeSantis during the state\u2019s two gubernatorial debates, during which DeSantis continually referred to Gillum \u2014 a sitting mayor of the capital \u2014 as \u201cAndrew.\u201d Gillum, however, referred to DeSantis as \u201ccongressman\u201d or \u201cMr. DeSantis.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe subliminal message to people watching that debate was \u2018I\u2019m going to put you in your place, boy,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201c\u2019I\u2019m going to put you in your place, and I\u2019m not going to give you your due respect. You can call me mister, \u2019cause that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do \u2014 and I\u2019m going to call you Andrew.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt was just so disrespectful, but to see it happen twice, in each debate? DeSantis did the same thing. It was very disrespectful. That was just very disconcerting \u2026 to see someone as young as DeSantis to carry that subliminal message of \u2018I\u2019m going to put you in your place.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nNone of it shook Gillum, though. In the midst of the attacks, he fell back on his faith. He maintains that God didn\u2019t bring him this far to walk off and leave him. \u201cAt no point did I ever think there wasn\u2019t a way to win,\u201d he says. \u201cAt no point. If I had, I would not have finished. There was no point in the race that I did not think we could win.\n\n\u201cThis got laid on my heart. I didn\u2019t seek it,\u201d he continues. \u201cSo all I had to do was be disciplined to it. Even now, we\u2019re running around the state like we\u2019re 10 points behind, because that\u2019s what you have to do. That hustle is required. But I have to tell you, I think the story is already written on this. I think the outcome is already determined. I\u2019m walking in it.\u201d\n\nWillie J. Allen Jr. for HuffPost The Gillums stand with other FAMU alumni during the homecoming football game coin toss.\n\nBy 10:30 a.m., Gillum is nearing the end of the parade. A smudge of brown foundation sits on his shoulder, a residue of all the hugs he has given in the past two hours. He\u2019s still charged up. He\u2019s still greeting people who flock toward him. His arms are still open, and his smile remains as wide as it was at 8:15.\n\nAs he passes, a woman in the crowd shouts, \u201cHe\u2019s making history!\u201d\n\nMitchell, Harper Williams, Lamb, Chestnut and Thaell all believe that Gillum understands the magnitude of this election. When he won the nomination, he became the first black person to win a major party nomination in the state. Not to mention that seeing another black man doing something like this is affirming in a society that doesn\u2019t allow most black people the space to be anything greater than the racist popular imagination.\n\nLater I ask Gillum about the historic nature of this election. I tell him what black folks around the state have said to me about what his campaign means to them, about what it means to their children and grandchildren. His eyes widen, and a soft \u201cwow\u201d escapes his lips, and he seems to retreat inward. The natural extrovert who always has something to contribute looks stumped by what he should say next.\n\n\u201cI try to keep it in its proper place. Not to let, you know, history overtake the present,\u201d he says, perking back up a bit. \u201cBut not for a moment do I not have, in the backdrop, what this means \u2014 not just for that woman\u2019s children but for my own children and for the kids I mentored over the years \u2014 to be able to see someone that is accessible and that reflects their lives in the way that I think I do. Because there\u2019s nothing that disrupts somebody\u2019s negative opinion of themselves or what people limit them to better than seeing it done.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe needs no introduction!\u201d shouts an announcer at the parade. \u201cThe FAMU graduate, the mayor of the city of Tallahassee ... Andrew Gillum! Let\u2019s hear it for Gov. Andrew Gillum!\u201d\n\nGillum throws his hand up to wave at the crowd surrounding him. Cheers and applause pierce the air, drowning out the ambient noise of the marching bands, and wrap around him like a mother\u2019s warm embrace.\n\n\u201cBring it home, Andrew!\u201d chants the crowd. \u201cBring it home.\u201d", "IDAHO FALLS, Idaho (AP) \u2014 A pack llama that escaped from a guided hike in southern Yellowstone National Park in August was rescued by a Montana outfitter last weekend, just days before most of the park\u2019s entrances were to close for winter preparations.\n\n\u201cI just had to help him,\u201d Susi Huelsmeyer-Sinay with Yellowstone Llamas in Bozeman, Montana, said Friday. \u201cHe was abandoned.\u201d\n\nWilderness Ridge Trail Llamas owner Kirstin Baty of Idaho Falls, Idaho, tells the Jackson Hole News & Guide that Ike ran off after guides loosened his halter because it irritated the spot of a previously abscessed tooth.\n\n\u201cIke slipped out of the halter completely,\u201d Baty said, \u201cbecause he\u2019s sneaky, and he knows he can.\u201d\n\nIt was the second time he\u2019d escaped in the park, but the first foray was less than a couple of weeks in duration, Baty said.\n\nAfter his August escape, the 12- to 15-year-old, 350-pound llama evaded capture attempts for about a month, including special treats and efforts to lure him in with other llamas.\n\n\u201cA lot of groups were looking for him,\u201d said Beau Baty, who owns Wilderness Ridge with his wife. \u201cRangers were looking for him on their days off. It just pushed him deeper into the backcountry.\u201d\n\nThey decided to wait until the weather drove Ike out of the backcountry.\n\nIn the meantime, park visitors reported seeing some strange wildlife. It was one of those reports that fellow Yellowstone concessionaire Hueslmeyer-Sinay heard about on Oct. 24.\n\n\u201cI contacted the park service and with the blessing of the park service I came to Yellowstone last Sunday to check out Ike and see if I could entice him to come home with me or to leave the park,\u201d Hueslmeyer-Sinay told the Post Register of Idaho Falls.\n\nShe brought three llamas and headed to the last known sighting of Ike, near Lewis Lake, southwest of Yellowstone Lake.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, there he was coming up and greeting the three llamas, who in turn greeted him,\u201d she said. \u201cThese guys are herd animals. They need their own kind.\u201d\n\nShe said she turned around with her llamas and Ike followed, eventually getting into a trailer with them for the trip back to Bozeman.\n\nBeau Baty said Ike\u2019s rescuer is going to keep him.", "It\u2019s a surreal experience watching Netflix\u2019s logo flash on-screen before an Orson Welles film. It\u2019s even more surreal watching a brand new Welles film in 2018.\n\nForty-eight years after the director began production on \u201cThe Other Side of the Wind\u201d \u2015 following decades of reshoots, financial hurdles, legal battles with the Shah of Iran, lockdowns in a Parisian vault and the death of the filmmaker himself \u2015 the long-lost movie is finally complete. And anyone with a Netflix account can watch it.\n\nThe resurrection saga of \u201cThe Other Side of the Wind\u201d is both an Old Hollywood story and a New Entertainment tale. Welles is a relic of the way things used to work, when ornery directors would fight studios to scrap together three-quarters of an hour\u2019s worth of mysterious footage only to watch it go down in history as the most famous film never made. Netflix is an emblem of the industry today, a tech company teeming with resources other studios lack, eager to reinvent the distribution model and nail a streaming hit however it can get it.\n\nThe former might never have guessed that the latter would sweep in and save his little movie that never could. But here we are.\n\nThe story of \u201cWind\u201d officially begins in 1969. At the time, Welles was in Guaymas, Mexico, acting in Mike Nichols\u2019 \u201cCatch-22,\u201d a black comedy based on the famous Joseph Heller book. The project was one of the many acting roles Welles took during a decade spent living in Europe \u2014 a self-imposed period of exile that followed an infamous tug of war between the director and Universal over creative control of his 1958 noir \u201cTouch of Evil.\u201d He\u2019d struggled to get projects financed ever since. One day, Peter Bogdanovich, then working as a critic, arrived in Mexico to interview Welles for the American Film Institute. In conversation, Bogdanovich casually mentioned that John Ford, one of their mutual favorite directors, was struggling to get work.\n\nIt upset Welles so much he felt compelled to make a movie about it.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep last night thinking about what you told me about Ford,\u2019\u201d Welles told Bogdanovich. The \u201cLast Picture Show\u201d director mimed as much to me in an interview last month, demonstrating a growly impression of Welles. \u201cI\u2019ve got this movie about an aging macho film director and a young filmmaker. I\u2019ve been thinking about it for a long time. I\u2019m gonna do it next.\u201d\n\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Castellv\u00ed / Netflix An unknown crewmember, Edmund O\u2019Brien, Frank Marshall, Mercedes McCambridge, Oja Kodar and Orson Welles on the set of \"The Other Side of the Wind.\"\n\nA year later, Welles started filming what he hoped would be his grand return to Hollywood. \u201cI think I have to make a very successful box office picture,\u201d Welles confessed in an old interview from the time period, excerpted in \u201cThey\u2019ll Love Me When I\u2019m dead,\u201d Morgan Neville\u2019s new documentary about Welles. \u201cI think I\u2019m getting too old to not have made one.\u201d\n\nStyled as an unorthodox mockumentary, \u201cWind\u201d follows Jake Hannaford, an acclaimed director inspired by Ernest Hemingway. Played by John Huston, Hannaford is scrambling to finance his next picture. Meanwhile, a younger director, played by Bogdanovich, is inching onto his scene. The movie hops between Jake\u2019s 70th birthday party \u2014 shown in a collage of footage shot by a crew of fake news reporters \u2014 and Jake\u2019s movie-within-the-movie, Welles\u2019 satire of \u201970s art house cinema.\n\nJake\u2019s movie is a knock at Michelangelo Antonioni, whose films Welles once slighted as \u201cperfect backgrounds for fashion models.\u201d It imitates the romance plot of the Italian filmmaker\u2019s \u201cZabriskie Point\u201d \u2014 Welles even shot the party scenes at a house next door to the one blown up at the end of Antonioni\u2019s movie. The resulting story is a largely plotless series of languid and psychedelic sequences where a young man (Bob Random) and a female hippie (Oja Kodar, Welles\u2019 romantic partner and collaborator who co-wrote the story) wordlessly gaze at each other across desert landscapes and vacant passageways. With a trippy orgy bathroom sequence and a five-minute sex scene in a car passenger seat, the erotic sequence is unlike anything Welles had ever made.\n\n\u201cWind\u201d at large is an autobiographical reflection of Welles\u2019 decadeslong frustration with the Hollywood studio system. In an old interview dug up for Neville\u2019s documentary, Welles references the time RKO Pictures drastically re-edited his 1942 movie \u201cThe Magnificent Ambersons,\u201d chopping 43 minutes from the cut against Welles\u2019 wishes. It was a betrayal from which he never recovered. \u201cThey destroyed \u2018Ambersons,\u2019 and destroyed me,\u201d Welles said.\n\nNetflix Bob Random and Oja Kodar.\n\nBut reality began mirroring \u201cWind\u201d all too closely. Just as his fictional character Jake encountered countless hitches in the process of making his movie, Welles faced an almost laughable series of complications. He repeatedly lost funding; an unexpected tax bill from the U.S. government and an alleged embezzlement scam on set derailed finances further. A spotty money arrangement with the brother-in-law of the Shah only complicated things anew. As the \u201cWind\u201d shoot stretched on, Welles couldn\u2019t afford to pay the crew, so his cinematographer, Gary Graver, was forced to work on adult films to pay the bills; Welles even helped Graver (working under the pseudonym Robert McCallum) by editing a lesbian sex scene in the 1975 porn film \u201c3 A.M.\u201d\n\nCasting was another issue. Weeks into filming, Welles allegedly fired Rich Little, the supporting actor who originally played Brooks. Production shut down so many times it took the crew six years to complete principal photography.\n\nEven after the last scene of the movie was shot in 1976, more bad luck ensued. Throughout the mid-\u201970s and early \u201980s, Welles wrestled over the rights to the original negative in one of the most ridiculously complicated ownership disputes in Hollywood history. A substantial chunk of the film\u2019s budget came from Astrophore, a French production company owned by Mehdi Bushehri, who also happened to be the brother-in-law of the Shah of Iran. After the Shah was overthrown in the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the \u201cWind\u201d negative \u2015 an asset of the previous regime \u2015 was impounded in a vault in Paris by Ayatollah Khomeini.\n\nWelles continued to edit his own workprint of the movie until 1983. When he died in 1985, messy legal disputes raged on. The film\u2019s three beneficiaries \u2015 Kodar, Welles\u2019 daughter Beatrice Welles and Bushehri\u2019s heirs\u2015 failed to reach an agreement over the copyright, and for the next three decades Bogdanovich, original \u201cWind\u201d producer Frank Marshall and Polish producer Filip Jan Rymsza fought to get their hands on the negative. Finally, in March 2017, Marshall and Rymsza acquired the original print from the Parisian vault, totaling over 1,000 reels of film and 100 hours of footage. That\u2019s when the daunting task of reconstructing a 40-year-old movie without its director began.\n\n\u201cIt was like dredging up the Titanic,\u201d post supervisor Ruth Hasty explains in the behind-the-scenes featurette Netflix created, \u201cA Final Cut for Orson.\u201d\n\nWelles had edited roughly 45 minutes of the footage before he died, so editor Bob Murawski, who helped restore the film, had a template for pace and style. \u201cThere was enough material Orson cut to give us a pretty good indication of what [he] had in mind for the whole picture,\u201d Bogdanovich told me. On top of Welles\u2019 workprint, they had his script, script notes and Bogdanovich and Marshall\u2019s memories from being on set.\n\nOne of the biggest post-production challenges, Marshall told me, was restoring the sound. \u201cThe first time I heard any of the film I couldn\u2019t understand 85 percent of what was being said,\u201d sound recording mixer Scott Millan explains in the featurette. The sound editing team used software to clean up the inaudible dialogue and blend original audio with ADR (Automatic Dialog Replacement) to repair everything from a single word to half a line. There\u2019s just one problem with recording ADR for a 48-year-old movie: most of the cast is no longer alive. The film hired sound-alikes, including John Huston\u2019s son, actor Danny Huston, who thankfully does a pretty excellent impersonation of his father.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite magical connecting with his voice,\u201d Huston said in the featurette as he watched his father on-screen, echoing his own voice back to him. \u201cIt brought him back to life.\u201d\n\nBeyond the few bits of ADR, some added visual effects, and a change to the opening voiceover, the final result is essentially all Welles\u2019.\n\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Castellv\u00ed / Netflix Cybill Shepherd, Orson Welles, Peter Bogdanovich, Gary Graver, Oja Kodar and Bill Weaver.\n\nToday, after nearly half a century of delays, Marshall somehow categorizes his excruciating wait as a \u201cblessing.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaking this amount of time has actually helped us to finish it the best possible way, because technology caught up with us,\u201d he told me. Years ago, he said, he might not have been able to digitize the various film stocks Welles and Graver used \u2015 35mm, 16mm, black-and-white and color. He might never have been able to restore a year\u2019s worth of almost-unusable audiotape.\n\nPotential disaster still lingered over the movie as recently as this summer. The film was pulled from Cannes Film Festival this year after French theater owners demanded a 36-month window between streaming and theatrical releases. Given that Netflix prefers to stream their movies the same day they hit theaters, and refused to change its rules for Cannes \u2015 though recently, Netflix slightly expanded the release window \u2015 the festival booted Netflix\u2019s films from the competition slate, eliminating festival awards potential. So Netflix yanked \u201cWind,\u201d among other titles, entirely.\n\nBut Marshall claims the controversy worked to the producers\u2019 advantage, giving them more time to make last-minute tweaks. \u201cMaybe it was meant to be that it took this long,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWind\u201d is getting a limited theatrical run, but most audiences will experience Welles\u2019 final film in the same place they binge shows like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cAmerican Vandal.\u201d Netflix, the company accused of murdering cinema as we know it, will be the primary purveyor of Welles\u2019 extended legacy. It will preserve the 48-year-old movie in streaming glory, making it accessible to more people than Welles could have ever imagined, some of who could care less what \u201cRosebud\u201d means.\n\n\u201cPeople who don\u2019t know pictures are going to say, \u2019What else did this guy make? He\u2019s pretty good!\u2019\u201d Bogdanovich said with a laugh.\n\nWelles might not have guessed that a DVD-subscription-service-turned-media-conglomerate would serve as his late-stage hero, but I doubt he\u2019d have a problem with how things turned out.\n\nAfter all, when press asked Welles, before production on \u201cWind\u201d even began, what kind of audience he hoped would watch his movie, Welles responded: \u201cI hope everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Other Side of the Wind\u201d is available on Netflix on Nov. 2.", "Ramin Talaie via Getty Images The New York skyline as seen from the Brooklyn Navy Yard. An early draft of the city's emissions-cutting bill would likely trigger rent increases on rent-stabilized apartments.\n\nAn early draft of New York City\u2019s landmark bill to cut climate-changing pollution from big buildings threatens to trigger rent hikes that could fracture the fragile alliance backing the legislation and upend a historic effort to shrink the carbon footprint of the nation\u2019s largest city.\n\nThe draft proposal ramps up the timeline for slashing emissions over the next 12 years, but critics say it abandons the special protections for New York\u2019s dwindling stock of rent-stabilized apartments that were set out in August under a first-of-its-kind agreement between the city\u2019s real estate lobby and affordable housing advocates.\n\nThe agreement laid out a policy framework both industry groups and activists promised to back in a bill and established a united front to support legislation to reduce the carbon dioxide spewed when heating and powering buildings by 80 percent by 2050. Adopting such a policy to decrease New York\u2019s top source of climate pollution would set a new standard for big cities around the world.\n\nHuffPost obtained a copy of the draft from a source who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to share the 10-page bill.\n\nUnder the current draft language, the bill could force owners of older rent-stabilized buildings to make expensive retrofits that qualify as \u201cmajor capital improvements\u201d \u2015 costs landlords can pass on to tenants in rent increases of up to 6 percent a year. The original agreement called for mandating \u201clow-cost, energy-saving measures that don\u2019t qualify\u201d as major capital investments for rent-stabilized buildings.\n\nAs an alternative, the draft legislation allows for those landlords to buy at least 40 percent of the building\u2019s power from renewable energy \u2015 a confusing and potentially costly loophole given that residential buildings primarily use fossil fuels for heating, not electricity.\n\n\u201cThat would lead to rent increases for regulated tenants,\u201d said Ellen Davidson, a housing lawyer at New York\u2019s Legal Aid Society.\n\nLandlords who violate the rules would face fines of up to $268 per square foot of the building \u2015 totaling $6.7 million for a 25,000-square-foot building, the minimum size affected by the regulation.\n\nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS A woman pulls a cartload of groceries to her third-floor apartment in the Red Hook Houses residential complex in Brooklyn after Superstorm Sandy -- a storm linked to climate change -- knocked out power in 2012.\n\nThe bill is only a first draft and is expected to change dramatically before it\u2019s introduced. City Councilman Costa Constantinides, the Queens legislator spearheading the bill, declined to comment. So did the Urban Green Council, a nonprofit linked to the U.S. Green Building Council that negotiated and published the initial framework agreement in August.\n\nJuan Soto, a spokesman for Council Speaker Corey Johnson, said the council \u201cspent a significant amount of time working with stakeholders on this issue and continue to process their feedback.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Council is still working on this bill,\u201d he said in an email Friday evening. \u201cTo report on early incarnations of legislation is both premature and irresponsible.\u201d\n\nBut the draft\u2019s lack of protections for rent-stabilized buildings raises red flags in a city where housing costs are already so high the homeless population surged to 76,000 last year, more than in any other city in the United States.\n\n\u201cLegislation that would cause rent hikes in rent-regulated housing through energy efficiency standards pits affordability in a city with an enormous homelessness crisis against climate pollution reductions,\u201d said Pete Sikora, a senior adviser to the grassroots nonprofit New York Communities for Change. \u201cThere would be an enormous backlash against legislation that put people out of their homes.\u201d\n\nThe state rent regulations that allow for rent hikes to match major capital investments and energy costs are slated to expire next year. If Democrats retake the state Senate in Tuesday\u2019s election, a new majority in both houses of New York\u2019s legislature could pass progressive new regulations to protect the state\u2019s remaining 1 million rent-stabilized units. New York City, where the vast majority of those apartments are located, lost more than 284,000 stabilized units between 1994 and 2016, according to Rent Guidelines Board data cited by the real estate site Curbed New York.\n\nBut that could take years, and city lawmakers are eager to pass legislation to cut building emissions in the coming months.\n\nThere would be an enormous backlash against legislation that put people out of their homes.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio (D) twice tried to mandate emissions cuts from privately owned buildings, first in 2016 and then again in 2017. But the plans went nowhere. In September 2017, the mayor released his second, more-detailed plan without coordinating with his usual environmental allies on the City Council, angering legislators who were drafting their own bills to cut emissions. They refused to back de Blasio\u2019s proposal.\n\nBut de Blasio and Johnson signaled in August that they would support a bill based on the recommendations in the agreement brokered by the Urban Green Council.\n\nSuch legislation would make New York City the leader for municipal emissions reductions at a time when policymakers are scrambling to cut climate pollution in the decade ahead. The United Nations issued a devastating report last month warning that world governments must halve emissions over the next 12 years to avoid cataclysmic global warming. Even then, the researchers found that technologies that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are required to keep warming within 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit, beyond which scientists forecast many densely populated areas \u2015 particularly coastal cities like New York \u2015 will become far less inhabitable.\n\nIn January, de Blasio announced a city lawsuit against five major oil companies over infrastructure damage from climate change and unveiled plans to divest roughly $5 billion in fossil fuel investments from the city\u2019s five pension plans. Other cities quickly followed suit, and, in July, Rhode Island became the first state to sue big oil firms. Late last month, New York state\u2019s Attorney General Barbara Underwood filed a lawsuit against Exxon Mobil Corp., accusing the country\u2019s biggest oil firm of defrauding investors by hiding the financial risks posed by climate change.", "Donald Trump\u2019s former attorney is relating shocking racist and disparaging comments he says the president made about black people.\n\nMichael Cohen tells Vanity Fair that the president\u2019s recent tirades have compelled him to reveal details from his tenure at the Trump Organization that he says show Trump\u2019s real character.\n\nCohen says he once remarked to Trump that the crowd at a presidential campaign rally was overwhelmingly Caucasian and that Trump responded, \u201cThat\u2019s because black people are too stupid to vote for me.\u201d\n\nHe also claims that after the death of South African leader Nelson Mandela, Trump challenged him to \u201cname one country run by a black person that\u2019s not a shithole,\u201d before adding, \u201cName one city.\u201d\n\nBut one of the most shocking allegations involved the first season of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d which came down to two male contestants: eventual winner Bill Rancic and Kwame Jackson, an African-American investment manager who had graduated from Harvard Business School.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018There\u2019s no way I can let this black f-g win,\u2019\u201d Cohen is quoted as saying in Vanity Fair.\n\nJackson confirmed he had heard that Trump made comments like that but replied to the magazine with a reference to \u201cBlack Panther\u201d: \u201cMy response to President Trump is simple and Wakandan.

The Labor Department unveiled the proposed regulation Friday afternoon with no comment from Secretary Alexander Acosta.\n\nUnemployment claimants are only eligible for benefits if they\u2019ve been laid off through no fault of their own after having been employed for most of the previous year. Republicans have sought to add drug-testing requirements since around 2010, shortly after the national unemployment rate reached 10 percent and the government was spending tens of billions of dollars on benefits each year.\n\nThe new regulation might violate constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure by the government, according to the National Employment Law Project.\n\n\u201cThe mere act of applying for a government program does not provide grounds to reasonably suspect a person of drug use,\u201d NELP director Christine Owens said in a statement.\n\nOwens also said the proposal seems rooted in the assumption that unemployed people are to blame for losing their jobs, which is contrary to the entire concept of unemployment insurance. \u201cDrug testing is simply a lazy way of blaming the victims of larger economic trends or corporate practices such as downsizing, outsourcing, and offshoring,\u201d she said.\n\nThe proposal stems from a 2012 compromise between congressional Democrats and Republicans. In exchange for an extension of federal unemployment compensation, which helped workers who had used up six months of state-funded benefits, Democrats agreed to let states drug test some workers.\n\nBut they left it up to the Labor Department to decide which workers could be tested, and Republicans hated the regulation that Barack Obama\u2019s Labor Department proposed in 2016. States would only have been allowed to test workers in occupations that have a public safety component, such as police officers and train operators.\n\nSo Republicans in Congress struck down the Obama regulation last year using a special procedure called the Congressional Review Act. Federal agencies are not supposed to be able to reissue the regulation in a \u201csubstantially similar\u201d fashion, making CRA resolutions an especially powerful deregulatory tool.\n\nOr so it seemed. Trump\u2019s Labor Department calls the new version of the regulation a \u201csubstantially different and more flexible approach,\u201d but experts aren\u2019t so sure.\n\nThe new rule says states can make up lists of occupations that regularly drug test workers by using almost any kind of survey by a private or government organization. Anyone who works in such an occupation could be required to pass a drug test in order to qualify for benefits. It\u2019s far broader than what the Obama administration had proposed \u2015 which, according to one interpretation, actually means it\u2019s a much stronger regulation.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s position rebuts the conventional wisdom that the CRA categorically stops agencies from reissuing public protections and has opened the door for agencies to bring back repealed protections in stronger form,\u201d said Amit Narang, a policy expert with Public Citizen, a public interest nonprofit.\n\n", "Keira Knightley is defending her decision to ban her daughter from watching some classic Disney movies.\n\nThe actress, who is currently promoting her latest film, Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Nutcracker and the Four Realms,\u201d said in October that she doesn\u2019t allow Edie, her 3-year-old with husband James Righton, to watch \u201cCinderella\u201d and \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d because she feels those classic Disney princesses set bad examples for young girls.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean she hates all Disney movies.\n\n\u201cI love \u2018Frozen,\u2019 I am 100 percent Team \u2018Frozen\u2019 and Team \u2018Moana,\u2019\u201d she told the Press Association during the premiere of her new film. \u201c\u2018Moana\u2019 is big in our house, \u2018Inside Out\u2019 is big in our house, I just wonder what Elsa (from \u2018Frozen\u2019) would say to Ariel (from \u2018The Little Mermaid\u2019) and Cinderella because Elsa has some serious opinions about Anna (her sister in \u2018Frozen\u2019) going off with a guy that she\u2019s only just met and saying she would marry him.\u201d\n\nBarcroft Media via Getty Images Keira Knightley attends the European Premiere of Disney's \"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms\" at Vue Westfield on Nov. 1 in London.\n\nShe continued: \u201cShe is like, \u2018Absolutely that is not OK,\u2019 and in fact everyone in \u2018Frozen\u2019 is not OK with that.\u201d\n\nShe then wondered how Elsa would respond to Ariel\u2019s decision to give up her voice to get closer to her love interest, Prince Eric.\n\n\u201cA man, by the way, she has only seen dance \u2019round a ship and then drown!\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s 100 percent amazing of Ariel to save the guy, I\u2019m totally up for that, but what would Elsa make of that?\u201d\n\nThe actress then channeled the Disney princess she admires: \u201cI think Elsa would be like: \u2018Babe, you\u2019ve got to get to know him better, don\u2019t give up your voice yet.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn October, the actress said on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d that she wouldn\u2019t let her girl watch \u201cCinderella\u201d or \u201cThe Little Mermaid.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Cinderella,\u2019 banned,\u201d Knightley told DeGeneres. \u201cBecause, you know, she waits around for a rich guy to rescue her.

Ted Cruz accused Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of illegally funding a caravan of Central American migrants on Friday, playing off the fears repeatedly stoked by President Donald Trump just four days ahead of the midterm election.\n\nThe Texas Republican posted a tweet urging reporters to get his Democratic challenger on record about whether O\u2019Rourke thought the migrants should be \u201callowed to cross illegally into Texas\u201d and accusing O\u2019Rourke of refusing to answer the question.\n\nThe senator went on ask if the O\u2019Rourke campaign had \u201cillegally\u201d funded the caravan, alluding to an undercover video produced by conservative trickster James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s Project Veritas. It\u2019s not clear if the video depicts any illegal activity.\n\nTwo basic Qs every reporter should ask Beto today: (1) should the \u201ccaravan\u201d be allowed to cross illegally into Texas? (Beto refuses to answer.) And (2) did your campaign dollars illegally fund their doing so? https://t.co/5HcePn3AGs \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) November 2, 2018\n\nA Project Veritas operative posing as an O\u2019Rourke campaign worker secretly recorded other O\u2019Rourke staffers talking about using prepaid campaign debit cards to buy food for asylum-seekers last week in Texas. The asylum-seekers were not part of the caravan \u2015 they were already in Texas, apparently taking shelter in churches while the government processes their legal claims.\n\nNevertheless, the Cruz campaign insisted the senator\u2019s question about \u201cfunding\u201d the caravan is fair.\n\n\u201cBeto campaign staffers confirmed they are giving supplies to immigrants who have crossed the border illegally,\u201d Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said in an email.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s not clear if those immigrants crossed the border illegally. It\u2019s legal to come to the U.S. to seek asylum. It\u2019s also legal to lodge an asylum claim after crossing the border without authorization. The immigrants in question had reportedly been dropped off at a bus station last week by federal authorities after they\u2019d been processed by immigration officials.\n\nPlus, the Federal Election Commission website says it\u2019s legal for political campaigns to donate to charity. The O\u2019Rourke campaign said it did nothing wrong, although the video\u2019s release appeared to catch them off guard.\n\n\u201cStaff members took it upon themselves to use prepaid cards from one of our more than 700 field offices to buy baby wipes, diapers, water, fruit and granola bars, and donate them to a local humanitarian nonprofit named Annunciation House that helps mothers and children in the community,\u201d O\u2019Rourke spokesman Chris Evans said. \u201cThe value was under $300 and it will be appropriately reported to the FEC.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke has also repeatedly answered questions about immigration on the campaign trail. He has called on the Trump administration to stop prosecuting asylum-seekers for immigration violations. He has urged asylum-seekers to come through legal ports of entry to make their claims \u2015 while faulting the Trump administration for deterring them from doing so, which incentivizes migrants to cross illegally.\n\nOne of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s repeated lines on the stump is that Central American asylum-seekers are \u201carresting\u201d Border Patrol agents, not the other way around \u2015 a reference to the fact that migrants who cross the border between ports of entry routinely turn themselves in to authorities to start to their legal claims.\n\nIn the Project Veritas video, O\u2019Rourke campaign staffers seem to think there might be something wrong with supplying donations, though it\u2019s hard to tell how much of their concern was actually prompted by the Project Veritas videographer herself.\n\nNewsweek Conservative trickster James O'Keefe has produced a number of questionable videos over the years.\n\nO\u2019Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, claimed that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign violated federal election rules by \u201ccovering up the true nature of spending of campaign funds and intentionally misreporting them.\u201d But he didn\u2019t produce any actual evidence of a coverup; the video is not the O\u2019Rourke campaign\u2019s FEC report.\n\nO\u2019Keefe has done a lot of questionable work over the years. His most famous videos targeted staffers for the now-defunct anti-poverty group ACORN in 2009. O\u2019Keefe claimed ACORN staffers in Baltimore told him how to claim underage migrant sex slaves on his tax returns, even though they told him he couldn\u2019t.\n\nNear the end of the O\u2019Rourke video, after 23 minutes of grainy footage, O\u2019Keefe pops up with a microphone to say he needs to make something clear.\n\n\u201cHelping immigrants who are in this country legally is not a bad thing,\u201d O\u2019Keefe said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s possible \u2015 it\u2019s possible! \u2015 conceivable that some of the immigrants featured in this story were here legally.\u201d\n\nThe recently arrived migrants who received some food and water from O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign are also unlikely to be associated with the caravan that Trump has railed against in recent days. The latter group \u2015 which includes some 2,400 children, according to UNICEF USA \u2015 is still in southern Mexico and traveling by foot. They will not reach the U.S.-Mexico border for weeks at their current pace.\n\nThe congressman noted that discrepancy in a statement denying any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThis is part of an effort to try to stoke fear and anxiety about immigrants, about asylum-seekers,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said after a rally in Lewisville, Texas, according to The Dallas Morning News. \u201cI am comfortable that the campaign is above board, that everything is being reported to the FEC, and I\u2019m going to also make sure that I understand that\u2019s going on, but from everything I\u2019ve heard, that\u2019s the sum of it.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s attack over the caravan followed multiple contentious statements from Trump, who has verbally attacked the Central American migrants and dispatched some 5,200 troops to the border in an effort to deter them. It\u2019s unclear what practical effect the troops will have, given that the U.S. military can\u2019t make immigration arrests and that Central American asylum-seekers typically turn themselves in or cross at legal ports of entry anyway.\n\nBut Trump keeps pushing the hard line against immigration that helped propel him to power. On Wednesday, the president posted a video featuring images of undocumented cop killer Luis Bracamontes and accusing Democrats of letting him into the country. In fact, Bracamontes entered illegally and was deported twice \u2015 once in 1997 and once in 2001. On Thursday, Trump said his administration was drafting a plan to keep asylum-seekers indefinitely detained in tents, again blaming Democrats for the longstanding peculiarities of U.S. law governing asylum.", "President Donald Trump has ramped up his inflammatory racist rhetoric in the final days before the pivotal midterm elections that will determine if his corrupt administration will face any oversight from Congress.\n\nBetting that fears of racial minorities will drive Republican voters to the polls, he has centered his closing pitch on a caravan of Central American migrants fleeing violence and poor crop yields in their home countries. He said, without evidence, that the caravan is filled with \u201cmany gang members\u201d and \u201cunknown Middle Easterners,\u201d dropping the previous pretense (\u201cterrorists\u201d) to reveal a fear of all members of a minority group. \u201cWomen don\u2019t want them in our country,\u201d he added, a not-so-subtle suggestion that the migrants are rapists (similar to a claim he made upon launching his presidential campaign).\n\nGuests on Fox News have speculated that migrants are carrying diseases like leprosy and that the caravan is a plot conceived of by rootless Jewish financiers seeking global domination like George Soros \u2014 the latter a paranoid conspiracy the president has also entertained. The president followed this up with a blatantly racist advertisement blaming Democrats for murders committed by an undocumented immigrant.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump rallies his fans in Columbia, Missouri, by blaming unknown forces for organizing the migrant caravan that he deems \"an invasion.\"\n\nIn all of this, Trump has emulated the outrageous, bigoted and violence-encouraging campaign waged by President Andrew Johnson in the 1866 midterms. In his \u201cSwing Around the Circle,\u201d the first time a sitting president campaigned around the country for candidates, Johnson made the election a referendum on himself, with unprecedented barnstorming speeches featuring paranoid conspiracy theories, racist demagoguery and incitement to violence.\n\nJohnson, an accidental president who came to power after an assassin killed President Abraham Lincoln and another failed to kill him, was a boorish drunk, a former slaveowner and a racist who held sympathies with the now-defeated Confederates. He vetoed legislation establishing the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, opposed the 14th Amendment, opposed giving freed black people voting rights in the South and mass-pardoned most Confederate soldiers and officials and offered them property while denying it to freed black people. All of this brought the ire of the Republican Congress, which overrode his many vetoes and passed the 14th Amendment.\n\nAnd so Johnson took to the campaign trail to defeat congressional Republicans and replace them with proponents of white supremacy. Johnson\u2019s tour began on the East Coast. As he moved westward and faced Republican-heavy districts in the Midwest that opposed his policies, he became increasingly unhinged.\n\nHe began by comparing himself to Jesus Christ and Thaddeus Stevens, the anti-slavery leader of the Republicans in Congress, to Judas Iscariot. He attacked Sen. Charles Sumner and Wendell Phillips, two abolitionists turned advocates for black suffrage. Then, at a stop in Cleveland, a heckler yelled out, \u201cHang Jeff Davis!,\u201d a call to execute the former president of the Confederacy Jefferson Davis. Johnson could not resist a reply, \u201cWhy not hang Thad Stevens and Wendell Phillips? ... Having fought traitors at the South, I am prepared to fight traitors at the North.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cSwing Around the Circle\u201d degenerated from there. Johnson continued to call for the execution of his political opponents Stevens, Phillips and Sumner. He defended recent riots in Memphis and New Orleans where white mobs killed dozens of black Americans in a racist fury by claiming that his political opponents had radicalized black Americans. They had it coming, essentially.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Andrew Johnson, the 17th President of the United States, was a white supremacist drunk who called for the execution of his political enemies.\n\n\u201cIf you will take up the riot at New Orleans and trace it back to the radical Congress, you will find that the riot at New Orleans was substantially planned,\u201d Johnson said at a stop in St. Louis.\n\nJohnson roped in the famed and beloved Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to support him on his \u201cSwing Around the Circle.\u201d Grant, disgusted by Johnson\u2019s speeches, fell ill and excused himself from the tour. According to a biography of Grant written by his aide Adam Badeau, the general believed the president \u201cfostered a spirit that engendered massacre, and afterward protected the evil-doers.\u201d\n\nPresident Johnson\u2019s defense of white massacres of black people as the product of his opponents supporting black civil rights only encouraged more violence \u2014 violence that would ultimately overtake the country and re-establish official white supremacy over the former Confederate states until the 1960s.\n\nMuch as Johnson\u2019s rhetorical leniency toward white mobs killing black Americans inspired further violence, Trump\u2019s racist midterm campaign has done the same.\n\nThe constant drumbeat of fear-mongering news about the Central American migrant caravan from the president\u2019s mouth and amplified by conservative media triggered a virulent anti-Semite, who believed that Jews like Soros and the refugee resettlement nonprofit HIAS were funding the caravan, to take up arms and attack a synagogue, killing 11 people. It was the worst anti-Semitic attack in the history of the United States.\n\nThat same week, police arrested a Florida man for mailing bombs to a litany of political figures that Trump claims as his enemies and, in some cases, promised to jail, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, 2016 Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and, of course, Soros.\n\nThe president and his supporters claim to be outraged by assertions that their rhetoric and policies have in any way incited violence from right-wing terrorists. That same week, the lawyers for a Trump-loving right-wing terrorist who planned to bomb mosques in 2016 filed a brief asking for leniency from the court because their client was seduced into terrorism by Trump\u2019s bigoted rantings.\n\nGUILLERMO ARIAS via Getty Images Two children who are part of the migrant caravan of Central American refugees that the president claims are attempting to invade the U.S. The caravan is currently stuck in southern Mexico.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s brand of rough-and-tumble verbal pummeling heightened the rhetorical stakes for people of all political persuasions,\u201d the lawyers wrote. \u201cA personal normally at a 3 on a scale of political talk might have found themselves at a 7 during the election. A person, like Patrick, who would often be at a 7 during a normal day, might \u2018go to 11.\u2019 See SPINAL TAP. That climate should be taken into account when evaluating the rhetoric that formed the basis of the government\u2019s case.\u201d\n\nNone of this is pushing Republicans away from Trump. If anything, they are drawing closer to his brand of paranoid racist incitement. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) declared on Friday that his Democratic opponent Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke may be funding the caravan with his campaign funds. Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) is running campaign ads fear-mongering about the \u201cinvasion\u201d of migrants in an election in Tennessee, which is further away from the U.S.-Mexico border than the migrant caravan is currently.\n\nJohnson\u2019s campaign of racist incitement didn\u2019t work in 1866. Instead, it became a referendum on the president\u2019s reactionary encouragement of white supremacists in the South and the passage of the 14th Amendment. The Republican Party increased its congressional majorities and, having seen the worst of the president, impeached him after further fights over the future of black civil rights in 1868.", "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you.", "The U.S. military says it has updated a \u201cwelcome booklet\u201d meant to introduce servicemembers to the culture and customs of Saudi Arabia, days after comedian Hasan Minhaj highlighted some racist language it contained.\n\n\u201cThe population of the (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) is mainly composed of descendants of indigenous tribes that have inhabited the peninsula since prehistoric times with some later mixture of Negro blood from slaves imported from Africa,\u201d read the manual, which was updated in June.\n\nThat phrase has been removed from the document and is being revised, United States Central Command spokesman Capt.

Sign up for the weekly newsletter here.\n\nDear reader,\n\nHuffPost Maghreb\u2019s Ibtissam Ouazzani has written a fascinating article about the prevalence of \u201cvirginity testing\u201d in Morocco and what it might take to stop it.\n\nThe World Health Organization and United Nations are on a mission to end the practice \u2014 an invasive physical exam performed in more than 20 countries to determine whether a woman (often a bride-to-be) has had sex. The organizations point out what might seem obvious: That the tests aren\u2019t accurate, and they violate women\u2019s rights and put their lives at risk. (Some women who have \u201cfailed\u201d the test have killed themselves or been killed by family members, the organizations point out.)\n\nAnd yet the practice persists across social classes in places like Morocco, where doctors dole out up to 10 \u201cvirginity certificates\u201d a day during the country\u2019s marriage season.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of resistance to the traditional practice, Ibtissam told me, noting that her article was widely shared among Moroccan feminist groups and others seeking to end \u201cvirginity testing.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, others criticize the WHO for trying to push Moroccans to \u2018sin and debauchery,\u2018\u201d she added. \u201cSome would even see this as the \u2018West\u2019 trying to force its culture on us.\u201d\n\nConvincing families to abandon the practice in places where a woman\u2019s virginity is so deeply valued requires a delicate approach, her article notes \u2014 one that emphasizes that opposition to virginity testing has nothing to do with promoting promiscuity or sexual liberation.\n\nThere are some signs of progress, though. \u201cWe see more and more couples getting married after being together for years and having intercourse,\u201d Ibtissam said.\n\nBut moments after typing those words, she emailed me with an addendum that suggested just how challenging this campaign to end \u201cvirginity testing\u201d in Morocco might be: \u201cIf a man [in Morocco] rapes a woman who is supposedly not a virgin, he will get a lighter sentence than he would if he had raped a virgin. We live in a country that is trying to be modern but the way people think is still attached to traditions.\u201d\n\nUntil next time,\n\nEmily\n\nTo learn more about the dangers of \u201cvirginity tests,\u201d scroll through the hefty U.N./WHO report calling for an end to the practice.\n\nHuffPost\n\nSpeaking of virginity, a new HuffPost U.S. series that identifies and answers the most-searched internet queries around the world has pinpointed what internet users in India want to know: \u201cIs it normal to bleed after losing your virginity?\u201d The Searching For Normal Series is a fascinating place to find answers, learn more about what\u2019s keeping people around the world up at night (late periods in the U.S., sweating in Brazil) and perhaps to feel a little bit less alone.

Bowers, who frequently used Gab to rant about Jews and immigrants and interact with well-known white supremacists, replied to Griffin, offering to give him a more recent address for the blogger. It is not clear whether Griffin, who goes by the name Hunter Wallace on Gab, took Bowers up on the offer. But around the time of the exchange, Griffin posted what he claimed was the blogger\u2019s real name as well as information about his family and where he lived.\n\nI knew Robert Bowers was familiar.\n\n\n\nI put this screengrab on Storyful's newswire in July.

Victims are often deluged with death threats, and are at times forced to relocate and spend their own money on security measures. Most doxers won\u2019t become mass murderers \u2014 but doxing shows a willingness to put someone at increased risk of violence by slapping a target on their back. In this case, Bowers\u2019 doxing effort preceded the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history.\n\nABC News Videos Robert Bowers used Gab to forge ties with white supremacist movement leaders.\n\nAnti-racist activists also unmask white nationalists, but their motives and messaging are generally different. After last year\u2019s deadly neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, for example, activists exposed the identities of participants online, often accompanied by their place of employment and they town where they lived. In that case, the goal was to prevent violence by blocking adherents of a violent ideology from operating in the shadows.\n\nFollowing Griffin\u2019s doxing effort, the blogger significantly cut back their activities online. \u201cI was incredibly shaken at the discovery that an alleged mass murderer was apparently sharing my information online. It\u2019s very disturbing,\u201d the blogger, who requested anonymity for security reasons, told HuffPost. \u201cWhat\u2019s more disturbing is that the people he was sharing my info with are still operating day-to-day with no consequences for their actions.\u201d\n\nGab CEO Andrew Torba did not respond to a request for comment about whether Bowers or Griffin were disciplined for coordinating doxing efforts on Gab.\n\nTorba depicts Gab as a censorship-free alternative to Twitter. He has claimed that he has a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for violence and that doxing is not allowed. But he has also recruited white supremacists and alt-right members who have been banned from Twitter.\n\nBowers, the accused Pittsburgh shooter, posted on Gab about a Jewish refugee resettlement agency bringing \u201cinvaders\u201d into the country just hours before the shooting.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered,\u201d he posted on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m going in,\u201d he wrote. Torba removed Bowers\u2019 account only after the Pittsburgh massacre.\n\nTorba\u2019s willingness to enforce Gab\u2019s anti-doxing policies has been similarly selective. Earlier this year, he banned white nationalist failed Senate candidate Paul Nehlen \u2014 whom Torba was a fan of \u2014 after Nehlen revealed the identity of racist Twitter troll \u201cRicky Vaughn.\u201d But the Gab CEO has repeatedly looked the other way when the targets of harassment \u2014 including Hayden, a former Newsweek reporter who covered the far-right \u2014 were critics of Torba and his allies.\n\nGab went offline earlier this week after several internet service companies abandoned the site in response to the Pittsburgh shooting. The Gab Twitter account, which Torba often manages, claimed the site would be back online this weekend \u2014 with a dove in its logo in honor of the synagogue shooting victims and their families.", "Missouri Sen.

The primary group leading the \u201cyes\u201d effort on Prop B, Raise Up Missouri, has received more than $6.5 million in contributions, including more than $800,000 last month. The bulk of that money \u2015 $4.6 million \u2015 has come from the Sixteen Thirty Fund, a liberal Washington-based 501(c)(4) organization that doesn\u2019t have to disclose its donors.\n\nErin Schaff / Reuters Sen. Claire McCaskill is in a close battle to get re-elected next week.\n\nThat\u2019s not an outrageous amount of money in the world of modern political campaigns, but it appears to be more than went to the \u201cyes\u201d camp pushing any other minimum wage ballot initiative in either the 2016 or 2014 election cycle.\n\nIt also seems like a lot of money considering there is no organized campaign against Prop B. The state chamber of commerce has pretty much sat this one out, preoccupied perhaps with a different ballot measure that would tighten up rules on lobbying and campaign contributions. That means the pro-Prop B message in TV ads and direct mail is barely being countered.\n\nThe Sixteen Thirty Fund didn\u2019t respond to questions on its donations to the minimum wage cause.\n\nMike Saltsman, managing director of the Washington-based Employment Policies Institute, an industry-backed group that opposes minimum wage hikes, said he thinks the backers of the pro-Prop B campaign are hoping it will help drive turnout that boosts McCaskill.\n\n\u201cIn an election year with a hotly contested Senate race, if I\u2019m the folks on the other side of the aisle, I\u2019m probably thinking about an all-of-the-above strategy \u2015 what are all the different things we can throw at this,\u201d Saltsman said. \u201cThe minimum wage ended up, I think, being one check box on that list.\u201d\n\nMcCaskill may have gotten help from a similar minimum wage initiative when she narrowly beat incumbent Republican Jim Talent in 2006 to first win her Senate seat, as the Associated Press recently noted. That measure, also known as Proposition B, passed by a whopping 3-1 margin.\n\nMcCaskill ended up defeating Talent by fewer than 50,000 votes. \u201cWe know that when an issue directly impacts your pocketbook, you\u2019re more likely to go out and vote,\u201d Jack Cardetti, a Democratic consultant who was part of McCaskill\u2019s 2006 campaign, told AP.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to unpack the effects that other minimum wage initiatives have had (or not had) on the ballot. Such referendums did very well in 2014 and 2016, with four passing in each cycle, including in deep red states, and sometimes by huge margins. Yet the measures did not seem to do much on the whole for the Democratic Party, suggesting a lot of people can support a minimum wage hike while still casting votes for Republicans who don\u2019t support a minimum wage hike.", "ASSOCIATED PRESS Democrats have been on the offense about health care for the first time since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010.\n\nFor the first time since the Affordable Care Act became law, Democrats and their messaging in favor of it have dominated the political conversation.\n\nDemocrats have spent twice as much as Republicans have on health care ads this cycle, according to numbers compiled by Kantar Media/CMAG for HuffPost.\n\nAnd Democrats have aired 132,238 pro-Obamacare ads, compared with 89,815 anti-Obamacare ads.\n\nHuffPost Democrats spent significantly more on health care ads this cycle than Republicans have.\n\nThe turnaround is striking from past election cycles. Before Obamacare passed, Democrats made health care their issue. For example, before the 2008 election, Barack Obama\u2019s campaign aired one ad on health care 24,000 times. But in 2012, when he was running for re-election, his campaign had just one health care ad.\n\nAfter Obama and Democrats in Congress pushed for the law, Republicans went on the offense and made repealing it their goal. They riled up their conservative base against the law, and it paid off electorally.\n\nThe focus was clear in the spending on ads: Republicans spent far more on health care ads than Democrats did.\n\nHuffPost There were also more pro-Obamacare ads this cycle, for the first time since the law passed.\n\nThis year health care is Democrats\u2019 top message. Republicans failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, despite controlling the White House and both chambers in Congress. And the law is far more popular than it once was, thanks in large part to provisions like protecting people with pre-existing conditions and ensuring that young people can stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance longer.\n\nRepublicans have tried to obscure their votes in favor of repeal as well \u2014 another indication of how much public opinion has shifted. President Donald Trump and members of Congress have claimed that they, not Democrats, support protections for people with pre-existing conditions, even though legislation they\u2019ve backed and administrative changes they\u2019re making do just the opposite.\n\nIn places like the Rust Belt states, where Democratic senators are fighting to hold on to their seats, groups like Working America \u2015 a nonlabor affiliate of the AFL-CIO \u2015 say health care remains the big issue they hear about on the ground.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve tried to do is not make it an \u2018us versus them\u2019 but \u2018what\u2019s on your mind?\u2019\u201d said the organization\u2019s executive director, Matt Morrison. \u201cAnd for us, that\u2019s really been centered on health care and access to affordable health care.\u201d\n\nLast month, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) said he wants to get another chance to repeal Obamacare, citing the failure to do so as his main disappointment.", "Alec Baldwin was arrested Friday in New York City after a dispute over a parking spot allegedly became physical, a New York Police Department spokeswoman confirmed to HuffPost.\n\nBaldwin, 60, allegedly struck an unidentified 49-year-old man, who then went to a hospital, in the city\u2019s West Village neighborhood. The man supposedly pulled in to a parking spot Baldwin had been waiting for, according to a local NBC affiliate.\n\nCharges against the actor will likely include third-degree assault and harassment, police said. A spokeswoman for the actor declined to comment.\n\nBaldwin strongly denied punching anyone over a parking dispute in a pair of Friday afternoon tweets.\n\n\u201cNormally, I would not comment on something as egregiously misstated as today\u2019s story,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever, the assertion that I punched anyone over a parking spot is false. I wanted to go on the record stating as much.\u201d\n\nHe told police that a family member was saving a parking spot when a man driving a Saab pulled into it, The Associated Press reported.\n\nBaldwin has enjoyed renewed popularity for his blustering impersonations of President Donald Trump on NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d The president has famously lashed out at the actor over his depictions.\n\nAsked for comment on Baldwin\u2019s arrest, Trump told reporters, \u201cI wish him luck.\u201d\n\nTrumps message to Alec Baldwin: \u201cI wish him luck\u201d pic.twitter.com/aZe1BFGURl \u2014 Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) November 2, 2018\n\nBaldwin\u2019s history of antagonistic behavior is well-documented.\n\nThe actor was taken into police custody in 2014 for riding his bike the wrong way down Fifth Avenue and arguing with officers, who charged him with disorderly conduct.\n\nBaldwin also received backlash in 2013 for lobbing a gay slur against a photographer attempting to capture his wife and infant son on camera. MSNBC, where he hosted a talk show at the time, subsequently chose to cancel the show. Two years earlier the actor had been booted from a plane in Los Angeles for refusing to stop using his phone.\n\nIn 1996, Baldwin went all the way to trial over a misdemeanor battery charge, and was acquitted by a California jury that decided he was defending himself when he struck a man attempting to photograph his family.\n\nThe actor\u2019s oldest daughter, 23-year-old Ireland, once defended her dad\u2019s temper on Twitter, where she said he\u2019s \u201cgrown tremendously\u201d in his struggle with \u201canger management issues.\u201d", "A federal judge in Georgia on Friday ordered state Secretary of State Brian Kemp to establish additional procedures to guarantee that voters flagged by the state as potential noncitizens can vote in the 2018 election if they can prove their citizenship.\n\nThe decision from U.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross is a win for voting rights groups who are suing the state over its so-called \u201cexact match\u201d system for registering new voters. The ruling is expected to affect 3,141 people who registered but whose registrations were considered pending because the state couldn\u2019t verify their citizenship. Overall, there are about 53,000 people whose voter registrations are pending because of a system that critics say is inaccurate and discriminatory.\n\n\u201cFrom the perspective of these voters, every one of these 3,000 individual voters has an individual and constitutional right to vote,\u201d said Danielle Lang, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center representing the plaintiffs in the suit. \u201cElections in the United States are regularly decided by smaller margins than that and every vote counts.\u201d\n\nThe ruling orders Kemp to allow people to vote if they present proof of citizenship to the county registrar before voting, or to a poll manager or deputy registrar at the polls. If someone shows up at the polls without proof of citizenship, election officials have to either let them return with proof or let them cast a provisional ballot. If someone casts a provisional ballot, they have until Friday after the election to verify their citizenship.\n\nVoting rights have emerged as a major flashpoint in Georgia\u2019s close gubernatorial race between Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams. An Associated Press analysis found that of the 53,000 people with pending voter registrations, nearly 70 percent are black, and Abrams has accused Kemp of trying to suppress votes. He has strongly denied the accusation.\n\nIn Georgia, legal permanent residents can get a driver\u2019s license. If a legal permanent resident then became a citizen and registered to vote, however, the state\u2019s driver\u2019s license database was still flagging them as a noncitizen.\n\nWhen someone registers to vote in Georgia, the state takes their information and matches it against either the state driver\u2019s license database or a federal Social Security database to verify citizenship and identity. If the information isn\u2019t an exact match, or if someone is flagged as a potential noncitizen, the person is sent a notice informing them that their registration is incomplete and they need to provide additional documentation to vote.\n\nMost of the people on the list could vote if they showed up at the polls with ID. But those whose citizenship status was in question had to show proof of citizenship to a deputy registrar to cast a ballot. Those deputy registrars aren\u2019t always available at the polls, Lang said. Georgia officials maintained in the suit that there were other ways for people whose citizenship was under question to vote, but Ross expressed skepticism that those alternatives were being executed.\n\nThe citizenship verification process also disproportionately affected people of color. Michael McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida, analyzed the voters and found Asian applicants made up 27 percent of those flagged for citizenship, even though they make up just 2.1 percent of Georgia\u2019s voter pool. Latino applicants made up 17 percent of those flagged, even though they account for 2.8 percent of registered voters in Georgia. Whites, who are 54 percent of Georgia\u2019s registered voters, only accounted for 13.7 percent of the list.\n\nRoss ordered Kemp to take additional steps to educate voters about what to do if they are eligible and have been flagged as a noncitizen. She said he had to issue a press release and update his website to show how people who have been flagged can verify their citizenship status and vote. She also said he had to direct local election officials on how they can verify citizenship, and require county election boards to post a list of acceptable forms of proof of citizenship.", "\u201cThe Princess Switch\u201d \u2015 Vanessa Hudgens stars as two identical people who decide to switch lives during the Christmas season.

The Wall Street Journal had a truly awesome story about Netflix this week that dove deep into how the mysterious \u201calgorithm\u201d decides whether shows will live or die. I\u2019ve been waiting for this kind of story for a long time. I highly recommend reading it if you\u2019re into \u201cNetflix news.\u201d One interesting detail, though \u2015 the algorithm really, really wanted to cancel \u201cGlow\u201d and it became an internal fight over whether it made sense to keep the show around solely for the critical response.\n\n2. After that huge story came out, Netflix bombarded the press with announcements. I try to tag every Netflix story that comes out each week to make these rankings and have noticed that whenever a \u201cbig story drops,\u201d Netflix appears to try to bury it with a couple dozen new storylines. I\u2019ll share just a few of the best ones without comment:\n\n\u2022 \u201cChilling Adventures of Sabrina\u201d will have a surprise holiday episode.\n\n\u2022 Netflix might offer a cheaper subscription option.\n\n\u2022 The trailer for \u201cRoma\u201d debuted.\n\n\u2022 Cardi B, Chance the Rapper and T.I. will have their own talent show, \u201cRhythm + Flow,\u201d searching for the next great hip-hop star.\n\n\u2022 Netflix will partner with Paramount for more blockbuster-esque movies.\n\n\u2022 A trailer for a new Jennifer Aniston movie called \u201cDumplin\u2019\u201d debuted.\n\n\u2022 This wasn\u2019t a \u201cNetflix announcement,\u201d but it was cool \u2015 Hasan Minhaj criticized the Netflix show \u201cThe Bodyguard\u201d on his own Netflix show, \u201cPatriot Act.\u201d\n\n3. Scheduling Announcements: Netflix canceled \u201cThe Good Cop\u201d after one season. The \u201cDark\u201d creators will have a new project called \u201c1899.\u201d Vox\u2019s \u201cExplained\u201d will get a second season.", "\u201cYou can never forget, can you, Carl Reissman?\u201d\n\nThose are the first words of \u201cMaster Race,\u201d a 1955 comic by Bernie Krigstein, Al Feldstein and Jack Davis. Spoken by an omniscient narrator, the vague question drags readers into its opening panels. \u201cEven here... in America... Ten years and thousands of miles away from your Native Germany,\u201d it continues. \u201cYou can never forget those Bloody War Years.\u201d\n\nThe title appears boldly atop the first page, cut in half by a miniature black swastika. Below is Carl Reissman himself, a white man in a khaki trench coat and fedora, descending into a subway station with his hands in his pockets. He buys a ticket and enters through a turnstile just in time to catch his train roaring into the station, an \u201conrushing steel monster.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you frightened, Carl?\u201d the hovering voice asks, the second question more off-putting than the first. \u201cThat was a long time ago! This is America. You\u2019re safe now! You\u2019re free.\u201d\n\nThat assurance \u2015 that the Holocaust is a horror of another time and place \u2015 is familiar to many American Jews. In 2018, however, it\u2019s an increasingly impotent claim. Particularly after the October massacre of 11 Jews in a Pittsburgh synagogue, which triggered a sickening sense of deja vu for so many. The Holocaust might be in the past, but its demons are far from locked there with it.\n\n\u201cThese times are not a small bit chilling,\u201d author and cartoonist Craig Yoe said.\n\nAlong with Neal Adams and Rafael Medoff, Yoe is co-editor of We Spoke Out: Comics and the Holocaust, a compilation of comics made in the 1950s, \u201960s and \u201970s, visualizing atrocities of history through graphic panels and text bubbles. Contained within are comics that emerged years before public schools began widely teaching the events of the Holocaust, before they were immortalized in films like \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d and graphic novels like Art Spiegelman\u2019s \u201cMaus.\u201d\n\n\u201cComic book creators were really unsung pioneers in Holocaust education,\u201d Medoff, a historian and the director of the David S. Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies in Washington, said. \u201cThey really did speak out at a time when most other people didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFrom \"We Spoke Out\" \"Holocaust 1,\" from April 1981\n\nBefore television, before the sprawl of the internet, comics were a medium for binging, the stuff parents worried would rot their teens\u2019 brains and corrupt innocence. The reasons were twofold: Comics were easy to produce, printed at a breakneck pace by publishers. And the readership was there to greet them.\n\n\u201cKids weren\u2019t using their money to buy books,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThey were buying comics.\u201d\n\nAs a result, writers and artists from the 1950 to 1980s were given \u201ctremendous freedom\u201d to concoct stories as they wished, Yoe said. Overworked, underpaid and eager to churn out the next hit, creators addressed grisly topics other fields didn\u2019t dare touch, unafraid to tell the spine-chilling tales that gripped readers.\n\n\u201cComic book people are not in the business of crusading,\u201d Neal Adams told HuffPost over the phone. \u201cThey\u2019re in the business of telling stories and getting paid at the end of the week. Running across subject matter like this, it\u2019s really very little more than business as usual.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubject matter like this\u201d included Hitler, the Third Reich and the 6 million Jews murdered in concentration camps. These historical atrocities became plot points in Marvel and DC comics, from Batman to X-Men to Captain Marvel. In the 1980 Captain America issue \u201cNight of the Nazi,\u201d the Captain\u2019s landlady, Anna, recalls painful memories from her time in Diebenwald, where she played in the concentration camp orchestra. Some real-life camps had such compulsory ensembles, whose music would accompany prisoners\u2019 whippings and executions.\n\nOne day, in 1980 Brooklyn, Anna runs into Dr. Klaus Mendelhaus, also known as \u201cthe Butcher of Diebenwald,\u201d who forced her into sexual slavery. She faints from the shock. Mendelhaus kidnaps her and brings her to an abandoned church, where she learns of his intention to start a new Nazi regime. Just then, Captain America soars in with a \u201cKraash!\u201d and battles the hoard of Nazis one by one.\n\n\u201cI can hate too,\u201d Captain America says as he smashes a cluster of Nazis with a wooden frame. \u201cI hate everything you stand for!\u201d In the end, Anna and Captain America have the butcher surrounded. Anna points the gun toward her former captor as Captain America begs her not to shoot.\n\n\u201cMurder is the only solution left...\u201d she says. \u201cThis butcher taught me that.\u201d With a \u201cblam blam\u201d she shoots him dead.\n\nAccording to Adams, these comics weren\u2019t necessarily created with a moral imperative in mind. Yet Yoe suspects \u201cmany working-stiff artists and writers have an ingrained social conscious,\u201d and \u201cthese comics reflect their defiant little subterfuge against evil.\u201d\n\nAfter all, Jewish people factored prominently in the nascent comic book industry. \u201cHarry Donenfeld published Jerry Seigel and Joe Shuster\u2019s story of a welcomed immigrant, Superman,\u201d Yoe said. \u201cBob Kane co-created Batman. Stan Lee, with Jack Kirby created the X-Men.\u201d Of the 18 stories in We Spoke Out, 11 were written by Jews.\n\nvia \"We Spoke Out\" Batman #237 \"Night of The Reaper,\" from Decembe 1971\n\nMost of the comics featured in We Spoke Out adhere to the norms of the genre, juxtaposing superheroes in capes with SS soldiers wearing swastika armbands. Imaginary visions of Robin battling the Grim Reaper live just pages away from horrible images of mass graves and medical torture. Comic books\u2019 typically sensational flourishes take a backseat to the very real events described because, as Adams put it, \u201cthere is little about the Holocaust you can sensationalize.\u201d\n\nNot every comic written about the Holocaust appropriately balanced education and entertainment, a reality the co-editors kept in mind when selecting the works for their book. \u201cIn one 1950s horror comic, the Jewish victims came back from the dead as vampires to bite Nazis,\u201d Medoff said. \u201cYou can see why we didn\u2019t include that one in We Spoke Out.\u201d\n\nThe comics that made it in, however, combined history, fantasy and emotion to boil an unfathomable historical nightmare down to stories that American youth would devour. As Medoff added, \u201cthese comic book stories can be just as effective today as they were when they were first published, because the problems they\u2019re addressing never completely go away.\u201d\n\nYoe described \u201cMaster Race\u201d as the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d of comic books. It certainly catches the reader off guard when it\u2019s revealed that the protagonist Carl \u2015 who finally, in America, is safe and free \u2015 was not a Jewish prisoner but a Nazi commander at the Belsen concentration camp.\n\n\u201cDo you remember, Carl?\u201d the narrator continues. \u201cDo you remember the awful smell of the gas chambers that hourly annihilated hundreds and hundreds of your countrymen? Do you remember the stinking odor of human flesh burning in the ovens... Men\u2019s... Women\u2019s... Children\u2019s... People you once knew and talked to and drank beer with?...\u201d\n\nBeneath the text, men and women shuffle about town, separated from the camp by a yellow wall. They tuck their faces into their coats and breathe into handkerchiefs to mask the stench.\n\nThe narrator proceeds to haunt Reissman with reminders of the evils he committed. He grows more panicked upon recognizing another passenger on the train, a gaunt man in all-black. As the train grinds to a halt, the man in black catches Reissman\u2019s gaze and screams, \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d\n\nReissman rushes off the train and sprints through the station, with the man in black trailing close behind. \u201cRun... As you ran from Belsen, Carl!\u201d the narrator howls. A train approaches. Reissman, running wildly through the platform, loses his balance and falls onto the tracks. A panel focuses on the man in black\u2019s face as the train zooms by, crushing Reissman beneath it. A crowd gathers, but the man denies knowing Reissman at all. \u201cHe was a perfect stranger...\u201d he says, turning his back to the reader.", "We need to lie down.\n\nNew York City comedian Joon Chung released a belly-laugh-inducing Ali Wong parody entitled \u201cThird Trimester,\u201d a clip that imagines what Wong\u2019s third Netflix special would look like.\n\nHonestly, if Wong has a follow-up special that looks anything like this one, we\u2019re so in.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want more kids. But Netflix said I had to be pregnant.

He\u2019s even got an outfit worthy of becoming next year\u2019s Halloween costume for every Asian-American chick out there.\n\nChung told HuffPost that, after noticing Wong was pregnant for both of her comedy specials, \u201cthe parody was just staring me right in the face. The rule of three!\u201d\n\n\u201cAli in those specials is such a character. Her dress! Her dance moves! Her stories about eating butt!\u201d he said. \u201cIf I only hit two out of three of those, people would\u2019ve still laughed. That\u2019s credit to Ali for making her comedy so distinct and funny.\u201d\n\nChung also said that with Wong\u2019s rise and visibility in the entertainment space, he felt that there\u2019s finally \u201csomeone from this generation I can impersonate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad we now have an updated Asian reference in pop culture who isn\u2019t a vicious dictator,\u201d he said.\n\nTo be clear, the parody was made out of serious love for Wong. Chung first watched Wong\u2019s standup at a New York bar show when he began his own comedy career. Back then, he says, she was \u201ca force\u201d and has since loved her specials as well.\n\nAs a Wong fan, he has a special shoutout for the beloved creator of the #traphisass method.", "HBO and stars of the network\u2019s hit fantasy drama \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d are not pleased that President Donald Trump invoked the show in a tweet.\n\nOn Friday, Trump tweeted a meme that said \u201cSanctions Are Coming,\u201d inspired by the show\u2019s ubiquitous \u201cWinter Is Coming\u201d tag line.

Under a new plan, the city would allow the rising water to come in to the city, rather than fighting to keep it out.\n\nBy Rebecca Beitsch\n\nTo protect itself from a devastating flood, Boston was considering building a massive sea wall, cutting north to south through nearly 4 miles of Boston Harbor, taking $11 billion and at least 30 years to build. But a new plan unveiled in October represents a 180-degree turn: Instead of fighting to keep the water out, the city is letting it come in.\n\nBoston Mayor Martin Walsh, a Democrat, announced the city would be scrapping the idea of a sea wall in favor of, among other things, a system of waterfront parks and elevation of some flood-prone areas. The city will add 67 new acres of green space along the water and restore 122 tidal acres.\n\nThe idea is to give people access to the shoreline when the weather is nice, but when the parks get flooded \u2014 well, it\u2019s not that big of a deal.\n\nAs climate change forces cities to grapple with rising sea levels and increasingly powerful storms, coastal cities must prepare for a heightened likelihood of flooding, whether tidal flooding from rising sea levels or a hurricane that could dump inches of rain in a short period of time.\n\nFor the last hundred years, protecting neighborhoods has often meant relying on sea walls \u2014 large, concrete barriers designed to withstand strong waves and rising waters. Beyond not being particularly attractive, they are expensive, can cause erosion and harm marine life.\n\nCity planners now say they are increasingly turning to methods aligned with the Dutch concept of \u201cliving with water.\u201d Instead of resisting water, cities are channeling it to where they want it to go. Boston\u2019s reimagined waterfront would be designed to handle at least 21 inches of sea-level rise, which the city anticipates by 2050.\n\n\u201cBesides taking decades to complete, a barrier would bring its own set of serious ecological issues,\u201d Walsh recently told a crowd at the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. \u201cShoreline projects are more feasible and more effective ways to increase our city\u2019s resilience. \u2026 This is our vision of a resilient Boston. It\u2019s a system not of barricades but of beaches \u2014 and parks and trails and open spaces.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, cities on coasts from Florida to Hawaii are continuing to repair sea walls and build new ones as climate disasters loom. In areas that have long been heavily reliant on such walls, it can be difficult to change course, particularly when industry relies on being able to navigate nearby waters.\n\nBut planners are working to incorporate strategies called \u201csoft solutions\u201d in contrast to harder infrastructure like sea walls. Similar projects are being planned across the Hampton Roads area in Virginia, home to Norfolk and Virginia Beach, which is one of the nation\u2019s most at-risk areas for flooding. Tide gauges there show the water level is 14 inches higher than it was in 1930.\n\nDowntown Norfolk is protected by a sea wall that was built in the 1960s for $5 million but now protects about $800 million worth of infrastructure. The Army Corps of Engineers and the city are assessing plans to replace or reinforce that wall. The city also is developing plans for a series of parks and wetlands in other portions of the city.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new movement,\u201d said Michelle Covi, an assistant professor of ocean, earth and atmospheric sciences at Old Dominion University, in Norfolk, who helped develop plans in the Hampton Roads area. \u201cEven in the Army Corps of Engineers, they\u2019ve accepted this as a way to protect valuable infrastructure but also allow us to have a connection with the water.\u201d\n\nKyle Spencer, the deputy resilience officer for Norfolk, said the city hopes to create more parks outside its urban core that are protected with earthen berms that can be raised by adding dirt and can serve as walking and bike paths along the water. Wetlands can be created to help protect those berms, and the city plans to also set up oyster colonies to help keep the water clean and protect the vegetation behind them.\n\nIn Boston, the city proposes elevating areas along 47 miles of shoreline, such as Charlestown\u2019s Main Street and downtown\u2019s Harborwalk. The city also distributed drawings showing berms and terraced walls leading down to the waterfront.\n\nThe city\u2019s shift away from a big sea wall was sparked in large part by research at the Sustainable Solutions Lab at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. The aptly named \u201cFeasibility of Harbor-wide Barrier Systems\u201d report laid out the time and expense of a wall \u2014 along with a host of navigational and environmental issues.\n\n\u201cWe found that, dollar for dollar, we could have the same amount of protection for much less cost, and in doing so also invest in our neighborhoods and have more green space,\u201d said Rebecca Herst, director of the lab. She described the parks as a twin solution \u2014 those along the shore can rebound quickly if flooded, while further inland, having less concrete and more permeable surfaces can help absorb water.\n\nSuch solutions may be far cheaper than sea walls, but they still will be expensive.\n\nWalsh said the city will devote 10 percent of its capital budget to climate change projects, about $16 million a year. The consensus among supporters of the plan is that it won\u2019t be enough. The city also is seeking federal money and is in the early stages of determining the private sector\u2019s role.\n\nWalsh made the announcement at a chamber of commerce meeting, because he wants to bring the business community on board.\n\nWhile local environmental groups lauded the plan, the Charles River Watershed Association said it didn\u2019t go far enough, and that developers should face stronger building requirements and even restrictions on where they can build.\n\nSea Wall Fights\n\nSea walls still may be necessary in some circumstances.\n\nThe Army Corps of Engineers recently unveiled options for protecting New York Harbor from flooding and storms like Hurricane Sandy, which caused massive damage in 2012. One of the proposals calls for a 5-mile sea wall from Sandy Hook in New Jersey to Breezy Point in New York.\n\nThe scope of that sea wall would be far beyond anything either state has evaluated previously, and the proposal would include smaller barriers and levees to help connect the system that would run the length of the outer harbor.\n\nAlternatives include a smaller series of inner harbor gates or six small barriers with lots of levies. One option proposes no barriers, just nature-based solutions along the shorelines.\n\nSome environmentalists and officials who help areas prepare for climate change have already expressed concern about the early proposals. The Natural Resources Defense Council said offshore storm surge barriers would \u201cstrangle the life\u201d out of the area\u2019s waterways.\n\nBeth Gibbons, executive director of the American Society of Adaptation Professionals, said cities in the region have turned to greener solutions after Hurricane Sandy, and pointed to Governor\u2019s Island which, remodeled to include a larger park, will return to its geological purpose as a barrier island. She cautioned that adding a sea wall, while protective in some areas, could lead to problems in others.\n\n\u201cWhen you put up a sea wall, there\u2019s an end,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen time and again that water will find its path. If you put up a sea wall, you will likely be making choices about who is protected and who is not. You\u2019re picking winners and losers, and that has to be done with a lot of care.\u201d\n\nOnce a sea wall is in place, it can be difficult to pursue other options.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of our legacy,\u201d said James Murley, the chief resilience officer for Miami-Dade County. Canals with cement walls weren\u2019t viewed as drainage but as an amenity to connect homeowners to waterfront recreation.\n\nAcross South Florida, local governments are looking to maintain existing sea walls while expanding green infrastructure where it makes sense. Other cities are making similar calculations.\n\nHawaii recently approved a new sea wall on Maui for the first time in almost a decade. Oceanfront condo owners whose property would be protected supported the wall, while environmentalists sued to stop it. Elsewhere in the state, the government will be paying to repair crumbling sea walls.\n\nThe state initially fought having to take over the costs of fixing a wall near Honolulu, but Hawaii\u2019s Supreme Court ruled the government would be responsible because the wall has become a beach access point. The legislature will still be responsible for doling out funds to repair sea walls.\n\nIn Norfolk, Spencer said the city is debating whether to add height to its existing sea wall or replace it. City officials in San Francisco will ask voters to approve a $425 million bond issue to upgrade its hundred-year-old sea wall. But the city also has some projects in the works to protect shorelines, such as planting oyster and eelgrass beds at least 150 meters offshore.\n\nSkip Stiles, director of Norfolk-based Wetlands Watch, which promotes nature-based solutions to sea-level rise, said the city is too developed and too dependent on Navy activities to abandon sea walls in favor of greener solutions.", "ProPublica HuffPost and ProPublica want to hear about any problems you encounter at the polls.\n\nHuffPost is partnering with ProPublica\u2019s Electionland project as part of a reporting collaboration to write about access to the ballot box in the 2018 elections.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united. Can you imagine why someone might be swayed by hate speech rhetoric?\n\nPractical ways to manage hate speech", "A day after President Donald Trump warned that migrants in a U.S.-bound caravan risk being shot if they throw rocks, a White House spokeswoman claimed on Fox News that there\u2019s \u201ca daily caravan\u201d entering the country.\n\nWhite House director of strategic communications Mercedes Schlapp appeared on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d Friday to drive home the president\u2019s anti-immigrant message in the days before the midterm elections.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now is you\u2019re having this influx of illegal aliens,\u201d Schlapp said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about 1,000 to 2,000 illegal aliens crossing our border daily.

The virus, which is transmitted through touch and contact with those infected, ripped through the population, infecting over 10,600 and killing more than 4,800 people.\n\nDonald Trump, then best known as a reality TV host who had relentlessly pushed the birtherism conspiracy about President Barack Obama, jumped on the issue. But he didn\u2019t intervene to help the nation that was founded by freed American slaves and already debilitated from 13 years of war. Instead, Trump called for a ban on entry into the U.S. for not only Africans but also American citizens, relief workers, doctors and nurses who had gone to Liberia to help. Trump said they \u201cmust suffer the consequences\u201d for providing aid.\n\nThe U.S. cannot allow EBOLA infected people back. People that go to far away places to help out are great-but must suffer the consequences! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 2, 2014\n\nEven after facts were released about how to contain the virus, Trump went on to spread misinformation about immigrants, suggesting Africans were just waiting to infiltrate the U.S. with a global killing agent that would take American lives if we didn\u2019t shut the borders. He did everything he could to make \u201cAfrican\u201d synonymous with \u201cEbola,\u201d and therefore a threat, preying on the fear of illness that could potentially hit American people on American soil.\n\nHow many Americans were infected by the Ebola virus? Four. And how many died of the virus? One.\n\nBut to hear Trump tell it, every African coming into the country was suspected of having Ebola and should be turned away. The fearmongering caught on. I hadn\u2019t been to Liberia in a year, but I could see the sudden unease in people\u2019s eyes if I mentioned I was from Liberia. I am a U.S. citizen, but as an African immigrant, I was once again seen as \u201cother.\u201d\n\nAt the time, these were the racist rantings of a celebrity billionaire just beginning to explore a presidential run. Thankfully, the country had leadership with a moral backbone \u2015 President Obama \u2015 that recognized that the best way to contain the disease was to fight it in West Africa, and America joined the global coalition to help solve the crisis. America did not shut its borders as Trump proposed.\n\nFlash-forward to today. It\u2019s November 2018, four years later, and I see so much of the same fearmongering around the migrant caravan as it makes its way toward the U.S.-Mexico border. And now, the hateful language and policy prescriptions that go along with it are coming from the White House.\n\nDays before our midterm elections, Trump has once again made the immigrant the boogeyman that \u201creal\u201d Americans must fight. Instead of using America\u2019s might to offer aid to desperate people fleeing violence in Central America, his rhetoric \u2015 and that of his allies \u2015 peddles misinformation of Islamic terrorists and lepers among the group, all working to destroy or infect our great, pure nation. He has ordered over 5,000 active-duty American service members to the border to prevent the supposed onslaught.\n\nNever mind that we know the caravan is largely made up of women and children seeking safety from violence in their home countries and that, of the estimated 4,000 of them trekking northward, only a small fraction will ever reach the U.S. border.\n\nImmigrants are once again Trump\u2019s target to vilify, used to stoke fears and rile up his base. His latest tactic? Threatening to take away birthright citizenship, a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. And Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has quickly picked up the torch, announcing that he\u2019s ready to introduce legislation to do the same.\n\nAs Election Day looms, Americans of all stripes and backgrounds must use our ballots to showcase who we are. Trump is betting that by embracing fear and closing doors, we will somehow become more American. He is willing for us to lose our humanity as we search for nationality.\n\nIn 2014, after the midterm elections came and went, the Ebola scare rhetoric disappeared. But I remember being so proud to be part of an America that responded to a global health crisis with aid and humanity; we never gave in to the fear.", "The body of journalist Jamal Khashoggi may have been dissolved in acid after he was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, an adviser to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told a Turkish newspaper this week.\n\nThe adviser, Yasin Aktay, said that\u2019s why the body of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and U.S. resident, was cut into pieces. Khashoggi disappeared shortly after entering the consulate Oct. 2 to obtain documents for his planned marriage, with Saudi officials giving shifting explanations for his death.\n\n\u201cAccording to the latest information we have, the reason they dismembered his body is to dissolve it easier,\u201d Aktay said in a statement to the Hurriyet Daily News, Reuters and the BBC reported Friday.\n\nThe statement bolsters a report by The Washington Post on Wednesday that authorities believed Khashoggi\u2019s body may have been dismembered and immersed in acid \u2015 either at the consulate or nearby, possibly in a well.\n\n\u201cKhashoggi\u2019s body was not in need of burying,\u201d said a senior Turkish official, who spoke to the Post on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe official said investigators do not believe Saudi Arabia\u2019s official story on what happened to the body. Saudi officials have acknowledged that Kashoggi was killed in the consulate on Oct. 2, but say the assailants gave the remains to a third party.\n\nIstanbul\u2019s chief prosecutor, Irfan Fidan, said this week that Khashoggi was immediately strangled when he arrived at the consulate. Earlier Turkish media reports said audio recordings captured Khashoggi being tortured before his death.\n\nFidan demanded on Wednesday that Saudi officials reveal the location of the body.\n\nHatice Cengiz, Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee, on Friday pleaded for the remains to be returned for proper burial.\n\n\u201cEven though a month has passed since Jamal\u2019s murder, his body has still not been given to his loved ones,\u201d Cengiz said during a Washington memorial service for her would-be husband.

I saw you working really hard, and I love you.\u2019\u201d\n\nWambach, who is a member of the board of advisers for Oath, HuffPost\u2019s parent company, stressed the importance of letting kids fail and allowing them to learn from their mistakes, whether that\u2019s on the field or off.\n\n\u201cPart of what makes sports so beautiful and important for these children is the learning of failing \u2014 the learning of failing in the moment, the learning of failing at losing, the learning of failing around their peers, the learning of making the ultimate mistake that makes their team lose,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what we parents don\u2019t do well enough is let our kids fail, is let our kids fall down so that they can figure out how to pick themselves up.\u201d\n\nDamon Dahlen/HuffPost Soccer star Abby Wambach chats about parenting at HuffPost's How To Raise A Kid conference with editor-in-chief Lydia Polgreen.\n\nThe soccer star acknowledged that her advice to let kids learn from their mistakes goes against many parents\u2019 instincts to protect their children from pain. She encouraged moms and dads to ditch their desire for perfection and remind their kids that they\u2019re allowed to go through challenges. In the end, Wambach said, that\u2019s the key to helping kids grow up to be \u201cwise and brave and kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs soon as [kids] start experiencing humanity and hardship and pain, they think that there\u2019s something wrong with them,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s not. There\u2019s not something wrong with them. There\u2019s something wrong with the world. There\u2019s something wrong with the things that they\u2019re experiencing. They\u2019re interacting with the world. I don\u2019t think that we should be steering our children away from pain. We actually have to be pointing them into the fires of their life so that they can do it. And we do it with them over and over and over again so we can show them that they\u2019re fireproof.\u201d", "YouTube\n\nIsraeli model Bar Refaeli is facing controversy after appearing in an Israeli clothing ad that shows her removing a niqab as the question \u201cIran is here?\u201d appears on the screen, according to a HuffPost translation.\n\nThe video, titled \u201cFreedom Is Basic,\u201d is part of a campaign for the Israeli clothing company Hoodies. Refaeli is a spokeswoman and part owner of the company, according to The Jerusalem Post. In the clip, Refaeli wears a niqab \u2015 a veil worn by some Muslim women that covers most of the face, apart from the eyes. She removes the veil and begins to dance as music plays. \u201cIt\u2019s all about freedom, finally breaking the chains,\u201d the song says.\n\nRefaeli and Hoodies shared the video on their respective Instagram accounts earlier this week, but those posts have since been deleted, according to BuzzFeed.\n\nRefaeli and the company have received backlash for the ad, which people online have called \u201cignorant\u201d and \u201cracist.\u201d It appears viewers are largely taking issue with the ad\u2019s implication that removing a niqab equals freedom.\n\n\u201cThis is what creates Islamophobia,\u201d one user wrote.\n\n@BarRefaeli this is just stupid.

But for some Muslim women, the garment has become an emblem of resistance. Many Twitter users argued in response to the Hoodies ad that Muslim women should be able to wear a niqab if they want to.\n\nThis is *so* fucked up.

Lewis is suing Jones over what she calls the \u201cintentional infliction of emotional distress\u201d over the last five years.\n\nThe court filing obtained by HuffPost cites numerous instances in which Infowars attempted to mislead or outright lie to viewers about the mass killing of 20 small children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in December 2012.\n\nOne 2013 video, \u201cWhy People Think Sandy Hook is a Hoax,\u201d attempted to explain away the shooting, according to the suit. Other videos and articles cited in the lawsuit include \u201cShadow Govt Strikes Again\u201d and \u201cAdam Lanza Link To Psychotropic Drugs,\u201d referring to the shooter.\n\nThe lies, which continued for years, caused multiple Sandy Hook families to become the targets of harassment by those following the conspiracies, the lawsuit says. Father Leonard Pozner, for instance, received threatening voicemails that eventually led to the arrest of 57-year-old Lucy Richards, who was banned from accessing Infowars as part of her sentence.\n\n\u201cMr. Jones and InfoWars were well-aware of the unhinged community of\n\n\u2019Sandy Hook Investigators\u2019 they had fostered,\u201d the lawsuits says. \u201cMr. Jones knew that a large collection of Sandy Hook deniers were coordinating their harassment. Plaintiff and her family have suffered harassment and threats from this community.\u201d\n\nLewis said she came forward with her lawsuit after learning her family had also been a target of Jones.\n\n\u201cAfter learning that my family was specifically targeted in Mr. Jones\u2019 campaign of attacks, I have struggled with how best to address the profound distress he has inflicted,\u201d Lewis said in a statement provided to HuffPost. \u201cIn the end, I have decided that I must join those who are standing up against Mr. Jones and his despicable actions. I simply cannot allow the threat to my family\u2019s safety go unanswered.\u201d\n\nThose standing against Jones include Pozner and Neil Heslin, two Sandy Hook parents also suing Jones for defamation. Pozner\u2019s suit survived a dismissal attempt in August.\n\nJones is also facing a defamation lawsuit against him brought by Marcel Fontaine. Infowars incorrectly identified Fontaine as the Parkland, Florida, shooter who killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14. Bankston is representing Pozner, Heslin and Fontaine in all of those cases.\n\nSix Sandy Hook families in Connecticut have also filed a separate defamation lawsuit against Jones. In their suit, the families, along with an FBI agent who responded to the shooting that day, listed numerous videos by Jones with titles including \u201cSandy Hook Shooting Exposed As A Fraud.\u201d\n\nFinally, Jones is facing a defamation lawsuit from Brennan Gilmore, who recorded the violent vehicular attack that killed 32-year-old Heather Heyer during last year\u2019s \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

It\u2019s through failure that we grow and learn. I know that\u2019s been true for me, and I think it is for everybody.\u201d\n\nKelly sparked a media firestorm last year with an uncomfortable interview with Fonda. At the time, the host directed the conversation away from Fonda\u2019s movie, \u201cOur Souls At Night,\u201d and began asking questions about plastic surgery.\n\nSince then, the two have continued to trade barbs publicly. In January, Fonda told Variety she felt Kelly\u2019s poorly timed inquiry was \u201cinappropriate,\u201d and showed \u201cshe\u2019s not that good an interviewer.\u201d\n\nDays later, Kelly retorted by blasting Fonda for her anti-Vietnam War activism in the early 1970s, noting, \u201cShe has no business lecturing anyone on what qualifies as offensive.\u201d\n\nBut Fonda appeared to bear no ill will. Also in her red carpet interview, the Oscar winner cited America\u2019s political climate as a reason more women should be \u201ctelling the stories\u201d in the media industry.\n\n\u201cA lot of what\u2019s happening is against women.

Every year on Nov. 1, the country publishes the taxable income of all of its citizens.\n\nHow much money do you earn? It\u2019s a difficult question to ask and to answer. Money is something that feels intensely personal, especially as society so often drills into people the message that income is wrapped up in self-worth. Few people are open to friends, or even their family, about how much they earn.\n\nIn Finland, however, any stranger can find out. Every year on Nov. 1, dubbed \u201cNational Jealousy Day,\u201d every Finnish citizen\u2019s taxable income is revealed, searchable by anyone.\n\n\u201cThe annual orgy of financial voyeurism might raise eyebrows in other parts of the world, but it remains an important national event in Finland,\u201d says Finnish news broadcaster Yle Uutiset.\n\nFinnish journalists trawl through the data to discover the highest-paid Finns, to uncover what celebrities are paid \u2015 this year the country\u2019s most famous porn star, Anssi Viskari, reportedly earned 23,826 euros ($27,200), according to The New York Times \u2015 and to shame those who haven\u2019t been paying their fair share of taxes.\n\nFor some of those who paid the most in taxes, there is a palpable sense of pride. Among the top earners this year, and indeed for several years now, are the founders of Supercell, a Finnish game developer; Ilka Paananen and Mikko Kodisoja earned the equivalent of about $74 million and $65 million, respectively. In 2014, Paananen said, \u201cWe\u2019ve received so much help from (Finnish) society, it\u2019s our turn to pay it back.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are ways for some of the richest to minimize their taxes, and the Finnish data does not capture everything. For example, it\u2019s not broken down into individual income items and doesn\u2019t include most non-taxable income, but it is a good snapshot of income in the country of 5.5 million people.\n\nBeing able to find out people\u2019s pay can serve a broader purpose. For advocates of transparency, Finland\u2019s openness is a good thing, allowing open and clear debate about earnings and helping screen out discrimination as well as denting the reputations of those seen not to be paying their fair share.\n\nFinland has one of the lowest income inequality levels among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. However, Finland still has a gender pay gap issue, with the average woman earning 16.5 percent less than the average man (the equivalent figure is 18.5 percent in the U.S).\n\nOpenness about how much tax people pay is not just a Finnish phenomenon. Sweden and Norway also publish citizens\u2019 tax returns. In Sweden, you only have to pick up the phone to ask about someone else\u2019s financial details, although the person you are snooping on will be informed.\n\nThe policy could be seen as part of a broader push toward trust and transparency in these Nordic societies. Michael Birkj\u00e6r, an analyst at the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen, Denmark, told HuffPost that \u201ctrust (both in other people and in the system)\u201d is one of the reasons these countries are consistently ranked best in the world to live.\n\nHowever, the benefits of this transparency are not clear-cut and there is a lack of data around its impact on equality. \u201cWhether the publishing of tax lists has a positive or negative impact on the society is a controversial question,\u201d says Kristiina \u00c4im\u00e4, who specializes in tax law at the University of Helsinki. \u201cSome people think that transparency promotes democracy in the society and some think that it violates the protection of privacy.\u201d\n\nSome critics point to the \u201cjealousy\u201d element of the disclosures and argue that knowing what others earn is more likely to tie happiness to income. A University of California study from 2011 found that, overall, there was a negative outcome from employees knowing co-workers\u2019 salaries. Those earning less than the median pay reported lower job satisfaction and were more likely to want to find another role, while those earning above the median reported no effects. But there is other research that points to positive effects. A 2016 Cornell study, for example, found knowing what co-workers make can increase performance.\n\nIt seems next to impossible to imagine this kind of transparency in the U.S., where a long debate still rages over whether President Donald Trump should make his tax returns public. He has consistently refused to release his returns despite a long precedent for presidents to do so.\n\nMany public sector salaries are public. And there is movement in the corporate sector, with some U.S. companies adopting pay transparency policies \u2015 for example, Whole Foods and social analytics company SumAll. Social sharing startup Buffer has gone a step further, making salaries available to the public, as well as internally. These companies remain very much in the minority. A 2010 study by the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that 25 percent of private companies in the U.S. prohibited staff from talking about salaries. Not many organizations can go down the route of total transparency, said David Burkus, associate professor of leadership and innovation at Oral Roberts University, \u201cbut most can do a way better job communicating how salaries are determined and why an employee was given the salary he or she was given. And we know from the research literature that both of those things are motivating and engaging for employees.\u201d And it does seem there is an increasing movement for more transparency, at least at a corporate level. Thousands of Google staff across international offices staged a mass walkout Thursday. Among their demands: an end to pay inequality. Writing in The Cut, organizers said: \u201cThis must be accompanied by transparent data on the gender, race and ethnicity compensation gap, across both level and years of industry experience, accessible to all.\u201d\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page.", "hello! The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show refuses to move forward. One model has had enough.\n\nFor the past several years, I have convinced myself that it finally must be time for the annual Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show to heed calls for a more size-inclusive runway. Every year, 2018 included, I find myself disappointed \u2015 but not surprised \u2015 when it doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe annual extravaganza has evolved from its exceedingly creepy past in some ways. The brand prides itself on the fact that its models come from all over the world, and it made waves two years ago for sending models down the runway with their natural hair. But it has largely failed to expand its narrow vision of beauty, with no apparent concern for the impact on its young, female audience.\n\nAs the rest of the fashion industry has begun to widen its lens to accommodate and celebrate people of all different shapes, sizes, abilities, races and genders, Victoria\u2019s Secret still comes up short.\n\nSo veteran plus-size model Robyn Lawley is making a bold move: calling for an outright boycott of the brand\u2019s lingerie show, which airs on TV on Dec. 2.\n\nLawley, who has covered countless magazines, designs swimwear and was the first plus-size model to appear in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, teamed up with lingerie company ThirdLove to create a petition asking people not to watch the so-called \u201csexiest night on television\u201d until Victoria\u2019s Secret \u201ccommits to representing ALL women on stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to see women like myself and women I see every day in magazines, on runways and in bras all over the world,\u201d reads the petition, which had more than 7,000 signatures as of Friday morning. \u201cSo let\u2019s start changing things from the top!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s rare to see a model take a stand against a specific brand, especially one with as much recognizability as Victoria\u2019s Secret. It\u2019s not just about damaging a relationship with that brand, but with the many people in the industry whose influence stretches far beyond this one event.\n\n\u201cGoing against a company of this size is stature is incredibly daunting,\u201d Lawley told HuffPost. \u201cThey have very big casting directors, who cast for more than just Victoria\u2019s Secret, casting these shows. That\u2019s why many models don\u2019t say anything. Our hands are kind of tied.\u201d\n\nLawley said she decided to take a stand against the lingerie company in an effort to start living a more \u201chonest\u201d life.\n\n\u201cI had a pretty traumatic incident this year, I nearly lost my life,\u201d she said, referring to a seizure and consequential 7-foot fall she experienced over the summer. \u201cI gave up trying to protect people who don\u2019t have women\u2019s interest at heart, and they don\u2019t. To glorify such an extreme body type and exclude so many types of bodies is just a joke at this stage.\u201d\n\nLawley praised Rihanna\u2019s lingerie line for its diverse runway and ThirdLove for its inclusive advertisements and sizing, and said she hopes more brands follow suit.\n\nBut in an era still obsessed with the Kardashians \u2015 who happened to all dress up as Victoria\u2019s Secret angels this year for Halloween \u2015 it\u2019s hard to figure out what would need to change for a bigger-picture shift to really happen at the company. Not even shade from Ashley Graham, arguably the most mainstream of all the curvy models at this point, got the brand to budge.\n\nAs ratings dip for the annual fashion show and more people call out Victoria\u2019s Secret for its lack of change, we might someday see a different side of the company. But for now, Lawley said, the best approach is avoidance.\n\n\u201cThat is going to be the biggest indicator to them that they\u2019ve lost their market,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s dictated that these are the most beautiful women in the world, but in my opinion beauty comes in all shapes and sizes. If they\u2019re only including one size bracket they\u2019re not including all of the most beautiful women.\u201d\n\nLawley was quick to point out that she is not denying that the women in the show are beautiful and hardworking. \u201cI\u2019m just asking where the problem is in using a few more sizes,\u201d she said.\n\nThe petition includes a call for women to share photos of themselves using the hashtag #weareallangels.

Akbar in New Delhi on June 25. In a Nov. 1 Washington Post op-ed, NPR's chief business editor, Pallavi Gogoi, accused him of sexual harassment, physical assault and rape when she worked for him more than two decades ago.\n\nThe chief business editor at NPR, Pallavi Gogoi, accused former Indian politician M.J. Akbar of sexual harassment, physical assault and rape in an op-ed published Thursday for The Washington Post.\n\nGogoi, who was born in Shillong in northeastern India and now resides in the U.S., wrote that Akbar sexually harassed and later raped her when she worked at The Asian Age over two decades ago when Akbar was the paper\u2019s editor in chief. At the time of the alleged rape, Gogoi was 23 years old and Akbar was in his 40s.\n\n\u201cThe M.J. Akbar I knew \u2015 editor in chief of the Asian Age newspaper \u2015 was a brilliant journalist,\u201d she began her essay. \u201cHe also used his position to prey on me.\u201d\n\nAkbar is a highly successful Indian journalist and author who has worked in politics and held office intermittently since 1989. He launched three Indian publications: Sunday magazine, The Telegraph and The Asian Age. In 2016 he became the minister of state for external affairs but was forced to resign last month amid multiple allegations of sexual harassment and assault.\n\nIn her essay, she wrote that Akbar, her editor in chief at the time, raped her in a hotel room in Jaipur around 1994 after he summoned her to his room to look over her work.\n\n\u201cIn his hotel room, even though I fought him, he was physically more powerful. He ripped off my clothes and raped me. Instead of reporting him to the police, I was filled with shame,\u201d Gogoi wrote.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone about this then. Would anyone have believed me? I blamed myself. Why did I go to the hotel room?\u201d she continued. \u201cWhat was worse was that after that first time, his grip over me got tighter. I stopped fighting his advances because I felt so helpless. He continued to coerce me. For a few months, he continued to defile me sexually, verbally, emotionally.\u201d\n\nGogoi wrote that Akbar routinely used his esteem and recognition to wield power over young reporters during her time at The Asian Age. She added that Akbar physically assaulted her twice before he raped her. After both incidents, Gogoi wrote that \u201cAkbar was livid\u201d and threatened to fire her if she did not give in to his demands.\n\nAkbar categorically denied Gogoi\u2019s accusations in a statement to The Times of India, writing that he and Gogoi were in a \u201cconsensual relationship that spanned several months.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Pallavi\u2019s reasons for telling this lie, but a lie it is,\u201d his wife, Mallika Akbar, said in a statement.\n\nGogoi wrote that she was inspired to come forward with her story after several Indian journalists publicly accused M.J. Akbar of sexual harassment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always felt that Akbar is above the law and justice doesn\u2019t apply to him. I felt he would never pay the price for what he had done to me,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cI am writing this because I know what it is like to be victimized by powerful men like Akbar,\u201d Gogoi continued. \u201cI am writing this for my teenage daughter and son. So they know to fight back when anyone victimizes them. So they know never to victimize anyone. So they know that 23 years after what happened to me, I have risen from those dark times, refusing to let them define me, and I will continue to move forward.\u201d", "A Brooklyn synagogue canceled a speaking event Thursday night after \u201cKill all Jews\u201d and other anti-Semitic vandalism was found written in a stairwell.\n\nIlana Glazer of the Comedy Central show \u201cBroad City\u201d was set to interview New York state Senate candidates Andrew Gounardes and Jim Gaughran at the Union Temple in Prospect Heights as part of a \u201cget out the vote\u201d campaign.\n\nBut graffiti covering parts of the building in black marker caused Glazer to cancel the event, according to ABC 7.

It\u2019s the second batch of penalties that the administration has reimposed since President Donald Trump withdrew from the landmark deal in May.\n\nWith limited exceptions, the sanctions will penalize countries that don\u2019t stop importing Iranian oil and foreign companies that do business with blacklisted Iranian entities, including Iran\u2019s central bank, a number of private financial institutions and state-run port and shipping companies.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the sanctions are \u201caimed at fundamentally altering the behavior of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u201d He has released a list of 12 demands that Iran must meet if it wants the sanctions lifted. They include ending support for terrorism, ending military engagement in Syria and completely halting its nuclear and ballistic missile development.\n\n\u201cMaximum pressure means maximum pressure,\u201d he said.\n\nPompeo said eight nations, which other officials identified as U.S. allies such as Italy, India, Japan and South Korea, will receive temporary waivers allowing them to continue to import Iranian petroleum products for a limited period as long as they end such imports entirely. He said those countries had made efforts to eliminate their imports but could not complete the task by Monday\u2019s deadline.\n\nTreasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin said 700 more Iranian companies and people would be added to the sanctions lists under the reimposed sanctions.\n\nIran hard-liners in Congress and elsewhere probably will be disappointed in the sanctions because they were pushing for no oil import waivers as well as the complete disconnection of Iran from the main international financial messaging network known as SWIFT.\n\nMnuchin defended the move to allow some Iranian banks to remain connected to SWIFT, saying that the Belgium-based firm had been warned that it will face penalties if sanctioned institutions are permitted to use it.", "The ladies of Twitter never fail to brighten our days with their brilliant \u2015 but succinct \u2015 wisdom.

They also have big gaps in benefits. In short, there\u2019s a reason this new option costs so much less.\n\nIf you decide to get one of these policies instead of a more comprehensive plan, and if an insurer will sell one to you, you really could save a lot of money on premiums. But later on, if you get sick or injured, you might end up owing a lot more in medical bills. Or you might simply have no way to get the care you need.\n\nHere\u2019s a guide to what has changed and what it could mean for you.\n\nShort-Term Plans Have Become A Long-Term Option\n\nThe big development this year is the new availability of \u201cshort term, limited duration\u201d health plans. These sorts of policies have been around for a long time, and historically they served as a stopgap for people whose coverage had temporarily lapsed \u2015 say, because they were between jobs.\n\nStarting this year, it\u2019s easier to hold on to these plans for an extended time, so that they can serve as your main source of coverage.\n\nTwo big policy changes have made this possible. One is the 2017 Republican tax cut law, which eliminated the financial penalty for people who don\u2019t have comprehensive coverage that lives up to the standards of the Affordable Care Act. The other change is a new Trump administration regulation that allows insurers to sell these plans for up to three years, minus a few days.\n\nYes, it\u2019s weird that you could use a \u201cshort-term\u201d policy for what is really the long term. In fact, some consumer groups have asked a federal judge to block the new rules, making more or less that argument.\n\nBut for now, anyway, the short-term plans are available for longer periods, just as the Trump administration had hoped they would be. And premiums for these plans may be a lot lower than the ones you will see if you go looking for traditional, comprehensive coverage at HealthCare.gov or one of the state-run insurance exchanges, such as Covered California or the Maryland Health Exchange.\n\nOverall, premiums for short-term plans are 54 percent lower than they are for comprehensive policies, according to a new study from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nTo be clear, whether you as an individual buyer would end up paying lower premiums for one of these plans depends on a bunch of factors, not least among them your household size and income.\n\nIf your income is at or just above the poverty line \u2015 specifically, up to about $35,000 annually for a family of four \u2015 then you may qualify for Medicaid, depending on whether your state has opted into the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of the program. And Medicaid is basically free.\n\nIf your income is above that threshold but still less than four times the poverty line \u2015 about $100,000 for a family of four \u2015 then you are eligible for federal tax credits that the Affordable Care Act made available and that can discount premiums deeply.\n\nIn fact, if you qualify for those tax credits but your income is still relatively low, and if you live in certain parts of the country, you might be able to get relatively generous plans while paying nothing in monthly premiums.\n\nBut if your income is higher than that, premiums for so-called Obamacare policies may cost more \u2015 a lot more.\n\nYou might even be one of those people for whom a family policy would cost more than $20,000 a year, and that\u2019s not including the deductible that, worst-case scenario, could be $14,700.\n\nEspecially if your income is above the threshold for assistance by only a small amount, you may be struggling to pay those premiums. You might even have given up and decided to remain uninsured altogether. A short-term plan might be within your budget.\n\nBut if that is what you are thinking, you should be aware of what you would be getting for your money \u2015 and, more important, what you would not be getting for your money.\n\nShort-Term Plans Can Have Big Gaps In Coverage\n\nIf you already have a medical problem, chances are good that insurers won\u2019t sell you a short-term policy at all. And if they do, they can charge you more, refuse to cover anything associated with your pre-existing condition, or both.\n\nThe list of conditions that might trigger denials, surcharges and restrictions is long, including everything from cancer to diabetes, from Crohn\u2019s disease to sleep apnea. And it\u2019s not just the obvious stuff. An old sports injury from years ago can be enough to get an insurer to exclude related conditions or deny coverage altogether.\n\nBut even if you can get one of these short-term policies without surcharges or restrictions, you might develop a medical problem after purchase. You could get a cancer diagnosis. Or have a car accident.\n\nIf that happens and you have one of these policies, you could discover that the policy doesn\u2019t cover everything you need \u2015 and that you won\u2019t have a way to get a new, more comprehensive policy for weeks or months.\n\nThere are a few reasons for that. One is that insurers who sell short-term plans frequently engage in what\u2019s known as \u201cpost-claim underwriting.\u201d They will look through your medical records and if they find anything that looks like a hint of the medical problem to come, they\u2019ll refuse to pay on grounds that it was actually a pre-existing condition.\n\nAnother issue is that short-term plans don\u2019t have to include each of the 10 benefit categories that the Affordable Care Act deems \u201cessential.\u201d They frequently leave out not just mental health and maternity coverage, but also full prescription coverage. They also have annual or lifetime limits on benefits, which is something the Affordable Care Act prohibits.\n\nAnd then there is the problem of renewability.\n\nOne of the big new changes that the Trump administration put in place was allowing insurers to sell policies that basically last up to a year, with a possibility of renewing them twice. In other words, somebody could hold on to the same short-term plan for three years \u2015 and then, quite possibly, replace it with a new, mostly similar policy when the three years is over.\n\nBut the discretion for renewability lies with the insurer, which means that, under the new rules, insurers don\u2019t have to renew once you\u2019ve gotten sick. If that happens, and if your short-term plan lapsed in the middle of the year, you wouldn\u2019t be able to pick up a comprehensive Obamacare policy \u2015 the kind available to anybody, regardless of pre-existing condition \u2015 until late in the year when enrollment reopens. (That\u2019s because loss of a short-term insurance plan does not qualify as a \u201cqualifying life event,\u201d like a divorce or loss of job, that entitles somebody to enroll in an Affordable Care Act plan even outside open enrollment.)\n\nIn any of these scenarios, if you bought a short-term policy and got seriously injured or ill, you could be on the hook for tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills.\n\nAll of this helps explain why the plans are as cheap as they are. The insurers who sell them frequently avoid paying the biggest medical bills because they don\u2019t have to cover those treatments and they don\u2019t have to enroll the people who need them.\n\nThe Details Matter, And They\u2019re Not Easy To Understand\n\nFiguring out the limits on insurance policies is complicated, even for experts. It\u2019s easy to misinterpret what you hear or read from sales agents, insurers and websites, especially if the person or company trying to sign you up for a policy is more interested in making the sale then in informing you about the limits of coverage.\n\nWhen the Trump administration proposed the rules and, later, when it finalized them, consumer advocates and public officials warned that consumers would be vulnerable to unscrupulous sellers, in part because many buyers are likely to assume that any policy available nowadays is subject to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rules.\n\nThat is why it\u2019s so important to read the fine print and, if necessary, find somebody with expertise to decipher it. Some short-term policies from UnitedHealth help pay for prescription drugs, for example, but they have a maximum benefit of $3,000. That\u2019s a pretty big deal when medications for even some relatively routine medical conditions cost hundreds of dollars for each prescription, even with discounts that the plans provide.\n\nChecking the coverage details is especially important because some of the policies on the market these days offer even thinner coverage than many short-term plans will. There are, for example, \u201cindemnity\u201d plans, which pay fixed amounts per visit or episode of care.\n\nIndemnity plans frequently advertise that they have no physician or hospital networks, which can make them sound great. But they leave subscribers on the hook for the difference between what the policies pay and what the providers charge \u2015 and that difference can quickly get into the tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nYou might still decide on a short-term plan or some other alternative to comprehensive coverage, especially if you feel like you can\u2019t afford the plans at HealthCare.gov.

Any tourist found traveling to Palau will have the products confiscated, and shops will be banned from selling them or face fines up to $1,000 per violation, according to the Associated Press.\n\nReef-safe sunscreen will still be available.\n\nSome scientists have linked the chemicals in sunscreen to poor health in corals, noting that even limited exposure can be toxic.

I also know, both from personal experience and from our people\u2019s history, that Native women make resilient and natural leaders. The 55 candidates on the ballot next week join a long list of influential Native women, including leaders like Wilma Mankiller, Elouise Cobell, Madonna Thunder Hawk, Debra White Plume and Winona LaDuke.\n\nNative women have always led; indigenous nations throughout the Americas were founded on matriarchy. Visit any tribal community and you see Native women in the trenches, directing programs and acting as the impetus for movements behind the scenes. But U.S. history, as told through the lens of colonial patriarchy, would have you believe that Native women were invisible (with the exception of Sacagawea and Pocahontas). That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\n\u201cNative women have been leading our communities since time immemorial,\u201d Peggy Flanagan told me over email. She\u2019s a citizen of the White Earth Nation of Ojibwe, has served in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2015 and is the Democratic candidate for Minnesota lieutenant governor alongside gubernatorial candidate Tim Walz. \u201cNow, we are bringing that leadership into the field of electoral politics by running for office.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never stopped being leaders, and we never stopped trying to make our voices heard,\u201d Deb Haaland said in an email. She\u2019s a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and the Democratic candidate for the 1st Congressional District of New Mexico. \u201cBut now, more than ever, we have been successfully overcoming barriers that have long prevented us from accessing positions of leadership in politics.\u201d\n\nWhen Native women see a problem in the community, we step up and fix it \u2015 it is a natural next step for us to run for office. Peggy Flanagan\n\nIt may feel like an aberration to see such a large number of Native women running for office today, but in truth, we were born to lead. Stories of the many Native great-grandmothers who kept our people alive and thriving for millennia in the face of white colonization have not been documented by the West, but we hold them in our hearts, and some of us still carry their names. (My own Dakota name \u2015 Cankudutawin, Red Road Woman \u2015 was first given to an ancestor who was present at the Battle of Greasy Grass, also known as Little Bighorn.)\n\n\u201cOur women have endured so much for so many generations that leadership comes naturally to us ... we have resiliency embedded deeply in our DNA,\u201d Ashley Nicole McCray told me. She\u2019s from the Oglala Lakota nation and Absentee Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma and is the first Native woman to run for the public utility commission in Oklahoma. \u201cThere is very little that can shake a Native woman\u2019s resolve or force her to stay down.\u201d\n\nNative leaders bring our people\u2019s past experiences into current roles and platforms \u2015 like renewable energy, education and health care. \u201cWe have faced immense struggles, from tribal sovereignty, an epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women, and being single mothers reliant on food stamps,\u201d Haaland told me. \u201cNative women are among our country\u2019s most marginalized, and we have been advocating for indigenous rights, women\u2019s rights, civil rights, LGBTQ rights, disability rights, and climate justice for centuries.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hold a strong sense of connection to the generations of women who came before us and deep responsibility to continue to work,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cWhen Native women see a problem in the community, we step up and fix it \u2015 it is a natural next step for us to run for office.\u201d\n\nWe never stopped being leaders, and we never stopped trying to make our voices heard. Deb Haaland\n\nThe journey to political office in the U.S. has never been easy for Native people, and certainly not for Native women. But the latest polling data for Haaland and the Walz/Flanagan ticket is promising: Haaland is currently up by as many as 10 percentage points, and Walz/Flanagan are leading their GOP opponents by nearly 9 points in the latest poll average. Polling data for McCray\u2019s race in Oklahoma isn\u2019t available.\n\n\u201cBecause I am on a path to become only the second Native woman in Oklahoma state history to be elected to a statewide office, I have faced sexism, racism and ageism,\u201d McCray told me. \u201cDespite my extensive qualifications and my experience, some have felt compelled to focus on my identity as a young Native woman or as an \u2018activist\u2019 in an effort to discredit me.\u201d\n\nFlanagan told me she\u2019s experienced more \u201cteachable moments\u201d while on the campaign trail than she can count. \u201cBeing diplomatic in those moments and picking my battles has become a skill I work to develop every day. A battle that most Native women I know fight every day.\u201d\n\nIn these challenging times, America needs politicians who can look at old problems with new eyes and offer original solutions \u2015 and historically marginalized citizens, including the 55 Native women candidates on the ballot next week, are that breath of fresh air. They\u2019ve been tested, they\u2019re qualified, and they are born leaders.\n\n\u201cI believe it is up to my generation to carry the burden on our shoulders so we may break the cycles that continue to keep us silenced and oppressed,\u201d McCray said. \u201cI truly believe if we do so, our emerging young women will then be able to fully rise to their power and deliver our people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe historic nature of this race isn\u2019t lost on me,\u201d Flanagan said. If elected, she would be one of the highest-ranking elected Native women in American history. \u201cI don\u2019t take this lightly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know how much things need to change,\u201d Haaland said. \u201cWe know where we need to go from here.\u201d", "Massachusetts already has the nation\u2019s strongest gun laws and lowest firearm death rate. But its lawmakers recently boosted the state\u2019s commitment to an emerging form of gun violence prevention, providing $10 million for programs specifically designed to stem the bloodshed in communities where shootings are most common.\n\nMoved in part by gun-related tragedies over the past year, the state legislature approved a funding bill in October that included initiatives that seek to prevent school-based gun violence.\n\nBut statewide data showed that shootings in schools were only a small part of the overall gun violence problem among young people. In fact, shootings take their largest toll among those who had dropped out of school or already graduated, state Rep. Andy Vargas (D) told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re averaging about 70 gun deaths a year for 16-to-24-year-olds, but all of those are happening in our neighborhoods,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cWe needed to ensure that the funding we put forward respected the facts, and the facts were that gun violence has been happening in our neighborhoods for a long time. If we really want to address it, we have to go into the places where it\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nBeginning next year, the $10 million will be awarded to nonprofit, community-based organizations that work with out-of-school individuals ages 17 to 24 who have been identified as high-risk.\n\nWith the new funding, Massachusetts has cemented its status as a leading state supporter of gun violence prevention and intervention programs tailored to urban communities, which bear the brunt of the 13,000 firearm homicides and 60,000 nonfatal shootings in the U.S. each year.\n\nThere\u2019s broad recognition that 70 gun deaths a year among young people in Massachusetts means that we can and should do more. Massachusetts state Rep. Andy Vargas (D)\n\nPrograms addressing this violence vary in cities across the U.S., with some dating back decades. They typically work by reaching out and providing services to small groups of individuals who are most at risk, either as victims or perpetrators of the violence, said Mike McLively, director of the Urban Gun Violence Initiative at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re learning from the data is that unlike mass shootings, where it\u2019s fairly hard to predict who that person is going to be, when it comes to day-to-day shootings it\u2019s much easier to figure out who is at highest risk of participating in that kind of violence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a very small subset of the population of a city \u2015 generally dozens or at most a few hundred people, even in a pretty large city.\u201d\n\nWhile many of the most popular policy responses to gun violence revolve around access to firearms, far fewer look at the demand side to determine why someone is picking up a gun to settle a conflict in the first place, McLively said.\n\nStrong gun laws are important, but trying to address gun violence with those policies alone is like trying to control drug use simply by banning substances without providing resources for prevention or treatment, he said\n\nThe results from programs such as those Massachusetts is financing suggest they\u2019re an effective way to reduce shootings and other violence. And through their intervention, they also save taxpayer dollars that might otherwise be needed by the health care or criminal justice systems.\n\nDespite the growing wealth of data backing this approach to gun violence prevention, Massachusetts is one of just six states that currently invests in these efforts. California, Connecticut, Illinois and New York have offered funding in the past. Earlier this year, lawmakers in Maryland set aside at least $5 million in future grants for the programs.\n\nMassachusetts has already seen particular success with its Safe and Successful Youth Initiative (SSYI), a community-based strategy that links nonprofits, mental health providers and law enforcement to provide outreach to youth in cities with elevated levels of juvenile crime.\n\nIn Lowell, Massachusetts, the SSYI program at the United Teen Equality Center (UTEC) begins by identifying proven-risk youth with the help of local police. UTEC \u201cstreetworkers\u201d then get in contact with those individuals.\n\nThe program is designed to target root causes of violence, working with those who enroll in it to improve employment and educational opportunities, obtain secure housing and access to mental and behavioral health services. UTEC even runs its own cafe, mattress recycling program and catering and food service business, all of which provide jobs to its clients.\n\nSSYI appears to be paying dividends in Lowell. Enrollees have shown significantly decreased recidivism rates. And the city has seen substantial declines in shootings, firearm-related criminal activity and gang-related crime.\n\nGeoff Foster, UTEC\u2019s organizing and policymaking director, said he\u2019s excited about the injection of new state funding, and hopes it will allow UTEC-Lowell and other SSYI sites to expand their operations.\n\n\u201cUTEC\u2019s focus on reducing violence among proven-risk young adults has shown us the true success of using a public health approach to best reduce gun violence,\u201d Foster said in a statement to HuffPost. He applauded the state\u2019s continued work \u201cto never allow youth violence to be seen as something normal.\u201d\n\nTo Vargas, the legislature\u2019s support for these community-based programs shows a willingness to focus on possible solutions that tend to receive less national media attention.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s broad recognition that 70 gun deaths a year among young people in Massachusetts means that we can and should do more,\u201d said Vargas.\n\nBoston Globe via Getty Images Students in March filled the hearing room inside the Massachusetts Statehouse in Boston to demand action on gun violence as part of a nationwide school walkout. Massachusetts lawmakers recently invested an additional $10 million in community-based violence prevention.\n\nConcerns about gun violence in schools are warranted, especially in the wake of the February mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, Vargas said. That\u2019s why he and his colleagues also allocated another $7.5 million to support mental and behavioral health services in the public school system.\n\nBut there also was a consensus among legislators that they needed to take a more multi-faceted, evidence-based approach to dealing with the gun violence problem, Vargas said.\n\n\u201cWe need to do what we can within our schools, but as with any investment of public money, we also need to ensure that we look at the data, look at the facts and see who\u2019s pulling the trigger, why they\u2019re pulling the trigger ... and whether or not we\u2019re missing them\u201d with services, he said.\n\nIf more states were to follow Massachusetts\u2019 example, they might begin to see the same sort of success in combating gun violence, said McLively, the Giffords Law Center official.", "On Nov. 6, the United States will vote in the first major election since Donald Trump was elected president. Trump is not on the ballot, and yet the stakes are incredibly high. The president is deeply unpopular, and his party, the Republicans, are at risk of losing their total control of Congress. The Democrats, meanwhile, are divided over the best way to leverage opposition to the president in order to regain a modicum of power. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.\n\nWho\u2019s up for election?\n\nThe overwhelming majority of races involve the United States\u2019 two major parties: The conservative Republican party, which is President Trump\u2019s party, and the Democratic party, which comprises a fractured group of moderates and progressives.\n\nMany governors\u2019 seats, state and local offices are on the ballot on Nov. 6. But most of the focus is on the races that will determine which of the two parties will control the two chambers of the U.S. Congress. In the House of Representatives, all 435 seats are up for election, and in the Senate, 35 out of 100 seats are up for election. Of those races, only a small proportion are truly competitive. There are enough competitive races, however, that control of one or both chambers of Congress could change hands.\n\nWho is going to win?\n\nThe Republican Party currently controls every elected branch of the national government. President Trump sits in the White House until at least 2020, and Republicans hold a majority in the House and the Senate. Republicans also hold two-thirds of state governors seats, which gives them broad influence over local politics.\n\nBut President Trump is one of the most divisive, unpopular presidents in modern times. His low approval rating, of 42 percent, gives Democrats hope that those who supported him in 2016 will skip this election or cross party lines and that Democratic voters will participate in unusually high numbers. They have reasons to be optimistic: Democratic voters have already increased their participation in the primaries, and more voters say they would support a Democrat over a Republican for Congress. And according to prediction models, Democrats currently have a 6-in-7 chance of capturing the House of Representatives and even or better-than-even odds of winning 15 contested governors\u2019 seats.\n\nRepublicans, however, have a 4-in-5 chance of remaining in control of the Senate. And House districts are drawn in such a way that Republicans have a built-in advantage over Democrats. Although the odds that Republicans retain the House are small, it\u2019s still entirely possible.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake?\n\nBecause this is the first major election since President Trump took office, it will function like a referendum on the first half of his presidency. Trump\u2019s actions on immigration, health care and taxation, as well as his insulting rhetoric toward women, Muslims, immigrants and people of color, have generated an enormous outcry. The election will test whether all of that outrage amounts to a loss of electoral support. It is also a test to see if the Democrats can return from the brink.\n\nWinning the House would allow Democrats to somewhat check the Trump administration\u2019s power. It would give them the ability to launch multiple, potentially damaging investigations into the administration and the president\u2019s family. They could subpoena evidence related to suspected ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, which allegedly tried to tilt the 2016 presidential election in Trump\u2019s favor. Or they could investigate the shadowy business practices of the president\u2019s vast branding and real estate empire, which is now overseen by his children.\n\nControl of the House would also give Democrats the ability to begin impeachment proceedings against the president. The Justice Department is already conducting a special investigation into the possibility that Russia and the Trump campaign secretly colluded to sway the presidential election. If that investigation turns up compelling evidence and Democrats have control of the House, many people expect Democrats to try to remove Trump from office.\n\nRepublicans are likely to remain in control of the Senate. That would allow them to continue to approve Trump\u2019s very conservative judicial appointments and to stymie any impeachment attempts. Republicans may also remain in control of both chambers of Congress, meaning Trump will continue to dominate the government with little opposition. Right now, the Democrats have a large enough minority to block much of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda, but there\u2019s not much they can do about Trump\u2019s vast executive powers.\n\nWhat else is going on?\n\nOpposition to President Trump has inspired an incredibly diverse group of candidates to run for office \u2014 mostly as Democrats. There appear to be more candidates than in recent elections who are Muslim, black, openly LGBTQ, or of Asian, Latino, or Native American heritage. And a record number of women of all backgrounds are seeking office, leading 2018 to be called \u201cThe Year of the Woman.\u201d\n\nBut this election is not just a battle between Democrats and Republicans. It\u2019s also a battle to reinvigorate the badly demoralized Democratic Party.\n\nAfter Democrats failed to win the presidency, House, and Senate in 2016, the party suffered deep divisions over which voters form the base of the Democratic party and have the ability to lead Democrats to victory in the future. Should they try to woo moderate voters, who may be uncomfortable with President Trump\u2019s rhetoric or parts of his agenda? Or, should they fire up progressive voters who are altogether furious with the president? Should they try to win back white voters who left the Democratic Party in 2016 to vote for Trump? Or, should they focus on boosting participation among people of color, who support Democrats in stronger numbers but vote with less frequency?", "Ji Sub Jeong/HuffPost The right to vote is one of the most fundamental civil rights, and it's endangered by Republican voter suppression tactics.\n\nIn the lead-up to this year\u2019s midterm elections, HuffPost Opinion asked writers to examine the many ways that voting \u2015 a fundamental and hard-won civil right \u2015 is imperiled in the United States.

In the last several years, politicians have become increasingly brazen in their drive to block people of color from participating in our democracy.\n\nFor proof, consider Georgia, where I serve as state director for the voting rights organization Let America Vote. Brian Kemp, the Republican secretary state who is running for governor, has purged hundreds of thousands of voters from the rolls and is now refusing to process 53,000 voter registrations, primarily from black Georgians.\n\nLocal officials, meanwhile, have been trying to limit voting periods and close polling locations \u2015 most often those serving African-American communities. In 2015, officials attempted to close nine of 10 polling places in Hancock County; in 2017, six of eight polls were threatened in Irwin County; and in 2018, officials moved to shutter seven of nine polling sites in Randolph County. In every case, they backed down only after civil rights groups spoke up and attracted national attention.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nThings may actually be worse in North Carolina, where Republicans have pursued scheme after scheme to complicate voting and excise people of color from the process. They\u2019ve engaged in blatant, egregious racial and partisan gerrymandering. They\u2019ve purged voters from the rolls and cut early voting days and times.\n\nThey enacted a voter ID law that a court struck down for targeting African Americans \u201cwith almost surgical precision.\u201d This year, they\u2019re trying to write extreme voter ID laws into the state constitution \u2015 along with attacks on gubernatorial power explicitly aimed at giving GOP lawmakers greater control over election administration.\n\nAnd while Georgia and North Carolina may be the most aggressive voting-rights offenders in the country at the moment, they\u2019re hardly the only ones.\n\nPoll closures and voter purges have been documented all across the country. Voter ID has spread widely over the last decade, followed in some states by insidious attempts to restrict access to needed identification by closing key state offices. Alabama in 2015 moved to close 31 of some 75 driver\u2019s license offices before relenting amid an outcry. This year, Texas introduced and then backed off from a similar plan.\n\nWhat\u2019s to be done? Election administration is a matter of law and policy, but the fundamental answer to ensuring the right to vote is moral.\n\nFor too long and in too many places, politicians have tried to shape the electorate to match their politics.\n\nPoliticians \u2015 and let\u2019s state it plainly; they\u2019re almost always Republicans \u2015 must stop manipulating our electoral system for their own gain. They must answer to a higher calling than their own re-election. They must hold themselves to a higher standard of civil engagement than that of the Jim Crow era.\n\nFor too long and in too many places, politicians have tried to shape the electorate to match their politics. We must commit to a more responsive, moral politics that values every voice in our democracy.\n\nSome states are doing just that: in recent years more than a dozen states have adopted automatic voter registration (AVR), a powerful shift in elections administration that registers voters or updates their information anytime they interact with state government. AVR eliminates a major barrier for would-be voters, eases administration for election officials, improves accuracy in voter databases and makes elections more secure. And experience from recent elections clearly shows it increases participation.\n\nStates could also ease restrictions on voting rights for former offenders. In Florida, Iowa and Kentucky, voters permanently lose the franchise with a felony conviction \u2015 even after they\u2019ve served their sentence, paid their fines, fees and restitution, rebuilt their lives and reintegrated into society.\n\nLaws in many other states are less stringent but have similar intentions. None of them serve society \u2015 they just piggyback on existing racial and socioeconomic disparities in criminal justice to disenfranchise millions of Americans and sideline already marginalized groups from the democratic process.\n\nThere\u2019s more. Policymakers should end voter purges and repeal ID laws. And Congress must update and upgrade the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s notorious Shelby County v. Holder decision in 2013 eviscerated the law, neutering the provision that allowed the Department of Justice to vet voting provisions in places with a history of voter suppression.\n\nIt\u2019s been a disaster. For proof, consider the report released last month by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Federal action on voting rights has cratered since the decision, the report found \u2015 including enforcement of provisions that remain in effect. Discrimination against minority voters, the head of the commission told The New York Times, is \u201denduring and pernicious.\u201d\n\nPoliticians \u2015 and let\u2019s state it plainly; they\u2019re almost always Republicans \u2015 must stop manipulating our electoral system for their own gain.\n\nCongress must move swiftly to update the Voting Rights Act and identify a new list of jurisdictions where a recent history of blatant, anti-democratic voter suppression demands federal review and approval before new measures can be adopted. Policies abound that would safeguard our electoral system and make voting more accessible for everyone, if politicians are only willing to embrace them.\n\nThe election looming before us represents a key moment that will decide whether we embrace our increasingly diverse society or retreat into division and injustice. For years, division and injustice have been on the march, and this is our chance to push it back.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement is not just history. The march from Selma to Montgomery was not the end of the struggle. And the Civil Rights Act of 1965 did not secure voting rights in perpetuity.\n\nThe work goes on, for the activists on the streets and the canvassers knocking doors today, the voters at the ballot box in November, and the lawmakers sworn into office next January.\n\nThe work goes on, in other words, for all of us.", "The idea that an extramarital affair could not only upend but swiftly topple a politician\u2019s entire career seems so obviously quaint in 2018.\n\nNevertheless, that scenario is revisited in \u201cThe Front Runner,\u201d writer-director Jason Reitman\u2019s film on the ill-fated campaign of 1988 Democratic presidential front-runner Gary Hart (played by Hugh Jackman), opening Tuesday.\n\nBased on Yahoo! News columnist Matt Bai\u2019s 2014 book, the movie recounts how the married Hart\u2019s affair with a young woman, Donna Rice, became the overwhelming focus of campaign coverage at the time, marking \u2015 according to Bai \u2015 a converging point for political journalism and tabloid fodder.\n\nHart\u2019s downfall, we\u2019re meant to believe, is a push-pin worthy moment on the timeline of \u201cHow the hell did we get here?\u201d Here being whatever political funhouse surrounds us now. In our case: Donald Trump\u2019s America, where affairs and personal scandals often dominate news coverage of him but nary affect the man\u2019s clutch on power.\n\n\u201cThe Front Runner\u201d kicks off in the spring of 1987, when the then-Colorado senator was leading in early presidential polls as an above-the-fray candidate focused on \u201ca campaign of ideas.\u201d Frenzied shots and cuts mirror the frenetic pace of the race and establish the movie\u2019s varying points of view: Hart, his family, his campaign staff and the reporters following every twist and turn.\n\nThe film picks up momentum when tabloid photographers catch Hart on a yacht with Miami actress and model Rice (Sara Paxton). The two begin an affair, only to soon find themselves dogged by a team of Miami Herald reporters. The journalists received an anonymous tip that led them to confront Hart in an alleyway adjacent to his Washington home, where Rice was visiting for the weekend.\n\nThe story of the affair breaks, sending the campaign into free fall. Spoiler alert: Hart eventually backs out of the race.\n\nSony Pictures Hugh Jackman as an embattled Gary Hart besieged by the media in \"The Front Runner.\"\n\n\u201cThe Front Runner\u201d is not a biopic. Instead, the film focuses on the weeks between the scandal going public and Hart\u2019s withdrawal from the race, following the various people in the senator\u2019s orbit \u2015 mostly his campaign staff, led by Reitman regular J.K. Simmons as campaign manager Bill Dixon, who is trying to stem the fallout from Hart\u2019s affair and head off the Miami Herald and Washington Post reporters chasing the story.\n\nAfter a screening of the movie in Washington, Reitman and the movie\u2019s co-writers Bai and Jay Carson spoke about the push and pull between the campaign and the media depicted in their film, which they say never quite lands on one side or the other. The filmmakers claim they aren\u2019t rooting for anyone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a movie without good guys or bad guys \u2014 as you would say, no white hats or black hats,\u201d Reitman said. \u201cJust people trying to do their jobs and trying to do the right thing, as the world suddenly gets very confusing.\u201d\n\nHowever, Reitman\u2019s film ultimately does take a sympathetic view of Hart, portraying him as the victim of a frenzied media. He and his campaign staff decry contemporary political coverage as \u201ctabloid bullshit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re going to write should never be written,\u201d Jackman-as-Hart warns his wife, Lee (Vera Farmiga), the night before the scandal goes public.\n\nOnce the campaign unravels, the still idealistic Hart clashes with the more pragmatic Dixon. The former remains reluctant to address the growing scandal, which he sees as a personal issue irrelevant to his presidential bid, but the latter realizes the genie is out of the bottle, and there\u2019s no turning back.\n\n\u201cI care about the sanctity of this process, whether you do or do not!\u201d Hart says, his voice thundering, a scene that feels out of place against Jackman\u2019s otherwise restrained performance.\n\nAs the movie on the whole devolves into a polemic, at times squarely an indictment of the media, \u201cThe Front Runner\u201d brings to mind two other films that predate the Hart scandal and tread on similar territory with much more concision: 1972\u2032s \u201cThe Candidate,\u201d featuring Robert Redford as an idealistic political neophyte jaded by a system favoring soundbites over policy discussions (which Reitman cited as a \u201cNorth Star\u201d for his movie), and \u201cBroadcast News.\u201d\n\nThe characters in \u201cBroadcast News\u201d \u2015 released in 1987, a few months after Hart\u2019s downfall \u2015 wrestle with the trend toward prioritizing style over substance. Early in the movie, brilliant workaholic producer Jane Craig (Holly Hunter) is addressing a conference of broadcast journalists, warning them of the growing influence of entertainment coverage on TV news practices. On one recent occasion, she explains, every major news network aired a clip of euphoric children at an international dominoes competition, instead of covering that day\u2019s major international policy issue.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s good film. I know it\u2019s fun. I like fun. It\u2019s just not news,\u201d she tells the attendees. Only proving her point, she has completely lost her audience. By the end of her spiel, their eyes are glued to the clip of cascading dominoes behind her.\n\nLater on, her best friend/co-worker/will-they-won\u2019t-they love interest Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) confronts Jane about her budding relationship with another colleague, Tom Grunik (William Hurt). Aaron and Tom embody the two sides of her debate. Aaron is a meticulous, gifted reporter; Tom is a charismatic presence on camera who self-admittedly doesn\u2019t understand the news that he\u2019s reading. Tom, Aaron argues, is a threat to the work of serious journalists \u2015 a harbinger of journalism\u2019s descent into mediocrity and vanity.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll just, bit by little bit, lower our standards where they\u2019re important,\u201d Aaron tells Jane. \u201cJust a tiny little bit. Just coax along, flash over substance. Just a tiny little bit. And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Front Runner\u201d is no \u201cBroadcast News.\u201d It fails in its intention to reveal the bigger picture behind Hart\u2019s downfall, to connect his past with our present. Its characters stand in for moral arguments rather than effectively act them out. Leaving the theater, you\u2019re no closer to answering the question of \u201cHow the hell did we get here?\u201d than you were when you entered.\n\nBut Reitman\u2019s bird\u2019s-eye-view technique hints at what could have been. Some of the film\u2019s best and most trenchant moments, particularly involving the women in the story, open up threads about the ideas of victimhood and how men control our political narratives.\n\nThe film confidently explores how Rice was reduced to a punchline, like so many women at the center of political scandals who are given no agency, their identities all but erased. When Rice\u2019s identity becomes synonymous with the scandal, when she is written off by the public as a dumb slut and forced into hiding, the film makes clear that, unlike Hart, she has no entourage of handlers to protect her. One female staffer tasked with looking after Rice, a composite character named Irene Kelly (Molly Ephraim), becomes disillusioned with the campaign as a result.\n\n\u201cThis is never going to be over for her, every time she applies for a job,\u201d Kelly says of Rice.\n\nA more compelling movie could have been built more around the characters of Rice and Kelly, or Washington Post editor Ann Devroy (Ari Graynor). In Reitman\u2019s story, Devroy\u2019s male colleague (Mamoudou Athie as reporter A.J. Parker, another composite character) questions whether the outlet is sensationalizing a politician\u2019s personal life for the sake of selling papers. Devroy argues against him, claiming that the story matters.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man with power and opportunity, and that takes a certain responsibility,\u201d she says of Hart, a reminder that\u2019s far from quaint in our Me Too era.\n\nLike its characters\u2019 blow-out hair and brick-sized cell phones, the movie at large plays out like a relic of times past. Yet its Election Day release date suggests that the studio believes the story upon which \u201cThe Front Runner\u201d is based is timely, and the team behind the movie seems to think that too.\n\n\u201cThe system has changed a lot,\u201d Carson conceded, but \u201cit\u2019s not necessarily that this [story] is quaint. We\u2019re just in a moment where we watched the beginning of the change.\u201d", "Barbra Streisand should have told James Corden about her failed driving tests before picking him up for the latest installment of \u201cCarpool Karaoke.\u201d\n\nIn a twist on the usual proceedings, \u201cThe Late Late Show\u201d host actually rode shotgun with the famed singer/actress/director in the comedy bit that aired Thursday night.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Streisand revealed how she doesn\u2019t drive much, and once accidentally drove onto the up ramp of a highway.\n\n\u201cThis is not what I need to hear right now,\u201d said Corden. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be honest though, if this is how I go out, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\nIn between belting out her classic songs, Streisand also revealed how she dealt with stage fright, discussed the time she called Apple CEO Tim Cook to change how Siri said her name and explained why her new album \u201cWalls\u201d was a pointed dig at President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.", "ASSOCIATED PRESS A fire devastated an electronic appliances market in Kabul, Afghanistan on Friday,\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan (AP) \u2014 Residents of the Afghan capital grappled on Friday with the aftermath of a massive fire that destroyed hundreds of stores overnight at a market in central Kabul, incinerating businesses and leaving an apocalyptic scene of disaster in its wake.\n\nNo casualties were reported but the loss was estimated in the millions of dollars.\n\nFirefighters were still struggling, pouring water over smoldering flames in daylight Friday, more than 13 hours after the blaze started at the city\u2019s largest market for electronic goods and home appliances.\n\nOne of the merchants, Hejratullah Khan, sifted through the charred ruins of one of his three mobile phone stores that the fire had destroyed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing left .... in one night, everything is gone, everything,\u201d Khan as he recounted how it took him 10 years to build up his business.\n\nHis Dunya Mobile stores were a fixture in Kabul. \u201cWe were the largest mobile phone shops,\u201d he said as he rummaged through the stacks of mobile phones melted into black twisted blobs of metal\n\nKhan\u2019s life savings and those of his two brothers were gone.

He said the administration is \u201creviewing putting sanctions on the individuals that we have been able to identify to date that ... were engaged in that murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll take us probably a handful more weeks before we have enough evidence to actually put those sanctions in place, but I think we\u2019ll be able to get there,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to find the fact pattern,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president said we will demand accountability for those who were involved in the commission of this heinous crime.\u201d\n\nWhile insisting the United States did not condone Khashoggi\u2019s killing, the top U.S. diplomat said the United States had \u201cdeep and long-term strategic relationships\u201d with Saudi Arabia and \u201cwe intend to make sure that those relationships remain intact.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s former intelligence minister, Prince Turki bin Faisal al Saud, said on Wednesday that the outcry in the United States demonizing Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi\u2019s killing threatened to disrupt strategic ties between the two countries.\n\n\u201cWe value our strategic relationship with the United States and hope to sustain it.

According to a report by Elle.com, former NFL cheerleaders said that the act of protesting would distract from a cheerleader\u2019s job to be a positive and upbeat presence on the field \u2015 which likely deters many cheerleaders from participating, despite their political beliefs.\n\n\u201cBottom line, cheerleaders are a little fish in a big pond,\u201d broadcast journalist and former Jacksonville Jaguars cheerleader Michele Wright told Elle. \u201cAlthough they are of great worth and value to the football experience and their respective communities, many are undervalued. So to remain neutral, they wouldn\u2019t take a knee.\u201d\n\nTrump has railed against all forms of protest during the national anthem since its inception in 2016. When it was clear the demonstrations would continue during the 2018 NFL pre-season, Trump urged the league to suspend the protesting athletes without pay.\n\nThe NFL players are at it again - taking a knee when they should be standing proudly for the National Anthem.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 10, 2018\n\nThe NFL attempted to stop the kneeling protests in May by approving a mandate that requires players on the field to stand during the national anthem while giving them the option to remain off the field.\n\nThe league put a hold on the ban in July after the players\u2019 union complained it was \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the NFL\u2019s collective bargaining agreement and violated the players\u2019 rights.\n\nHowever, the ban didn\u2019t stop players from protesting during the anthem in new ways, including raising a fist and continuing to take a knee.", "TONIGHT: Halloween is over but Trump is still trying to frighten America with lies about the caravan. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/QxKL5uldQf\n\nTrump claimed Thursday that those who are applying for asylum \u2015 which is legal under U.S. law \u2015 are simply reading a script they\u2019ve been given.\n\n\u201cThey never heard of the phrase before,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe in the phrase, but they\u2019re given a little legal statement to read and they read it, and now all of a sudden they\u2019re supposed to qualify.\u201d\n\nColbert suggested applying that standard across the board... then used a clip of Trump from just last year to make the case that the president should be deported.", "An incendiary video tweeted Thursday by President Donald Trump not only shockingly compared members of a migrant caravan heading to the U.S. to an immigrant cop-killer, it also falsely held the Democrats solely responsible for his presence in America.\n\nLuis Bracamontes, now on death row at San Quentin for killing a California sheriff\u2019s deputy and detective in 2014, is featured in the fearmongering video that critics are comparing to the notoriously racist \u201cWille Horton\u201d ad attacking Michael Dukakis during his Democratic run for the presidency in 1988.\n\nThe new video blames Democrats for letting Bracamontes into the U.S. and allowing the undocumented immigrant to stay in the country. \u201cWho else would the Democrats let in?\u201d the video asks.\n\nBut Bracamontes was first deported during the Clinton administration and later slipped back into the U.S. during the George W.

Trump and Republicans have opposed making the gun illegal. It was most recently used by the gunman who killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue last week.\n\nBracamontes initially entered the country illegally in 1993 and was deported in 1997 following a drug sentence.

Trump and GOP nominee Ron DeSantis spent much of their Wednesday night rally in Fort Myers attacking Gillum and warning their supporters that he was a \u201cradical socialist\u201d who would, if elected, turn Florida into Venezuela.\n\nAnd DeSantis used his strongest language yet regarding an ongoing FBI probe into a lobbyist and longtime friend of Gillum and his dealings with the Tallahassee city government. In an exurban hockey arena across the state in deeply Republican Fort Myers, DeSantis said that while Gillum believes Trump should be impeached, Gillum had \u201caccepted bribes\u201d from an undercover FBI agent.\n\n\u201cMaybe we should impeach him!\u201d DeSantis said, to which the crowd of 8,000 chanted, \u201cLock him up! Lock him up!\u201d\n\nThere is no indication that Gillum is under investigation, and he has said the FBI told him he is not a target of the probe.\n\nHe did not address the charges in his remarks Thursday afternoon. He spent much of his time on the stage, set up in a parking lot across from North Miami High School, running through the highlights of his stump speech, including a promise to raise teacher pay and expand health care coverage.\n\nHe told his supporters that the best way to respond to Trump and DeSantis is to vote against them in early voting or on Election Day. \u201cWe have an opportunity on Nov. 6 to send a message to Donald Trump and to Ron DeSantis, to let them know that their politics have reached their limit,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we vote, we win.\u201d\n\nThat message was falling on receptive ears, in a poor community that has become a center for Haitian immigrants in recent decades.\n\n\u201cAndrew Gillum\u2019s the guy,\u201d said Pierre Charles, who teaches algebra to high school and community college students.

Claire McCaskill addressed the Democratic National Convention in Denver and declared, \u201cWhat unites us as Americans is a belief in a common dream \u2015 that in America, anyone can accomplish anything.\u201d\n\nThis week, she issued a clarification: Anyone does not include people who were born in other countries.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, McCaskill heaped praise on President Donald Trump and his immigration agenda. For weeks now, the president has been spouting anti-immigrant venom laced with nods to anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and policy ideas cribbed from white nationalists. McCaskill wanted Fox viewers to know she thinks there are some good ideas in there.\n\n\u201cStop them at the border,\u201d McCaskill said, referring to a so-called \u201ccaravan\u201d of migrants making its way to the United States from Central America. \u201cI \u2015 100 \u2015 percent back him up on that,\u201d arguing that \u201cturning them back\u201d was necessary \u201cbecause we are not equipped to handle that many asylum claims.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not want our borders overrun. And I support the president\u2019s efforts to make sure they\u2019re not,\u201d McCaskill said, urging Trump to use \u201cevery tool he has at his disposal.\u201d\n\nMcCaskill\u2019s Fox interview ran the day Trump announced he planned to end birthright citizenship through executive order, and one day after the president declared that more than 5,000 American soldiers were being dispatched to the border to confront people \u2015 roughly one-third of whom are children \u2015 still hundreds of miles away.\n\nIf vulnerable Democrats decide the best way to deal with Trump\u2019s increasingly vicious rhetoric is to adopt some of it themselves, the focus of legitimate public debate shifts ever-Trumpward.\n\nEverybody in Democratic Party officialdom surely knows this is disgraceful, which may be why they refuse to answer questions about it. HuffPost reached out to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. None would comment on McCaskill\u2019s recent rhetoric. A spokeswoman for McCaskill clarified that she does not believe the president has the authority to end birthright citizenship through executive order, saying she still supports legal status for Dreamers, and wants to focus on \u201ccommonsense, bipartisan ideas.\u201d\n\nBut whatever the specifics of her policy agenda, there\u2019s no question that McCaskill is trying to yoke herself to Trump on immigration in the public imagination right before the midterm elections. In doing so, she\u2019s lending the legitimacy of a Democratic Senator to an agenda of undisguised hate. The fact that Schumer and other party leaders can\u2019t bring themselves to utter a word of criticism for this performance is nearly as disgraceful as the performance itself.\n\nNor is McCaskill the only Democrat hopping on Trump\u2019s immigrant-bashing bandwagon. Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) has been touting his support for a border wall in campaign stops across Indiana. In a Wednesday debate, Donnelly suggested he was open to revoking birthright citizenship through legislation.\n\nAll of this is dangerous. If vulnerable Democrats decide the best way to deal with Trump\u2019s increasingly vicious rhetoric is to adopt some of it themselves, the focus of legitimate public debate shifts ever-Trumpward. The government is already sending thousands of troops to the border in a militarized stunt. Nobody wants to think about what escalation looks like.\n\nThis spring, McCaskill and Donnelly were among a dozen Democrats to support a bank deregulation bill, siding with Trump over the objections of organized labor, consumer advocacy groups and civil rights organizations. In her Fox interview, McCaskill touted her support for the bill to distinguish herself from more liberal colleagues. \u201cElizabeth Warren sure went after me when I advocated tooling back some of the regulations for small banks and credit unions.\u201d\n\nMcCaskill did not emphasize other aspects of that bill, which rolled back regulations on foreign megabanks including Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and Barclays, and helped smaller banks hide racial discrimination in the mortgage market. For an older generation of Democratic strategists, this type of corporate favoritism is considered an unfortunate but necessary price of politics. Selling out to big business helps lawmakers raise money to run for re-election and frees them up to defend the real priorities.\n\nBut what exactly are the real priorities for Democrats like Donnelly and McCaskill? What\u2019s the point of raising all that money from the banking industry if you\u2019re going to spend it feeding anti-immigrant paranoia?\n\nBoth McCaskill and Donnelly are locked in very close re-election contests. If Democrats have a good night on Tuesday, both could survive difficult challenges. If not, both could end up in a new phase of their careers. And it\u2019s hard to predict how their recent immigrant-bashing will play. Trump won both Indiana and Missouri by a wide margin, but Obama won Indiana in 2008. Maybe emulating Trump on immigration will help Democrats with some white voters. Maybe it will backfire and reduce turnout among voters of color.", "Two more corporate donors confirmed Thursday they would no longer support Congressman Steve King over the Iowa Republican\u2019s support of white nationalism and his ties to far-right groups abroad.\n\nPork producer Smithfield Foods Inc. and utilities provider Black Hills Energy joined the growing list of businesses that are ceasing their funding for King, both companies told HuffPost on Thursday.\n\n\u201cBlack Hills Energy\u2019s political action committee has contributed to Rep. Steve King\u2019s campaign, but will no longer do so because of recent statements which conflict with our company values,\u201d said a spokesperson for Black Hills Energy.\n\nSmithfield Foods\u2019 and Black Hills Energy\u2019s decisions follow announcements by several large corporations, including Intel, Purina and Land O\u2019 Lakes, they they have also withdrawn their backing. Most of the political action committees and corporations that have dropped their support also contributed relatively little sums of money to King\u2019s campaign compared with larger donors.\n\nKing, an eight-term congressman who has easily defended his seat in the past despite his extreme anti-Islam, anti-immigrant rhetoric and ties to the international far-right, is facing growing public pressure over his recent visit to Austria. HuffPost reported last month that the congressman spouted white nationalist conspiracies and overtly racist ideology in a lengthy interview with far-right Austrian website Unzensuriert. King spoke with the website while on a trip funded in part by a Holocaust remembrance organization.\n\nWhile in Vienna, The Washington Post reports, he also met with representatives of Austria\u2019s Freedom Party, a far-right political party founded in the 1950s by a former Nazi SS officer. King has a long history of hateful rhetoric against immigrants and Muslims, and has expressed his support for far-right extremists.\n\nTwo of Iowa\u2019s prominent Jewish leaders condemned King this week in a letter to the Des Moines Register, and called on donors to stop funding his campaign. King is \u201can enthusiastic crusader\u201d for the same beliefs as those of the anti-Semitic attacker who killed 11 people on Saturday at a Pittsburgh synagogue, the Jewish leaders wrote.\n\nBut despite his ideology, many of King\u2019s largest donors remain supportive of his re-election campaign or have not announced plans to cease funding. Koch Industries, the American Bankers Association, the American Crystal Sugar Co., Tyson Foods Inc. and the National Beer Wholesalers Association did not return HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment on whether they were sticking with the congressman.\n\nMeanwhile, AT&T told HuffPost that it had no plans to make any additional campaign donations this year and said it would closely review future funding, but did not commit to ending its contributions entirely. Berkshire Hathaway Energy similarly distanced itself from King, but did not say it would fully drop its support.\n\n\u201cBerkshire Hathaway Energy\u2019s political action committee has not made any donations to Rep. King since 2017 and any future donations will be carefully evaluated in light of current events,\u201d said Jessica Strawn, director of corporate communications for Berkshire Hathaway Energy.\n\nKing is facing a much closer race in this campaign than in previous elections.

To receive TomDispatch in your inbox three times a week, click here.\n\nGiven his erratic behavior, from daily Twitter eruptions to upping his tally of lies by the hour, it\u2019s hard to think of Donald Trump as a man with a plan. But in at least one area \u2015 reshaping the economy to serve the needs of the military-industrial complex \u2015 he\u2019s (gasp!) a socialist in the making.\n\nHis plan is now visibly taking shape \u2015 one we can see and assess thanks to a Pentagon-led study with a distinctly tongue-twisting title: \u201cAssessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States.\u201d The analysis is the brainchild of Trump\u2019s adviser for trade and manufacturing policy, Peter Navarro, who happens to also be the key architect of the president\u2019s trade wars.\n\nNavarro, however, can hardly take sole credit for the administration\u2019s latest economic plan, since the lead agency for developing it was also the most interested of all in the project, the Pentagon itself, in particular its Office of Defense Industrial Policy. In addition, those producing the report did so in coordination with an alphabet soup of other agencies from the Department of Commerce to the Director of National Intelligence. And even that\u2019s not all. It\u2019s also the product of an \u201cinteragency task force\u201d made up of 16 working groups and 300 \u201csubject matter\u201d experts, supplemented by over a dozen industry \u201clistening sessions\u201d with outfits like the National Defense Industrial Association, an advocacy organization that represents 1,600 companies in the defense sector.\n\nBefore jumping into its substance and implications for the American economy and national defense, let me pause a moment to mention two other small matters.\n\nFirst, were you aware that the Pentagon even had an Office of Defense Industrial Policy? It sounds suspiciously like the kind of government organization that engages in economic planning, a practice anathema not just to Republicans but to many Democrats as well. The only reason it\u2019s not a national scandal \u2015 complete with Fox News banner headlines about the end of the American way of life as we know it and the coming of creeping socialism \u2015 is because it\u2019s part of the one institution that has always been exempt from the dictates of the \u201cfree market\u201d: the Department of Defense.\n\nSecond, how about those 300 subject matter experts? Since when does Donald Trump consult subject matter experts? Certainly not on climate change, the most urgent issue facing humanity and one where expert opinion is remarkably unified. The Pentagon and its contractors should, however, be thought of as the ultimate special interest group and with that status comes special treatment. And if that means consulting 300 such experts to make sure their \u201cneeds\u201d are met, so be it.\n\nA Slogan for the Ages?\n\nNow for the big stuff.\n\nAccording to Peter Navarro\u2019s summary of the new industrial base report, which appeared as an op-ed in The New York Times, the key to the Trump plan is the president\u2019s belief that \u201ceconomic security equals national security.\u201d When it comes to weapons manufacturing, the administration\u2019s approach involves building a Fortress America economy that will depend as little as possible on foreign suppliers. Consider it just the latest variation on Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d economic strategy, grounded in its unapologetic embrace of nationalism. As a slogan, \u201ceconomic security equals national security\u201d doesn\u2019t have quite the populist ring of \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d but it\u2019s part of the same worldview.\n\nIn a flight of grandiosity (and flattery) that must have made his boss swell with pride, Navarro suggested in his op-ed that the slogan might go down in the annals of history alongside other famed pearls of presidential wisdom. As he put it:\n\n\u201cMcKinley\u2019s... \u2018Patriotism, protection and prosperity\u2019... catalyzed strong economic growth. Roosevelt\u2019s \u2018Speak softly and carry a big stick\u2019 helped transform the Navy into a military force capable of projecting power around the world. And Reagan\u2019s \u2018Peace through strength\u2019 inspired an unprecedented rebuilding of the military that brought the Soviet Union to its knees... History will judge whether Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018economic security is national security\u2019 joins the ranks of great presidential maxims.\u201d\n\nThe essence of the Pentagon\u2019s scheme for making America safe for a never-ending policy of war preparations (and war) is to organize as much of the economy as possible around the needs of military production. This would involve eliminating what Navarro describes as the \u201c300 vulnerabilities\u201d of the defense economy \u2015 from reliance on single suppliers for key components in weapons systems and the like, to dependence on foreign inputs like rare earth minerals from China, to a shortage of younger workers with the skills and motivation needed to keep America\u2019s massive weapons manufacturing machine up and running. China figures prominently in the report\u2019s narrative, with its trade and investment policies repeatedly described as \u201ceconomic aggression.\u201d\n\nAnd needless to say, this being the Pentagon, one of the biggest desires expressed in the report is a need for \u2015 yes, you guessed it! \u2015 more money. Never mind that the United States already spends more on its military than the next seven nations in the world combined (five of whom are U.S. allies). Never mind that the increase in Pentagon spending over the past two years is larger than the entire military budget of Russia. Never mind that, despite pulling tens of thousands of troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan, this country\u2019s spending on the Pentagon and related programs (like nuclear warhead work at the Department of Energy) will hit $716 billion in fiscal year 2019, one of the highest levels ever. Face it, say the Pentagon and its allies on Capitol Hill, the U.S. won\u2019t be able to build a reliable, all-weapons-all-the-time economic-industrial base without spending yet more taxpayer dollars. Think of this as a \u201cPentagon First\u201d strategy.\n\nAs it happens, the Pentagon chose the wrong 300 experts. The new plan, reflecting their collective wisdom, is an economic and security disaster in the making.\n\nConsider it beyond ironic that some of the same experts and organizations now suggesting that we bet America\u2019s future on pumping up the most inefficient sector of our economy \u2015 no, no, I didn\u2019t mean the coal industry, I meant the military-industrial complex \u2015 are conservative experts who criticized the Soviet Union for the very same thing. They still claim that it imploded largely because Washington cleverly lured its leaders into devoting ever more of their resources to the military sector. That, they insist, reinforced a rigidity in the Soviet system which made it virtually impossible for them to adapt to a rapidly changing global economic landscape.\n\nOur military buildup, they still fervently believe, bankrupted the Soviet Union. Other analysts, like the historian Lawrence Wittner, have questioned such a view. But for the sake of consistency, shouldn\u2019t conservatives who claimed that excessive military spending did in the Soviets be worried that President Trump\u2019s policy of massive tax cuts for the rich, increased Pentagon spending, and trade wars with adversaries and allies alike might do something similar to the United States?\n\nWhat Would a Real Industrial Policy Look Like?\n\nIndustrial policy should not be a dirty word. The problem is: the Pentagon shouldn\u2019t be in charge of it. The goal of an effective industrial policy should be to create well-paying jobs, especially in sectors that meet pressing national needs like rebuilding America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure and developing alternative energy technologies that can help address the urgent dangers posed by climate change.\n\nThe biggest economic challenge facing the United States today is how to organize an economic transition that would replace jobs and income generated by dysfunctional activities like overspending on the Pentagon and subsidizing polluting industries. The argument that the Pentagon is crucial to jobs production in America has been instrumental in blocking constructive changes that would benefit both the environment and true American security. Members of Congress are, for example, afraid to jettison questionable weapons programs like the F-35 combat aircraft \u2015 an immensely costly, underperforming fighter plane that may never be ready for combat \u2015 for fear of reducing jobs in their states or districts. (The same is true of the coal and petroleum industries, which endlessly play up the supposed job-creating benefits of their activities.)\n\nWhere could alternatives to Pentagon job-creation programs come from? The short answer is: invest in virtually anything but buying more weapons and waging more wars and Americans will be better off. For instance, Pentagon spending creates startlingly fewer jobs per dollar than putting the same taxpayer dollars into infrastructure repair and rebuilding, alternative energy creation, education, or health care. A study conducted by University of Massachusetts economist Heidi Garrett-Peltier for the Costs of War Project at Brown University found that, had the government invested in civilian activities the $230 billion per year wasted on America\u2019s post-9/11 wars, that sum would have created 1.3 million additional jobs. A more equitable tax policy that required wealthy individuals and corporations to pay their fair share could similarly fund a $2 trillion infrastructure program that would support 2.5 million new jobs in its first year, according to a proposal put forward by the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nAs for the president\u2019s much touted, dramatically overblown claims about the jobs to be had from arms exports, the global arms market represents only a tiny fraction of the growing market for renewable energy technologies. If the goal is to produce jobs via exports, developing technologies to tap the huge future market in renewables, which one study suggests could hit $2.1 trillion by 2025, would leave weapons systems in the dust. After all, that\u2019s about 20 times the current size of the total global arms trade, which clocks in at about $100 billion annually. But an analysis by Miriam Pemberton and her colleagues at the Institute for Policy Studies indicates that the United States spends 28 times as much on its military as it does on genuinely job-creating programs designed to address the threat of climate change.\n\nSuch actions would be a good start \u2015 but just a start \u2015 when it comes to reducing the dependency of the United States economy on guns and pollution. Of course, the Trump administration doesn\u2019t have the faintest interest in any of this. (It would apparently rather cede the lucrative future market in renewable energy to China, with barely a fight.)\n\nStill, the question remains: What would such a shift in priorities mean for the defense industrial base? If you accept the premise that the U.S. government needs to run a permanent war economy (and also fight never-ending wars across a significant swath of the planet), some of the Pentagon\u2019s recommendations might almost make sense. But a foreign policy that put more emphasis on diplomacy \u2015 one that also thought it important to address non-military dangers like climate change \u2015 wouldn\u2019t require such a large military production network in the first place. Under this scenario, the alarmist argument that the U.S. won\u2019t be able to defend itself without stepping up the militarization of our already exceedingly militarized economy suddenly becomes unpersuasive.\n\nBut let\u2019s give the weapons sector some credit. Its CEOs are working assiduously to build up local economies \u2015 overseas. Saudi Arabia\u2019s long-term economic plan, for instance, calls for 50% of the value of its weapons purchases to be spent building up its own military industry. U.S. weapons giants like Raytheon and Lockheed Martin have been quick to pledge allegiance to that plan, setting up subsidiaries there and agreeing to have systems like helicopters assembled in Saudi Arabia, not the United States. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is helping the United Arab Emirates develop the capability to produce robot-controlled machine tools that are in great demand in the defense and aerospace industries. And the F-35 program is creating production jobs in more than a dozen countries, including assembly plants in Italy and Japan.\n\nRaytheon CEO Thomas Kennedy summed up this approach when he discussed his company\u2019s growing partnership with Saudi Arabia: \u201cBy working together, we can help build world-class defense and cyber capabilities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u201d And keep in mind that these are the jobs from so many of those Saudi weapons sales that President Trump keeps bragging about. Of course, while this may be bad news for American jobs, it works just fine as a strategy for keeping the profits of U.S. arms makers stratospheric.", "As immigrants and their families continue to grapple with Donald Trump\u2019s intent to end birthright citizenship, one Chinese-American\u2019s 1898 case makes the prospect of such a move not so simple.\n\nWong Kim Ark, a restaurant cook who was born in San Francisco, was barred from reentering the U.S. after a trip to visit his parents in China. Wong was arrested, and his case eventually made it to the Supreme Court, where judges ruled that under the 14th Amendment, anyone born in the U.S. is automatically a citizen.\n\nThough Trump claimed he could sign an executive order to revoke the current birthright citizenship policy, Wong\u2019s case set a precedent that\u2019s remained the law of the land for more than a century. In fact, the policy could likely only be changed through a constitutional amendment.\n\n\u201cThe bigger issue for us as a country is how do we create more pathways to citizenship, not whether we should cut it off,\u201d Aarti Kohli, executive director of Advancing Justice \u2015 Asian Law Caucus, told HuffPost. We have a lot of people who already call America home who should have the opportunity to become citizens.\n\nDepartment of Justice/National Archives Wong Kim Ark, a cook born in San Francisco, was barred from reentering the U.S. after visiting his parents in China.\n\nWong\u2019s parents had arrived in the U.S. from China during a time of fierce anti-Chinese sentiment. The era had birthed the Chinese Exclusion Act, legislation that put a 10-year moratorium on Chinese labor immigration. The act also barred courts from granting Chinese immigrants citizenship.\n\nWong\u2019s parents came to the country seeking U.S. citizenship but eventually left after the act had cut off any pathway to citizenship status. They had also feared the vigilante violence that often targeted Chinese immigrants at the time. In fact, one of the largest lynchings in American history occurred in 1871. Hundreds had descended upon Los Angeles\u2019 Chinatown, and the mob lynched an estimated 17 to 20 Chinese immigrants.\n\nBut Wong himself had a life in the United States, and, though he had traveled to China before and had been readmitted into the U.S. without any issues, his 1895 trip presented a host of problems. Authorities ordered the Chinese-American to return to the ship.\n\nChinese immigrant aid organization Six Companies stepped in to provide Wong legal help. Wong\u2019s lawyer, Thomas D. Riordan, argued that the cook\u2019s reentry into the U.S. was protected under the 14th Amendment. As the case escalated to federal court, immigration hard-liners fought back, claiming Wong\u2019s \u201caccident of birth\u201d didn\u2019t mean citizenship.\n\nIn the end, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Wong.\n\n\u201cIf the Trump administration issued an executive order, it would be immediately challenged in the courts, and judges would likely rely on Wong Kim Ark to find the executive order unconstitutional,\u201d Kohli said.\n\nMany conservatives and even officials appointed by Trump himself disagree with the president\u2019s stance on birthright citizenship.\n\n\u201cThe plain meaning of this language is clear,\u201d James Ho, whom Trump appointed as a federal appeals court judge, wrote in 2011 of the 14th Amendment.\n\nHo, then a solicitor general of Texas, wrote that \u201ca foreign national living in the United States is \u2018subject to the jurisdiction thereof\u2019 because he is legally required to obey US law.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) addressed Trump\u2019s comments, telling a Kentucky radio station earlier this week that \u201cyou cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order\u201d \u2015 to which Trump responded that Ryan \u201cknows nothing about\u201d birthright citizenship.\n\nKohli pointed out that those who oppose birthright citizenship are in the minority.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that most Americans have embraced birthright citizenship and believe that anyone who is born here should have the right to be a citizen. A few political leaders are trying to further a white supremacist agenda and create a \u2018fix\u2019 to a problem that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, \u201cMany scholars have noted that birthright citizenship has helped the U.S. integrate each new wave of immigrants as their children are recognized as U.S. citizens.\u201d", "Democrats have hammered Republican candidates in this political cycle for supporting policies that would jeopardize people\u2019s health care. But Jim Songer of Huntingburg, Indiana, says GOP Senate candidate Mike Braun personally took his insurance away.\n\nLike a lot of Republicans running for Congress right now, Braun says he really does favor health care policies that protect sick people from unfair insurance practices, a message that is contrary to his \u2015 and his party\u2019s \u2015 actual policy record.\n\nBut Braun has a trump card: In his business career, he has actually provided insurance to people \u2015 a fact he has relentlessly highlighted in debates and TV ads.\n\n\u201cJust like I\u2019ve taken care of my employees, I\u2019ll take care of Hoosiers,\u201d Braun said during a Tuesday night debate with his opponent, Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly.\n\nBut not all of Braun\u2019s former employees agree with that assessment, like the several who have sued the company for wage theft over the years.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Jim Songer. He worked for Braun\u2019s auto parts company until July, when he landed in the hospital with blood loss due to severe anemia.\n\n\u201cWhile I was in the hospital, Mike Braun fired me and backdated my termination so my insurance had been canceled,\u201d Songer says in a Donnelly TV ad that first aired last month. \u201cI was devastated.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a devastating ad. Braun\u2019s company, Meyer Distributing, fired Songer in July \u2015 as Braun\u2019s campaign was running ads about what a compassionate boss he\u2019s been.\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as health care when something happens to you and it gets taken away,\u201d Songer says in the ad. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what Mike Braun\u2019s company did.\u201d\n\nSince the ad aired on Oct. 8, neither Braun\u2019s campaign nor his company has contradicted Songer\u2019s version of events. Neither responded to requests for comment for this article.\n\nIn an interview, Songer, 58, said he\u2019d worked for Meyer Distributing for a year, selling auto accessories to dealerships around the country. He said that in July he started feeling dizzy when he would stand up. After missing three days of work in bed, he called his supervisor on July 21, fearing he\u2019d lost his job, but his supervisor said he hadn\u2019t been fired. The next day, he went to a hospital and received blood transfusions to treat his anemia. It took several days to recover.\n\nAfter he got out of the hospital, the supervisor told him he\u2019d lost his job.\n\nA \u201cNotification of Termination\u201d document dated July 23 indicates Songer had been fired for \u201cjob abandonment\u201d \u2015 i.e., not showing up to work and not calling in for the three days he was bedridden. Another document, a letter from a human resources employee with a Meyer Distributing letterhead, says his last day was July 16, because that was the last day he\u2019d come in. \u201cAdditionally, his last day of insurance coverage would have also been July 16, 2018,\u201d the letter says.\n\nThe backdated termination meant Songer was stuck with a $28,000 hospital bill that his company insurance would have paid if he hadn\u2019t been fired. Songer said he lost his apartment and has no way of paying the hospital.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been kind of a humiliating experience,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been so healthy my whole life.\u201d\n\nWhen Songer filed for unemployment insurance, Meyer Distributing fought the claim, saying he\u2019d been fired for cause, according to documents Songer shared with HuffPost. But an administrative law judge ruled in Songer\u2019s favor, citing a state law that says people fired for missing work due to illness shouldn\u2019t be disqualified. \u201cThe claimant was involuntarily unemployed as the result of a medically substantiated physical disability after making reasonable efforts to maintain the employment relationship,\u201d the administrative law judge wrote.\n\nThough the Braun campaign hasn\u2019t defended itself from Songer\u2019s accusation, it has fought back against other attacks on Meyer Distributing\u2019s health plans. The Donnelly campaign has highlighted Meyer\u2019s $5,000 deductible for individuals, which means that if an employee actually utilizes medical services during the year, the policy doesn\u2019t cover costs until the worker has spent $5,000 of his or her own money.\n\nThe average deductible for an employer-sponsored health plan is $1,573, according to the most recent data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. So Braun\u2019s company\u2019s health plan is far stingier than most. But Braun has maintained that since most people don\u2019t exceed their deductible anyway, he should get credit for having low monthly premiums.", "A black Harvard-educated doctor says she was racially profiled by employees on a Delta connection flight who questioned her medical credentials as she tried to help a fellow passenger in distress.\n\nDr. Fatima Cody Stanford, who serves as an obesity medicine physician-scientist, educator and policymaker at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, told Boston 25 News that she was flying from Indianapolis to Boston on Oct. 23 when a woman began to convulse and hyperventilate.\n\nStanford said she worked to calm the woman as she assessed her condition.

However, spokesman Anthony Black pointed out that the plane in question was being operated by another carrier, Republic Airline.

The party was a bust \u2014 hardly any of the invitees showed up, confirming what I sorta knew: My buddy wasn\u2019t popular. His parents were divorced, and he lived with his mom in an apartment; he wore the same flannel every day, and his shoes were L.A. Gears. (Three years later he\u2019d introduce me to pot smoking.)\n\nThe three of us friends who did attend found ourselves outnumbered by aunts and uncles, so we took the birthday boy on a walk down the beach, whereupon an elaborate sixth-grade flirtation ritual took shape: Two girls our age started following us, started closing in, started yelling things. In the pairing off that came next, the birthday boy, in a testament to the cruelty of childhood, found himself walking back despondently to the aunts and uncles as I sat nervously on the beach with a girl named Yvette from the Valley. It was dusk, so the sun was setting over the Pacific Ocean, and the oil rigs dotting the coastline were throwing long shadows.\n\nYvette was pretty, and we talked for what felt like a long time, but the only exchange I remember was her schooling me in the dynamics of French kissing, which she proceeded to demonstrate. Our kiss was squishy and warm and fired every neuron my little 12-year-old brain contained at that time.\n\nI never saw Yvette again after that night, but I kept coming back to that same stretch of beach, not to remember the kiss, but because it was our beach \u2014 mine and my friends\u2019, the spot closest to our high school and our houses, where we would ride our bikes to go boogie boarding. We spent whole summers at that spot. On warm weekend days it\u2019d overflow with interlopers from Riverside and Fullerton, but during summer weekdays, especially around sunset, during surf sessions when the surface of the ocean would become flat and glassy, it felt as if we had the place all to ourselves.\n\nTwenty-eight years later, I\u2019m sitting at a picnic table in what\u2019s technically the parking lot of our beach, next to a barrel full of ice and RockStar energy drinks, asking the members of seminal LA ska band Fishbone what it\u2019s like to turn 40, an imminent event in my case, and one that I am dreading.\n\n\u201cYou see this gray beard?\u201d asks Philip Fisher, aka Fish, the band\u2019s drummer. \u201cDo I look like I give a fuck about getting older? No, I embrace it.\u201d\n\nIf you want to feel better about getting older, or at least gain some perspective on it, talk to a handful of people who\u2019ve been playing in ska bands for 20 years. This was the premise that landed me backstage at the Back to the Beach Festival, a two-day celebration of third-wave ska whose inaugural installment was going down in Huntington Beach. Over the course of two days, 30,000 fans would come to see a lineup of bands who had their heyday during the Clinton administration: Sublime, Goldfinger, 311, Save Ferris, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Fishbone, Less than Jake, The Aquabats.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t remember or never learned, third-wave ska was one of the more ignominious blips on the \u201990s pop-culture continuum. Centered in Southern California, with clusters of bands in Florida and New York, its most lasting cultural contributions include soundtracking a number of \u201990s rom-coms, popularizing the then-novel semi-ironic cover (as in Reel Big Fish\u2019s \u201cTake On Me\u201d) and gifting the world with No Doubt, the heavyweight champ of ska bands who took third-wave ska to the apex of mainstream popularity, despite almost totally jettisoning most of the genre\u2019s signature qualities \u2014 horn sections, skanking, making an ass of oneself. These tweaks were not accidental.\n\nLizzy Gonzalez The skankers of the Back to the Beach Festival, in Huntington Beach.\n\nBecause yes, definitely, for sure: Ska sucks, specifically third-wave ska. Few musical movements can compete for the derision it routinely receives, if it receives any thought at all. In an era during which nostalgia acts are a key part of major festival bills, ska gets the cold shoulder. To be playing this music in 2018 requires a special kind of obliviousness to its wider perception, a near imperviousness to self-doubt and embarrassment. As someone riddled with such feelings as I approach my fourth decade, I figured it might be good to surround myself with such naive optimism. I mean, just look at Fish\u2019s brother and Fishbone bassist Norwood here:\n\n\u201cI got a friend who told me he cried when he turned 40,\u201d Norwood says (his full name is John Norwood Fisher, but everyone just calls him Norwood). \u201cYou know, because he thought he was getting old. And I was like, I\u2019m celebrating it! Something got better. The older I get, the more I\u2019m like: Oh wow, this is what it\u2019s like if you live in the moment and you can appreciate it. I\u2019ve refined my role in life as I got older, and it\u2019s just better.\u201d\n\nAs Norwood finishes this thought, a roadie swings by to remind the brothers of their next appointment, which is fortuitous, because I can tell by their body language that they\u2019re not amused by the subtext of my questions. \u201cSad 40-Year-Old Man Attends Ska Show\u201d was the working title for this article. In contrast to some of my professional peers backstage, I\u2019m apparently wearing this headline across my face. Next to me near the picnic tables, a woman in her 20s is wearing six-inch spikes in her heels and 12-inch spikes in her hair, asking excited questions to all the bands for some kind of web series. For a certain type of person, Back to the Beach feels like a triumphant reunion, something to feel proud and excited about. It feels like something else to me.\n\n\u201cThe ageless thing is inside,\u201d Fish says. \u201cI just try to keep the whole package oiled and moving. Speaking of which, we gotta go.\u201d\n\nMaybe one reason (among many reasons) that third-wave ska seems so stupid and embarrassing is that it seems to be gleefully squandering a rich musical inheritance. It can be traced all the way back to 1950s Jamaica, when American rhythm and blues songs like Fats Domino\u2019s \u201cBe My Guest\u201d were popularized and then imitated by Jamaican soundsystem DJs like Prince Buster and Coxsone Dodd. In the hands of these Jamaicans, the shuffle became the skank \u2014 that emphasis on the upbeat that distinguishes ska and reggae, which arrived on ska\u2019s heels (that\u2019s right: ska came first). The first wave of ska included artists like the Skatalites, Derrick Morgan and Desmond Dekker. Many of these artists\u2019 songs were informed by and sometimes directly celebrate Jamaica\u2019s independence from England in 1962, which goes some way toward explaining why a fundamental quality of ska is its slack-jawed ebullience.\n\nFrom Jamaica, the music jumped over to the U.K., where it was given a mod makeover and mixed with elements of pub rock, punk, then new wave. This was ska\u2019s second wave, also known as 2-Tone, a term coined by the Specials\u2019 Jerry Dammers. The term \u201c2-Tone\u201d was a explicit nod to ska\u2019s miscegenation and a direct rebuke to phenomena like the U.K.\u2019s fascist National Front. With their black and white duds, two-tone album covers and songs like \u201cDo the Dog,\u201d The Specials codified some of ska\u2019s most important, longstanding themes \u2014 fighting racism, imploring unity and wearing funny hats. And they were soon joined by acts like Madness (named after a Prince Buster song that they then popularized), The English Beat, The Selecter and others in introducing ska to a much wider audience, which is of course what brings us to ska\u2019s third wave.\n\nTo say that someone like Prince Buster or Jerry Dammers might have had a hard time imagining the music they helped pioneer and shape being played by a group of Mormons dressed like Space Ghost is, I dunno, maybe an understatement? Nevertheless, here we are. From the Specials, ska found its way into the hands of bands like Boston\u2019s Mighty Mighty Bosstones, L.A.\u2019s Fishbone and, perhaps as importantly, the Bay Area\u2019s Operation Ivy, who mashed it up with both the sound and attitude of American hardcore punk. With Op Ivy showing the punk kids how to skank, it was only a matter of time before a bunch of them recruited members of the high school marching band to outfit their songs with horn riffs, which is how we got to No Doubt, Reel Big Fish, Skankin\u2019 Pickle, Save Ferris and all the rest, including the Aquabats, a band formed mostly by members of the Church of Latter-day Saints, whose little ditty \u201cPinch and Roll\u201d prescribes the specific technique for scratching one\u2019s balls that I have followed for the entirety of my adult life.\n\nNow, do I feel bad that a music so thick with history and purpose became, in its third wave, a vehicle for dispensing advice about how to scratch one\u2019s nutz, celebrating the palliative effects of malted beverages and/or grousing about missing the bus? Should anyone feel bad about that? Does anyone? Allow me to invoke the persona of the Aquabats\u2019 \u201cBat Commander\u201d in saying, I dunno, kids \u2014 let\u2019s find out!\n\nTwo days before the festival, I visit the Aquabats in the Fountain Valley rehearsal space where they\u2019re practicing for their set. In their heyday, these guys were one of the most popular and successful third-wave ska bands extant. Known for their spandex costumes and kitschy stage shows \u2014 a mash-up of \u201cBarbarella\u201d and Captain Kangaroo \u2014 the band eventually landed a short-lived kids TV series, and its frontman, Christian Jacobs, was one of the creators of the popular Nickelodeon show \u201cYo Gabba Gabba!\u201d which was itself largely informed by the Aquabats\u2019 aesthetic.\n\n\u201cGarrett!\u201d Jacobs says when I poke my head in the rehearsal space. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize you without the glasses.\u201d\n\nOh, I probably should have mentioned this before: I was a devoted ska kid growing up. My first shows were ska shows, my best friends were ska friends. I played in a band called Tricky Dump Truck, an allusion to the scatting at the heart of ska (pick-it-up-pick-it-up). We booked exactly three shows. Back then I was beanpole skinny and wore the kind of thick Buddy Holly glasses you used to only be able to find at thrift stores. And I attended tons and tons of shows, including many of the Aquabats\u2019 early shows, on bills they shared with all my favorite bands of that time: Reel Big Fish, Skankin\u2019 Pickle, Dance Hall Crashers. If this lede feels buried, that\u2019s on purpose.\n\n\u201cYou guys,\u201d Jacobs announces to the group, \u201cGarrett\u2019s here to write an article about people who waste their lives playing in a band.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting here that I didn\u2019t have to inform Jacobs of these intentions in advance for it to be obvious. For as long as I can remember, the current and former members of the Aquabats whom I\u2019m personally acquainted with, including Jacobs, have never been anything less than exceedingly self-deprecating about the fact that their primary occupation as artists and musicians is to dress up in cheap costumes and perform songs like \u201cMartian Girl\u201d and \u201cSuper Rad.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we were doing almost felt farcical in a way,\u201d Jacobs will explain of the band\u2019s early days, the two of us standing around in the parking lot after practice, bathed in the glow of suburban street lights. \u201cWhat we felt about the ska scene was it was just fun, it was stupid, it was corny, and we were being stupid right along with it. We were the cherry on top of the stupid.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, somehow, they\u2019ve been doing this for 20 years. Here in the rehearsal space, everyone looks a bit heavier than he did in the band\u2019s heyday. And now that these guys are all suburban dads, their claim to superhero alter-egos like \u201cCrash McLarson\u201d is specious at best. (Crash himself, aka founding member Chad Larson, sits in a folding chair for the whole practice session.) Watching them rehearse songs like \u201cIdiot Box\u201d and \u201cPool Party\u201d as various members\u2019 preteen daughters sit quietly in a corner is particularly surreal, as is listening to Jacobs strategize with his bandmates in between songs about how he can score tickets to next week\u2019s sold-out LCD Soundsystem show. It\u2019s like poking your head in on Big Bird watching CNN; it\u2019s just incongruous.\n\nSka was a joke. Even back in the day, it was so difficult for anyone to pay attention to it. Pick-it-up, pick-it-up, pick-it-up \u2014 it was a joke. John Feldmann, lead singer of Goldfinger\n\nAfter practice, which ends around 9 p.m. in a state of total sobriety, the band members go home to their wives and kids. But at the show two days later, they will slay the crowd of 30,000. As the Bat Commander, Jacobs will lead his troupe through songs like \u201cThe Cat with 2 Heads\u201d and in battle with the villainous Sand Fleas, one of the Aquabats\u2019 signature mid-show melodramas. He will then invite onstage Back to the Beach co-producer Travis Barker \u2014 yes, that Travis Barker, of Blink-182 and reality TV fame, who got his first big break as \u201cBaron Von Tito,\u201d drummer for the Aquabats \u2014 to run through classics like \u201cPowdered Milk Man.\u201d For a certain type of ska fan, including your correspondent, this move will provoke pangs of heartwarming nostalgia and genuine glee.\n\n\u201cSome people play basketball at the park,\u201d Jacobs tells me in the parking lot. \u201cWe put on rubber helmets and play shows.\u201d\n\nAfter the set, Barker will go back to skulking around the backstage area with his extensive entourage and various members of the Aquabats will go back to their day-jobs as cabinet makers and electricians. For a few moments, we\u2019ll all be basking in the glow of childhood wonder, but it won\u2019t take long for us to return to reality, the reality where ska sucks.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon I sit down with Monique Powell, the singer and sole remaining original member of Save Ferris, which is most famous for its ska cover of the Dexy\u2019s Midnight Runners song \u201cCome On Eileen,\u201d as well as the single \u201cThe World Is New,\u201d which, like so many third-wave ska songs, made a number of appearances in cheesy mid-\u201990s rom-coms (Save Ferris had a cameo in the Heath Ledger-Julia Stiles flick \u201c10 Things I Hate About You\u201d).\n\nA reconstituted Save Ferris is playing tomorrow, which means the band doesn\u2019t have its own trailer backstage today, so Powell and her team have set up a makeshift tent in a special VIP section, complete with a cooler full of cold drinks and a couple of beach chairs, all of it set up in order to receive inquiring minds like myself.\n\nDaniel Rojas A reconstituted Save Ferris performs at the Back to the Beach Festival. You're grown. So grown.\n\nPowell is 42, and today her look \u2014 bleach-blond hair, big glasses, white jumpsuit \u2014 is that of someone who will eventually retire near slot machines. I didn\u2019t know her very well back in the day, but we attended some of the same shows and backyard parties, or at least that\u2019s what we conclude after comparing notes \u2014 Reel Big Fish at Al Cappuccino, No Doubt at Viva Las Vegas. Today, in her own personal makeshift press tent, Powell is solicitous and endearing \u2014 she asks me as many questions as I ask her, especially once she discovers that we both survived life-threatening illnesses in the not-too-distant past.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you mine if you tell me yours,\u201d she says excitedly.\n\nI tell her about having testicular cancer, which is a true story I\u2019ve never quite figured out how to tell. Certainly it happened \u2014 I was diagnosed, had surgery to remove my right testicle two days later, spent anxious weeks waiting to see if tests would reveal whether we\u2019d got it all or if it had spread to my lymph nodes, was eventually declared cancer-free (we caught it early, etc.) without ever having to do chemo \u2014 but in my case it happened so quickly and relatively easily that I feel weird calling myself a cancer survivor, even though that\u2019s technically what I am. The reason I bring this up is because when I was first diagnosed and during those first few weeks after, when the test results were still outstanding and the worst-case scenario was very much a possibility, I never made any kind of bucket list. I didn\u2019t promise myself I\u2019d finish my novel or pledge to visit a holy site or anything like that. For whatever reason, this brush with \u2026 whatever it was, was for me one of the least regretful times of my life, which I\u2019ve always found odd.\n\nThis was not the case for Powell. As it turns out, at around the same time I was dealing with my cancer, Powell was diagnosed with spinal stenosis, a condition that required risky surgery she was told she might not even survive.\n\n\u201cI made a deal with my dad,\u201d she explains. \u201cRight before I went into surgery, I promised him that if I woke up and if I could still sing and still walk then I was gonna bring the band back.\u201d\n\nThis she did, recording and releasing a new EP that her father sang on. Then, sadly, he passed away. But Powell pressed on. She took Save Ferris back out on the Warped Tour in 2017, and is currently working on new material, coincidentally with one of the members of LCD Soundsystem (\u201cTell Christian I can get him tickets.\u201d). Powell\u2019s brush with death imbued her with renewed purpose, a determination to literally get the band back together. Here she sits, triumphant, ready to once again share the joys of ska.\n\nThis is a heartwarming story, but it has a flip side: It\u2019s Powell\u2019s readymade press hook, the one she\u2019s been offering to anyone who will listen. I was disappointed to discover that she\u2019d shared it (and was quoted) nearly verbatim with a reporter from OC Weekly last year. Undoubtedly, it\u2019s part of her strategy for rehabilitating Save Ferris\u2019 image following a very tumultuous decade or so during which Powell and her former band members sued one another for control of the band\u2019s name, with the \u201cwinner\u201d securing the right to play county fairs and nostalgia festivals like Back to the Beach. The whole affair was sufficiently heated as to create factions among the scene, and Powell\u2019s become a kind of persona non grata to the extent that pitching her media tent a hundred feet from the backstage area may be more than just a symbolic gesture.\n\nLike the Aquabats, Save Ferris kills it during their appointed set the next day; if there are detractors in the crowd upset about the brouhaha, none of them reveals himself or herself that I can see. Sporting her signature cherry-red bouffant wig, Powell performs three costume changes, peeling off layers to reveal skimpier and skimpier outfits beneath. At one point she invites Angelo Moore from Fishbone up on stage with her, which is the third-wave ska equivalent of Harry Connick Jr. singing a duet with Sinatra.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you what happens immediately after Save Ferris\u2019 set, but I do know that in the weeks and months after Back to the Beach, the band will continue to tour. They\u2019ll play a string of dates in Vegas, as well as festivals in England. They\u2019ll release a live album and continue working on new material. I say \u201cthey\u201d but it\u2019s really just Powell at this point, going it alone with a crew of mercenary giggers. Having cheated death, she\u2019s back in the only place that makes sense, on stage performing a rippin\u2019 version of a Dexy\u2019s Midnight Runners song. During our interview I ask her if playing ska at 42 still feels like living the dream: \u201cFor me, absolutely.\u201d\n\nI talk to a bunch of other aging ska musicians. I talk to Joe Gittleman, the avuncular founding bass player for the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, who\u2019s a college professor most months of the year and a member of the one of the world\u2019s most influential third-wave ska bands on his days off. Gittleman went on sabbatical recently to help write and record the Bosstones\u2019 first new record in seven years. We talk about how when it comes to nostalgia acts, ska bands seem to get overlooked by mainstream festival bookers, that the music has never been re-evaluated or at the very least embraced lovingly if ironically a la yacht rock or synth pop.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of value in ska music,\u201d says Gittleman. He points to the tradition of advocating unity in the face of racial divisions, first as embodied by the 2-Tone scene, then as symbolized by the plaid worn by the third-wave bands. This is worthy message, even if it\u2019s somewhat undermined by the preponderance of caucasian faces at the festival.\n\nWhether you buy into the diversity angle or not, Gittleman thinks, and I agree, that ska is just plain fun. \u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s wrong with having fun?\u201d he asks. \u201cJust for the sake of argument, let\u2019s assume that\u2019s all it is. What the fuck\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\n\nI interview Chuck Robertson, the singer from the Mad Caddies, who looks every bit like the single dad he now is: handsome if a little dinged up, nursing a longneck and a smoke. The Caddies are a ska band from Central California that never had a big break but still draw well enough to tour and play the occasional nostalgia-act cruise ship (specifically, ahem, \u201cFlogging Molly\u2019s Salty Dog Cruise\u201d). Seated next to a mason jar full of sticky green nugs in the band\u2019s trailer, Robertson tells me about the beach party he had for his own recent 40th birthday, which arrived shortly after a painful divorce. He credits the songwriting sessions behind the band\u2019s new record, \u201cPunk Rocksteady,\u201d with helping him through the dissolution of his marriage. \u201cWith the pain of my divorce,\u201d he says, \u201cthat lit me up like I\u2019ve never been lit up.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cWhen you\u2019re young, you really take everything for granted. Now I have this newfound appreciation of how lucky we are to be able to do this, to just keep going.\u201d\n\nI talk to the guys in Hepcat, who are one of my favorite groups at this festival and probably the least successful in terms of metrics: their releases are few and far between; they rarely tour; they have no outsize shtick. Hepcat play a brand of laid-back soulful ska that\u2019s as close to the Jamaican original as any of the bands from ska\u2019s third wave. The most noteworthy thing about the band, aside from the fact that they really do make great music, is that their singer, Alex D\u00e9sert, is the guy in \u201cSwingers\u201d who says about all LA parties, \u201cThis place is dead anyway.\u201d His advice to me about turning 40 is this: \u201cJust remember when you get your prostate examined that he or she is a trained professional.\u201d\n\nBut the guy who has what is in my opinion the most interesting and balanced perspective on all this \u2014 both the cultural phenomenon that is third-wave ska and the biological reality that is aging \u2014 also happens to be the guy who\u2019s made the most money off it, Back to the Beach\u2019s co-producer John Feldmann. With his short bleached hair, tasteful tan and lithe surfer\u2019s body, Feldmann, or Feldy, as he\u2019s known and consistently referred to, is an unsubtle ad for the age-defying effects of being rich and living in Southern California. Feldy is best known as the founding member of Goldfinger, whose song \u201cHere in Your Bedroom\u201d is nominally ska but definitely one of the more ubiquitous hits of the era, with an enormous earworm chorus that sounds like it was delivered by ocean liner. After launching several hits with Goldfinger, Feldmann became a successful writer/producer/Svengali in the alt-rock world, minting new bands and contributing to a slew of hit records. He\u2019s like the Rick Rubin of mall punk.\n\n\u201cI wanna be a good dad, I wanna be a good performer,\u201d he says in his trailer backstage. \u201cBut I wanna go to bed at night saying, \u2018I fucking like who I am.\u2019\u201d Feldy meditates and reads books like Three Magic Words. The only thing he acknowledges slowing down as he\u2019s aged is his libido \u2014 \u201cMy drive for humping isn\u2019t quite what it used to be\u201d \u2014 but other than that his ambition has remained steady and constant, even if happiness has become more elusive over time.\n\n\u201cI know now, being 50, that career success and money do not equal happiness on any level,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that there\u2019s definitely more abundance of happiness when I was striving to get here. But you can\u2019t go backwards. Once you fly business class and lay down on your way to England and sleep, how do you go back to coach?\u201d\n\nFeldy strives to live in the moment, and thinks this is generally a good idea. \u201cIf I\u2019m hard on myself, I\u2019m gonna be hard on others,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I look back and say, \u2018God, you could have done better, John, if only you did this different,\u2019 then I\u2019m gonna do that to my kids, I\u2019m gonna do that to my wife, I\u2019m gonna do it to the people I work with, and who wants to be around that guy?\u201d\n\nFeldy\u2019s the one who had the idea to attempt Back to the Beach, as well as the connections to actually execute it. After Goldfinger played a similar nostalgia fest focused on \u201990s punk, Punk in Drublic, Feldy decided it was time ska had its moment. So he called his buddies in Sublime, Fishbone, The Bosstones, Less than Jake. \u201cI just said, Can we do a ska festival in Huntington Beach? Will you do it if I put it on? Instantly, everyone was like, \u2018Fuck yeah.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere was only one band that couldn\u2019t play the festival: Reel Big Fish. The act had already signed on to play the Warped Tour, so a gig in Huntington Beach would violate their radius clause. This was a glaring omission and huge disappointment, because Reel Big Fish are among Orange County\u2019s most popular and successful third-wave ska bands. Feldy, however, had planned a surprise that would help ease the blow: \u201cAaron [Reel Big Fish\u2019s singer] is going to play \u2018Sell Out\u2019 with Goldfinger tomorrow.\u201d\n\nYes! \u201cSell Out.\u201d If there was a single song I wanted to hear most this weekend to complete the nostalgia trip, it was \u201cSell Out.\u201d \u201cSell Out\u201d is many things \u2014 a technically excellent songwriter\u2019s song, a rousing banger if third-wave ska ever had one \u2014 but it\u2019s primarily the best illustration of how quixotic this barbarically stupid genre\u2019s worldview was.\n\nYou see, for as patently ridiculous as third-wave ska is/was, the genre\u2019s adherents inherited one of punk\u2019s most strident values, one that in today\u2019s world seems quaint: an aversion to becoming too successful. Imagine that! Seriously, imagine it: It\u2019s 1995, you\u2019re in a group where half the members are acne-strewn horn players from the high school marching band, you all wear bowling shirts onstage and sing about breakfast cereal and space aliens, and one of your primary concerns in life is that you might achieve a level of mainstream fame and acceptance that would compromise your carefully manicured value system. You play third-wave ska, and you\u2019re worried you might just get too rich doing it.\n\nWhat\u2019s really amazing here is that there was a moment circa 1996, the year I graduated high school, where this seemed like a real possibility \u2014 that if you weren\u2019t careful, you might actually get rich. No Doubt was just starting to blow up MTV, and major label A&R scouts were becoming as common at ska shows as plaid pants. All the bands I knew secretly or not-so-secretly had their hearts set on the label machine reaching out and taking their hands, leading them into a world of fame and fortune and hookers and god knows what else \u2014 for playing ska! I mean, shit, look at the Aquabats! They had not one, but two TV shows. Christian Jacobs has been telling people how to scratch their balls for more than two decades.\n\nThis all seems especially surreal against the backdrop of the music\u2019s history. The anti-colonialism and anti-capitalism of first- and second-wave ska had given way to a third wave that dispensed with most of the politics but retained the anti-bourgeois gestures. Selling out was the key issue now; the deeper political question of who was doing the buying had been left in the past. This was music made for and by people who had the privilege of wondering if they really needed the money. It was stupid and embarrassing, and it was also aware that it was stupid and embarrassing, but it was not exactly sure why. And it was this dynamic that, coincidentally or not (let\u2019s say not), attracted me to this music as a gawky, self-conscious teenager and that persists here, now, to this day, as a gawky, self-conscious adult. This inchoate regret is strong stuff, to tweak an old line of J.D. Salinger\u2019s, and it\u2019s the animating essence of both third-wave ska and \u201cSell Out,\u201d a song that both prompted Reel Big Fish\u2019s incredible, unpredictable success and served as a pre-emptive apologia for it.\n\nWombat Goldfinger's John Feldmann, king again for a day.\n\nWhich brings us to Sunday evening, when Reel Big Fish\u2019s Aaron Barrett comes trotting out during Goldfinger\u2019s set like Bruce Springsteen sitting in with Billy Joel, that is, if Springsteen had been sporting the same mutton chop sideburns and Hawaiian shirt for 25 years. The first song he plays with the band is Goldfinger\u2019s hit \u201cSuperman,\u201d which sounds decidedly like a Reel Big Fish song, maybe not coincidentally (\u201cThis guy played my wedding,\u201d Feldy informs the crowd when he introduces Barrett). Then they launch into \u201cSell Out.\u201d The horns blare like the drunkest guy at a New Year\u2019s party, the song explodes like Evil Knievel jumping the Grand Canyon. I stand there in awe, a boneheaded grin slathered across my face that I couldn\u2019t wipe off if I tried. Barrett sings: \u201cThe record company\u2019s gonna give me lots of money / And everything\u2019s gonna be all right.\u201d In the middle of the song, Feldy hurls himself into the crowd, surfing along outstretched arms until he\u2019s out in the middle of the throng. They prop him so he\u2019s standing upright, his arms outstretched, chin thrust to the heavens, lording over that which he has wrought, these tens of thousands of knucklehead ska fans, including your correspondent, having a blast on our beach.\n\n\u201cSka was a joke,\u201d Feldy had told me back in his trailer. \u201cEven back in the day, it was so difficult for anyone to pay attention to it. Pick-it-up, pick-it-up, pick-it-up \u2014 it was a joke. But I think that it permeated the culture. And obviously people want to have a good time. We\u2019re living in this weird era with this fucking president that makes no logical sense, and we\u2019re all trying to connect the pieces and go, \u2018Are we really living right now? Are we alive?\u2019\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know where regret comes from, or why some people experience it more deeply and frequently than others. I don\u2019t know what worry is \u2014 what are the chemicals, what are the contents of the thoughts? It feels a certain way and I feel it constantly, but I can never seem to describe the feeling to my satisfaction. Some people turn 40 and it\u2019s no big deal; some people face death and it\u2019s no big deal. I am one and not the other. I am both at once.\n\nI spent the night of my first kiss in a sleeping bag at the birthday boy\u2019s house in a neighborhood we all referred to as \u201cslums,\u201d which is a cruel description looking back (I regret it). When I woke up the next morning, this first thing I did was call my mom. For some reason I\u2019d felt guilty in the aftermath of my first kiss \u2014 not because my friend\u2019s feelings were hurt, which they were, but because, well, I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019d experienced something thrilling, and one of my first reactions was to feel shame about it, to feel my first initial pangs of that inchoate regret, to apologize to \u2026 someone.

Taxis and ride-sharing currently account for just 1.7 percent of trips in America\u2019s largest cities, but are growing exponentially. By the end of 2018, Uber and Lyft are projected to carry more people than local bus systems.\n\nAnd yet, as more information has revealed the relationship between ride-sharing and congestion \u2014 and its other negative impacts on cities \u2014 Uber and Lyft continue to design products and roll out services almost guaranteed to make it worse.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re deliberately redesigning themselves to compete with public transport,\u201d said Bruce Schaller, a former Deputy Commissioner for the New York City Department of Transportation and the author of a series of studies on ride-sharing. \u201cThat means millions of people swapping efficient transport for inefficient transport, and a lot more empty seats driving around cities.\u201d\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Lawmakers in New York City recently imposed a cap on ride-hailing vehicles.\n\nHow More Car Sharing Leads to Worse Congestion\n\nFor years, the link between increased ride-hailing and reduced congestion was clear: Cheap, immediate and abundant taxi rides would encourage city residents to give up their cars. Uber Pool and Lyft\u2019s Shared Rides, which pick up extra riders along their routes, would act like city-wide carpooling agencies, combining passengers and extending the reach of public transportation. Plus, since ride-sharing doesn\u2019t require parking, cities could reclaim outdoor car storage for wider sidewalks and protected bike lanes.\n\nBut in the last few years, as ride-sharing has expanded to dozens of cities and billions of rides, nearly all of these assumptions have been proven wrong or wildly optimistic.\n\nFirst, ride-sharing hasn\u2019t reduced the number of cars on the roads. As taxi rides have come down in price, they have boomed in popularity. San Francisco now has over 20 times more ride-share vehicles than official cabs. In New York, registered \u201ctransportation network company\u201d cars outnumber yellow cabs six to one. While some city residents have indeed given up their vehicles in favor of car sharing, others have purchased cars specifically to drive for Uber and Lyft. A University of Chicago study published in October found that cities with more ride-sharing had 3 percent higher car ownership rates that those with less ride-sharing.\n\nSecond, swapping solo drivers for car shares hasn\u2019t reduced the number of miles city residents are racking up on the roads. \u201cSwitching from your own car to an Uber actually adds miles because the car has to come pick you up,\u201d Schaller said. His study from earlier this year found that UberX \u2014 one driver picking up one passenger \u2014 adds 2.8 vehicle miles to the road for every mile of driving it eliminates.\n\n\u201cIt would be great if Uber and Lyft carried small groups of people, but in fact they overwhelmingly carry solo riders,\u201d said Jarrett Walker, a transit planner and policy consultant. Uber drivers have to get to their first passenger, then end up taking significant detours along the route to pick up their second or third. And that\u2019s when they pick up a second passenger at all: According to internal company data obtained by BuzzFeed, 40 percent of Uber Pool trips in San Francisco ended up as solo rides in 2015, a time when Uber was heavily subsidizing fares to make the service more popular. Plus, Walker points out, ride-sharing is only available in a handful of U.S. cities. \u201cAnd when it is,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s not that much cheaper than solo rides, which is a signal that the idea isn\u2019t really that profitable.\u201d\n\nThird, rather than augmenting and assisting more efficient forms of transportation, Uber and Lyft are poaching from them. Two separate studies have found that the majority of Uber and Lyft riders would have walked, biked or taken public transit if ride-hailing wasn\u2019t available. In one study, a University of Colorado researcher became an Uber driver and surveyed his passengers. Only around one in five, he found, replaced driving alone with his taxi ride.\n\n\u201cWhen you ask people who say they\u2019re replacing personal auto trips why they take ride-sharing instead, it turns out they\u2019re taking Uber and Lyft to the airport, when they go out drinking and when they travel to avoid renting a car,\u201d Schaller said. \u201cThose are all replacing public transit trips.\u201d Plus, since ride-share passengers tend to be more affluent than city averages, Schaller said, ride-hailing could be enticing the wealthy out of buses and trains altogether, creating a two-tier system and eroding public support and funding for more efficient forms of transport in the long term.\n\nThe tech companies\u2019 predictions about parking haven\u2019t come true either. Instead of circling the block looking for spaces, drivers circle the block looking for passengers. In San Francisco, Uber and Lyft account for nearly three-quarters of the increase in congestion in the Financial District, where traffic is already gridlocked, but almost none in the suburbs. The explanation is simple: The demand for taxi rides is highest in neighborhoods where driving and parking are a hassle, namely job centers and cultural hotspots. The more time drivers spend in those neighborhoods looking for fares, the more they\u2019ll get.\n\nAnd none of this takes into account the broader impacts of ride-sharing on cities. A recent University of Chicago study found that Uber and Lyft may have increased traffic deaths by up to 3 percent. Driver wages, after factoring in the cost of owning a vehicle, could be less than $10 per hour. Both ride-hailing companies have spent years fighting court battles to prevent their drivers from unionizing. Even if their impact on traffic were a net positive, it\u2019s worth asking what cities are giving up to achieve it.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A study by the San Francisco County Transportation Authority concluded that ride-hailing accounted for roughly half the increase in congestion between 2010 and 2016.\n\nSuperficial Actions To Reduce Car Dependency\n\nNot surprisingly, the ride-sharing companies dispute nearly every aspect of the evidence above. In an interview, Lyft spokeswoman Campbell Matthews acknowledged that congestion is getting worse in big cities, but she added that the impact of Lyft and Uber is dwarfed by larger forces such as urbanization, ailing public transit systems and increases in freight and construction activity. She provided links to studies from New York, Chicago and San Francisco indicating that the worst increases in congestion predate the introduction of ride-sharing and pointed out that despite the rapid expansion of Lyft and Uber in the Bay Area, congestion actually fell last year.\n\nMatthews also stressed that Lyft sees itself as a partner to public transit. According to internal data, she said, 56 percent of rides in New York City begin and end outside of Manhattan\u2019s congested core, indicating that ride-sharing serves populations that lack access to frequent bus and train routes. The company is also partnering with transit agencies to provide \u201clast mile\u201d services from the nearest public transit stop to their door. In Monrovia, California, for example, residents can pay just 50 cents for a ride to an LA Metro stop. In Boston, Lyft is partnering with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority to provide paratransit for riders with disabilities.\n\nUber, which did not respond to requests to comment for this article, has made similar public statements. The company\u2019s CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, said earlier this year that \u201cThe great goal is getting rid of car ownership.\u201d Spokeswoman Alix Anfang told USA Today in February that \u201cUber\u2019s long-term goal is to end the reliance on personal vehicles and allow a mix of public transportation and services like Uber.\u201d\n\nBut both companies\u2019 core products and strategies contradict their respective accounts. Earlier this year, Uber launched \u201cExpress Pool,\u201d a service that allows users to catch ride-share vehicles along common routes for just $2 \u2014 a price and service nearly identical to a bus route. Lyft\u2019s similar \u201cShuttle\u201d service is only available during commute hours, the time of day when roads are busiest and the company is most likely to compete with public transit.\n\nWhat Lyft wants us to imagine just doesn\u2019t align with their profit motive. Jarrett Walker, a transit planner and policy consultant\n\nBoth companies describe their relationships with public transit agencies as \u201cpartnerships,\u201d but in reality look more like replacements. In Summit, New Jersey, for example, city leaders are providing subsidized Lyft rides to the commuter train station \u2015 funding that could have been spent on a shuttle service, expanded bus routes or other incentives for local residents to walk or bike to the station. Five cities in central Florida have experimented with giving up on public transit altogether in favor of funding Uber rides, a policy almost certain to put more miles of driving on the road.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe the math that says Lyft can be efficient doing zillions of one- to two-mile trips to transit stops,\u201d Walker said. \u201cShort trips are inefficient and drivers don\u2019t like them. Ever taken a taxi to a transit station and had the driver pitch you on taking you all the way to your destination? What Lyft wants us to imagine just doesn\u2019t align with their profit motive.\u201d\n\nAnd public transit agencies aren\u2019t the ride-hailing companies\u2019 only partnerships. In nine cities and one state, Uber uses WageWorks to let employees spend their pre-tax income on UberPool rides \u2014 a benefit that only applies to commuters and is designed around the destinations and times of day most likely to add to congestion. Uber also works with Getaround, a service that allows car owners to rent out their vehicles when they\u2019re not in use \u2015 and encourages car ownership. Even the company\u2019s marketing undermines mass transit: A 2016 ad depicted a woman on a train platform with the text, \u201cYou can\u2019t miss an Uber.\u201d\n\nOther efforts to reduce car dependency have the same superficiality. Earlier this year, Lyft launched the \u201cDitch Your Car Challenge,\u201d a rewards program for city residents who pledged to give up driving for a month. The company\u2019s founder described it as a \u201cconcerted effort to jolt Americans out of their comfort zones and persuade them to give up the convenience of personal car ownership.\u201d Behind the grand rhetoric, however, the program was only available once, to 50 people per city, and appears to have brought back more in earned media than the company spent subsidizing shared rides.\n\nThen there are the numbers. Lyft claims to have enticed 250,000 people to give up their cars in 2017, but that figure is based on a customer survey for which the company has released only a two-sentence methodology. Uber\u2019s claim that it saved more than 315 million global vehicle miles in 2017 is similarly unsupported.\n\nIt\u2019s a way of getting fewer vehicles on the street and deflecting other forms of regulation. Bruce Schaller, a former Deputy Commissioner for the New York City Department of Transportation\n\nWhen pressed on these discrepancies, Uber and Lyft often point to their political advocacy as an example of their efforts to reduce car ownership and urban congestion. Uber recently announced a $10 million effort to promote congestion pricing \u2014 a fee for drivers entering cities\u2019 most gridlocked areas. Lyft has supported similar efforts, and Matthews pointed to the company\u2019s campaigns to replace parking spots with driver pickup areas as examples of its advocacy to reduce traffic.\n\nAs Schaller pointed out, however, these policies substantially benefit the ride-hailing companies. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of getting fewer vehicles on the street and deflecting other forms of regulation,\u201d he said. Congestion pricing would discourage other limits on ride-hailing such as New York\u2019s recently passed cap on Uber and Lyft vehicles. It would also charge drivers to enter cities but not to take short trips within them, a structure that benefits taxi companies (and encourages rides on scooters and e-bikes, another sector both companies are investing in).\n\nUber and Lyft\u2019s campaigns to replace parking spaces with ride-hailing spots are even more directly beneficial. Neither company appears to have ever advocated for the removal of car lanes in favor of space for pedestrians, cyclists or public transit. While Lyft participated in an effort to improve the flow of traffic on Valencia Street in San Francisco, its contributions appear aimed at expanding loading zones and improving its drop-off and pickup times. While it\u2019s no surprise that ride-hailing companies lobby for their interests, these efforts seem less about reducing car dependency than simply swapping one form of it for another.\n\nWhich is why, Schaller said, policymakers need to step in. As ride-sharing grows and traffic continues to worsen, city leaders need to encourage functioning, efficient, sustainable transit systems. Uber and Lyft, as profit-making enterprises, won\u2019t be compatible with those aims.", "Following the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue last week, the vast majority of Americans are concerned about political incivility causing further violence, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.\n\nNinety-two percent of Democrats are concerned or very concerned the negative tone in Washington will result in violence, versus 70 percent of Republicans.\n\nNearly 80 percent in total believe the lack of civility could lead to more violence, but who is blamed for that incivility depends largely on the party affiliation of those surveyed on Oct. 28 and 29. Seventy-one percent of Democrats think President Donald Trump is to blame, while 86 percent of Republicans blame either Congress (44 percent) or the media (42 percent). Forty-five percent of independents also believe Trump is most to blame.\n\nA previous HuffPost/YouGov survey found that half of Americans believed the president had no responsibility for the actions of an attempted mail bomber. Cesar Sayoc is accused of sending at least 14 bombs through the mail to CNN and high-profile people who are regularly targeted in Trump\u2019s rhetoric. None of the bombs detonated.", "Courtesy of Seeing Red Nebraska Jeff Fortenberry's chief of staff called up a professor in Nebraska and threatened him for liking this image.\n\nLess than 130 people pressed \u201clike\u201d on a Facebook photo of a defaced campaign sign depicting Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.) with googly eyes alongside a schoolyard reimagining of his name: Jeff Fartenberry.\n\nThe post wasn\u2019t threatening, nor was the sign itself worth much more than a polite guffaw. But if \u201cFartenberry\u201d was juvenile, then Fortenberry\u2019s response to the post was downright fetal.\n\nThe sign was enough of a problem for the congressman\u2019s office that his chief of staff personally reached out to and then threatened one person who pressed \u201clike\u201d on the Facebook post depicting it.\n\nThat person is Ari Kohen, an associate professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. As the Lincoln Journal Star reports, a Fortenberry campaign staffer took a screenshot of Kohen\u2019s dastardly Facebook like last Thursday, then notified the congressman\u2019s D.C. campaign office (and also, apparently, Kohen\u2019s employers).\n\nThe next day, Kohen received a call from Fortenberry\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nIn a recording of the call later posted to YouTube, Dr. William \u201cReyn\u201d Archer III can be heard scolding Kohen for liking the post.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re liking is vandalism,\u201d Archer says.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Kohen responds. \u201cYour argument is that anything I like on Facebook represents an endorsement by me of the thing \u2015 not the post, but the thing \u2015 that is happening in the world?\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d Archer says.\n\nKohen sounds perplexed. He asks why a sitting congressman is focusing his ire on a Facebook photo and why his office felt it necessary to report the act to Kohen\u2019s \u201cimmediate supervisor, dean and chancellor of the university.\u201d (The university confirmed to HuffPost that Archer reached out to all three via email.)\n\nArcher goes on to threaten that he might make the whole thing public:\n\n\u201cWe have a First Amendment opportunity to put you out there in front of everybody,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can do that publicly. Would you like that? That\u2019s our First Amendment right.\u201d\n\nBut I recorded our entire 53 minute conversation and you can listen to his specific threat and the few minutes that preceded it right here: https://t.co/mIEN2GDBOA \u2014 Ari Kohen (@kohenari) November 1, 2018\n\nThis week, Kohen decided to make the whole thing public on his own terms. He filed a report against Archer with the Office of Congressional Ethics on Monday and told his side of the story on Twitter on Thursday.\n\nArcher and Fortenberry know perfectly well that I don\u2019t \u201clike vandalism.\u201d But they wanted to intimidate me, with both the power of their office and with a specific threat to unleash a mob against me. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve filed a report with the Office of Congressional Ethics. \u2014 Ari Kohen (@kohenari) November 1, 2018\n\nKohen told HuffPost he\u2019s not sure what Fortenberry\u2019s office expected him to do after the call to rectify his egregious post-liking. But he does think they had an endgame in mind.\n\n\u201cHis intention was to violate my First Amendment rights; to have a chilling effect on faculty speech. That\u2019s obviously hugely problematic by itself, and then he threatened me,\u201d Kohen told HuffPost by phone. \u201cIf you listen to the recording, it\u2019s very clear. It\u2019s worded as a threat, and the way he says it, it comes off as aggressive.\u201d\n\nKohen added that he never would have escalated this minor issue into a major one had it not been for the threat. Online threats have had real-world implications, and Kohen\u2019s colleagues have received death threats in the past, he said.\n\n\u201cIf there wasn\u2019t this whole attempt to intimidate and threaten, if there wasn\u2019t a shooting at a synagogue the day after they called me, I wouldn\u2019t have thought anything about it,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the past, such efforts have directly resulted in weeks of threatening letters, voicemails, and email messages to faculty members who found themselves publicly called out in this way (including several of my colleagues at UNL). These have included death threats. \u2014 Ari Kohen (@kohenari) November 1, 2018\n\nIn an interview with the Lincoln Journal Star, Archer denied threatening Kohen and doubled down on the apparent criminal nature of the professor\u2019s Facebook like.\n\n\u201cHe saw it as humorous; we saw it as a slippery slope to liking vandalism,\u201d Archer said.\n\nThere\u2019s no indication that Archer contacted anyone else who liked the post. In the phone call audio, Kohen repeatedly asks why he alone was targeted, and Archer answers that it\u2019s because he\u2019s a professor.\n\nIn an email to HuffPost on Thursday, Archer said the audio Kohen released only represented a small portion of their full conversation.\n\n\u201cIn his Twitter post, the professor appears to have redacted large parts of our conversation, since it was 45 minutes long,\u201d Archer wrote. \u201d[Kohen] followed up with a lengthy thank you note from him looking forward to future opportunities for dialogue and mutual collaboration.\u201d\n\nNumerous other questions HuffPost sent to Archer went unanswered.\n\nKohen said he did indeed send a thank you email and \u201calso asked why people in positions of authority are using that authority to try and intimidate people.\u201d He said he plans to release the full audio of the conversation soon.\n\nSmear campaigns over polarizing social media posts have been a permanent feature of the current political landscape, but the right has been particularly successful in getting opponents \u2015 big and small \u2015 fired or otherwise disparaged for their past social media activity.\n\nLate last year, MSNBC fired and then rehired its contributor Sam Seder after Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich surfaced an off-color Roman Polanski joke he\u2019d tweeted almost a decade prior. Right-wing trolls also went after journalist Sarah Jeong, surfacing old tweets of hers after she joined The New York Times editorial board.", "There\u2019s something beautiful about an upbeat dance anthem that speaks to heartbreak. It taps into a certain impulse that comes with despair, directing a metaphorical middle finger at a former love interest, taking ownership of being on your own as something joyful instead of bleak.\n\nThe most obvious example of this is Robyn\u2019s instantly iconic \u201cDancing On My Own,\u201d in which she describes watching from a corner as her former flame kiss someone else. She\u2019s still very affected by the breakup \u2015 \u201cI\u2019m right over here, why can\u2019t you see me?\u201d she wonders in the chorus. But she keeps dancing. It\u2019s a message that there\u2019s value in remaining upright when circumstances seem to call for collapsing in a heap, that the upsetting situation in itself is worthy of a hip shake.\n\nOf course, Robyn didn\u2019t invent the empowering breakup bop. Her song is one in a well-established genre, defined by bangers from the likes of Gloria Gaynor, Whitney Houston, Cher, Kelly Clarkson, Beyonc\u00e9, and others.\n\nAnd, of course, Carly Rae Jepsen.\n\nJepsen staked her claim to pop\u2019s landscape with \u201cCall Me Maybe,\u201d a 2012 hit about hopeful crushing. But since then, she\u2019s contributed several additions to the canon of parting psalms.\n\nOn her 2015 album \u201cEmotion\u201d alone, there was the giddy \u201cBoy Problems\u201d and the slower-building revelation of \u201cYour Type.\u201d On \u201cEmotion: Side B,\u201d her 2016 follow-up, she added \u201cFirst Time\u201d and \u201cFever,\u201d the latter\u2019s chorus throughly owning rejection in an epic shrug: \u201cYou wanna break my heart, all right.\u201d All four would be at home on any dance playlist, even as they tread the ground of heartache.\n\nJoining this tradition is her most recent single, \u201cParty for One,\u201d released Thursday. In its opening lyrics, the song doesn\u2019t feel as immediately innovative or exciting as the tracks off \u201cEmotion\u201d and \u201cSide B.\u201d There\u2019s hardly a verse, and what\u2019s there isn\u2019t terribly specific: \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know that you were right for me / Then there\u2019s nothing I can say / Try to call you up to spend some time to see / But somebody\u2019s in your way.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all in the service of the crown jewel, though \u2015 the chorus, an earworm of self-love:\n\nParty for one\n\nIf you don\u2019t care about me\n\nI\u2019ll just dance for myself\n\nBack on my beat\n\nThe lines repeat so often that it sounds as though the singer is convincing herself of the message as the song drums on. At first, she\u2019d like to feel empowered, and then she actually does. As I listened more, the lack of specific storytelling seemed a justifiable casualty in the name of boppy universality. If you\u2019d never heard \u201cParty for One\u201d before and it came on in the club, you\u2019d know it inside and out by the end.\n\nWhat does it mean to be back on your beat? Where were you when you weren\u2019t on this beat? Who knows what the words mean, but it feels good to move to them.\n\nAt the beginning of the \u201cParty for One\u201d video, Jepsen appears alone, checking into a dingy hotel and stripping down to a pair of Calvin Klein tighty whities. Commence blas\u00e9 channel-flipping, mirror-staring, bed-flopping. But it turns out she\u2019s not the only solo traveler in the hotel who\u2019s seeking out some form of joy amid uncertainty, whether it\u2019s via a mini dance party, a new haircut or new sex toys. A power outage brings the motley crew to the lobby.\n\nWhen the lights come back on, they rejoice, drinking Absolut Vodka-sponsored cocktails and briefly sharing a moment of connection before sequestering themselves in their rooms once again.\n\nThe video straddles the trickiness of self-love: You want other people to know exactly how you feel, but ultimately, it\u2019s a singular experience. Connection with your fellow human beings is exhilarating, but brief and unreliable. Even the title suggests a closed-door fete for no one\u2019s attendance or approval but your own. Even a \u201cParty of One,\u201d which I kept mistakenly calling the single, would be a different experience, a performative solo outing among a larger group.", "A police officer and a former narcotics detective with the Springfield Police Department in Massachusetts are facing federal charges for allegedly beating and spitting on two Latino teens during an arrest in 2016.\n\nOfficer Gregg A.

It\u2019s not a political statement. Spokeswoman for Higher Ground Productions\n\nA spokesman for Netflix declined to comment on the possible project.\n\nEarlier this year, a source familiar with the production deal told HuffPost that their first projects \u2014 which could include a variety of movies and series, from children\u2019s programming to documentaries \u2014 would not appear on the streaming site until late 2019 at the earliest.\n\nThe Obamas have kept busy in recent months, working on various policy initiatives. Later this month, the former first lady is set to publish a memoir, Becoming, before embarking on a multicity book tour in stadium venues.\n\nOver the last few weeks, she has also hit the campaign trail promoting her voter registration effort, urging voters to get to the polls for next Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nThe former president, still perhaps Democrats\u2019 best surrogate on the campaign trail, has stumped for some of the party\u2019s midterm candidates.

Abrams would also become the nation\u2019s first black female governor.\n\nWhile sporadically speaking out against Trump\u2019s policies when they directly affected his presidential legacy, Obama in recent months has more forcefully denounced Trump during public appearances.", "In an apparent effort to use anti-immigrant sentiment as a get-out-the-vote tool, President Donald Trump said Thursday that his administration is finalizing a plan to deny asylum to migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally \u2015 a move that would be sure to draw legal challenges should it come to fruition.\n\nTrump has been escalating his already aggressive attacks on undocumented immigrants ahead of the Nov. 6 midterm elections. Just this week, he announced plans to send at least 5,200 active-duty troops \u2015 and possibly as many as 15,000 \u2015 to the U.S.-Mexico border to address migrant caravans, threatened to indefinitely detain asylum-seekers in \u201ctent cities\u201d and floated the idea of ending birthright citizenship by executive order.\n\nHe said Thursday that he would issue an executive order \u201csometime next week\u201d that would be \u201cquite comprehensive.\u201d He said the plan would shut down access to asylum for people who seek safety in the United States unless they go to legal ports of entry. By law, immigrants can seek asylum either at ports of entry or once in the U.S. \u2015 even if they crossed illegally.\n\nTrump insisted his plan to restrict asylum would be \u201ctotally legal.\u201d He repeated his vow to indefinitely lock up asylum-seekers while they pursue immigration claims, and claimed that \u201calmost everybody\u201d is abusing the system rather than pursuing legitimate efforts.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of tents,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have a lot of everything. We\u2019re holding them right there. We\u2019re not letting them into our country.\u201d\n\nImmigrant rights groups are expected to challenge any limits placed on access to asylum.\n\nTrump and administration officials argued the moves are a necessary response to a migrant caravan slowly making its way to the U.S.-Mexico border from Honduras. The caravan, once estimated at more than 7,000 people, is now down to about 3,500 asylum-seekers and other migrants and is still hundreds of miles from the border. A second caravan of about 3,000 migrants is also traveling to the U.S., followed by at least two smaller groups.\n\nThe caravan is \u201clike an invasion,\u201d Trump said Thursday, claiming that many of the members are men \u201cwe don\u2019t want in our country.\u201d He said he told the armed troops deployed to the border that they could open fire if migrants throw rocks at them, something Border Patrol agents have done in the past.\n\nTrump repeatedly blamed Democrats and the courts for the caravan and other unauthorized immigration.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions and statements come days after a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 people dead. The suspect in that case, Robert Bowers, reportedly posted anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant comments on social media, claiming Jews were helping a migrant caravan that he likened to \u201cinvaders.\u201d (Conspiracy theorists have accused liberal billionaire George Soros, who is Jewish and who was recently targeted by a mail bomber, of funding the caravan, without evidence. Trump said Wednesday that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d if the conspiracy theory were true.)\n\nAssociated Press President Donald Trump launched his campaign with an attack on immigrants and hasn't stopped since.\n\nAlthough Trump has claimed that unauthorized immigration is a \u201ccrisis,\u201d apprehension numbers by Border Patrol are far from their record rate of 1.6 million in 2000. Last year, Border Patrol arrested about 400,000 people at the border \u2015 more than the year before, but in line with other recent years. Asylum-seekers are encouraged to go to ports of entry to legally seek asylum, but misinformation and increasingly long wait times lead to some crossing the border and asking for help afterward instead.\n\nSince 2014, Central American families and unaccompanied children, often seeking asylum, have made up a greater proportion of all apprehensions than in the past, making swift deportations more complicated.\n\nThat\u2019s because asylum-seekers, along with unaccompanied children from countries other than Mexico and Canada, have special protections enshrined in law, based on the principle that vulnerable individuals should have a chance to have their claims heard before they are shipped back to potential danger. Because of court backlogs, some cases take years to complete, and limits on indefinite detention of children result in many families being released in the meantime.\n\nBut administration officials claim that many asylum-seekers are exploiting \u201cloopholes\u201d in the law to gain entry to the U.S. Trump insisted that asylum-seekers are reading off a prepared script when they claim they would face danger back home.\n\n\u201cAsylum is not a program for people living in poverty,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAsylum is a very special protection.\u201d\n\nU.S. law and international law protect asylum-seekers from deportation if they could suffer at home, making the potential policy change vulnerable to a legal challenge. Plus, Trump\u2019s past statements on migrants could lead to claims that he was motivated by racial animus, which came up in past lawsuits against his immigration policies.\n\nThe Trump administration has already taken other, less high-profile steps to restrict asylum. Attorney General Jeff Sessions unilaterally changed policy in June, under his authority overseeing immigration courts, by ruling that generally migrants cannot gain asylum based on victimhood by gangs and domestic violence. Only about one-third of asylum claims were approved in the 2018 fiscal year, the lowest rate in nearly 20 years, BuzzFeed News reported on Monday.", "Any chance for Shangela to reclaim her rightful crown is a welcome one, so bring on a holiday-themed \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d special just in time for Christmas.\n\nThe \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race Holi-slay Spectacular\u201d will see the return of eight contestants from past seasons, including Eureka O\u2019Hara, Jasmine Masters, Kim Chi, Latrice Royale, Mayhem Miller, Shangela, Sonique, and Trixie Mattel.

Kit Harington apparently cried twice during the table read.\n\nFinally, there are the light spoilers. We learn a bit about the giant battle with the Army of the Dead to come, which filmed for weeks and is \u201cexpected to be the most sustained action sequence ever made for television or film.\u201d\n\nAnd here\u2019s what we can expect from the Season 8 opener at the Stark home of Winterfell:\n\nSeason 8 opens at Winterfell with an episode that contains plenty of callbacks to the show\u2019s pilot. Instead of King Robert\u2019s procession arriving, it\u2019s Daenerys and her army. What follows is a thrilling and tense intermingling of characters \u2014 some of whom have never previously met, many who have messy histories \u2014 as they all prepare to face the inevitable invasion of the Army of the Dead.\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely new information. Clips of the cast bemoaning the end of \u201cGoT\u201d were already out there when EW released the story online (it\u2019ll be available in magazine form Friday), and we knew about the first Winterfell scenes from previous leaks.\n\nThe most enlightening bit in the EW story comes from an anecdote from reporter James Hibberd\u2019s trip to the set ahead of the Season 8 finale shoot, which is said to have included some unlikely characters:\n\nSeveral actors are performing, and I\u2019m stunned: There are characters in the finale that I did not expect. I gradually begin to piece together what has happened in Westeros over the previous five episodes and try not to look like I\u2019m freaking out.\n\nSnow my God. Who could these mysterious surprise characters be? A couple possibilities come to mind:\n\nHowland Reed\n\nHowland is the man to the left of young Ned Stark in the GIF above. He was the only other person besides Ned who survived the battle at the Tower of Joy, where Lyanna Stark gave birth to Jon Snow/Aegon Targaryen, aka the birthplace of the biggest secret on the show.\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen Howland on the show, other than in a Tower of Joy flashback/vision from Bran. But if he\u2019s showing up in the finale, it could have something to do with confirming Jon Snow\u2019s Targaryen heritage.\n\nPlus, there\u2019s his daughter, Meera Reed, still running around out there. In the books, it seems like she could be a love interest for Bran, so perhaps she\u2019ll return to the spotlight with her dad.\n\nNed Stark\n\nWhen Hibberd wrote that he was not expecting certain characters to appear in the finale, he might\u2019ve been hinting at something: we\u2019ve seen these characters before. And maybe he didn\u2019t expect them because they\u2019re supposedly dead.\n\nWe already know from casting director Nina Gold that Sean Bean was so important to the show that the northern accents we hear to this day are modeled after his voice. Even though Ned died in Season 1, he\u2019s constantly brought up in dialogue, including multiple times in Season 7. For example, between Sansa and Arya in the season finale:\n\nEarlier this year, I asked Bean about rumors of his possible return to the show, and at the time he told me, \u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors, but not from very good sources, that I might be back. But I think I\u2019ve done my time there, and I created a good character.\u201d\n\nThe actor continued, telling me it\u2019d be \u201cstrange\u201d to see his character resurrected. But this is the final season, so let\u2019s get strange.\n\nMaybe Ned will simply appear in a flashback. Or a vision. As a Force ghost? Who knows?\n\nLady Stoneheart\n\nThis is more wishful thinking, but we\u2019ve already predicted the return of dead Ned, so why stop there?

In a Christian Broadcasting Network interview released Nov. 1, he said, \u201cNobody\u2019s done more for Christians or evangelicals or, frankly, religion than I have.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump is supremely confident that evangelical Christians, who have consistently been among his most loyal supporters, will continue to show up for him during the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nWith his characteristic sweeping bravado, Trump told a Christian news station that because of everything he has done for America\u2019s religious groups, he\u2019s certain evangelicals will come through for him, even though he\u2019s not on the ballot next Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to show up for me because nobody\u2019s done more for Christians or evangelicals or, frankly, religion than I have,\u201d he said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network published on Thursday.\n\nTrump suggested this support stems from how his administration has \u201cnullified\u201d the Johnson Amendment, a provision in the U.S. tax code that forbids faith groups from endorsing or opposing political candidates. In fact, both progressive and conservative groups agreed that his executive order targeting the amendment in May 2017 had little impact on religious leaders\u2019 ability to engage in political campaigns.\n\nHe also referred to his expansion of the Mexico City policy, which withholds U.S. aid from foreign nongovernmental health organizations that offer women advice about abortion. In practice, the new policy has placed tighter restrictions on a wide swath of health organizations and applies to about 15 times the amount of foreign aid previously affected.\n\nThe president told CBN that he believes these things are wins for evangelicals.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s done more than we have. Mexico City \u2014 take a look at that. Things that, frankly, until Ronald Reagan, nobody did anything,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo I know they\u2019re very happy with me. We\u2019ve seen they\u2019re very happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is whether or not they\u2019re going to go out and vote when I\u2019m not running,\u201d he added. \u201cI have no doubt they\u2019re going to be there in \u201920. I hope they\u2019re going to be there now, because it\u2019ll be a lot easier if they are, a lot better.\u201d\n\nWatch CBN\u2019s interview with Trump below.\n\nAlthough Trump said he\u2019s positive that his policies have been beneficial to all Americans, his approval ratings tell another story. According to a Public Religion Research Institute survey published Monday, majorities of most American religious groups have an unfavorable opinion of the president. The vast majority of black Protestants (80 percent), religiously unaffiliated Americans (75 percent), Hispanic Catholics (74 percent) and non-Christian religious Americans (73 percent) surveyed said they have negative opinions about Trump. Slim majorities of white mainline Protestants and white Catholics (both 52 percent) also said they are not fans of the president.\n\nIn fact, the only religious group that had a majority of respondents voicing a favorable opinion of Trump was white evangelical Protestants, with 68 percent of them saying they have a favorable view of Trump, including 28 percent with a very favorable opinion of the president.\n\nBrian McLaren, a progressive Christian author and speaker, told HuffPost in an email that Trump\u2019s claim to be for all Americans is \u201claughable.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is happy to throw LGBTQ people under the bus, women under the bus, Jews and Muslims under the bus, as long as it accrues to his political power and increasing wealth,\u201d said McLaren, who grew up evangelical but now attends an Episcopal congregation. \u201cEven more sadly, conservative Evangelical and Catholic leaders are showing themselves to be becoming more like their leader.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere seems to be no limit to the harm they are willing to inflict in order to advance their narrowing agenda that now is reduced to outlawing abortion, stigmatizing LGBTQ people, and expanding their religious freedom at the expense of the religious freedom of others,\u201d he added.\n\nPeople of faith can count on Trump to defend them as long as they don\u2019t criticize him, McLaren said. But the author cautioned that there\u2019s a price to pay for this special treatment.", "Geraldo Rivera is apologizing for being a \u201cright-wing lunatic\u201d during last week\u2019s mail bomb scare.\n\nOn Thursday\u2019s episode of \u201cThe View,\u201d Rivera walked back an allegation he made during an Oct. 25 appearance on Fox Business Network that the bombs sent to CNN and prominent Democrats were actually an \u201celaborate hoax ... intended to further divide the American people.\u201d\n\nDuring the original interview, Rivera alleged the person behind the mail bombs was \u201csomeone who wanted to embarrass President Trump, somebody who wanted to affect American political life.\u201d\n\nOnce Cesar Sayoc was arrested, Rivera apologized for the wrongheaded theory, but he still had to explain himself to the women on \u201cThe View.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I was a right-wing lunatic right then,\u201d he said sheepishly. \u201cI apologized for it.

But she was taken aback at school orientation in the summer of 2015, when she learned that the charter school\u2019s dress code prohibits girls from wearing pants or shorts as part of its standard uniform.\n\nHer daughter dislikes wearing skirts and dresses, Peltier told HuffPost. And Peltier didn\u2019t understand why she\u2019d have to force her child to wear clothes that make it harder to play freely, and are less warm when the weather gets chilly.\n\nTo understand the school\u2019s reasoning, Peltier emailed its founder, Baker Mitchell, a conservative entrepreneur who owns a company that manages four public charter schools in the state.\n\nIn his reply, Mitchell said the dress code was about \u201cchivalry\u201d and claimed it helped instill traditional values, making for better manners and better-behaved children. A fairly standard response, at the outset. But then, he suggested that the dress code could help prevent school shootings.\n\nPeltier was shocked.\n\nThe email kicked off a years-long battle with Charter Day that has yet to be resolved. All this time, Peltier\u2019s daughter has been dutifully wearing her school uniform.\n\nCharter Day is the best public school in the area, Peltier said. She didn\u2019t see why her daughter should be denied the opportunity for a good education. \u201cI figured if I have to get the policy changed, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d she said. \u201cShe belongs there; the teachers are wonderful; her friends are there.\u201d\n\nWith the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, Peltier and two other mothers sued Charter Day in federal court in 2016 on behalf of their daughters. Their aim is simply to give girls at the school the option to wear pants or shorts. They argue that the restrictive dress code discriminates against girls and violates Title IX, the part of the federal civil rights law that covers public education.\n\n\u201cThey get public money. And they need to abide by the law,\u201d said Erika Booth, a 47-year-old paramedic who joined the suit on behalf of her daughter. \u201cThey need to go ahead and treat girls equally. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d\n\nDress codes in the U.S. have been increasingly subject to controversy for various reasons, but HuffPost only recently learned about the Charter Day case, which hasn\u2019t garnered much national attention. A ruling could come soon on the school\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\n\nLawyers for Charter Day declined to comment for this story, instead referring HuffPost to the arguments the school made in its motion for summary judgment last year. There, the school said the uniform dress code is part of its \u201ctraditional values\u201d framework, and noted that it\u2019s legal to have differing dress requirements for boys and girls. The policy fosters classroom discipline and \u201cmutual respect between boys and girls,\u201d the school argued, pointing out that parents choose the school.\n\nFurther, the school said the policy doesn\u2019t adversely impact girls, who outscore boys at the school in standardized math tests.\n\nCharter Day also claimed it would hurt the school to get rid of a policy that parents like. But it\u2019s not clear parents are so fond of the code, Peltier and Booth told HuffPost. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of support,\u201d Booth said.\n\nA petition to change the dress code garnered more than 100 signatures, according to a 2016 blog post from a student on the ACLU\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cWhen we go outside for recess, the boys in my class will sometimes play soccer or do flips and cartwheels,\u201d wrote Keely Burks, who was an eighth-grader at the school. \u201cBut I feel like I can\u2019t because I\u2019m wearing a skirt.\u201d\n\nShe said she\u2019d been put in a timeout in the first grade because she sat with her legs criss-crossed, rather than curled to the side as was expected of girls.\n\nIn its arguments to the court, Charter Day does not touch on the reasoning Mitchell offered Peltier in his email in 2015, possibly because it is so outrageous. In that email, Mitchell linked the dress code to the Columbine school shooting, which he pointed out happened the year before Charter Day\u2019s founding. He told Peltier that some of the victims were female.\n\nIn the wake of Columbine, where two high school boys killed 12 of their classmates, one teacher and themselves, Charter Day\u2019s founders were \u201cdetermined to preserve chivalry and respect among young women and men in this school of choice,\u201d Mitchell wrote to Peltier. Young men should hold doors open for young ladies and even carry umbrellas for them, he said. Students should say \u201cma\u2019am\u201d and \u201csir\u201d when addressing adults.\n\nAnd today, when bullying and harassment are big issues, as well as teen pregnancy and casual sex, Mitchell said, the dress codes are just important.\n\nThe argument essentially seemed to be that dressing nicely and behaving politely will somehow prevent school violence and other social ills.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t really be saying that Columbine wouldn\u2019t have happened if girls wore skirts, Peltier thought while reading his email. \u201cBut that was what he was saying,\u201d she told HuffPost.\n\nIn the court documents, Charter Day distanced itself from Mitchell\u2019s email, saying it wasn\u2019t an \u201cofficial pronouncement.\u201d\n\nMitchell and the school both emphasized that the dress code encourages a culture of respect, but Peltier and Booth say the unequal policy is actually disrespectful to girls, who are treated as the fairer, and thus less capable, sex \u2015 outdated tropes that perpetuate sexism.\n\n\u201cI think it teaches girls they\u2019re second-class citizens. They take second place to the boys. And it\u2019s not right,\u201d Booth said. \u201cMy daughter has aspirations to do things that are traditionally men\u2019s jobs. She wants to be a soldier. I\u2019ve never seen a soldier in a skirt.\u201d\n\nThis Charter Day eighth-grader, identified in the suit as \"I.B.,\" would just rather wear pants or shorts to school.\n\nIf schools are really concerned with fostering a culture of respect, they should make sure that students are comfortable, welcome, safe and happy in their learning environment, said Adaku Onyeka-Crawford, senior counsel for education at the National Women\u2019s Law Center.\n\nBut gendered dress codes don\u2019t actually work toward those goals. Skirts and dresses are indeed less comfortable, it\u2019s harder to play when ensconced in fabric past your knees, and in the winter months, girls are colder.\n\nDress codes also can work against the notion of respect \u2015 particularly for girls, who are treated more like fragile, sexualized objects than autonomous human beings. \u201cThere tend to be more rules for girls than boys,\u201d Onyeka-Crawford said. \u201cIt tends to be another way to police girls\u2019 bodies.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no nationwide data on the use of gendered dress codes in schools, but they\u2019re not uncommon. Schools often mandate the length of girls\u2019 skirts or prohibit certain kinds of tops \u2015 spaghetti straps, for example. Meanwhile, boys are allowed to get away with a bit more \u2015 say, playing basketball shirtless.\n\nOver the past year, these prohibitions have been called out for sexualizing, stereotyping and harming young women. Black girls, in particular, are often burdened by dress codes, which can ban styles specific to their cultures, such as certain hairstyles.\n\nGendered dress codes also help reinforce damaging stereotypes about boys and girls. Girls at the Charter Day school have been told to \u201csit like a princess\u201d or \u201csit like a girl\u201d in the classroom, and have been reprimanded for turning cartwheels on the playground (and inadvertently showing their underpants), according to the lawsuit.", "Madea\u2019s film farewell promises to be so raucous it could raise the dead.\n\nA few days after Tyler Perry announced he was retiring his feisty grandma alter ego, a trailer for her last movie dropped.\n\n\u201cTyler Perry\u2019s A Madea Family Funeral\u201d features Madea unexpectedly coordinating a funeral that could \u201creveal sordid family secrets,\u201d according to Lionsgate.\n\nThe clip shows her definitely in charge. \u201cI knows about funerals,\u201d she declares. \u201cI done buried a lot of men.

After friends didn\u2019t recognize whom she\u2019d dressed up as for Halloween, Kardashian West called them \u201cretarded\u201d in her Instagram Stories on Wednesday.\n\nThe KarJenner brood was gathered to celebrate the holiday and Kendall Jenner\u2019s 23rd birthday as a family. Predictably, every sister committed and then some to her looks \u2015 Kylie Jenner sported at least four different costumes over the weekend \u2015 but Kim was seemingly less than thrilled with the way her outfit was received.\n\nKardashian West recreated Pamela Anderson\u2019s red carpet look at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards, with best friend Jonathan Cheban dressed as Tommy Lee.\n\nBut the younger crowd wasn\u2019t too familiar with the reference, which prompted Kardashian West to document everyone\u2019s reactions on Instagram, as one millennial after the next failed the test.\n\n\u201cNobody knows who I am,\u201d Kim told her former assistant and definitely not current nemesis Stephanie Shepherd. \u201cYeah!

ECU, which worked to elect Democratic candidates who support campaign finance reform, used aggressive and expansive email campaigns to rake in millions of dollars in online donations. The PAC\u2019s pushy tactics angered other nonprofits working toward campaign finance reform, which came to think of the PAC as an arm of the Democratic Party stealing their donors with deceptive email marketing.\n\nUntil this spring, HuffPost\u2019s story was the second to come up in a generic Google search for \u201cEnd Citizens United.\u201d But in the spring of 2018, an anonymous U.S.-based contractor paid at least 3,800 workers in countries around the world through the crowdsourcing firm Microworkers to manipulate what stories would come up when people searched for the PAC in Google, according to public job listings on Microworkers reviewed by HuffPost. The contractor paid each of the workers 20 cents to click on stories and sites that portrayed the PAC positively, bumping those stories up in Google at the expense of critical coverage. HuffPost\u2019s story dropped from the second place on the first page of the Google search to the second page of search results.\n\nEnd Citizens United did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment before publication.\n\nAlexander Thorburn Winsor A sampling of job listings on the Microworkers site.\n\nAlthough microjob campaigns to influence search engine results for product reviews are somewhat common, it\u2019s unusual to see one targeting news coverage, explained James Caverlee, an associate professor at Texas A&M University.\n\nEnd Citizens United has never disclosed a payment to Microworkers or any other microwork platform. It probably doesn\u2019t have to. If the PAC is behind the effort to downgrade negative search results, it likely hid the payment as an expense made through a contractor to a subvendor.\n\nAlexander Thorburn Winsor An example of the job listings on Microworkers (with personally identifiable information redacted).\n\nThe lack of disclosure of subvendors is rampant in digital political consulting, and allowed by the Federal Election Commission. In fact, disclosures for digital spending are, \u201calmost worthless,\u201d according to the magazine Campaigns & Elections.\n\nCampaigns usually report paying consulting firms without further explanation for what that money was actually spent on. The consulting firm can then spend that money to advertise on Facebook, Google or Twitter, pay design and production firms or, potentially, pay microwork sites to manipulate search results.\n\nAlexander Thorburn Winsor\n\nHowever, there are several recent cases that have brought criticism of that system to the forefront.\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign paid the research firm Fusion GPS to hire ex-British spy Christopher Steele to collect information on Donald Trump\u2019s alleged ties to Russia, it did not report the payment. Instead, the payment was routed through Perkins Coie, the Clinton campaign\u2019s law firm, and described solely as \u201clegal services.\u201d This payment has been challenged in a complaint by the Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog nonprofit group.\n\nA federal appeals court in May upheld the convictions of three former Ron Paul presidential campaign operatives for illegally concealing a payment for an important endorsement from a state senator as a subvendor expense in the Paul campaign\u2019s expenditure report. The campaign paid Kent Sorensen, an Iowa state senator, for his endorsement by treating him as a subvendor for the audiovisual contractor listed in the campaign\u2019s disclosures. Sorensen and two Paul campaign aides were convicted of using a false description in the campaign\u2019s disclosure reports.\n\nAlthough the court that upheld the Paul operatives\u2019 convictions frowned on the FEC\u2019s unclear rules for when it\u2019s permissible to not disclose subvendor payments, the FEC has not enacted any new guidance on this question, allowing campaigns and PACs to keep subvendor payments under wraps for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhoever paid for the campaign to manipulate ECU search results could have hidden their activities by recruiting workers through a private group on an online platform or by organizing the campaign offline, rather than a public platform like Microworkers.", "Even with two falls, gymnastics star Simone Biles could not be beaten.\n\nThe U.S. athlete won her fourth all-around title at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Doha, Qatar, on Thursday, besting her competition despite falls on the vault and balance beam.\n\nThe 21-year-old could afford a few missteps thanks to the high degree of difficulty in her routines.

Despite Kansas\u2019 reputation as a deep-red state, political observers say the close race is unsurprising, noting negative views of the controversial Kobach and the unpopularity of Republican Sam Brownback, who resigned as governor in January. The state also has a history of electing Democratic governors, the latest being Kathleen Sebelius, who led the state from 2003 until 2009.\n\nPolls predicted a tight race between Kobach and Kelly even before he narrowly won the Republican gubernatorial primary. Those polls have stayed remarkably consistent throughout the campaign for the general election, even though the president, Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr. have traveled to the state to support Kobach.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats Sharice Davids and Paul Davis have solid chances to win the state\u2019s 3rd and 2nd Congressional Districts, respectively. In the 3rd, which includes Kansas City and upper-middle-class suburbs, Davids is thought to have an edge on GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder. Davis, who narrowly lost the gubernatorial race to Brownback in 2014, is battling veteran and business owner Steve Watkins in the 2nd, which includes most of eastern Kansas, including Topeka and a swath of rural areas.\n\nBob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, said that polling showed the closest governor\u2019s race in modern Kansas history. He said the tight contest was shaped by strong Kelly fundraising, negative views of Kobach and the lingering unpopularity of Brownback, who was one of the least popular governors in the country when he left office to become the U.S. ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a two-lane campaign, and often those two lanes merge into one lane. The two lanes are controversy over Kris Kobach, and then the second lane is Sam Brownback. And what Kelly is trying to do ... in every possible permutation of TV ad, make those lanes merge, [saying] Kobach is Brownback.\u201d\n\nPolling shows a large percentage of voters have unfavorable views of Kobach, known nationally for his staunch anti-immigration views and backing perhaps the most restrictive voting law in the country. With the exception of Brownback, every living former Kansas governor, including two Republicans, have endorsed Kelly. The state\u2019s GOP former Sen. Nancy Kassebaum has also endorsed Kelly.\n\nKelly has outraised Kobach, whose campaign is largely being funded by his pick for lieutenant governor. Beatty said her strong fundraising was significant because it allowed her to show voters she was a possible alternative to Kobach.\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats don\u2019t have the money to show them that the Democrat is acceptable, the default goes to the Republican. What she\u2019s done well is raise money to at least allow people to see that she\u2019s an acceptable alternative,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of times in Kansas, there may be an acceptable alternative for the Democrats, but no one knows who they are.\u201d\n\nAs governor, Brownback oversaw drastic tax cuts in the state, but the results were so catastrophic for the state that Republican lawmakers voted to overturn them. The tax cuts are a central dispute in the campaign; Kobach says he wants to implement the tax cut again while cutting spending, which Kelly says would be a disaster. He accuses her of wanting to raise taxes. They have also sparred over education funding: Kobach is critical of a state Supreme Court decision ordering more education funding and says he wants to change the way officials spend school funds. Kelly supports increasing education funding.\n\nAnti-Brownback feeling is also powering Davis\u2019 and Davids\u2019 campaigns. Before the Kansas City suburbs turned against Trump in 2016, they voted overwhelmingly against Brownback in 2014 because of his education cuts. That trend line is helping Davids, a former MMA fighter and White House fellow who would be one of the first Native American women elected to Congress.\n\nDavis was the Democratic nominee against Brownback in 2014. While he narrowly lost that contest, the moderate Democrat\u2019s residual name identification has helped him campaign and raise money in the district. He has also been aided by a series of scandals enveloping Watkins, including an accusation of sexual misconduct and a revelation that he embellished his role in building a business after leaving the military.\n\nThe governor\u2019s race is complicated by the presence of a third candidate, Greg Orman, a wealthy businessman running as an independent who served as the de facto Democratic Senate candidate in 2014 against GOP Sen. Pat Roberts. Orman is polling around 10 percent and is believed to be pulling more votes from Kelly than Kobach. While national Democrats were hopeful he would drop out after failing to catch on with voters, his continued presence in the contest could swing the race to Kobach.\n\nBecause the opposition is split, Kobach can win if he drives up turnout among his conservative base. He is close with President Trump, who reportedly wanted Kobach to lead the Department of Homeland Security and tapped him to lead a controversial panel to investigate voter fraud in the 2016 elections. Trump endorsed Kobach in the primary.\n\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have a divided general, I think it might be dicier for Kobach to embrace Trump. But given that he\u2019s not shooting for 50 percent \u2014 he\u2019s shooting for 40 or 42 \u2014 he can do that freely,\u201d said Patrick Miller, a political science professor at the University of Kansas. \u201cThat being said, there\u2019s been no evidence that any of the Trumps or Pence or Ted Nugent or any of these high-profile characters who have come in \u2014 there\u2019s no evidence they\u2019ve moved the polls for or against him.\u201d\n\nKelly has been a state senator since 2005. During the Democratic primary, she faced criticism for being too close to the NRA and for her 2015 vote to let Kansans carry concealed weapons without a permit. She said she immediately recognized the vote went too far and has voted recently in favor of gun restrictions, including banning guns on college campuses. In September the National Rifle Association endorsed Kobach, who supports loosening gun restrictions.\n\nShe says she would block any new abortion restrictions, while he favors a state amendment clarifying that the Kansas Constitution does not guarantee a right to an abortion. She favors expanding Medicaid in the state, which he opposes.\n\nKansas encountered a similar situation in 2014, when polls shortly before the election predicted that Davis would oust the governor. Brownback won. Beatty said this election feels different. In 2014 the polls didn\u2019t capture a lack of Democratic enthusiasm for Davis.\n\nBurdett Loomis, a political science professor at the University of Kansas, said Kelly had been reluctant to get in the race and was initially much less known than Kobach throughout the state.", "A voter guide mailed to millions of New York City residents falsely states that paroled felons cannot vote in the upcoming midterm elections, the New York City Campaign Finance Board acknowledged Wednesday.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo (D) signed an executive order in April restoring voting rights to anyone convicted of a felony who is out on parole. The guide was mailed in mid-October to registered voters.\n\nOn the second page of the 32-page document, the guide falsely instructs residents they cannot vote if they are on parole for a felony, WNYC reported.\n\nThe board apologized for the mistake in a statement and promptly corrected the information on its website.\n\nMost states strip convicted felons of the right to vote while incarcerated, allowing them to resume voting after completing their sentence. Two states, Maine and Vermont, allow even incarcerated felons to vote, while four states permanently disenfranchise those with felony convictions.

A request for comment was not immediately returned.\n\nThe New York City Campaign Finance Board stated its members are continuing to work with the Center for Law and Social Justice at Medgar Evers College and other organizations to \u201cspeak with parolees directly and inform them about their voting rights.\u201d The effort includes a trip to New York\u2019s infamous Rikers Island prison complex, scheduled Friday, the board said.\n\nFiguring out whether you can vote with a felony conviction is complicated.

Hoffman, University of Michigan/The Conversation\n\nOne of the great challenges of tackling climate change is making it real for people without a scientific background. That\u2019s because the threat it poses can be so hard to see or feel.\n\nIn the wake of Hurricanes Florence and Michael, for example, one may be compelled to ask, \u201cWas that climate change?\u201d Many politicians and activists have indeed claimed that recent powerful storms are a result of climate change, yet it\u2019s a tough sell.\n\nWhat those who want to communicate climate risks need to do is rephrase the question around probabilities, not direct cause and effect. And for that, insurance is the proverbial \u201ccanary in the coal mine,\u201d sensitive to the trends of climate change impacts and the costly risks they impose.\n\nIn other words, where scientists and educators have had limited success in convincing the public and politicians of the urgency of climate change, insurance companies may step into the breach.\n\nSteroids and climate change\n\nAP Photo/Mary Schwalm Dr. Lubchenco uses steroids in baseball to explain how hurricanes result from climate change.\n\nDr. Jane Lubchenco, an environmental scientist who oversaw the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration from 2009 to 2013, offers a clever analogy to convince people of the connection between the destruction wrought by a single hurricane and climate change. It involves steroids and baseball.\n\nHer analogy goes like this. If a baseball player takes steroids, it\u2019s hard to connect one particular home run to his drug use. But if his total number of home runs and batting averages increase dramatically, the connection becomes apparent.\n\n\u201cIn similar fashion, what we are seeing on Earth today is weather on steroids,\u201d Lubchenco explains. \u201cWe are seeing more, longer lasting heat waves, more intense storms, more droughts and more floods. Those patterns are what we expect with climate change.\u201d\n\nAnd those weather patterns come with a cost.\n\nAP Photo/Julio Cortez Flooding due to climate change may make insurance companies wary.\n\nSomeone has to pay for these damages\n\nIn 2017, for example, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and other natural disasters like Mexican earthquakes and California wildfires caused economic losses of US$330 billion, almost double the inflation-adjusted annual average of $170 billion over the prior 10 years.\n\nEstimated costs from Hurricane Florence, which struck the Carolinas in September, range as high as $170 billion, which would make Florence the costliest storm ever to hit the U.S.\n\nMore broadly, total economic losses from wildfires in the U.S. in 2017 \u2013 the third-hottest year on record, behind 2016 and 2015 \u2013 were four times higher than the average of the preceding 16 years and losses from other severe storms were 60 percent higher.\n\nUnfortunately, convincing politicians, business leaders and the public that these costs are the result of increased climate change risk hasn\u2019t been easy, a challenge that has been a major focus of my work for almost 10 years.\n\nIn 2013, I helped convene a series of executive forums to introduce a wide range of business executives to the 30 petabytes \u2013 30,000,000,000,000,000 bytes \u2013 of weather and climate data in the National Climatic Data Center\u2019s possession.\n\nWhile the hope was that they would see the value of such vast amounts of data in managing climate risk, we found limited interest, leaving us to wonder if we were too early and whether our target was too broad.\n\nThis led me and others to realize that we should be more focused on insurance companies, society\u2019s first line of defense in absorbing these costs, making their industry arguably the one most directly affected by climate change.\n\nFor example, the insurance industry paid out a record $135 billion from natural catastrophes in 2017, almost three times higher than the annual average of $49 billion. That\u2019s not to mention the uninsured losses that were also incurred \u2013 uninsured losses from 2012\u2019s Hurricane Sandy were 50 percent of the total $65 billion in losses, a staggering tab picked up by individual citizens and the taxpayer.\n\nInsurers will eventually adjust to this emerging reality. And with it will come changes in our economy, including higher costs that will affect everyone\u2019s pocketbook.\n\nOur ability to drive a car, buy a house, build an office building, run a manufacturing plant and enter into contracts are all supported by insurance. Without it, a great deal of these activities would become more expensive or even stop.\n\nAnd so, as the insurance sector adjusts to factor the growing risks of climate change in coverage and premiums, it will become a powerful lever for pushing society and the economy to become more resilient to the changes that climate change is expected to bring.\n\nA whole new ballgame\n\nWhile reinsurance companies \u2013 which basically insure the insurers \u2013 have been studying increasing climate-related risks for decades, traditional insurance companies with familiar names like State Farm, Travelers and Liberty Mutual haven\u2019t.\n\nThere are two primary reasons for this. The first is that they\u2019ve been able to pass on the most catastrophic or uncertain risks to reinsurers and other investors. The second is that insurers are overconfident that they\u2019ll be able to quickly adjust their policies on a year-to-year basis to manage climate risks. Hence a 2012 study found that only 12 percent of insurance companies had a comprehensive climate change strategy.\n\nThis is starting to change. A 2018 study found that 38 percent of insurance companies now consider climate change to be a core business issue, a figure that will likely continue to grow.\n\nIn August of this year, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, a respected international standard-setting body for the insurance sector, published a report outlining climate risk a strategic threat for the insurance sector. It cautioned against relying on annual adjustments to manage climate risks as physical risks can change suddenly and in \u201cnon-linear ways.\u201d\n\nRecognizing this threat, many insurers are throwing out decades of outdated weather actuarial data and hiring teams of in-house climatologists, computer scientists and statisticians to redesign their risk models.\n\nUltimately they are examining if they need to change their coverage and raise their rates. This is where the impact will be felt, compelling citizens, businesses and governments to perk up and pay attention.\n\nAnd yet it changes\n\nWhen Galileo Galilei upset dominant beliefs in the 16th century by asserting that the Earth revolved around the sun and was forced to recant, he is purported to have replied \u201cEppur si muove,\u201d meaning \u201cand yet it moves.\u201d\n\nToday, although many dispute that the climate is changing, one might offer a similar retort: \u201cAnd yet it changes.\u201d\n\nAs humans persist in our emission of greenhouse gases, the climate continues to change, weather patterns become more unstable, damages due to hurricanes, wildfires, droughts and floods increase, and insurance payouts grow.\n\nIn response, insurances premiums will increase and coverage will decrease. With any luck, that will lead us to build more resiliently, curb our greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately see increased storm severity for what it is: a consequence of climate change.", "Five days ahead of the midterm elections, President Donald Trump\u2019s top economic adviser took to trashing the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cMy view is a federal minimum wage is a terrible idea \u2015 terrible idea,\u201d Larry Kudlow, director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said in an interview with Washington Post Live on Thursday.\n\nThe federal minimum wage has been on the books since the Great Depression to prevent employers from paying exploitative wages. It is currently set at $7.25 per hour, which translates into an annual salary of about $16,000 for a full-time worker. Polls show that voters on both sides of the aisle not only approve of the concept of a minimum wage, they wish Congress and the White House would raise it.\n\nBut the man leading the president\u2019s economic team is no fan. Kudlow noted, correctly, that the cost of living varies widely from state to state, and that \u201cIdaho is different than New York. Alabama is different than Nebraska.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the federal minimum wage doesn\u2019t work for me,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Kudlow did not endorse the idea of states or localities raising their own minimum wages as they see fit, in lieu of a federal mandate. As a supply-sider who doesn\u2019t like regulations to interfere with the labor market, he did the opposite.\n\n\u201cI would argue against state and local [increases],\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cBut that\u2019s up to the states and localities.\u201d\n\nHe said he applauded Amazon for voluntarily hiking its corporate wage floor to $15, but didn\u2019t think employers should be required to pay anything higher than they currently are. \u201cParticularly [with] small businesses, to force them to take a kind of payroll increase would be silly,\u201d Kudlow said.\n\nTo be clear, the federal minimum prevails in any jurisdiction that does not mandate a higher one. As Congress has allowed the federal rate to remain stagnant for nearly a decade, more and more states have opted to raise their own wage floors instead \u2015 including states dominated by Republican legislators. These days, 29 states have a higher wage floor than $7.25.\n\nBut if the federal minimum wage disappeared tomorrow, it would become legal for employers in seven states to pay less than that. In fact, five of those states \u2015 Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and South Carolina \u2015 have no state minimum wage at all, meaning employers could pay as little as the market would allow if not for federal law. (Wyoming and Georgia have state minimum wages but they are set at $5.15.)\n\nKudlow\u2019s remarks serve as a reminder of how far apart the GOP elite is from regular voters on this particular issue. Sen. Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee Republican who heads the committee through which any federal minimum wage hike would go, is on the record saying the wage floor should be abolished.\n\nRepublican voters do not love the minimum wage quite as much as Democrats, but poll after poll shows it enjoys broad support across party lines. Minimum wage referendums have been passing, even in red states, by huge 2-1 margins.", "New details are emerging about the death of notorious mob boss Whitey Bulger on Tuesday after he was transferred to the general population of U.S. Penitentiary Hazelton, one of the most dangerous prisons in America.\n\nBulger \u2015 who ruled Boston\u2019s criminal underground for more than 20 years and stayed on the run for another 16 before his capture \u2015 was reportedly beaten to death within hours of his transfer from a Florida prison to the high-security penitentiary in West Virginia on Tuesday.\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons officials say one of the weapons used to murder him was a lock in a sock.

There\u2019s such a company culture that\u2019s so welcoming and inclusive,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd then to see that not only that happened but that so much money was used to cover it up \u2015 I felt shameful.

It was his second brief appearance in a federal courtroom since the weekend massacre at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh\u2019s Squirrel Hill neighborhood.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d Bowers said in a loud voice when asked if he understood the charges.\n\nAuthorities say Bowers raged against Jews during and after the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history.\n\nBowers, who was shot and wounded during a gun battle that injured four police officers, walked into court under his own power, his left arm heavily bandaged. He was in a wheelchair at his first court appearance on Monday.\n\nBowers, who is stocky and square-faced with salt-and-pepper, closely cropped hair, frowned as the charges were read but did not appear to have a reaction as a federal prosecutor announced he could face a death sentence. He told a prosecutor he had read the indictment.\n\nOne of his federal public defenders, Michael Novara, said Bowers pleaded not guilty, \u201cas is typical at this stage of the proceeding.\u201d\n\nBowers had been set for a preliminary hearing on the evidence, but federal prosecutors instead took the case to a grand jury.\n\nThe panel issued the indictment as funerals continued for the victims.\n\nJared Younger of Los Angeles told mourners that he waited for hours Saturday for his father to pick up his phone or let them know he was all right.

The ambassador noted that it was the same type of cancer that Sen. John McCain had prior to 2008 (that cancer was different from the cancer that took McCain\u2019s life earlier this year). The former Arizona senator was a mentor figure to Huntsman, who also lost his father to cancer this year.\n\n\u201cIt kind of puts things in perspective,\u201d the ambassador said of his diagnosis.\n\nHe will need regular checkups to ensure the cancer does not spread.\n\nHuntsman said he has been careful not to reveal his condition to anyone in Moscow until now. According to the Deseret News, he is wary of \u201cwhat they [Russia] might do with the information,\u201d since he has already found himself the target of state media propaganda. He assumes his Moscow residence is bugged.\n\nThe lengthy feature touched on Huntsman\u2019s experience navigating diplomatic ties between the U.S. and Russia, strained by the latter\u2019s alleged interference in the U.S. 2016 election. He also discussed his relationship with President Donald Trump, who named him ambassador to Russia in July 2017.\n\nAlthough Huntsman faced calls for his resignation after Trump\u2019s highly controversial Helsinki summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he would not speak negatively of the president.\n\nOn the alleged election interference, Huntsman told the paper that there is \u201cno lingering doubt about the importance of this issue\u201d between the two nations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very serious violation of our political sovereignty. I say political sovereignty because it went right to the heart and soul of our values and our belief system as a country, whether you\u2019re a Republican or Democrat,\u201d he told the paper.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the believability, the trust in our democracy, our system, and when you start to rip that down and divide and create propaganda messaging that begins to split people and take positions on both extremes on issues like guns and race relations, this has potentially a deleterious impact on the well-being of our civil society.\u201d\n\nHuntsman would not say how the U.S. would respond were Russia to interfere in the upcoming midterm elections, but he said \u201cit could be pretty dramatic.\u201d", "Praise Satan all you want, but Michelle Gomez better be next on your list, because no one\u2019s done the devil better or badder than she does in \u201cThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,\u201d which premiered Friday on Netflix.\n\nIf you\u2019re the slightest bit familiar with the extended \u201cRiverdale\u201d universe, which the \u201cSabrina\u201d reboot falls under, then you know that while the series\u2019 action largely concerns itself with well-muscled teens, the juiciest plotlines actually belong to the grown-ups. This holds true with \u201cChilling Adventures,\u201d particularly when Gomez arrives as a she-devil in disguise, slithering her way into teen witch Sabrina Spellman\u2019s life by taking the form of her favorite high school teacher, the meek Miss Wardwell.\n\nThe reboot endorses the long-held supernatural trope that being possessed by the devil instantly turns you into a regulation hot person. But Gomez vamps it up with a dollop of self-awareness, so that when her character starts to don low-cut blouses, favor truly exquisite blowouts and feast upon the hearts of pizza delivery boys, it\u2019s impossible not to root for her.\n\nHer true identity (spoiler alert, but binge faster!) as Madam Satan isn\u2019t made explicit until the season\u2019s final moments. (Fans of the comic book will easily clock the reveal from the opening episode.) But the Scottish actress manages to steal every last scene she\u2019s in along the way. While Gomez was at work filming Season 2, HuffPost spoke with her about the key to making a memorable baddie, why our culture just can\u2019t get enough of the occult, and what advice she\u2019d give to Satan if he comes knocking.\n\nYou make being bad look so fun, which tracks because you\u2019ve had some practice playing antagonists on shows like \u201cDoctor Who.\u201d What\u2019s the trick to being a good villain?\n\nIt helps having this face. I was clearly born to play witches and bitches for eternity. Especially when it comes to screen, a lot of the time you\u2019re cast by the way you look. Looks aside, perhaps why I\u2019ve had success with playing villains in the past is because I don\u2019t see them as villains. I see them as your worst best friend. I enjoy working out why they are the way they are. We\u2019re all products of our existence and the sum of our choices, and if you continually make bad choices you\u2019re inviting some darker consequences.\n\nIn terms of villains I played in the past, I\u2019ve always been determined to try and not just play evil, because that\u2019s kind of boring for you and for me. I\u2019m able to hopefully give her some charm and likability, and that then gives the character some power to wield \u2015 the power of manipulation.\n\nWe first meet you as Miss Wardwell and then a few bloody moments later we\u2019re introduced to Madam Satan. Cue a blissfully campy makeover moment when she walks down the halls of the high school with a new look and attitude. What was it like executing that change?\n\nOne of the biggest draws for me of the character is that I get to play those two sides arguably of that one person. All of us think things we shouldn\u2019t think, but Madam Satan gets to do the things we never do. Coming from Miss Wardwell\u2019s point of view \u2015 being this quiet, meek, reliable member of the teaching faculty \u2015 I\u2019m quite sure she at some point would\u2019ve dreamt of busting out of that plaid skirt and taking on her world.\n\nI just loved that I was able to take that long, slow walk down that corridor and evolve by the time I got to the end of it as Madam Satan. It\u2019s fun playing the baddie because the rules don\u2019t really apply to you in the same way if you were playing another character that wasn\u2019t quite as twisted. It\u2019s probably clear that I\u2019m having a blast.\n\nOK, we need to take a quick sidebar and talk about your hair, because it\u2019s Connie Britton-levels of glorious and deserves its own Wikipedia page.\n\nI definitely think my hair deserves a shoutout here. Let\u2019s face it, I have incredibly talented hair. I mean, it was basically my hair that got the part. It\u2019s nothing to do with my acting abilities [laughs]. God just kept giving me hair. He didn\u2019t give me an ass, he didn\u2019t give me any lips. He just kept giving me hair. Like 10 people live on my head! There needs to be a Madam Satan doll.\n\nI\u2019m starting the petition right after this interview.\n\nWe used to have these Barbie dolls where you were able to pull her hair out of the top her head and then you wind it back in again. Madam Satan needs her own doll where you keep pulling out her fabulous hair.\n\nDid you base the characterization on the comic books, or were there other devilish figures in pop culture that you looked to for inspiration? In certain moments, I was getting some Elizabeth Hurley in \u201cBedazzled\u201d vibes.\n\nNot from the horror genre, but more from the kind of character genre. I don\u2019t know about any other actors, but I\u2019m always convinced I\u2019ll get fat after the table read, so I had to have a really strong voice in my head to drown that out. It\u2019s Katharine Hepburn meets Glenn Close. Those two women together for me are Madam Satan.\n\nNothing in this world has ever made more sense to me.\n\nGod love me, I\u2019m a working-class actor from Scotland and have these heady heights of ever reaching the magnificence that those two women inspire, but those are the two that I take with me into work every day. I have Katherine on one side and Glenn on the other, and the three of us just walk onto set and it\u2019s like, \u201cHave a nice day girls! Let\u2019s see what we can get up to today.\u201d\n\nYou have this wonderful thick Scottish accent that we hear none of in the show. Did you have a dialect coach for the role? Because you deliver your lines with such variety, sometimes speaking with only a whisper, but always with this devilish hint.\n\nI really did fall down the Katharine Hepburn hole. Not doing an impersonation, by any stretch of the imagination, but I wanted to get a tone, an era and a feel vocally to translate what [series creator Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa] has beautifully provided for me on the page and then make it my own. With a Scottish accent, our consonants can easily be drawn out into American sound, so I wanted to play with that and see if I could make it some otherworldly voice as well.\n\nBut you also communicate so much without saying anything at all in many scenes by just slinking in the background and smiling mischievously. Did anyone ever tell you to pull it back on set because you were doing too much?\n\nI\u2019m sure that half of my performance at this moment in time is on the cutting room floor. I clearly like to play, and in that play, there will always be little bits of magic hopefully, but some of it won\u2019t be appropriate. It\u2019s a new show and there\u2019s a lot of wonderful, amazing characters, and everybody has to find their place and fit together, right? In the beginning, it was about finding the right tone and nobody quite knew what that was yet.\n\nIt was a balancing act of how far you could push it and then always making sure you give them a little variety so you can go from a more refined, subtler performance to batshit crazy. Somewhere between those two rocks I sit. There\u2019s a lot of people in that show and it\u2019s a big, gorgeous ensemble. Everyone has a bite of the apple, literally.\n\nIn the final episode, you compel Sabrina to sign the Book of the Beasts with this speech about power and how women are taught to fear it. She says Sabrina should not only accept power, but take and wield it. Do you think this is how Madam Satan conceptualizes her own journey through the series?\n\nYes, you\u2019re onto something there, but I can\u2019t talk much more about it because it\u2019s in development in her storyline that\u2019s coming more in Season 2. As I say, there\u2019s always a reason for the way we behave. There\u2019s a reason why she\u2019s evil and why she wants Sabrina for the dark side. It can just be because she feels like it. The audience will discover that as we get further along. But yes, the notion of being a powerful woman in a patriarchal society is very old for her and also because certain things perhaps have happened. I\u2019ve got to be really careful I\u2019m in spoiler territory here! Wherever we end on the end of Season 1 with Sabrina deeply resonates with Madam Satan directly.\n\nEverything occult and witches are in the zeitgeist right now with the \u201cSabrina\u201d reboot and \u201cCharmed\u201d returning to TV. Why do you think witchcraft is such a popular metaphor for how women specifically navigate the world?\n\nIt\u2019s sort of the fantasy that we can magic things away and gives us this delicious idea that we are in control somehow and can change things. The world out there is pretty dark and the whole world of witchcraftery is exciting. It\u2019s not just about making wishes and having them come true. It\u2019s darker and deeper than that. It takes us from our childhood beliefs into a more adult version of believing something more powerful than ourselves is out here making things happen. There\u2019s fantasy in there, but there\u2019s also the distraction from being who you perceive yourself to be. It\u2019s fun and not entirely dark because there\u2019s an odd hope in there, too.\n\nDo you have any advice to impart to the person who will eventually play the devil?\n\nWatch out. I\u2019m coming for you. There\u2019s not much that\u2019s gonna get past Madam Satan at the moment. She\u2019s not going to go down without a fight and she\u2019s got lot of fight left in her. She hasn\u2019t even begun. I mean, she\u2019s literally just lifted an eyebrow and maybe a finger.", "Talk show host Andy Cohen\u2019s interview with actress Debra Winger drove him to the bottle.\n\n\u201cDaddy needs a drink,\u201d he wrote on Twitter after the awkward exchange with the three-time Oscar nominee on \u201cWatch What Happens Live.\u201d According to People, the host added on his Instagram story: \u201cTonight\u2019s show was rough.

(The RGA has reportedly put over $1 million into PACs supporting Scott.)\n\n\u201cI voted for Phill Scott,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, like a lot of people in Vermont, I\u2019m highly dissatisfied. He talked about affordability and taking care of the most vulnerable. But he vetoed a bill to raise the minimum wage. He vetoed a bill that would have given family leave. He vetoed a bill that would have protected our children from toxins in toys. And he vetoed a bill would have made polluters pay. So he\u2019s pretty much shown that he\u2019s following a national playbook of the GOP.\u201d\n\nHallquist has been focusing on racial justice and discrimination. She recalled being \u201cin denial\u201d last year and believing that Vermont, a progressive bastion, would be \u201cprotected\u201d from the ugly effects President Donald Trump\u2019s administration was having on U.S. culture.\n\n\u201cBut in late 2017, we started to see white supremacist activity in Vermont,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t seen that since the early \u201980s. We\u2019ve got to address the issues of racism.\u201d\n\nI have an obligation to people of color to make our state a more diverse state and a welcoming state. Christine Hallquist\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from the LGBT community,\u201d she added, referencing how Vermont has been a leader on LGBTQ rights and marriage equality. \u201cI feel the LGBT community has been well-taken care of in Vermont. And I have an obligation to people of color to make our state a more diverse state and a welcoming state.\u201d\n\nShe is also committed to taking on Trump, who has attacked the transgender community and pandered to evangelical Christians, most recently by suggesting the government could redefine gender and make \u201ctransgender\u201d nonexistent in any federal policy.\n\n\u201cThis is about radicalized Christians going after the rest of us,\u201d Hallquist said flatly. \u201cI\u2019m a Christian and have been a Christian all of my life. Only a radicalized Christian would attack a community and try to wipe them out of existence. And that\u2019s what our president is doing \u2015 catering to evangelicals who call themselves Christians.\u201d\n\nHallquist, who was CEO of Vermont Electric Cooperative for 12 years until she resigned to run for office, has also made clean energy a cornerstone of her campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve committed my life to solving climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cWill do the same as governor. I\u2019ve already started talking with a delegation from Canada, as well as the former governor of Colorado, who\u2019s got an accord of 19 states committed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I left [my last job], we were 96 percent carbon-free and we were offering people incentives for moving away from fossil fuel for heating, cooling and transportation,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd we did it without a rate increase for five years. We can solve climate change and it does not need to cost more money.\u201d\n\nHallquist said \u201cit\u2019s not a big deal\u201d to people in her home state that she is a transgender gubernatorial candidate, and pointed to Vermont\u2019s acceptance of LGBTQ people. But she is \u201chearing that I provide hope, and I\u2019m proud to provide hope to people across the country.\u201d", "Jimmy Fallon transformed himself into President Donald Trump once again Wednesday night to deliver a message tailored for individual states ahead of next week\u2019s midterms.\n\nBut try as he might, \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d host\u2019s bogus POTUS just couldn\u2019t read the teleprompter right \u2015 giving rise to a series of amusing outtakes.", "Simon Dawson / Reuters World Wide Web founder Tim Berners-Lee speaks during an interview ahead of a speech at the Mozilla Festival 2018 in London, Britain, on October 27, 2018.

They also asked for changes to Google\u2019s human resources practices intended to make bringing harassment claims a fairer process.\n\nGoogle Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said in a statement that \u201cemployees have raised constructive ideas\u201d and that the company was \u201ctaking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action.\u201d\n\nThe dissatisfaction among Alphabet\u2019s 94,000 employees and tens of thousands more contractors has not noticeably affected company shares. But employees expect Alphabet to face recruiting and retention challenges if their concerns go unaddressed.\n\nThe demonstrations follow a New York Times report last week that said Google in 2014 gave a $90 million exit package to Andy Rubin after the then-senior vice president was accused of sexual harassment.\n\nRubin denied the allegation in the story, which he also said contained \u201cwild exaggerations\u201d about his compensation.

We have a problem.\u201d\n\nThis is not my son talking, but one of the stylists on set who has come to fetch me because something has gone wrong.\n\nI\u2019m not allowed to watch my 4-year-old\u2019s photo shoots because I\u2019m distracting. I can see what\u2019s going on from behind a monitor if I want, but I can\u2019t step on set unless they really need me. And in our two years of doing this, I\u2019ve only been called on set twice.\n\nEven before I step behind the tall curtains meant to shield the models from the rest of the room, I can hear him. Laughing maniacally, making funny sounds and otherwise screeching over the pleas of the photographer and wrangler (yes, that\u2019s really his title) to please just smile at the camera! In other words, he\u2019s acting like your average 4-year-old who doesn\u2019t want to have his picture taken. Except this 4-year-old\u2019s job is to have his picture taken.\n\nWe fell into all of this mostly by accident. After a local parenting magazine asked for volunteer models, my then-5-year-old daughter\u2019s picture was spotted on Instagram. We were invited in for an interview with an agent and all three kids were signed amid a whirlwind of paperwork and explanations about \u201centertainment work permits.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Anna Gracia The picture of my daughter, Tigerlily, that started it all.\n\nI initially thought having my kids try modeling would be a bit of fun. Maybe I\u2019d get a good picture or two of them, since I could never manage to capture one on my own camera. The idea of getting paid for it was just a bonus \u2015 a lucky addition to their previously neglected 529 college savings accounts. (That\u2019s life as a family of five!)\n\nThen my son hit on the incredibly lucky combination of being the right age at the right time with whatever they were looking for at a casting for Old Navy only a few months in. We found ourselves thrust into the major leagues of modeling, and his picture was suddenly in stores across the globe and online for anyone to see.\n\nCourtesy of Anna Gracia It took me several visits to work up the courage, but I finally asked if I could take the photo home when the store was done with it.\n\nBefore his brother or sister had booked a single job, my son\u2019s career began to snowball. Videos for Lego, the launch of Allbirds\u2019 kids shoes, even a short film entry for the Cannes Film Festival \u2015 if I hadn\u2019t been so busy playing chauffeur I probably would have walked down the street carrying printed copies of his latest headshots for everyone to see like Auntie Lindo in \u201cThe Joy Luck Club.\u201d\n\nBy landing such large campaigns so early on, we inadvertently found ourselves surrounded by kids who had been doing this a lot longer with parents who were much more invested in it. Some of them, like the mom who filmed her daughter\u2019s every musing to upload to social media, clearly had designs on their child becoming a star. Others, like the dad who couldn\u2019t stop gushing to his daughter about the $300 she was making from the day\u2019s shoot, saw modeling as an investment.\n\nI quickly realized child modeling isn\u2019t only about having a cute kid with a pleasant attitude. Child models are successful because they have parents who treat it like it\u2019s their job, too.\n\nIt\u2019s a job that requires you to constantly be on call, ready to drop everything with a day\u2019s notice and drive, sometimes, hours away for a five-minute casting. It\u2019s a job that requires you to juggle babysitters for siblings, appointments and the rest of your family\u2019s life around one child\u2019s schedule.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a job, as I discovered, that sometimes requires you to try to coax your child to put on a smile and do their job when they\u2019ve had to sit quietly backstage for four hours before getting into hair and makeup. (Yes, even toddlers get makeup. Most of them love it.)\n\nCourtesy of Anna Gracia Makeup can be as little as lotion and lip gloss or a full face of foundation, blush and eye makeup.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I reflexively apologize to the entire crew for my son\u2019s behavior. \u201cHe\u2019s just tired.\u201d They all nod understandingly as I bounce his baby brother in my arms, trying to keep him quiet so as not to draw attention to the fact that I have brought two cranky children to set today.\n\n\u201cSo can we give him some cookies for energy?\u201d the stylist asks, holding up a handful of Oreos. Understanding is one thing. But they still have a shot to get.\n\nWhether the sudden infusion of sugar in the late afternoon will cause my son to crash on the way home, thereby keeping him \u2015 and his siblings \u2015 awake all night is not of consequence to them. If he can\u2019t perform, they have another kid backstage waiting to take his place. I\u2019ve seen children sent off set (nicely, of course) and not called back again. It may sound cutthroat, but it\u2019s nothing personal. They have a business to run.\n\nSo I agree to the Oreos, watching silently from the corner of the set as assistants stuff cookies into the open mouth of my child whose eyes are now half-closed. I think of Judy Garland, who was given \u201cpep pills\u201d as a child to keep pace with her grueling acting schedule, only to be given sleeping pills at night to counteract the effects. I\u2019m being overly dramatic, of course. But watching my son lift his head to be fed water after slowly eating each cookie leads me to wonder: How many steps away am I from accidentally creating the next Lindsay Lohan?\n\nI\u2019ve tried to preserve my son\u2019s innocence about the whole thing. Instead of speculating whether his photo will end up in stores, we devote our energy to discussing the finer points of each client or location\u2019s buffet offerings. (His favorite: pineapple. Mine: tacos.) To avoid the pressure and (frequent) disappointment of castings, we call them \u201cmini photo shoots\u201d and take turns assembling different outfits from his closet.\n\nMost importantly, I never ever refer to modeling as a \u201cjob\u201d while he\u2019s within earshot. To him, it\u2019s a fun activity I\u2019ve signed him up for, no different from the way other kids go to soccer or music classes. He meets friends, eats snacks and plays with toys. Seeing his own picture later almost always comes as a surprise, as he\u2019s usually long forgotten about the day he shot it.\n\nOf course, this means the burden falls to me to make responsible decisions about both his present and future. Because while he likes modeling, he doesn\u2019t fully understand all that it entails. And what kind of responsible parent lets someone stuff their kid\u2019s face with cookies just to get a photo?\n\nUltimately, the Oreo bribe worked and the photo from that shoot went on to become a very large billboard of sorts \u2015 which, I\u2019m not going to lie, was very cool. But the decisions I face can only grow more complicated from here.\n\nWhat happens when cookies are not enough of an incentive and he doesn\u2019t want his picture taken at all? Or, now that he\u2019s in kindergarten, what happens when I have to choose whether to have him skip a day of school for a job?\n\nFor now, I\u2019m trying to focus on the fact that he enjoys modeling and not overshadow it with my worries. And when the day comes that I have to decide whether to give him a push, I just hope it\u2019s in the right direction.", "In the lead-up to this year\u2019s midterm elections, HuffPost Opinion asked writers to examine the many ways that voting \u2015 a fundamental and hard-won civil right \u2015 is imperiled in the United States. In far too many cases, Americans are blocked from exercising that right. This piece is part of that series, Democracy Denied.\n\nBefore August 2018, few people outside the state of Georgia had ever heard of little Randolph County, in the rural southwestern part of the state, land that was once used for plantations. That\u2019s when elections officials and their hired consultants unveiled a plan to close seven of the county\u2019s nine polling places, all in precincts where the majority of voters are African-American. After a spate of bad press, including national coverage in The Washington Post, Randolph County officials hastily voted down the plan. It was a clear victory for Georgia voters.\n\n\n\nBut by then, the Randolph County Board of Elections had opened a can of worms and revealed a new strategy for suppressing voters: pitting natural allies \u2015 people of color and people with disabilities \u2015 against each other.\n\n\n\nThe board and the consultant they hired \u2015 Mike Malone, a supporter of Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp, who\u2019s currently Georgia secretary of state \u2015 justified closing roughly 80 percent of their polling places by arguing the sites were not compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. They provided very little evidence to support this claim, showing no actual survey results derived from publicly available survey tools created by the Department of Justice. (The DOJ is responsible for enforcing the ADA and issues the very guidelines for polling place accessibility that are used to determine whether a polling place is ADA-compliant.)\n\n\n\nInstead, the board shared a set of slides featuring photos of polling places that, admittedly, looked less than accessible, but that could also be fixed easily and at low cost. They flaunted images of paved walkways that violated the ADA\u2019s minimal requirements because they did not connect to paved parking lots. As if wheelchairs would be abandoned forever in a few feet of grass that could have been covered easily with a cheap plank of wood to complete the accessible pathway.\n\nA new strategy for suppressing voters: pitting natural allies \u2015 people of color and people with disabilities \u2015 against each other.\n\nThe board\u2019s tactics amount to a local board of elections calling into question the DOJ\u2019s enforcement of the ADA and undermining disability rights advocacy on a national stage. As the Randolph County plan garnered national attention, disability rights advocates were forced to defend the need for accessible polling places at all. They were also forced to defend settlement agreements between the DOJ and counties with inaccessible polling places. Because of the Randolph County plan, these agreements, which were intended to enforce the ADA and protect the right to vote for people with disabilities, were painted as a voter suppression effort.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s true that America\u2019s polling places have an accessibility problem. In 2016, the Government Accountability Office found that only 40 percent of polling places were fully accessible \u2015 and as dismal as that number may seem, it\u2019s an all-time high. All over the country, voters with disabilities are fighting to vote despite their polling places having too few accessible parking spaces or no paved lot at all, doors that are too heavy to pull open, ramps that are too steep or dangerous and makeshift ramps assembled from folding tables propped up on wooden blocks. Once inside, many accessible voting stations are not set up for wheelchair access, they allow other voters waiting in line to observe the ballot being marked and they do not have headphones ready for blind voters to use the audio function. They may not even be set up and turned on.\n\nPolling places that are inaccessible and threaten to disenfranchise eligible voters with disabilities are a long-standing and nationwide problem, and election officials must act to come into full compliance with the ADA. Disability rights advocates will not back down from this position, and we will continue to survey polling sites and work collaboratively with elections officials to solve their accessibility woes.\n\nIn 2016, the Government Accountability Office found that only 40 percent of polling places were fully accessible \u2015 and that's an all-time high.\n\nYet, disability rights advocates are not asking, and have never asked, for large numbers of polling places to be closed in the name of the ADA, because closing polling places benefits no voters. Imagine that all the noncompliant polling places \u2015 60 percent of all existing sites \u2015 are closed. If the increased distance to the remaining polling places sounds like a barrier for the average voter, imagine what it might take to get there if your disability prevented you from driving and, like most Americans, your public transit options were lacking or nonexistent. Are the remaining, ADA-compliant, polling places really accessible if no one can get to them? Of course not. That\u2019s why disability rights advocates routinely assist in surveying polling places and typically recommend low-cost solutions and same-day modifications to make them more accessible \u2015 or help find an alternate location that is more accessible and, importantly, nearby.\n\n\n\nIn areas where finding accessible or readily adaptable polling places proves difficult, federal and state laws provide for any number of solutions to prevent mass polling place closures. People with disabilities can typically cast an absentee ballot, vote curbside at the inaccessible polling place or have voting equipment brought to them in their homes. Solutions such as portable ramps, temporary parking signs and door props are affordable and can be supplied by the elections authority, and these solutions can be implemented without requiring costlier upgrades like pouring a cement ramp.\n\nWhile these solutions are not ideal, they exist for a reason: to help alleviate the need to make 100 percent of America\u2019s polling places immediately accessible when elections administrators face high barriers and limited options, while still ensuring that all eligible voters have a means to cast their ballots.\n\n\n\nPolling places have failed to comply with the ADA for years. The problem is persistent and widespread. So, we must ask: Why has the Randolph County Board of Elections suddenly become so concerned about that problem? Why now? Why here? No other counties in the U.S. with similarly dismal accessibility ratings suddenly felt so pressed to comply with the ADA that they tried to close the majority of their voting sites immediately before a major midterm election. Before August of this election year, this little county\u2019s polling places were not on anyone\u2019s radar.\n\nPolling places have failed to comply with the ADA for years. ... Why has the Randolph County Board of Elections suddenly become so concerned about that problem?\n\nPerhaps we can\u2019t know the answers to those questions. But we do know the county in question is majority African-American. We also know that the entire state of Georgia has a documented history of suppressing the black vote and was consequently subject to federal pre-clearance under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That pre-clearance would have prevented mass poll closures \u2015 before it was weakened by the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Shelby County v. Holder in 2013.\n\n\n\nCompleting the proposed closures in Randolph County would have jeopardized access to the vote for the county\u2019s 1,700 registered voters and stopped black voters from exercising their civil rights by targeting precincts where up to 98-99 percent of voters are African-American. If it looks like voter suppression and it sounds like voter suppression, then it probably is voter suppression. Only this time, there\u2019s a new scapegoat: people with disabilities. Using the ADA to close polling places constitutes nothing more than an attempt to suppress minority voters by pitting natural civil rights allies \u2015 voters of color and voters with disabilities \u2015 against each other.\n\n\n\nWe must stay vigilant against these kinds of attacks in turbulent political times, as we head into the midterm elections. People with disabilities will not back down from demanding full enforcement of the ADA, making all of America\u2019s polling places accessible and ending voter suppression in all its forms. We know our allies across civil rights movements will stand with us in solidarity, and we will not be silent when any marginalized voters are being challenged or suppressed. We, the people \u2015 the people of color, the people with disabilities \u2015 are not fooled.

But there aren\u2019t a ton of ways for a 20-something to blow off steam.\n\nPlus, the motorcycle scene in South Florida is more to his liking. Ramirez is a Suzuki guy, and Iowa bikers tend to prefer Harley-Davidsons. Some of his friends will ride their bikes on the gravel roads that crisscross local farms, but he\u2019s not so bold as to risk his prized possessions on such treacherous terrain.\n\nBut the thing that really has Ramirez looking for the exits is the racism. In Miami, he notes wistfully, hundreds of languages can be heard on the streets.\n\nRamirez\u2019s parents emigrated from Mexico before he was born, and he says he\u2019s endured a constant stream of intolerance. Ramirez, 22, was born in Minnesota and spent his adolescence in Iowa, and his accent possesses all the flattened vowels you might expect from a born-and-bred Midwestern boy. He says his customers often clam up when they see that the person whom they spoke with over the phone isn\u2019t the color they expected.\n\nIt\u2019s a dynamic that has nagged Ramirez for his professional life to date. He says he had to quit one job at a local restaurant and chastise employees at a UPS store he previously managed because of racist comments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually the older crowd,\u201d says Ramirez, recalling several incidents in the previous few weeks. In one, a poster on a local email list demanded some of the members stop \u201cspeaking Mexican.\u201d In another, Ramirez overheard a patron at an area gas station cursing about \u201cfuckin\u2019 Mexicans.\u201d\n\nGiven Ramirez\u2019 experiences, you may not be surprised to learn Denison falls squarely in the fatty part of the 4th Congressional District, which stretches over the state\u2019s northwestern quadrant, jabbing a finger into the 1st Congressional District in the northeastern part of the state. The 4th is represented by Steve King, easily Congress\u2019 most vocal racist.\n\n\u201cVocal\u201d is an understatement: Steve King has forgone the traditional dog whistle in favor of a brass ensemble with kazoo accompaniment. This is the guy who went on CNN in 2017 and said that he\u2019d \u201clike to see an America that is just so homogenous that we look a lot the same\u201d; who denounced immigrants for \u201cundermining our culture and civilization,\u201d claiming most have \u201ccalves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert\u201d; who pals around with a Dutch white nationalist and has denounced interracial relationships because, in his words, \u201cWe can\u2019t restore our civilization with somebody else\u2019s babies.\u201d\n\nIn this regard, King, whose office declined to cooperate for this piece, is doing the public a perverse kind of civic favor. Instead of forcing it to decipher veiled statements about law and order or welfare recipients \u2015 a tactic so commonplace it\u2019s effectively the racist handbook\u2019s I formation \u2015 King just lets \u2019er rip, allowing the electorate to divert its brain cells toward untangling other injustices. Even the most naive, both-sidesy observer can conclude that King is an unapologetic racist.\n\nBut the thing is, Steve King is still in Congress, and if identifying his racism is such a layup, why on earth do people keep re-electing this guy?\n\nEliot Nelson Kiron, Iowa, just a short drive from Denison, is where Steve King calls home.\n\nThe short answer to King\u2019s political success is that the 4th Congressional district is \u2015 like King \u2015 pretty racist, owing in large part to being \u2015 like King \u2015 aging, white and isolated. Yet to end the story there is to oversimplify a surprisingly complex district and ignore trends that are diversifying some of America\u2019s rural areas and could turn them purple \u2015 or at least less red \u2015 far sooner than you might think.\n\nFor one thing, King isn\u2019t actually that isolated from people who don\u2019t look like him. The region is home to a growing number of immigrants, many drawn to jobs at the area\u2019s meat processing plants, such as the Smithfield pork plant that\u2019s five minutes from Ramirez\u2019s business. It\u2019s brutal work, some of the most dangerous in the country, and its wages have been effectively stagnant for decades, thanks in no small part to widespread deunionization. It\u2019s become the sort of first-rung job that would only be considered a lateral move or step up for people escaping worse conditions elsewhere.\n\nIndeed, northwest Iowa has played host to a comparatively large number of refugees in recent decades, including those from Laos, El Salvador and the Sudans. Storm Lake, a town 50 miles north of Denison where King was born, has become the poster child for the region\u2019s diversification and status as a safe haven, having been profiled by news outlets ranging from The New York Times and PRI to Saveur and VICE.\n\nA significant portion of Iowa\u2019s Hispanic population is clustered in this part of the state. Several of its towns and small cities, including Storm Lake, have declared themselves \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d meaning they won\u2019t aid federal efforts to crack down on undocumented immigrants.\n\nThere\u2019s the growing number of businesses featuring Spanish surnames or catering to Spanish-speaking customers. Taquerias, Hispanic groceries and clothing stores sporting brightly colored quincea\u00f1era dresses in their front windows are an increasingly common sight on local main streets. Among the most salient instances is Uribe Family Dentistry in Sioux Center, right next to a shrine to a previous era of immigration: the German Farmers Mutual Insurance Association.\n\nAnd then there is Denison, where Steve King attended high school and from which his current home in Kiron is a 15-minute drive. To tour Denison is to survey a town that must drive Steve King absolutely bonkers, right up to and including the Civil War memorial in the town\u2019s courthouse square commemorating the area\u2019s Union dead. (King notoriously keeps a miniature Confederate battle flag on his desk even though the Hawkeye State never seceded).\n\nDenison is the seat of Crawford County, which encompasses Kiron, and the county has Iowa\u2019s largest Hispanic population by percentage. St. Rose of Lima, the local Catholic Church, offers Spanish-language mass. La Prensa, the region\u2019s Spanish-language newspaper, is headquartered in Denison.\n\nIts schools are majority or near-majority Hispanic, and Denison High School is staffed with English-as-a-second-language instructors and a migrant liaison. Just this year, the school approved a new bilingual curriculum. Denison High has a mariachi band made up of a diverse set of young musicians. The next time you\u2019re feeling down about the world, try thinking about the multiracial mariachi band at Steve King\u2019s old high school.\n\nFor Lorena Lopez, editor of La Prensa, it\u2019s notable that King harbors such animosity toward a community that isn\u2019t an abstraction or the subject of a sensational story on Breitbart, but one right under his nose. Lopez recalls seeing King exiting the 9:30 a.m. English service at St. Rose of Lima as Lopez and others filed in to the 11 a.m. Spanish one. Lopez notes that King regularly bears witness to a community that lives out so many of the values of faith and family that King\u2019s party trumpets.\n\n\u201cYou go to [local] quincea\u00f1eras, and you\u2019ll see a beautiful white teenager girl dancing with a Latino adolescent guy, or vice versa, and it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d says Lopez.\n\nLopez\u2019s own story mirrors that of many of her readers. She came to Iowa from Managua, Nicaragua, in the early 1990s as part of an exchange program for journalists. Life in Iowa offered a level of peace and prosperity unavailable back home, which was recovering from decades of conflict (and where earlier this year violence once again erupted as Daniel Ortega\u2019s government cracked down on student protesters).\n\nLopez ultimately settled down in the district, raising three boys, founding La Prensa and becoming a fixture in the region\u2019s growing Spanish-speaking community, interviewing political heavy hitters like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as they campaigned for the presidency.\n\n\u201cWithout immigration, Denison would not be what it is,\u201d said Jared Beymer, Denison\u2019s mayor. \u201cRural Iowa would be dying.\u201d Beymer abhors Steve King\u2019s politics of exclusion, but he wasn\u2019t always a staunch opponent.\n\nLike King, Beymer belongs to the district\u2019s old guard: He grew up white and conservative in a place that for generations had been both things. The prevailing assumption \u2015 and one that Beymer himself admits having subscribed to for a long time \u2015 was that the social safety net existed for freeloaders mooching off of the government.\n\nTwo developments set Beymer on a different path. By the time he graduated from Denison High, in 2012, the demographics of his community had changed dramatically. The influx of foreign-born workers, arriving in increasing numbers as the economy recovered from the Great Recession and hiring picked up at area processing plants, put him in touch with families whose backgrounds were different than his own.\n\nSecond was Beymer\u2019s diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri, which in his case manifested as a buildup of spinal fluid. This limited his mobility and forced him to drop out of college. Medicaid helped him pay for his mounting medical bills, and he quickly developed an appreciation for the role that the social safety net plays in keeping people from insolvency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to be afraid of something than to understand it,\u201d Beymer observed.\n\nNow, Beymer is not only a champion of diversity, he is utterly beholden to it, both as a town executive reliant on his new neighbors\u2019 tax revenue and also as a politician whose career is dependent on their votes. It\u2019s a dynamic he\u2019s more than happy with, so much so that the town\u2019s offices share a workspace with La Prensa.\n\nEliot Nelson Lorena Lopez, seen in the offices of La Prensa, often sees Steve King at local events and is bewildered by his hostility to Hispanics.\n\nIf you were to teleport to the 4th District, it might not be immediately apparent why it\u2019s Iowa\u2019s congressional black sheep. In addition to the district\u2019s growing immigrant population \u2015 a common theme across the Hawkeye State \u2015 agriculture is the driving economic and cultural force. Corn and soybean fields blanket the district, interrupted by small towns composed of modest residential plots. Attractions include a near-constant stream of county fairs and the world\u2019s largest popcorn ball in Sac City (weighing in at over 9,000 pounds and rising an imposing eight-plus feet off the ground). In July, the smell of manure is inescapable.\n\nYet the 1st, 2nd and 3rd districts are all classified as swing districts by the Cook Partisan Voting Index while the 4th District has a whopping 11-point Republican slant.\n\nFor one thing, the 4th District is very empty and very white, even by the standards of Iowa and the Midwest. Fifty percent of the district\u2019s population lives in rural communities, well above Iowa\u2019s other three districts. Travel northwest, and the state\u2019s road network grows more rectangular, defined less by unruly urban planning and more by the tidy geometry of farm plots, neatly laid out across the landscape like some kind of continental rebar.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a particular breed of racist old white person here,\u201d quipped George Ensley, a photographer, small business owner and self-described local political troublemaker from Boone, Iowa. Ensley served as chair of the Boone County Democrats for a spell.\n\nOwing to the farm consolidation of the last 30 years, depopulation and, subsequently, the 2010 Census that docked Iowa a congressional district, the area is growing only more remote politically. Abandoned farmhouses, sagging and overgrown, are an increasingly common sight. Just about the only thing that has grown more dense are the crops \u2015 rows of genetically engineered corn stalks are now being grown as close as one foot apart. The good people at Archer Daniels Midland and Cargill have made sure that if Shoeless Joe ever decides to alight in an Iowa cornfield again, he\u2019ll need to bring a machete.\n\nThe prevailing conservatism can be hard to escape. Churches abound, and the only businesses as numerous as places of worship in Kiron \u2015 population 300 \u2015 are seed supply stores. The Republican Party has a strong registration advantage, with 40 percent of voters belonging to the GOP compared to only 25 percent for the Democrats. It is in this part of the state where President Donald Trump received the most support. In the district\u2019s four northwesternmost counties, then-candidate Trump got around 80 percent of the vote.\n\nDemocratic campaign staffers rue the difficulty in getting billboards placed on farmland, the owners often objecting to the party\u2019s message. That said, you can\u2019t drive more than 20 minutes in the 4th District without passing a pro-life billboard informing passers-by at what week in its gestation a fetus has developed the ability to wink at you, or whatever it is they\u2019re claiming.\n\nYet even among Iowa\u2019s more rural areas, the 4th District\u2019s wide-open spaces stand apart. The district\u2019s proximity to Omaha, Nebraska, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota, means many of its communities fall in those municipalities\u2019 media markets. Des Moines is as far as 4 1/2 hours from Sioux Center, meaning the likelihood of rubbing shoulders with people involved with state government are as about as remote here as anywhere in the state.\n\nThis distance, literal and figurative, has fostered resentment. Des Moines has enjoyed an economic boom in recent years, drawing national attention to the economic gains of the various multinational agribusinesses headquartered in the state\u2019s capital. It is the fastest-growing city in the Midwest, according to the Census Bureau, and it enjoys an emerging narrative as the region\u2019s most promising destination for job seekers.\n\nDes Moines\u2019 success, however, have left many in the western part of the state feeling moribund and neglected.\n\nAmong its Midwestern neighbors, Iowa has always been the least receptive to populist politics, dating back to the late 19th century, when farmers in Kansas and Nebraska rallied around the short-lived People\u2019s Party (better known today as the Populist Party), yet Iowans did not. A major reason for this was the responsiveness of Iowa\u2019s Republican legislators, who responded more ably to the era\u2019s shifting economics. That adaptability helped the party take root and thrive in the state through the 20th century, save for several brief periods of Democratic dominance.\n\nJ.D. Scholten, the Democrat running to replace King, is fond of mentioning those periods of Democratic success to dispute the notion that the 4th District is irredeemably Republican. Scholten recalls progressive Democrats like Rep. Berkley Bedell and Sen. Tom Harkin who achieved a degree of political success in the area.\n\nDespite supporting unions and a slew of liberal policies like Medicare for all, Scholten doesn\u2019t describe himself as progressive. He frames his platform as populist, a branding approach he is pursuing all the way down to his retro-looking campaign logo and his unabashedly hokey throwback slogan, \u201cStanding Tall for All!\u201d \u2015 a reference to his lanky, 6-foot-6-inch frame.\n\n\u201cYou talk to these farmers, and they\u2019re anxious about tariffs, but they\u2019re also anxious about health care,\u201d said Scholten. \u201cThey don\u2019t have employer benefits. We talk as much [about health care] as we talk about row crops or pork prices.\u201d\n\nThere are other, more substantive political differences to Scholten\u2019s politics (he describes himself also as an \u201cIowa Democrat\u201d). Scholten\u2019s website says he stands \u201cin full support\u201d of the Second Amendment, and though he supports the right to have an abortion, he says he personally opposes the practice.\n\nA fifth-generation Iowan, Scholten grew up in Sioux City on the westernmost edge of the district, also spending time at the farm his family still owns outside Lake Mills, right near the Minnesota border. His path to political insurgency was somewhat less than traditional. After attending Morningside College in Sioux City, Scholten pursued a professional baseball career, playing semipro ball for a number of teams, including the Sioux City Explorers. After retiring, Scholten became a paralegal. Along the way, he volunteered for a number of Democratic political campaigns, and he traces his political activity back to protesting the United States\u2019 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nScholten believes King\u2019s success has been bolstered by the almost total absence of Democrats offering a competing message. In an era of rising economic inequality and declining standards of living, he sees an opportunity to reframe the debate around the revitalization of America\u2019s rural areas as one of inequality and social justice and not of racial animosity.\n\nHowever there isn\u2019t much Democratic infrastructure to help Scholten spread that message, so to take matters into his own hands, Scholten is driving a Winnebago around the district.\n\n\u201cRetail politics are alive in Iowa,\u201d says Scholten, who is nothing but optimistic about his chances. \u201cHousing has gone up, tuition has gone up, health care has gone up. Wages have stayed the same. The amount of stress put on farmers is starting to pile up.\u201d\n\nEliot Nelson Democrat J.D. Scholten, seen in front of his campaign Winnebago, believes that populist economic policy can appeal to voters in Iowa\u2019s 4th District.\n\nVisibility, or lack thereof, is a theme that is never far from Steve King\u2019s opponents\u2019 minds. The most common complaint among the politically disillusioned of the 4th District is that voters aren\u2019t being engaged by anyone other than Republicans and allies of King\u2019s agenda. If there is to be a political recalibration in the area, they say, people will have to start at square one and simply show up. They bemoan the untold number of state fairs that haven\u2019t had a Democratic Party booth and shudder at all the missed opportunities at dialogue that could have been remedied by a simple meet-and-greet at a local cafe.\n\nMatthew Hildreth, founder and board chair of RuralOrganizing.org, spent much of his life in the area, growing up in eastern South Dakota and living for a time in Iowa\u2019s 4th District. He says the Democratic Party often finds itself stuck in a vicious cycle of not committing to an area because there is no Democratic momentum, precisely because Democrats have not committed to the area.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem that he says doesn\u2019t require a terribly large amount of resources to solve. He recalls hosting a Democratic Party booth at a county fair that was among the event\u2019s most popular, owing to the free face-painting on offer. Simply knowing that there is a Democratic Party to engage with, Hildreth and others told HuffPost, is often enough for people to come out of the woodwork. It may not win elections in the short term, but it\u2019s the kind of piecemeal party-building that does in the long term.\n\nThat philosophy is one that extends to remedying some of the areas ingrained racism.\n\nVicenta Cardenas, a Mexican-born Denison resident who works at the Smithfield plant, doesn\u2019t mince words about some of her neighbors, saying a majority of the area\u2019s white residents are \u201cvery racist.\u201d Yet she does see room for positive growth, recalling her experience moving to the district in the early 2000s and witnessing the unease that existed between the town\u2019s Spanish-speaking population and the local Catholic diocese.\n\nAs she and her fellow Spanish-speaking parishioners got more involved in church affairs, the relationship quickly strengthened, so much so that one local priest, the Rev. Ed Murray, took a six-week crash course in Spanish to better serve his changing parish. When he died in 2009, he was celebrated by Cardenas and others as a champion of the Hispanic community.\n\nCardenas says it\u2019s imperative that her Hispanic colleagues and neighbors make themselves more visible, something that may prove difficult owing to lingering anxieties about deportation. Cardenas says there is a tendency in her community to keep one\u2019s head down. While most of the area\u2019s Hispanic residents are either citizens or documented, enough residents have friends or family who are undocumented that many are afraid of drawing too much attention to themselves or their social circle.\n\nRogelio Cabrera, owner of a local clothing store, is hesitant to comment negatively about Steve King or anyone else, despite having experienced racism himself. He even says he even donated money to Steve King\u2019s campaign after receiving a solicitation in the mail, not because he necessarily agrees with King, but just to be friendly.\n\n\u201cI just want everyone to get along,\u201d Cabrera said through an interpreter. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be nice to one another.\u201d\n\nCabrera\u2019s hesitance over not ruffling feathers is not completely unfounded.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s record number of deportations have made Cardenas and others weary of the Democratic Party\u2019s rhetoric about welcoming immigrants. It\u2019s a suspicion with origins that extend well past the Obama administration, back to when the party, in conjunction with organized labor, was often hostile to immigrants. It\u2019s easy to forget now, but as recently as a decade ago, a plurality of Democrats favored decreased immigration.\n\nYet many of the residents, both Hispanic and white, whom HuffPost spoke with believe that future generations will be more receptive to messages of plurality and inclusion, if only because of the increasing diversity of younger Iowans, who are growing up and attending school alongside people of different backgrounds.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not always that easy. Thanks to widely popular conspiracy outlets like Infowars and the tendency of Facebook and other social media platforms to bolster fringe and unfounded views, many younger people are subscribing to a kind of xenophobia that was once often associated with older, isolated people.\n\nJairo Ramirez recalls seeing the Facebook posts of former high school classmates in which they denounce immigrants and adopt much of the language employed by Steve King. For Ramirez, such posts are especially shocking coming from people who were friendly to to him, the son of immigrants, in person.", "President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign speeches are a merciless moral X-ray, of himself and of his party. To beat back Democrats, he is waging an explicit race war rooted in blatant lies. Illegal immigrants are voting in droves. Democrats are funding a \u201ccaravan\u201d of Hispanic refugees, awash in gang members and Middle Eastern terrorists, to overrun our borders. As he replicates the rhetoric of history\u2019s most vile authoritarians, Republican officeholders grab his soiled coattails.\n\n\u201cThere is no Republican Party,\u201d former House Speaker John Boehner said in April. \u201cThere is a Trump Party. The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere.\u201d\n\nTry irreversible coma. Trump\u2019s GOP has become a Trojan horse for plutocrats, theocrats, bigots and foreign powers hostile to America\u2019s democracy and core ideals.\n\nThis is no time for indifference, the self-indulgence of third-party voting that only aids Republicans, or reflexive loyalty to a principled Republican Party that no longer exists. The GOP\u2019s toxic compound of ethno-nationalism and moral bankruptcy mandates that independents, Democrats and responsible Republicans of all backgrounds and generations unite by voting to deprive this aberrant party of its congressional majority \u2015 and to check an American president transparently in Vladimir Putin\u2019s thrall.\n\nIn terms of genuine principal, the GOP has become a squalid void. What pseudo-policies it has serve a few powerful constituencies with their own narrow priorities: a base filled with racial anxiety; evangelicals bent on repealing same-sex marriage and Roe v. Wade; donors hungry for tax cuts and deregulation; a callous gun lobby that helps perpetuate mass slaughter. Nothing else matters, save avoiding the truth about Trump and Russia by whatever means required.\n\nThe \u201cparty of Lincoln\u201d now breeds xenophobia and racism. Its president falsely accuses blacks and Latinos of electoral fraud, supports laws designed to suppress minority voting, separates nonwhite refugees from their children, shafts Dreamers, and relentlessly stokes white nativism \u2015 all to salvage himself and his party\u2019s craven candidates.\n\nWho will govern us \u2013 the party of white identity, or one that respects our common humanity?\n\nThe party of fiscal responsibility rewards demanding donors with reckless tax cuts that generate trillion-dollar annual deficits. The party that founded the Environmental Protection Agency guts its powers and dismisses the climate change endangering our planet. The party of free trade promotes trade wars and tariffs. The party of human rights supports a president who gives succor to murderous authoritarians around the globe \u2015 from Russia to the Philippines to a megalomaniac in Saudi Arabia who believes, by virtue of Trump\u2019s indulgence, that he can butcher journalists with impunity.\n\nThe party that decries judicial activism appoints conservative ideologues committed to enacting the retrograde social agenda of white evangelicals. The party of middle-class America sabotages Obamacare by driving up premiums and gutting protections for those with pre-existing conditions. The party of working-class whites savages unions and attacks regulations protecting workers from injury or exploitation. The party of phony populism promotes plutocracy.\n\nThe party formerly indignant at the supposed depredations of the Clinton Foundation now countenances a blatantly profiteering president who conceals his tax returns while his properties attract favor-seeking foreign governments in defiance of the Emoluments Clause; a self-serving daughter and son-in-law leveraging their undeserved positions for commercial gain; and a Cabinet awash in petty corruption and potential criminality.\n\nThe party of public safety supports a rhetorical pipe bomber who legitimizes hatred with incendiary accusations, threatens and demonizes political opponents, ignites unreasoning anger against journalists and endangers innocent Americans by praising acts of violence. The party of personal responsibility countenances and reinforces a village bigot who nourishes anti-Semitism by repeating false accusations against prominent Jews.\n\nAnd the party of national security runs interference while our president kowtows to a foreign adversary that aggressively attacked the integrity of an election that made him president.\n\nBRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images\n\nWe see too well what lies ahead. After November, Trump will go after Robert Mueller and his superiors at the Justice Department, acting as a third-world authoritarian to shield his gross misconduct \u2015 the very reason Devin Nunes told donors that the GOP must retain a House majority.\n\nMuch of what Republicans don\u2019t want Americans to know is obvious. Whether Trump conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election in his favor. Whether Trump did this in exchange for a promise of sanctions relief, financial assistance \u2015 or both. Whether Trump obstructed justice to avoid discovery. Whether Trump is a modern-day Manchurian candidate disloyal to his oath of office.\n\nBut another motive for concealment is less obvious: the prospect that Trump literally owes his election to Russian interference \u2015 and, therefore, that Russia\u2019s ongoing interference will be similarly helpful to Trump Republicans this November \u2015 and beyond.\n\nBefore 2016, this question would evoke a paranoid thriller. But in The Washington Post, Max Boot detailed the scope of Russia\u2019s help for Trump \u2015 not only the strategic and devastating release of hacked emails, but a wave of targeted internet propaganda that reached 120 million Americans. Boot quotes the highly respected former FBI agent Clinton Watts: \u201cWithout the Russian interference effort, I believe Trump would not have even been within striking distance of Clinton on Election Day.\u201d\n\nMost recently, after exhaustively studying the impact of Russia\u2019s strategically leaked emails, the esteemed political scientist Catherine Hall Jamieson concluded: \u201cIt is therefore very likely without Russian interventions, Donald J Trump not be the US\u2019s 45th president.\u201d Russia continues these blatant efforts in 2018: Late last month, the DOJ indicted a Russian linked to firms close to Putin for investing $10 million in a targeted social media campaign intended \u201cto sow division and discord in US political system\u201d and thereby \u201cinfluence public sentiment.\u201d\n\nOne certainty emerges: Trump\u2019s GOP is bent on burying the subject of Trump\u2019s ongoing indebtedness to Russia. Transparently, Republican officeholders fear only Trump\u2019s base, its donors \u2015 and the truth. If they can conjure tax cuts and right-wing judges, they no longer care by what means, or whose agency, this happened. When it comes to keeping power, the party of fake principles is willing to partner with Trump and Putin in corrupting American democracy.\n\nTrump has already corrupted the democratic sensibility of Republican base voters. Polling shows that many Republicans don\u2019t care that Trump is a congenital liar; more Republicans than not believe Trump should have the power to shut down news outlets. Most remarkably, 40 percent of Republicans are willing to accept Russian interference in our elections if it helps their party win.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images\n\nWhat accounts for this rejection of democracy itself? Peter Beinart argues in The Atlantic that Trump has upended the very meaning of corruption. For Trump\u2019s followers, the prospect that he has violated the law, ethical norms or even his oath of office no longer counts. Instead, \u201ccorruption\u201d is the imagined degradation of white America by immigrants and minorities who, they believe, are upending the social hierarchy.\n\nFox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham summed it up: \u201cThe America we know and love doesn\u2019t exist anymore. Massive demographic changes have been foisted on the American people \u2026 that none of us ever voted for and most of us don\u2019t want.\u201d In case anyone missed the point, she added: \u201cThis is related to both legal and illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nTo protect himself from political defeat and legal accountability, Trump invites his loyalists to revel in lies, cruelty and bigotry \u2015 weaponizing mass inhumanity. Millions of Americans accept \u2015 or welcome \u2015 the separation, perhaps permanent, of children from their parents. They believe Democrats are facilitating a blitzkrieg across our borders by members of MS-13. They imagine that refugees from war and misery in Syria are terrorists bent on killing Americans. They accept Trump\u2019s blatant falsifications of the crime rate among undocumented immigrants. If Democrats win, he told an audience in Ohio, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have crime all over the place. You\u2019re going to have people pouring across the border.\u201d\n\nBut this racist propaganda serves real policy: Trump and his advisers truly mean to keep America white \u2015 and make it whiter. They are throttling legal immigration from nonwhite countries. They promise to end birthright citizenship without regard to our laws and Constitution. They are proposing to keep legal immigrants from becoming citizens if they use public assistance for themselves \u2015 or their children.\n\nThe stakes in November transcend ideological preferences or partisan differences: They cut to the essence of America itself.\n\nDesperate to keep power, Trump and his party are backing bogus voter ID laws aimed at restricting minority voting. If they can\u2019t kick legal immigrants out of the country, they will keep them from participating in American democracy. As ever, Fox News spreads Trump\u2019s propaganda. Says Tucker Carlson, \u201cThe Latin American countries are changing election outcomes here by forcing demographic change...\u201d\n\nThe stakes in November transcend ideological preferences or partisan differences: They cut to the essence of America itself. Who will govern us \u2015 the party of white identity, or one that respects our common humanity? Will we combat, or promote, hatred and violence? Will we broaden opportunity and security for all, or suffocate hope by empowering plutocracy?\n\nWill we preserve the rule of law and America\u2019s constitutional democracy, or further empower an aspiring autocrat to undermine them both? Will we demand accountability for Russia\u2019s malevolent attacks on our elections, or protect the malefactors at home and abroad?\n\nWhat kind of America awaits millennials and their children: a society that strives to realize its best ideals, or the Hobbesian homeland of Trump and a terminally debased political party which, to preserve itself and its patrons, erodes democracy and metastasizes primordial bigotry?\n\nThis is the defining choice facing voters next Tuesday.", "Damon Dahlen/HuffPost Amy, not her real name, looks out the window of the domestic violence shelter where she currently lives. She's not allowed to tell anyone her address, or have visitors.\n\nTHE BRONX \u2015 Amy, 20, left her boyfriend after he hit her while she was cradling their newborn daughter.\n\nShe did what she could to stay safe from him, she said, reporting the assault to police and getting a protective order. But her ex knew where her family lived. Almost a year later, he spotted her, now heavily pregnant with her second child, leaving her mother\u2019s house, and attacked her from behind.\n\nThat\u2019s when Amy, who asked to be identified with a pseudonym due to safety concerns, decided to flee to one of the city\u2019s domestic violence shelters.\n\nAmy, who lived in Brooklyn, was surprised when she found out she would be relocated to the Bronx, far away from her family, friends and her child\u2019s pediatrician. In New York, domestic violence victims seeking shelter are typically moved to a \u201csafe\u201d borough, which is defined as a borough where they have few family ties and their abuser doesn\u2019t live or work.\n\nWhen she got to the Bronx, Amy wasn\u2019t allowed to tell anyone where she was living \u2015 not even her mother \u2015 or have visitors. That\u2019s because under New York state regulations, domestic violence shelters must keep their addresses confidential or risk losing funding.\n\nWithin a week, she said, she wanted to leave.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not from the Bronx so I don\u2019t know people here,\u201d Amy said. \u201cI\u2019m not used to being on my own.\u201d\n\nAmy\u2019s experience of deep isolation is common among those living in domestic violence shelters in New York, according to a new report released by Safe Horizon, a victim services provider which operates eight shelters here.\n\nIt found that 67 percent of victims surveyed reported feeling emotionally distant or cut off from their support network \u2015 at a time when they needed help the most.\n\nNow, Safe Horizon is trying to solve this dilemma. It\u2019s lobbying to open the state\u2019s first non-confidential domestic violence shelter, which would allow residents to tell others where they are living. Victims like Amy could invite family members over to help her care for her children, cook a meal, or just offer emotional support.\n\nHistory Of Domestic Violence Shelters\n\nDomestic violence shelters first sprung up in the 1970s, said Cindy Southworth, executive vice president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. At the time, most shelters were running on shoestring budgets, and were not equipped with a robust alarm system or 24-hour staff.\n\n\u201cKeeping the location secret was one of the one ways to keep the inhabitants safe,\u201d she explained.\n\nIn the years since, some shelters \u2015 typically those with strong security measures and a collaborative relationship with local police \u2015 have made the decision to come out of hiding, posting signs outside and listing their addresses publicly, Southworth said. Still, most shelters across the country remain in confidential locations.\n\n\u201cSome programs have said, \u2018Look, we are here, domestic violence is part of our community, and we\u2019re not going to hide in the shadows,\u2019 but to make that political statement, you need the luxury of funding,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother reason shelters come out of hiding is that, in practice, it is difficult to keep addresses confidential over time.\n\n\u201cThe taxis know where it is, the delivery people know where it is, the neighbors know where it is \u2015 the only people who don\u2019t know where the shelter is is the victims themselves,\u201d Southworth said.\n\nThe internet has also complicated efforts to keep shelters off the grid, she said, noting that her organization has created a handout for shelter staff with instructions on how to request addresses be removed from search engines like Yahoo and Google.\n\nLacking Support At The Most Critical Time\n\nWhen HuffPost interviewed Amy, she was still recovering from a cesarean section. She moved slowly and carefully, holding her newborn boy, as her toddler daughter stumbled around the room.\n\nHaving a baby in shelter was hard, she said, especially without family members to help out.\n\n\u201cWhen I was home with my mom and grandmother, I could give my daughter to them when I ran an errand, or needed a free moment to myself,\u201d she said. \u201cThis one, I can\u2019t set him down.\u201d\n\nDamon Dahlen/HuffPost Amy poses for a portrait at an undisclosed domestic violence shelter in the New York City area on Oct. 25, 2018.\n\nAmy missed the simple things.\n\nHer mother cooking her a meal. Her best friend dropping by to say hello.\n\nRecently, her mom had gone grocery shopping for her to help her out, but she wasn\u2019t allowed to drop the bags off at the shelter, so Amy had to meet her at a separate location \u2015 carting both kids \u2015 and carry the food back by herself.\n\nAmanda Stylianou, associate vice president of quality and program development at Safe Horizon, said that isolation is one of the primary reasons victims leave shelters, even if it means opening themselves up to danger.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re managing one of the most horrific, violent experiences of their life, and that\u2019s the time they really need family and community support,\u201d she said.\n\nIdeally, New York would have a mix of both confidential and non-confidential domestic violence shelters, Stylianou said. Some victims must stay hidden for safety reasons, especially if their abusers have exhibited high-risk behaviors, like stalking or threats with a firearm. Others may not want their neighbors to know they are domestic violence victims, and may wish to live at a confidential site.\n\n\u201cWhat we would prefer is that survivors can choose, based on their own individual risks and needs, the shelter model that best supports them in the healing process,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now, they don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d\n\nSafe Horizon plans to work with city and state regulators to change rules so that it can open a non-confidential shelter in 2019, she said.\n\nAmy said that was welcome news.", "vgajic via Getty Images\n\nYou\u2019ve probably experienced the euphoria of hopping in the car after a long day of work, turning up your favorite tune and singing along like you\u2019re performing at the Grammys. But you might not realize that it\u2019s actually good for your health.\n\nMusic alone can increase antibodies that boost your immunity and protect your body against bacteria. And according to experts, singing and driving can lead to a bunch of feel-good mental health effects, too. Here\u2019s how:\n\nIt can stimulate your mind and alleviate stress or depression symptoms.\n\nTomasz Zajda / EyeEm via Getty Images\n\nPsychologists have long known there are perks to singing, but more information is continuing to emerge: A global 2017 study of more than 1,700 choir members found that singing in a group improved a person\u2019s well-being because it created social connection and cognitive stimulation.\n\nKelley Kitley, a psychotherapist based in Chicago, said she has experienced the benefits firsthand. When she\u2019s transitioning from working with clients all day to coming home to her husband and four kids, she finds her daily practice of singing in the car to be an incredible stress release.\n\n\u201cIt used to be a ritual for me to home and pour a glass of wine,\u201d Kitley said. \u201cSo when I got sober six years ago, I needed to replace that with something positive. I love music and singing along, it totally energizes me.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not only made Kitley\u2019s solo commute more enjoyable, but car rides with the whole family have turned into a more relaxing experience. Plus, it provides a fun alternative for people who don\u2019t like meditating and other forms of stress management, she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s usually some discrepancy in song choice, but it\u2019s really fun,\u201d Kitley said. \u201cEspecially because we\u2019re in the car so much. I recommend it to my clients as much as I do yoga or meditation.\u201d\n\nConnie Omari, a licensed professional counselor practicing in North Carolina and owner of Tech Talk Therapy, said she also suggests singing and driving to her patients. The practice can be its own form of meditation and can help to quiet a racing mind.\n\n\u201cBy listening to music, drivers are permitted with an opportunity to replace negative thoughts with more positiveness through the use of rhythm and beats,\u201d she said. \u201cIt invites an opportunity to meditate.\u201d\n\nAnd because driving alone for long periods of time can have negative effects (some research has found it increases the risk of depression), Omari said singing and driving on a regular basis can help to slightly alleviate some of those issues.\n\n\u201cDriving is so mundane and routine for most people, that if left unchecked, the quietness of the ride can consume your thoughts,\u201d Omari said.\n\nMusic produces the feel-good hormones you get when you hug a loved one.\n\nKlaus Vedfelt via Getty Images\n\nAccording to Katie Ziskind, a licensed family therapist practicing in Connecticut, blasting music releases oxytocin, a chemical sometimes called the \u201clove hormone.\u201d Most people feel the effects of oxytocin when they\u2019re hugging someone or in the beginning stages of a romantic relationship. Oxytocin initiates emotions like trust, a sense of stability and even relaxation.\n\n\u201cIt boosts mood and uplifts mood,\u201d Ziskind said, adding that oxytocin isn\u2019t the only happy hormone that\u2019s released when you\u2019re blasting your favorite tunes. \u201cStudies have shown that simply thinking about listening to your favorite song, before you actually listen, releases serotonin, another feel-good chemical in your brain that reduces anxiety.\u201d\n\nDopamine released when you sing can reduce your road rage.\n\nMaartje Van Caspel / EyeEm via Getty Images\n\nIn addition to the other feel-good hormones mentioned above, you\u2019re also getting a hefty dose of dopamine when you\u2019re singing your favorite lyrics at the top of your lungs. According to Kristen Fuller, a physician and clinical mental health writer for Center For Discovery, a treatment center in California, dopamine is the kind of neurotransmitter you want if you face a lot of traffic during your commute, because it has an effect on your emotions, including by producing sensations of pleasure.\n\n\u201cDopamine boosts your motivation and drive,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cThis happy mood can result in less road rage and friendlier driving \u2014 which can potentially lead to less accidents.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurning up the music and singing as loud as humanly possible can improve the situation and make individuals happier when they arrive home and walk into work, which creates more positive environments around them for others,\u201d she added.\n\nSinging releases tension in your diaphragm more naturally than taking deep breaths.\n\nMint Images via Getty Images\n\nWhen you\u2019re stressed out, some general advice is to take long, deep breaths. But singing along to your favorite jam might be even better than inhaling and exhaling.\n\nLoretta G. Breuning, author of Habits of a Happy Brain: Retrain Your Brain to Boost Your Serotonin, Dopamine, Oxytocin, and Endorphin Levels and founder of the Inner Mammal Institute in California, said that singing actually relieves tension that can build up in your diaphragm. Tension happens when your body believes you\u2019re being threatened, even if the only danger is being late for work.\n\n\u201cShallow breathing is a common response to tension,\u201d Breuning said. \u201cIt can become a habit, and even though you\u2019re not doing it consciously, it reinforces the sense that you\u2019re threatened. Deeper breaths feel good, but natural ones feel better than forced ones. That\u2019s what singing does.\u201d\n\nNot only does this natural form of deep breathing make you feel immediately more relaxed, but you can still feel the effects at the end of the day. Diaphragmatic breathing \u2014 a fancy word for deep breathing \u2014 also improves your ability to sleep, said Kristen Ray, the vice president of behavioral health at Bayless Integreated Healthcare in Phoenix.\n\nSinging can help you with unprocessed emotions.\n\nDavid Bouchat via Getty Images\n\nEven if the song you\u2019re listening to happens to be a somber tune, it can still help you process your emotions in a healthy way. Depending on your mood, different kinds of music can feel almost therapeutic.\n\n\u201c[Singing] is a way for us to express emotions, especially difficult ones,\u201d Ray said. \u201cWhen we sing lyrics we can relate to and along with the artist, we feel less alone.\u201d\n\nMusic is emotionally evocative and helps bring up emotions you might have otherwise avoided for a long time, said Nick Hobson, director of science at the coaching service Psychology Compass.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for this exact reason why music therapy is showing promising results for helping people deal with anxiety, depression and PTSD,\u201d Hobson said.\n\nUltimately, belting out your favorite tune can be seen as a very basic way to practice self-care, according to Ashley Hampton, a licensed psychologist and entrepreneurial coach in Birmingham, Alabama.", "USA gymnasts are absolutely amazing! The team just won their fourth consecutive world title at the World Gymnastics Championships in Doha, Qatar.\n\nA key member of Team USA is Simone Biles, one of the best athletes of all time. Biles dominated during the competition (even after messing up, and even with a kidney stone!). She now has a vault named after her. Biles and her teammate, Morgan Hurd, the reigning all-around world champion, will go on to compete in the Women\u2019s All-Around finals this week.\n\nWhile these USA gymnasts are taking the world by storm, their sport\u2019s governing body, USA Gymnastics, is a complete and utter dumpster fire.\n\nOn the same day that the girls and women of USA Gymnastics won the Women\u2019s World Team Championship by their largest margin ever, the former president of USAG, Steve Penny, was in a Texas court pleading not guilty to charges of tampering with evidence related to the investigation of convicted serial sexual abuser and longtime USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar.\n\nWhat the hell is happening at USAG and who is going to fix it, for the sake of the athletes who compete under its banner and win gold medals doing it?\n\nThis juxtaposition \u2015 between the horror show that has been and continues to be the leadership around USAG, and the brilliance of the athletes who are the reason the organization exists at all \u2015 should give everyone pause and lead to a deep reflection on sporting culture in this country and the ways we protect our athletes. I won\u2019t hold my breath, though.\n\nIn March 2017, Penny resigned as the president of USA Gymnastics after 12 years. During his tenure, according to in-depth reporting by the Indianapolis Star, predatory coaches were allowed to work at different USA Gymnastics-certified gyms. Under Penny\u2019s leadership, USAG compiled a list of problematic coaches, then filed it away. And coaches who had been convicted of molesting children often never appeared on any lists of banned coaches.\n\nIt turns out there\u2019s a distinct possibility that Penny interfered directly in at least one investigation into Nassar\u2019s abuse. The indictment against Penny says that once he learned Texas law enforcement was looking into Nassar\u2019s conduct with gymnasts at the Karolyi ranch, he ordered the removal of documents relating to Nassar. Those documents are still missing.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nThe avalanche of poor leadership at USAG is continuing. Penny\u2019s arrest came shortly after the organization\u2019s interim president, Mary Bono, resigned after only four days on the job.\n\nBono didn\u2019t last long because Simone Biles drew attention to Bono\u2019s diss of Nike after the company announced its new advertising campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick, the NFL quarterback who took a knee on the sideline of NFL games during the national anthem in order to protest racial injustice (Nike sponsors Biles).\n\nBono had her brief position only because the former USAG president, Kerry Perry (who initially replaced Penny), resigned nine months into the job after the organization\u2019s hire of Mary Lee Tracy as elite development coordinator.\n\nLike Bono, Tracy lasted only days and quickly resigned under pressure after Olympian Aly Raisman tweeted her disappointment at the hire because of Tracy\u2019s support of Nassar, even after more than 50 athletes had come forward about abuse and he\u2019d been charged with sex crimes.\n\nUSAG has hired a consulting firm, Spencer Stuart, to conduct a search for the next president. But even this move is being questioned because, according to the Orange County Register, Spencer Stuart last year \u201crecommended a college president with a misdemeanor sexual abuse conviction at Ithaca College.\u201d\n\nWhat the hell is happening at USAG and who is going to fix it, for the sake of the athletes who compete by its rules and under its banner and win gold medals doing it?\n\nThe only people truly holding anyone accountable at this point are the gymnasts themselves and survivors.\n\nUSA Gymnastics is such a mess that there are calls for the United States Olympic Committee to decertify the organization altogether, a complicated but doable action. The USOC, though, is under scrutiny itself because gymnastics is not the only Olympic sport with a sexual abuse problem (see: swimming, speedskating, taekwondo, or volleyball), and the USOC has long failed to act on reports of abuse.\n\nCongress could do something about the USOC (and, in turn, USA Gymnastics), but it\u2019s hard to turn to Congress right now as a body we can trust to deal with reports of sexual violence. Following Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony and before the confirmation vote for now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Morgan McCaul, an 18-year-old gymnast who was abused by Nassar, came forward to say it was hard to wrap her mind around the fact that senators who vowed to clean up abuse in sports would also vote for Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cThat would invalidate my identity as a survivor,\u201d McCaul told ThinkProgress. \u201cIt is baffling on a moral level.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Michigan State (which also employed Nassar) is also a total mess post-Nassar, including the board of trustees and the current interim president, John Engler. Reports last year about problems in the football and basketball programs were met with some discussion (including my own addition), a lot of anger from fans, and little, if any, change (in fact, the new athletic director is an inside hire and coaches of both teams were supportive of that decision).\n\nThe NCAA has washed its hands, as it is wont to do. It\u2019s hard to see major fixes for gymnastics coming through collegiate influence.\n\nNike, which sponsors Michigan State in addition to Biles, said it is \u201cclosely monitoring events at Michigan State University\u201d when the company was asked by Lindsay Gibbs if it would pull out its contract with the school to support survivors\u2019 calls for Engler to be fired. (This is Nike\u2019s go-to answer on these things. See, most recently, its comments on the rape allegation against Cristiano Ronaldo.)\n\nThe only people holding anyone truly accountable at this point are the gymnasts and survivors, who continue to use their voices and their bodies to speak out. Some also are suing USAG, Michigan State and Nassar.\n\nWhile the USA gymnasts are taking the world by storm, their sport\u2019s governing body, USA Gymnastics, is a complete and utter dumpster fire.\n\nThe media \u2015 including reporters at Lansing State Journal, Detroit Free Press, and the Indianapolis Star; Lindsay Gibbs at ThinkProgress; Nancy Armour and Rachel Axon at USA Today; Dvora Meyers at Deadspin; and the podcasts Gymcastic and Believed \u2015 continue to investigate and report this story. Every once and a while, we get another glossy feature that tells us what these survivors have been through over the decades, and once more, their stories.\n\nThis is a story that involves the leadership of multiple major sports organizations and a top-level university enabling and even participating in criminal behavior, and a culture of sexual abuse that harms children and collegiate athletes. Unfortunately, except for a few moments during Nassar\u2019s trial and sentencing, this story is just a blip or a footnote for most of the major media.\n\nThe sports world needs a culture change that deals with emotional and mental abuse as part of its prevention of sexual abuse. As former gymnast Kristen DeCosta recently wrote, \u201cLarry Nassar is the result of years and years of verbal and physical abuse being normalized. Larry Nassar is the result of an entire sport working in the dark.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just gymnastics that needs this. Look at the other Olympic sports mentioned earlier, the University of Maryland\u2019s football team, or reports of emotional abuse in youth sports.\n\nSo, while we marvel at what Biles and the other American gymnasts are doing on the beams, bars, vault and floor, and cheer her and other survivors as they continue to put pressure on leadership and demand change, the truth is that it\u2019s not their job to do the latter, and they shouldn\u2019t have to.\n\nThe sports world should be deeply ashamed at the culture of sexual abuse and lack of accountability it has created and continues to defend. Someone needs to do something now \u2015 yesterday, in fact \u2015 but who? There\u2019s no one left to trust.", "It\u2019s open enrollment season again for Americans who shop on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance exchanges to buy coverage. It\u2019s a complicated, often confusing process for many people, especially those who may be using a health insurance exchange for the first time.\n\nHealth care \u2014 the ACA in particular \u2014 has been fodder for political debates this election year. But the ACA is still the law, and it still comes with benefits and responsibilities.\n\nHere are some basic facts about the exchanges, how they work, how to get financial help for insurance and how to find out about other options.\n\nHealth Insurance Exchanges\n\nThese marketplaces are intended for people who aren\u2019t offered health benefits from their employers and aren\u2019t enrolled in some other form of coverage, such as Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nThe exchanges are the primary way eligible people can apply for financial assistance to reduce their monthly insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs.\n\nSome exchanges are operated by states, others by the federal government and others by both levels. Residents of most states use HealthCare.gov or CuidadoDeSalud.gov, the Spanish-language version. The state-run exchange websites are listed here.\n\nOn these websites, people enter their personal and financial information to sign up for comparison-shopping of health insurance policies and benefits and to apply for subsidies. Those eligible for other government health care programs may be able to apply through an exchange, or the exchange may refer them to a state or federal agency.\n\nConsumers who can\u2019t access the internet or don\u2019t want to enroll online can do so by phone or in person. The phone number for people in HealthCare.gov states is (800) 318-2596, and the state-run exchanges have their own hotlines. Insurance agents and brokers, as well as other enrollment counselors, can help people in person, and none of them charge consumers for that assistance.\n\nBecause of large budget cuts imposed by the Trump administration, however, there will be many fewer counselors available to consumers who use the federal exchanges this year, making it crucial for customers who want help to act before there is a rush near the deadline. State-run health insurance exchanges have not instituted similar cuts.\n\nShoppers using some online insurance brokers or buying directly from some insurance providers can bypass HealthCare.gov and apply for coverage and financial assistance directly with those companies. These websites may not include all the policies available on the health insurance exchanges, however, but they may include plans not sold on the exchanges, as well as alternative forms of coverage. Participating brokers include eHealth, GetInsured, GoHealth and Health Sherpa. A handful of insurers, such as Centene and Oscar Health, also offer this service.\n\nDeadlines To Enroll\n\nThe deadlines for enrolling in a health insurance plan for next year are different from last year in some states, and consumers in most states have less time than they did in previous years, so start your shopping and application process as early as possible.\n\nOn the federally run health insurance exchanges accessed via HealthCare.gov in 39 states, open enrollment begins Nov. 1 and ends Dec. 15. Residents of the following states with federal exchanges must enroll before the end of that period:\n\nAlabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nThe state-run exchanges in Connecticut, Idaho, Maryland, Vermont and Washington have the same enrollment period, Nov. 1 to Dec. 15.\n\nOpen enrollment also begins Nov. 1 at the remainder of the state-run exchanges (except California, where sign-ups began Oct. 15), but the end date varies:\n\nCalifornia: Jan. 15\n\nColorado: Jan. 15\n\nDistrict of Columbia: Jan. 31\n\nMassachusetts: Jan. 23\n\nMinnesota: Jan. 13\n\nNew York: Jan. 31\n\nRhode Island: Dec. 31\n\nIn states with final deadlines in January, people who want their health insurance to be in place at the beginning of the year must enroll during December; those deadlines vary by state. Policies selected in January won\u2019t be active until February.\n\nAfter those deadlines pass, you can\u2019t purchase exchange-eligible health insurance until the next open enrollment period, except under special circumstances, such as having a baby or moving. Other types of coverage, such as short-term policies, may be available at other times.\n\nThe Individual Mandate\n\nAs part of the tax bill President Donald Trump signed into law last December, the fines some people owed in past years if they did not have health coverage will be repealed in most states in 2019.\n\nBut residents of Massachusetts, New Jersey and the District of Columbia will still be liable for penalties if they do not obtain health coverage. Fines and exceptions differ in those states. Vermont will impose an individual mandate and penalties in 2020.\n\nFinancial Assistance\n\nThe ACA offers two kinds of subsidy, both linked to household income.\n\nThe first is premium tax credits, offered to anyone using a health insurance exchange who has an income ranging from the federal poverty level to four times that amount, or about $12,000 to about $49,000 for a single person. The federal government sends the money directly to the health insurance company, and the policyholder pays the difference between the subsidy and the full price of the insurance. Tax credits may not be used for catastrophic plans, insurance policies that are available only outside an exchange or other types of coverage like short-term plans.\n\nThe second type of help is cost-sharing reductions, which lessen the amount a person pays out of pocket for health care by doing things like shrinking the deductible and any co-payments required by the insurance company. These are available to people with incomes between the poverty level and 250 percent of poverty, or about $12,000 to about $30,000. Cost-sharing reductions are available only for plans sold on a health insurance exchange. In addition, consumers must choose a midrange Silver plan to receive this subsidy.\n\nLast year Trump stopped reimbursing health insurance companies that provide these cost-sharing reductions. But the law still requires insurers to reduce cost sharing for eligible consumers. The insurance companies aren\u2019t getting paid, but the subsidies didn\u2019t go away.\n\nHealth Insurance \u2018Metal Tiers\u2019\n\nThere are four main types of health insurance plans sold on the exchanges: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. There are also high-deductible catastrophic plans mainly available to people younger than 30.\n\nAs the metal names indicate, the plans tend to get more generous and more expensive as you go from Bronze to Platinum. The big difference is how much out-of-pocket spending policyholders must do before most of their benefits kick in. That\u2019s calculated using what\u2019s called actuarial value, which is a way of estimating what percentage of a typical person\u2019s medical costs the insurance pays and how much the patient pays. The metal tiers in general break down like this:\n\nBronze: 60 percent of medical costs paid by the insurer\n\nSilver: 70 percent of medical costs paid by the insurer\n\nGold: 80 percent of medical costs paid by the insurer\n\nPlatinum: 90 percent of medical costs paid by the insurer\n\nCatastrophic plans have an actuarial value that\u2019s almost the same as that for Bronze plans, but premiums often are lower because only those younger than 30 may buy them (with limited exceptions), and younger people tend to be healthier.\n\nPremium Increases\n\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news about health insurance exchange plan rates for 2019. The good news is that the average price of benchmark plans \u2015 the second-cheapest Silver plan in each geographic area \u2015 is 2 percent lower than it was this year, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services on the 39 states that use the federal exchanges. The prices for these plans are used to calculate the size of the subsidies available to people who qualify, so it\u2019s a good measure of premiums overall. The average unsubsidized monthly premium for benchmark plans is $405, down from $412 in 2018.\n\nSubsidized customers will pay less, often significantly less, depending on their incomes. About 80 percent of people who qualify for premium tax credits will be able to find plans that cost $50 to $100 a month, according to Get America Covered, which promotes health insurance enrollment.\n\nThe bad news is that although unsubsidized premiums are slightly down for next year, prices are still high because the increases insurers imposed in previous years were so large. Average benchmark premiums are 85 percent higher than they were for 2014, the first year the exchanges were open. In the first few years, insurers miscalculated how expensive their customers would be and didn\u2019t charge enough to cover their costs. After large rate hikes for 2018, insurers became more profitable, making additional large increases this year unnecessary overall.\n\nSince exchange enrollment began in 2013, affordability has been a major concern, especially for those who qualify for little or no financial assistance. Health insurance companies initially anticipated a healthy, less expensive pool of customers. But the medical costs of those who enrolled were higher than expected, leading insurers to raise rates.\n\nThese averages and general trends, however, mask a great deal of variation among markets. Some customers will see premium decreases, while others will see large increases. Statewide average premiums for benchmark plans tell part of the story. The highest is in Wyoming, at $709 a month, and the lowest is in Indiana at $280.\n\nThere are more insurance companies participating in the federal exchanges this year, which means more choice for some consumers, although insurers exited some markets. In federal exchange states, 155 insurers are selling policies for 2019, up from 132 this year. That\u2019s still fewer than in 2014, when 187 companies participated. There are five states \u2015 Alaska, Delaware, Mississippi, Nebraska and Wyoming \u2015 with only a single carrier on their exchanges for 2019, down from eight this year.\n\nExchange customers need to shop around to find the best deals, even if they\u2019re satisfied with their current plans and would like to keep them. The best bargain for 2018 won\u2019t necessarily be the best bargain for next year.\n\nConsumers who qualify for tax credits to reduce their premiums are mostly shielded from premium increases because the subsidies rise to cover the additional cost. More than 80 percent of exchange customers receive these subsidies.\n\nBut people who earn too much for financial assistance must bear the full cost. For those consumers, better deals may be available from insurance companies that offer other policies off the exchanges. These policies can be reviewed at insurance company websites and through insurance brokers.\n\nAnother complicating factor relates to the Trump administration\u2019s halting of payments to insurance companies with customers who receive cost-sharing reductions. In order to make up for the lost revenue, insurers in most states applied much larger premium increases to Silver plans for this year and next year, because those are the plans that people eligible for cost-sharing reductions must buy.\n\nFor those who earn too much for that benefit \u2015 whether they get subsidies for their premiums or not \u2015 that means that Gold plans will sometimes be cheaper than Silver plans. As a result, consumers might be able to get more generous coverage at a comparable price. For subsidy-eligible customers, higher Silver prices mean bigger subsidies, which people may be able to use to get Bronze plans for little to no cost.\n\nMedicaid, CHIP And The Basic Health Program\n\nDepending on your income and other factors, you or the children in your household may qualify for Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Generally, the federal-state programs are intended for low-income individuals and families. In most states, there is no monthly cost, and out-of-pocket expenses are limited.\n\nThe eligibility criteria vary by state and usually are different for the categories of people who may enroll in Medicaid or CHIP. Those include children, parents, pregnant women, people with disabilities and elderly nursing home patients. Children in families with incomes as high as four times the poverty level (about $83,000 for a family of three) may enroll in one of these programs, depending on the rules in their home states. In states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, adults who qualify under older criteria (such as pregnant women, parents or people with disabilities) must have lower incomes to qualify.\n\nThe ACA called for a Medicaid expansion across the nation to open up the program to all working-age adults, including those with no children, who earn up to 133 percent of the poverty level (about $16,000 for a single person). But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could refuse the Medicaid expansion.\n\nExpanded Medicaid is available in 33 states, including Virginia, which adopted the policy this year and is accepting applications beginning Nov. 1. Maine voters approved a ballot initiative last year to expand the program, but it has not gone into effect yet. In Maine and the 17 states that have not expanded Medicaid, people with incomes below the poverty level are ineligible for subsidies to make private health insurance less expensive.\n\nSome states use different names for Medicaid and CHIP. In Wisconsin, for example, Medicaid is BadgerCare, and in Vermont, CHIP is called Dr. Dynasaur.\n\nIn Minnesota and New York, residents with incomes up to twice the poverty level (about $24,000 for a single person), may be eligible to enroll in the ACA\u2019s Basic Health Program. These benefits are called MinnesotaCare and, in New York, the Essential Plan. No other states have opted to create these programs.\n\nAlternative Coverage Options\n\nThe Trump administration has prioritized making other types of coverage more available to consumers who don\u2019t want to use a health insurance exchange or can\u2019t find policies they consider affordable.\n\nMost significantly, the federal government has relaxed the rules governing the sale of so-called short-term, limited-duration plans. Previously, short-term plans could be issued for no more than three months; now they may last up to 364 days.\n\nThese policies do not have to meet the ACA\u2019s standards for included benefits, and insurers are permitted to reject people with pre-existing conditions, charge them more than healthier people or refuse to provide coverage for specific medical needs. They might not include coverage for services like prescription drugs, mental health or pregnancy.\n\nBecause of the skimpier benefits and fewer costly sick customers, people with healthy medical histories may be able to find plans that are less expensive than policies sold on the exchanges or ACA-compliant policies sold off the exchanges.\n\nThose savings on premiums come at a cost, however, in the form of less coverage and greater exposure to uncovered medical costs. In addition, insurers may refuse to renew these policies at the end of their term on the basis of customers\u2019 health.\n\nThese deregulated short-term plans aren\u2019t available everywhere. California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Oregon prohibit them.\n\nThis is an updated version of an article originally published on Nov. 1, 2017.", "Had a hell of a night in Fort Myers. This man apologized for giving me the finger at a rally earlier this year in Tampa. Really.

These actions are often encouraged by the president himself.\n\nAcosta has shared footage from inside the press area at these events, including the July rally in Tampa. The man who apologized can be seen giving Acosta the finger at 10 seconds and again at 25 seconds:\n\nJust a sample of the sad scene we faced at the Trump rally in Tampa.

They then drove him two hours from Homestead, the immigrant children\u2019s shelter where he had been staying since May, to The Broward Transitional Center, an adult detention facility in Pompano Beach, Florida.\n\nOnce Roberto \u2014 a pseudonym HuffPost is using to protect his identity \u2014 arrived, he changed into an orange jumpsuit and entered the jail with guards standing at every exit and bunk beds for the almost 600 men inside. He was imprisoned, despite having a relative who had applied to sponsor him.\n\nLisa Lehner, an attorney at Americans For Immigrant Justice (AIJ) who worked on Roberto\u2019s case, says she sees teenagers aging out of shelters and being transferred to adult detention in record numbers, due to the government\u2019s recent crackdown on sponsors.\n\nAlmost four months earlier, Roberto\u2019s California-based uncle had applied to sponsor him so they could live together. But throughout that time, Lehner says the government failed to process his uncle\u2019s fingerprints before Roberto turned 18, a situation that Lehner says has become increasingly common because of a backlogged system.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous for it to take 100 days for someone\u2019s fingerprints to run,\u201d said Lehner. \u201c[And] it\u2019s unconscionable that ICE is violating clear federal law and taking [teenagers] to the most restrictive setting as opposed to the least restrictive setting.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Happy Birthday, We\u2019re Sending You To Prison\u2019\u201d\n\nSince June, when the government made the process of vetting sponsors more arduous, multiple legal groups told HuffPost that the number of 18-year-old clients who are sent to ICE detention on their birthdays has increased, and in the case of a few organizations, at least doubled.\n\nThe new standards, which require all sponsors and everyone in their households to be fingerprinted as part of a background check, mean application processing times have ballooned from under a month to two or three months and that children are now spending a record amount of time in detention. In addition, advocates say fewer sponsors are coming forward in the first place, since ICE is now more involved in the vetting process and has begun using information from applications to arrest undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe recent increase in teenagers being sent to adult detention reflects a larger trend: Between 2014 and 2017, the percentage of immigrants aging out of children\u2019s shelters almost tripled to approximately 250 kids \u2015 a number that has almost certainly gone up now that the number of detained children has reached an all-time high of 12,300. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) said in an email that the agency\u2019s 2018 data is not yet available.\n\nYet despite a federal law stating that ICE should place these immigrants in the \u201cleast restrictive setting\u201d possible, lawyers from the National Immigrant Justice Center have accused immigration officers of sending teenagers straight to adult detention in a recent lawsuit.\n\nIn an email, an ORR representative told HuffPost that the agency would not \u201cspeculate and has no specific data to confirm this theory\u201d that increased vetting has led to more age-outs. When HuffPost asked ICE about whether it was sending 18-year-olds straight to adult detention in violation of federal law, a representative responded that \u201c18-year-olds are not minors.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurning 18 is sort of a coming-of-age ritual,\u201d said Holly Cooper, co-director of the immigration law clinic at The University of California, Davis. \u201cBut for these children, it\u2019s \u2018Happy Birthday, we\u2019re sending you to prison.\u2019 It\u2019s just a very inhumane process that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Nervous Every Time A Client Turns 18\u201d\n\nNadir worries that when he turns 18 on Nov. 4, he\u2019ll be shackled and sent to ICE detention. After the teenager, whose real identity HuffPost is protecting with a pseudonym, fled violence in India and was sent to an Arizona shelter at the end of July, a family friend offered to sponsor him. But according to his lawyer, ORR told the sponsor there likely wouldn\u2019t be enough time to process his fingerprints in the three months before Nadir turned 18.\n\nCasey Frank, an attorney from the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project who is representing Nadir, says her client repeatedly asks, \u201cWhat will happen on my birthday?\u201d But Nadir won\u2019t find out until Nov. 4 whether ICE will release him or put him in adult detention \u2015 and Frank worries it will be the latter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m nervous every time a client turns 18,\u201d Frank said. \u201cIt\u2019s my worst nightmare.\u201d\n\nHer colleague, Golden McCarthy, says no bureaucratic issue should stand in the way of keeping a child safe. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a concern that the sponsor is a danger to the child and there isn\u2019t a concern that there is trafficking,\u201d said the children\u2019s program director at the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project. \u201cTo have such severe consequences happen to this young man is disconcerting.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) claims the new policies will keep children safe from traffickers, but experts say they are unnecessary additions to the existing security measures. Non-parental sponsors were already required to submit fingerprints and extensive documentation before the new policy was implemented, and ORR staff often visit the homes of potential sponsors to check the conditions. Lawyers say that instead of protecting kids, increased vetting causes unnecessary delays that further traumatize children.\n\n\u201cThis is just another form of family separation,\u201d said Lehner. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping children from their parents and [relatives] for an unjustified period of time and what are we vetting here? The parents aren\u2019t harming anyone ... it\u2019s just unreasonable.\u201d\n\nLehner says there\u2019s no proof that the new policies keep kids safer, yet the negative effects of child detention are well-documented.\n\n\u201cYou are transferred in handcuffs to a facility that\u2019s a prison and there\u2019s no one in your peer group, no relatives and no family who you can relate to,\u201d Lehner said. \u201cIt\u2019s just continuing trauma with no real respite.\u201d\n\nThe Nightmare Of Adult Detention\n\nLast August, Paula cried in the back of the truck while ICE officers drove her to an adult detention facility in Texas on her 18th birthday. She was terrified, and those fears were well-founded. At the facility, she recalls sleeping on a bunk bed in a big area with 30 other women who were older than her and constantly fighting with one another. The guards would aggressively insult her and the other inmates, saying they were \u201cgood for nothing,\u201d and she says the food was always cold and undercooked. Paula saw women cutting themselves, and at times, thought of doing the same.\n\n\u201cI would ask myself, \u2018What was it that I had done to suffer like this?\u2019\u201d said Paula, a pseudonym HuffPost is using to protect her identity. \u201cThere were times I would think about wanting to hurt myself because I felt so alone.\u201d\n\nPaula says being in adult detention was a brutal contrast to the children\u2019s shelter she had left, where she slept in a room with one another girl, had friends her age, and easy access to social workers and nurses.\n\nExperts say that in addition to a lack of peer and professional support, it\u2019s also harder for 18-year-olds to win their asylum cases from adult detention. They aren\u2019t given presentations about their legal rights, cannot easily communicate with lawyers and are no longer eligible for the same legal protections as a minor.\n\n\u201c(ICE) custody is a much more punitive situation,\u201d said Jennifer Podkul, the director of policy for Kids In Need Of Defense (KIND). \u201cWe\u2019re putting these kids, who are already having a hard time explaining their story, [in adult detention] and making it much harder for them.\u201d\n\nLawyers are concerned that the new vetting requirements are explicitly designed to keep children detained for longer periods to dissuade them from staying in the U.S.\n\nGolden said she\u2019s seen her 18-year-old clients become so desperate in adult detention that they\u2019ve thought about returning to places where they fled extreme violence.\n\nRochelle Garza, a Texas-based immigration attorney, believes the government deliberately creates policies that will put more teenagers in prison, precisely because of its traumatic effects.\n\n\u201cMost kids I represented who turned 18, they cannot psychologically or emotionally handle being in prison,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they end up requesting voluntary departure or bond removal from the country.\u201d", "White House counselor Kellyanne Conway once famously stated that the lies propagated by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration were actually \u201calternative facts.\u201d So on Wednesday, when she tweeted the hashtag #FactsFirst in praise of Fox News topping October\u2019s cable news ratings, she was ridiculed online:", "Trick-or-treaters were in for a surprise when they stopped by Rep.

Monang Sitompul told local TV an object believed to be the aircraft\u2019s fuselage was also seen on the seafloor.\n\nThe device recovered by divers is the flight data recorder and the search for the cockpit voice recorder continues, said Bambang Irawan, an investigator with the National Transport Safety Commission.\n\n\u201cWe will process the data contained in this FDR as part of the investigation process to find out the cause of the crash,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot say how long it takes to process data in a black box, but of course we will try as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe location of the find was about 500 meters (yards) northwest of the coordinates where the plane lost contact and at a depth of 30 meters, said search and rescue agency head Muhammad Syaugi.\n\n\u201cThe currents below the sea are still strong which make it difficult for divers, but they persistently face it,\u201d he said.\n\nData from flight-tracking sites show the plane had erratic speed and altitude in the early minutes of a flight on Sunday and on its fatal flight Monday. Safety experts caution, however, that the data must be checked for accuracy against the flight data recorder.\n\nSeveral passengers on the Sunday flight from Bali to Jakarta have recounted problems that included a long-delayed takeoff for an engine check and terrifying descents in the first 10 minutes in the air.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The flight recorder, which was found by search teams on the sea floor, will be examined by the National Transportation Safety Committee.\n\nLion Air has ordered 50 of the MAX 8 planes and one of its subsidiary airlines was last year the first to operate the new generation jet.\n\nInvestigators say a preliminary report into the accident could be released within a month but complete findings will take several months more.\n\nThe Lion Air crash is the worst airline disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died on a Garuda flight near Medan.

According to The Wall Street Journal, there will be more troops deployed to the border than there are currently serving in Iraq and Syria.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter whether the deployment was a political stunt, Mattis pointed out the additional troops were a request from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\n\u201cThe support that we provide to the secretary of Homeland Security is tactical support based on the request from the commissioner of customs and border police,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cSo we don\u2019t do stunts in this department, thank you.\u201d\n\nMany Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border.

The caravan originated in San Pedro Sula in Honduras, which has earned a reputation of being one of the most violent places in Central America.\n\nThe caravan is still weeks from reaching the U.S. border.\n\nEarlier this week, Kevin McAleenan, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, also denied that deploying the troops was a politically motivated decision.", "Rodrigo Abd/Associated Press Honduran girls hug while waiting in line for a chance to play on the playground at a camp set up by a caravan of thousands of Central American migrants in Juchitan, Mexico, on Wednesday.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump recently tweeted that the migrant caravan of over 5,000 Central Americans is made up of some \u201cvery bad thugs and gang members,\u201d a handful of immigration experts and advocates told HuffPost that\u2019s not the case.\n\nThe reality, some experts said, is that the caravan is full of children who have embarked on a physically and mentally grueling trip to escape life-threatening situations in Central America. About half of the estimated 4,000 people in the caravan are children, ranging in age from 1-month-old babies to teenagers.\n\nThe more than two-week-long journey, which has reached southern Mexico, has at times involved walking for up to seven hours in 104-degree temperatures without access to clean water. The migrants are forced to sleep on the ground and don\u2019t have enough blankets.\n\nThe trek has left children dehydrated, faint and sick, according to advocates and pediatricians. The group is so exhausted that on Wednesday they paused for the day in Juchitan, a city in southern Mexico, to rest and in hopes that buses would take them to Mexico City.\n\n\u201cThese are human beings,\u201d said Alex Mensing, an organizer for Pueblo Sin Fronteras, the immigration rights group that organized the caravan. \u201cThe children on the caravan don\u2019t know what a border means.\u201d\n\nMensing and others told HuffPost that Trump\u2019s use of the migrant caravan as a political weapon \u2015 including the announcement that he\u2019ll send 5,200 military troops to the border \u2015 ignores the real-life suffering of vulnerable kids.\n\n\u2018They Can Die\u2019\n\nManuel Valenzuela, an El Paso-based pediatrician who is volunteering with the caravan, said his biggest concern is the spread of infectious disease \u2015 something that can easily happen in large groups with limited access to hygiene.\n\nMigrants who sleep on pavement often don\u2019t have easy access to showers, and until recently, when human rights organizations delivered supplies, they didn\u2019t have soap or hand sanitizer readily available, Valenzuela said. Because there aren\u2019t enough doctors traveling with the group to treat thousands of people, a mass outbreak of illness could be fatal for children and elders, who have weaker immune systems.\n\n\u201cThey can die,\u201d Valenzuela said. \u201cThe chances to have, you know, many children very sick are very high.\u201d\n\nValenzuela has been focusing on preventative measures, such as using a megaphone to remind people to wash their hands. So far, he said, he hasn\u2019t seen anyone with a critical health condition.\n\nStill, he said, children are suffering from gastrointestinal diseases (causing fevers, diarrhea and vomiting); dehydration, which has led to fainting; and bronchitis, which has made it hard for children to breathe.\n\nTwo children have been hospitalized this week.\n\nOn Monday, Valenzuela said doctors took a 4-month-old with bronchitis to the hospital. On Tuesday, Ver\u00f3nica Abreu Rivera, a project assistant for the Institute for Women in Migration, said a 15-year-old was taken to the hospital with a cardiac issue.\n\nAn Arduous Journey\n\nMany of the children\u2019s health problems stem from walking or being carried by their parents for hours at a time under the beating sun.\n\nMensing said the caravan tries to leave its camp at 3 a.m. to avoid the heat, but temperatures can still often rise above 90 degrees quickly.\n\nSome advocates who traveled with the caravan told HuffPost that for most of the journey, migrants have not had steady access to clean water, meaning the children either drank contaminated water that made them ill or they became dehydrated. (Last week, UNICEF dropped off 20,000 liters of safe drinking water.)\n\nCarlos Mendoza, the content manager at Amnesty International Americas, recalled watching a barefoot toddler faint while holding his mother\u2019s hand in Tapachula, a city in southern Mexico.\n\nMendoza said the mother quickly picked up her son and started to fan him with her hands. He said he watched another small child faint in the back of a crowded truck while an adult rushed to splash the child\u2019s face with water.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw is people in despair,\u201d Mendoza said of the four days he spent with the caravan. \u201cThey were distressed and in the heat.\u201d\n\nRocio Nu\u00f1ez, the media manager for UNICEF in Mexico, said last week she met a mother who fled gang violence in Honduras with her two kids, one of whom has Down syndrome and a heart condition.\n\nThe 15-year-old was struggling to keep pace with the group, and Nu\u00f1ez said the mother sent her older son ahead to see if the next destination had food and shelter. She also tried to get a lift from locals driving in the same direction, according to Nu\u00f1ez.\n\nOthers said many parents have tried to find their children a ride to make the journey easier.\n\nBut that comes with its own dangers: According to local news reports, a 22-year-old and a 35-year-old have died falling off of trucks.\n\nOn top of the physical concerns, some doctors worry about how the caravan is affecting the children\u2019s mental health.\n\nPediatrician Julie Linton, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, said children who have already been traumatized by violence back home are often re-traumatized by their journey to the U.S.\n\n\u201cThey are facing extreme stress,\u201d she said, adding that their parents are often too preoccupied with logistics to provide them with the emotional support they need to feel safe.\n\nStill, Linton said, although the caravan can be a harrowing experience, most children are fleeing even more dangerous situations that involve gang or domestic violence.\n\n\u201cFamilies are not making a decision to take an incredibly harrowing and dangerous journey lightly,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are not choosing to flee their country [by] choice, but because they are trying to create a safe and hopefully better future for their children.\u201d", "Jared Younger said that when his sister contacted him, he had a feeling it was about his father.

Multiple news outlets have reported that Fotios \u201cFreddy\u201d Geas, who has mob ties, is one of the suspects. Bulger\u2019s fame, status as an informant, advanced age and health issues made him a vulnerable target, four prison bureau employees said.\n\n\u201cThey screwed up. I don\u2019t know who picked Hazelton \u2015 it\u2019s one of our most violent institutions,\u201d said Joe Rojas, the union president for correctional staff at Coleman, a penitentiary in Sumter County, Florida. Bulger had been incarcerated at Coleman for four years until his transfer to Oklahoma\u2019s Federal Transfer Center on Oct. 23 and his subsequent arrival at Hazelton.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last place you want to send a high-profile inmate,\u201d Rojas said of Hazelton.\n\n\u201cSending him there is like a death sentence. It\u2019s like going on death row,\u201d he added.\n\nThe administration is directly responsible for Whitey Bulger. You can\u2019t run the prisons on the cheap, and that\u2019s what we have \u2015 executive staff running prisons on the cheap. Eric Young, national president of the Council of Prison Locals\n\nRick Heldreth, the union president for correctional staff at Hazelton, cited two other murders and estimated there were over 200 violent incidents at the facility so far this year. He said he thinks the violence is only getting worse due to understaffing.\n\nJust five days before Bulger\u2019s death, lawmakers including Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the staffing issues at Hazelton and other federal prisons in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. They had been raising concerns about Hazelton for the last year, according to Eric Young, the national president of the Council of Prison Locals.\n\nEleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting delegate in Congress for Washington, D.C., also called for an investigation earlier this month into the unsafe conditions at Hazelton.\n\n\u201cMr. Bulger is a result of the staffing problems of the facility,\u201d Young said. \u201cUnfortunately, I truly believe because of the staffing shortages officers can\u2019t be everywhere they need to be. And the result is a dead inmate.\u201d\n\nBased on documents reviewed by HuffPost, Bulger had been disciplined at Coleman before his transfer for threatening a staff member this spring. But BOP employees said they didn\u2019t know why he was ultimately transferred.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons declined to disclose the reason why Bulger was transferred, per BOP policy.\n\nColeman, unlike Hazelton, is known for being in the \u201ctriangle\u201d of safe prisons for someone like Bulger, Rojas said. He explained that Coleman and U.S. penitentiaries in Terre Haute, Indiana, and Tucson, Arizona \u2015 where Bulger resided prior to his transfer four years ago to Coleman \u2015 are considered \u201cdrop-out\u201d prisons that provide a safe environment for people who might be targets in a normal prison \u2015 places for \u201csnitches, for high-profile inmates, and for people that drop out of gangs,\u201d Rojas said.\n\nBulger could be considered all three: He had served as an FBI informant, was on the Ten Most Wanted List and informed on gangs.\n\nIt\u2019s ludicrous anyone would even consider sending Bulger to Hazelton from a prison like Coleman that\u2019s within the \u201ctriangle,\u201d a correctional officer who has worked in two penitentiaries and who requested anonymity to protect his job told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cOur yard is a very violent yard,\u201d Heldreth said of Hazelton. \u201cWhy he ended up in general population, given his history .\u2026 Obviously, the agency knows what type of inmates we house at this facility and their background. It\u2019s pretty surprising.\u201d\n\n\u201cHim being killed does not surprise me one bit, because of the lack of staffing [at Hazelton] and he\u2019s been labeled a snitch,\u201d the correctional officer said. \u201cThe old saying is \u2018snitches get stitches and end up in ditches.\u2019 I guarantee, whoever killed him, it\u2019s a huge badge of honor to take him out.\u201d\n\nWhile no one knows why Bulger was transferred, Rojas believes it may have had to do with friction between the inmate and a female supervisor. According to Rojas, Bulger told the supervisor this spring: \u201cYour day of reckoning is coming.\u201d\n\nPrison documents (shared with HuffPost by a staffer who asked to remain anonymous for fear of losing their job) confirm that Bulger was sentenced to 30 days in solitary confinement for threatening staff. Those documents showed that Bulger remained in special housing \u2015 where he only got an hour of yard time and lost all his privileges \u2015 for six months until he was transferred.\n\nBut that still leaves questions unanswered. Rojas said an inmate would typically be sent back to regular housing once the 30 days were up. And nothing explains why Bulger was sent to Hazelton after his extended time in the special housing unit.\n\nThe old saying is \u2018snitches get stitches and end up in ditches.\u2019 I guarantee, whoever killed him, it\u2019s a huge badge of honor to take him out. Correctional officer who requested anonymity\n\nAll of the Bureau of Prisons employees HuffPost interviewed also blamed the violence on ongoing staffing shortages at Hazelton \u2015 and federal prisons across the country.\n\nThe Trump administration is currently looking to cut up to 14 percent of prison jobs throughout the BOP \u2015 some 6,000 positions \u2015 many of which were already vacant. Cutting positions papers over the decrease in staff, Young and other employees told HuffPost. Those staffing shortages mean that teachers and other prison workers are being called upon to execute correctional officers\u2019 responsibilities, The New York Times first reported this summer.\n\nA BOP spokesperson said the staffing levels at Hazelton are commensurate with staffing at BOP prisons across the country. Which is exactly the problem, Young said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a serious problem, and it\u2019s not only Hazelton \u2015 this is system-wide,\u201d Young argued. \u201cThe administration is directly responsible for Whitey Bulger. You can\u2019t run the prisons on the cheap and that\u2019s what we have \u2015 executive staff running prisons on the cheap.\u201d\n\nHazelton is down 77 positions, 42 of them for correctional officers, Hazelton union president Heldreth told HuffPost. Heldreth believes the staffing issues are to blame for the uptick in violence. Since the facility opened in 2004, he said, the prison usually averaged one murder a year, not three. And violent incidents now occur almost daily.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting worse and worse,\u201d Heldreth said. More staff would mean more supervision, more checks on inmates, more chances to stop assaults or confiscate contraband. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see anyone else die.\u201d\n\nWhich is exactly what Young thinks will happen if the staffing levels don\u2019t change.\n\n\u201cI can almost guarantee before we turn the new year, there will be other inmates killed at that place,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had this many inmates killed in that short a period of time.\u201d\n\nHeldreth says an official told him that staffing levels should return to 100 percent following Bulger\u2019s murder, but he says he\u2019s heard that before.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful this will have an impact on them and shame them into [doing what] we need to do.\u201d", "Trevor Noah, host of \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d says he feels very uncomfortable to be in Florida on Halloween.\n\n\u201cBecause of \u2018Stand your ground\u2019 laws, I don\u2019t know how anyone can enjoy Halloween in Florida,\u201d Noah said on his Wednesday show, filmed in Miami. \u201cNo, because the law is that someone can shoot you if you frighten them.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the whole point of Halloween.

I don\u2019t get why you keep doing this?

King, whose career in broadcast television spans 40 years, accepted the honor during a ceremony in New York City on Monday.\n\nAfter Winfrey delivered a powerful speech \u2015 touching on feminism, sexual harassment and the power of the press \u2015 at the Golden Globe Awards in January, people ramped up speculation that the media mogul might be gearing up for a presidential campaign.\n\nBut Winfrey and King shut down those rumors even before the speech, saying in an interview with InStyle weeks before the Golden Globes that the former talk-show host was not interested in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that interests me, I don\u2019t have the DNA for it,\u201d Winfrey told the magazine.\n\nIn that same interview, Winfrey revealed that King was persistent at raising the issue with her.\n\n\u201cGayle \u2015 who knows me as well as I know myself practically \u2015 has been calling me regularly and texting me things, like a woman in the airport saying, \u2018When\u2019s Oprah going to run?\u2019\u201d Winfrey told InStyle. \u201cSo Gayle sends me these things, and then she\u2019ll go, \u2018I know, I know, I know!

Trump will return to Florida on Saturday night, to Pensacola, which, like Fort Myers, is solidly Republican turf.\n\nTrump\u2019s prediction of DeSantis\u2019 and Scott\u2019s victories notwithstanding, one longtime Republican consultant believes Trump\u2019s political team\u2019s decision to devote two visits to Florida in the final week speaks volumes.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is coming to Florida twice in the last six days,\u201d said Mac Stipanovich, a chief of staff to one former GOP governor and campaign manager for two. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing that because it\u2019s in the bag.\u201d\n\nMost public opinion polls have shown Gillum with a small but consistent lead since the start of the general election campaign in late August.

You\u2019re in a crouch,\u201d Stipanovich said.\n\nDeSantis was largely unknown outside the congressional district he represented until Trump endorsed him on Twitter before he even officially announced his candidacy for governor. He won almost entirely because of Trump\u2019s support and has been hoping for as much direct help from Trump as possible during the general election.\n\nBut Scott had made sure to keep some distance from Trump all year. He avoided attending Trump\u2019s rally for DeSantis in July and had planned to skip this one, as well, but eventually altered his plans to attend.\n\nScott was thought to have a strong chance of unseating Nelson until this summer. That\u2019s when coastal areas near Fort Myers on the Gulf of Mexico and Stuart on the Atlantic Ocean were hit by toxic blue-green algae from Lake Okeechobee. Scott has been criticized for favoring business development over Florida\u2019s fragile environment, and many blamed the algae bloom on environmental neglect.\n\nAssociated Press President Donald Trump came to Florida to back Rick Scott's bid for the Senate.\n\nThat bloom then appeared to feed an ongoing red tide outbreak on Florida\u2019s west coast, possibly exacerbating it but certainly giving Democrats an attack line. Scott faced protests late this summer at campaign stops in Fort Myers and Venice \u2013 both Republican strongholds. He largely stopped coastal campaign visits as the red tide spread up Florida\u2019s East Coast, and then he stopped campaigning altogether after Hurricane Michael struck the Panhandle last month.\n\nAs has become routine in his recent campaign speeches, Trump delivered a large number of falsehoods about his record and that of Democrats in his remarks Wednesday.\n\nAmong them: That he had already started building a border wall with nearly $5 billion in funding thus far; that he had been able to push through a law giving veterans the ability to see private doctors; and that the formal name of the Democratic Party is the \u201cDemocrat\u201d party.\n\nIn reality, Congress has not provided even a single dollar for construction of the \u201cGreat Wall\u201d Trump promised to build during his campaign.

Each time, the filing said, he made clear that he was the only person who could help her become an actress.\n\nA few years later, when Doe said she was dating a wealthy man, Weinstein got possessive and chastised her for being unavailable for him sexually, the filing said. One time, the filing said, he showed up at her building and tried to get access to her room, but security refused to let him up.\n\nIn another encounter described in the filing, Weinstein blurted out his sexual attraction to Christina Aguilera, who was being shown on a television, and then allegedly unzipped his pants and touched his penis.\n\nJane Doe first froze, and then fled the office,\u201d the filing said.\n\nWeinstein is also facing criminal charges involving allegations that he raped an unidentified woman in his Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and performed a forcible sex act on a different woman in 2006.\n\nThat case was recently roiled by back-to-back allegations that a New York City police detective acted improperly.\n\nProsecutors dropped a criminal charge involving a third woman after evidence surfaced that Det. Nicholas DiGaudio coached a witness to keep quiet when she raised doubts about the veracity of the allegation.\n\nDays later, prosecutors revealed that DiGaudio allegedly urged the 2013 rape accuser to delete material from her cellphones before she handed them over to prosecutors. The woman didn\u2019t delete any information and instead asked a lawyer for advice, prosecutors said.\n\nBrafman has argued that the 2013 rape allegation is contradicted by warm emails the accuser sent Weinstein after the date of the alleged attack. The lawyer says they show an intimate, consensual relationship.\n\nThe amended civil complaint containing Jane Doe\u2019s allegations was filed on the last day for lawyers to revise the lawsuit. A judge had given them until Oct. 31 after expressing skepticism about the strength of their allegations that the studio board conspired to cover-up Weinstein\u2019s misdeeds by intimidating accusers.\n\nFegan said Wednesday\u2019s 250-page filing makes clear that the studio\u2019s decision-makers knew Weinstein was a sexual predator but \u201cwere making too much money and having too much fun to do anything about it.\u201d", "President Donald Trump passionately reiterated his commitment to ending birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to parents who aren\u2019t citizens during a Florida rally on Wednesday night.\n\nHis comments come days after he told \u201cAxios on HBO\u201d that he could revoke the policy, a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment, via executive order.\n\n\u201cHundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant children are made automatic citizens every year because of this crazy policy, and they are all made instantly eligible for every privilege and benefit of American citizens at a cost of billions of dollars a year,\u201d Trump claimed. \u201cThat\u2019s what it costs \u2015 billions.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s estimate likely comes from a study put out by an anti-immigration think tank, the Center for Immigration Studies, earlier this month.

Many city and religious leaders, however, had asked the Trump family to stay away as the city grieved over the anti-Semitic attack. Hundreds stepped out to protest the visit, linking rhetoric flowing from the administration to a rise in violence against minority groups.\n\nSuch language didn\u2019t appear to stop on Wednesday as the president leveled heated attacks against journalists, his political opponents and immigrants, with rallygoers launching into jeers and chants urging that some Florida Democrats be locked up.\n\nTrump routinely uses such campaign events to whip supporters into an anti-media frenzy, but Wednesday\u2019s appearance reflected a president emboldened and frustrated with a spate of coverage that has distracted from next week\u2019s midterm elections. The New York Times noted earlier this week that Trump has been tossing out increasingly controversial proposals in an attempt to pivot attention back to the elections, including sending thousands of troops to the southern border to deal with a migrant caravan that is weeks away and is proposing an executive order to negate portions of the 14th Amendment that grant citizenship to anyone born in the U.S.\n\nAt the same time, the White House has been dealing with the mass-mailing of likely pipe bombs to prominent Democrats by a loyal Trump supporter and the shooting in Pittsburgh. Critics have linked the attacks to the president\u2019s divisive rhetoric, claims the White House has vehemently denied, instead shifting blame back on the media.\n\nAndrew Harnik/ASSOCIATED PRESS First lady Melania Trump, accompanied by President Donald Trump and Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, visited a makeshift memorial at the Pittsburgh synagogue on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about division, this is a big part of the division right there,\u201d Trump said of coverage of his venture to Pittsburgh. \u201cThe far-left media has spread terrible lies and stories about the Trump administration and the tens of millions of people who make up our great movement.\u201d\n\nThe president continued to celebrate his supporters at the rally, saying his election was \u201cpossibly the greatest political movement anywhere,\u201d and it was all \u201cbecause of you.\u201d", "The Washington Post via Getty Images Education Secretary Betsy DeVos buys into the argument that many sexual assault accusations are false, a lawsuit says, and that's why she rescinded guidelines on campus cases.\n\nA new filing in a lawsuit against the Trump administration accuses Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and a top deputy of being motivated in part by sexism in their policy decisions.\n\nThe lawsuit, originally filed in January, challenged DeVos\u2019 elimination of Obama-era Title IX guidance on how sexual assault cases are handled on campus. But an amended complaint submitted Wednesday says that DeVos\u2019 decision was influenced by discriminatory and stereotyped views of women.\n\nDeVos scrapped the Title IX guidance in September 2017, issuing her own interim guidance on the subject. Her version raised the standard of evidence used in campus sexual assault cases. At the time, DeVos said that the Obama administration\u2019s directive was an example of federal overreach.\n\nBut plaintiffs in the filing say DeVos and her deputies had more nefarious motivations, and they use new Freedom of Information Act records as evidence. The records indicate that Department of Education leaders had solicited input from groups and academics who push inflated and widely discredited statistics regarding the prevalence of false rape allegations. A National Sexual Violence Resource Center study found that false reports account for only about 2 percent to 10 percent of such allegations, a range that it said was likely inflated.\n\n\u201cWhat you see is that this administration is buying into the sex stereotype that women and girls lie about these types of things, and they\u2019re making policy based on that view,\u201d Karianne Jones, counsel for Democracy Forward Foundation, told HuffPost. Democracy Forward is representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, along with the National Women\u2019s Law Center, National Center for Youth Law and Equal Rights Advocates.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the records also show Candice Jackson, then acting head of the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, recommended a book to her staff, Unwanted Advances: Sexual Paranoia Comes to Campus by academic Laura Kipnis. The book describes Obama\u2019s Title IX guidance as allowing women to seek legal recourse for \u201cawkward sexual experiences\u201d and then ask for protection from \u201csexual bogeymen,\u201d per the filing.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Education wasn\u2019t able to comment on the specifics of pending litigation but pushed back on the lawsuit\u2019s assertions, noting that department leaders met with a wide range of stakeholders on the issue at the time.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit is nothing more than a baseless, politically motivated attack on the Secretary,\u201d spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill said by email. \u201cShe and OCR staff met with a number of people on this important issue including survivors, falsely accused students, college presidents and university GCs and the message was very clear from all of them \u2014 we have to get this right on behalf of students and the current process isn\u2019t serving students well.\n\n\u201cThe Secretary is committed to Title IX reforms that will ensure survivors feel empowered to come forward, all students are afforded due process and universities have clear rules to follow.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit says that, although the department solicited the views of those who were critical of Obama\u2019s Title IX guidance, \u201cthe Department met with organizations that advocate for Title IX\u2019s protections for survivors only after repeated, collective requests from those organizations.\u201d\n\nThe FOIA records also show that Jackson had consulted with figures such as professor Gordon Finley of Florida International University on the issue. Finley is a member of the National Coalition for Men, a men\u2019s rights organization, and has referred to Obama\u2019s Title IX guidance as a \u201cwar on men.\u201d\n\nRecords also show Jackson was in close contact with the group Families Advocating for Campus Equality, requesting they publish op-eds before a speech by DeVos, according to the lawsuit. The group was started by parents whose children had been accused of sexual assault on campus.\n\nDeVos previously publicly met with representatives of the National Coalition for Men and Families Advocating for Campus Equality.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case, which include groups like SurvJustice, Equal Rights Advocates and Victim Rights Law Center, say these documents, along with other statements and actions taken by DeVos and Jackson, show they had \u201cdiscriminatory motivation.\u201d\n\nAn original lawsuit filed by the plaintiffs challenged the Trump administration\u2019s overall rescission of Obama\u2019s Title IX guidance. An overall challenge to the rescission was dismissed, with the judge saying you cannot challenge a nonbinding piece of guidance. But the amended complaint takes a different approach, instead focusing on the mindset of administration officials.\n\nAt the time DeVos rescinded the guidance, she said the old process lacked due process. A report from the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday says that DeVos is gearing up to release new rules on the matter, which will require that accused students be allowed to cross-examine their accusers and will narrow the definition of sexual assault cases that schools must arbitrate. Advocates worry that such a process will make victims more reluctant to come forward.\n\nThe lawsuit mentions President Donald Trump\u2019s previous comments and behavior toward women, accusing him of sexism.\n\nJackson previously said that 90 percent of sexual assault accusations are a result of drunken regrets or misunderstandings, a remark noted in the amended complaint and original lawsuit.\n\nAt the time of the original lawsuit, a lawyer for the federal government said this did not prove intentional sexism on Jackson\u2019s part.", "Who could\u2019ve known, prior to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, that there was anything ethically queasy about doing business with \u2015 or acting as a straight-up paid agent of \u2015 the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia? Besides anyone with a functioning moral core and a passing familiarity with the history of the regime, that is \u2015 a category that doesn\u2019t seem to have included the editors of The Washington Post, the newspaper Khashoggi regularly contributed to.\n\nAs the Post reported in its own recent story on the scope of the Saudi \u201cinfluence machine,\u201d two of the paper\u2019s regular opinion writers, Ed Rogers and Carter Eskew, were connected to lobbying firms with contracts with the Saudis. The newspaper \u201ctold them they could not continue to write for The Post and lobby for Saudi Arabia,\u201d and both of their firms dropped their Saudi clients. We have heaped well-deserved scorn on men like Eskew and Rogers for only realizing that it\u2019s bad to take money from a repressive absolute monarchy with a mile-long body count once that count included one of their colleagues. But I think we have let the Post off too easy for only instituting a \u201cdon\u2019t be quietly cashing checks from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia while we publish what are supposed to be your expert opinions\u201d policy after the monsters paying some of their columnists on the side executed a different one.\n\nA certain brand of swampy amorality has long defined the Washington Post opinion section under editor Fred Hiatt. It is a section that, to its credit, has habitually published writers representing a broader ideological spectrum than the voices featured in The New York Times, including actual avowed (democratic) socialists. But, much less to its credit, the other side of that spectrum has tended to include people like Marc Thiessen, one of George W. Bush\u2019s many odious former speechwriters, who was hired at the paper immediately upon publication of his dishonest and morally repulsive book defending his former boss\u2019 torture program.\n\nSo perhaps it is actually not that surprising that the Post published both Khashoggi and a few Blob denizens who were also on the payroll of the people who\u2019d eventually kill him. The normalcy of that arrangement only highlights how profoundly unmoored elite Washington is from any coherent sense of virtue.\n\nBecause Official Washington is awash in unclean money, because so many people are on the take, it did not seem ridiculous or embarrassing for the primary daily newspaper of the nation\u2019s capital to pay people to produce opinion-writing who were also, simultaneously, representing their influence-peddling shops, which had contracts with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nUnder Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Davos Man\u2019s favorite Middle East reformer, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has, if anything, only become more authoritarian and intolerant of dissent. It has imprisoned scores of activists, including more than a dozen women\u2019s rights activists \u2015 while winning positive write-ups in the U.S. for acquiescing to the campaign launched by those activists and allowing women to drive cars. It has been engaged in a brutal and genocidal war against Yemen, starving its people and indiscriminately bombing civilians. It kidnapped the prime minister of Lebanon and seemingly threatened to do another 9/11 to Canada on Twitter. All of this was very easy to find, if one chose to do a quick Google search before signing a contract with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to help its public image in Washington; most of this information is on the prince\u2019s Wikipedia page.\n\nAnd they have been arresting journalists, too \u2015 usually the final straw for American journalists who refuse to pass judgment on abuses of power until one of their own is affected \u2015 with a prominent columnist sentenced to five years in prison for \u201cinsulting the royal court.\u201d You might\u2019ve read about the columnist\u2019s arrest in Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s Jan. 3 column for The Washington Post. Meanwhile, Glover Park Group, the lobbying firm founded by Eskew, was pulling in $150,000 lobbying for Saudi Arabia. And Rogers\u2019 lobbying shop, BGR Group, soon began billing the Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia $80,000 a month, plus expenses, to \u201cprovide public relations and media management services,\u201d along with \u201cgovernment relations work.\u201d (It was not the first such contract: BGR Group had done lobbying work for Saudi Arabia as far back as 2016.)\n\nIn a signed editorial after Khashoggi\u2019s death, Hiatt asked everyone who works for the Saudi Arabian government, \u201cWhy do you work for a murderer?\u201d The Post issued ultimatums to Eskew and Rogers, and both of their firms dropped the kingdom as a client. But it certainly took a long time for Hiatt to ask that question of his own writers.\n\nImagine yourself a newspaper editor, in charge of the opinion section for the capital city of the world\u2019s leading hegemon. What audience does it serve to give a platform to a paid agent of a repressive theocratic monarchy \u2015 paying him to write replacement-level columns like \u201cTrump\u2019s distractions overwhelm Republicans\u2019 economic success\u201d and \u201cDemocrats and the liberal media are afraid of Kanye West\u201d? These are the keen insights of a longtime political veteran, and also a person who advertises \u2015 right there in his author bio! \u2015 that his purported ability to influence people is literally for sale. Who is this for?

Jerry Brown signed legislation that increased the state\u2019s gasoline taxes for the first time in decades. His signature added 12 cents to the 28-cents-per-gallon excise tax on gasoline and 20 cents to the diesel tax over the course of 10 years. That\u2019s on top of the 18 cents per gallon paid in federal taxes.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Prop. 6 supporters say the money for road repairs shouldn't be paid for by additional taxes.\n\nThe money is being used to fund a $52 billion repair plan to improve the state\u2019s infrastructure. Most of it it will go to road rehabilitation projects with the goal of bringing at least 98 percent of state highway pavement into good or fair condition. Currently, the state is grappling with a $130 billion backlog of road and bridge repairs.\n\nAbout a quarter of the money is slated for other projects, including improvements to public transportation systems and reducing traffic in the most congested areas.\n\nPrior to the new tax, California ranked seventh in the nation in gas tax costs. An analysis by Politifact found that, unless Prop. 6 passes, it ranks second highest, just behind Pennsylvania and ahead of Washington and Hawaii.\n\nBrown\u2019s administration says the average motorist in California should expect gas cost increases of about $10 a month, or about $120 a year. However, an in-depth analysis by The Sacramento Bee found it could be closer to a range of $153 to $215.\n\nDespite paying the tax, Californians can expect to save money.\n\nImproving California\u2019s bad roads \u2015 by fixing potholes that damage cars and correcting poor highway design that causes congestion, for example \u2015 is expected to save drivers more money on gas and repair costs than they\u2019re paying in gas taxes.\n\nResearch published in recent months by TRIP, a nonpartisan, nonprofit transportation research group based in Washington, D.C., does a nice job of breaking down how those costs add up in California.\n\n\u201cDue to inadequate state and local funding,\u201d the group wrote in an August report, \u201c68 percent of major roads and highways in California are in poor or mediocre condition costing the average state driver an extra $843 annually in additional vehicle operating costs as a result of driving on rough roads.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s about $22.1 billion statewide.\n\nBut nationally, the group reported in October, with about half the roads in as poor a condition as California\u2019s, the average motorist is losing $599 annually \u2015 a total of $130 billion nationally \u2015 as a result of driving on bad roads. That\u2019s $244 less than the average Californian is paying.\n\nJustin Sullivan via Getty Images California has about twice as many damaged roadways as the national average.\n\nSo, even if California is only able to get road conditions on par with the national average, the average driver paying the expected $120 in additional state gas taxes will likely have a net savings of roughly that same amount.\n\n\u201cYou put [those savings] into perspective and suddenly the numbers start to make sense,\u201d California politics analyst Larry Gerston, professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University, told HuffPost.\n\nSo why are Republicans pushing to overturn it?\n\nRepublicans are against raising taxes and argue that the money for the road projects could be paid with other money in the state\u2019s coffers if it reworked its budget.\n\nBut what may be more likely is that Republicans are convinced this issue will drive GOP voters to the polls and help keep GOP lawmakers in office.\n\nGerston pointed to sizable contributions to the tax repeal campaign from House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield and Rep. Devin Nunes, a Trump ally from the state\u2019s Central Valley.\n\n\u201cClearly, Paul Ryan, McCarthy, Nunes have all poured various amounts of money into supporting Prop. 6, so they believe that, in general, it\u2019s a way of getting out the Republican vote,\u201d Gersten said, though he\u2019s skeptical that their effort will pay off. Those lawmakers might be, too: In the final run-up to the Nov. 6 elections, Gersten noted, Republicans have stopped pumping money into the Proposition 6 campaign.\n\nThe gas tax has also been one of the prominent themes on campaign signage this election cycle, reporters covering the races have noted.\n\nSanctuary state and gas tax themes prominent on several campaign signs this weekend. Many state party activists hanging on the hope these two issues will mobilize GOP voters in November, even though sanctuary state policy not likely to be on ballot. pic.twitter.com/kAqXKGTUKe \u2014 Christine Mai-Duc (@cmaiduc) May 5, 2018\n\nThere\u2019s some hope this could be an effective strategy because ...\n\nA good chunk of Californians oppose the gas tax.\n\nIt remains to be seen how much this issue will drive voters to the polls, but the Public Policy Institute of California found in September that 52 percent of likely voters oppose Proposition 6, despite evidence it could cost them money. That\u2019s an especially slim majority for such a blue state.\n\nOn the flip side, the survey found that 39 percent of voters \u2015 including 50 percent of Republicans and 33 percent of Democrats \u2015 plan to vote in favor of the repeal, while 8 percent remain undecided.\n\nThat\u2019s put some Democratic candidates in competitive congressional races in a tight spot.\n\nA number of Democratic candidates in key congressional races have broken from the Democrat majority on the issue and come out in favor of Proposition 6, likely in their own effort to appeal to voters.\n\nThey include Katie Porter of Irvine, Josh Harder of Turlock, Jessica Morse of Pollock Pines, Ammar Campa-Najjar of east San Diego County and Andrew Janz in the San Joaquin Valley.\n\nThe issue has emerged most strongly in Porter\u2019s Orange County district race against GOP Rep. Mimi Walters, who accused her opponent of flip-flopping on the issue in an attack ad. A PAC affiliated with Paul Ryan paid a reported $550,000 to $750,000 for Walters to run the ad.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Katie Porter, who's running against incumbent Republican Mimi Walters in Orange County, is one of a handful of Democrats who've come out against the gas tax.\n\nOther Democrats have brushed off the issue. Katie Hill, a Democrat facing Rep. Steve Knight in northern Los Angeles County, was disparaged in a similar attack ad from the same PAC. But when asked about the tax during a September debate, she sidestepped.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what ideas they\u2019re referring to, but I think the fact that I\u2019m being attacked on gas, on a state legislative issue, shows you there\u2019s not a whole lot to be attacking,\u201d she said.\n\nHill did not return HuffPost\u2019s request for clarity on her stance.\n\nBut how likely is it that this issue would sway people\u2019s votes?\n\nGerston isn\u2019t sure the Republican spending on Prop. 6 will have a great return on investment.\n\n\u201cClearly, Republicans spent a lot of money on Proposition 6, relatively speaking, but it\u2019s uncertain to me if they\u2019ll get much more of a payoff than they would have gotten otherwise,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCalifornia has become such an incredibly blue state that we\u2019re now looking at Republicans only in terms of pockets,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo, yes, in certain pockets of eastern Los Angeles County and Orange County and maybe northeast San Diego County, you may see a larger Republican turnout than we might have expected in the rest of the state, but in those cases, most of it will have to do with retaining Republican members of Congress or keeping seats from going to the Democrats.\u201d"]
