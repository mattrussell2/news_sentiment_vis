["A New Jersey man accused of DWI tried to put the blame on the real culprit: the New York Jets.\n\nChristopher Greyshock, 57, of West Milford, was charged Sunday afternoon after he rear-ended another vehicle, injuring at least one woman in the process, according to NBC New York.\n\nOfficers from the Wayne Police Department said Greyshock was \u201cstaggering and swaying, unable to walk straight in danger of falling onto the highway.\u201d\n\nThey also noticed a \u201cheavy odor\u201d of alcohol on his breath and \u201cstains of liquid\u201d on his clothes.\n\nGreyshock allegedly admitted he rear-ended the car that was stopped in traffic in front of him.\n\nThat\u2019s when authorities performed a field sobriety test on Greyshock.\n\nHe allegedly failed the test by registering a blood alcohol level of 0.13 percent, well above New Jersey\u2019s legal limit of .08 percent, according to NorthJersey.com.\n\nDuring the test, Greyshock allegedly told police, \u201cI drank too much because the Jets suck!\u201d according to The Associated Press.\n\nAbout an hour before the accident, the Jets had their own tragedy, losing 41-10 to the Buffalo Bills.\n\nGreyshock apparently went to great lengths to drown his sorrows: He allegedly had an open bottle of whiskey and suspected marijuana in his car.", "ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) announced that he will not vote to confirm any more of President Donald Trump\u2019s judicial nominees until a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller receives a vote in the Senate.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he will not vote to confirm any more of President Donald Trump\u2019s judicial nominees until a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation into possible collusion with Russian officials receives a vote in the Senate.\n\nFlake, who is one of the president\u2019s biggest Republican critics in the Senate and is retiring at the end of this year, made the announcement shortly after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) objected to Flake\u2019s unanimous consent request to bring the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act to a vote on the floor.\n\nThe bill, authored by Sens. Chris Coons (D-Del.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), passed in the Senate Judiciary Committee this year in a bipartisan vote of 14-7. The measure would make it harder for Trump to fire Mueller by requiring officials to have \u201cgood cause\u201d to fire the special counsel. GOP leaders, however, have consistently maintained such protections are unnecessary because they do not believe Trump will fire Mueller.\n\n\u201cThere has been no indication ... that the Mueller investigation will not be allowed to finish,\u201d McConnell told reporters earlier on Wednesday.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s efforts to shield the special counsel come amid Trump\u2019s intensifying attacks on Mueller, who is leading an investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election. Trump has reportedly spoken several times about firing Mueller, whose probe Trump derisively refers to as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nThe push to protect Mueller took on more urgency after last week\u2019s ouster of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his replacement by acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, who is viewed as a White House loyalist and has attacked the Mueller probe. Legal experts and several top Democrats have questioned whether Whitaker\u2019s appointment was constitutional, given that he was never confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\u201cWith the firing of the attorney general and, in my view, the improper installation of an acting attorney general who has not been subject to confirmation by this body, the president now has this investigation in his sights, and we all know it,\u201d Flake said in a speech on Wednesday, adding that he informed McConnell of his decision to oppose the president\u2019s judicial nominees on Tuesday.\n\nWhile Flake will be able to slow down the pace of Trump\u2019s judicial nominations, he won\u2019t be able to block all of them by himself. Unlike in the Judiciary Committee, where Republicans hold a slim 11-10 majority, Flake\u2019s vote is less crucial in the full Senate, where Republicans have enough votes to confirm judges without him. However, if any other GOP senator joins Flake in opposing judicial nominations, the Senate would not see a vote on a judicial nominee before Jan. 3, when the next congressional session begins.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) last week renewed her call for the Senate to pass legislation that would protect the special counsel, but it\u2019s unclear whether she or any other GOP sponsor of the bill will join Flake in blocking nominees.\n\nTwenty-one nominations are pending before the Judiciary Committee, according to Flake. Thirty-two other judicial nominations have already been reported out of the committee and are ready for a vote on the Senate floor.\n\nTrump claimed credit for pushing Flake out of the Senate in a press conference last week.\n\n\u201cI retired him.

Kennedy in November 1962 to a low of 35 percent for Trump in December 2017. In the days leading up to the 2018 midterm elections, Trump\u2019s approval rating rose slightly to 40 percent. Still, a commanding 54 percent of those polled said they disapproved of Trump\u2019s performance. His low approval ratings contributed to the resurgence of the Democratic Party in the House, where they picked up at least 33 seats and regained control of the chamber.\n\nRecord turnout and pointed campaigning in battleground states also helped Democrats pick up Senate seats in Arizona and Nevada, which would have been enough to take control of that chamber if all the party\u2019s incumbents there had held on to their seats.\n\nInstead, the chambers swung in opposite directions, with Republicans building on their majority in the Senate. They have already secured a 51-seat majority in the upper chamber and look likely to add two seats \u2015 Florida and Mississippi \u2015 by the time the dust settles.\n\nIf the GOP\u2019s success in the senatorial elections is a sign of anything, it is this: Regardless of what the country thinks of Trump or whom the majority of the country votes for, the current president maintains a very good chance of winning a second election in 2020.\n\nTrump\u2019s Advantage\n\nThe key to Trump\u2019s success is rooted in the unequal distribution of racial and ethnic groups across the Electoral College system. This arrangement allows him to target favorable demographic windows that lean hard to the right and exploit them to his party\u2019s advantage. This is how he won in 2016. And this is how his party beat incumbent Democratic senators in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota in the midterm elections this year. And if he wins again in 2020, this demographic advantage will lie at the center of his success.\n\nAs I argued here last month, migration of minorities out of rural states has demographically structured the United States such that the Electoral College favors not only rural states, as it was designed to do, but also conservative white voters who reside in greater numbers in rural regions of the country. As a result, instead of balancing power across rural and urban states, the Electoral College creates opportunities for ultraconservative factions to enter the national stage.\n\nPeople who support the Electoral College typically argue that the system was designed to provide rural regions of the country with equal representation. While this is at least partly true, it is important to keep in mind that when the Electoral College was devised, the only people who could vote were white males. And although white women gained the right to vote in 1920, minorities in the U.S. didn\u2019t gain full citizenship until the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965. By that time, demographically, the U.S. was a very different place from in 1787, when the founders drafted the Constitution.\n\nJeff Swensen via Getty Images Since Aug. 1, 2018, Trump has held 33 campaign-style rallies, targeting states with rural, white populations and higher than average approval ratings for the president.\n\nEarly statesmen never could have envisioned the degree to which the Industrial Revolution would affect the distribution of residents across rural and urban settings. According to the Census Bureau, in 1800, 94 percent of the country lived in a rural setting. By 1900, that number dropped to 60 percent. Today, over 80 percent of U.S. residents live in an urban setting.\n\nWhile people from all racial and ethnic backgrounds left the countryside in search of opportunities from 1800 to 2018, as a percentage of their population, minorities left at much higher rates than whites. The unequal migration of people out of rural America helps us make sense of Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 as well as Republicans\u2019 ability to retain the Senate in 2018, despite their significant loss in the national popular vote for the House.\n\nAs Graph 1 illustrates, in states where at least 50 percent of the population lives in a rural setting, 81 percent of residents are white, which is 19 percentage points higher than the national average (62 percent) reported in the 2016 American Community Survey. The number of white residents drops to 57 percent in urban states. This trend is inverse to the ratio between electoral votes and population. That is, rural states average one electoral vote for every 393,393 people. In contrast, predominantly urban states average one electoral vote for every 590,081 residents. In practical terms, individuals living in whiter, rural states have 50 percent more representation in presidential elections than people living in urban states.\n\nGraph 1: Average population per electoral vote in rural, semirural and urban states\n\nBenjamin Waddell The bars show the percentage of white voters in rural, semirural and urban states. The line represents the average number of voters represented by each electoral vote. *The white population depicts individuals who identified as non-Hispanic white in the 2016 American Community Survey; data via FactFinder.Census.gov.\n\nAs Graph 2 shows, representation in the Senate is even more skewed. In urban states, there is one senator for every 5,225,465 residents, compared with one senator for every 1,184,428 residents in rural states. As a consequence, people living in rural (whiter) states have 341 percent more representation in the Senate than people living in urban states.\n\nGraph 2: Average population per senator in rural, semirural and urban states\n\nBenjamin Waddell\n\nThis arrangement wouldn\u2019t be so pernicious if racial and ethnic minorities voted consistently across party lines, but that\u2019s not the case. All minority groups \u2014 without exception \u2014 vote predominantly for Democratic candidates in major elections. In fact, in the 2018 midterm elections, ethnic and racial minorities favored Democrats by an average margin of nearly 60 percentage points. Put simply, no factor in American politics predicts voter outcomes across party lines better than race. And this is particularly true in rural America, where white voters show a strong preference for Trump and his party.\n\nThus, while the Electoral College may have been designed to equalize representation across rural and urban states, as it currently exists, the system systematically favors white voters living in sparsely populated areas of the country.\n\nAnd nobody seems to understand this better than Trump, who, since Aug. 1, 2018, has held 33 campaign-style rallies across the United States. He has used his rallies to target states with rural, white populations and higher than average approval ratings for the president. While 62 percent of the nation identifies as white, the states he has targeted in recent rallies average 72 percent white. And while his approval ratings hover around 40 percent nationally, in rally states, his ratings average 50 percent.\n\nThe Obama Effect\n\nObama is often cited as evidence of a colorblind electoral system. And while he was the first black president of the United States, it is important to keep in mind that he is a quintessential outlier. He won the presidency twice, and in each election he pulled enough votes in key electoral states to gather more than the needed 270 electoral votes.\n\nStill, he was a once-in-a-generation candidate. He is a gifted speaker, compassionate father and expert statesman and is extremely talented at navigating highly contentious political matters with grace. While Obama\u2019s presidency clearly represents a breakthrough moment in the long road to racial equality, it\u2019s simply misleading to imply that his election is evidence of a colorblind society.\n\nTo be fair, Obama\u2019s success demonstrates that race isn\u2019t an absolute barrier to the Oval Office. However, as Trump clearly shows, in the right election cycle, it can be. The 2016 election is a great case in point.\n\nObama\u2019s victories in 2008 and 2012 distract from the fact that American presidential elections are predominately decided by swing voters in a handful of states where, in most election years, a large majority of residents are white. In 2016, for example, three states decided the election: Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, 76 percent of the population in Michigan is white, 82 percent in Wisconsin and 78 percent in Pennsylvania. These numbers grow when we look at voting-age populations. Whites account for 79 percent of the voting-age population in Michigan, 86 percent in Wisconsin and 81 percent in Pennsylvania.\n\nScott Olson via Getty Images Sen.Claire McCaskill of Missouri was one of at least three Democratic incumbents who lost in states that are whiter than the national population.\n\nObama won each of these states in 2008 and 2012, but his success was largely the result of record turnout among young voters and his ability to pull moderates to his side of the aisle. But more important, he had favorable Electoral College windows. That is, the combination of states that ultimately decided the election did not work against him.\n\nCombined, the demographic makeup of each of these groupings was more in line with the country\u2019s national population. However, in 2016 that changed when Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania emerged as the most important states in the election. This combination placed the fate of the presidential election in the hands of three states with higher than average populations of white voters, and in doing so, it created the perfect demographic window for Trump.\n\nA recent study on white swing voters in the 2016 election found that \u201cwhite voters with racially conservative or anti-immigrant attitudes switched votes to Trump at a higher rate than those with more liberal views on these issues.\u201d Other authors have come to similar conclusions, finding that racial resentment played a clear role in Trump\u2019s success in 2016.\n\nAnd all available evidence points to a similar advantage in the 2018 midterms.\n\nThe Midterm Elections\n\nTrump\u2019s party flipped three states in the Senate: Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota. Not surprisingly, as Graph 3 shows, the president\u2019s approval ratings as of October 2018 were higher than average in these states. In Missouri, where 78 percent of residents are white, 52 percent of voters approved of Trump\u2019s performance. In Indiana, which is 80 percent white, 52 percent of voters approved of the president, and in North Dakota, which is 86 percent white, Trump registered an approval rating of 55 percent.\n\nGraph 3: White population and Trump approval ratings across Senate seats flipped by Republicans\n\nBenjamin Waddell The bars show the white population percentage in Missouri, Indiana and North Dakota. The line shows Trump's approval rating in each state, all above the national average.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, it seemed likely that Trump\u2019s demographic window might close if minorities and young people went to the polls in higher numbers. In the midterms, both groups voted in record numbers, contributing to Democratic flipping of Republican-held seats in Arizona and Nevada. Nonetheless, Republicans were able to retain control of the Senate by flipping seats in whiter states.\n\nThat\u2019s the power of the Electoral College.\n\nWe live in a nation that is deeply affected by racial inequalities, and we elect presidents and senators in a system that favors a handful of states where white, conservative voters make up the clear majority of eligible voters. This explains how openly racist candidates with \u201calt-right\u201d tendencies like Trump have been elected in recent years. And barring no major changes to the electoral landscape, it explains why more leaders of this nature may be elected in the future.\n\nFuture Elections\n\nAlthough diversity is on the rise across the U.S., including in rural areas, minority populations tend to be much younger than the majority group. In 2015 the median age for minorities in the U.S. was 31, whereas for whites, it was 43. In the 2016 election, the median age of voters was 47.5. And Trump cleaned house with voters in the 45 and older group, where he held an 8 percentage point advantage over Hillary Clinton. She maintained a 14 point advantage with 18-to-44-year-olds.\n\nSo what made the difference in 2016? Young people and young people of color in particular didn\u2019t turn out to vote at the same rates as white voters. Graph 4 illustrates voter turnout from 1980 to 2016 by age group.\n\nGraph 4: Voter turnout by age group, 1980 to 2016\n\nBenjamin Waddell\n\nGraph 5 shows voter turnout across racial and ethnic groups. Non-Hispanic whites go to the polls at much higher rates than other racial and ethnic groups. Black, non-Hispanic voters also turn out at high rates, but their rate fell sharply, from 66.6 to 59.6 percent in 2016, whereas white rates rose, from 64.1 to 65.3 percent. Hispanic and other ethnic groups have consistently voted at substantially lower rates.\n\nGraph 5: Voter turnout by racial and ethnic group, 1980 to 2016\n\nBenjamin Waddell\n\nIn the long run, as larger minority populations in rural states reach voting age, representation through the Electoral College may begin to reflect the nation\u2019s actual demographics again. However, in the short run, we are trapped in an electoral system that devalues minority voices.", "Christopher Polk/E!

The members also intend to note another contingent of Democrats who privately say they won\u2019t support the longtime California Democrat but won\u2019t sign the letter, according to Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), one of the ringleaders of the effort to block Pelosi.\n\nSources familiar with the letter say there are currently 17 names on it, but the group is trying to get more than 20 members before releasing it. Currently on the letter, though not certain to stay on it, are:\n\n- Tim Ryan (D-Ohio)\n\n- Seth Moulton (D-Mass.)\n\n- Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.)\n\n- Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.)\n\n- Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.)\n\n- Filemon Vela Jr. (D-Texas)\n\n- Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio)\n\n- Bill Foster (D-Ill.)\n\n- Brian Higgins (D-N.Y.)\n\n- Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.)\n\n- Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.)\n\n- Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.)\n\n- Jeff Van Drew (D-N.J.)\n\n- Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.)\n\n- Max Rose (D-N.Y.)\n\n- Anthony Brindisi (D-N.Y.)\n\n- Ben McAdams (D-Utah)\n\nThere is another contingent of Democrats \u2015 including Conor Lamb (D-Pa.), Dan Lipinksi (D-Ill.), Ron Kind (D-Wis.), Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), Jason Crow (D-Colo.), Haley Stevens (D-Mich.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) and Andy Kim (D-N.J.) \u2015 who are seen as likely to vote against Pelosi, but who also are hesitant to sign the letter.\n\nFor Pelosi allies, keeping the number of names on the letter limited is a key to her survival, as more members publicly pledging to not support her would be a nail in the coffin.\n\nBut Pelosi also has a number of ways she could wrangle the speaker\u2019s gavel even if a dozen and a half members pledge to oppose her. For one, Democrats could make a new rule binding every member to vote for the Democratic nominee. Rule changes associated with that idea are already under consideration, and there\u2019s some thought that Pelosi may try to formalize rules so that Democrats have to vote for her, though many members question how this strategy would work. (Would they kick out the members who don\u2019t vote for the Democratic nominee? Would they still have a majority?)\n\nThere\u2019s also the thought that some Republicans could vote \u201cpresent,\u201c\n\nthus lowering the threshold for Pelosi. But that presents its own challenges. In effect, Republicans would have veto power over the speaker and Pelosi would not be negotiating from any position of strength.\n\nThe way the speaker election works is that a candidate first gets the nomination behind closed doors during the Democratic Caucus meeting. That is the easiest hurdle to clear. A candidate only needs a majority of their party for the speaker nomination, and Pelosi has that part essentially locked up.\n\nThe hard part is the floor vote, when a candidate needs a majority of the House: 218 of the 435 members. That number includes Republicans. While we don\u2019t know the exact breakdown of the House yet, it\u2019s likely to be around 234 Democrats and 201 Republicans \u2015 give or take a couple of members on both sides. If the number is 234 Democrats, Pelosi can lose only 16 Democrats if every member votes.\n\nThe trick for Pelosi would be to get some of her Democratic opponents \u2015 or Republicans \u2015 to vote present. That would lower the threshold for her election. In effect, a present vote would be a half-vote for Pelosi.\n\nBut the Democrats who say they are opposed to Pelosi are already swearing they won\u2019t vote present. If Pelosi can\u2019t convince some of those Democrats who oppose her to vote present, she has a real problem.\n\nThe anti-Pelosi members are working to gather as many names as possible as quick as possible, as they believe the longer they remain in the shadows, the more likely it is that Pelosi could flip some of their members.\n\nBut Pelosi\u2019s opponents also told HuffPost they think the actual number of Democrats who do not want to vote for Pelosi is much larger than anyone anticipates, and they remain confident she doesn\u2019t have the votes.\n\nRyan, who ran against Pelosi to be minority leader at the end of the last Congress, told reporters Wednesday that he was certain Pelosi didn\u2019t have the votes, and multiple members who support Pelosi even told HuffPost on the condition of anonymity that they believe she is in trouble.\n\nOne of the members pointed to Pelosi\u2019s minority leader race in 2016 with Ryan in which he received 63 votes from his Democratic colleagues to Pelosi\u2019s 134. This member said Pelosi didn\u2019t get the message when one-third of the caucus voted for a \u201cbackbencher.\u201d\n\nBut if Pelosi didn\u2019t get the message before, she and her team are certainly working now to try to tamp down the revolt and swing the incoming Democrats from no to yes \u2015 or at least to \u201cpresent.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s allies all readily point out that \u201cyou can\u2019t beat somebody with nobody,\u201d but Pelosi\u2019s opponents are testing that idea. In fact, they seem to think their movement is strengthened without a clear alternative.\n\nThe idea is that, once Pelosi knows she can\u2019t win, she will step aside and there would be a new race for the speaker position.\n\nTo that point, one office for a prominent Democrat already reached out to HuffPost to suggest that their boss is well-positioned to become speaker if Pelosi can\u2019t get the votes.\n\nMembers believe \u2015 for good reason \u2015 that there would be a rush of candidates for the speaker job if Pelosi stepped down, potentially including Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), Assistant Minority Leader Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) and Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.).\n\nRyan, in an effort to deflect criticism that the anti-Pelosi Democrats are just trying to knock off a woman from a leadership role, repeatedly said Wednesday that he\u2019d like to see another woman become speaker, and he has pointed to four women: Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.), Karen Bass (D-Calif.), and Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.). (Fudge and Rice are both also anti-Pelosi.)\n\nMoulton has also been strongly pushing Fudge, who is a former Congressional Black Caucus chairwoman.\n\nThe anti-Pelosi group is expected to release its letter by the end of the week, though Ryan also said they would hold the letter as long as they were still getting new signatures. Ryan, Moulton, and Perlmutter are the members loosely organizing the letter, and they\u2019re checking in mostly with the new Democrats to make sure they won\u2019t flip under pressure.\n\nBut Ryan also assured reporters Wednesday that there were more Democrats than just those who will be on the letter who intend to vote against Pelosi \u2015 they just don\u2019t want the scrutiny associated with revealing themselves.\n\nStill, Pelosi says she is confident she can survive.\n\nExiting a caucus meeting this morning, Pelosi said she could stop and take questions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a busy person,\u201d she said. \u201cI will be speaker of the House no matter what Seth Moulton says.\u201d", "WASHINGTON \u2015 He claimed during the campaign that his opponent illegally funded a caravan of migrants approaching the U.S. border, but now that he\u2019s won re-election, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) doesn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to talk about policy, but there\u2019s no point in revisiting the campaign itself,\u201d Cruz said during a brief interview in a Senate elevator.\n\nThe week before the election, Cruz said campaign staffers for his Democratic challenger, Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, had given campaign funds to illegal immigrants. He said in a tweet that every reporter should ask O\u2019Rourke if he used campaign dollars to \u201cillegally fund\u201d the migrant caravan, a supposed national security threat President Donald Trump had been hyping.\n\nOn Wednesday, the question had lost its urgency.\n\n\u201cAs I said, the election is over,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nAn undercover video by a conservative propagandist James O\u2019Keefe had inspired Cruz\u2019s caravan claims. The video showed O\u2019Rourke staffers talking about buying food and blankets for migrants who had apparently been taken in by a Texas church after having been dropped off by federal immigration authorities at an El Paso bus station.\n\nO\u2019Keefe claimed the video showed staffers talking about illegally misusing funds to assist illegal immigrants, but it\u2019s legal to donate campaign funds to charity and it\u2019s legal to enter the U.S. to seek asylum. The people at the church had apparently followed the legal process and were awaiting a resolution of their claims.\n\nThe O\u2019Rourke campaign said it would properly inform the Federal Election Commission of the goods its staffers had donated.\n\nThe so-called migrant caravan is a separate group of immigrants who at the time were hundreds of miles away in Mexico. As of Wednesday afternoon, some had reached the U.S. border.\n\nTrump had said without evidence that the group contains terrorists and \u201cunknown Middle Easterners,\u201d but since last week\u2019s elections, he\u2019s basically stopped talking about it.\n\nCruz didn\u2019t want to talk about his O\u2019Rourke allegation, but he was willing to say the migrants should be stopped.", "Laverne Cox marked Transgender Awareness Week by giving a young trans man the surprise of his life.\n\nIn a Tuesday appearance on \u201cFearless,\u201d Cox speaks with Rickey, a 25-year-old transgender man from Kansas City, Missouri.

Without privilege, the House leadership can ignore the bill. In other words, it\u2019s now almost certain that the House won\u2019t deal with the legislation \u2015 and, more broadly, the conflict itself \u2015 until Democrats take charge next year.\n\nWednesday\u2019s vote is the best possible outcome for the Saudis and their friends in the Trump administration \u2015 who were worried about congressional anger over the war in Yemen and the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi \u2015 and a boon for Republicans \u2015 who were scared of a vote that would force them to either break with President Donald Trump or endorse a military campaign that has been accused of thousands of war crimes.\n\nBut even before the vote, opponents of the war had issued loud reminders that they would not be giving up.\n\n\u201cJanuary can\u2019t come soon enough,\u201d tweeted Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), a leading anti-war figure who\u2019s expected to ascend to House Democratic leadership. The likely future speaker, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), blasted Ryan\u2019s move and Republicans\u2019 attempts to justify it by pointing to Trump\u2019s decision last week to end one aspect of U.S. assistance to the Saudis. \u201cThis step alone does not come close to addressing our concerns, or stopping the carnage,\u201d she said.\n\nA similar bill with privileged status is still alive in the Senate, where Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) is expected to bring it to the floor for a vote later this month. \u201cThere\u2019s a clear path to victory, thanks to a bipartisan consensus to end the U.S. role in this misbegotten war,\u201d said Kate Kizer of the advocacy group Win Without War, referring to Republicans critical of the war like Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Todd Young (R-Ind.).\n\nAhead of Wednesday\u2019s vote, Democrats tried to shame Republicans, accusing them of abdicating Congress\u2019 role in approving American military operations and thereby encouraging brutality and abandoning their own promises to respect the Constitution.\n\n\u201cI plead with my Republican colleagues: Please vote no. ... Let\u2019s have a debate about the starvation and the killing going on there and do the right thing for our Constitution and the world,\u201d said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), the lead author of the House bill. He noted that the House had in the past allowed similar resolutions based on the War Powers Act to be considered on the floor even if they were ultimately defeated.\n\nRyan began the effort to strip privilege from the bill Tuesday in the House Rules Committee, stunning Democratic leaders and outside groups lobbying Congress on Yemen who had thought that the legislation would at least be considered. Even some conservatives joined the chorus of criticism: \u201cThis is despicable, gutless and wrong,\u201d Christopher Preble of the libertarian Cato Institute wrote on Twitter.\n\nSeveral Republicans in both chambers who are wary of American adventurism abroad and the legality of military action initiated without congressional approval have publicly supported the measures from Khanna and Sanders.\n\nTwo of them, Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Walter Jones (R-N.C.), lobbied fellow GOP lawmakers to vote against Ryan\u2019s effort in a Wednesday morning letter obtained by HuffPost. \u201cThis rule ... serves only to obstruct our constitutional right to decide questions regarding the use of military force,\u201d they wrote in a message also signed by Reps. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) and Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). The hope was that they could persuade at least 19 Republicans to buck the party line and they targeted those who had in 2016 voted against the transfer of cluster bombs to the Saudis for use in Yemen.\n\nTheir ultimate failure closes off one of the routes to quickly ending U.S. support for the Saudi-led campaign. Facing global pressure \u2015 particularly from American allies like the U.K. \u2015 Saudi Arabia and its partner the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday temporarily halted an offensive against Yemen\u2019s most important port. International negotiators are pushing ahead with plans with peace talks.", "WASHINGTON \u2015 Andy Kim, a national security adviser to President Barack Obama who returned home to suburban New Jersey to challenge the biggest Donald Trump supporter in the Garden State\u2019s congressional delegation, has won a tight race against GOP Rep. Tom MacArthur and made history in the process.\n\nThe Associated Press called the race on Wednesday afternoon, more than a week after the polls closed. Kim will become the first Korean-American Democrat to serve in Congress, which hasn\u2019t had a lawmaker of Korean descent since 1999. (Republican Young Kim is locked in a too-close-to-call race in California; if she prevails, she would be the first Korean-American woman in Congress.)\n\nAndy Kim\u2019s win adds to the House majority Democrats won in last Tuesday\u2019s election by gaining more than 30 seats and is the latest of a number of late-deciding races that went the party\u2019s way.\n\nThe son of South Korean immigrants who was raised in the Philadelphia exurb of Marlton, Kim campaigned as a moderate and didn\u2019t talk a lot about Trump in New Jersey\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, a sprawling district that spans the state from the banks of the Delaware River to the Atlantic shoreline. Trump carried the district by six percentage points in 2016.\n\nIn the largely white district, Kim faced campaign ads that painted him as a carpetbagger despite his home state roots. One mailer, sent by the state\u2019s Republican Party, featured photos of fish heads on ice and Kim\u2019s name printed in Chop Suey font.\n\nAs vote-counting continued after no winner emerged on election night, Kim declared victory last week when he gained a lead on MacArthur. Kim gathered most of his support in Burlington County \u2015 the blueish suburbs of Philadelphia \u2015 while MacArthur\u2019s base was in Ocean County, the red part of the district that it home to a number of retirement communities.\n\nMacArthur, a millionaire former insurance executive, moved into the district from northern New Jersey to successfully run in 2014 for the seat that another Republican, former Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Jon Runyan, was giving up.\n\nAlong with emerging as a vocal Trump supporter, MacArthur played a key role in reviving House Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare, an effort that was narrowly defeated in the Senate in 2017. He was also the only New Jersey Republican to vote for Trump\u2019s tax-cut bill, which because of the state\u2019s notoriously high property taxes hit homeowners hard.", "President Donald Trump lied in an interview Wednesday about the prevalence of voter fraud, telling The Daily Caller that Republicans were losing elections \u201cbecause of potentially illegal votes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It\u2019s really a disgrace what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nTrump offered no evidence for his claims, and several studies and investigations have shown voter fraud is not a widespread problem. (He also suggested people need to have voter ID to buy cereal at the store, which isn\u2019t true.)\n\nThe president has lied about voter fraud before. He once said that between 3 and 5 million people voted illegally in the 2016 election, but there\u2019s no evidence that\u2019s true. He convened a commission to investigate voter fraud but disbanded it after the panel only met twice.\n\nAny kind of voter fraud is rare, but the specific kind of fraud Trump seemed to be citing in his recent interview \u2015 voter impersonation at the polls \u2015 is particularly unusual. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and a former top Justice Department official, found there were just 31 credible allegations of voter impersonation between 2000 and 2014. There were over a billion votes cast during that same period. The Justice Department also studied voter fraud from 2002 to 2007 and didn\u2019t find much.\n\nWhen someone casts an illegal vote, it is usually because of confusion or error. Noncitizens may accidentally check a box indicating they\u2019re citizens and vote when no election official stops them. People with felony convictions may also be confused about whether they can vote.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments come amid a slew of attacks on election officials in Florida who are counting votes to determine the outcome of races in the state\u2019s U.S. Senate, gubernatorial and agriculture commissioner race. Election experts say there\u2019s nothing unusual about what Florida officials are doing.\n\nShortly after the 2016 election, Trump alleged he only lost the state of New Hampshire because people were bused in to vote illegally. New Hampshire officials investigated the claim and found it wasn\u2019t true.\n\nNorth Carolina officials also looked for voter fraud after the 2016 election. State officials found 24 cases of double voting and two cases of voter impersonation that were referred to prosecutors. Around 4.8 million people voted in North Carolina in 2016.\n\nThe scant evidence of fraud hasn\u2019t stopped lawmakers in either state from passing new voting restrictions. In New Hampshire, Republicans passed a law requiring new voters to take additional steps to prove they were \u201cdomiciled\u201d at their address (a judge struck it down earlier this year). In North Carolina, Republicans put a constitutional amendment on the ballot this year to require photo voter ID at the polls. The measure passed last week.\n\nThe White House has previously pointed to Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) as someone who can provide evidence of widespread voter fraud. Kobach supported Trump\u2019s claim that millions may have voted illegally in 2016 and claimed up to 18,000 noncitizens had attempted to register to vote in Kansas. But Kobach failed to successfully defend that claim in federal court earlier this year. A federal judge found that only 39 noncitizens had gotten on the rolls in the state since 1999.", "Donald Trump has stated some very strange falsehoods in the past, but the one he made on Wednesday about voter ID cards is a doozy.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Daily Caller, the president blamed \u201cpotentially illegal votes\u201d as the reason \u201cRepublicans don\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nHe elaborated without evidence:\n\n\u201cWhen people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles.

Is the president saying buying cereal requires identification? Maybe he\u2019s referencing that some businesses require a photo ID when paying with a personal check? Or maybe he means to suggest that for certain individuals, a box of cereal itself could act as identification (we\u2019re looking at you, Toucan Sam, Tony the Tiger, Cap\u2019n Crunch and that Trix rabbit).\n\nThis is at least the second time the president has suggested identification is needed to buy groceries. In a July rally in Florida, Trump boasted about his supposed knowledge of both identification laws and grocery shopping.\n\n\u201cYou know, if you go out and you want to buy groceries, you need a picture on a card. You need ID,\u201d Trump said at the time.\n\nThe July statement caused even The New York Times to ask: Has this man ever shopped at a grocery store before? The publication talked to close friends and personal associates of Trump, who could not confirm the president has ever shopped at a grocery store.", "The recent Camp fire in California has been declared the deadliest in the state\u2019s history. The devastation is yet another example of the collision of climate-related risks and the human-built environment. Climate change isn\u2019t the singular cause of the Camp, Hill and Woosley fires; however, it has amplified environmental factors (including warmer and dried-out soils) in creating a longer fire season that sets the stage for increased risk. Growth and development have met these environmental factors at what experts call the \u201cwildland-urban interface.\u201d\n\nThe wildland-urban interface (WUI) is defined as the intersection of undeveloped natural land and human-built environment. Here, homes, developments and public infrastructure meet or intermingle with undeveloped, environmentally sensitive areas. It\u2019s created when people migrate farther and farther into \u201cnatural\u201d areas in pursuit of privacy, natural aesthetics, recreational opportunities and more affordable housing. Where there are people, housing follows. And where there is housing, other critical infrastructures and development are needed.\n\nThe WUI is a key factor in identifying the potential for wildfire disaster losses \u2015 California alone has more 4.5 million homes located within the WUI. Growth alone is not necessarily a problem, but poorly planned and unmanaged growth \u2015 particularly in hazardous or risky areas \u2015 can result in catastrophe. Low-density development, such as individual homes, significantly increase the fire-fighting cost, for example. California is not alone in its need to advance policies related to the link between growth management, hazard mitigation and land use; most states have room for improvement (and not just limited to fire \u2015 floods, also).\n\nGrowth alone is not necessarily a problem, but poorly planned and unmanaged growth \u2015 particularly in hazardous or risky areas \u2015 can result in catastrophe.\n\nPhysical vulnerability in a natural hazards context is usually characterized by things like location and proximity of the human-built environment to a hazardous threat. And the western region of the U.S. is historically volatile. This is especially true in California, where fire is a part of the natural ecosystem; a variety of vegetation have adapted to fire, and some reproduce only after a large fire. But when physical risk meets the social environment (including homes and other infrastructure), the human-built environment can also be literal fuel for naturally occurring fires.\n\nBoth windblown embers (small pieces of burning wood) and the flame front (the line of fire moving with the wind and topography) also cause concern in the wildland-urban interface. Because embers, not just direct flame, can destroy structures. And embers may precede the flaming fire front, carried by winds and distributing burning brands or embers across long distances. These embers fall \u2015 or are wind-driven into vegetation around structures or into air vents \u2015 and can go undetected for some time.\n\nUrban and regional planners can help communities achieve smart growth in smarter places. More specifically, planners focused on hazard mitigation can help communities think about growth and development in the context of hazard risks and the vulnerabilities associated with those risks. Planners can also support communities in developing a hazard mitigation plan that includes long-term strategies for protecting people and property from future hazard events.\n\nUrban and regional planners can help communities achieve smart growth in smarter places.\n\nResearch has shown federal policies make little difference in community land-use actions. State policy, on the other hand, exerts a strong influence. Therefore, mitigation and adaptation strategies have to be locally grounded and locally governed. Zoning plays a role in planning as well and most often is carried out at the local municipal level; it regulates the type, location, bulk and density of development and continues to be based on the Standard State Zoning Enabling Act of 1924.\n\nSome of the nation\u2019s earliest zoning laws were motivated by fire. Setback zoning laws were a form of hazard mitigation in which houses were required to have a certain amount of space between them to prevent fires jumping from home to home. In fact, just a few years before SZEA was issued, the city of New York enacted a zoning resolution related to buildings, congestion, living conditions and to reduce the risks of fire. Zoning on a larger scale can be used as a planning tool to regulate growth and establish buffers between hazards (e.g., fire-prone wildlands) and human development.\n\nThe concept of adaptation \u2015 modifying building practices in consideration of climate change and changing environmental conditions \u2015 has grown in popularity over the last two decades. And a community\u2019s wildfire adaptation often sits at the household level. Take California\u2019s WUI building codes, for example. Specifically, the law requires that homeowners reduce vegetation 100 feet (or the property line) around their buildings to create a defensible space for firefighters and to protect their homes from wildfires. Building codes, which include ignition-resistant standards, are thought to protect buildings from being ignited by flying embers.\n\nOf course, a final tool in reducing risk is to incentivize development in lower-risk areas. Higher-density development in urban areas reduces the cost of fire protection and often reduces overall fire risk. Policymakers and planners should develop zoning and land-use policies that guide development away from the riskiest areas.\n\nSome of the nation\u2019s earliest zoning laws were motivated by fire.\n\nCommunities have all of these planning tools at their disposal, but more inclusive and innovative practices are needed to improve wildfire resilience. This means mitigating fire when possible and, when exposure is inevitable, bouncing back \u2015 and bouncing back in such a way that future buildings, structures and systems are more adapted. Communities across the country (including those in California) have already begun this process, but we believe many necessary household- and community-level adaptations have yet to be identified.\n\nPlanners must increasingly provide an opportunity for community members to participate in the development process, not just to voice concerns, but to exchange ideas and practices and find ways to actually implement adaptation strategies. Communities are more resilient when everyone has an opportunity to participate and share their vision for future growth. And as the recent wildfires in California have shown, we all have a stake in this.\n\nMarccus D.

His research interests include infrastructure planning and management, hazard mitigation, and sustainable development.", "As chief executive of Ohio\u2019s fourth-largest city, Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz has limited power to confront gun violence on a national scale. But in the face of an endless barrage of mass shootings and daily gun deaths, he says doing nothing is no longer an option.\n\nUnder a city policy announced last month, between massacres at a Pittsburgh synagogue and at a bar in California, gun and ammunition companies seeking to outfit Toledo\u2019s law enforcement officers will first have to show that they follow what the city has deemed responsible business practices. It will use the following questions to judge potential partners:\n\nDo you manufacture assault weapons for civilian use?\n\nDo you sell assault weapons for civilian use?\n\nWhich firearms does your company agree to not sell to civilians?\n\nDo you require your dealers to conduct background checks?\n\nDoes your company have a plan in place to invest in gun- and ammunition-tracing technologies?\n\nDo you use, at a minimum, industry best practices for inventory control and transactions?\n\nThe policy \u2015 the first of its kind in the U.S. \u2015 will go into effect early next year, when the city begins soliciting bids for contracts for its gun and ammunition needs. The city\u2019s police chief said he agrees with the mayor\u2019s decision, telling Toledo\u2019s The Blade that it is \u201cnot an indictment on the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nKapszukiewicz said he sees his plan as a way to use the free market to tackle gun violence by trying to impose change on the firearm industry, which has long resisted getting involved in divisive debates about how to best prevent shootings.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing is quintessentially American and baked into the capitalist structure that has been a foundation of this country since its founding,\u201d he told HuffPost.\n\nWade Kapszukiewicz Campaign Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz is working to get other U.S. mayors behind a plan to do business exclusively with gun companies that follow responsible practices.\n\nAlthough there are federal regulations designed to control the flow of firearms from manufacturer to buyer, few gun companies go beyond those standards. And when safeguards inevitably falter and guns are diverted onto the black market or used in crimes, manufacturers and dealers are largely shielded from liability under a federal law passed in 2005.\n\nBy creating a financial incentive for responsible behavior, Kapszukiewicz hopes he can get manufacturers to take further steps to address the violence committed with their products.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying this is going to eradicate the problem in our nation or even avoid a tragedy in my own city, but just because we can\u2019t do everything doesn\u2019t mean we can do nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Kapszukiewicz\u2019s ideal world, the U.S. would be taking a multifaceted approach to gun violence, touching on issues of access to firearms, mental health care and even school safety. But with congressional lawmakers showing that they \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d about the bloodshed, firearm manufacturers must be part of the solution, Kapszukiewicz said. And if they won\u2019t step up voluntarily, he\u2019ll try to force their hand.\n\nToledo will likely need help creating the financial pressure necessary to do that. The city spends $150,000 to $175,000 every year on firearms, ammunition and replacement parts, he said \u2014 a tiny fraction of a large gun company\u2019s annual revenue.\n\nBut if other cities follow Toledo\u2019s lead, the movement could have more sway.\n\nAdd the other big cities of Ohio, and \u201cthe $150,000 of free-market pressure that the city of Toledo is going to bring to bear on this problem all of a sudden becomes almost $1 million,\u201d said Kapszukiewicz.\n\nAnd with buy-in from larger cities around the nation, that amount could swell far beyond that.\n\n\u201cWhile the gun companies could easily ignore Toledo and its $150,000 and never miss it, my sense is that they would miss the tens of millions of dollars of business that they would lose from the major cities of America,\u201d he said.\n\nOther mayors have already expressed an interest in joining Kapszukiewicz in his attempt to use cities\u2019 consumer power to encourage better corporate behavior from gun companies, Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley told HuffPost.\n\nCranley chairs the Task Force of Mayors and Police Chiefs under the U.S. Conference of Mayors. He said he\u2019ll be calling a meeting of the committee in the spring to discuss expanding Toledo\u2019s policy nationwide.\n\n\u201cI suspect that we\u2019ll have broad-based support from the mayors and from the chiefs to try to come up with a good behavior model that a majority of us would agree to,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal is for all the members of the conference to sign on.\u201d\n\nCranley will be watching to see how gun companies respond to Toledo\u2019s questionnaire, he said. He added that he intends to reach out to firearm manufacturers for feedback on criteria they could use to craft a national model for the conference to consider.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to believe that at least one of the companies, if not several, are going to want to be responsive,\u201d he said.\n\nBut it\u2019s not yet clear how manufacturers will respond to Kapszukiewicz\u2019s survey.\n\nThe first questions about so-called assault weapons are fairly straightforward. Many of the leading suppliers of law enforcement sidearms also manufacture semiautomatic rifles, which are typically available to civilians, as well as police and military.\n\nSig Sauer, the company that currently makes Toledo\u2019s duty pistols, also manufactures a variety of rifles, including the one used in the 2016 mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Glock, a favorite of U.S. police departments, is one of the few large companies that offer only handguns.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images A rack of Sig Sauer rifles at the company's booth during the National Rifle Association annual meeting in Dallas, May 5.\n\nOther questions on Toledo\u2019s questionnaire are less clear cut. Federal law already stipulates that licensed gun dealers must conduct background checks at the point of sale. But there are loopholes.\n\nThe gunman in the 2015 Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting was able to purchase a handgun before his background check was completed, for example. Walmart is among the retailers that have sought to patch that gap by adopting a policy of denying any gun sale in which the buyer hasn\u2019t been approved by federal authorities. Because manufacturers don\u2019t typically sell their products directly to consumers, they may have limited control over this sort of retail practice.\n\nFederal law has also established guidelines for inventory control and transactions, to be upheld by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said Mike Weisser, a Massachusetts-based gun dealer.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m a federal dealer with a federal license and I ship my gun to another place, I have to keep track of where that gun went,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ATF inspects that.\u201d\n\nThe bureau lays out additional best practices for federally licensed gun dealers to keep track of their wares, but the agency lacks the authority to fully enforce the standards. Most large firearm manufacturers are likely in adherence, said Weisser. But if a company is not, it would be hard to know unless ATF caught it in a specific violation.\n\nQuestions about manufacturer investments in tracing technologies could also pose issues, he said. Mainstream gun companies aren\u2019t investing in those areas, he said, even though California law requires all new handguns sold in the state to be able to microscopically stamp the firearm\u2019s make, model and serial number onto each fired shell casing, allowing police to trace spent ammunition back to individual guns. Weisser argued that mayors might be better off pressing manufacturers on other gun features related to child safety.\n\nThose companies that are doing it poorly will see their market share diminish, or they\u2019ll change their behavior in an effort to win that business. Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz\n\nKapszukiewicz said he understands the initial set of questions may not be perfect. It\u2019s possible the survey will reveal that no gun company fits Toledo\u2019s definition of \u201cresponsible,\u201d he said, or conversely, that all gun companies provide answers to make them look as though they\u2019re already doing everything they can to keep their products out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.\n\nBut in exploring the topic, he said, he was surprised to learn that nobody had done research identifying responsible and irresponsible firearm manufacturers. By establishing a procedure to figure out which companies have the strongest policies, cities \u2015 and consumers more generally \u2015 will be able to make more informed choices about which gunmakers to support.", "The deadly Woolsey fire in Southern California has burned 83 percent of the national parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, Cal Fire said.\n\nThe Santa Monica Mountains are a cherished area of nature outside Los Angeles and near Malibu, offering more than 500 miles of trails.

Britain and the EU agree that there must be no barriers that could disrupt businesses and residents on either side of the border and undermine Northern Ireland\u2019s hard-won peace process.\n\nThe proposed solution involves a common customs arrangement for the U.K. and the EU, to eliminate the need for border checks, with some provisions that are specific to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe solution is intended to be temporary, but pro-Brexit politicians in Britain fear it may become permanent, hampering Britain\u2019s ability to strike new trade deals around the world.\n\nPro-Brexit former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the agreement would make his favored option, a loose Canada-style trade deal with the bloc, impossible. He tweeted: \u201cCabinet must live up to its responsibilities & stop this deal.\u201d\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May\u2019s minority government, said it would oppose any deal that leaves Northern Ireland subject to different rules to the rest of the U.K. after Brexit.\n\n\u201cWe could not as unionists support a deal that broke up the United Kingdom,\u201d DUP leader Arlene Foster said.\n\nMay also faced disquiet from Scottish Conservative lawmakers, worried about what the deal means for Scotland\u2019s important fishing industry.\n\nThe party\u2019s Scottish legislators \u2014 including Scottish Secretary David Mundell, a Cabinet minister \u2014 wrote to May saying Brexit must mean \u201cfull sovereignty over domestic waters\u201d and Britain must leave the EU\u2019s Common Fisheries Policy after Brexit.\n\nMay also faces growing opposition from pro-EU lawmakers, who say her proposed Brexit deal is worse than the status quo and the British public should get a new vote on whether to leave or to stay.\n\nSophie in\u2019t Veld, a Dutch member of the European Parliament who is deputy to the legislature\u2019s Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt, said the real problem during the negotiations \u201clies within the U.K.\u201d because Britain doesn\u2019t know what relationship it wants with the EU.", "JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 An Indonesian woman whose fiance died on a Lion Air flight that plunged into the sea was photographed in her wedding dress and professed her love for him on the day they were to have been married.\n\nIntan Syari\u2019s fiance, Dr. Rio Nanda Pratama, was among 189 people who were killed when the Boeing 737 crashed Oct. 29 shortly after taking off from Jakarta.\n\nSyari and Pratama, both 26, had planned to get married Sunday.

Patekar had been a revered figure in Bollywood for decades and had won numerous awards. Dutta was young and beautiful and relatively new to the industry; she had won the Miss India Universe title a few years prior, and had successfully made the transition into movies.\n\nHer role in the film was a small one, a so-called item number in which she was to dance to one song alongside Patekar. Instead, Dutta says, she was sexually harassed on the job. She alleges that Patekar took over choreography for the song himself and groped her during dance rehearsals. As she left the set later, she was hounded by a mob that smashed the windows of her car. When she stood up for herself, she was fired and replaced by another actress.\n\nThe incident made national news that year, and Dutta explicitly named Patekar as her harasser. But the response, from both the media and the public, was tepid at best.\n\nFast forward to September, when Dutta came forward about the incident once more. This time, after a year of Me Too stories making waves around the globe, she was finally heard. India was catapulted into its own Me Too moment, and hundreds of women used social media to post their accounts of being harassed. They did so in such huge numbers that, in October, when Google Trends released a visualization of the heat generated by Me Too searches around the world, India burned the brightest.\n\nWhen Google Trends released a visualization of the heat generated by Me Too searches around the world, India burned the brightest.\n\nTo date, all of these accusations have come from women with power. They are celebrities, or professional and upper-middle-class women in film, advertising, publishing and journalism. Their stories have exposed truths about men in eminent multinational organizations that, for years, were brushed aside or hidden.\n\nAnd though this is happening a few oceans away from the United States, it has the potential to create seismic changes here. Bollywood puts out an average of 1,000 movies annually, which are consumed by an estimated 2.7 billion people worldwide. What happens there is a matter of global economic and cultural importance.\n\nAlready, Indian companies are toppling amid sexual harassment scandals. A prominent Indian production house, Phantom Films, has dissolved after a co-founder was accused of predatory behavior toward an ex-employee. The company was owned by Reliance Entertainment, part of the Reliance Group, with total assets worth approximately $110 billion. A vast number of Bollywood projects are being pulled. The fourth film in the \u201cHousefull\u201d franchise replaces Patekar, with rumors his scenes are being reshot with a new actor. Even though Patekar only was involved in 10 days worth of footage for this installment, some estimates put the additional cost of the reshoots at about $300,000.\n\n- via Getty Images Indian Bollywood actor Nana Patekar is mobbed by the media as he leaves after making a statement outside his home in Mumbai on Oct. 8.\n\nThough it is challenging to put a rupee or dollar value on the cost of sexual harassment for victims, for large corporations there is a price tag. There are lost hours, lost employees, legal fees and PR for damage control, to say nothing of consumer-driven boycotts.\n\nThere are cultural ripples to consider alongside the economic ones. If the impact of the Me Too movement in the West, and in the U.S. in particular, are any guide, India\u2019s will change a lot of what happens in Indian cinema. That change is desperately needed in Bollywood, which has long normalized traditional gender roles. In 4,000 Hindi movies and 800 trailers released from 1970 to 2017, female roles were both trivialized and used as a lure for cinema audiences, according to an analysis by IBM, IIT and DTU.\n\nIn other words, Bollywood is still using butts and boobs to sell tickets, especially in movie posters, and typically the actresses whose \u201cassets\u201d are on display get less screen time and less money than their male counterparts.\n\nBollywood is still using butts and boobs to sell tickets, and the actresses whose 'assets' are on display get less screen-time and less money than their male counterparts.\n\nAs it is in Hollywood, it\u2019s too soon to say if the changes wrought in India by Me Too will be sweeping or permanent. But whatever those changes are, they won\u2019t stay confined to India. An estimated 16 million Indians \u2015 roughly double the population of New York City \u2015 reside outside India, and the total Indian diaspora amounts to 31.2 million people. In 2017 there were 4.4 million Indian Americans living in the United States. Where once Indian aunties in Chicago might have taken in a traditional Indian rom-com, today they can choose from the increasingly common women-centric Bollywood narratives. And the number of movies that tell women\u2019s stories is projected to increase further in coming years.\n\nStill, Me Too in India has a long, steep road ahead. Though sexual harassment remains a systemic issue, the ability to fight it is restricted to the privileged few in urban areas. Lower-class, and indeed, lower-caste women remain discounted from this conversation and shut out of the changes that result from it. Once Me Too in India is rises above poverty and culture, it will be truly inclusive to all victims.\n\nTanushree Dutta is filing fresh civil and criminal cases as India watches on tenterhooks. Though it\u2019s taken an additional year for India to enter the Me Too era, the impact of the case that sparked a hundred others isn\u2019t just local, it\u2019s global. Like women everywhere, Indian women are angry and, for the first time, vocal.\n\n\u201cI am seeing the women who have suffered with the burden for too long,\u201d Dutta said at a recent event. \u201cI am looking at them as human beings who have now let go of the burden on their chest. I am looking at these souls that are now getting liberated.\u201d", "Jada Pinkett Smith said she will never forget the devastating slurs two white police offers shouted at her when she was younger.\n\n\u201cI remember going to Virginia Beach \u2015 remember when they had the riots?\u201d she asked her mother Adrienne Banfield-Jones, on a recent episode of the Facebook Watch series, \u201cRed Table Talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I was there by myself \u2014 terrified \u2014 trying to get back to my hotel,\u201d the actress added. \u201cI will never forget these two white officers.

To receive TomDispatch in your inbox three times a week, click here.\n\nBy John Feffer\n\nThe mid-term elections are over, and the Democrats have regained the House, but the rest of American political reality remains intact. Meanwhile, the campaigns barely touched on the most important issues of our time: war, climate change, and the fracturing of the international community.\n\nSo, let\u2019s consider these larger issues from a different angle.\n\nLet\u2019s step from the voting booth into a different space altogether: an escape room. This is, however, no ordinary escape room like the ones that have become so popular in cities around the world. Here, the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher: life or death. You might want to give it a pass, but you don\u2019t have a choice. There\u2019s only one door and you have to go inside...\n\nYou\u2019ve done enough escape rooms to know the drill by now. You are escorted into what seems like an ordinary room. There\u2019s a table and a chair. On the table is a book. As soon as you step across the threshold, the door closes behind you. You hear the lock click into place.\n\nYou are now trapped in a room with four strangers. Three of them look as concerned as you are. The fourth is nonchalant.\n\nThe instructions this time are a little different. As with other escape rooms, you have a certain amount of time to figure out how to get out. Also, you know that clues to the puzzle are hidden somewhere in the room. Figure them out and you\u2019ll be able to unlock the door.\n\nBut here\u2019s the difference: the temperature in this room will go up a degree with every minute that passes. If you and those four strangers can\u2019t figure out how to stop it from rising, you\u2019ll succumb to heat stroke. In other words, if you don\u2019t escape in the allotted time period, you\u2019ll die.\n\nYou immediately set to work looking for the clues. Maybe one or two are in the book on the table or maybe a code is carved on the underside of the table. Maybe you need to use the chair to climb up close enough to scrutinize the crown molding near the ceiling. Three of the strangers are doing what you\u2019re doing: trying to uncover clues.\n\nThe fourth is leaning against the wall, looking relaxed. \u201cIt\u2019s just a joke,\u201d he says to no one in particular.\n\n\u201cI already feel it getting warmer in here,\u201d you respond.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just your imagination,\u201d he replies. \u201cPower of suggestion. Fake news.\u201d\n\nThe clock is already ticking. It can\u2019t be your imagination. It\u2019s definitely hotter in the room than when you first entered. You\u2019re sweating. Everyone\u2019s sweating, even the leaning man. \u201cTemperatures naturally fluctuate,\u201d he comments. \u201cIt might be going up now, but it will go down again. Count on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him,\u201d says the teenager in your group. \u201cHe\u2019s just a jerk.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s right and there\u2019s no time to try to persuade him either. The four of you are now uncovering one clue after another, which brings you to the truly challenging part: cracking the code. Each of you contributes something: the teenager quickly solves a quadratic equation, the stay-at-home mom translates that Japanese phrase, and the aging literature professor recognizes the quote from Dante\u2019s Inferno.\n\nAnd once the four of you use this code to open a panel you\u2019ve discovered beneath a loose floorboard, you finally get the chance to apply your engineering knowhow to the situation. You personally figure out how to reset the thermostat hidden inside it and so manage to slow the rise in temperature. It\u2019s not much perhaps, but it\u2019s a start.\n\nYou\u2019re working smoothly together now. Only through cooperation have you been able to get this far. Problem is, it\u2019s still too warm in the room. The 70-something professor is now crumpled in the corner, breathing heavily. You only have one bottle of water to share and a couple of nutrition bars and there are still more puzzles to solve. The teenager is urging you on \u2015 and little wonder, she has her whole life ahead of her.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch. You\u2019re getting tired, all of you.\n\nThis Hot Room is only the latest and greatest challenge you\u2019ve faced. You\u2019ve been doing escape rooms now for what seems like decades, each challenge evidently more urgent than the last.\n\nYou were relatively young when you first stumbled into this craze. In the War Room, you were trapped with two heavily armed men pointing high-powered weapons at each other. In the Pandemic Room, you were all infected with a deadly virus and had to find an antidote. Most recently, you were locked in the Autocrat Room with a raving narcissist who believed he was the king of the world and who had his finger on a very real button that could destroy you, him, and everyone else.\n\nYet somehow you managed to extricate yourself from each of those rooms \u2015 only to find yourself trapped in this one. You should be tired!\n\nYou can\u2019t even believe it: Only now is the reality of it all beginning to dawn on you \u2015 that you\u2019ve been proceeding through a series of nested escape rooms, boxes within boxes, that have led you here, to the ultimate box.\n\nIn this Hot Room, time is running out, resources are scarce, and you have to listen to an idiot leaning against a wall doing nothing, and acting as if this were a delightful sauna, not a potential coffin.\n\nYou suspect that this is the human condition, this endless succession of crises. Civilizations have risen and fallen throughout history. One culture after another has failed to figure out the riddle inscribed in its environment. Some didn\u2019t even realize that they were on the verge of collapse until it was too late.\n\nBut this is different. Each previous time, it was just one part of the globe \u2015 the Mycenaeans, the Khmer, the Mayans, the Romans \u2015 that grappled with its communal fate.\n\nNow, you\u2019re addressing the fate of the planet. This Hot Room, you\u2019ve come to realize, is Earth itself. And there\u2019s nothing on the other side of the door except the cold, cold void.\n\nTo solve the riddle of this ultimate escape room means performing a genuine miracle. You have to stop the temperature from rising. You have to multiply the water bottles and the nutrition bars. Most challenging of all perhaps, you have to prevent everyone from giving in to despair.\n\nSo, you take time out to do what you\u2019ve always done in such situations. You did it at work to rally your discouraged colleagues. You did it for your children at bedtime to dispel the nightly terrors.\n\nYou tell a story.\n\nA Matryoshka of Dystopias\n\nMy novel Splinterlands was an exploration of one particular dystopian path: the nationalist fragmentation of the world into ever-smaller splinters. This was no far-fetched fantasy when I wrote it, just an extrapolation, circa early 2016, from ongoing trends: tensions within the European Union, the polarization of politics in the United States, the rise of far-right parties, the widening global gap between the rich and the poor.\n\nUnfortunately, those trends only intensified after I finished the manuscript. It hadn\u2019t actually been my intention to predict. Like any politically engaged dystopian novel, Splinterlands was meant to be a warning. I knew things could get that bad. I just didn\u2019t think they would \u2015 not so quickly anyway.\n\nEven before the book came out, Britain had voted to leave the European Union and then, more improbably yet, Donald Trump managed to win the 2016 presidential election. Instead of being weird exceptions, the Trump-Brexit developments turned out to be part of a terrifying trajectory. Since then, the far right has assumed positions of power in Austria, Italy, and now Brazil. It has done well in elections in Germany and Sweden. In France, the extremist National Front is now, according to pollsters, the country\u2019s most popular party.\n\nGet on a train today in Poland, heading for North Korea, and you\u2019ll pass through an enormous swath of territory ruled by fake democrats and authentic autocrats. An illiberal axis connects this great expanse of Eurasia to Turkey, Israel, India, the Philippines, Colombia, and Nicaragua. The military or one-party governments hold sway over much of Southeast Asia. Religious zealots and strong-arm leaders rule the greater part of the Middle East. Democracy is weak in most African countries and non-existent in others.\n\nTogether, these illiberal forces are deeply suspicious of any transnational authority that demands they adhere to global human rights norms and international standards.\n\nThe international community, never a particularly robust entity, is beginning to evaporate. Countries are withdrawing from international agreements like the Global Pact for Migration and organizations like the International Criminal Court. With its high-profile exits, Donald Trump\u2019s America has done its best to undermine the Paris accord on climate change and the U.N. Human Rights Council. It\u2019s not quite a rush to the exits, nor is this retreat into sovereign parochialism irreversible \u2015 not yet anyway. But the Splinterlands scenario of the total collapse of the international order and the fragmentation of countries like the United States and China has become incrementally more likely.\n\nMeanwhile, global inequality continues to worsen. According to Oxfam, \u201c82% of the wealth created last year went to the richest one percent of the global population, while the 3.7 billion people who make up the poorest half of humanity got nothing.\u201d Facilitated by financial deregulation, corruption has become rampant, registering as a serious problem in two-thirds of the world\u2019s countries, according to the latest Transparency International report. The media are under attack even in traditionally liberal countries like the United States.\n\nAnd surveillance by the state and corporate conglomerates like Facebook has become commonplace. In China, the two forces are working hand in hand under the auspices of the phone app WeChat. Chinese use the application to shop, listen to music, and exchange messages. But the app also assigns users a score based on everything from online behavior to how they drive their cars, and if that score is too low, they\u2019re locked out of certain jobs, travel opportunities, and schools. The system should be fully operational and exportable in a couple of years.\n\nThese various real-world dystopian scenarios are not discrete. They are indeed nested in one another, like one of those Russian matryoshka dolls that open only to reveal smaller versions of itself, each inside the next. Just as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once characterized Soviet Russia as \u201ca riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma,\u201d think of the current reality as never-ending wars wrapped in nuclear proliferation inside nationalist fragmentation enclosed in climate change.\n\nThis last challenge is, of course, the most urgent, transcending politics as it does. Governments of every political flavor have contributed to it and continue to dither in the face of an obviously looming catastrophe, while economic greed prevents any sustainable solution. In other words, we\u2019re heading for a true existential reckoning. Heat up the planet enough and there won\u2019t be any more politics or economics. It will be the real end of history, not the triumphalist one that Francis Fukuyama thought up in 1989 in anticipation of the end of the Cold War.\n\nIn Splinterlands, I still saw climate change as one part of an overall ecosystem of threat. In my new dystopian novel, Frostlands, climate change takes center stage. A stand-alone sequel set in 2051, the moment when Splinterlands ended, it focuses on Rachel Leopold, an aging climatologist, living in Arcadia, a sustainable community in what was once part of Vermont. Arcadia is now under attack by unknown forces and Rachel is worried that those attacks are directed at her. She\u2019s been conducting experiments in secret to regenerate the Arctic ice cap in a desperate bid to enclose the remaining methane gas trapped in the permafrost. But (as in our world today) not everyone shares her urgent desire to stop climate change.\n\nAs with Splinterlands, the dystopia of Frostlands is, in fact, unspooling in real life on an accelerated basis. As environmentalist Elizabeth Kolbert wrote in a recent New Yorker:\n\n\u201dArctic soils contain hundreds of billions of tons of carbon, in the form of frozen and only partially decomposed plants. As the region heats up, much of this carbon is likely to be released into the atmosphere, where it will trap more heat... In the Arctic Ocean, vast stores of methane lie buried under frozen sediments. If these stores, too, are released, the resulting warming is likely to be catastrophic.\u201d\n\nKolbert then quotes Peter Wadhams, an ice specialist: \u201cThe risk of an Arctic seabed methane pulse is one of the greatest immediate risks facing the human race.\u201d\n\nWhy wait until 2051 when you can experience apocalypse now?\n\nEvolutionary Dead-End?\n\nA climatologist, a nuclear physicist, and an epidemiologist walk into a bar.\n\nThe bartender gestures to the three tiers of bottles arrayed behind her. \u201cPick your poison.\u201d\n\nThe three professionals laugh ruefully. The climate scientist links arms with her two colleagues and says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you pick your poison?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no joke.\n\nIn a culture that emphasizes free choice \u2015 among political candidates, breakfast cereals, and Internet avatars \u2015 we now face the ultimate choice. We can choose our dystopian future. We can cut funding for medical research and emergency response and increase our vulnerability to the next plague. We can elect leaders who have itchy nuclear fingers and increase the likelihood that we go out with a bang. Or, if we somehow make it out of those particular escape rooms, we can drink the ultimate poison and heat up the planet until it can no longer sustain anything but cockroaches.\n\nFor some, the inexcusable slowness with which the international community is addressing climate change \u2015 along with the other apocalyptic scenarios \u2015 is yet more proof that humans, like dinosaurs, have outlived their evolutionary usefulness. It\u2019s hard not to feel that all of humanity deserves a Darwin award when you see the effects of recent superstorms, the vanishing of polar ice, the heedless drilling for oil and gas everywhere, and the dilatory efforts of even sensibly led countries like South Korea to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nDinosaurs, of course, couldn\u2019t put up much of a fight against the asteroid that slammed into Earth 66 million years ago and the cataclysms that followed. You, however, can still tell the bartender, \u201cThanks, but no thanks, on the poison tonight.\u201d You can still solve the riddle of the Hot Room and hope that the next challenge won\u2019t be quite as apocalyptic.\n\nRemember: there\u2019s always going to be some guy leaning against the wall, making light of your efforts to save the world. It\u2019s maddening to have to listen to him. So, like Odysseus, you must close your ears to the siren songs of what passes for pragmatism today. The politics of the possible don\u2019t stand much chance in an impossible situation.\n\nIn that Hot Room, everyone but the skeptic is back to work, even the aging professor. Your story has inspired them to attempt the impossible: to work together, to solve the riddle, to overcome the resistance. They know the odds. They understand that they\u2019re already living in a dystopia.\n\nBut now you\u2019ve given them reason to believe that even dystopias can have sequels.\n\nJohn Feffer, a TomDispatch regular, is the author of the dystopian novel Splinterlands and the director of Foreign Policy In Focus at the Institute for Policy Studies.

Then, we will rebuild.\u201d\n\nCamp Hess Kramer and Gindling Hilltop Camp, both associated with Los Angeles\u2019 historic Wilshire Boulevard Temple, sustained significant damage after the Woolsey fire passed through over the weekend.\n\nOther Jewish summer camps in Malibu also reported damage from the flames \u2015 including Camp JCA Shalom, which is run by the Shalom Institute, a Jewish education and retreat center.\n\nThe Woolsey fire has swept through 97,000 acres of Ventura and Los Angeles counties, destroying about 435 homes and businesses, the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday morning. At least two people have died in that wildfire.\n\nIn Northern California, 48 people were confirmed dead Tuesday night after the Camp fire ripped through the town of Paradise. Many more are still missing. The fire is now the deadliest in the state\u2019s modern history.\n\nCourtesy of Wilshire Boulevard Temple Camps Camp leaders pledged that the fire wouldn\u2019t stop the community from gathering this summer.\n\nLeaders of the Wilshire Boulevard Temple Camps announced on Facebook that nearly all the buildings at the site were lost. No one was hurt in the blaze, since the camps were evacuated late Thursday, along with their Torah scrolls, camp director Seth Toybes told HuffPost in an email late Tuesday night.\n\nSince 1952, generations of Jewish Americans have attended the Wilshire Boulevard Temple Camps, forging lifelong friendships and memories while learning how to be proud of their religious traditions. The camps became a prototype for other Jewish summer camps across the nation.\n\nThe camps were the brainchild of the temple\u2019s Rabbi Alfred Wolf, a prominent Jewish and interfaith leader who escaped Germany in 1935 as anti-Semitism was rising in his homeland. In 1950 he rented Presbyterian facilities and organized a summer camp for Jewish youths in Los Angeles.\n\nThe rented camp had many crosses on its property. So when Wolf opened Camp Hess Kramer at its current location in 1952, its leaders erected wooden menorahs around the site. Toybes said that through this ancient Jewish symbol, the leaders wanted to remind campers that \u201cthis was a safe place for Jews to be free.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States granted Jews freedoms of practice that stood in stark contrast to Nazi Germany and our founders were proud of that,\u201d Toybes said.\n\nOver the years, the camps also became a beloved retreat for non-Jewish youths \u2015 including young leaders in the Chicano movement of the 1960s.\n\nThe Wilshire Boulevard Temple Camps\u2019 menorah before the fire:\n\nMany of the wooden menorahs erected around the site, including Camp Hess Kramer\u2019s last surviving original menorah, were destroyed in the fire, Toybes said. He added that the metal and concrete outdoor menorah likely survived because it was built to withstand the elements.\n\nOver the years, that menorah has become a symbol of the camp community.\n\n\u201cThe menorah stands on our hillside as a symbol to our campers, staff and others that we are Jewish and proud of this,\u201d Toybes said.\n\nIn the wake of the Woolsey fire, he said, he thinks the menorah is helping the community rally together.\n\n\u201cI believe that people are not only feeling inspired that it survived the blaze but emboldened to rebuild this space that has meant so much to so many, Jews and non Jews alike over the years,\u201d Toybes wrote.\n\nAlumni of the camps have been posting on social media to mourn the destruction and reminisce about their time there.\n\ni spent several summers at #CampHessKramer as a kid. this is absolutely devastating and it\u2019s amazing that the menorah is still standing. it\u2019s a beacon of hope and a reminder of our toughness. we will come back from this...we always do. #WoolseyFire #California https://t.co/cvlHuaP2Z9 \u2014 jessica b (@pennylane586) November 12, 2018\n\nSo sad..generations of Jewish families remember this camp with great fondness, including me and my son.. \u2014 Michael Hiltzik (@hiltzikm) November 13, 2018\n\n2.

He urged the community to remain hopeful.", "WASHINGTON \u2015 Now that Republicans have lost the House, we can finally bury the mysterious tax cut that President Donald Trump said would pass sometime around Election Day \u2015 a pledge that perplexed virtually everyone else.\n\nWhen Trump in October initially broached the prospect of a \u201cmajor tax cut for middle-income people,\u201d nobody in Congress or the White House could offer details on it. But after several days of speculation, Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), the chairman of the House tax committee, said Republicans would only pass a new tax cut if they kept control of both congressional chambers.\n\nSince it seemed unlikely Republicans would keep the House, Brady\u2019s condition essentially amounted to an escape from questions about the proposal, which only Trump had talked about but which not even he could explain.\n\nAs for whether the tax cut even existed or was simply a political ploy by a president known to make up stuff, Brady insisted on Wednesday that it was based on some vague semblance of reality.\n\n\u201cIn truth, we\u2019ve been working with the president for some time and had developed some good options for him,\u201d he told HuffPost.\n\nTrump had said that unlike last year\u2019s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2015 which benefited all income groups but especially the wealthy \u2015 the new bill would be just for the middle class. HuffPost asked Brady how that would work, exactly \u2015 would it be a rate reduction? A deduction? A credit?\n\n\u201cJust generally a focus on middle-class families and workers,\u201d Brady said.\n\nWhen Trump first mentioned the tax cut, Brady\u2019s office referred questions to the White House, but administration aides had nothing to say about it. Pressed for details in the Oval Office by reporters, Trump referred questions to Kevin Hassett, his top economic adviser. But Hassett referred questions back to Trump. No additional details ever emerged.\n\nBrady said he hoped the new Democratic majority in the House would be open to more cuts.", "Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos\u2019 deal for the Queens complex is expected to create 25,000 jobs, but the tabloid\u2019s front page Wednesday seemed to jab at the generous welcome wagon for the commerce company.", "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you.", "Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro was met by activists chanting, \u201cReagan\u2019s dead\u201d and \u201cJohn McCain\u2019s dead,\u201d when he arrived for a speaking engagement Tuesday night at Ohio State University.\n\nThe editor-in-chief of The Daily Wire and former Breitbart writer is currently on a college tour sponsored by Young America\u2019s Foundation to talk about \u201cconservative ideas\u201d that are \u201cin demand.\u201d His previous speaking engagements have also drawn protests.\n\nLeftist protesters chant \"Reagan's dead\" and \"John McCain's dead\" outside Ben Shapiro's lecture at Ohio State University pic.twitter.com/tP32oct6mF \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) November 14, 2018\n\nProtesters against Ben Shapiro have arrived pic.twitter.com/3tyLxhLytY \u2014 Edward Sutelan (@EdwardSutelan) November 14, 2018\n\nBefore the event, the student advisory council of Ohio State\u2019s Morrill Scholars Program issued a message to students imploring them to \u201cseek a safe environment\u201d if they \u201cdo not feel comfortable\u201d around Shapiro\u2019s \u201crhetoric.\u201d\n\n\u201cShapiro\u2019s rhetoric has the potential to threaten the emotional and mental safety of much of the campus community.

A staggering 95 percent of these cases were never covered by national or international media, UIHI revealed Wednesday in its new report.\n\nThe oldest of the victims was 83. The youngest, an infant. Nearly 100 cases were tied to domestic violence, sexual assault or police brutality. The circumstances surrounding many of the other deaths and disappearances remain unknown.\n\nThese data were collected from cities that were known to have Native populations in 29 states. Some two-thirds of the cases that UIHI managed to find were from the last decade, although the oldest case dated back to 1943.\n\nThe 500-plus number likely represents a gross undercount, the Seattle-based tribal epidemiology center noted. The limited available information at various law enforcement agencies, and in some cases, the complete lack of it, speaks volumes about the racist attitudes surrounding indigenous issues in America, UIHI said.\n\n\u201cOur women and our children, our girls, they hold such value within our communities,\u201d said Abigail Echo-Hawk, the chief research officer at the Seattle Indian Health Board and the director of UIHI. \u201cFor us to let their deaths to just go unnoticed \u2014 for people not to know that we have missing women in our communities, for their voices not to be heard \u2014 to me was unacceptable.\u201d\n\nUIHI faced significant challenges over the past year while trying to gather information. Almost half of municipal police departments either failed to respond within the set time limit or failed to respond at all, the report said, and 15 percent cited an inability to search for American Indian, Native American or Alaska Native people in their data systems. Searching news reports, social media, missing persons databases and other sources, UIHI added up more than 150 cases, dubbed \u201cthe invisible 153,\u201d that did not even exist in police records.\n\nFor too long, data has been about other people telling Native people who we are. Annita Lucchesi, cartographer and doctoral intern at the Urban Indian Health Institute\n\nAnnita Lucchesi, a cartographer and doctoral intern at UIHI, worked with the center to count the missing and murdered indigenous women in the 71 selected cities. It\u2019s an issue close to Lucchesi\u2019s heart: Ashley Loring Heavyrunner, one of her former students from Blackfeet Community College in Browning, Montana, has been missing for more than a year. Heavyrunner vanished from Montana\u2019s Blackfeet Reservation on June 7, 2017, at age 20.\n\n\u201cFor too long, data has been about other people telling Native people who we are,\u201d said Lucchesi. \u201cIt\u2019s time we tell the world who we are, and that the world actually listens to us.\u201d\n\nIn 2016 alone, 5,712 cases of missing Native women nationwide \u2015 in cities, towns and rural areas \u2015 were reported to the National Crime Information Center. Just 116 of them were logged in the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s missing persons database, according to UIHI\u2019s report. Despite the sobering scope of the crisis, relatively little action has been taken at a political level.\n\nIn 2017, Democrats introduced a bill known as Savanna\u2019s Act that is still pending in the U.S. House of Representatives. Named after 22-year-old Savanna Greywind of the Spirit Lake Tribe, who was killed while pregnant in 2017, the bill was designed in part to increase and improve data collection for cases of missing and murdered indigenous women. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who introduced the bill in the Senate, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who co-sponsored it, unveiled UIHI\u2019s report on Wednesday in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cWhen I introduced Savanna\u2019s Act, one of the main goals was to raise the issue of missing and murdered indigenous women to a national level and begin the conversation of how to address it. ... With today\u2019s report and the Senate Indian Affairs Committee moving forward on Savanna\u2019s Act, we\u2019re taking important steps toward finally raising the awareness needed to save lives and tackle this horrible epidemic,\u201d Heitkamp said in a statement.\n\nToo often, Echo-Hawk said, Native women and girls go missing \u201cthree times\u201d \u2015 in life, in data and in the media. \u201cTheir deaths are only visible to their families and to their communities who hold that grief, that hardship. And yet nobody sees it but them,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother area where indigenous women and girls have been noticeably absent is in the global Me Too movement. More than 4 in 5 American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence in their lifetimes, including more than half who have experienced sexual violence, according to a 2016 study funded by the National Institute of Justice. More than 1 in 3 had experienced violence in the past year.\n\n\u201cThe epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women in Indian country touches everybody in the community,\u201d said Bree Black Horse, an attorney with the law firm of Galanda Broadman, who works to protect the civil rights of tribal individuals. \u201cAs Indian people, we all know somebody who has been murdered or who has gone missing or had been the victim of violence.\u201d\n\nThe Me Too movement \u201capplies to Native American women, but not in the same way,\u201d Black Horse added. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to worry about things like equal pay and fair treatment in the workplace when, as a Native American woman, at times you\u2019re just trying to survive.\u201d", "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

With his new movie, the director behind 2014\u2019s Best Picture winner, \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d is channeling one of the most famous films ever made.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much that Steve McQueen\u2019s \u201cWidows\u201d borrows beats from \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d though both are crime sagas that feature threatening mobsters, brutal shootouts and calamitous betrayals. No, it\u2019s more about the movies\u2019 shared \u201ccommunal scope,\u201d as McQueen put it when we talked last week. He wants \u201cWidows\u201d to have the same universal appeal as Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s masterpiece.\n\nStarring a blue book of Hollywood\u2019s finest, \u201cWidows\u201d twists and turns with fist-pumping electricity, indicting capitalism, American politics and racist police without needing a single sermon to drive home its messages \u2015 unless, that is, you count a TED Talk-worthy admonishment from Viola Davis: \u201cWe have a lot to do; crying isn\u2019t on the list.\u201d\n\nCo-written with \u201cGone Girl\u201d and \u201cSharp Objects\u201d savant Gillian Flynn, \u201cWidows\u201d follows four women uniting to pull off the heist that killed their husbands and saddled them with debts. At the center is Davis\u2019 Veronica, a strong-willed Chicagoan married to the ill-fated thieves\u2019 ringleader (Liam Neeson). Davis is joined by Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki and Cynthia Erivo, who are pitted against corrupt lawmakers (Colin Farrell, Robert Duvall), menacing crime chiefs (Daniel Kaluuya, Brian Tyree Henry) and other assorted bystanders (Carrie Coon, Jacki Weaver, Jon Bernthal, a fluffy white dog).\n\nThe project underscores how much McQueen\u2019s style and sensibilities have shape-shifted across each of his four movies. \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d elevated the 49-year-old British filmmaker\u2019s profile, but he first drew art-house audiences with 2008\u2019s \u201cHunger\u201d (a drama about the 1981 Irish hunger strike) and 2011\u2019s \u201cShame\u201d (a stark portrait of a sex addict featuring a highly naked Michael Fassbender). \u201cWidows\u201d is a ballpark away from any of those, less a meditation and more a decree.\n\nMcQueen, chipper and eloquent, called me last week to discuss \u201cWidows,\u201d which premiered to raves at the Toronto International Film Festival in September and opens in theaters Nov. 16. We talked about Davis and Neeson\u2019s intense make-out scene, Trumpian parallels and why McQueen wanted this to be his version of \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d\n\nOf your movies, \u201cWidows\u201d has the most obvious commercial appeal. Does it feel like a different experience for you?\n\nYes, it does. The biggest ingredient missing when you finish a movie, of course, is the audience. The response we\u2019ve gotten, basically since Toronto, has been amazing. I think the audiences are responding to it as a group. It\u2019s like being on a roller coaster ride, where people watching the movie are gasping and cheering and applauding and laughing. It\u2019s like an added soundtrack to the movie that obviously isn\u2019t there when you\u2019re making it. I can\u2019t think of the word. What\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for? Oh God, I can\u2019t even think of the word! It\u2019s been \u2014 OK, how do I say this? I\u2019m trying to get the right sentence. It\u2019s almost like audiences have been responding in unison. That\u2019s the word. Thank God for that. Found it in the end.\n\nFox Liam Neeson and Viola Davis in \"Widows.\"\n\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning, with the opening shot. It\u2019s a striking image that immediately grabs people because it\u2019s so intimate: Viola and Liam in bed, really going at each other\u2019s faces. How did the three of you arrive at what that passion would look like in that very first moment?\n\nFirstly and foremostly, I think they enjoyed being together as actors who appreciate each other. It\u2019s one of those things where I just said, \u201cGo for it. Get your tongues out!\u201d I needed to establish from the very beginning of the picture that these two middle-aged people were passionately in love with each other. You have to have that stamp from the immediate beginning of the picture to put into effect the relationship and the meaning of that relationship and the passion and love they have for each other \u2015 and that was through the kissing. Also, I enjoyed looking at it. It\u2019s quite good. There you go.\n\nIt\u2019s also gripping because you juxtapose their romance with a raucous, violent shootout. What does that dichotomy mean to you?\n\nFor me, it\u2019s like a caress and a slap, a caress and a slap. Just as you get comfortable, you get woken up. That was what I was interested in going for, to throw the audience from one side of the cinema to the other side of the cinema. Again, when you enter into that space, even if you\u2019re there with your popcorn and your soda, it\u2019s, \u201cOh, I\u2019m in.\u201d We use that to get the audience into the picture in the initial opening scenes, basically.\n\nIt\u2019s quiet versus chaos, which is interesting in relation to your previous movies. \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d for obvious historical reasons, was labeled an important movie. Typically that\u2019s a calling card for art-house films and Oscar darlings. I think, in 2018 especially, \u201cWidows\u201d has a certain importance about it too \u2014 and it\u2019s still very much a twisty crowd-pleaser with blockbuster appeal. Were you conscious of blending those sensibilities?\n\nYes, I was, in a way. When people think of \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d or when people think of \u201cChinatown,\u201d you can go from some sort of accountant to some guy working in a florist\u2019s shop or a bookshop, or someone working as a top lawyer somewhere, or what have you, and it doesn\u2019t matter. [It could be] a guy working as a construction worker. All those guys will be interested in those movies. It has a certain communal scope. It doesn\u2019t matter where you come from; everybody\u2019s going to be looking at that picture. And that\u2019s what I wanted. I wanted to make a picture that could be seen as high or seen as low. And also, the fact of the matter is that the larger matter is whether it\u2019s good or bad. End of story. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Wong Kar-wai or, I don\u2019t know, who\u2019s the most commercial filmmaker out there? Spielberg? I don\u2019t know. Doesn\u2019t matter to me.\n\nAlso, what I wanted to do was make a roller coaster ride of a movie. What I mean by that is, in every heist picture, as soon as it\u2019s moving, you know there\u2019s going to be this journey. Therefore, I wanted to take the audience on this roller coaster ride through this political, social environment. All the dips and swirls, all of that stuff, when you\u2019re in that situation as an audience member, you know there\u2019s going to be some kind of comeuppance at a certain point.\n\nFox Viola Davis and Cynthia Erivo in \"Widows.\"\n\nThe heist movie is a familiar genre, but \u201cWidows\u201d twists its tropes. Here, the heist is a necessity instead of an act of showmanship. Did you study other heist films to consider what to emulate \u2014 or, more specifically, what not to emulate?\n\nNo, not at all. It was the story. It\u2019s like anything else. Genres are meant to be broken. Before there was a heist, it was something else. It was just about how you break rules. So I wasn\u2019t thinking about, \u201cThis is a heist movie and that\u2019s not.\u201d I was thinking, \u201cWhat\u2019s a good picture and what\u2019s not?\u201d These women\u2019s husbands died in an attempted heist, and the women have to pick up the reins. I take the nucleus of that narrative and place it in Chicago. So to study heist movies doesn\u2019t do any good for me because it\u2019s about tension, it\u2019s about suspense, it\u2019s about timing, it\u2019s about pacing, it\u2019s about performances within those spaces.\n\nWhen \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d came out, you talked about finding sympathy in the Michael Fassbender character, a brutal slave owner, and not seeing him merely as a monster. In a year like this, do you feel similarly about Colin Farrell\u2019s character in \u201cWidows,\u201d a corrupt legacy politician who uses Chicago\u2019s have-nots for gain? The same goes for Colin\u2019s farther, played by Robert Duvall.\n\nWell, did I use the word \u201csympathy\u201d? I don\u2019t think I did use the word \u201csympathy.\u201d\n\nNo, I\u2019m extrapolating a bit. You said you saw him as a \u201chuman being\u201d instead of a \u201cdevil.\u201d\n\nSure, I don\u2019t shy away from that. He does bad things, but he doesn\u2019t understand why. It\u2019s a similar thing with Colin. He has empathy, to a certain extent, even if he\u2019s a person you completely disagree with. You can\u2019t tell the truth with one-dimensional characters. In some ways, I kind of pity someone like Mulligan, Colin Farrell\u2019s character. He has an inkling of what\u2019s going on, but somehow he\u2019s been forced down this road \u2014 maybe by his father, maybe by his assistant, but also by himself. Even if he knows better, he\u2019s found the correct path to succeed.\n\nFox Colin Farrell in \"Widows.\"\n\nRobert Duvall\u2019s character evokes the sort of archetypal white, male, old-guard politician who rants about illegal immigrants. Or, framed differently, he evokes, say, Donald Trump. Some people will certainly read it that way because of what\u2019s going in America at the moment. Was that intentional?\n\nI think it\u2019s always been there. Ten years ago, 20 years ago \u2014 it\u2019s always been there. It\u2019s nothing new, so I didn\u2019t have to flex my muscle or think that hard or think of Trump to do it. But also, for Robert Duvall, he\u2019s a survival character. Check out Chicago. Jesus Christ, who\u2019s that notorious mayor of Chicago? Richard Daley, for example. And there are more around the country, and others in Europe. That kind of nepotism having a grip on power is nothing new.\n\nAlso, you have to understand that character. He can\u2019t be a one-dimensional character. This is a person whose wife died at an early age, and he\u2019s raising a son. There are all kind of expectations being put on his future.\n\nThinking of him as a survivalist is an interesting angle. The thing I love about \u201cWidows\u201d is that it\u2019s a movie full of paradoxes. One of the more humorous juxtapositions is Viola Davis\u2019 fluffy white dog. Here she is getting roped into this outsize crime, which itself has ties to all this inner-city corruption, and the dog ends up exemplifying her everdayness. She won\u2019t do anything without making sure it\u2019s cared for.\n\nIt\u2019s all she has. She\u2019s lost her husband \u2014 and something else, but we can\u2019t talk about that. It\u2019s the only thing she has. I\u2019m happy people are laughing, but the importance of that dog is that it softens her. A lot of people could think Verionica is a bit of a B-I-T-C-H person because of the weight of her recent past, which we have no idea about, but we find out later on. The dog softens her in a very subliminal way: OK, she does have this thing she cares for. It\u2019s a huge plot piece in the picture. Also, at the beginning of the picture I said, \u201cWell, we have to have her put the dog in a kennel because she doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019s going to come back or not.\u201d So yes, I love that people will realize there\u2019s a reason and a purpose for this \u2014 it\u2019s not an expensive accessory; it\u2019s a really important piece in her life, and in the picture\u2019s narrative. I love that sort of disguise.\n\nFilmmakers often say you shouldn\u2019t work with children or animals. How was the dog on the set?\n\nBeautiful. Viola, I think, wanted to keep her. She was a great dog, a wonderful dog. I just love the fact that when you first look at it, you think nothing of it, and all of a sudden it becomes bigger than your first impression. There\u2019s a lot of icebergs in this picture. That\u2019s what\u2019s keeping people stimulated and excited.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s interesting about this picture is a lot of people have said to me how much they want to see it again. Like a roller coaster ride, first you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. Then you know what\u2019s going to happen, and even with the anticipation, you get another thrill. That\u2019s why I made this picture for 200 or 500 or 1,000 people. I didn\u2019t make it for some person with a laptop popping in and out of the fridge every five minutes. It was very important to me to have that response from the audience. It is a group-participation picture.\n\nI\u2019m sure that\u2019s something you didn\u2019t hear a lot with your previous films. They\u2019re much tougher to watch, emotionally.\n\nThe thing about it is, people label you as soon as you come out the door. I\u2019ve only made three pictures before this one! This is my fourth picture! And people like to have an idea of who you are before you\u2019re able to make any grounds. People say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s not like a Steve McQueen picture.\u201d Well, man, I\u2019m just starting. I need to actually get somewhere first before you start thinking about what kind of person or filmmaker I am.\n\nFox Daniel Kaluuya and Brian Tyree Henry in \"Widows.\"\n\nYou\u2019re not ready for the quote-unquote \u201cSteve McQueen picture\u201d to be a crystallized idea that gets perpetuated as if you were someone like Spielberg, who\u2019s made a movie almost every year for four decades.\n\nFor sure. The whole idea of being labeled is disconcerting anyway. As an artist, you\u2019re always looking and trying to find some sort of reasons to sacrifice a lot. You leave your family behind, your friends behind, and go to live in another city for a year or so.\n\nEven if you\u2019re not ready for people to make conclusions about your body of work, something each of your movies has is a striking scene captured in one long take: Michael Fassbender talking about the strike in \u201cHunger\u201d and running in \u201cShame,\u201d Chiwetel Ejiofor with the noose around his neck in \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d and now the Colin Farrell shot in \u201cWidows\u201d that pans from low-rent Chicago to all the privileged mansions mere blocks away. Is there a throughline with these senes? Do they have anything in common beyond the technique?\n\nNo, not at all. What happens is that I never put a stencil on a situation. I don\u2019t come at a situation and say, \u201cI will do this in this shot, and this in that shot.\u201d Basically, it\u2019s what the narrative is saying and how it needs to be shot. So the whole idea of a tracking shot is like having a two-shot or an over-the-shoulder shot; for me, it\u2019s just that. It doesn\u2019t mean anything other than, \u201cWhat is the best way of depicting that particular part of the narrative?\u201d It\u2019s not about me flexing my muscles and saying, \u201cLook what I can do.\u201d How can it serve the story better? Because that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\n\nIf I make a film where that doesn\u2019t happen, great. Maybe I\u2019ll make a film where there\u2019s not an over-the-shoulder shot. But because that is much more seen as conventional, people don\u2019t raise their eyebrows at it or bring attention to it.

Like many deeply rooted cultural myths, the idea has a kernel of truth in it.\n\nIn this episode of IVFML, we go back to our guests from Season One to ask what life is like now that they had children thanks to infertility treatments and whether they are trying to add to their family.\n\nInfertility is a diverse diagnosis, experts say, and whether couples will be able to conceive spontaneously depends on why they were deemed infertile in the first place.\n\nSome people, like Season One guest John Murray, were able to spontaneously conceive a child after infertility treatments. Other guests, like Silvija Ozols or Nam and Aubrey Tran, may hope for a similar outcome but may be more resigned to plunging back into infertility treatments when it comes time to bring more children into the family. Our final guest for the episode, Candace Wohl, knew from the beginning that she would never conceive that \u201csurprise\u201d baby. Wohl had her uterus removed as part of cancer treatment, and thus cannot carry a pregnancy.\n\n\u201cFor many couples, the diagnosis of infertility is more gray,\u201d said Dr. Beth W.

The only example they found was from 1866, before the creation of the Justice Department. Nevertheless, the opinion concluded that Trump\u2019s appointment of Whitaker would be legitimate.\n\n\u201cFollowing Attorney General Sessions\u2019s resignation, the President could have relied upon the Deputy Attorney General, the Solicitor General, or an Assistant Attorney General to serve as Acting Attorney General. But the availability of potential alternatives does not disable Congress from providing the President with discretion to designate other persons,\u201d Engel wrote. \u201cNothing in the text of the Constitution or historical practice suggests that the President may turn to an official who has not been confirmed by the Senate if, but only if, there is no appropriate Senate-confirmed official available.\u201d\n\nOLC, sometimes referred to as the president\u2019s law firm, is a small unit within the Justice Department that plays an important role in the executive branch by offering internal legal reviews before the president or agency takes action. It\u2019s the office that signed off on President Barack Obama\u2019s use of drones against U.S. citizens, and the \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d during the George W. Bush era. Much of OLC\u2019s work is typically shielded from the public, but it does occasionally make its opinions public when it benefits the administration to do so \u2015 such as when there are questions about whether the attorney general has been legitimately appointed.\n\n\n\nA senior Justice Department official declined to say when, precisely, the White House asked OLC to opine on Trump\u2019s options should Sessions resign. The OLC opinion takes the position that it wouldn\u2019t have mattered whether Sessions was fired or resigned.\n\nOLC cited dozens of examples of individuals taking control of top agency positions on an acting basis without being confirmed by the Senate, but could find only one example of an acting attorney general who had not been Senate-confirmed.

I still was in love with Bill at the time so I felt really responsible.\u201d\n\nLewinsky first publicly disclosed that she had considered suicide in an essay she penned for Vanity Fair in June 2014, writing that \u201cthe shame, the scorn, and the fear\u201d put her in a dark place.\n\n\u201cI have never actually attempted suicide, but I had strong suicidal temptations several times during the investigations and during one or two periods after,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThough Lewinsky has said the relationship was consensual, she wrote in March that she was beginning to reconsider that notion based on power imbalances and \u201cthe ability to abuse them.\u201d\n\nIn a new Vanity Fair essay published Tuesday, Lewinsky bashed Clinton for stating earlier this year that he did not feel he owed his former lover a personal apology.\n\n\u201cWhat feels more important to me than whether I am owed or deserving of a personal apology is my belief that Bill Clinton should want to apologize,\u201d Lewinsky wrote. \u201cI\u2019m less disappointed by him, and more disappointed for him.

Those Lee lauded included a longtime collaborator, Jack Kirby.\n\nBack in the 1970s, Evanier was Kirby\u2019s assistant. He saw up close the talents of that legendary artist, a man who some in the comics industry today regard as the true creator behind beloved Marvel characters like The Fantastic Four and The Incredible Hulk. Kirby\u2019s name never became quite as well known as Lee\u2019s, so Evanier was happy to hear Lee giving credit to him, as well as to the others.\n\n\u201cI went to the phone and called [Lee] and thanked him for doing that,\u201d Evanier recalled. \u201cI said I wish he did more of it. He said, \u2018I should do more of that.\u2019 But at times he disappointed me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have so many things to say about [Lee] that it\u2019s going to take me a while to distill them down...,\u201d wrote Evanier. He continued:\n\nHis achievements in the world of comic books were awesome. I happen to think they\u2019re not exactly what a lot of people think but I don\u2019t doubt their size and endurance. I knew him since 1970, worked for him a few times, talked with him at length and fielded an awful lot of phone calls from him asking me questions about comic books he worked on. He really did have a bad memory, if not when he first started telling people he had a bad memory, then certainly later on as he turned more and more into the Stan Lee character he\u2019d created for himself. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to write now.\n\nUnlike the superlative-laden odes to an inarguably treasured icon of pop culture, Evanier\u2019s blog revealed something more: Stan Lee wasn\u2019t a superhero. He was a flawed human being whose legacy is just as complicated as the costumed demigods he helped create.\n\nIn an interview with HuffPost not long after he published the post, Evanier elaborated.\n\n\u201cStan himself, he was a very complicated man,\u201d he said. \u201cOn many levels, there were things to admire about him; there were things you had to overlook to respect him sometimes. I grew up on his work, I got to know him very well, I liked many, many things about him. He participated in a legendary body of work for which I now see obits that vastly over-credited his participation. But I think that\u2019s to be expected at a time when someone like that passes.\u201d\n\nAlbert L. Ortega via Getty Images Comic book covers by Walt Simonson and Jack Kirby.\n\nBut by exaggerating Lee\u2019s status in comic history, Evanier explained, we run the risk of erasing the other voices who helped build the comic world we know today.\n\n\u201cI think that might at best be half right,\u201d he said of the claim that Lee is the \u201csingle greatest contributor\u201d to his field. \u201cThere is this problem of dividing credits when there\u2019s no official standard. He worked with some amazing artists who also were writers, being people who came up with plots and storylines and figured out what would happen in each panel.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can say without fear of contradiction that [Lee] participated in this wonderful body of work, that the Marvel characters are an incredible force of nature that will live forever and just get bigger and bigger every time you look,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can also say without contradiction that his co-creators did not fare as well in terms of credit or remuneration.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the creation of Marvel\u2019s comic book characters was always a collaborative process, Evanier said, with artists contributing to the stories and their arcs, often without proper credit. Lee was always billed as his stories\u2019 first creator, while artists like Kirby or Steve Ditko, who co-created Spider-Man, came in a distant second. They famously resented Lee for it.\n\n\u201cWhen I met [Lee] in 1970, it became very clear to me early on that while he wanted to be rich the way everyone wants to be rich, what he wanted most was to be famous,\u201d Evanier said. \u201cAnd in the last decade or two, I got to see Stan be more famous than he ever dreamed, more a celebrity than he ever imagined, and you never saw anyone be happier at that than Stan.\u201d\n\nEvanier added: \u201cI\u2019m not saying that he didn\u2019t deserve all that, but you tend to think with all that stardom, it\u2019d be nice if some of it had been shown to the other people who were responsible for the storylines and invention of characters. He and I had a few differences at times where I told him to his face that I didn\u2019t feel he had played well with others.\u201d\n\nshould also take the moment of stan lee's passing to note two of the key artists who worked with him to make legendary art - jack kirby and steve ditko pic.twitter.com/bqyJoYPc5S \u2014 Oliver Willis (@owillis) November 12, 2018\n\nThroughout our conversation, Evanier spoke specifically of Kirby. Though beloved by comics industry fanatics and fanboys, Kirby failed to receive the recognition, notoriety or compensation he was looking for before his death in 1994.\n\n\u201cJack came out of a time when the most important thing a man did was provide for his family and he was frustrated when he was denied the ability to do that,\u201d Evanier recalled. \u201cStan was younger than Jack but essentially of the same era... It\u2019s just sometimes people have trouble separating what was done, and they shouldn\u2019t because these were co-creations, and they weren\u2019t necessarily co-creations where Stan wrote everything and Jack drew everything. Jack did draw everything, but Jack was a fountain of ideas and concepts and storylines and plots.\u201d\n\nThe label \u201cco-creator\u201d shouldn\u2019t downplay the immense role Lee played in igniting an entire fandom community. Todd McFarlane, the co-creator of Venom, told HuffPost he admired Lee as a kid before later going on to work at Marvel. In his opinion, Lee didn\u2019t take credit where it wasn\u2019t due. Rather than say things like \u201cI created,\u201d McFarlane said Lee would use the word \u201cwe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think, unfortunately, part of the thing that gets put into this mix is he lived to be 95 and some of his co-creators didn\u2019t,\u201d McFarlane said. \u201cSo we have a tendency as a society to naturally just go to the person in front of us. When there were Stan and Jack Kirby, we talked about the both of them. But once Jack left us the only person left now is Stan.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t trying to steal [credit] away,\u201d McFarlane added. \u201cIt just got put on him. People were misusing the word. I was around a lot of people that would say \u2018the creator,\u2019 and I probably slipped up. [I\u2019d say] \u2018the creator of Iron Man,\u2019 and he would correct me and go, \u2018No, I created it with so and so.\u2019\u201d\n\nToday, Kirby is getting more acknowledgment. Following a lawsuit against Marvel by Kirby\u2019s family, which was settled in 2014, the artist now receives co-creator credit on various Marvel characters. That development, Evanier said, is a positive one.\n\nAlthough he doesn\u2019t let Lee completely off the hook for how Kirby and the other artists were treated, Evanier still at times counts himself among Lee\u2019s fans. He\u2019s glad the departed comic book legend \u2015 who worked a series of menial jobs in the comic industry before catapulting to fame \u2015 will be remembered for his contributions to Marvel\u2019s eventual global success.\n\n\u201cYou also have got these guys who created these comics who came out of the Depression who tried very hard to make livings at that time, who were working in an industry that was not prepared for this level of success,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who owned and ran Marvel in its early days sold it for what now looks like the sale of Manhattan for junk jewelry. The creators did not get rewarded because the people who owned the building had no idea what the material was worth. We still don\u2019t because every time we think it\u2019s reached its maximum, it grows bigger on us. I\u2019m very pleased that Stan got to ride some success on that.\u201d", "There\u2019s no telling whether stars will be born on \u201cWestside,\u201d Netflix\u2019s experimental new docuseries that pulls back the curtain on nine artists hoping to hit it big in the Los Angeles music scene.\n\nThe eight-episode show, which debuted Nov. 9, is a fascinating (and fascinatingly messy) mashup of behind-the-scenes testimonies with rehearsal footage that feels a bit like \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d meets \u201cThe Real World.\u201d It begins as three of the musicians \u2015 Caitlin Ary, James Byous and Sean Patrick Murray, who is the show\u2019s co-creator and a supervising producer \u2015 unveil plans to stage a live musical show called \u201cNaked\u201d at a popular L.A. nightspot.\n\nThe trio assembles a diverse lineup featuring themselves along with Arika Gluck, Austin Kolbe, Leo Gallo, Alexandra Krekorian, Pia Toscano and Taz Zavala.

Once the remaining performers had been assembled, Murray began documenting the rehearsal process, and eventually approached Netflix executives, who he said \u201cloved\u201d the idea of a stylized yet off-the-cuff series with original music. (Check out Murray\u2019s song, \u201cAll I Wanna Be,\u201d in the video below.)\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so beautiful about unscripted television is that you don\u2019t need to make things happen. Life itself is very interesting if you let it happen naturally,\u201d Murray told HuffPost. \u201cI think every single person really made a pact with themselves that they would be their most truthful self.\u201d\n\nFor each of the show\u2019s nine subjects, nothing was off-limits, Murray said. One of his most personal milestones is included in the show\u2019s third episode, when he marries his husband, Andy Hotchkiss. He and Hotchkiss, who is not a performer, discussed whether to permit the \u201cWestside\u201d cameras to document their wedding for the show last year. Ultimately, they decided to give the team the go-ahead.\n\n\u201cI know people whose parents still don\u2019t accept them,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m finding through this process that I have a responsibility to become the role model I never knew that I needed to be. Something that I take very seriously now is that with this platform [and] if someone could see this wedding and see all the love that was there on that night... maybe I might help someone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWestside\u201d marks the latest chapter in Murray\u2019s varied performing career, which began when he booked a Hamburger Helper commercial at age 8. The New Jersey native studied acting at New York University before relocating to Los Angeles, and these days, he\u2019s focused less on Hollywood stardom and more on simply \u201ccreating work I love and can stand behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only way the show would be a success is if we allowed ourselves to be the most authentic,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAs soon as we thought about the message that [having our wedding on the show] was going to send, it became about sharing love, acceptance and support.\u201d\n\nGreg Gayne/Netflix \u201cI have a responsibility to become the role model I never knew that I needed to be,\" co-creator Sean Patrick Murray said.\n\nWhether Murray and his \u201cWestside\u201d cast mates get the artistic recognition they crave from the show remains to be seen. (Early reviews of the series have been mixed.) Still, he\u2019s hopeful the show will be renewed for additional seasons and ultimately serve as a platform that \u201ccreates more opportunities for them to be their most authentic selves.\u201d", "Photo Courtesy of Stephanie Drenka For many adoptees, the life story they are told begins with their adoption, but their arrival is only part of a longer narrative.\n\nEveryone asks me \u2015 an adoptee \u2015 what I\u2019m doing to celebrate National Adoption Awareness Month. As if I should rejoice each November because I\u2019m so \u201clucky\u201d to have been adopted.\n\nBut to me, this month feels like being at a wild party and losing something in the crowd. You try calling for help \u2015 asking others to join in your search \u2015 but the music and festivities drown out your voice. Your interruption is not only unwanted; it is unacknowledged. This party is not for you.\n\nThe name itself irks me. National Adoption Awareness Month. I don\u2019t believe our country is generally unaware of adoption. The practice has been happening everywhere in various forms since ancient times. America\u2019s first modern adoption law dates back to the 19th century. Today people seem well versed in the popular \u201crescuer and rescued\u201d adoption narrative. We don\u2019t need a month, week or day to celebrate this.\n\nNancy Verrier wrote in her book The Primal Wound: Understanding the Adopted Child, \u201cWhen the adoptee is separated from her birth mother, she undergoes extensive trauma. She will not remember this trauma, but it will stay in her subconscious as she lived it.\u201d\n\nSome would consider me fortunate because I\u2019ve been able to cope with my trauma. I went to therapy for the first time at the age of 32. My counselor expressed her surprise that I was so quickly able to name the root of my issues. The desperation to please people, inability to say no, fear of abandonment, low self-esteem, susceptibility to abusive relationships \u2014 it all traces back to this thing that we\u2019re supposed to celebrate.\n\nNational Adoption Awareness Month minimizes individual experiences of adoptees and masks the deeper systemic problems that keep the practice in existence. The month remains dominated by happy stories of adoptive parents and their \u201cforever families.\u201d Adoptees who deviate from the narrative are deemed angry or bitter, traitors to the narrative of adoptees as \u201dthe lucky ones.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, I\u2019ve lived the fairy-tale adoption story. At 3 months old, I was one of the youngest adoptees to arrive from South Korea to the United States. My entire extended family waited at the airport to welcome me lovingly. I\u2019ve felt that blanket of love every day since May 21, 1986.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Stephanie Drenka Stephanie Drenka was adopted at the age of 3 months old from Eastern Social Welfare Society in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nI returned to South Korea in 2008 for a Future Leaders\u2019 Conference sponsored by the Overseas Koreans Foundation. During a visit to my adoption agency, I learned that I had two elder biological sisters who may or may not have known about me. That day, I decided to begin a long and emotionally taxing birth family search.\n\nThe adoption agency sent telegrams to my birth mother\u2019s home address for years. I went on a South Korean television show in the hope of reaching someone who might have a clue to my past.\n\nIn September 2013, I received an email from my social worker in South Korea. Although it was against the rules for her to reach out to my biological sisters, she had sent a telegraph to one of them. My sister responded. The family (including my younger brother, who I didn\u2019t know existed) had been searching too. They wanted to meet me as soon as possible. I flew to South Korea and reunited with them over Thanksgiving week.\n\nIt was during this trip that I understood fully: Adoption is loss. Not only the loss I experienced as an adoptee but also what my birth family endured.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Stephanie Drenka Drenka was reunited as an adult with her birth mother in South Korea, who expressed both gratitude that her daughter lived a happy life after adoption and shame from her decision.\n\nMy social worker had advised me to take childhood photos to share with them. I did her one better and played a video montage my mom made for my college graduation. As they watched my younger self dance across the screen in old high school show choir clips, the reactions weren\u2019t what I expected. One of my sisters started crying and left the room. Naively, I thought the video would bring them some sort of joy or comfort. In reality, I was forcing them to face the inescapable proof of a life they missed.\n\nAfterward, they shared the painful story of my adoption. It turns out that my fairy-tale ending wasn\u2019t so happily ever after: My birth father, who died in 2004, was abusive. He already had two daughters and wanted a son. After learning my gender, he coerced my birth mother into relinquishing me for adoption.\n\nShe wrote in a letter to me, \u201cAfter you were born and I was alone holding you, in that short time, I wanted to hold you until I died. It\u2019s a feeling I still can\u2019t forget today.\u201d\n\nI left South Korea with more questions than I arrived. With language and transportation barriers, there will never be enough time together to make up for lost years.\n\nBeing adopted means a lifetime of either searching or denial. Following trails of breadcrumbs, trying to find clues to your existence without losing yourself. It is an ever-present reminder that you belong nowhere. Sometimes the burden becomes too much to bear.\n\nA study conducted at the University of Minnesota from 1998 to 2008 found adopted offspring to be nearly four times as likely to attempt suicide as non-adopted offspring. Even with a relatively positive adoption story, I\u2019ve battled with depression \u2014 in silence, because I felt society\u2019s pressure to be grateful for my adoption. Though I never slit my wrists, there are scars on my ankle from self-mutilation as a teenager. Years of bullying and microaggressions marked my body and heart. I kept the cuts hidden under clothing, masking my pain with a smile I wore onstage in show choir and theater.\n\nMy high school in Southlake, Texas, recently made the news after a video of white students chanting the N-word went viral. This seemed shocking to some but came as no surprise to me. In my class of more than 500 students, I could count on my hands those who were people of color. During a diversity week at school, a classmate asked what I would do if he called me a Chink. He proceeded to repeat, \u201cChink, Chink, Chink,\u201d until he tired of my unresponsiveness. Though I wouldn\u2019t let my anger rise to his ignorance, internalized racism haunted me for years.\n\nI\u2019ve encountered many adoptive parents who insist they don\u2019t see their transracially adopted child as different from them. This false concept of colorblindness denies the existence of racism in America and their children\u2019s racial identity. Some even claim their children have never experienced bias or encounters with racist people. It is more likely that they have but are afraid or don\u2019t know how to discuss it. To speak truth is to be ungrateful.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Stephanie Drenka Drenka maintains contact with her biological siblings post-reunion, but language and geographic barriers limit their relationship.\n\nPlease do not mistake my tone as anti-adoption. I\u2019ve visited the Eastern Social Welfare Society\u2019s home for babies in Seoul. I stood helplessly on the other side of the glass staring into a room filled with days-old infants wailing without comfort. I didn\u2019t have the proper vaccinations to hold and soothe them and quiet their cries. I would never want them to live without a sense of belonging or family. But I do know: This is only the beginning of their struggle.\n\nMy call to action is not for the end of adoption. It is for a deeper understanding of its complexities, even the not-so-pleasant parts. There needs to be a centering of adoptee voices and value placed on their experiences. We must acknowledge their loss and develop trauma-informed support systems for them.\n\nIf you must do something to commemorate National Adoption Awareness Month, please honor the words of adoptees. We build our stories on top of foundations filled with cracks and voids. No matter how many resources we\u2019re given to construct our identity, we are in a constant state of imbalance.\n\nThe fact that I am a thriving, happy and healthy adult adoptee is not luck; it is resilience.", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is weighing an administration-wide shakeup as he looks to prepare his White House for divided government, but it is unclear who is going and who is staying.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was thought to be out as soon as this week, according to two people with knowledge of the issue, but she is now likely to remain in the post for a longer period because there is no obvious successor in place.\n\nTrump has soured on Nielsen and White House chief of staff John Kelly, in part over frustration that his administration is not doing more to address what he has called a crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the people. But the scope of the contemplated changes is far broader, as Trump gears up for a wave of Democratic oversight requests and to devote more effort to his own re-election campaign.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the situation, Trump is also discussing replacing Kelly with Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Nick Ayers. Kelly, a retired Marine general, has been credited with bringing order and process to a chaotic West Wing, but he has fallen out of favor with the president as well as presidential daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nAyers, a seasoned campaign operative, would restore a political-mindset to the role, but he faces stiff opposition from some corners of the West Wing, with some aides lobbying Trump directly against the move.\n\nOther changes are afoot, as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke are being discussed for replacement. And in an extraordinary move Tuesday, first lady Melania Trump\u2019s office called publicly for the firing of Trump\u2019s deputy national security adviser, Mira Ricardel.\n\nFor all of the talk of churn, Trump often expresses frustration with aides and then does not take action. Talk of Kelly\u2019s exit has percolated for months and he remains in place.\n\nNielsen had hoped to complete one year in the job and leave in December, but it appeared unlikely she would last that long, said two sources. Both people who had knowledge of the debate spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nCurbing illegal immigration is Trump\u2019s signature issue \u2014 and one he returns to as a way to rally his most loyal supporters.\n\nBut anyone who takes over at Homeland Security is likely to run up against the same problems that Nielsen faced. The administration has already tried to clamp down at the border but those efforts have been largely thwarted or watered down due to legal challenges.\n\nTrump also told allies that he never fully trusted Nielsen, whom he associated with President George W. Bush, a longtime foe. And he told those close to him that he felt, at times, that her loyalty was more toward her longtime mentor \u2014 Kelly \u2014 than to the president.\n\nZinke, who faces several ethics investigations, said in interview with The Associated Press on Monday that he has spoken in recent days with Trump, Pence and Kelly about probes into his leadership and they remain supportive. He denied any wrongdoing.\n\nRoss addressed turnover rumors at a Yahoo! Finance summit Tuesday, saying he was in the post to give back to the country and support Trump.\n\n\u201cI worked very hard to get President Trump elected,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019d like to work equally hard to have him succeed and be re-elected.\u201d\n\nQuestions about Nielsen\u2019s job security are not new. Earlier this year, she pushed back on a New York Times report that she drafted a resignation letter but did not submit it, after Trump scolded her at a Cabinet meeting.\n\nNielsen has led the sprawling post-9/11 federal agency since December. She had been chief of staff to Kelly when he was Trump\u2019s first Homeland Security secretary. A DHS spokesman would not comment on whether she was leaving.\n\n\u201cThe secretary is honored to lead the men and women of DHS and is committed to implementing the president\u2019s security-focused agenda to protect Americans from all threats and will continue to do so,\u201d spokesman Tyler Houlton said.\n\nNielsen advocated for strong cybersecurity defense, and often said she believed the next terror major attack would occur online \u2014 not by planes or bombs. She was tasked with helping states secure elections following interference by Russians during the 2016 election.\n\nShe pushed Trump\u2019s immigration policies, including funding for his border wall and defended the administration\u2019s practice of separating children from parents, telling a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens \u201cin the United States every day.\u201d But she was also instrumental in stopping the separations.\n\nJust last week, the administration announced that migrants would be denied asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border if they crossed illegally, creating regulations that circumvent immigration laws stating anyone can claim asylum no matter how they arrive to the country. The decision would affect about 70,000 people annually and was immediately challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nNielsen also moved to abandon longstanding regulations that dictate how long children are allowed to be held in immigration detention, and requested bed space from the U.S. military for some 12,000 people in an effort to detain all families who cross the border. Right now there is space for about 3,000 families and they are at capacity.\n\nShe got into heated discussions with Trump and White House aides several times over immigration policy, as she sought to explain the complicated legal challenges behind immigration law and pushed for a more diplomatic approach.", "Fox News host Laura Ingraham dedicated a segment of her show Tuesday to criticizing four progressive Democrats who won election to Congress in last week\u2019s midterms.\n\nIn a 10-minute segment titled \u201cThe Freshman Insurrection,\u201d the \u201cIngraham Angle\u201d host predicted that \u201cdark, pink clouds\u201d were gathering on the horizon with the arrival of Congresswomen-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (the youngest woman ever elected to Congress), Ayanna Pressley (Massachusetts\u2019 first black congresswoman), Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar (the first Muslim women elected to Congress).\n\nIngraham, who ahead of the midterms repeatedly urged her audience to vote Republican or face an invasion of immigrants, dubbed the quartet \u201cthe four horsewomen of the apocalypse\u201d and expressed doubt about their ability to work with other Democrats.\n\nShe further accused the \u201cprogressive upstarts\u201d of holding \u201cthe most radical views in Congress\u201d \u2014 such as advocating for free college and health care for all \u2015 and mocked them for posing for this \u201csquad\u201d photograph:\n\nCheck out the clip here:", "Warning: This post contains some spoilers about \u201cFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.\u201d\n\nHOGWARTS, LOS ANGELES \u2015 If you ask actress Claudia Kim about the evolution of her \u201cFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\u201d character, Nagini, she\u2019ll answer the question as if she were any other \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fan.\n\n\u201cI am so curious how she gets there,\u201d Kim mused during a panel Q&A at Universal Studios Hollywood.\n\nIn this case, \u201cthere\u201d refers to the moment when Nagini transforms permanently from a woman into a snake \u2015 or more accurately, one of Voldemort\u2019s living, breathing Horcruxes. When a moderator pried for more details about Kim\u2019s role in the J.K. Rowling franchise, she had only this to say: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nUntil about two months ago, with the \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\u201d sequel due to hit theaters a week before Thanksgiving, Kim\u2019s role in the movie was almost entirely obscured. Her character was originally listed as \u201cMaledictus,\u201d which, according to the fan site Pottermore, is \u201ca witch who carries a \u2018blood curse\u2019 that \u2018destines her ultimately to transform into a beast.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut in September, a trailer confirmed her fate (and a popular fan theory): Kim\u2019s Maledictus would be Nagini, who before falling prey to Voldemort\u2019s reign was a young female circus performer with the ability to temporarily morph into a snake.\n\nIt\u2019s at the circus where Nagini befriends one of the central characters from the first \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d installment, Credence (Ezra Miller), who\u2019s struggling to define himself after an adolescence spent under the purview of a magic-hating foster mom in New York, where his wizarding abilities spiraled out of control.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Magic \u2015 plus protagonist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and American auror Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) \u2015 are hoping to track down Credence before Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) does. The evil wizard believes that Credence, who was able to survive the Obscurus parasite that formed inside him when his foster mother forced him to repress his magic, will help Grindelwald execute his dreams of wizard-muggle domination.\n\n\u201cThe path has been laid,\u201d Grindelwald says. \u201cAnd he\u2019s following it. The trail that will lead him to me.\u201d\n\nKim mostly serves as a sympathetic companion to Credence in \u201dThe Crimes of Grindelwald.\u201d The film doesn\u2019t provide many clues about her eventual transformation into a snake, nor does it explain how she ends up turning to the dark side in the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d series.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t yet have a wand, a fact she lamented during the panel. But unlike lovable, goofy Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) \u2015 a no-maj, the American term for \u201cmuggle\u201d \u2015 Kim told Entertainment Weekly in a recent interview, Nagini does have \u201cpowers that are yet to be explored.\u201d\n\nNagini\u2019s future is canonical, but just how she gets there \u2015 that\u2019s the stuff of intrigue. It\u2019s the kind of breadcrumb-laden story that will likely reel viewers into theaters for the third, fourth and fifth installments of \u201cFantastic Beasts,\u201d no matter how lackluster the sequels prove to be.\n\nA special Q&A with the cast in front of Hogwarts after fans experienced #FantasticBeasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald for the first time! #ProtectTheSecrets | \ud83d\udcf7: @LeStudioPhotos pic.twitter.com/FiHBp06Mj2 \u2014 Fantastic Beasts (@FantasticBeasts) November 4, 2018\n\nLike most Pottheads, Kim, now 33, read all of Rowling\u2019s books when they came out. She said she thinks it\u2019s \u201cso cool\u201d that her character isn\u2019t confined to the \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d storylines and also appears in the \u201ciconic \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 films.\u201d\n\n\u201cKorean translations weren\u2019t available, so I had someone send books from the U.S. to me,\u201d she said during the panel, which was held in front of the Hogwarts replica at Wizarding World after a fan screening last week in Los Angeles.\n\nWhile she\u2019s new to Rowling\u2019s universe, the actress has been part of other popular franchises. She played Dr. Helen Cho in Marvel\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Age of Ultron,\u201d and last year she starred alongside Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in \u201cThe Dark Tower,\u201d based on Stephen King\u2019s popular books.\n\nWhen Warner Bros. announced Nagini\u2019s involvement in \u201cThe Crimes of Grindelwald,\u201d Rowling admitted to her Twitter followers that she had been sitting on the character\u2019s origin story for \u201caround twenty years.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of revelation that Harry Potter fans live for; a primary player\u2019s biography \u2015 two decades in the making! \u2015 is finally escaping the depths of Pottermore for the silver screen. Rowling was probably not prepared for the wave of criticism that followed.\n\nAfter the trailer revealed that a South Korean actress would be playing a woman destined to become the pet snake of a white male villain, a group of fans on social media criticized Rowling for the casting choice. Some \u2015 like author Ellen Oh \u2015 argued that by picking an Asian woman for the role, the movie was perpetuating long-standing racist tropes.\n\nI feel like this is the problem when white people want to diversify and don't actually ask POC how to do so. They don't make the connection between making Nagini an Asian woman who later on is the pet of a white man. So I'm going to say it right now. That shit is racist. \u2014 Ellen \"VOTE LIKE OUR LIVES DEPENDS ON IT\" Oh (@ElloEllenOh) September 25, 2018\n\nOh said she believes the casting controversy blew up in part because \u201cof what is a clear, stark division within the fandom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who will not hear one single bad word against their fave and those who recognize that she is human and as problematic as any of us can be if we don\u2019t learn from our mistakes,\u201d Oh told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cWe have to consider the type of representation we are getting,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m of the mindset that no representation is better than bad representation because bad representation has far-reaching negative ramifications. But I know that there are some who believe bad representation is better than none.\u201d\n\nRowling has faced criticism, namely for the lack of people of color cast in the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d franchise. In 2015 one YouTube user \u2015 Dylan Marron \u2015 compiled a video titled \u201cEvery Single Word Spoken by a Person of Color in the Entire \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 Film Series.\u201d It\u2019s just over six minutes long. There are eight films in the series.\n\nOh noted that Rowling \u201cnever addressed the hurt she gave the Native American community for the cultural appropriation she committed when she published the history of the magical community in North America.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like it was an opportunity for her to listen and learn, but instead, she doubled down and continued to expand the \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 universe without thinking about the ramifications to her IPOC [indigenous people of color] fans,\u201d Oh said.\n\nRowling disagrees with her critics regarding the casting for Nagini. In response to the backlash, she tweeted, \u201cThe Naga are snake-like mythical creatures of Indonesian mythology, hence the name \u2018Nagini.\u2019 They are sometimes depicted as winged, sometimes as half-human, half-snake. Indonesia comprises a few hundred ethnic groups, including Javanese, Chinese and Betawi.\u201d\n\nThe Naga are snake-like mythical creatures of Indonesian mythology, hence the name \u2018Nagini.\u2019 They are sometimes depicted as winged, sometimes as half-human, half-snake.

Rowling (@jk_rowling) September 26, 2018\n\nKim didn\u2019t address the negative responses during the panel. But in an interview in Seoul, South Korea, last month, she described the criticism from fans as \u201cunexpected.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I found out that I\u2019m playing Nagini, I thought it was meaningful because it\u2019s an important character in the \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 series,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018Harry Potter\u2019 is a franchise film with many Caucasian actors, so I thought many Korean viewers would be happy.\u201d\n\nShe added that she is \u201clooking forward to viewers being satisfied and the controversy fading away once the film premieres.\u201d\n\nHowever, if the controversy surrounding Kim\u2019s casting fades, it may give way only to discussions of the various other parts of the film that fall short. Namely, the gaping holes in the Wizarding World\u2019s timeline and the cumbersome twist at the end of the movie. (We won\u2019t give it away.)\n\nThere are parts that work. It takes a while to warm up to the fact that Jude Law is young Dumbledore, but the handsome actor nailed his entry into the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d franchise. (During the panel at Hogwarts, he said that he was on vacation with his family when he heard he landed the role and that he started carrying around a twig as wand practice.) Depp, perhaps in part due to the controversy surrounding his own casting, is easy to despise as Grindelwald.\n\nMost notably, Kim does a solid job as a fellow newcomer to the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d world. Despite the meager amount of dialogue for her, she dazzles as a woman struggling to contain her inner beast. Her transformation from human into reptile is truly a wonder to watch on screen, thanks in part to the visual effects team and her work with a contortionist.\n\nKim told audiences in Los Angeles that the more she learned about Nagini\u2019s backstory, the more she sympathized with the character, adding, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that Nagini is absolutely terrifying.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d franchise might not yet have realized the same complexities that Kim has, but it has at least three more movies to figure it out.", "President Donald Trump has nominated retired Army Gen. John Abizaid to fill the long-vacant job of U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia amid tensions over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThe four-star general, now a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution think tank and a private consultant, headed the U.S. Central Command from 2003 until 2007, overseeing the Iraq war and military operations across the Middle East.\n\nSaudi Arabia is a key U.S. economic, diplomatic and strategic partner in the Middle East, though relations have been strained since the killing of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of the kingdom. After denying responsibility, the Saudis admitted Khashoggi was slain in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul at the hands of Saudi personnel.\n\nThe Saudi ambassador post, which requires Senate confirmation, has been vacant since Trump became president. Trump\u2019s selection of a military figure may reflect the kingdom\u2019s importance as a customer of U.S. weaponry.

Pregnant and living in her vehicle with her four kids in the fall of 2013, Rebecca Fritz began a desperate, strategic search for a place to crash before winter hit.\n\nFritz, who had previously been living in a suburban domestic violence shelter, had called around to shelters, but they always seemed to be full. So she drove around looking for vacant, unsecured houses that hadn\u2019t yet been ransacked by scrappers. Then she\u2019d sneak in at night to inspect. Next came a look at property details on Zillow, using the Wi-Fi at McDonald\u2019s, and finally a county records check for delinquent taxes \u2015 meaning, Fritz determined, that the owner had likely given up on the property and her family would be less at risk of being discovered.\n\nFritz considered about a dozen houses before choosing a modest 1920s five-bedroom house on the city\u2019s west side. She changed the locks, blacked out the windows and quietly moved in. The most attractive feature of the home, which had no heat, was the fireplace \u2015 those first few months, Fritz and her kids spent nights curled up in blankets in front of the fire they fed with wood hauled from nearby alleys. When it was really cold, they\u2019d go to her dad\u2019s, a longtime squatter in an abandoned house heated by a wood-burning stove.\n\nFritz rigged a makeshift shower using a kiddie pool and found an oversized sink in the garbage that she could use for cooking and washing clothes. She installed a circuit box and ran wiring to the first floor so they could run electric heaters, learning as she went.\n\nEven without having to pay rent, Fritz has struggled to afford necessities. She takes housecleaning gigs, but can\u2019t reliably get to the suburbs, where jobs are more plentiful, without a car. She also juggles work with taking care of her kids and rehabbing the house.\n\nHer difficulty finding stable employment and housing led her to activism. She\u2019s protested the city\u2019s foreclosure epidemic and water department\u2019s shut-off policy for low-income residents \u2015 which brought United Nations scrutiny \u2015 through grassroots groups like Detroit Eviction Defense.\n\n\u201cAt eight months pregnant, I was scrubbing floors. A few of my friends, once they realized I was serious about what I was doing, they helped me get a dumpster to get the garbage out,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cI knew as an activist that sometimes when we push from the bottom, especially in emergency situations, things like this can be possible.\u201d\n\nSquatting To Survive\n\nTraditionally ignored by the city and often tolerated by neighbors, squatters occupy more than 3,000 homes in Detroit, according to the Detroit Land Bank Authority, a public agency that manages the city\u2019s abandoned properties. Squatters frequently go without running water or heat in neighborhoods that have seen little of the investment animating the city\u2019s downtown core.\n\nDetroit has a tangle of different conditions that make squatting a possibility, said sociologist Claire Herbert: The city has more than 43,000 vacant homes, according to research group Data Driven Detroit, and 1 in 3 families is living in poverty \u2015 plus there\u2019s a lack of city resources for both property regulation and housing assistance.\n\nAn assistant professor at Drexel University, Herbert lived in Detroit for five years researching illegal property use. She recently published two papers on squatting. She focused on survival squatters (people who take refuge in abandoned homes for emergency shelter) and holdover squatters (renters or former owners who stay after foreclosure). In Detroit, squatting is one form of precarious housing on a spectrum that includes street sleeping or doubling up in an apartment, said Herbert.\n\nSean Proctor for HuffPost Fritz and her 4-year-old daughter, Honesty, remove Halloween decorations from their front porch and lawn on Nov. 12.\n\n\u201cThere are some squatters who in a sense \u2018choose\u2019 squatting because it allows them to buy their kids food,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cA lot of them have jobs, but they\u2019re still so poor they can\u2019t afford rent and to live.\u201d\n\nShelter facilities haven\u2019t kept up with the changing demographics of the homeless population, said Tasha Gray, executive director of the Housing Action Network of Detroit, which coordinates the different shelter agencies in the city. They tend to have openings for single men but not enough beds for women and families.\n\n\u201cI know that we\u2019re turning people away,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMaybe [squatting] is not the greatest resource but it\u2019s better for them than nothing at all \u2026 but because [squatters] are not always coming into the system, it\u2019s hard for us to make a case about the need for additional resources.\u201d\n\nKeeping Blight At Bay\n\nThe city has lost two-thirds of its population since its 1950s peak, and despite a frantic rate of demolitions in recent years, the housing stock hasn\u2019t declined at similar rates.\n\nSo when one house on a block goes vacant, blight can spread to neighboring structures like a cancer. Residents sometimes try to contain vacancies on their blocks by adopting empty houses, urban planning professor Kimberley Kinder details in her book DIY Detroit: Making Do in a City Without Services. This can be anything from hanging holiday decorations, moving the trash cans weekly or painting fake interior scenes on windows they boarded up themselves.\n\nSean Proctor for HuffPost Mark Covington catches a chicken at the Georgia Street Community Collective on Nov. 12. In 2008, Covington started tending three vacant lots, turning them into a community garden to prevent illegal dumping.\n\nSome residents go a step further and use vacant property to create a community resource. Back in 2008, Mark Covington was tending to three vacant lots on his block when he decided to plant a community garden to stop people from illegally dumping their trash. Kids started showing up to help out, and 10 years later three lots have turned into 23, with hundreds participating in different programs at Covington\u2019s nonprofit, Georgia Street Community Collective. The community garden has turned into a full-fledged urban farm, with a few dozen kinds of vegetables, fruit trees, goats, chickens and a bee colony.\n\nSquatting can be another way to breathe life into abandoned homes. Of course, squatters are not always welcome. In some neighborhoods, legal residents are trying to keep them out. They have expressed anger at squatters trashing houses and selling drugs or bringing other criminal activity to their doorstep, including violence. But according to Herbert, those cases don\u2019t match many squatter-neighbor relationships.\n\nI wanted people to know I\u2019m not just a squatter. I\u2019m trying to make this a home. Rebecca Fritz\n\nThe city\u2019s vacancy and rampant speculation invert the normal assumption that ownership is the pinnacle of neighborhood care. In the absence of city enforcement, Detroiters use their own gauge to informally regulate illegal property use \u2015 what Herbert calls an \u201cethos of care\u201d \u2015 so if squatters contribute to the community, neighbors are more likely to welcome them.\n\nSome officials Herbert interviewed for her research encouraged responsible squatting. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have squatters, might as well be good ones,\u201d one police officer told her. Another cop confronted squatters on his block; instead of telling them to leave, he made them mow their lawn.\n\nWhen Fritz moved into a mostly occupied block where neighbors keep an eye on each other, she first focused on making the interior livable. But as soon as the cold weather broke, she started planting flowers and trimming bushes.\n\n\u201cI wanted people to know I\u2019m not just a squatter,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to make this a home.\u201d\n\nIn exchange, Fritz said, her presence on the corner makes it safer for the kids who walk to school through her alley.\n\nFrom Squatter To Homeowner\n\nFrom age 17 to 34, Fritz was homeless more than a dozen times, crashing in the woods, a storage facility and an apartment building basement.\n\n\u201cMy kids up to that point hadn\u2019t had any stability. This is the only home that Honesty\u2019s ever known,\u201d Fritz said of her 4-year-old daughter.\n\nBut squatting is still fraught with insecurity. Children\u2019s Protective Services caseworkers kept showing up. The owner tried to evict her. Eventually, the house was tax-foreclosed in 2015 and it became the property of the Detroit Land Bank Authority, leaving Fritz holding her breath again.\n\nSean Proctor for HuffPost Honesty watches an episode of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" on Fritz's phone. In August, Fritz finally received the deed to the house she was squatting in with her family due to a Detroit Land Bank Authority program called BuyBack.\n\nThrough her activism connections, Fritz got wind of the Land Bank\u2019s experiment to sell homes to squatters. The BuyBack program started with a pilot in 2015, aimed at squatters who had previously been legal tenants or owners of their homes, had family connections to property, or had been paying utilities or fixing their homes. After paying $1,000 upfront, participants attend homeowner education workshops and must pay property taxes for a year.\n\nFritz had the receipts and pictures to prove she\u2019d been rehabbing her house. She scraped together about $400 and crowdfunded the rest to enter the program in March 2017. This August, nearly five years after she moved in, she got the deed to her home.\n\nA Hollowed-Out City\n\nOfficials have slowly begun to implement systemic changes to stem rampant foreclosure, as increasing evidence emerges to back up what activists have been saying all along: Under state law, many foreclosed owners should have had lower taxes or could have been exempted from paying them altogether.\n\nSean Proctor for HuffPost At left, a house owned by the Detroit Land Bank Authority and, at right, a vacant house owned by Covington and the Georgia Street Community Collective. The Land Bank required Covington to board up the house or possibly lose ownership, though the Land Bank has yet to board up this and other houses on the same block.\n\nStarting in 2014, the city began transferring vacant tax-foreclosed properties to the Land Bank in bulk to better manage abandoned buildings. Now the agency controls more than 60,000 vacant lots and 30,000 homes, according to Dispositions Director Reginald Scott II. It also unwittingly became a major landlord with a hands-off approach that\u2019s angered some neighbors who live by Land Bank squatters and decaying homes. Others complain that the Land Bank is holding onto properties and only offers a small fraction to buyers.\n\n\u201cWe do not have the resources to secure every one of our properties. It would just be virtually impossible,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWe are the true owner of last resort.\u201d\n\nGeorgia Street gardener Mark Covington said the sales process has improved from the days when he\u2019d try to buy vacant lots and get shuttled from one clueless city office to another. Last year, GSCC was finally able to buy from the Land Bank six of the lots the group had worked for nine years, and it is authorized to buy another nine once it\u2019s raised the necessary funds.\n\nCovington said it was a relief to start taking ownership, easing fears that a developer might swoop in to capitalize on or destroy what he and his neighbors have built. \u201cI think it\u2019s more important that individuals and small, grassroots organizations do [community development] because they\u2019re on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir hands are in the dirt. They know what\u2019s happening in the neighborhood.\u201d\n\nA Precarious Future\n\nScott works to shrink the Land Bank\u2019s inventory with a variety of programs, including BuyBack. It has identified 800 occupants so far who qualified to start the squat-to-own program, and 360 individuals have signed deeds. Only four dropped out before finishing.\n\nSean Proctor for HuffPost Houses owned by the Detroit Land Bank remain not boarded up along the same street as Covington and the Georgia Street Community Collective.\n\nThe Land Bank has identified about another 1,400 squatters who don\u2019t meet the program qualifications. It\u2019s unclear what will happen to squatters who stay. Scott stressed the agency\u2019s \u201cpeople-first approach\u201d and said it is also working with nonprofits to rehab and rent properties to current occupants. That initiative has struggled, with an early partner evicting squatters improperly and selling some of the homes purchased from the Land Bank at a profit.\n\nThe program\u2019s strategy for addressing housing insecurity is progressive in some ways, Herbert said, though she questioned whether it could be a true long-term solution without efforts to address broader economic issues for low-income families, for whom homeownership can be a major financial burden. She suggested the program would ideally require less money upfront and give occupants longer to become financially independent, while offering assistance with repairs and employment search \u2015 similar to the \u201chousing first\u201d model. In Fritz\u2019s case, ownership is not a panacea, and her water was shut off recently after she was unable to pay her bill.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t see squatting going away in the near future but is concerned that as revitalization continues and the housing market strengthens, the city may crack down on squatters without providing alternatives \u2015 like the water department changing its policy to require a deed or lease agreement to get water turned on.\n\nSean Proctor for HuffPost Fritz builds a fire using wood collected from the alley to heat her house.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something really messed up happening in the city right now ... which is the increasing criminalization of squatting and demonizing those who do,\u201d said Michele Oberholtzer, who helps tenants buy those diverted auction homes through her work with the United Community Housing Coalition.\n\n\u201cWe have homes without people and people without homes. It does not make sense, and we have to find a way to put the two together,\u201d she said.\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page.\n\nHuffPost\u2019s \u201cThis New World\u201d series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

For every well-wisher who knocks it out of the park with a warm, big-hearted spiel about the couple, there\u2019s a groomsman or old friend who goes hard on the open bar, overshares, and as a result, never gets to see the couple again.\n\nNeed proof of how bad wedding speeches can get? We recently asked comedians to share the weirdest, most half-assed wedding speeches they\u2019d ever had the displeasure of hearing. See what they had to say below.\n\nThe DUI-er\n\n\u201cAt my second wedding, my husband Mike\u2019s uncle stood up and gave a toast about how everyone rallied around him after his first DUI, but after his second and third DUI, Mike was the only person that stayed by his side. That\u2019s how he knew Mike would make a great husband, he said. He closed out the toast by telling everyone to not drink and drive as he downed a glass of champagne.\u201d \u2015 Mara Marek\n\nThe Not-So-Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\n\u201cI was at a wedding in upstate New York where the maid of honor was trying to be a comic after watching \u2018The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u2019 We were all really excited about her speech because we wanted to see her standup. The first line of her speech \u2015 \u2018I want to congratulate my best friend for marrying a guy with abs\u2019 \u2015 was met with polite laughs, which she followed with, \u2018And what\u2019s better than a guy with abs? Not having herpes.\u2019 Despite the silence and horrified faces, she continued the surprise roast with lines like, \u2018Can\u2019t wait till we\u2019re all together again for granny\u2019s funeral,\u2019 and \u2018Most marriages end in divorce but yours is special. It will end in homicide. Not sure who will kill who, but it will definitely be in self-defense.\u2019 Although she was probably only talking for about two minutes before the DJ played her off with the \u2018Austin Powers\u2019 theme, it felt like an eternity. After the speeches, the mother of the bride spent a good hour berating her near the bathrooms. Hopefully, they\u2019ll cover how to read a room in Season Two of \u2018The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u2019\u201d \u2015 Elise Golgowski\n\nThe Catfished Best Man\n\n\u201cThe best man invited his \u2018online girlfriend\u2019 Nicole to the wedding, and she said maybe, if he\u2019d pay to fly her there. She was pretty obviously catfishing him. Day of the wedding, Nicole is a no-show, no-call, and he has to change his speech in the hallway to take out all the references to his girlfriend (focus on the bride and groom next time, guy). The speech went pretty well until he just blurts out, \u2018Nicole stole my money, didn\u2019t she?\u2019\u201d \u2015 Allison Mick\n\nThe Racial Unifier\n\n\u201cAfter a number of heartfelt speeches from our closest friends at our wedding, my televangelist father-in-law got up to give one. My husband and I aren\u2019t religious, our friends are comprised of comedians, performers and activists of color. We even made it a point to not make the ceremony traditional in a religious sense; our queer friend performed the ceremony for us. Needless to say, my Southern, white father-in-law who preaches at a megachurch might\u2019ve felt like the odd man out. He walked up to the stage where my husband and I were sitting, grabbed the microphone from the stand and began to preach about bridging the gap between different types of people. Why? Nobody else pointed differences out. I sat there, thinking he was recycling an old sermon, listening at the edge of my seat while wearing a traditional Chinese qipao. \u2018I see there\u2019s a large Asian contingency here,\u2019 he said out of nowhere. The crowd of 180 people gasped. Then suddenly, almost screaming, he goes, \u2018...and I LOVE THE ASIANS.\u2019 The crowd laughed uncomfortably. My husband then motioned for him to please wrap it up.\u201d \u2015 Atsuko Okatsuka\n\nGrandpa Grumps\n\n\u201cWhen my brother-in-law got married to a British barfly he only knew for a few months, we were convinced his bride-to-be was marrying him for citizenship. During the wedding toast, his granddad spoke about lifelong partnership and soulmates and moved us all to tears with his sincere well-wishes for the both of them. There was one small problem. Granddad was somewhat hard of hearing and spoke very loudly. When he sat down, he whispered in a voice the whole room could hear, \u2018That\u2019ll never last. I give it six months, tops.\u2019 The bride\u2019s face turned as white as her dress. Turns out, he was wrong. They lasted 12 months. The exact minimum number of months it took to become a U.S. citizen!\u201d \u2015 Janet Quinonez\n\nThe Groom From Hell\n\n\u201cMy Polish friend had her wedding on Valentine\u2019s Day in Hollywood, which is how most modern nightmares begin. During the *dry* reception, her delightful husband relieved his best man from giving the speech so he could deliver a 20-minute monologue referring to the bride as his \u2018starter wife.\u2019 As if that isn\u2019t cute enough, he also told me and the other 75 guests that since she is starting a new life with him, she wouldn\u2019t be seeing any of her old friends or speaking her native language anymore. Last I heard from my friend, she ran off to Poland after they had gotten divorced a few months later.\u201d \u2015 Harper-Rose Drummond\n\nThe Bocelli Bro\n\n\u201cI was at a fraternity brother\u2019s wedding. He made a weird, I don\u2019t know, bet? We\u2019ll call it a bet. He made a bet with his best man when they were kids, whoever got married first, the other would have to sing \u2018Por Ti Volare\u2019 \u2015 that popular Andrea Bocelli song \u2015 at the other guy\u2019s wedding. Kurt got married first, so Tyler had to sing. All great, except that no one knew about the bet until afterward, so as a member of the audience, this was just a dude singing a love-themed opera ballad to another dude out of nowhere.\u201d \u2015 Jake Beckman\n\nThe Wildly Off-Topic Best Man\n\n\u201cI was at some wedding, and the best man gave a speech about his friend that involved a weird, brief, drunken tangent about not trusting people from Uruguay (neither he, the bride, nor the groom are from Uruguay. I guess this guy just had his wallet stolen there?). There\u2019s really no room for ethnic commentary in wedding speeches; everyone just sort of silently made eye contact, grabbed onto their chairs, and prayed this sentence would end and he\u2019d bring it back to how much Peter and Andie love each other.\u201d \u2015 Dan Perlman\n\nThe Pogo Sister\n\n\u201cThe groom had previously dated the sister of the bride. At their wedding, the sister was the maid of honor. During her speech, she joked about how she was such a good sister for vetting him first, both physically and mentally, before letting him marry her sister. It was taking pogo sisters to a whole new level!\u201d - Date/able podcast host Yue Xu\n\nThe Vaguely Racist Dad\n\n\u201cIn 2007, I went to an Irish wedding in my hometown of San Francisco. During the reception, the father stood up and gave a drunken toast where he said, \u2018You dated a lot of other kinds of guys, but I\u2019m glad you kept it Irish, angel.\u2019 Then he gave her a sloppy kiss on the cheek. I\u2019m black. Everyone (including my then-Irish date) at my table looked at me and said, \u2018We are soooo sorry.\u2019 I joked, \u2018Wait, you guys think I\u2019m black? I don\u2019t believe in race. So he\u2019s just a drunk asshole who just ruined his daughter\u2019s wedding party. Can somebody pass the pepper?\u2019\u201d \u2015 Kaseem Bentley\n\nThe Barcelonian By Way Of Irvine\n\n\u201cI was a bridesmaid in my friend\u2019s wedding, and one of the other bridesmaids flew in from Spain for the ceremony and apparently had gone Lindsay Lohan with a fully adopted Barcelona accent. It was like, \u2018Bitch, you grew up in Irvine; WE KNEW YOU BEFORE YOU MOVED. FOR A LONG TIME.\u2019 It was truly one of the most insane things. The balls it must take to fully commit to a full-time accent and then to unabashedly publicly speak with it at a wedding \u2015 it\u2019s so funny to me to this day. She tearfully gave a speech with a lisp! She still speaks with a lisp to this day. A blonde girl from Irvine.\u201d \u2015 Blair Socci\n\nThe Marrying Type\n\n\u201cA groom\u2019s speech I heard this past summer was funny, touching, then awkward. It ended with: \u2018So let\u2019s all raise a glass to my FIRST wife.\u2019\u201d \u2015 Christina Igaraividez\n\nThe Pious Bridesmaid\n\n\u201cI went to my extremely religious friend\u2019s wedding three days after filing for my own divorce \u2015 but I forgot to retract my plus-one. A bridesmaid asked me where my husband was. Against my better judgment, I quietly admitted to her that I had asked for a separation. It took a few seconds for me to realize that I had just copped the ultimate lady-sin to Aunt Lydia from The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and she was not happy about it. Auntie Lydz later turned her entire wedding toast into a spontaneous sermon about the sanctity of marriage, directed solely at me, of course. She hoped that the bride would submit to her husband the way God commanded, unlike some women in the room. Her words were, \u2018Best wishes to the happy couple,\u2019 but her eyes, face and general vibe said to me \u2018Burn in hell, you unwashed heathen.\u2019\u201d \u2015 Vanessa Gritton\n\nThe IDGAF Uncle\n\n\u201cI went to one wedding where the bride\u2019s whole family hated the man she was marrying. When it came time for speeches, her uncle gave the toast: \u2018Sometimes you just gotta rock on and move on.\u2019 And that was it. That was the whole thing.\u201d \u2015 David Drake", "President Donald Trump will \u2014 again \u2014 be skipping the Kennedy Center Honors this year, becoming the first president in the gala\u2019s 41-year history to decline an invitation more than once.\n\nA spokeswoman for Melania Trump confirmed to USA Today on Tuesday that, because of scheduling conflicts, neither the first lady nor the president would be attending the event \u2014 an annual affair that honors those in the performing arts for their contributions to American culture.\n\nTrump is scheduled to travel to Argentina to attend the G-20 summit, slated to take place from Nov. 30 to Dec. 1. The Kennedy Center Honors will be held on Dec. 2 in the Opera House in Washington.\n\nThis year\u2019s honorees are singer-actress Cher, composer Philip Glass, country music star Reba McEntire and jazz legend Wayne Shorter. \u201cHamilton\u201d creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and his co-collaborators will also be receiving a special award for their \u201cunprecedented work.\u201d\n\nThis is the second year in a row that President Trump and his wife will be a no-show at the gala. In 2017, the Trumps said they wouldn\u2019t attend the event to \u201callow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction.\u201d Their statement followed the announcement by several honorees, including TV producer Norman Lear and legendary dancer Carmen de Lavallade, that they were boycotting or considering boycotting at least part of the ceremony because of the political climate.\n\nDe Lavallade blamed \u201cthe socially divisive and morally caustic narrative that our current leadership is choosing to engage in\u201d as the reason behind her boycott. Lear skewered the Trump administration for threatening to get rid of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\nSeveral of this year\u2019s nominees have been similarly vocal in their condemnation of the president and his policies. Glass has referred to Trump as an idiot; Cher has compared him to \u201cHitler\u201d (and has said she\u2019d be \u201cthrilled\u201d if Trump does not attend the gala); and Miranda excoriated the president\u2019s response to Puerto Rico\u2019s post-Hurricane Maria devastation, telling him \u201cyou\u2019re going straight to hell.\u201d\n\nAs The Washington Post noted, the sitting president has attended the Honors every year since 1978 with just a handful of exceptions. Jimmy Carter did not attend in 1979 because of the ongoing Iran hostage crisis. In 1989 and 1994, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, respectively, were not present because of overseas trips. And in 2015, Barack Obama arrived late to the event after delivering a primetime address to the nation from the Oval Office.\n\nIn all those cases, the first ladies served as hosts, the Post reported.\n\nSome Twitter users reacted to the Trumps\u2019 decision to skip this year\u2019s Honors with disappointment and disdain.\n\nNot surprising obviously.

The court\u2019s spokeswoman said she \u201cexperienced discomfort\u201d overnight, however, and went to George Washington University Hospital, where tests showed the extent of her injuries the next day. She was released Friday.\n\nThe event prompted an outpouring of support and worry from Ginsburg\u2019s supporters, who view her as the lynchpin of the court\u2019s liberal bloc. Some even joked about donating their ribs to her so she could recover quickly.\n\nJIM WATSON via Getty Images Ginsburg has had several health scares during her tenure on the Supreme Court, but she regularly returns to work.\n\nGinsburg, the oldest member of the court, is a cancer survivor and has had several health scares in recent years, including a separate episode in which she fractured some ribs. At the same time, the justice is known for her regular exercise routine and meets with a personal trainer several times a week for hourlong sessions.\n\n\u201cThe whole time that I\u2019ve trained the justice, the one word she has never used with me is \u2019can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d the trainer, Bryant Johnson, told The New York Times earlier this year. \u201cEven when I told her we were going to do push-ups \u2014 she looked at me with a side-eye, like maybe I was locked on stupid and stuck on dumb. But she didn\u2019t say anything. And when Justice Ginsburg finally did push-ups off her knees, she lit up.\u201d\n\nJohnson told Vox on Tuesday that Ginsburg will resume her workouts next week even as she recovers, commenting that she was \u201ctough as nails.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith three cracked ribs, I won\u2019t have her on the elliptical right away,\u201d he told the news outlet. \u201cMy warm-up will be gentler \u2014 and then we\u2019ll adjust accordingly.\u201d", "WASHINGTON \u2015 Jeffrey Clark \u2014 the 30-year-old man federal agents arrested here Friday after he said the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting victims \u201cdeserved exactly what happened to them and so much worse\u201d and his relatives worried he might try to launch a race war \u2014 wasn\u2019t shy about being a neo-Nazi.\n\nIn April 2017, when someone asked Clark at a White House rally organized by \u201calt-right\u201d coiner Richard Spencer whether he considered himself a fascist, he said no \u2015 he considered himself a Nazi. Antifa activists photographed him at the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. He has posed for pictures in front of Nazi symbols and holding Nazi memorabilia.\n\nOn Gab, the favored social network of racists and anti-Semites, Clark had the username @PureWhiteEvil and called himself \u201cDC Bowl Gang,\u201d a reference to Dylann Roof, the bowl-cut racist who murdered nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.\n\nHuffPost Jeffrey Clark and his Gab gang made a hero of church killer Dylann Roof.\n\nMany alt-right white supremacists worship Roof, and Clark used an image of the killer and balaclava-clad gunmen as the header for his Gab page. His pinned image was an altered still from the video game \u201cDoom\u201d that depicted Roof executing black people in a church.\n\nHuffPost\n\nThis April, Clark threatened a HuffPost reporter, warning that the reporter would be going \u201cfeet first into a woodchipper.\u201d The reporter told police about the threat in August. They did nothing at the time. In late October, D.C. police did come to Clark\u2019s house in the Bloomingdale neighborhood after the death by suicide of his brother, Edward, but did not arrest him.\n\nOn Oct. 26, Clark defended Cesar Sayoc, the Florida Trump supporter accused of sending pipe bombs to prominent Democrats. \u201cNah he was BASED! Get used to it libtards. This was just a dry run for things to come,\u201d Clark wrote on Gab in response to another user critical of Sayoc. Clark\u2019s Gab profile is no longer online, but HuffPost viewed archives of the posts, which were collected by data scientist Jason Baumgartner.\n\nThe FBI incorrectly suggested in its affidavit that Clark\u2019s \u201cdry run\u201d post referred to Robert Bowers, the man charged with murdering 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Oct. 27. NBC first reported the discrepancy. The FBI declined to comment.\n\nAfter the Pittsburgh shooting, Clark told family members he thought he had been \u201cfriended\u201d on Gab by Bowers. Clark wrote on Gab that \u201cthe fucking kikes that got shot by the hero #RobertBowers were all active supporters of pedophilia \u2026 and every last one of them deserved exactly what happened to them and so much worse,\u201d according to court documents. Pedophilia-centric conspiracy theories are popular among members of the far-right; in 2016, a North Carolina man armed with a rifle drove to a Washington, D.C., pizza place he falsely believed was the center of a vast pedophilia ring. No one was injured in the shooting.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until November, after Clark\u2019s own family contacted law enforcement, that the FBI finally found the allegedly illegal weapons that have him facing gun charges. Court documents, as well as photos and videos obtained by HuffPost, suggest Clark\u2019s late brother, Edward Clark, shared a similar ideology. That both men were able to spew neo-Nazi rhetoric, amass an arsenal of weapons, and openly threaten journalists and critics for months without consequence shows just how much freedom far-right extremists have to operate in the U.S. \u2014 and how far their behavior has to escalate before law enforcement takes it seriously.\n\nWhite Supremacy, At Home In DC\n\nClark lived in a rowhouse in Bloomingdale with his father, sister and younger brother Edward William \u201cTeddy\u201d Clark, who killed himself on Washington\u2019s Theodore Roosevelt Island on Oct. 27, the day of the Tree of Life shooting.\n\nNo one answered the door Tuesday night at the Bloomingdale home, which was completely dark except for a television flickering in an upstairs room.\n\n\u201cI was waiting for these boys to step out of line,\u201d one neighbor, who asked for anonymity out of concern for their safety, told HuffPost. That neighbor, who was aware of Clark\u2019s neo-Nazi leanings and monitored his Twitter account, said that the Clarks, until a few years ago, were one of the only white families on the block, which is in a historically black neighborhood near Howard University that has gotten dramatically whiter and richer in recent years.\n\nI was waiting for these boys to step out of line. A neighbor of Jeffrey and Edward Clark\n\nThe neighbor said that last year several similarly dressed white men gathered at the Clark home around the time of an alt-right free speech rally in the city. The neighbor heard the group chanting what sounded like \u201cSieg Heil.\u201d When white supremacy flyers appeared in the neighborhood and a gay pride flag was torn down from the window of the nearby bar Showtime, the neighbor suspected the Clark boys were involved.\n\nLaura Sennett Jeffrey Clark, far left next to his brother Edward.\n\nFinding Their Place In The Far-Right\n\nThe Clark brothers appear to have been trying to find their footing in the far-right political scene over the past several years, showing up at \u201cBuild the Wall\u201d rallies outside the White House or at events with Spencer. One of them tried to join Identity Evropa, a prominent white nationalist organization, but was rejected, according to a source in the organization.\n\nIn May 2017, the Clark brothers teamed up with far-right \u201cPizzagate\u201d propagandist Jack Posobiec, who was then the D.C. bureau chief for the far-right website Rebel Media, to shoot footage for a film Posobiec was working on about Seth Rich, the Democratic National Committee staffer whose murder near the Clarks\u2019 home in Bloomingdale has spawned numerous far-right conspiracy theories.\n\nLaura Sennett, an anti-fascist researcher who works with One People\u2019s Project, spoke with Jeffrey Clark a few weeks after he and his brother were spotted in Bloomingdale with Posobiec, who by then had been fired from Rebel under mysterious circumstances after plagiarizing Jason Kessler, the white nationalist who organized the Unite the Right rally.\n\n\u201c[Clark] told me that Jack Posobiec hired him and his brother to follow him with a camera to take video of his investigation of Seth Rich,\u201d Sennett told HuffPost. \u201cNot sure if it was a documentary or a news story, but [Posobiec] was doing some kind of reporting for Rebel Media. I asked him if Posobiec was aware of his Nazi beliefs. He told me that Posobiec absolutely was and had told Jeff that he was sympathetic to those beliefs.\u201d\n\nPhoto taken by a source who spotted Jack Posobiec Conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec being followed by the Clark brothers as they videotape him.\n\nPosobiec, now a host for the conservative One America News Network, denies this. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a Jeffrey Clark,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never hired anyone for Rebel Media, certainly not hired this person, and I never made a Seth Rich documentary for Rebel Media.\u201d\n\nBut there was Posobiec last year, traipsing around Bloomingdale with the Clarks:\n\nPHOTO TAKEN BY A SOURCE WHO SPOTTED JACK POSOBIEC\n\nKnocking on doors, a microphone in his hand:\n\nPHOTO TAKEN BY A SOURCE WHO SPOTTED JACK POSOBIEC\n\nJeffrey Clark also found a common cause with violent white supremacists on Gab, where he posted neo-Nazi propaganda and promoted prominent white nationalist voices such as Patrick Little, Brad Griffin, Jared Wyand and \u201cJack Corbin\u201d \u2015 all of whom Tree of Life shooter Robert Bowers also engaged with on the social media platform. He amplified older white nationalists such as Billy Roper and Peter Brimelow, and expressed his support for white nationalist Republican House candidate Paul Nehlen.\n\nClark\u2019s Gab profile picture was a photo of him and his brother wearing masks and holding guns in front of a flag with a skull and crossbones, according to court documents. The skull has a bowl haircut, another reference to Roof. Edward Clark went by \u201cDC_Stormer\u201d on Gab, according to the FBI. A Twitter account with the same user name is currently suspended. Previously, that account, which antifa activists believed to be linked to one or both of the Clark brothers, posted thinly veiled threats aimed at local antifa activists.\n\nSeveral of the internet service providers who worked with Gab abandoned the social media platform after the Pittsburgh shooting brought public attention to how easy it is for leading extremists to connect with individuals on Gab who might carry out white nationalism\u2019s violent ideology.\n\nHuffPost\n\nRegarding death threats, here's a note from right-wing Jeffery Raph Clark, @dc_stormer, who lives in DC area and has come to #antifa events. pic.twitter.com/bTRTQRH2By \u2014 Lacy MacAuley (@lacymacauley) July 4, 2017\n\nHow It All Came Crashing Down\n\nThe Clarks\u2019 history of extremism ended in the death of one brother and the arrest of another over the past two weeks. Edward Clark killed himself with a Beretta pistol on Oct. 27 sometime before 12:45 p.m., according to court documents. Responding officers found eight remaining rounds in the magazine of his pistol, as well as two additional magazines of ammunition with 20 more rounds. Family members told FBI agents they were surprised by Edward\u2019s suicide and did not know why he had so many bullets on him.\n\nCourt documents imply that Jeffrey knew his brother was up to something unusual on the day of his death. Jeffrey woke up around noon that day. When he realized Edward wasn\u2019t home, he called his mother and said he was going to report Edward missing to the police, even though Edward was 23 and hadn\u2019t been gone for long.\n\nJeffrey is the registered owner of a Remington Arms 1911 R1 handgun and a Mossberg Maverick 88 shotgun. His brother was the registered owner of a Ruger Mini 14 Ranch Rifle and a Beretta 92FS handgun, the gun he used to kill himself. Officers later recovered a Colt .38 Jeffrey gave to a family member that was not registered to either Clark brother. D.C. law requires registration of all firearms with local police.\n\nA D.C. homicide detective went to the Clarks\u2019 home after Edward\u2019s death. Jeffrey told him that Edward\u2019s rifle was still at the house, but the detective did not ask Jeffrey about his guns, according to court documents.\n\nTwo family members called the FBI on Nov. 2 to express concerns about Jeffrey, whom they said had become more outspoken about his white nationalist views after his brother\u2019s death. Jeffrey and Edward \u201chad both fantasized about killing \u2018Jews and blacks,\u2019\u201d and admired mass murderers Timothy McVeigh, Ted Kaczynski and Charles Manson, according to court documents. Family members told the FBI that Jeffrey was \u201creally riled up\u201d and \u201cagitated,\u201d and they feared he would hurt himself or others. The brothers believed there would be a race revolution, and they wanted to expedite it.\n\nFamily members showed FBI agents four boxes of gun parts they took from Jeffrey, including parts used to modify AR-15 assault rifles. Agents also found four high-capacity AR-15 magazines that can hold up to 30 rounds of ammunition. Possession of such magazines is prohibited under D.C. law.\n\nJeffrey and Edward\u2019s relatives confirmed they both attended the 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. They believed there were photos of the brothers online standing next to James Alex Fields, the white supremacist who drove a car into protesters, killing Heather Heyer and injuring several others. They showed FBI agents a picture of the brothers holding a flag for the white supremacist group Vanguard America \u2015 the same group on the flyers posted around Bloomingdale.\n\nThe brothers marched into the Charlottesville rally behind that flag, which was carried by William Fears, a white supremacist arrested for attempted homicide after a Spencer speech in Gainesville, Florida, last year. Prosecutors ultimately dropped that case against Fears, who was arrested again this April for allegedly hitting and choking his girlfriend.\n\nLuke Osman\n\nFBI agents spoke with one of the Clarks\u2019 relatives again on Nov. 8. The relative told them that Jeffrey smoked and sold marijuana. They also observed propane torches in the house that are \u201cconsistent with those used for smoking methamphetamine,\u201d according to court documents.\n\nJeffrey described himself on Gab as \u201cAka DC Stormer (RIP), \u201cMeth-Smoking, Pipe Bomb making, mailman-murding,#Fed,#DemoKKKrat, Che Guevara of the altright, Glenn beck, Not a NEET \u2013 just bathing in White priviledge, Bowlcut Nationalism is the only way forward. . .\u201d\n\nJeffrey was arrested on Friday and charged with the federal crime of illegally possessing a firearm while using or addicted to a controlled substance, and the D.C. crime of possessing a high-capacity magazine.\n\nDavid Bos, the federal public defender assigned to Jeffrey\u2019s case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead the court documents here:", "TONIGHT: Melania is calling for the removal of a national security aide.

The Camp fire up north was 35 percent contained, Cal Fire officials said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are not fully out of the woods yet,\u201d Cal Fire officials told reporters Tuesday, noting the areas affected by the Camp fire were still \u201cextraordinarily dry\u201d and \u201cquite ready for continued fire growth.\u201d A National Weather Service meteorologist noted that rains weren\u2019t expected to come to the area until Thanksgiving next week.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Search and rescue workers search for human remains at a trailer park burned in the Camp fire on Nov. 13, 2018, in Paradise, California.\n\nPresident Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration for California Monday, which will allow access to federal funding and other resources to help those affected by the fires.\n\nHonea said earlier this week that law enforcement would be getting \u201ccadaver\u201d dogs to detect bodies left in the ashes of the Camp fire and a \u201crapid DNA system\u201d to identify the victims. Officials put in an order for 100 National Guard troops to assist in searching for human remains, he said Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to realize the scope of what took place without being in the middle of it,\u201d Cal Fire public information officer Scott McLean told HuffPost earlier this week, noting that this fire spread so fast that its flames burned up \u201cthe length of a football field in the matter of a second or two.\u201d\n\nThe previous deadliest single fire was the 1933 Griffith Park fire, which killed 29. The Camp fire\u2019s death toll also surpassed that of multiple fires in Sonoma and Napa counties last year that left 44 dead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done away with the \u2018new\u2019 part of the \u2018new normal\u2019 a year ago,\u201d McLean said, referring to the deadly fires that hit Northern California last year. He warned Californians to always be prepared in case a fire hits by having a go-bag ready and evacuating \u201cwithout hesitation.\u201d", "WASHINGTON \u2015 Nancy Pelosi\u2019s bid to become House speaker again is running up against dueling realities: One reality is that she is the most capable Democrat in the House, confident the party\u2019s gains were significant enough to propel her to the speakership, and another reality is that about two dozen Democrats are prepared to block her from the spot.\n\nNeither scenario seems entirely right or entirely wrong.\n\nPelosi continues to express optimism that she can outmaneuver any contingent of Democrats standing in her way from once again ascending from minority leader to speaker. She\u2019s wooing freshman Democrats, showing up to orientation sessions, hosting dinner receptions and making friends.\n\nBut there\u2019s confidence from Pelosi\u2019s detractors that she doesn\u2019t have the votes.\n\nRep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) told reporters Tuesday night that he was \u201c100 percent\u201d confident there were enough votes to block Pelosi \u2015 more than 20 \u2015 during a speaker floor vote. He said the anti-Pelosi members planned to release a letter demonstrating to Pelosi that she doesn\u2019t have the votes, at which point they expect other Democrats to step up and run for the speaker position.\n\nMoulton said the members, led by less than a dozen existing Representatives and some incoming Democrats who have said they won\u2019t support Pelosi, are figuring out when to release the letter \u2015 \u201cwe\u2019re going to see what makes the most sense\u201d \u2015 but they plan to do it before the caucus votes for its leaders behind closed doors at the end of November.\n\nTo be speaker, a Democrat would have to win that election among just Democrats in November, but he or she would also have to win an election among the full House on Jan. 3. If current projections hold, Democrats look like they\u2019ll have a majority of 233 to 235 members out of 435 total, meaning Pelosi could lose 15 to 17 votes and still be elected speaker.\n\nBut the math is even more complicated and forgiving to Pelosi. If she could convince some Democrats to vote present, as two Democratic sources have told HuffPost she is trying to do, she could lower the threshold to be speaker to under 218 and potentially secure the vote with less than an actual majority on the floor.\n\nMoulton, however, says no one in his group is interested in voting present. \u201cImagine a candidate, coming and taking their first vote on the floor of the House of Representatives \u2015 present?\u201d he said.\n\nMoulton said he had another member approach him a couple of hours before House votes Tuesday night about not supporting Pelosi, and yet another member came to him on the floor during votes. He thinks the numbers are quite stark for Pelosi.\n\nBut Pelosi\u2019s contingent sees the numbers going the other way.\n\nThey point to a letter signed by 11 Democrats asking for a proposed speaker rule change \u2015 a letter that one of the Democrats, Albio Sires (D-N.J.), is now removed from after he came out in support of Pelosi on Friday.\n\nStill, that leaves Moulton, Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.), Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.), Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), Filemon Vela Jr. (D-Texas), Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), Bill Foster (D-Ill.) and Brian Higgins (D-N.Y.).\n\nOn top of that, you have Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), who has traditionally voted against Pelosi, Conor Lamb (D-Pa.), who has consistently said he won\u2019t support her to be speaker, and a handful of incoming Democrats who have said \u2015 to varying degrees \u2015 that they also won\u2019t vote for her, including Jason Crow (D-Colo.), Andy Kim (D-N.J.), Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.), Jeff Van Drew (D-N.J.), Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.), Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), Anthony Brindisi (D-N.Y.), Max Rose (D-N.Y.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and Haley Stevens (D-Mich.).\n\nDemocrats from at least three uncalled races \u2015 Jared Golden (D-Maine), Ben McAdams (D-Utah) and Gil Cisneros (D-Calif.) \u2015 have also said they won\u2019t support Pelosi.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see how Pelosi\u2019s vote problem isn\u2019t fake. But it\u2019s also difficult to see who would be speaker if it\u2019s not her.\n\nMinority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) seems eternally stuck at the No. 2 spot in Democratic leadership. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), currently the assistant minority leader, could be a natural contender, but he says he backs Pelosi, though he also told HuffPost on Tuesday night that, if he were elected speaker, he would serve.\n\nThe fresher faces of Democratic leadership \u2015 people like Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) \u2015 seem more interested in moving one rung up the ladder than they are in mounting an actual speaker bid. Jeffries, who is in a race with Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) to be conference chair, coyly told HuffPost on Tuesday night that he still has trouble seeing himself as a member of Congress let alone speaker, and Bustos is focused on her race to become the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) and Denny Heck (D-Wash.) are also vying to be DCCC chair.\n\nThe former DCCC chairman, Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico, is in a race to become the assistant majority leader with David Cicilline of Rhode Island, and Luj\u00e1n could be a contender for the speakership if Pelosi were blocked.\n\nIn short, there are plenty of potential candidates \u2015 and none at all.\n\nAsked about how the Pelosi defectors could beat somebody with nobody, Moulton seemed undeterred, saying there was plenty of talent in the Democratic Caucus.\n\nMoulton was also unafraid of a potential backlash to blocking Pelosi \u2015 the only woman to ever serve as speaker. He said he would prefer the next speaker be another woman, and he pointed to polling that, he said, shows most Democrats want new leadership.\n\nMoulton was the focus of some dismissive remarks from Pelosi earlier this year, when she told Rolling Stone that he and Ohio\u2019s Tim Ryan were both \u201cinconsequential.\u201d\n\nThe anti-Pelosi members have had trouble organizing a convincing campaign thus far. When Ryan was asked about Pelosi on Tuesday night, he barely said anything other than unhelpfully telling reporters that there was \u201ca lot of conversations.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a question about whether the Pelosi detractors will try to get another rule change vote Wednesday morning, or whether one of Pelosi\u2019s allies would potentially bring up their motion and have it voted down.\n\nBut their machinations could quickly become real if they can release a letter with 20 Democrats who vow not to support Pelosi. That would put the California Democrat in a tough position, as she would need some of those Democrats to go back on their word, or she would need Republicans to vote for her.\n\nNeither outcome seems all that likely, but most Democratic members still seem to believe Pelosi can work her way out of this.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to be light-years ahead of anyone in our caucus,\u201d Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) told HuffPost.", "Clarence House released two new portraits of Prince Charles and his family to mark the heir to the British throne\u2019s 70th birthday on Wednesday.\n\nFlanked by his children and grandchildren, the Prince of Wales juggles a giggling Prince George on one knee in one photo while his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall sits beside Princess Charlotte.\n\nThe photographs showcase a new side to Charles that the public doesn\u2019t often see, and there\u2019s no denying he looks right at home playing the role of grandfather.\n\nGetty photographer Chris Jackson said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d that Clarence House asked him to take the shots.", "Georgia state Sen.

But Kemp, who oversaw the election as secretary of state, is accused of rampant voter suppression and has lost several court cases over his attempts to block voters of color from the polls. His opponent, Abrams, is about 58,000 votes behind him as ballot counts are still being finalized, but she needs only about 20,000 more votes to force a runoff.

Aside from the billions in tax incentives most locales offered, here\u2019s a look at five of the most outrageous things governments brought to the table \u2015 often at the expense of taxpayers.\n\nFree Pets, Hotel Rooms, Aquarium Memberships And More\n\nDallas is perhaps the best instance of a city\u2019s willingness to sweeten the deal with extravagant perks, offering up taxpayer dollars to provide free things to Amazon employees.\n\nThat offer included free one-year memberships to the Dallas Zoo, Dallas Children\u2019s Aquarium, Dallas Arboretum, Texas Discovery Gardens and the Trinity River Audubon Center for any employee hired between 2019 and 2021, and waived pet adoption fees at the Dallas Animal Services adoption center for Amazon employees until 2022.\n\nOne of the pricier perks offered was an estimated $1.5 million in free rides on \u201cshuttles, pedicabs, courtesy carts, or other quick transit solutions\u201d to help HQ2 employees get around while the city improves its transit system.\n\nAdditionally, Dallas offered the company 2,000 free nights at a city-owned hotel and 100 free days of event space.\n\nRenaming Public Property For Amazon\n\nThe state of Georgia said Amazon would have the opportunity to rename streets around a future campus in Atlanta.\n\nSuggestions included Amazon Lane, Alexa Way, Prime Place and Kindle Rd.\n\n\u201cSimply put, Atlanta has a long history of Amazon love,\u201d the state said in its attempt to woo the company.\n\nIt also promised to explore the possibility of turning one of Atlanta\u2019s MARTA transit cars into a vehicle for transporting Amazon products around the metropolitan area.\n\nNotice If The Media Is Looking Into Amazon\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the helicopter landing pad that helped Virginia win over a slice of the new Amazon headquarters. As part of its offer, the state will notify the company within two days of receiving any Freedom of Information Act requests about Amazon \u201cto allow the Company to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.\u201d\n\nFOIA requests are often filed by members of the media to obtain previously unreleased information or documents controlled by the U.S. government. For example, it was through a FOIA request that The Daily Beast revealed last month that Amazon had met with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to pitch the agency on its facial recognition surveillance technology.\n\nA Say In How Taxes Would Be Spent\n\nFresno, California, offered Amazon the chance to be the \u201cultimate corporate citizen,\u201d as Fresno Mayor Lee Brand described it to KQED, by letting Amazon have joint say with the city in how the taxes the company paid would be spent.\n\nThe deal would have established a so-called Amazon Community Fund for Amazon\u2019s tax money to be managed by five people: two elected officials, one community representative and two Amazon appointees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a proposal to give a company formal control,\u201d Greg LeRoy, executive director of the economic development nonprofit Good Jobs First, told KQED. \u201cThat\u2019s really off the charts.\u201d\n\nA \u2018Blank Check\u2019 For Transit Projects\n\nWhile many bids include promises to make transit easier for HQ2 employees, Maryland Transportation Secretary Pete K. Rahn took things a step further in the state\u2019s bid.\n\n\u201cOur statement for HQ2 is we\u2019ll provide whatever is necessary to Amazon when they need it,\u201d he told state senators during a hearing on his department\u2019s budget. \u201cFor all practical purposes, it\u2019s a blank check.\u201d", "After 14 months, two rounds and 238 bids, Amazon finally decided to split its second headquarters between the two most obvious locations imaginable: New York City and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe process of identifying the company\u2019s \u201cHQ2\u201d location pitted cities against each other, incentivizing them to offer the largest tax breaks and the most slickly produced marketing campaigns to capture Amazon\u2019s attention. Chicago offered to give highly paid tech workers their state income taxes back to them. Fresno was fine with letting Amazon decide how to distribute its tax revenue. Calgary, Canada, put up banners near the company\u2019s headquarters in Seattle reading, \u201cHey Amazon, we\u2019re not saying we would fight a bear for you \u2026 but we totally would.\u201d In a bizarre inversion of municipal corruption, the city of Tucson sent a 21-foot cactus to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos \u2015 who announced he was returning it for ethical reasons.\n\nAll of these efforts were aimed at landing the big prize: $5 billion in investment and 50,000 new jobs. After the announcement that Long Island City, in the Queens borough, would host half of the new HQ2, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted, \u201cNew York City is about to get tens of thousands of new, good paying jobs and Amazon is about to meet the most talented workforce in the world.\u201d Allison Silberberg, the mayor of Alexandria, Virginia, which will host the other half of HQ2 along with Arlington, said her city\u2019s bid was successful due to \u201cthe collective strengths of our communities \u2015 our workforce, education, infrastructure and our unparalleled quality of life \u2015 all of which will be strengthened by this new investment from Amazon.\u201d\n\nOthers were less enthusiastic. New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said he was excluded from the negotiations with the company and that he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the details of the subsidy agreement. New York Assemblyman Ron Kim (D) introduced legislation to block the deal and spend the funds forgiving student debt instead. Even before the bids were announced, activists in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Chicago and Atlanta demanded city lawmakers release their bids to the public or rescind them altogether.\n\nThe year-plus bidding process was a cynical ploy at worst and a huge waste of time at best. After shortlisting proposals from Miss Congeniality candidates Indianapolis and Raleigh, North Carolina, Amazon ultimately chose two large, established American cities that offered millions of educated workers, existing tech clusters and proximity to financial and political capital. Bezos even owns homes in both cities already.\n\n\u201cBy using this process, Amazon was able to get cities to offer up bigger and better incentives than they otherwise would have,\u201d said Greg Squires, a George Washington University researcher who studies urban development. Jay Carney, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide corporate affairs, made this explicit Tuesday, stating that the talent pool \u2015 i.e., not the tax incentives \u2015 was the primary reason Amazon chose Arlington and Long Island City.\n\nBut the implications of Amazon\u2019s announcement go far beyond one company or two cities. The ugliness of the last 14 months highlights a growing challenge for cities and politicians who run them. According to a March 2018 report by the Brookings Institution, state and local governments dole out up to $90 billion worth of subsidies to individual businesses each year. As cities compete to give away more tax revenue and larger incentives to companies, they may lose track of the line between investing in their communities and exploiting them.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Amazon's new location outside Washington, D.C.\n\nWhy Do Cities Offer Tax Breaks Anyway?\n\nThe entire HQ2 process took place under a series of assumptions with little support in academic research.\n\n\u201cThis whole notion of providing financial incentives to businesses has been a losing proposition for most communities that have ever engaged in it,\u201d Squires said. Cities generally end up giving tax breaks to corporations that were going to relocate there anyway. Companies often don\u2019t hire local workers and, if they do, it\u2019s rarely the populations that need jobs the most.\n\nThe reason financial incentives are a losing proposition for economic development, Squires said, is that taxes don\u2019t make up a significant cost for companies when compared to other fundamentals, like the cost of utilities, recruitment and supply chains. \u201cIf Phoenix is the ideal place for a company to do business,\u201d Squires said, \u201cDetroit isn\u2019t going to get them with a big tax break.\u201d\n\nBut even by the standards of tax breaks, the HQ2 process was more crude and ad hoc than usual.\n\n\u201cEverything we know about incentives was just tossed out the window,\u201d said Nathan Jensen, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin who specializes in state and local development. Some cities were offering 30 years of exemptions on utility and income taxes. Since most companies plan only five to 10 years into the future, these incentives are worth almost nothing. \u201cIt has no effect as an enticement,\u201d Jensen said, \u201cbut it imposes a massive burden on taxpayers.\u201d\n\nNegotiators also overlooked the social and political effects of financial incentives. The sudden addition of 25,000 jobs can be a disruptive event. It means more kids in schools, more cars on the road, more tenants competing for housing and more pressure on every municipal service from parks to sewers to firefighting. Under normal circumstances, this influx of population is balanced by additional tax revenue. But when cities negotiate the revenue away, it simply shifts the costs of those services onto their residents.\n\nIn the long run, this can result in political tensions, disgruntled populations, threats of budget cuts and tensions between the company and the community \u2015 everything, in other words, that has happened in Seattle since Amazon began its aggressive expansion there in 2010. \u201cThe winner of this competition may turn out to be a big loser,\u201d Squires said.\n\nSo if financial incentives are so bad, why are politicians still offering them? Squires said corporate welfare falls into the gap between the long-term effects of tax breaks and the short-term rewards for politicians. \u201cA mayor can make an announcement or have a ribbon-cutting ceremony, but they won\u2019t be around to see what happens. Plus, if they appease a major employer, it could be easier to raise money next time they run for office.\u201d\n\nAgence-France Presse Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos already owns homes in Washington, D.C., and New York City.\n\nNot All Tax Incentives Are Created Equal\n\nBut the problem isn\u2019t just the tax breaks Long Island City and Arlington are offering Amazon. It\u2019s how those tax breaks will be applied.\n\nIn the news release announcing its decision, Amazon noted that it will receive \u201cperformance-based direct incentives\u201d of $1.525 billion in Long Island City and $573 million in Arlington in exchange for creating 50,000 high-paying jobs. The company is also receiving various other forms of state aid and has committed to funding \u201ccommunity infrastructure improvements,\u201d including donating space on its New York campus to a public school.\n\nWhat isn\u2019t clear, however, is how these commitments will be monitored and which tax incentives can be revoked if Amazon does not live up to its end of the bargain. While the state of Virginia has committed to monitoring the company\u2019s job-creation targets, documents released by New York state so far comprise only a nonbinding memorandum of understanding that appears to include no verification or audit requirements.\n\n\u201cWe need sincere third-party evaluations of what has been offered and what the company is giving back,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cThat\u2019s the minimum. If the company says it\u2019s going to invest in the community and hire locally, OK fine. Prove it.\u201d\n\nPlus, Jensen said, neither agreement seems to include an evaluation to determine whether the investments of $48,000 per job (New York) and $22,000 per job (Virginia) will bring back more in revenue than what they gave away. It\u2019s a common problem among cities: They believe the promises of companies in advance of a deal but neglect to verify that these commitments are carried out and that the community truly benefited from the arrangement afterward.\n\nThere\u2019s also the issue of transparency. Negotiations with Amazon were carried out without the participation of city residents or even politicians. Now that the locations have been announced, the commitments and obligations of the company and various government agencies are still unclear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate so much of this was done in secrecy,\u201d Squires said. \u201cResidents have a right to know how their tax dollars are being used.\u201d\n\nAmazon is unlikely to be the last company to stage a nationwide beauty pageant to get lower tax rates and higher subsidies. In response to this problem, the European Union has made it illegal for its member countries to offer incentives to specific companies. While some poorer regions are still allowed to offer rewards, the process is done within clear limits and with full transparency. The United States has no similar national framework.\n\nWhat cities should be competing on, Squires said, is amenities that improve communities and invite businesses of all kinds: Improving schools, building infrastructure, keeping libraries open and collecting the garbage every week. If the tax money spent on Amazon had been invested in better subways, subsidized child care or universal early education programs, the states may have created even more jobs than the tech giant ever will.\n\n\u201cTake care of public services,\u201d Squires said, \u201cand the rest will take care of itself.\u201d", "NEW YORK \u2015 The Census Bureau\u2019s top scientist testified Tuesday that neither he nor other top Census officials thought the decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census was a good idea.\n\nThe scientist, John Abowd, supervised a team of Census Bureau researchers that studied the effect of adding the question and ultimately advised against it in January. Abowd met with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross only one time to discuss his recommendation, in February, before Ross ultimately decided to add the question.\n\nAbowd testified Tuesday that he and other top Census Bureau officials were surprised to learn in June that Ross was interested in adding the question months before he even began the possibility of studying it. Ross initially said that he began considering the question only after the Justice Department requested it in December so that it could better enforce the Voting Rights Act.\n\nAbowd\u2019s testimony came as part of an ongoing federal lawsuit challenging the Trump administration\u2019s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. Abowd\u2019s analysis of the effect of the citizenship question is one of the most important pieces of evidence in the suit for the plaintiffs \u201518 states, the District of Columbia, several cities and a handful of immigrant groups \u2015 who say the decision to add the question was motivated by discriminatory intent and ignored clear evidence that adding the question would decrease the number of people who respond to the census. An inaccurate census would have far-reaching consequences, since the survey is used to draw electoral districts and allocate hundreds of billions of dollars of federal funds.\n\nAbowd was repeatedly questioned Tuesday about a January memo he wrote to Ross in which he advised against adding the citizenship question. In the memo, Abowd said it would be very costly and harm the quality of the census count. He also said any citizenship data collected in a census would be substantially less accurate than information that\u2019s available from administrative sources. He recommended that the Census Bureau get citizenship data from existing government records.\n\nDale Ho, the director of the ACLU\u2019s voting rights project, pressed Abowd about a separate Census Bureau estimate showing that the non-response rate to a census survey with a citizenship question on it increased more among households with at least one non-citizen in it than it did among households of all U.S. citizens. Abowd testified that the Census Bureau was estimating the effect of the citizenship question based on the best information it had and could have better studied the question if it had more notice of the request to add the question because it could have done a randomized control trial.\n\nHo\u2019s questions to Abowd were meant to undercut Ross\u2019s March memo justifying the decision to add the citizenship question. In the memo, Ross said he set out to take a \u201chard look\u201d at the possibility of adding a citizenship question and that there was little empirical evidence that adding the question would lead to a decline in response rates.\n\nA Commerce Department spokesman said in a statement Tuesday evening that Ross considered Abowd\u2019s input along with that of other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cUnder authority granted to the Secretary of Commerce, Ross determined that the addition of the question, combined with administrative records, would provide the best results to fulfill DOJ\u2019s request. While his decision was ultimately different from Dr. Abowd\u2019s recommendation, the Secretary reached his decision, in part, due to the Census Bureau\u2019s assurances that any drop in self-response rates can and will be remediated by non-response follow operations,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAbowd\u2019s testimony suggested that, based on the Census Bureau\u2019s review of the existing data, adding a citizenship question would decrease the response rate.\n\nEven though Abowd and his team had developed an analysis of the downside of a citizenship question, Department of Justice officials did not want to meet with them to discuss alternatives. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions blocked Justice Department officials from discussing alternatives, a top official in the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division said in a deposition.\n\nAbowd said it was unusual for an agency not to meet with the Census Bureau to follow up on a request for data.\n\nAbowd\u2019s testimony is expected to continue Wednesday, when he is expected to face questioning from Justice Department attorneys.", "Investigators are appealing to the public for help in identifying the person responsible for the disappearance of 13-year-old Hania Aguilar, as the search for the missing North Carolina teen enters its second week.\n\nThe FBI, working in conjunction with police in Lumberton, North Carolina, has released a list of changes that a person might exhibit after committing an abduction.\n\nChief among them are sudden alterations in behavior, missed appointments, being absent from work, or failing to answer calls or text messages.\n\n\u201cThink through the events of the past week, particularly the morning of Monday, Nov. 5, and consider whether you know anything that would help us,\u201d Lumberton Police Chief Michael McNeill said in a press release from the FBI.\n\n\u201cDrastic behavioral changes can help identify the suspect,\u201d the press release said.\n\nFBI supervisor Andy de la Rocha announced on Tuesday that the bureau\u2019s reward for information in the case has increased to $25,000 (it was originally $15,000). The North Carolina governor\u2019s office is offering an additional reward of $5,000, bringing the total to $30,000.\n\nAlthough investigators were notified about a possible sighting of the missing teen this week, the FBI said they have no reason to believe that report is accurate. Authorities also said Hania\u2019s family is fully cooperating and detectives have no reason to think the girl knows her abductor.\n\n\u201cI trust in God that my daughter will return,\u201d Elsa Hern\u00e1ndez said in a statement shared by the FBI. \u201cNo one knows the pain I have in my heart.\u201d\n\nFBI spokeswoman Shelley Lynch expressed disgust Tuesday about criticism that Hern\u00e1ndez received on social media after appearing in a local news report.\n\n\u201cFor people to pick apart how she looks and her reaction, it\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Lynch told reporters.\n\nHania, an eighth-grade student at Lumberton Junior High School, was last seen outside her home at the Rosewood Mobile Home Park in Lumberton just before 7 a.m. on Nov. 5. She was waiting for a ride to school, standing near a relative\u2019s SUV that was parked and idling, when a witness heard a scream and saw someone force the girl into the vehicle and drive off, police said.\n\nThe stolen green Ford Expedition was found abandoned on Nov. 8, less than 10 miles from the mobile home park. Evidence recovered from the vehicle was sent to the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, but police won\u2019t discuss what was found.\n\nAccording to de la Rocha, authorities have received hundreds of tips, conducted dozens of interviews, reviewed hours of surveillance video and \u201cfollowed every conceivable lead.\u201d To date, investigators have found \u201cno evidence\u201d to indicate that Hania is no longer alive, he said.\n\nThe only real clue police have revealed in her disappearance is a surveillance video of an unidentified individual, believed to be a man, walking toward the girl\u2019s residence prior to her disappearance. Police said the person in the footage is not considered a suspect or a person of interest at this time but rather someone they \u201cwant to speak with.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone knows this man, and we need you to call us,\u201d de la Rocha said. \u201cMaybe you recognize the way he walks, his mannerisms, or maybe he will recognize himself on TV.\u201d\n\nAn Amber Alert, disseminated by the North Carolina Center for Missing Persons, describes the missing girl as Hispanic with black hair and brown eyes. She is about 5 feet tall and weighs 125 pounds. She was last seen wearing blue jeans and a blue shirt with flowers.\n\nThe Lumberton Police Department has set up a tip line and is asking anyone with information to call 910-272-5871. Individuals living in the area with surveillance cameras that may have recorded anything of interest are being asked to contact police.

Several contractors complained they were not paid, and a process server for one contractor could not even find Whitaker or his company to serve him with a lawsuit.\n\nAfter being appointed last week by President Donald Trump to the nation\u2019s top law enforcement job, Whitaker\u2019s history as a former federal prosecutor, Republican Party loyalist and critic of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation has come under scrutiny, as have some of his business dealings.\n\nWhitaker is expected to return to his home state Wednesday to speak at a conference at a downtown Des Moines hotel, about two miles from the Ingersoll Avenue apartment building that he once saw as an investment opportunity. After years of rising costs, Whitaker stopped work on the project by early 2016 and sold the building months later.\n\nCity officials raced to see the project completed to avoid losing federal money, and contractors filed liens seeking compensation for more than $32,000 in unpaid work.\n\nA lawyer who represented Whitaker\u2019s company did not return a phone call seeking comment. A Department of Justice spokeswoman said she was looking into the matter.\n\nA company formed by Whitaker and two partners, MEM Investments, was awarded a $166,000 city loan to renovate the vacant three-story complex in 2012, through a Department of Housing and Urban Development grant program to promote affordable housing. A reorganization in 2014 made Whitaker the company\u2019s sole owner.\n\nAll but $25,000 of the loan would be forgiven as long as the project was completed by 2017 and half of its 22 units were restricted to low-income tenants for five years. But what was once thought to be a $400,000 project for lead testing and site improvements became more expensive as additional work and damage piled up, records show.\n\nWhitaker refinanced his mortgage on the building to get more funding and put an undisclosed amount of his own money into the project.\n\nBeginning in February 2015, city officials said they repeatedly communicated the urgency of finishing the project to Whitaker during meetings, letters and phone calls. But by March 2016, an inspection showed \u201cthere had been minimal, if any, additional rehabilitation work completed since the previous inspection\u201d several months earlier, city planner Mary Neiderbach wrote to Whitaker on April 1, 2016.\n\n\u201cIn addition, more damage had occurred to the building\u2019s interior because of what appears to be a roof leak and missing downspouts on the back of the building,\u201d she wrote, adding that Whitaker\u2019s company \u201cappears to have abandoned the property.\u201d\n\nThe letter informed Whitaker that the city was terminating the loan agreement and gave him 30 days to pay back $151,620 that he had been advanced. It noted that the city had to complete the work by the end of 2016 or repay HUD, and that it did not have confidence Whitaker\u2019s company was up to that task.\n\nWhitaker did not reply to the city\u2019s notice. His lender, Lincoln Savings Bank, soon declared Whitaker\u2019s company in default after he ignored demands to pay back a mortgage that had ballooned to $687,000, records show. The bank initiated foreclosure proceedings on the property in July 2016, seeking to be paid back ahead of the city and contractors.\n\nThe contractors included an electrician who filed a lawsuit seeking to collect more than $14,000 in unpaid invoices. A process server said in a court filing that repeated visits to three addresses listed for Whitaker\u2019s company and his law firm turned up nothing other than dark, locked offices. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed after both Whitaker and the contractor failed to show up to a scheduled court hearing that had been announced in the newspaper.\n\nAs part of an exit agreement, Whitaker\u2019s company agreed to sell the building to developer Jeff Young, to \u201cprovide a portion of the Lincoln Savings Bank repayment and to settle all contractor liens against the property,\u201d an August 2016 city memo showed. It\u2019s unclear whether the contractors or the city have been repaid in full.\n\nThe memo said Young was expected to complete the project by the looming December 2016 HUD deadline.\n\nAttorney Jeff Courter, who represented Lincoln Savings Bank, said the matter had been resolved but declined to comment further.", "It was the Wednesday after Election Day, sometime between cleaning up the campaign office and having a final round of beers with her team, that Sarah Willenbrink-Sahin felt the panic set in.\n\n\u201cOh, crap,\u201d she thought. \u201cWhat do I do next?\u201d\n\nSoon, Willenbrink-Sahin, a regional field director for the Ohio Democratic Party who lives near Dayton, was applying for any work she could find: at Costco, as an administrative assistant. Her co-worker, Jake McClelland, made plans to drive for Lyft and return to working at a local bakery. In Minnesota, Jack Dockendorf, who oversaw a competitive state legislative race, prepared to go back to school. Jordan Wolfe, a local organizer, planned to file for unemployment and live off of savings until he found his next job.\n\nThe boom-and-bust nature of campaign life is part of what makes a career in politics so unsustainable for so many. At the end of each midterm election, up to 20,000 people suddenly lose their jobs. The luckiest staff members are hired as congressional aides or legislative assistants. Consultants return to their corporate and advocacy clients. And the rest scramble to figure out what\u2019s next.\n\n\u201cWe struggle during the campaign season, pretty willingly,\u201d Dockendorf said. \u201cBut when the dust settles, it\u2019s: What are we all going to do? It\u2019s something we ought to think about a lot more.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that it helps to have made a living wage. Lucas Benjamin, who worked on a Massachusetts voter initiative, faces what are typical financial burdens for an out-of-work campaigner: a lease he decided to break and looming student debt. But he had the rare fortune, for a campaign worker, to have earned the equivalent of a $51,000 annual salary and has enough savings to weigh his options.\n\nNo good data exist to measure the effect of these boom-and-bust cycles on the efficacy of campaigns themselves. Nearly everyone acknowledges that the job is not sustainable for the workers; it\u2019s why campaign work is so often described as \u201ca young person\u2019s game.\u201d But, over the course of the election, many campaign workers argued that the inability to retain people of talent and experience leads to weaker campaigns. People of color, who tend to lack the safety net of their white peers, say the lack of stability is also part of why campaigns are so homogenous.\n\nStefan Alexander Smith, and the lengths to which he\u2019s gone in order to stay in politics, is a prime example.\n\nSmith landed a dream job when Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign hired him as deputy digital director for the state of Michigan. But despite the doors it opened for him, he almost didn\u2019t last in politics. His unemployment stint after the 2016 elections wiped out most of his savings, so that when he was offered another job, as digital director for the mayor of Boston\u2019s re-election campaign, he couldn\u2019t afford to move. Smith raised money from friends and well-wishers on Facebook. He reluctantly parted with his rent-controlled apartment and sold his beloved station wagon, Bertha.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very much a person you don\u2019t see on campaigns,\u201d he said. He\u2019s lived in public housing, he grew up on food stamps and his family couldn\u2019t help him afford college. \u201cI feel pretty confident in saying I\u2019m probably the poorest person on every campaign I\u2019ve ever worked on.\u201d\n\nOnce he was in Boston, he anticipated his next bout of unemployment by renting an attic from one of the mayor\u2019s political supporters for $500, which he furnished with a crockpot and a fridge from Rent-a-Center. It was only this year that he finally grabbed the brass ring. The Democratic Party of New Mexico, where he\u2019s worked since March, has asked him to stay on through the beginning of 2019.\n\n\u201cThe upfront costs of entering politics is so steep if you don\u2019t have a support system,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI have had to work and worry at every single stage.\u201d\n\nMany campaign professionals would argue there is no fix to this problem \u2014 there simply isn\u2019t a need, in the off-years, for so many political operatives. Nor is it easy to discuss how to make campaign work more sustainable while the campaign is raging. This year, many campaign workers seeking better pay found themselves contending with the notion that their demands would divert money and attention away from Election Day.\n\nThere are also those who are loath to see the instability as a problem at all. Campaigns, this line of thinking goes, can always recruit a new crop of idealistic young people willing to work grueling hours for little pay.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s not as if politics is the only option. Willenbrink-Sahin, who applied to work at Costco, has a master\u2019s and a background in teaching. Smith figures his experience working for a major presidential campaign would make it pretty easy to find work at an ad agency.\n\nPaul Sancya/Associated Press Republican U.S. Senate candidate John James talks with campaign workers at his headquarters in Livonia, Mich.

And like, oh, my God, here he is. Stan Lee is in front of me. So I wandered on over to him.\u201d\n\nMcFarlane says Lee pulled up a chair and he remained there for seven hours while he peppered the comics legend with questions.\n\nMcFarlane eventually joined the Marvel ranks in the late 1980s, illustrating for \u201cIncredible Hulk\u201d and \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man.\u201d By that time, Lee had forgotten the interaction with a 16-year-old baseball-playing nerd, but the memory never left McFarlane. He said the day the Marvel boss treated him \u201clike royalty\u201d remains \u201ccemented\u201d in his brain.\n\n\u201cI see the giant that he is, both from a creative point of view and more so from my perspective,\u201d he says. \u201cJust the way he interacts with fans, and the way he treated people and how he was gracious enough to give me seven hours of time when I was 16. He tried to almost do that same thing but condense it to 30-second bites for every person that was in front of him. His level of energy was really astounding, and I think it\u2019s part of the reason why if he started acting like an old man at the end here, we forgot that he was.\u201d\n\nMark Mainz via Getty Images Stan Lee (right) died Monday; his wife Joan (left) died last year.\n\nLee died on Monday at the age of 95. One month before he passed, McFarlane visited the comics veteran, concerned about recent headlines that alleged financial trouble within Lee\u2019s estate. During the visit, one of Lee\u2019s requests regarding his deceased wife, Joan, struck McFarlane.\n\n\u201cA couple times [during my visit] he would say, \u2018Todd, I just want to go see Joanie,\u2019\u201d McFarlane says. \u201cNear the end a little bit, he [said], \u2018I just want to see Joanie.\u2019 So hopefully \u2015 depending on everybody\u2019s spirituality, whatever people believe \u2015 hopefully he got that wish.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with HuffPost, McFarlane talked about his last visit with Lee, providing some insight into the life of a legend that even his most fervent fans might not know.\n\nSo what was your visit like with Stan a month ago?\n\nI was up at his house every time I came into LA. I tried to as much as possible, if he was awake or at home, to swing by and say \u201chi\u201d just for 10 to 20 minutes. He was great at regaling people with stories. He had a thousand stories. That\u2019s one great thing about having a long life: You get great stories. Even when I was on stage with him, he\u2019d tell this story for everyone, and I was deeply entertained. When we were in the car together, he\u2019d tell stories. And then I\u2019d go to his house, it\u2019d be a private setting, and he\u2019d tell stories.\n\nThe last time I went to see him, I could tell the tables got turned a little bit. I could see he was tired. The energy wasn\u2019t there, so I said, \u201cHey, Stan, you know what, you\u2019re always telling me stories. Let me tell you a bunch of crazy stories about my life and my wife and my career a little bit, and I can sort of lighten your load here for an hour.\u201d One thing that\u2019s not attractive about turning 95 is the body has a tendency to betray you a little bit. His eyesight was getting really bad and his hearing, so it was a frustration to him, especially with the loss of his wife a year earlier. \u201cI can\u2019t enjoy life. I can\u2019t even see it. And, oh, by the way, even if I want to enjoy it, my wife isn\u2019t here anymore.\u201d But I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s not a whole unique thing for people who get to live as long as he does.\n\nI also know people who think that what he did was a shtick. Because it was so high energy, you go, ah, he just puts on this sort of act here. I would get off the airplane sometimes and he\u2019d meet me and we\u2019d share the cab ride where we were going, and he\u2019d just go \u2014 I\u2019ve got recordings of him \u2014 just poking fun and telling jokes [with] me being the butt of his stories. Like, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re here. I\u2019m the more handsome of the two. This is gonna be such a terrible panel with you on it,\u201d and blah blah blah. Some of it I\u2019d heard before, but like I said, I marvel. I\u2019ve got a father who still has a lot of energy, so I marvel at people who still see the glass of the world as half-full.\n\nWith the headlines that we\u2019ve seen about his estate, what was it like visiting him?\n\nBesides being a dear friend, the other agenda was to just make sure that this elderly man was good, right? My father\u2019s still alive, so I was probably projecting because, again, you\u2019re in the business here. You read all the stories. Where does fact and fiction start? I was in the middle of all that, so maybe someday I\u2019ll tell my story, but I just go, I gotta keep going to see to make sure when different people were around him that he was at least being treated with the reverence that a 90-year-old man should have. Just common decency. I just was hoping he was comfortable with common decency. That\u2019s all.\n\nAll the rest of it, that he was Stan Lee and all the other stuff, was a little secondary to me. I wish it wasn\u2019t there. I wish he would\u2019ve gone out going, \u201cI had a beautiful wife of 70 years and I left on top.\u201d And there wasn\u2019t this little cloud that had spun around him for the last year or so. But Todd only rhymes with God.\n\nWhat\u2019s it like looking back on his legacy?\n\nIn comic books, he\u2019s at the top. He\u2019s at the top for two reasons. You can go vertical, and the vertical is how many characters and ideas you created, and then you start stacking them on top of each other. So he created this giant column of hype that some of us will just pretend to go to our grave having done a fraction of what he did. That in and of itself is almost unparalleled. Then you start going horizontal, and the spread of those characters globally \u2015 especially in the last 10 to 20 years with the movies that he created, this vast array of characters \u2015 they got spread across an entire planet. Who does that?\n\nYou start getting into those categories, you start counting those creative people on fingers that have that kind of impact. I\u2019m talking about in every country in the world. From a strictly creative point of view, the only other one I can think of remotely in that category is Walt Disney. He built an empire, too, and spread it across the nation. I have to believe the goal of any creative person is you create something that will ultimately outlive you, which means it was relevant and important to enough people\u2019s lives. Disney did it, and we\u2019re now decades past his passing. Obviously, we\u2019re going to see that Stan Lee had a giant impact just like that, if not grander.\n\nWhat\u2019s something fans might not realize about Stan Lee or fully appreciate?\n\nIn talking to him, that he was just as nervous about his creations and whether his ideas were good enough as all the rest of us. All those same doubts that permeate any amateur or any professional person that just goes, \u201cAm I doing it, right?\u201d We now have hindsight to say they did and it worked, but when he was talking to me about when he was creating those \u2015 he didn\u2019t know that he was about to unleash some unparalleled creativity in front of us. He thought some of it might fail miserably. I think it\u2019s a lesson to be taught to everybody that even the greats don\u2019t know when they\u2019re being great. He was just as fallible at the beginning of all this as we were, and he\u2019d be the first to admit that he had a lot of good luck on his side and things sort of went his way. I\u2019m sure if he could\u2019ve waved a wand and shared it with a lot of people he would\u2019ve.\n\n@ToddMcFarlane Lee telling stories.\n\nWere there characters he thought weren\u2019t going to pan out? Like, did he ever say, \u201cI didn\u2019t know about Spider-Man.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s take Spider-Man. Spider-Man went into a comic book called \u201cAmazing Fantasy,\u201d and the reason was because they were basically going to get rid of the book. Because it was floundering. So they said, \u201cHey, come up with something and maybe the book might rebound or we could keep it going for a couple more months.\u201d Maybe he\u2019d been thinking about it for a long time. Maybe he goes, \u201cHey, cool name.\u201d\n\nBut it could\u2019ve easily been the last issue of \u201cAmazing Fantasy,\u201d and that was the end of that character. But with Jack Kirby showing this cool costume, and later Steve Ditko giving us the artwork, it ends up having the opposite effect. Oh, my gosh, we can\u2019t cancel this book. We\u2019re going to have to keep this character going, but ... let\u2019s turn the book from \u201cAmazing Fantasy\u201d into \u201cAmazing Spider-Man.\u201d And from there, given that \u201cFantastic Four\u201d had just come out, that basically was the foundation Marvel was built on \u2015 those two early ideas.\n\nWow, that is amazing.\n\nI don\u2019t think people sort of understand the history of what was happening with comic books. We were coming from the war zone Senate hearings of, \u201cComic books were bad for society.\u201d He was tasked with trying to come up with something that was more pure Americana, if you will. The Comics Code [Authority] comes in, so he was trying to do a little more lighthearted stuff, which is why Peter Parker is a little goofy. Even the Thing ... he played with a lot of levity in it.\n\nHe also knew that when you got those components that you have to have a big opposing villain to have the hero seem that much more inspiring. When you talk to him about it, it\u2019s almost like an architect telling you how he\u2019s going to put a building together. Then you hope that it holds in the bad weather. He just kept pumping them out and he kept doing it.\n\nI asked him before ... there\u2019s a reason why a lot of his characters have names that start with the first and last letter: Peter Parker, Doc Doom, Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Bruce Banner. Part of it was he was doing so much work and his memory wasn\u2019t that good. He said back then that, \u201cIt\u2019s like I had to find a cheat to remember all these characters. I was creating at such a fast pace.\u201d When he was in the middle of it, he would go, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to stick here. So I have to figure out these shortcuts in the creative process so that it all sort of works. I hope that some of it sticks.\u201d And the vast majority of it did.", "Till tech do us part?\n\nA Japanese man had the wedding of his dreams to a woman who doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nEarlier this month, 35-year-old Akihiko Kondo got hitched to Hatsune Miku, a singing hologram that uses a voice synthesizer to perform in sold-out shows worldwide, according to \u201cInside Edition.\u201d\n\nDespite her fame, Kondo\u2019s family didn\u2019t approve of her.\n\n\u201cFor mother, it wasn\u2019t something to celebrate,\u201d Kondo told the Japan Times. Not one family member was among the 40 guests who attended the ceremony, which was estimated to cost $18,000.\n\nOf course, Miku, being just a virtual creation, wasn\u2019t actually there either, except in the form of a stuffed toy.\n\nBEHROUZ MEHRI via Getty Images Groom Akihiko Kondo, 35, with a Hatsune Miku stuffed doll at the wedding.\n\nKondo insists his love is as true blue as the color of Miku\u2019s fake hair.\n\n\u201cI never cheated on her; I\u2019ve always been in love with Miku-san,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about her every day.\u201d\n\nMiku doesn\u2019t exactly live with Kondo either \u2015 except as a talking hologram floating in a $2,800 desktop device in his Tokyo home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in love with the whole concept of Hatsune Miku, but I got married to the Miku of my house,\u201d he said.\n\nIt should be noted that the marriage isn\u2019t legally binding in any aspect. Also, TheGamer.com notes that Gatebox, the company that created Miku, is not expecting the virtual vixen to remain monogamous.\n\nThe company has already issued more than 3,700 marriage certificates to people who want to wed a hologram.\n\nAlthough Kondo\u2019s parents are holding out hope he might settle down with a human, not a hologram, he told the Japan Times that\u2019s not going to happen.", "\u201cExcelsior\u201d in Latin translates to \u201cever upward,\u201d and it\u2019s the word that became the catchphrase of Marvel Editor-in-Chief and Chairman Stan Lee in the 1960s. He used it as the sign-off for his monthly column Stan\u2019s Soapbox, where he would discuss his opinions on everything from the Vietnam War to his progressive views on race in America.\n\n\u201cExcelsior!\u201d was a fitting catchphrase for our now-fallen hero, who passed away on Monday at 95, because he helped change the lives and raise the hopes of so many members of the world\u2019s most marginalized communities and move them \u201cever upward.\u201d\n\nLee saw the importance of using the Marvel Universe to shed light on issues plaguing marginalized communities. So he created a universe with stories that would be an allegory for the racial strife in America.\n\nHe also created superheroes that strayed from the convention of straight white males, characters that could help represent these underrepresented communities in a positive light that celebrated their cultures and differences. Of these characters and storylines, two of the most famous are the X-Men and Black Panther.\n\nLee\u2019s work laid the foundation for a universe where anyone could be a hero, regardless of race, color, gender, or any difference.\n\nInspired by the civil rights movement in America, Lee and Jack Kirby created the X-Men comic universe, a world in which some people, known as mutants, were born with a gene that gave them special abilities but also often made them look different than typical humans.\n\nBecause of this, mutants were often persecuted, oppressed and even killed for being different. Rather than fighting foes from outer space and stopping crimes, the X-Men focused on fighting the daily oppression mutants faced at the hands of society and the government.\n\nLee and Kirby also found inspiration and an opportunity to broaden public understanding of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. It\u2019s long been rumored that Lee based the characters of Charles Xavier, aka Professor X, and Erik Lehnserr, aka Magneto, on the two icons.\n\nDr. King is said to have inspired Professor X\u2019s character, while Malcolm inspired Magneto\u2019s. Both men wanted liberation for their people, but each had a different ideology as to how liberation could and should be accomplished. Professor X, like Dr. King, chose a nonviolent route, while Magneto took more of a proactive stance in fighting against the prejudices and oppression plaguing their people.\n\nThe creation of the X-Men comic didn\u2019t just help show the perils that many groups were facing in America. It also helped many people feel that for the first time, the world of comics included them. Thus, a new community of Black nerds was finally able to read about characters who felt and looked like them.\n\nFirstpost\n\nStan and Kirby also created the Black Panther comic, which helped people reimagine their ideas about Blackness, royalty, intellect, wealth and Black women. They were intentional about creating a world, the never-colonized fictional country of Wakanda, that was authentic but also aspirational.\n\nWakanda is the wealthiest and most technologically advanced country in the world, populated only by Wakandans, the beautiful Black people. The king of the country, who also wears the mantle of superhero, Black Panther, protects Wakanda. The king can be a man or woman and is always not only powerful, but also intelligent and deeply caring. Each king has a dedicated force of elite soldiers called the Dora Milaje, an all-female guard comprising the most skilled warriors on the planet.\n\nWakanda and its characters are meant to starkly contrast with negative stereotypes about not only African nations but also Black people.\n\nThe X-Men and Black Panther comics helped to create a safe and inclusive space for fans who were dealing with the same type of oppression they were reading about. Which is seemingly exactly what Lee wanted: A place where anyone could feel accepted, understood, and seen. To do that, he created characters who showed the world that people who aren\u2019t straight white males can be superheroes, too.\n\nLee had dreams that he thought everyone should share with him. From the queer Latina America Chavez to the Kenyan weather goddess Storm, Lee\u2019s work laid the foundation for a universe where anyone could be a hero, regardless of race, color, gender, or any other difference. A place where morality and human (or inhuman) decency determined how people were treated.\n\nIn a video released by Marvel Entertainment last year, Lee addressed his fans by saying the following:\n\n\u201cMarvel has always been and always will be a reflection of the world right outside our window. That world may change and evolve, but the one thing that will never change is the way we tell our stories about heroism. Those stories have room for everyone, regardless of their race, gender, religion or color of their skin. The only things we don\u2019t have room for are hatred, intolerance and bigotry ... We\u2019re all part of one big family ... and we all come together in the body of Marvel. You\u2019re part of the Marvel universe that moves ever upward and onward to greater glory ... Excelsior!\u201d\n\nLee created worlds in which Black people \u2015 all people \u2015 could see their humanity and magic realized. In losing Stan Lee, our world has lost one of the last superheroes.", "One Donald Trump supporter wanted to make a big splash at Disney World.\n\nIt worked \u2015 sorta \u2015 except now he\u2019s been permanently banned from all Disney properties.\n\nEarlier this month, Dion Cini rode down Splash Mountain at Walt Disney World holding a \u201cTrump 2020\u201d sign above his head. Then he held up a \u201cKeep America Great\u201d sign on Expedition Everest, according to the Orlando Sentinel.\n\nBut Cini wasn\u2019t a first time offender. About seven weeks ago, the New Yorker was banned from the park after he unfurled a giant Trump banner at the Main Street train station.\n\nDisney\u2019s park rules state that \u201cthe usage of any flag, banner or sign to incite a crowd\u201d is prohibited, but park officials decided to give him a second chance, provided he no longer display any more banners or flags.\n\nBut Cini just couldn\u2019t help himself, apparently.\n\n\u201cAnd I wanted to actually abide by their rules, and not hold up a flag to incite a crowd, but I kind of wanted to test them,\u201d he told local station WFTV. \u201cI just really wanted to find out whether or not it had to do with unfurling a flag, or what was written on the flag.\u201d\n\nHe also claims that park officials weren\u2019t clear about what he could and couldn\u2019t do.\n\n\u201cThey never mentioned the fact that there was some kind of safety issue on the ride. That I was holding up a sign and I shouldn\u2019t be doing that,\u201d he told the station.\n\nCini says that he won\u2019t break the law though, which means he won\u2019t be going back to Walt Disney World, even though he\u2019s held an annual pass for nearly two decades.\n\nHowever, Cini does plan to continue to fly Trump 2020 banners around the country and promises the banners will get even bigger, according to WOFL TV.", "Stacey Abrams, who has refused to concede her gubernatorial race in Georgia against the state\u2019s Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp, has had little recourse to address her concerns that Kemp used his role as Georgia\u2019s chief election official to aid his campaign by making it harder for black people to vote. President Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department has demonstrated little to no interest in investigating or upholding voting and civil rights laws. Republicans in Congress have shown no interest in standing up for voting rights. And Trump and congressional Republicans spent the past two years attempting to justify laws that make it harder to vote by investigating baseless claims of widespread voter fraud.\n\nBut now that Democrats won control of the House of Representatives, that\u2019s all about to change. Power will shift from a nearly all-white political party that refuses to support a reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act to a multiracial political party that announced its first act of 2019 will be to pass legislation greatly expanding voting rights. Key Democrats are giving signs that they will investigate voter suppression in the 2018 elections.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has refused to concede the election until all the votes are counted.\n\n\u201cVoting rights will return to being a high priority for Congress in the session that gets under way in January, and particular attention will be given to widespread allegations of vote suppression in places like Georgia, Tennessee, North Dakota and elsewhere,\u201d Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), the ranking member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, said in a statement to HuffPost. \u201cI expect the Judiciary Committee will want to hold early hearings. Voting rights are a cornerstone of our democracy and we can\u2019t permit them to be eroded.\u201d\n\nCohen is the likely next chairman of his subcommittee, which is the first layer of oversight in the House for federal voting and civil rights issues. If he takes that gavel, he will replace current chairman Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), an outspoken white supremacist who used the committee to support voter suppression laws.\n\nThere are a number of potential lines of investigation into alleged voter suppression for Democrats when they take control of the House in January.\n\nThe election in Georgia will be at the top of the list, as Kemp used his official position to help his campaign by purging voter rolls and reducing voting access in African-American communities. There is no shortage of problems that emerged from this election. In a highly aggressive attempt to clean up the voter rolls, Kemp\u2019s office removed 1.5 million registered voters\u2019 names from those rolls. He also instituted an exact match system that canceled voter registrations that did not have the exact same spelling for names as they appear in other government databases. That system kept 53,000 voters, 70 percent of them African-American, from being able to register, according to the Associated Press. Kemp\u2019s office closed over 200 polling places since 2012 and wanted to close more, especially ones in heavily African-American neighborhoods, but was prevented by a court order. Newly combined polling locations did not receive extra voting machines for Election Day, leading to waits of more than four hours at some sites.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Waits to vote in some Georgia precincts exceeded four hours this year.\n\nDemocrats in the House and Senate previously asked the Justice Department to investigate what was happening in Georgia. The Congressional Black Caucus sent a letter in October to then\u2013Attorney General Jeff Sessions calling on the department to investigate Kemp\u2019s exact match policy and the closure of voting locations in predominantly African-American locations. After the elections, Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) sent a letter asking the department to investigate whether the state\u2019s election changes violated the Voting Rights Act.\n\nIn North Dakota, Native American activists sued the state over its voter ID law, claiming that it discriminated against tribal communities that lack street addresses. A judge rejected the lawsuit before voting began, but did so by stating the suit came too close to the election. A committee investigation could help highlight the problems that Native Americans face from voter ID and other restrictive voting laws.\n\nOther questions about voter suppression emerged in Missouri, where a court tossed part of the state\u2019s controversial voter ID law just before the election, and in Tennessee, where the NAACP and the Tennessee Black Voter Project sued over allegedly improperly invalidated voter registrations, mostly in heavily African-American counties.", "The protesters chanted \u201cCount every vote!\u201d during the demonstration and \u201cLet her go!\u201d as Williams was being arrested, WSB-TV reported.

Prolonged drought and increasingly warm conditions are leading to hotter, faster-burning fires that occur more and more often.\n\nWith that in mind, here\u2019s how to prepare for a wildfire:\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Homes destroyed by a wildfire in the Mary Lake Subdivision of Redding, California, seen on Aug. 10, 2018.\n\nWhat To Do Ahead Of Time\n\nClear undergrowth, dead branches, leaves, log piles and anything else combustible away from your house. This is known as creating a \u201cdefensible space\u201d \u2015 it helps defend your home by acting as a break against encroaching flames. The Federal Emergency Management Agency recommends maintaining a clear swath of at least 30 feet on all sides of the house, but the larger this area, the better. For more information on how to \u201charden\u201d your home in advance of a wildfire, Marin County, California, has a long list of suggestions.\n\nDon\u2019t give embers that reach the house any more fuel than is naturally available. Keep your roof and gutters clean.\n\nBuy N95 (or higher) rated respirators for yourself and members of your family. If you\u2019re close enough to a fire that air quality is impacted, these masks will at least help filter out ash and other fine particulate so you don\u2019t inhale it. If anyone in your family has asthma or another respiratory ailment, make sure their supply of medication is adequate as well.\n\nIs your insurance sufficient? Check your policy, and consider adding flood insurance, which is often an issue after a wildfire. In addition to your home, make sure your car is covered against fire damage \u2015 it\u2019s often a separate option. If you have a business that could burn or be otherwise negatively impacted, consider coverage for lost income. Read more on that, and how to file a claim should the worst happen, here.\n\nStore important documents in a fire-resistant safe or another secure place. Back up important digital documents with password-protected copies, ideally stored on the cloud. In a pinch, a thumb drive stored in that physical safe place is better than nothing. Here\u2019s a list of documents to consider for safekeeping.\n\nFigure out where to check for emergency alerts. In the event of a fire, knowing when to evacuate and what route to take can literally be life-saving information. In addition to the Emergency Alert System on radio, television and cell phones, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Weather Radio, check with your county and see if you can sign up for specific alerts via platforms like CodeRED and Everbridge.\n\nSort through your possessions and decide what valuables and important documents to take with you if you have to evacuate. Be prepared to move them to your car very quickly.\n\nPack a go bag with water, food, a first aid kit and respirators that you can grab in case of an emergency.\n\nIf you anticipate needing to evacuate in the near future, ask friends and family outside the threatened area if you can stay with them temporarily. Figure out ahead of time what to do with your pets; the Red Cross has a guide for that here.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A truck drives next to the Delta fire along Interstate 5 near Shasta-Trinity National Forest, California, on Sept. 5, 2018.\n\nSo You\u2019ve Been Ordered To Evacuate\n\nDo it. Every year some people live through hurricanes or other natural disasters by stocking up on necessities and staying put even when ordered to evacuate. But a wildfire is never something you should plan to face head-on. If you\u2019re instructed to leave, leave.\n\nMove your valuables to your car, along with important documents and that go bag.\n\nCheck your route and where you\u2019re evacuating to. The Red Cross maintains a map of open shelters here. Service animals that assist people with disabilities are allowed in shelters; pets are generally not.\n\nIf your home is fueled by an external propane tank, turn off the supply valve on the tank outside. For metered natural gas provided by a utility, leave the system alone unless your gas company tells you to do otherwise.\n\nIf you find yourself trapped by the fire, call 911 and tell them your location.

Republican leaders in the House of Representatives moved on Nov. 13 to quash a bill that would end U.S. support for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 Republican leadership in the House of Representatives moved Tuesday evening to quash a bill that would end U.S. support for the brutal Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.\n\nComing on the first day of a lame-duck session \u2014 the GOP\u2019s final few weeks controlling the lower chamber \u2014 the bid surprised anti-war advocates and top Democrats who have been rallying opposition to the controversial Yemen war for months and made clear they wanted a serious debate on the matter soon after the midterms. Many involved in the fight became aware of the Republican gambit only earlier in the day. (HuffPost was the first to report that it would take place, citing a Democratic aide and an activist in touch with multiple Capitol Hill offices.)\n\nSoon after meeting at 5 p.m. Eastern time, the GOP-controlled House Rules Committee adopted a rule stripping privileged status from the Yemen bill. The full House will now consider that rule Wednesday afternoon, and the Republicans\u2019 plan is to hold their caucus together to pass it along party lines.\n\nIf a majority of lawmakers vote to remove the privilege, the legislation will become just another proposal that House leadership is not required to bring up for debate. That strategy would save lawmakers from having to vote either to keep assisting in the bombing of civilians or to anger an American ally and President Donald Trump, who has grown close to the Saudis.\n\nThe Republican establishment torpedoed a previous version of the bill \u2014 which argues that the U.S. assistance is illegal because Congress never voted on it \u2014 last November through similar Rules Committee maneuvering. But the move on Tuesday was striking because conditions in Yemen have grown far more dire, anger in Congress toward Saudi Arabia has spiked since the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Republicans\u2019 claim to represent what Americans want is far weaker after the Nov. 6 elections.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), other sympathetic legislators like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and human rights groups have pushed hard over the past year to try the fight again and hold the vote. In recent months, they have gained the public support of the Democratic future chairmen of the most important House panels dealing with foreign policy \u2015 Reps. Adam Smith (Wash.) and Eliot Engel (N.Y.) \u2015 and party leaders like Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (Md.).\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations has repeatedly called the situation in Yemen the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, and aid groups have issued increasingly urgent warnings over the past two months that more than 14 million people are on the brink of famine.\n\nEven the Trump administration has started to hint at a rollback of support by saying it plans to end aerial refueling by American planes of bombers belonging to the Saudis and their ally the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), pointed to that change as evidence Washington is already changing course on the war and there\u2019s no need for further House debate. \u201cThe U.S. is no longer providing the very support that this bill seeks to cut off thus making it unnecessary,\u201d she wrote in an email Tuesday evening. \u201cWe negotiated a compromise resolution with this same sponsor [last year] and passed that resolution. The House has spoken on this issue.\u201d\n\nStrong\u2019s comment also repeated the Republican argument that the War Powers Act, the legal basis for the Yemen bill, does not apply here since U.S. forces are not actually doing the bombing and ground fighting. Backed by the Trump administration, particularly the Pentagon, GOP lawmakers have for years used that line to tightly limit discussion of the American role in the war. Now they\u2019re combining that long-standing argument with the new point that since the refueling operation is finished, the Yemen bill has no purpose.\n\nBut the fighting is now getting worse in densely populated parts of Yemen \u2015 and American weapons, intelligence and international diplomatic support remain central to the campaign. Analysts saw Trump\u2019s refueling decision and recent pressure on the Saudis to support peace talks as a strategy to stop lawmakers from moving in a tougher way than he would like.\n\nCritics of the war told HuffPost the GOP move is disappointing but not debilitating. They plan to lobby Republicans before Wednesday\u2019s vote by directly criticizing Ryan and others for providing cover for a campaign accused of war crimes, and they note that whatever happens, similar legislation will come up soon in the Senate and could be considered after Democrats take control of the House in January.", "Melania Trump on Tuesday called for the firing of deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel amid reports that President Donald Trump may be weighing several more major shakeups to his administration.\n\n\u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\u201d a spokesperson for FLOTUS said of Ricardel in a comment to ABC.\n\nThe remark is uncharacteristically harsh for the first lady, but there\u2019s a backstory. Read on to find out more about what\u2019s going on.\n\nWho is Mira Ricardel?\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters John Bolton named Mira Ricardel as his deputy in April.\n\nRicardel is the deputy to national security adviser John Bolton. She is a longtime GOP official who previously served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, as well as the office of former Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican presidential nominee in 1996.\n\nWhy does the first lady have an issue with her?\n\nMelania Trump\u2019s beef with Ricardel stems from the first lady\u2019s trip to Africa last month when her staff clashed with the adviser over things like plane seating and requests to use National Security Council resources, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe first lady has also suspected Ricardel of being behind several negative press stories about her. She reportedly discussed the issue with the president during their recent trip to Paris, during which Trump told his wife he would have Ricardel removed.\n\nThe first lady isn\u2019t the only one who has clashed with Ricardel. The adviser also butted heads with Fred Fleitz, former chief of staff and executive secretary for the National Security Council, as well as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other Pentagon officials.\n\nHow does all this relate to chief of staff John Kelly?\n\nKelly has apparently also drawn the first lady\u2019s scorn over travel requests and reportedly denied her repeated requests to promote several aides.\n\n\u201cThere have been instances where the East Wing staff were not treated as equals to the male-dominated decision makers in Chief Kelly\u2019s office,\u201d one unnamed White House official told NBC. \u201cPromotions were denied then finally granted after months of requests.\u201d\n\nTASOS KATOPODIS via Getty Images Kelly has reportedly clashed with the first lady over staffing issues.\n\nIs Kelly\u2019s job in trouble, too?\n\nTrump is reportedly considering firing Kelly, along with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, according to multiple reports this week. In addition to the first lady, Kelly has reportedly also clashed with both Bolton and Ricardel and has been seeking to get Ricardel fired for weeks. Bolton, meanwhile, has reportedly been pushing for Nielsen\u2019s firing.\n\nThe president has not officially announced any of these terminations. But on Tuesday, he told reporters, \u201cWe\u2019ll be talking about it.\u201d", "New Yorkers, take note: While you commute in dilapidated and decaying subways, know that Jeff Bezos will be able to rely on a more upscale mode of transit to get to Amazon\u2019s forthcoming New York City headquarters in Queens.\n\nThat\u2019s because New Yorkers are buying a helipad for Bezos, the richest man in the world.\n\nBuried in the 32-page, $1.5 billion agreement between New York\u2019s various economic development agencies and Amazon is a promise by the city to help the company secure rights to a helipad on, \u201cor in reasonable proximity to,\u201d the company\u2019s new site in Long Island City.\n\n(Amazon\u2019s other recently announced headquarters, in Virginia, also includes a clause for a helipad).\n\nFor its part, Amazon agreed to limit landings on the pad to no more than 120 a year, restrict it to \u201ccorporate use\u201d only and agree to fly \u201cexclusively over water or the Development Sites.\u201d", "A Florida church will no longer serve as a polling location after its pastor put up a sign on Election Day that suggested Christians shouldn\u2019t vote for Democrats.\n\nPasco County Supervisor of Elections Brian Corley told HuffPost that he received hundreds of complaints on Nov. 6 about the controversial sign at New Port Richey\u2019s Grace of God Church.\n\nThe sign, handwritten in marker on white paper, read, \u201cDon\u2019t vote for Democrats on Tuesday and sing, \u2018Oh how I love Jesus\u2019 on Sunday.\u201d\n\nCorley said the church\u2019s senior pastor, Al Carlisle, put up the sign and refused the supervisor\u2019s requests to take it down.\n\nCorley said it\u2019s \u201cnot unlawful\u201d but highly \u201cinappropriate\u201d for a polling place to display prominent political signage to \u201cinstigate voters\u201d in a particular precinct.

There is a line drawn in the sand by Jesus that we ought not cross.\u201d\n\nThe pastor posted a photo of the sign on his Facebook profile the morning of Nov. 6, along with a caption reading, \u201cMy sign at our church\u2019s polling site.\u201d\n\nLater that day, he shared an image of a quote on his Facebook page that read, \u201cIf you\u2019re a Christian, you cannot vote for a person or party that slays babies in the womb,\u201d commenting that this was \u201cbasically what I said too.\u201d\n\nHe told the Tampa Bay Times that he takes issue with progressive stances on abortion rights and on supporting the LGBTQ community.

Over the past few years, several Christian denominations and individual churches have become more affirming of queer love and identity. LGBTQ Christians have long served as lay leaders, ministers and bishops of churches.\n\nMany Christians \u2015 including some evangelicals \u2015 also express strong support for immigrants and refugees.\n\nChristians of color tend to swing more progressive than their co-religionists on issues of race and immigration.\n\nCorley said he was unable to remove the sign on Election Day because it was on private property, outside the 100-foot perimeter around polling places, inside of which Florida prohibits electioneering. He added that there are no laws barring polling locations in Florida from campaigning on Election Day.\n\nStill, Corley said, the sign was \u201ccompletely unnecessary, unwarranted and inappropriate.\u201d He added that complaints about the sign clogged up his office\u2019s phone lines on a day when his staff was trying to focus on other issues voters were having at the polls.\n\nCorley told HuffPost that changing the polling location for this neighborhood will cost several thousand taxpayer dollars, since his staff will have to devote time to locating a new building and notifying voters of the change.\n\nBut Corley said he believes it\u2019s not fair to his constituents to continue using Grace of God Church.", "Tardiness pumps Kerry Washington up.\n\nThe \u201cScandal\u201d actress revealed to \u201cLate Night\u201d host Seth Meyers on Monday that when she\u2019s late, the director of \u201cAmerican Son,\u201d the Broadway play in which she\u2019s starring, makes her do pushups.\n\nAnd she\u2019s not alone.

She modernized the organization and attracted a new generation to the reproductive rights movement with a period tracker app, a new brand, look and logo, and the award-winning virtual reality film \u201cAcross the Line\u201d about the personal experience of getting access to abortion. She developed the group\u2019s powerful political advocacy arm, the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and built partnerships with other progressive organizations. Since 2010, she has helped fend off 21 attempts by Congress to defund the health care provider.\n\n\u201cDawn must feel good and should feel good about the last week\u2019s elections,\u201d Richards told HuffPost, referring to the Democrats\u2019 takeover of the House of Representatives, \u201cbecause she had a huge role to play.\u201d\n\nLaguens remembers well the day that Richards recruited her: It was Christmas Day in 2010. President Barack Obama had just passed his signature health care bill, Republicans had swept the House of Representatives in the midterms, and then-Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.) had decided to use his party\u2019s new majority to take aim at Planned Parenthood.\n\nPence introduced an amendment that would strip federal funds from Planned Parenthood, kicking off a Republican war against the family planning provider that has lasted eight years. Richards, the iconic face of Planned Parenthood, needed help with her first big battle against Congress. She called her friend Dawn Laguens from an airport on Dec. 25.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the day,\u201d Laguens said. \u201cWhen the phone rang, I thought, \u2018Oh, how nice that is of Cecile, to be giving me Christmas greetings on Christmas Day!\u2019\u201d\n\nRichards sounded urgent. \u201cI\u2019m on my way to Egypt,\u201d she said, \u201cbut when I get back, I need you to come in and help put together the fight against the Pence Amendment.\u201d\n\nDawn Laguens (right), outgoing vice president of Planned Parenthood, and former President Cecile Richards are seen in an undated photo.\n\nLaguens, who owned her own political consulting firm at the time, stepped in to help Planned Parenthood as Republicans threatened a government shutdown over its funding. She won that first battle and then couldn\u2019t bring herself to leave. \u201cI fell in love with the people, more than anything, and the mission, more deeply,\u201d she said. \u201cI stayed about seven and a half years longer than I ever planned.\u201d\n\nAs executive vice president, chief brand officer and chief experience officer, Laguens has helped lead the nation\u2019s largest family planning provider through a tumultuous time in its 100-year history. In addition to fending off dozens of defunding efforts from Congress and the states, Planned Parenthood has had to brawl with outside groups \u2015 sometimes unexpected ones.\n\nIn 2012, the charity Susan G. Komen for the Cure tried to pull breast cancer grants from Planned Parenthood because one of its executives, Karen Handel, opposed abortion rights. But Planned Parenthood immediately mobilized its supporters, and the backlash against Komen was so strong that the charity quickly apologized, forced Handel and other officials to resign and reinstated the grants.\n\nIn 2015, an anti-abortion activist group called the Center for Medical Progress hit Planned Parenthood with a series of heavily doctored undercover \u201csting\u201d videos that purported to show the provider trafficking fetal body parts. Those videos were debunked \u2015 but they gave Republicans in Congress a pretext to open a federal investigation into Planned Parenthood and attack its funding again. (The investigation turned up nothing.)\n\nLaguens has partnered with other progressive organizations, including the National Women\u2019s Law Center, to help implement the birth control benefit in the Affordable Care Act. She also grew Planned Parenthood\u2019s c4 electoral program to be one of the largest and most effective in the country, and built an innovative strategy to attack the stigma around abortion.\n\nRichards said she stepped down from the helm of the organization after a decade in part because she felt confident in Laguens.\n\n\u201cI think one of the reasons why I felt like I was able to step aside was that such a strong foundation has been laid, a real movement has been built,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I hope she\u2019s proud of that and the difference it made in the lives of millions of people.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood is entering a new era now. Dr. Leana Wen, its new president, has a plan to depoliticize abortion and incorporate it in the public imagination with all other kinds of basic women\u2019s health care. Laguens plans to take some time off to spend with her family \u2015 her partner and their triplet daughters. She hasn\u2019t figured out her next career move yet, but she wants to continue to innovate within the reproductive rights movement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve won these elections, and it\u2019s a great moment to make a switch and think about how I can tackle some of these challenges that new technologies can be applied to,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll stay close to the fight \u2015 I can\u2019t imagine that I will go far away from it. It\u2019s close to my heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cDawn pushes the boundaries of what nonprofits can achieve when they don\u2019t wait for secondhand technology,\u201d said documentary filmmater Nonny de la Pe\u00f1a, who worked with Laguens on \u201cAcross the Line.\u201d \u201cHer idea to use the immersive but very new technology of virtual reality to challenge the stigma surrounding abortion was fairly radical. It worked, and it inspired many creators to use technology to solve big problems in social justice movements.\u201d\n\nLaguens is leaving Planned Parenthood in a fairly safe place, with a Democratic House of Representatives expected to protect it. She said her proudest memory of her experience at the family planning provider is the group\u2019s undefeated 21-win streak against Republicans in Congress, who promise and try every year to defund them.", "Bloomberg via Getty Images Trucks lined up at a demonstration in Washington in October.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency announced a new effort to slash pollution from heavy-duty trucks, surprising critics who say the move is the Trump administration\u2019s first to increase regulations on emitters.\n\nFlanked by the heads of trucking industry associations, Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the push, dubbed the \u201cClean Trucks Initiative,\u201d will include a rule to toughen standards on nitrogen oxides, the emissions that cause asthma-triggering smog.\n\n\u201cWe are under no regulatory or court-ordered requirements to launch this initiative,\u201d Wheeler said on an embargoed call with reporters Monday night \u2015 remarks he echoed in Washington on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cWe are doing it because it\u2019s good for the environment.\u201d\n\nDetails are hazy on the plan, which is expected to include eliminating other trucking regulations the EPA deems onerous to lowering emissions. At the press conference, Wheeler touted the EPA\u2019s efforts to gut regulations that cost industry players a combined $1.6 billion, and said he planned to propose 49 additional \u201cderegulatory actions estimated to provide up to $100 billion in savings.\u201d\n\nStill, environmentalists hailed the announcement as the administration\u2019s first concrete move to ramp up rules on a heavily-polluting industry.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Andrew Wheeler, the acting administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, greets President Donald Trump on stage.\n\n\u201cIt looks as if Team Trump will make it one in a row for the environment,\u201d said Daniel Becker, the director of the Washington-based Safe Climate Campaign\u2019s Center for Auto Safety. \u201cOr as the French say, even the blind pig sometimes finds the truffle!\u201d\n\nThe industry itself rallied behind the announcement. On Tuesday, the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association called the initiative \u201ca tremendous opportunity.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe \u2013 EPA and the manufacturers \u2013 have done this before, and we\u2019re ready to step forward to do it again,\u201d Jed Mandel, the trade group\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cWe ask the Agency to follow that same successful roadmap by leading a collaborative, open regulatory process involving all stakeholders.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes three months after the administration proposed dramatically weakening fuel economy standards, clearing the way for vehicles \u2015 the nation\u2019s top source of climate pollution \u2015 to emit an addition 600 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to Canada\u2019s entire annual emissions, by 2030. On Monday\u2019s call, Bill Wehrum, the head of the EPA\u2019s Office of Air and Radiation, said \u201cthe situation\u201d with cars and light-duty trucks \u201cis much different from heavy-duty trucks.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an apples and oranges thing,\u201d he said, without going into detail.\n\nYet the effort bears remarkable similarities to the fuel economy rule. The move came in response to a petition submitted in late 2016, for which California is already racing to draft regulations. In hopes of creating a 50-state standard, the EPA is now stepping in.\n\n\u201cIf the agency is legitimately responding to the petition that was submitted in 2016 and moving forward to look at the technologies now available to greatly reduce NOx emissions, that would be a positive for air quality and public health,\u201d Janet McCabe, Wehrum\u2019s predecessor under Obama, said in an email.\n\nBut the policy could also undercut the EPA\u2019s stalled effort to cut Obama-era air pollution limits for trucks with rebuilt engines. Wheeler reversed former Administrator Scott Pruitt\u2019s decision to halt enforcement of the so-called \u201cglider rule\u201d in July after 16 states sued to force the agency to regulate the \u201csuper-polluting\u201d trucks.\n\nThe final rule is now listed in the Federal Register as \u201cto be determined.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will EPA\u2019s final position be on glider kits?\u201d said Stan Meiburg, a former acting deputy EPA administrator who spent 39 years at the agency. \u201cIt would be inconsistent for the agency to regulate new engines more tightly while allowing a loophole for discounted, older, more polluting engines to remain in commerce.\u201d", "A Florida educator is accused of stealing nearly $1,000 from a child with disabilities.\n\nEdward John Abernathy, 50, principal of Connerton Elementary School in Land O\u2019Lakes, was arrested on Nov. 8 and charged with grand theft, according to the Pasco County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nA copy of the police report obtained by HuffPost alleges a 9-year-old boy with a mental disability brought $2,100 of his parents\u2019 money with him to school on Oct. 23.

The largest caravan was believed to have formed in Honduras on Oct. 12 and first was featured in a \u201cFox & Friends\u201d segment four days later, which prompted a tweet from the show\u2019s most famous fan.\n\nULISES RUIZ via Getty Images Migrants from poor Central American countries - mostly Hondurans - moving towards the United States in hopes of a better life, walk along the road between Zapopan and Tequila in the Mexican state of Jalisco, on their trek north, on November 13, 2018. (ULISES RUIZ/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAs the midterms approached, Trump and his conservative allies flooded the zone with harsh rhetoric and hardline policy proposals, including sending troops to the border, revoking birthright citizenship and an ad featuring a Latino man convicted of killing two police officers that was widely condemned as racist.\n\nBut the caravan was Trump\u2019s favorite talking point. During his final blitz of campaign rallies, he hammered at the threat night after night and, without evidence, suggested that Democrats were supporting \u2014 and perhaps funding \u2014 the march of migrants.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are inviting caravan after caravan of illegal aliens to pour into our country, overwhelming your schools, your hospitals, and your communities,\u201d Trump said in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, on election eve. \u201cIf you want more caravans, if you want more crime, vote Democrat tomorrow. ... If you want strong borders and safe communities, no drugs, no caravans, vote Republican.\u201d\n\nTrump ratcheted up his rhetoric on Twitter too. One tweet read: \u201cWe will NOT let these Caravans, which are also made up of some very bad thugs and gang members, into the U.S. Our Border is sacred, must come in legally. TURN AROUND!\u201d\n\nThat tweet, on Oct. 31, was his last on the subject. Since the election, he\u2019s invoked the caravan only once. Asked about it during a news conference last Wednesday, Trump said \u201cI\u2019m not just talking about the caravans\u201d when talking about militarizing the southern border and his proposed wall.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A Central American migrant holds a sign with a message that reads in Spanish: \"No to the wall Trump\", while hitching a ride on a truck in Tepotzotlan, Mexico, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether further action on immigration was imminent.\n\n\u201cClearly, this was an election-eve stunt designed to whip up the base that really didn\u2019t have much foundation in fact and, clearly, when the election was over there was no need to keep beating those drums,\u201d said Mark Feldstein, journalism professor at the University of Maryland. He added that what the conservative media did with the story was \u201creally toxic\u201d and divided an already polarized country.\n\n\u201cThe very fact that they dropped it so suddenly is just further confirmation of how bogus the story was in the first place,\u201d Feldstein said.\n\nFox News spent more than 33 hours discussing the caravan through Election Day, according to a study by Media Matters, a progressive media watchdog organization. On Nov. 7, the day after the election, Fox had no discussions centered on the caravan. On Nov. 8, the network spent four minutes and 57 seconds on discussions centered on the caravan, according to the study.\n\nSome Republicans said the caravan\u2019s fade from the spotlight was a natural part of the election cycle.\n\n\u201cEvery election, there are a series of issues that rise to artificial highs and then, once the votes are cast, settle back down to normal noise,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, former press secretary to President George W. Bush. \u201cBoth parties do it; this isn\u2019t some trumped up phony issue. The caravan will be back in the news once it gets closer to the border.\u201d\n\nTrump had suggested sending up to 15,000 troops to the border; currently there are approximately 1,000 at the border itself and another 4,800 in staging areas nearby. The deployment is scheduled to end Dec. 15 but that could be changed, extended or shortened.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis plans to visit the border Wednesday. He was asked by a reporter Tuesday whether the military mission along the border of south Texas will change, now that the lead migrant caravan in Mexico is headed much farther west.\n\n\u201cRight now, the mission is exactly what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what the future holds. But right now that\u2019s the only mission I have.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLemire reported from New York.

But much larger percentages somewhat backed the ideas. In total, 40 percent of Republicans expressed at least some support for a polluter fee and 48 percent at least somewhat endorsed the green jobs policy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging that 40 percent of Republicans would support and only 36 percent would oppose a polluter fee,\u201d said former Rep.

You\u2019re standing at the front of the conference room, running through a presentation for your bosses and co-workers. It\u2019s an important meeting and the stakes are high. Your heart is racing and your palms start to sweat. You wipe them on your pants and continue, but you\u2019re embarrassed by how clammy they are, especially as they cause you to fumble with your notes, almost dropping them.\n\nSweaty hands happen to the best of us. According to experts, it\u2019s a perfectly normal response to a stressful situation. But what is the science behind this phenomenon, and how can you go about troubleshooting it? Below is a breakdown of everything you need to know.\n\nWhy do hands get sweaty?\n\nPeopleImages via Getty Images\n\nThe primary purpose of sweating is to cool down your body temperature, which explains why you perspire when you\u2019re overheated or from going for a jog. However, your body also triggers that response when you go into \u201cfight or flight\u201d mode from a stressful situation, said Darria Long Gillespie, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Tennessee School of Medicine and author of the upcoming book Mom Hacks.\n\n\u201cSince your brain doesn\u2019t really know the difference between a stressor like having to run from a tiger \u2015 like your caveman ancestors may have had to do \u2015 vs. giving a talk in front of your boss \u2015 like you have to do \u2015 it responds in the same way, causing you to sweat,\u201d said Long Gillespie, who has blogged for HuffPost in the past.\n\nMarlyanne Pol-Rodriguez, a dermatologist at Stanford Health Care, notes that sweat can be stimulated by your sympathetic nervous system, which is in charge of that fight-or-flight response and helps you function more effectively in times of alarm.\n\nBut why your hands, specifically? That goes back to prehistoric times, too. They may become concentrated with sweat because \u201ca little bit of moisture on your palms is thought to improve grip,\u201d Pol-Rodriguez said.\n\nSweat tends to pool in specific places; the hands are one of them. In situations where you\u2019re nervous or stressed, Pol-Rodriguez said, this sweat often shows up in the form of clammy hands, as there are higher concentrations of sweat glands on your palms and on \u201cthe soles of your feet, some areas of the face and armpits.\u201d\n\nWhat triggers it?\n\nPol-Rodriguez said that sweaty palms are an emotional response and can be triggered by feelings such as fear or anxiety.\n\n\u201cThe sweating tends to be controlled by the hypothalamus in the brain and so the hypothalamus kind of processes that signal of the emotion and translates it into increased sweating,\u201d she explained.\n\nAccording to David Spratte, CEO and founder of Carpe, a company that makes antiperspirant lotion for sweaty hands, any situation that can trigger a nervous or excited feeling has the ability to elicit what he refers to as \u201cstress sweat\u201d \u2015 public speaking, a first date, an intense social engagement, or a sudden moment of panic, like realizing you missed an important deadline.\n\nAdam Splaver, a South Florida cardiologist at NanoHealth Associates, points out that certain foods like spicy dishes, as well as smoking and caffeine consumption, can also be a catalyst for perspiring hands.\n\nHow to troubleshoot it\n\nYou often have very little say in how or when perspiration pops up.\n\n\u201cEmotional stress, which is typically the cause of sweaty palms, can be difficult to control,\u201d said Timothy Mynes, an area medical director at MedExpress, a nationwide urgent care center. \u201cSweaty hands can be a challenge to overcome \u2015 but it can be done.\u201d\n\nHere are a few tips that Mynes shares with his patients:\n\nIf you know you\u2019re going to have a particularly stressful day, practice taking deep breaths. \u201cIt sounds simple but taking a deep breath and holding it for a few seconds, then releasing it, can really help get your mind off whatever may be bothering you,\u201d he said.\n\nTry putting a little bit of antiperspirant on your hands at night. Nighttime is the best time to apply antiperspirant, Mynes said, since it allows the ingredients to soak into your skin and block sweat glands.\n\nPack a small bag of baking powder or cornstarch in your purse or briefcase, and apply it to your palms before a stressful situation. \u201c Both will help absorb excess moisture in a pinch,\u201d Mynes said.\n\nWhen your palms become too sweaty\n\nMorsa Images via Getty Images\n\nA little bit of sweat on your palms before a big sales pitch is perfectly normal, but if you find that it\u2019s interfering with your life or makes you feel insecure, you should talk to a health care professional.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible you may have palmar hyperhidrosis, which is [an] excessive sweating [condition], and there are treatment options available to help tackle it,\u201d Mynes said.\n\nAccording to Todd Minars, a dermatologist with Minars Dermatology in Hollywood, Florida, ways to address the issue include Botox and procedural options like iontophoresis \u2015 a method where a patient puts their hand in water as a device sends a small electrical current through it. This could lead to up to a 50 percent decrease in sweat production, Minars said.", "That\u2019s a Yabba Dabba Don\u2019t!\n\nFred Flintstone joined celebrities in trouble with the law when a sheriff\u2019s deputy in Pasco County, Florida, pulled him over Nov. 4 for speeding in a Wesley Chapel housing development.\n\nPolice identified the driver as Mr. Fred Flinstone (sic), and said his real name is Don Swartz.

Kim, who like other elected officials said he had no knowledge of Cuomo\u2019s and de Blasio\u2019s offers to Amazon, did not sign the 2017 letter.\n\nKim represents an opposite philosophical flank of the Democratic Party from Cuomo, who joked about changing his name to \u201cAmazon Cuomo\u201d if the tech giant made New York City its new home. Kim sides with antitrust experts who believe that Amazon\u2019s rapid expansion and power as an online platform have allowed it to stifle genuine competition.\n\n\u201cAmazon is not the solution to every problem; it is the opposite of that,\u201d Kim told HuffPost. \u201cI always felt strongly that it should be broken up instead of embraced.\u201d\n\nHuffPost reached out to state Assemblywoman Catherine Nolan, who represents Long Island City, as well as U.S. Reps. Carolyn Maloney and Grace Meng, who represent Queens, for their reactions to the accord but did not receive a response. All three lawmakers signed on to the letter.\n\nNew Yorkers will get their first chance to hold elected officials accountable for their actions at the ballot box in February, when the city holds a special election for the job of public advocate. Letitia James, the city\u2019s current public advocate, was elected attorney general of New York last Tuesday, creating a vacancy in the senior post.\n\nThe office of New York City\u2019s public advocate is meant to be a people\u2019s ombudsman vis-\u00e0-vis the mayor and City Hall, potentially making it a useful tool for HQ2 critics and outright opponents.\n\nAt least three contenders for the position signed the 2017 letter welcoming Amazon to New York City: state Assemblyman Michael Blake, New York City Councilman Robert Cornegy and New York City Councilman Jumaane Williams.\n\nFormer City Council President Melissa Mark-Viverito, who is rumored to be considering a run for public advocate, also signed the letter.\n\nMark-Viverito criticized the deal on Tuesday. \u201cTale of two cities: Billions for Amazon... crumbling subways for the rest of us,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nAssemblyman Blake told HuffPost he also opposed the deal in its current form and plans to attend the Wednesday rally against HQ2 in Long Island City, Queens. But Blake, who said he learned about the agreement from Twitter and news stories, is not necessarily opposed to all public subsidies for HQ2.\n\n\u201cCan you have a public-private partnership that is good for the people of New York City? Absolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cBut until you have that certainty, you can\u2019t move forward with something of this magnitude.\u201d\n\nBlake did not specify what improvements to the agreement would earn his support, though he called for major new investments in public transportation and public housing.\n\nIn a statement distributed to the press, Williams called the October 2017 letter the \u201cbeginning of a conversation\u201d that he never imagined would produce a secretive, multibillion-dollar subsidy package.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that Amazon intends to move forward in its plan without adequate dialogue and compromise,\u201d he concluded. \u201cI am opposing this deal as it stands, and will do all in my power to fight its implementation.\u201d\n\nHowever, Nomiki Konst, an investigative journalist and progressive activist running for public advocate, told HuffPost that signing the letter should be disqualifying.", "George Pimentel via Getty Images Singer-songwriter Teddy Geiger (left) and \"Schitt's Creek\" star Emily Hampshire first confirmed their relationship in September.\n\nSinger-songwriter Teddy Geiger and \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d actress Emily Hampshire are altar-bound.\n\nGeiger announced the couple\u2019s engagement in a series of emotional Instagram posts on Friday; she said she was \u201cso fucking happy\u201d to spend the rest of her life with Hampshire.\n\nHampshire, meanwhile, offered similar sentiments in an Instagram post of her own, joking that Geiger \u201cwas glad she got her nails done today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like the luckiest girl in the world,\u201d she added.\n\nGeiger, who is best known for the 2006 hit, \u201cFor You I Will (Confidence),\u201d and her collaborations with Shawn Mendes and One Direction, first confirmed she and Hampshire were dating in September. The couple also appeared together at a number of Toronto International Film Festival events that month.", "If I asked you to describe the quintessential college head football coach, you\u2019d tell me about a man, most likely one who is middle-age and white, wearing a headset and a hoodie or a polo shirt (depending on the team you root for) while pacing a sideline.\n\nBehind a microphone and in front of cameras, he\u2019d be folksy, stoic unless he\u2019s angry, probably attends church and lets you know it, and is sparse with his words but well-versed in vague coach-speak about teamwork, his love of the game, and the toughness, the effort, the discipline, the pride, the grit with which his teams play.\n\nYou might believe he spends endless hours at practices, drawing up plays and recruiting. He likely makes good money, but you\u2019d probably feel obligated to say that he does what he does because he wants to make the lives of these young players better, help mold them into men with good characters. He is, overall, a good man who has dedicated his life to the sport.\n\nAnd so, when a college football coach makes harmful decisions, exploits the bodies and labor of his players or brushes aside someone vulnerable or less powerful, we struggle to make sense of this behavior, even if we understand that this coach is operating inside of a giant money-making machine of toxic masculinity that flattens anyone who fails to win enough games or to make boosters happy. In order for us to imagine him doing a bad thing, we first must overcome our ingrained belief that to be a coach is the same as being a good person.\n\nWe must overcome our ingrained belief that being a coach is the same as being a good person.\n\nIt is time to rewrite this narrative. We need a new story because the one we\u2019ve become used to provides way too much protection to powerful men who use their authority to their advantage in order to disenfranchise, abuse and manipulate the people they have power over.\n\nHow else do you explain the tragedy at University of Maryland under the leadership of their head football coach, D.J. Durkin?\n\nIn May, 19-year-old Maryland offensive lineman Jordan McNair collapsed on the field after struggling to do wind sprints during an off-season practice session. It took about 30 minutes for trainers to take him off the field, another 30 after that to call for an ambulance, and yet another 30 before the ambulance left for the hospital. Just over two weeks later, McNair died from preventable heatstroke that no one in the Maryland football program tried to prevent.\n\nThe fallout from the death of a university student from an extreme workout overseen on university property by university employees took two external investigations and about five months to play out. The recent report from one of those investigations found that the program had \u201ca culture where problems festered because too many players feared speaking out.\u201d\n\nThe investigators, of course, wrote, \u201cwe believe [Durkin\u2019s] concern for his players\u2019 welfare is genuine.\u201d The Washington Post noted that \u201cthe sentiment from players varied,\u201d and included some players who believed Durkin should not return and former players stating that he should never coach again.\n\nThe Board of Regents didn\u2019t want Durkin to go and advocated for him, reportedly threatening the president\u2019s job if he fired the coach. They also didn\u2019t want to punish the trainers whose failures led directly to McNair\u2019s death. If you are under the impression that this had to do with winning, let me assure you that Durkin\u2019s 10-15 record at Maryland could not have been the reason for this cowardly move. Regardless, when the investigation concluded, Durkin was reinstated as head football coach.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Students at the University of Maryland quickly protested Durkin\u2019s reinstatement.\n\nThe good news is we are getting better at seeing through this facade about coaches. Protests immediately greeted Durkin\u2019s reinstatement, including from Maryland\u2019s governor, university alumni, members of the media, students at the school and players on his own squad who walked out of a team meeting.\n\nAnd so, the university president fired Durkin late last month, days after reinstating him. Last week, they fired two of the trainers who failed in their treatment of McNair (Rick Court, the strength and conditioning coach who oversaw that tragic practice in May, resigned back in August).\n\nIt's not only coaches who benefit from this kind of thinking that one\u2019s chosen profession says something positive about their inherent character.\n\nAnd it is not only coaches who benefit from the kind of thinking that one\u2019s chosen profession says something positive about a person\u2019s inherent character.\n\nNo matter how many reports reveal that police lie, we mostly take their accounts of events, even those involving police violence. Too many doctors across the country can be classified as \u201cpredatory physicians\u201d but The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that there are a whole host of ways that their behavior is swept aside even if reported to authorities (Larry Nassar is perhaps the most obvious case). One thinks about the horrific and huge ongoing reckoning in the Catholic Church, or the continued problem of gendered violence among soldiers.\n\nEnough with this. We have to begin to sketch out new narratives about who college football coaches are (or, at the least, who they could be). We must question our assumptions every time they crop up because these assumptions favor the people who already have power, who often have money and normally a whole host of other privileges. The least we can do is remove this one other layer of protection from their rather bulky defenses.\n\nWe have a long way to go before we finally take control of this. But the toughness, the effort, the discipline, the pride, the grit that goes into this work will be worth it in the end. Because what really are we preserving otherwise? A system that finds it hard to punish someone whose program failed to prevent the preventable death of a college student under his care. And that is unacceptable.", "The White House on Tuesday issued a carefully worded defense of its decision to revoke CNN reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s press credentials shortly after the network sued President Donald Trump\u2019s administration over the matter.\n\nThe drama stems from last week\u2019s combative press conference, during which Trump repeatedly lashed out at reporters for clamoring to ask questions.\n\nAlthough press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders initially accused Acosta of improperly laying his hands on a female intern attempting to take the microphone from him, in its most recent statement the White House shifted its argument to accuse Acosta of simply being rude.\n\n\u201cAfter Mr. Acosta asked the President two questions \u2015 each of which the President answered \u2015 he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions,\u201d the White House said Tuesday.\n\nMany of the reporters present at the press conference attempted to ask additional questions, prolonging their time with the microphone. Yet the White House says it singled out Acosta because this was not the first time he \u201cinappropriately refused to yield to other reporters.\u201d\n\nThe evening of the press conference, Sanders shared an apparently manipulated video to bolster her argument that Acosta touched the intern inappropriately, and she received swift backlash.\n\nThe newest statement made no mention of the allegation, saying, \u201cThe White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional.\u201d\n\nCNN called the revocation of its reporter\u2019s credentials a \u201cwrongful\u201d violation of the First Amendment.\n\n\u201cIf left unchallenged, the actions of the White House would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials,\u201d the network said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe administration argued that the First Amendment \u201cis not served\u201d by Acosta\u2019s behavior, which \u201cimpedes the ability of the President, the White House staff, and members of the media to conduct business.\u201d It dismissed CNN\u2019s suit \u201cjust more grandstanding.\u201d\n\nNumerous reporters and free-press advocates criticized the administration\u2019s decision to pull Acosta\u2019s credentials, which was seen as an escalation of the president\u2019s habitual attacks on the media. The White House Correspondents Association called the move \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cJournalists may use a range of approaches to carry out their jobs and the WHCA does not police the tone or frequency of the questions its members ask of powerful senior government officials, including the President,\u201d the group said in a statement.", "Samantha Bee chirped about her \u201cChristmas on I.C.E.\u201d special in a trailer that dropped Monday (see it below).

It is Wonder Woman, but there\u2019s a larger piece, I think, that it is not to exclude men. It is for women to get together as we do in life, as we do in everyday life, that we are for one another, that there is something about community that we do. We do it every day of our lives. We do it from the time we are tiny. We build our own little communities... We dress for each other, for crying out loud. I still dress for my girlfriends. My husband would not remember what I wore for this thing or that thing for the life of him. My girlfriends will say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wear that? Remember that thing you wore?\u201d I know this may sound airy-fairy, it may sound silly, but it\u2019s because we enjoy it. We love to look at each other. We love it. We make each other feel good.\n\nHow do you try to support other women?\n\nWe\u2019re the first ones to cheer one another on about working out or looking good or feeling better or about a health scare or coming together for our own health or our children\u2019s health. We look out for each other as we do for our families. Yes, we do in our work. We\u2019re always for each other as we are for one another\u2019s families. I think that\u2019s part of something that we are born with, as well as our competitiveness, as well as our courage, as well as our stamina, as well as all the rest of it... That\u2019s just who we are. I am not taking away anything from the men who support us, and I think it\u2019s one of our jobs as women to say to the men that champion women, \u201cWe love you and we need you, too. We need you, but we got this part of us.\u201d We got the feminist part of us. We don\u2019t need you to do that. We\u2019ve got this.\n\nYou\u2019ve been an advocate for women\u2019s rights. Now that we\u2019re a year into the Me Too and Time\u2019s Up movements, how much more relevance do you feel like it\u2019s taken on, and what do you think about the longtime impact for women\u2019s rights and equality?\n\nI think that we must not lump all men into \u201cYou better be careful.\u201d I think that we need to lift men up that champion us. Fathers, men in the barroom, the locker room, you have to teach your sons, like we had to teach our sons that being smart was cool... When you diss a woman, you\u2019re dissing your sister, your mother, your grandmother. So when you are making fun of or trashing a woman, you\u2019re trashing my mom. You\u2019re trashing my sister. You\u2019re trashing my grandmother, my aunt. We need fathers to teach their sons, so when you lump all men into one big thing and you say, \u201cWell,\u201d they are resentful of that. \u201cI don\u2019t behave that way. I didn\u2019t behave that way and I don\u2019t behave that way.\u201d I think a lot of the men who have behaved that way would not do so in front of other men. They do it in secret... We need to acknowledge that when corporations, even with valuable employees, this is what we\u2019ve heard, that if either one stops them, that it challenges them about their behavior, that it empowers women to come forward, and that there are consequences.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a year since the new \u201cWonder Woman\u201d hit screens. Were you surprised at the amount of success the film had?\n\nI\u2019m not surprised at all. And the reason I\u2019m not surprised is because of who was at the helm: Patty Jenkins. Patty and I talked, just a couple of weeks after she got the job. She called me and we talked because she wanted to put me in in some way in the film. It didn\u2019t work out, but scheduling and things, but she grew up with my version of Wonder Woman, because my version was not on the pages of the comic books. In the comic books, she was intelligent and a feminist and strong, but they had this alter ego where she\u2019s dumb, and I didn\u2019t play that. You can\u2019t have her as [that]... You just have to suspend reality that it\u2019s not the same person.\n\nAlbert L. Ortega via Getty Images Carter spoke with director Patty Jenkins during the making of 2017's \"Wonder Woman.\"\n\nWhat do you think about Patty\u2019s direction bringing Wonder Woman alive on the screen?\n\nShe\u2019s always Diana, and that\u2019s really the key to what I think Patty did, is that she was always Diana even when she was Wonder Woman. She\u2019s always who she is, the kindness. She doesn\u2019t suffer bullies. She is the same person with the sense of humor that \u2015 that wry sense of humor and self-deprecation and doesn\u2019t take herself so seriously and has a sense of humor and engages both men and women and doesn\u2019t objectify herself. I did not objectify myself. It is just what I was. When she put on her outfit, she didn\u2019t put it on to necessarily... It\u2019s like I said. We dress for each other. It isn\u2019t to create lust. Maybe it is. So what if it is? We just want to look good when we... But if something scary happened, we would not be happy. That costume was not particularly revealing. It was a one-piece bathing suit... I just think she was a wonderful character. When I played her, there was a kindness and a goodness and all those great and wonderful things that we are. It\u2019s who we are. Yet, she can\u2019t be victimized. It\u2019s everything we are, but she cannot be taken advantage of by men.\n\nI understand you didn\u2019t give any advice to actress Gal Gadot, who took on the role of Wonder Woman in the film.\n\nOh, God no. Because an actor would never do that to another actor. Patty and I talked, but an actor would never give it to another actor... I think that they bring such a great message and it\u2019s so much fun. I\u2019m just so grateful that they, in particular Patty, really got it, what people loved about the character and why so many people loved her.\n\nI know you said it didn\u2019t work out for you appearing the last movie.

It has always had a life of its own... I love hearing people\u2019s stories. I think that\u2019s the thing I like the most, is just to hear other people\u2019s stories.

And they flew far and wide. It wasn\u2019t uncommon to find her book Sex Chronicles atop an auntie\u2019s dresser and Gettin\u2019 Buck Wild peeking from a teacher\u2019s purse. During this time, Zane was both everywhere and nowhere. Her signature style of erotica, potently black in its prose and vivid in its imagery, affirmed to readers across the nation that erotic fiction could be about more than carnal desire. Her stories lent more focus to character development than sheer pornography. Zane\u2019s erotica was not written simply to help you finish; it was written to keep you reading until the end.\n\nBut even as her books were sold en masse, the author enjoyed the obscurity afforded through her pseudonym. She didn\u2019t even reveal herself as Zane to family members until she\u2019d written multiple bestsellers. For Zane, this obscurity has always been a choice to bypass celebrity and maintain focus instead on her work, which continues steadily.\n\nZane, now the creator of an erotic podcast, \u201cPurple Panties,\u201d took time to talk with HuffPost about the evolution of erotic writing, her hallowed space as the \u201cQueen of Erotica\u201d and whether, as a pioneer, she has been given the respect she deserves.\n\nMonica Morgan via Getty Images Kristina \"Zane\" Laferne Roberts poses with fans at the 2015 Women's Empowerment Expo at Cobo Center in Detroit.\n\nHow did your upbringing lead to your creation of \u201cZane\u201d?\n\nWell, one thing I appreciate my parents for is that they exposed us to a lot of stuff. My father taught at the University of Argentina, Oxford, Duke, Yale and all these other places, so we were exposed to a lot of different cultures and races at a very young age. I love the way my parents taught me humility and how to embrace the differences in others instead of fear them. My father is an expert in world religion, so we\u2019d go to our regular church \u2014 he grew up Baptist, my mother grew up AME. But he would also take us to synagogues, and Buddhist temples and stuff like that. We would learn to appreciate differences. I\u2019ve learned to appreciate creativity more than anything else. I see the beauty in different types of writing and television shows. And with that being said, that attitude has always made me Zane.\n\nGrowing up in a religious household, did you ever feel that becoming Zane was in defiance of the way you were raised?\n\nI\u2019ve always been very open when it comes to sexuality, just like I\u2019m open about other stuff. One reason I used the pen name was because my father is rather well-known in the religious community. He actually has \u2014 probably \u2014 more books out than I do. So I was nervous about that. But when he found out, it wasn\u2019t a big deal to him. I was kind of surprised at that. I told my mother, and she told my father, but for about five years they didn\u2019t know I was Zane.\n\nI never had interest in being famous. I still don\u2019t. Zane\n\nThey saw your rise as an author without even knowing it was you?\n\nThey didn\u2019t know I was Zane, no. I\u2019d already told my parents, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about writing a book, but under a pseudonym.\u201d And they were like, \u201cWhy would you write under a pseudonym?\u201d I just said, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d and left it at that. So I finally told my mother when I had three out of five of the bestsellers on Essence\u2019s bestseller list. We\u2019d gone to the farmers\u2019 market one day, and I told her to stop by CVS drugstore. I went in, bought a copy of Essence and brought it back out, and I said, \u201cYou see this bestseller list? This Zane person: That\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nDamn. That\u2019s an incredible unveiling.\n\nThe reason I finally had to do it was that I was still working my corporate job for no reason. At that point, I had sold millions of dollars worth of books, and I was still going to work because I didn\u2019t want my parents to wonder how I was paying my bills with no job. I was still going to work for the hell of it, to be honest. I just decided it was silly what I was doing, so that\u2019s when I came out with it.\n\nWhat was it like to reveal yourself to the world in that way? Was it freeing? Was it horrifying?\n\nA little bit of both. I orchestrated it myself \u2014 I let The New York Times do a great reveal, because it was getting too crazy with people trying to figure out who I was. And I also had people pretending to be me, which was pretty silly. And that still happens sometimes, by the way. You know, people pretending to be Zane. I just decided it was time to do it. I never had interest in being famous. I still don\u2019t.\n\nWhen some other women of other races came out and did this way after I did it, people acted like it was the first time it\u2019d been done. It wasn\u2019t even the first time it\u2019d been done when I did it. Zane\n\nWith the popularity of \u201c50 Shades of Grey,\u201d it feels like we\u2019re just getting around to appreciating and respecting the genre of erotic literature. We\u2019re seeing it embraced more widely in mainstream society. You\u2019ve been doing this work for a long time. Do you feel you\u2019ve been given the respect you\u2019re owed?\n\nNo, I really don\u2019t \u2014 just being honest. When some other women of other races came out and did this way after I did it, people acted like it was the first time it\u2019d been done. It wasn\u2019t even the first time it\u2019d been done when I did it. What I did was bring erotica \u2014 at least, black erotica \u2014 to the front of the bookstore.\n\nWhat was the reception like then \u2014 and what is it like for you now \u2014 from your black women readers?\n\nIt\u2019s been great. A lot of black women have told me I sexually liberated them well into their 40s and 50s, because they\u2019d had hang-ups before they started reading my books. I had so many women thanking me for letting them know they were normal \u2014 that it was OK to have those types of feelings and OK to have those types of desires. And that\u2019s why my first book was called The Sex Chronicles: Shattering the Myth. There were so many myths about African-American women and our sexuality, and women period.\n\nI want readers to understand who these characters are to each other. All this raunchy, freaky stuff \u2014 what is driving them to do that? Anyone can write the sex. Zane\n\nHas your writing changed over the years as our national conversations about women have changed? Have you felt your writing mature at all?\n\nI know I\u2019ve matured. I know I\u2019m not the same person I was 21 years ago when I became Zane. That would be crazy if I was. When I first started writing about the \u201cDick You Down Crew\u201d or the \u201cPussy Bandits,\u201d I was 30, you know? Of course I\u2019ve matured, but I still have a vivid imagination.\n\nMy books have always dealt with heavy topics. A lot of it deals with what I see a lot of women going through. For example, as sexual as my book \u201cVengeance\u201d is, it\u2019s really about the issue of multigenerational mental illness in the African-American community.\n\nDo you feel there\u2019s always been a space for erotic literature to address these sorts of topics?\n\nIf you\u2019re just reading something to get off, that\u2019s porn. To me, an erotic story has character development. I want my readers to understand why my characters are having sex. I want readers to understand who these characters are to each other. All this raunchy, freaky stuff \u2014 what is driving them to do that? Anyone can write the sex.\n\n\u201cPurple Panties\u201d is your foray into the world of erotic podcasting. Why now?\n\nWell, I was approached about doing an erotic podcast, and I decided on \u201cPurple Panties.\u201d I enjoyed it. It\u2019s a different medium for me. I wanted to do it because I\u2019ve done theater, I\u2019ve done movies, I\u2019ve done television; this was something I\u2019d not done. And I believe that being creative in different media can be challenging. I took a challenge, and I\u2019m very proud of the outcome.\n\nHow does writing podcast scripts differ from writing scripts for other media?", "CNN Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appeared on CNN's \"Boss Files\" on Nov. 13, discussing gender equality, trade and relations with the U.S and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThree years ago, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that half his Cabinet ministers would be women, saying simply, \u201cIt\u2019s 2015.\u201d Now the gender equality advocate is reminding the world why equal representation in politics really matters.\n\n\u201cWhy do it was fundamental to governing well,\u201d Trudeau explained his 2015 move to CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow during a Monday night segment on \u201cBoss Files.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you have a broader group of people with different perspectives, with different backgrounds, with different stories, with different life experiences,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou\u2019re actually much better able to solve different problems and solve them in a way that is going to respond the needs people have.\u201d\n\nTrudeau said that although Canada\u2019s Parliament doesn\u2019t have full gender representation yet, he hopes he can lead by example.

I can control the numbers in my Cabinet,\u201d he said. \u201cModeling that leadership of making a determination that, yes, it\u2019s 2015, we had to do that, is important. But also modeling that you get better government out of it, that it\u2019s not just the right thing to do, it\u2019s the smart thing to do, is the message that\u2019s resonating more and more these past few years.\u201d\n\n\"Absolutely, I'm a feminist.\"\n\n\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tells @PoppyHarlowCNN how he became a feminist, explains what he is doing to fight for pay equality and why he's mandated half his cabinet be women. pic.twitter.com/UJ8ThBbHPt \u2014 CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) November 12, 2018\n\nAs a self-proclaimed feminist who has backed up many of his ideas with policy, Trudeau told Harlow he has faced some challenges in his attempts to implement equal gender representation. In the process, he noticed how enthusiastic men are to be allies.\n\n\u201cOne [positive] is how eager men are to be allies to women, but how much uncertainty there is about how to do it or whether it\u2019s OK to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think one of the conversations we\u2019re seeing more and more is we\u2019re seeing men stepping up and asking how to be allies and figuring out how to be better allies. And that\u2019s something that\u2019s been a positive surprise.\u201d\n\nTrudeau said later in the conversation that the recent prominence of the Me Too movement has \u201cabsolutely\u201d changed the way he leads.\n\n\u201cI think respecting and leaving room for multiple voices and multiple experiences is essential in our conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the unfounded cases that get dismissed by police services across our country ... or the disbelief with which a survivor is treated when she comes forward with her story.\u201d\n\nIn July allegations resurfaced that Trudeau groped a woman at a music festival in Creston, British Columbia, nearly two decades ago. The Canadian leader said that he didn\u2019t recall \u201cany negative interactions that day,\u201d but later said that men can experience \u201can interaction as being benign or not inappropriate and a woman, particularly in a professional context, can experience it differently\u201d and \u201cwe have to respect that.\u201d\n\nIn response to the Me Too movement, Trudeau said that it\u2019s important to \u201cstart from a place of support and belief.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat changes how we engage in our workplaces.

While the show isn\u2019t the first to mine the teenage experience for song-and-dance numbers, it couldn\u2019t feel more topical amid America\u2019s current political divide.\n\nOpening Nov. 15 at New York\u2019s Longacre Theatre, \u201cThe Prom\u201d follows Emma (played by Caitlin Kinnunen), a lesbian high school student who is banned from bringing her closeted girlfriend, Alyssa Greene (Isabelle McCalla), to the prom in Edgewater, Indiana. Things start looking up for Emma, however, when news of the school dance debacle catches the attention of four down-on-their-luck Broadway stars (Christopher Sieber, Brooks Ashmanskas, Beth Leavel and Angie Schworer). The out-of-work performers travel to conservative Edgewater to rally on Emma\u2019s behalf, but see the case as an opportunity to boost their own showbiz relevance under the guise of philanthropy. (Watch a clip of Kinnunen performing \u201cDance With You\u201d above.)\n\n\u201cThe Prom\u201d features music and lyrics by Chad Beguelin and Matthew Sklar, and is directed and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw, whose credits include \u201cThe Book of Mormon\u201d and the stage adaptation of Disney\u2019s \u201cAladdin.\u201d Beguelin co-wrote the show\u2019s book with Bob Martin, and the two have said they were inspired by a number of real-life incidents in which queer teens were forbidden from attending dances and other school functions with same-sex dates.\n\nNathan Johnson In Broadway's \"The Prom,\" Caitlin Kinnunen and Isabelle McCalla portray a lesbian teen couple forbidden from attending their prom together.\n\nThe comedy\u2019s undeniable heart, however, is Kinnunen. The Camano Island, Washington, native first auditioned for the creative team in 2014, two years before the show premiered at Atlanta\u2019s Alliance Theatre, and calls it her \u201cmost exciting and nerve-wracking\u201d project to date.\n\nAt 26, Kinnunen is no theatrical novice, having starred in the Broadway productions of \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d and \u201cThe Bridges of Madison County,\u201d along with numerous regional shows. She initially tried out for the part of Alyssa \u2015 at the time, the creative team was calling the show \u201cThe Untitled Prom Project\u201d \u2015 but before long, found herself better suited for Emma.\n\n\u201cThey were like, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re not really a cheerleader. How about you read for this role instead?\u2019 I didn\u2019t really have any knowledge of what the role was, but they liked me in it,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I showed up for the first rehearsal that I was like, \u2018Oh, this is what this is. This is amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Atlanta production of \u201cThe Prom\u201d opened in 2016 to favorable reviews. Variety praised the show as \u201cloopy, loving and joyous,\u201d while the Atlanta Journal-Constitution called it a \u201ccrowd-pleasing spectacle with a well-intentioned message\u201d and \u201cdelightful good fun.\u201d\n\nDeen van Meer \u201cIt has a gentle way of bringing up the conversation of acceptance, and we\u2019re able to open doors to that conversation with comedy, music and levity,\" Kinnunen said of the new musical, opening Nov. 15 on Broadway.\n\nThe success of the show meant producers began plotting a move to Broadway almost immediately. But like many of her castmates, Kinnunen questioned whether a story about a lesbian teen\u2019s struggle would continue to resonate as audiences became more accustomed to marriage equality and other LGBTQ social advances. That year, however, brought the election of President Donald Trump, whose administration has worked to roll back rights for the LGBTQ community.\n\n\u201cIt was a fascinating process, because it went through waves of, \u2018Is this show still relevant?\u2019 We didn\u2019t know if we could still do it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then, it sadly was, \u2018No, we can still do it. This is still happening.\u2019 Especially in 2018, with all that\u2019s going on in the world, it\u2019s more relevant now than it ever has been.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really good because it doesn\u2019t beat you over the head with its message,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt has a gentle way of bringing up the conversation of acceptance, and we\u2019re able to open doors to that conversation with comedy, music and levity instead of saying, \u2018These are serious issues. We must talk about them now.\u2019\u201d\n\nDeen van Meer Kinnunen (right, shown with McCalla) says playing Emma is \u201cthe next step in my journey of telling meaningful stories onstage.\u201d\n\nUnlike Emma, Kinnunen doesn\u2019t identify as LGBTQ in real life, but she nonetheless says she felt like an outcast during her adolescent years. When she was 8, she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, which required her to be home-schooled. Collectively, she said, those experiences \u201cforced me to grow up really quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was always the home-schooled girl who did theater \u2015 no one was like, \u2018Oh, yeah, she sounds cool,\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not comparing that to the struggles that the LGBTQ community faces. But I think I\u2019ve been able to tap into that with Emma \u2015 that she always feels like an outsider.\u201d\n\nThus far, Kinnunen said she\u2019s been overwhelmed by the response \u201cThe Prom\u201d has garnered, particularly from younger viewers who \u201cthink it\u2019s amazing to see themselves onstage in this character. It\u2019s heartbreaking, because these kids go through so much on a day-to-day basis that no one should ever have to go through.\u201d\n\nAs to how \u201cThe Prom\u201d will affect her work moving forward, she said she sees the show as \u201cthe next step in my journey of telling meaningful stories onstage.\u201d", "Astrid Stawiarz via Getty Images Hillary Clinton speaks at Glamour's Women of the Year awards on Monday.\n\nHillary Clinton shouted out to women candidates who \u201cwent all in\u201d for last week\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n\u201cFrom lifetime politicos to first-time candidates, busy, busy, people, busy executives and busy moms, women facing men and women facing each other, women went all in,\u201d the former secretary of state said during Glamour\u2019s Women of the Year awards on Monday night.\n\n\u201cWin or lose, their races really, energized us,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd encouraged even more Americans of all kinds to run for public office, to get civically involved.\u201d\n\nClinton, who lost to Trump in 2016, also reflected on how the country has changed since then.\n\n\u201cThis week, exactly two years ago, was a rough one,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut, you know, my personal disappointment wasn\u2019t so much about what happened, but how do we create even more opportunity for all the people in America. \u2018An America that\u2019s hopeful, inclusive and big-hearted,\u2019 as I said afterward.

He was captured, but prosecutors say he was undeterred from a brutal pursuit of power that lasted decades, featured jail breakouts and left a trail of bodies.\n\nThe story of the botched assassination will be part of an epic tale told in a tightly secured New York City courtroom starting Tuesday as prosecutors and defense lawyers make their opening statements in Guzman\u2019s long-awaited U.S. trial.\n\nGuzman, who has been held in solitary confinement since his extradition to the United States early last year, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he amassed a multi-billion-dollar fortune smuggling tons of cocaine and other drugs in a vast supply chain that reached New York, New Jersey, Texas and elsewhere north of the border.\n\nIf convicted, he faces a possible life prison sentence.\n\nProsecutors have said they will use thousands of documents, videos and recordings as evidence, including material related to the Guadalajara airport shooting, drug smugglers\u2019 safe houses, Guzman\u2019s 2015 prison escape and the law enforcement operation to recapture him.\n\nMore than a dozen cooperating witnesses are scheduled to testify, including some who worked for Guzman\u2019s Sinaloa cartel. Prosecutors say they risk retribution by taking the stand and the court has taken some steps to conceal their identities. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan barred courtroom sketch artists from drawing them.\n\nGuzman\u2019s lawyers are expected to attack the credibility of the witnesses by emphasizing their own criminal records, saying some have an incentive to lie to win leniency in their own cases.\n\nOne of Guzman\u2019s attorneys, Eduardo Balarezo, has suggested that he hopes to convince jurors Guzman wasn\u2019t actually in charge of the cartel but was a lieutenant taking orders from someone else.\n\n\u201cNow that trial is upon us, it is time to put up or shut up,\u201d Balarezo said.\n\nDespite his diminutive stature and nickname that means \u201cShorty,\u201d Guzman was once a larger-than-life figure in Mexico who has been compared to Al Capone and Robin Hood and been the subject of ballads called narcocorridos.\n\nAmong the highlights of his lore: how he was known for carrying a gold-plated AK-47; for smuggling cocaine in cans marked as jalape\u00f1os; for making shipments using planes with secret landing strips, container ships, speedboats and even submarines.\n\nBut Guzman is perhaps best known for escaping custody in Mexico, the first time in 2011 by hiding in the bottom of a laundry bin. He escaped again in 2015 through a mile-long tunnel dug into a shower in his jail cell that he slipped into before fleeing on a motorcycle.\n\nGuzman\u2019s second escape was a black eye for the Mexican government, an embarrassment amplified when the actor Sean Penn was able to find and interview him at one of his hideouts in Mexico while he was on the run from authorities.\n\nGuzman extradition to New York City shook up Mexico\u2019s drug underworld. Mexican security analyst Alejandro Hope said it created \u201csomething of a civil war within the Sinaloa cartel\u201d that has essentially ended with the arrest of internal rivals and allowed his sons to take control of what remains a \u201cweakened\u201d but far-from-finished smuggling operation.\n\nHope said he has seen no sign that Guzman\u2019s extradition and jailing in the U.S. had a major impact on drug flows or routes.\n\n\u201cBut symbolically I think it\u2019s important. It\u2019s a bit of an end of an era. There are very few kingpins of that size left, of that importance,\u201d Hope said. \u201cWe are actually leaving behind that era, the era of the kingpin.\u201d Smaller gangs now dominate, he said.\n\nRaul Benitez, a security expert and professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said Guzman\u2019s oversized myth has been fading, too.\n\nIn Mexico, news stories about Guzman\u2019s trial have been prominent in the media even though it\u2019s viewed by some as old history.\n\n\u201cHe is totally isolated. He cannot approach anyone. His wife was not even able to approach him. So he is now out of the game,\u201d Benitez said, referring to an order by the judge banning Guzman\u2019s wife from hugging him in the courtroom during the trial.\n\nWhether he is out for good will be decided by an anonymous jury of seven women and five men who will decide the case. The trial is expected to last into next year.", "SEATTLE \u2015 Amazon today announced that it has selected New York City and Arlington, Virginia, as the locations for the company\u2019s new headquarters.\n\nAmazon will invest $5 billion and create more than 50,000 jobs across the two new headquarters locations, with more than 25,000 employees each in New York City and Arlington.\n\nThe new locations will join Seattle as the company\u2019s three headquarters in North America.

Two-thirds of the year\u2019s victims were targeted for their race, ethnicity or ancestry, the report shows. Half of those crimes were borne of what the report calls \u201canti-black bias.\u201d\n\nSexual orientation and religion also were factors, and attacks on Jews accounted for nearly two-thirds of religion-based hate crimes.\n\nThe numbers show that the number of law enforcement agencies reporting hate crimes also rose in 2017. About 1,000 additional agencies contributed information for the report, compared with the previous year. Still, the sheer number of reported hate crimes is appalling no matter how you slice the data.\n\nThe release of the annual report follows a big month for hate in America. A far-right street gang attacked people on both coasts, a supporter of President Donald Trump sent pipe bombs to numerous critics of the president, an avowed anti-Semite killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue, and a man with a history racist and misogynistic comments killed two women at a Florida yoga studio.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks ago, we witnessed the most deadly anti-Semitic hate crime in American history. Today, we have another FBI study showing a big jump in hate crimes against Americans because of their race, religion, ethnicity, and sexual orientation,\u201d said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nGreenblatt added that the FBI report shows huge gaps in reporting. At least 92 cities with large populations either didn\u2019t report any data or claimed zero hate crimes, he noted in a statement.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t move what you can\u2019t measure,\u201d Greenblatt said. \u201cWithout accurate reporting we don\u2019t have a real sense of how widespread hate crimes are and what needs to be done to address bias in society.\u201d\n\nActing Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said the FBI report is a \u201ccall to action.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am particularly troubled by the increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes \u2015 which were already the most common religious hate crimes in the United States \u2015 that is well documented in this report,\u201d Whitaker said in a statement. \u201cThe American people can be assured that this Department has already taken significant and aggressive actions against these crimes and that we will vigorously and effectively defend their rights.\u201d", "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you.", "\u201cCNN filed a lawsuit against the Trump Administration this morning in DC District Court,\u201d the network said in a statement. \u201cIt demands the return of the White House credentials of CNN\u2019s Chief White House correspondent, Jim Acosta.

If there is no check on this type of behavior it impedes the ability of the President, the White House staff, and members of the media to conduct business.\u201d\n\nLast week, Acosta, who has frequently clashed with Trump and Sanders, got into a heated exchange with Trump during a news conference. The president admonished him as \u201ca rude, terrible person,\u201d one of several attacks and insults he hurled at reporters during the same news conference.\n\nLater that day, the White House press office revoked Acosta\u2019s \u201chard pass,\u201d which grants him entry to the White House grounds as a member of the White House press pool.\n\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters An intern moves to take the microphone from CNN's Jim Acosta during last week's press briefing. Later, the White House revoked Acosta's press pass.\n\nTo defend the decision, Sanders tweeted an apparently doctored video promoted by the right-wing conspiracy website Infowars, purporting to show Acosta physically assaulting the White House intern trying to take away the microphone he was using during the press conference.\n\nMany journalism and press advocacy organizations defended Acosta and condemned the White House for its decision, one of a number of ways Trump and his administration have regularly fomented animosity against the press and attempted to infringe on press freedom.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association said it \u201cstrongly supports\u201d Acosta and CNN\u2019s lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover them,\u201d WHCA President Olivier Knox said.\n\nIn a note to CNN employees, the network\u2019s president, Jeff Zucker, wrote that the lawsuit \u201cis not a step we have taken lightly.

Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), the primary supplier of medical care within the camps, was banned in March by the Myanmar government. Follow up attacks by Buddhist mobs on the homes of aid workers in Sittwe, put an end to NGO operations in the camps. Though some NGOs are beginning to resume work, MSF remains banned and little to no healthcare is being provided to most Rohingya IDPs. One Rohingya doctor is servicing 150,000 refugees with limited medication. Several Rakhine volunteer doctors sporadically enter the camps for two hours a day. Births are the most complicated procedures successfully carried out in the camps, requests to visit Yangon or Sittwe hospitals for life threatening situations require lengthy applications and are routinely denied. Malnutrition and diarrhea are the most widespread issues, but more serious diseases like tuberculosis are going untreated and could lead to the rise of drug resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB).

(Although power imbalances \u2014 and the ability to abuse them \u2014 do exist even when the sex has been consensual.)\u201d\n\nIn a new Vanity Fair essay published Tuesday, Lewinsky again examines this disparity in power as she explains why she decided to relive the painful memories of her experience for a forthcoming documentary series airing on A&E.\n\nCentral to her decision to participate was being able to redefine the narrative about herself, she wrote, noting how Clinton\u2019s position of power has allowed him to escape the same levels of public scrutiny.\n\nA recent example: Clinton\u2019s continued refusal to personally apologize to her and accept responsibility for contributing to her public humiliation, which he demonstrated during a combative interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show in June.\n\nThis summer, Clinton participated in a number of interviews to promote a book with author James Patterson. In several of them, the former president appeared to be caught off guard by questions about the Me Too movement and gave tone-deaf answers, despite Me Too bringing an increased focus on and a re-examination of his affair with Lewinsky, as well as the multiple sexual misconduct allegations against him.\n\nAs it so often does, power throws a protective cape around the shoulders of the man, and he dictates the spin by denigrating the less powerful woman.\" Monica Lewinsky\n\n\u201cIf you want to know what power looks like, watch a man safely, even smugly, do interviews for decades, without ever worrying whether he will be asked the questions he doesn\u2019t want to answer,\u201d Lewinsky wrote of Clinton.\n\nIn the \u201cToday\u201d interview, an indignant Clinton asserted to host Craig Melvin that he did not owe Lewinsky an apology. But Lewinsky wrote that the problem with his response was less about the apology directly and more about his insistence that he need not apologize.\n\n\u201cWhat feels more important to me than whether I am owed or deserving of a personal apology is my belief that Bill Clinton should want to apologize. I\u2019m less disappointed by him, and more disappointed for him,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe would be a better man for it ... and we, in turn, a better society.\u201d\n\nAnother example of the disparate power dynamic, according to Lewinsky, is how at the time of the affair, Clinton\u2019s position of power protected him from experiencing as much public humiliation as she did.\n\nRecalling his infamous Oval Office declaration that he \u201cdid not have sexual relations with that woman,\u201d which turned out to be a lie, she said that at the time, she thought it was good that he was not planning to resign.\n\n\u201cForty-five-year-old me sees that footage very differently,\u201d she wrote Tuesday. \u201cI see a sports coach signposting the playbook for the big game. Instead of backing down amid the swirling scandal and telling the truth, Bill instead threw down the gauntlet that day in the Oval Office: \u2018I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.\u2019 With that, the demonization of Monica Lewinsky began. As it so often does, power throws a protective cape around the shoulders of the man, and he dictates the spin by denigrating the less powerful woman.\u201d\n\nIn the essay, Lewinsky also explores how our public narratives are often shaped by men, as was the case with the coverage of her and Clinton\u2019s affair \u2014 \u201chistory literally being written by men,\u201d she wrote, explaining that she appreciated that the A&E docuseries \u201cembodies a woman\u2019s gaze,\u201d with a majority of the editors and producers being women.", "Hey #Trump...u don\u2019t understand.

Of course, a family\u2019s cultural and religious background may steer the discussion, but there are certain guiding principles that are helpful for everyone to keep in mind.\n\nHere are some expert suggestions for parents and caregivers when they prepare to talk about death and grief with children.\n\nBe Honest And Straightforward\n\n\u201cTell them the \u2018facts\u2019 about the death,\u201d clinical psychologist John Mayer told HuffPost. \u201cDon\u2019t sugarcoat what death is or use \u2018baby talk\u2019 with a child. Do not use phrases like, \u2018Grammy is sleeping.\u2019 This is an opportune time to teach them about death. Don\u2019t shy away from it.\u201d\n\nBoard certified licensed professional counselor Tammy Lewis Wilborn echoed this sentiment, noting that using \u201ccutesy language\u201d and euphemisms in an attempt to protect kids from the realities of death and loss can actually do more harm than good.\n\nkali9 via Getty Images Avoid using euphemisms when explaining death to children.\n\n\u201cChildren tend to think concretely, not abstractly, so when you use language that\u2019s euphemistic, it can actually be more confusing or frustrating,\u201d she explained. When people say things like \u201cDad is in the clouds\u201d or \u201cYour dad is taking a really long nap,\u201d a young child may not understand the permanence of the fact that their father died and might even look for him in the clouds or expect him to wake up at some point.\n\nWords like \u201cdeath,\u201d \u201cdied\u201d or \u201cdying\u201d may sound harsh, but this is still developmentally appropriate language, Wilborn noted, and it\u2019s important for children to have the language to understand the permanence of death.\n\nAsk And Answer Questions\n\nThe kind of conversation a parent has with a child following the death of a loved one depends on the child\u2019s relationship with the person who died. It should also vary based on the child\u2019s developmental age and their understanding of what happens when someone dies. To that end, it\u2019s useful to ask kids questions or offer to answer any questions they might have.\n\n\u201cStarting with questions can be a way in,\u201d said Wilborn. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t necessarily need to give the specific details of how the person died, particularly if we\u2019re dealing with traumatic grief. They don\u2019t need all of the information, but they need enough age-appropriate details to understand that a person has died and isn\u2019t coming back.\u201d\n\n\u201cParents should try to shrink themselves down to the size of their child and walk through what they\u2019ve experienced.\u201d\n\nSometimes children may have witnessed something related to the loved one\u2019s death, like being present at the scene of an accident or visiting the person in the hospital. In these cases, they need help understanding what they saw, said Chandra Ghosh Ippen, an expert in early childhood trauma and the associate director of the Child Trauma Research Program at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nParents should try to shrink themselves down to the size of their child and walk through what they\u2019ve experienced. Seeing someone in a hospital with tubes coming out of them or watching paramedics perform lifesaving procedures may be frightening for a small child, so it\u2019s necessary for adults to appreciate how scary things might look to them.\n\n\u201cCreate space for them to share how it might\u2019ve affected them, and try to help them understand that doctors and paramedics were trying to help their loved one,\u201d Ghosh Ippen explained.\n\nsot via Getty Images Know that the conversation around death and grieving will be ongoing.\n\nIt\u2019s an ongoing conversation. \u201cYoung children will often come back to you after your very excellent explanation of death and still ask, \u2018Am I going to see so-and-so?\u2019\u201d Ghosh Ippen said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they didn\u2019t understand you, but little kids tend to repeat their questions. It\u2019s sort of their way of mulling it over and making meaning. This can be painful for caregivers, but appreciate that the child did hear you and is just having a difficult time wrapping their head around the concept of death.\u201d\n\nKnow That Their Emotions Are Complicated\n\n\u201cGrief is a complex process, so it comes with a range of thoughts, emotions and behaviors,\u201d Wilborn explained. While parents may expect their child to feel sad, angry, confused or even guilty about a loss, there are other behavioral changes that can be harder to understand, like changes in sleeping and eating patterns or school performance issues.\n\nSometimes parents may feel confused about a perceived lack of sadness in their kids. \u201cYoung children have a short sadness span,\u201d said Ghosh Ippen. \u201cA child can suffer a devastating loss and feel really sad, and then they can go play. You may be thinking, \u2018Were they really affected by what happened?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile adults tend to immobilize and sink into sadness, kids often discharge it by running around or trying to do something else. \u201cThey kind of go in and out of sadness, and that can put us at odds with them if we\u2019re thinking, \u2018Oh, my God, do they not care?\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cBut recognize that they did care.\u201d\n\n\u201cA child can suffer a devastating loss and feel really sad, and then they can go play. You may be thinking, \u2018Were they really affected by what happened?\u2019\u201d - Chandra Ghosh Ippen, associate director of the Child Trauma Research Program at the University of California, San Francisco\n\nBe Patient\n\nWilborn noted that grief is a long process, so parents should reject the tendency to want to rush past it and wonder when their kids are going to be over it.\n\n\u201cGrief is a process that you cannot go around. You have to go through it. So you need to be OK with the pace of the process,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can take some time for a child to return to his or her normal.\u201d\n\nMayer emphasized the power of this experience and of talking to kids about death as a way to build major developmental coping skills. \u201cThis is a positive and helps them cope with loss in their life in the future and even transitions in their life, such as leaving one school to another, advancing to high school or college, and losing relationships.\u201d\n\nEncourage Expression\n\n\u201cChildren need to see that their parents are a resource; home is a resource where grief is welcome,\u201d Wilborn said, noting that parents should encourage age-appropriate expressions of grief.\n\n\u201cFor example with a school-aged, play is their language, so you want to lean into ways that children play to promote communication \u2015 things like drawing pictures, playing games, dolls, puppet shows at home,\u201d she added. \u201cWith older kids, you might encourage them to journal, draw, write songs, create poems.\u201d\n\nMayer noted that being a resource for your child creates a sense of safety and security that will serve them in later life events. \u201cThey know they can depend on you, and it is wonderful modeling for them.\u201d\n\nCreate Rituals\n\nCreating rituals around remembering and honoring a loved one who died is another significant form of expression. \u201cExplain that this person may not be here with us, but we can still remember him or her and celebrate their life as a family,\u201d said Wilborn.\n\n\u201cWhen the death is really traumatic, sometimes caregivers stop talking about the person who died,\u201d Ghosh Ippen explained. \u201cAnd what\u2019s hard in those cases is that children lose their \u2018angel memories\u2019 \u2015 times when they really felt loved and cared for with that person. It\u2019s normal for grown-ups in mourning to find it hard to talk about the person who died, but it\u2019s important to memorialize them.\u201d\n\nasiseeit via Getty Images Losing a loved one offers an opportunity to talk to your child about your cultural and religious beliefs.\n\nMany cultures and religions promote rituals around saying goodbye and making meaning of death. Mayer noted that losing a loved one presents an opportunity for parents who have religious belief systems to explain these tenets to their children.\n\n\u201cReligious or not, it is also very helpful to teach your children that all the experiences and memories you have had with this loved one do not get erased with their death. People always live in our hearts and our minds forever, and no one or nothing can take that away,\u201d he explained. \u201cSay something like, \u2018Where\u2019s Aunt Susie right now? She\u2019s not in this room with us right now, correct? That doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t exist.\u2019 Aunt Susie is here (point to your head) and here (point to your heart). We have to keep our memories and good times with Aunt Susie alive.\u201d\n\nMake Sure They Know It\u2019s Not Their Fault\n\n\u201cSometimes children have this really uncanny way of assigning blame to themselves for things that have nothing to do with them,\u201d said Wilborn.\n\nWith that in mind, caregivers need to help kids understand that the death is in no way their fault, and it\u2019s not their responsibility to put on a strong face or hide their feelings.\n\n\u201cReligious or not, it is also very helpful to teach your children that all the experiences and memories you have had with this loved one do not get erased with their death. People always live in our hearts and our minds forever, and no one or nothing can take that away.\u201d - clinical psychologist John Mayer\n\nUse Books And Other Resources\n\nThere are many great resources for parents navigating this difficult topic with their children. Ghosh Ippen and Wilborn both recommend Sesame Street\u2019s online grief toolkit, which provides talking points, videos, activities, storybooks and more. Ghosh Ippen and Wilborn also pointed to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network as another great source of online resources.\n\nLittle, Brown Books for Young Readers There are many children's books that cover the experience of loss.\n\nBeyond books and online resources, Wilborn emphasized the value of community resources, such as school counseling, support groups, play therapy and peer counseling.\n\nLet Them See You Grieve\n\nThe way a child\u2019s parents or caregivers respond to a loss is instrumental in helping them cope. \u201cThey need to see you grieve,\u201d said Wilborn. \u201cBut they also need to see you taking care of yourself and engaging in self-care, which may or may not include professional help. If you don\u2019t, they may feel like they have to take care of you because you\u2019re not managing grief in a way that\u2019s healthy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s OK to cry in front of your children and show the value of expressing emotions and having shared emotions among family members. It\u2019s OK to say things like \u201cI\u2019m feeling really sad because my dad died\u201d or \u201cDaddy is sad because he misses his mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin our culture, we often have a sense that we have to be tough, so many parents are trying to help their kids by putting on a brave or overly cheery face,\u201d said Ghosh Ippen. \u201cBut that can seem really odd and confusing. The child is feeling sad because it\u2019s devastating that this person is gone, but then the parent is cheery \u2015 which can feel eerie and weird.\u201d\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s about conveying the idea that \u201cMom is sad, and Mom is also strong,\u201d she continued. If the feelings of grief become overwhelming, parents should seek help from other sources because it\u2019s not their child\u2019s role to help them.", "Lyla is a pug, a very popular type of dog. She\u2019s also a vegan. Her owner has stopped feeding her meat, a decision becoming more common among pet owners in the U.S. as people\u2019s rising interest in meatless diets spreads to their pets.\n\nLyla belongs to Myron Lyskanycz, CEO of the pet food company Halo. The business has sold both meat and vegan ranges of pet food for six years, and its meat-free products now account for 20 percent of dog food sales. Lyskanycz predicts vegan sales will grow quickly over the next decade.\n\nAround 8 percent of Americans describe themselves as vegetarian or vegan, according to one poll, and an additional 31 percent say they actively reduce their meat consumption, according to another. As people move away from meat, said Lyskanycz, \u201cthey are going to begin to see it is suitable for their pets too. It\u2019s inevitable.\u201d\n\nHalo Pets Lyla the vegan pug.\n\nA plant-based diet for dogs is not as ridiculous as it might seem. In the U.S., the 70 million dogs kept as companions largely eat meat-based diets. If you put all the American dogs, cats and other pets on their own island, they would rank fifth in global meat consumption, behind Russia, Brazil, the U.S. and China.\n\nThis has started worrying environmentalists, with global meat and dairy production representing 14.5 percent of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions \u2015 slightly more than the emissions produced by every car, train, aircraft and ship on the planet. Pet dogs and cats are responsible for up to 30 percent of the environmental impact of animal agriculture in the U.S.\n\nWithout cutting the overconsumption of meat \u2015 in pets, as well as humans \u2015 it will be almost impossible to prevent global warming from passing the danger level of a 2 degrees Celsius temperature rise (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nFree-ranging dogs in other countries that survive by scavenging have been found to consume a diet rich in carbohydrates (biscuits, bread, rice) and relatively low in protein (scraps of meat or remains of carcasses).\n\nDomestic dogs are reported to be better adapted to a diet that is higher in carbohydrates than their wolf-like ancestors because of changes in foraging behavior and a better ability to digest starch. This is supported by a Swedish study that found dogs were five times better at digesting starch \u2015 found in grains, beans and potatoes \u2015 than wolves, and had a digestive enzyme similar to one found in herbivores such as cows and rabbits.\n\nWhile dogs like the smell and taste of meat, the study says, the diet given to them as puppies is likely to strongly influence their taste preferences as an adult dog.\n\n\u201cMost people who own a dog have never thought a dog could survive on a plant-based diet. As more information comes out, that will change,\u201d said Lyskanycz.\n\nMuch of the pet food available today includes bone meal and other leftovers of animals less popular in human diets. But Greg Okin, a professor at the University of California and author of a study on the environmental impact of pet food, said there is a move by some pet food companies to persuade pet owners to buy food made from higher quality meat.\n\n\u201cMarketers are attempting to convince consumers that their dogs are wolves and that their cats are lions and, therefore, must have high-animal content diets,\u201d Okin said. \u201cDogs aren\u2019t wolves and cats aren\u2019t lions. But people are suckers. In my opinion, they\u2019re being duped into spending more money on products their animal doesn\u2019t need and that, from an environmental perspective, is worse than the cheaper grain-filled brands.\u201d\n\nThat said, there are limits to switching pets away from a meat-based diet. While dogs can live on a diet of vegetables, cats are carnivores and need certain nutrients within meat in their diet.\n\nOlyaSolodenko via Getty Images Cats are carnivores and need nutrients in their diet which they get from meat.\n\nDogs \u201care omnivores and even their wild ancestors had vegetables in their diet. They have since become more suited with evolution for a plant-based diet,\u201d said Dr. Sarah Dodd, a veterinary consultant to companies including Halo who is studying plant-based pet diets. \u201dWith cats, it\u2019s different. On paper you can get all the nutrients in a plant-based diet with formulation, but we do not yet have enough evidence to know if the products currently on offer meet those needs.\u201d\n\nDodd said large pet food companies should support further research about products for cats. One such company, Mars Petcare, whose brands include Pedigree, Iams, Nutro and Eukanuba, has doubts about consumer interest in vegan pet food.\n\n\u201cWhile a vegan diet for cats and dogs is possible, it can be difficult to develop,\u201d Dr. Tiffany Bierer, scientific affairs manager at Mars Petcare, said. \u201cFor example, dogs and cats require Vitamin D in their diets to maintain proper calcium levels in their body. Unlike humans, they can\u2019t produce it on their own, and Vitamin D is only found in animal-based foods. There are also some nutrients that have limited vegetable or grain sources, like amino acids.\u201d\n\nAnother pet food company is addressing the cat problem with slaughter-free meat. California-based Wild Earth, whose backers include billionaire Peter Thiel, says it wants to reinvent pet food with slaughter-free or lab-grown meat, as well as plant-based food.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using plants and fungi, which is very high in protein, as a first step in replacing meat,\u201d said CEO Ryan Bethencourt. \u2033But we don\u2019t advertise ourselves as a vegan company. Our purpose is to create sustainable protein, which could include slaughter-free.\u201d\n\nWild Earth has already made a slaughter-free mouse meat for cats, though it\u2019s not yet available for sale. Bethencourt said a commercial meat product for humans is likely to come first, to avoid creating an image of lab-grown meat as a substandard human food option.\n\n\u201cWe could do it today or within a few months, but it\u2019s a regulatory and price question,\u201d Bethencourt said, adding that Wild Earth hopes to begin selling a lab meat product by 2020.\n\nFor the time being, Okin said pet owners shouldn\u2019t change companion\u2019s diet without guidance.\n\n\u201cMuch as we make decisions about what car to drive \u2015 some of us based on considerations of carbon emissions \u2015 we also might choose what kind of animal to keep based on its need for animal-derived products,\u201d Okin said. \u201cFor people who have animals, I encourage them to talk to their vet about this if they have questions.\u201d\n\nFor more content and to be part of the This New World community, follow our Facebook page.", "Grab the tissues.

Palestinian officials say at least four people, including two militants, have been killed. In Israel, at least 20 people have also been wounded, several seriously.\n\nIt is the most intense exchange of fire since the 2014 Gaza war pic.twitter.com/SAc4MKUWzE \u2014 HuffPost UK (@HuffPostUK) November 13, 2018\n\nThe military said jets struck several \u201ckey strategic\u201d Hamas targets, including military compounds, rocket launching posts and part of its vast underground tunnel network. Also targeted was a Gaza City building serving Hamas\u2019 military and intelligence forces that houses a munition warehouse.\n\nThe armed wing of Hamas threatened to step up its attacks and fire rockets further north toward the Israeli cities of Ashdod and Beersheba if Israel continued its airstrikes.\n\nThe spokesman for the Hamas military wing, identified only as Abu Obeida, said the deadly attack on the coastal city of Ashkelon showed the city \u201chas entered the range of fire as a response to the bombing of buildings in Gaza.\u201d He said Ashdod and Beersheba \u201care the next targets if the enemy continues bombing civilian buildings.\u201d\n\nSchool has been cancelled in large parts of southern Israel and a local election has been postponed because of the threat of further attacks.\n\nOver the past few months, the sides have come close to a major escalation several times, only to step back in favor of giving a chance to a long-term Egyptian mediated truce.\n\nHowever, the current level of escalation and angry rhetoric, including Hamas\u2019 warnings to strike deeper inside Israel, might make it more difficult to restore calm.\n\nThe Israeli security Cabinet began meeting to discuss the next steps, as the United Nations appealed for calm.\n\nThe deadly rocket strike came before dawn in the Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon. The Magen David Adom medical service said a man in his 40s was found dead under the rubble of a building in Ashkelon.\n\nHe was the first casualty in Israel from the current wave. The man was later identified as a man from Hebron, the West Bank\u2019s largest Palestinian city.\n\nThe eruption of fighting cast doubt over recent understandings brokered by Egypt and U.N. officials to reduce tensions. Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had defended those understandings, saying he was doing everything possible to avoid another war. But he will now be under intense pressure to retaliate given Hamas\u2019 unrelenting rocket barrages.\n\nThe rocket fire was triggered by a botched Israeli military raid in Gaza on Sunday. Undercover troops, apparently on a reconnaissance mission, were discovered inside Gaza, setting off a battle that left seven militants, including a Hamas commander, and a senior Israeli military officer dead. Hamas then fired a guided missile that struck a bus from which soldiers had just disembarked, marking an upgrade over its typical inaccurate projectiles.\n\nThe strike set the bus on fire, sending a large plume of black smoke over the area. A 19-year-old soldier was critically wounded and rocket attacks and Israeli retaliation fire quickly ensued.\n\nThe airstrikes and rocket barrages resumed at dawn Tuesday after nearly two hours of calm.\n\nLt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said Israeli warplanes, tanks and naval vessels were involved in strikes against military compounds, observation posts and weapons facilities belonging to the two main Gaza militant groups behind the attacks \u2014 Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.\n\nHe said the Israeli military has enhanced its deployment along the border but had yet to mobilize its reserves. He said Gaza militant groups were believed to have an arsenal in excess of 20,000 rockets and mortars of different caliber and range.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have fought three wars since the Islamic militant group seized control of Gaza from the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. In the most recent war, over 2,200 Palestinians were killed, more than half of them civilians, and tens of thousands were left homeless. Seventy-three people, most of them soldiers, were killed on the Israeli side.\n\nIsrael and Egypt have maintained a blockade on Gaza since the Hamas takeover. The blockade has devastated Gaza\u2019s economy.\n\nIn recent weeks, Egyptian and U.N. mediators had appeared to make progress in brokering informal understandings aimed at quieting the situation.\n\nLast week, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million to Gaza to allow cash-strapped Hamas to pay the salaries of thousands of government workers.

When they finally piled into their Subaru Outback, Wahl and Shroyer realized they didn\u2019t know where they were escaping to \u2014 or even where exactly the fires were.\n\nFour days later, Wahl and Shroyer were among more than 150,000 California residents who have been displaced by fires raging across the state. Even in a drought-ridden region under near-constant threat of burning down \u2014 just last year, a wildfire burned over 280,000 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties \u2014 the speed, intensity and unpredictability with which the flames spread took Southern Californians by surprise.\n\nJessica Schulberg/HuffPost Sandy Wahl's dogs at the Thousand Oaks Teen Center.\n\nIn the midst of the chaos, so much of evading the rapidly spreading flames depends on chance. On Thursday, Wahl\u2019s landline was disconnected and her computer was turned off because she was doing work on her house \u2014 causing her to miss evacuation notices. She learned days later that the fire burned some of the homes on her cul-de-sac but left her house unscathed. As of Monday evening, the Woolsey fire had killed two people and destroyed 435 structures, had burned more than 90,000 acres and was only 30 percent contained. Mandatory evacuations remained in place in parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. A separate fire raging in Northern California has killed at least 42 people, making it the deadliest in the state\u2019s history.\n\nMany of the displaced in Los Angeles who don\u2019t have friends or family nearby are stranded in makeshift shelters operated by the Red Cross and other volunteers that have been set up in schools and community centers throughout the region.\n\nWally Skalij/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Horses are tied to a pole on a Malibu beach as heavy smoke from the Woolsey fire comes down the coastal hillsides Friday.\n\nWahl\u2019s roommate at the shelter at the Thousands Oaks Teen Center, 68-year-old Faye Rosenberg, was too shocked to think straight when she arrived Friday. She hadn\u2019t unpacked from a trip to New York, where she attended a memorial service for her sister, and she was worried about her two cats, one of which has a kidney disease.\n\nBut she was quickly overwhelmed by the care she \u2014 and her cats \u2014 received.\n\nLocal residents whose homes had been spared and staffers at the teen center \u2014 where families of victims of a mass shooting had gathered the day before the fire \u2014 helped Red Cross volunteers house hundreds of evacuees. They provided food, cots, blankets, nurses and mental health workers. Rosenberg became friendly with Wahl and Shroyer, who crammed into a small room they shared with their pets and two guinea pigs. When volunteers noticed Rosenberg wasn\u2019t eating because she keeps kosher, the Red Cross found her tofu, fruit and uncooked vegetables.\n\nIn Calabasas, about 15 miles east of the teen center, locals poured into the shelter at Pierce College offering their time, supplies and even their homes. The college, which has an equestrian center, attracted displaced pets from all over the area. In the check-in area, a tortoise clawed at the door to its crate, feet away from a napping pug and a French bulldog. Volunteers near the parking lot collected pet food, crates and leashes.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, evacuees were getting antsy to go back home \u2014 or at least make a quick visit at their house to change clothes and pick up items they forgot to bring. The air was still smoky, but the skies looked clearer than they had over the weekend. Los Angeles Fire Department officials rotated through evacuation sites to provide updates, maps and websites and to urge people to stay in place. Smoldering hills and strong winds could cause unexpected flare-ups in areas where the flames had died down, Los Angeles Fire Department Capt.

Stan Lee, the visionary pioneer behind the Marvel Comics universe, has been in more films than all of them combined.\n\nLee died on Monday at the age of 95, but his much celebrated cameos likely haven\u2019t ended, judging from an interview that \u201cAvengers\u201d co-director Joe Russo gave earlier this year. Speaking with the BBC in April just before the release of \u201cAvengers: Infinity War,\u201d Russo noted that Lee didn\u2019t enjoy flying so Marvel productions that were shooting in similar locations would often film his cameos together.\n\n\u201cTypically we try to get him out \u2014 he doesn\u2019t love to fly \u2014 so we try to get him out for his cameos around the same time,\u201d Russo told the BBC. \u201cSo if we have other movies shooting on the same lot that we\u2019re on, for instance Ant-Man 2 or Avengers 4, we group his cameos together and then move him from one set to the next and kind of get him through his cameos in one day.\u201d\n\nRusso and his brother, Anthony, are co-directing the fourth \u201cAvengers\u201d film, set to be released in May 2019. The film has reportedly already finished shooting.\n\nLee has acting credits in more than 120 films, according to IMDb, including credited roles as a hot dog vendor in 2000\u2019s \u201cX-Men,\u201d a security guard in 2003\u2019s \u201cHulk\u201d and a man mistaken for Hugh Hefner in 2008\u2019s \u201cIron Man.\u201d He\u2019s also saved several characters \u2015 from falling debris (2002\u2032s \u201cSpider-Man\u201d), walking in front of a truck (2003\u2032s \u201cDaredevil\u201d) and plummeting pieces of concrete (2004\u2032s \u201cSpider-Man 2\u201d).\n\nLee helped create many of the world\u2019s most recognized superheroes, including Iron Man, the Hulk and the X-Men, during his decadeslong career in the comic book industry. He was also responsible for vaulting Marvel Comics into the mainstream, and he served as the ambassador for the entertainment behemoth for decades, even after he stepped away from day-to-day operations.\n\nHis cameos have been a staple of almost every major Marvel movie since the reinvention of the Hollywood franchise, which The New York Times notes had grossed more than $24 billion worldwide as of April this year. The most recent \u201cAvengers\u201d film became the first superhero movie to net more than $2 billion.", "After a delay in ballot counting following last week\u2019s midterm election, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema was officially announced as the winner of Arizona\u2019s Senate race on Monday. She becomes the state\u2019s first female U.S. senator.\n\nSinema defeated Republican Martha McSally, who was leading on Wednesday with 790,911 votes to Sinema\u2019s 768,737, with about 75 percent of precincts reporting. By Monday, the nearly 1 million remaining ballots were finally counted, and Sinema emerged on top.\n\nIn a victory speech on Monday evening, Sinema framed her win as a move away from \u201cpetty\u201d politics.\n\n\u201cArizona proved there\u2019s a better way forward,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can work with people that are different than us ... We can embrace difference while seeking common ground.\u201d\n\nIn a Twitter post, McSally said she had called Sinema to congratulate her. \u201cI wish her all success as she represents Arizona in the Senate,\u201d McSally said.\n\nCongrats to @kyrstensinema. I wish her success. I\u2019m grateful to all those who supported me in this journey.

Jeff Flake. Arizona was set to get its first female senator regardless of the election\u2019s outcome, and both candidates are barrier-breakers in their own rights.\n\nSinema made history in 2012 when she became the nation\u2019s first openly bisexual member of Congress. McSally is a retired Air Force colonel and was the first female fighter pilot to fly in combat.\n\nThe race for the Senate seat was exceptionally close and was viewed as crucial to Democrats\u2019 chances of taking back the U.S. Senate, but losses for a handful of Democratic incumbents ended that possibility. Arizona is a former Republican bastion \u2015 home to Barry Goldwater, the founder of the modern conservative movement \u2015 that has slowly emerged as a swing state in recent years, due in part to a steady rise in Latino voters.\n\nThe contest largely centered on health care, an issue of primary importance particularly to the more than 1 million Arizonans who have a pre-existing health condition. In the lead-up to the midterm election, Sinema and Democratic groups emphasized McSally\u2019s votes to repeal protections for pre-existing conditions in the Affordable Care Act. McSally\u2019s campaign approach was primarily to turn voters\u2019 attention to Sinema\u2019s past and ideology, especially her activism against the Iraq War.\n\nEven with Sinema\u2019s win, Republicans will still hold control of the Senate but at a slightly smaller margin. Several other races remain up in the air. Florida\u2019s Senate race between Republican Rick Scott and Democrat incumbent Bill Nelson is approaching a recount deadline on Thursday. The Senate race in Mississippi advanced to a runoff after neither Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith nor Democrat Mike Espy garnered more than 50 percent of the vote.", "It goes without saying that Stan Lee, who died Monday at the age of 95, had a phenomenal impact on our world. Our cultural imagination is richer for his having lived, and so are Disney\u2019s shareholders. But this is only part of his story. Lee was also one of the masterminds of the Marvel Universe, the interlinked fictional world in which Marvel comics \u2014 and now Marvel movies and TV shows \u2014 unfold.\n\nAnd this made us wonder: Which of Lee\u2019s creations have had the largest impact? Not on our world but on his. Which characters\u2019 actions have been felt the most widely across the Marvel\u2019s multiverse, all the way from Earth-1 through Earth-616 (the main continuity in which the comics take place) to Earth-555326? Who sits at the center of the Marvel Universe?\n\nWe decided to figure it out.\n\nTo do so, we took the Marvel Database \u2014 think Wikipedia but for people who spent their adolescent Wednesday nights at Weasel\u2019s Comic Vault \u2014 and downloaded data on all 54,000 characters included there. It turns out that Lee is listed as having created or co-created 1,082 of them.\n\nBut how can we figure out who is important? To do this, we stole a trick from Google. The way Google decides the importance of a page is by looking at the number of other pages linking to it. Likewise, we counted the number of connections each character has to other characters. So, for example, if Peter Parker went on a trip to Titan with Tony Stark and it merited a mention on his character biography, that would count as a connection. From this we derived an impact score, i.e., the number of other character pages linking to a character, plus the number of links on that character\u2019s page linking to other characters.\n\nTo be clear, this was a text-based analysis and obviously relies on the precision of detail in the Marvel Database; some errors may have slipped through, despite the admirable rigor that has gone into the site\u2019s maintenance. Another potential limitation of the data is that characters are either tagged as a Lee co-creation or not \u2014 which explains some of the more unexpected appearances on the list, such as Jessica Jones, in whose creation Lee was only a relatively peripheral figure. The Tony Stark of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Earth-199999) doesn\u2019t factor in our list because that iteration of the character wasn\u2019t created by Lee, at least not in the eyes of the Marvel wiki.\n\nWith those caveats out of the way, here is our list of the 100 most important Lee characters in the Marvel Universe, ranked in ascending order of importance. (The full list can be found here.) If you have an issue with the ranking, well, take it up with Lee and Google.\n\nName Impact Debut 100. Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616) 96 1965 99.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 An associate of longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone said Monday that he expects to face charges in the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nConservative conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi said on his YouTube show that negotiations fell apart with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team and he expects in the coming days to be charged with making false statements.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be indicted,\u201d Corsi said on his show. \u201cThat\u2019s what we were told. Everyone should know that, and I\u2019m anticipating it.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press couldn\u2019t immediately confirm Corsi\u2019s claims that charges against him are forthcoming. Corsi\u2019s attorney, David Gray, declined to comment Monday evening. A spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office also declined to comment.\n\nCorsi is one of several Stone associates who have been questioned by investigators as Mueller probes Stone\u2019s connections with WikiLeaks. American intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian agents were the source of hacked material released by WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign, including emails belonging to former Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. And Mueller\u2019s office is trying to determine whether Stone and other associates of President Donald Trump had advance knowledge of WikiLeaks\u2019 plans.\n\nCorsi, the former Washington bureau chief of the conspiracy theory outlet InfoWars, said Monday that he had no recollection of ever meeting WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.\n\n\u201cTo the best of my recollection, what I knew in advance about what Julian Assange was going to do in terms of having the Podesta emails, I figured out,\u201d he said.\n\nCorsi said Monday that he has been cooperating with the Mueller investigation since receiving a subpoena in late August. He said he gave investigators two computers, a cell phone and access to his email accounts and tweets.\n\nBut he said talks with investigators recently had \u201cblown up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fully anticipate that in the next few days, I will be indicted by Mueller,\u201d he said, as he made a pitch for donations to his legal defense fund.\n\nStone, who has also said he expects to be indicted, has denied being a conduit for WikiLeaks, which published thousands of emails stolen from Podesta in the weeks before the election.", "On Thursday night, two days after Election Day, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) stood on the steps of the governor\u2019s mansion in Tallahassee and unleashed a nuclear bomb aimed at the very foundation of democracy. Scott suggested there was \u201crampant fraud\u201d in the state. \u201cNo ragtag group of liberal activists or lawyers from D.C.\u201d was going to steal the election from Floridians, the governor said.\n\nWhen Scott made his comments, Florida hadn\u2019t even hit the deadline to submit unofficial election results to the state. Scott asked the state\u2019s law enforcement agency to investigate his allegations, but the agency quickly said there was nothing to investigate.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped President Donald Trump from continuing to insist that there was fraud in the state. There is no evidence of fraud to support his claim.\n\nScott\u2019s election night lead over Nelson has shrunk significantly, and the margin is now so slim that the state is in the midst of a legally required recount. But election experts say there\u2019s nothing unusual or nefarious about vote tallies changing days after an election. Instead of letting election officials count the ballots as usual, the comments from Scott and Trump amount to an effort to undermine normal election processes.\n\nSteven Huefner, a law professor at Ohio State University, wrote that it was \u201cbeyond unseemly\u201d and \u201cdownright destructive of public trust in our elections\u201d for election officials to attribute changing vote totals to nefarious actions.\n\nFlorida allows voters to cast ballots by mail and accepts them until 7 p.m. on Election Day. Election officials then have to verify signatures on the ballots in addition to determining whether provisional ballots cast on Election Day can count. That process can take time, which is why Florida and other states give counties time to conduct what\u2019s called a canvass and review the votes. In Florida, the deadline for counties to submit unofficial results to the state was Saturday and the deadline for official results is Nov. 18.\n\n\u201cResults on election night, it\u2019s actually never been final on election night. Ever in the history of our country. There\u2019s always been this continuation of calculating the results and all that,\u201d said Amber McReynolds, the former top elections official in Denver who is now the executive director of the National Vote at Home Institute, a group that advocates for voting by mail. \u201cThis is not new. Florida\u2019s doing exactly what other states are doing right now. California has even more to count. But in California, there\u2019s not a Republican that might win, so it\u2019s not getting any attention.\u201d\n\nCharles Stewart, the director of the MIT Election Lab, noted that, in addition to trying to deal with mailed-in ballots, counties also had to tally their early votes. Florida law doesn\u2019t allow officials to count early votes until after the polls have closed. Different counties may also tally at different speeds because of the equipment available, the kinds of ballots they receive and staffing, experts say.\n\nScott has complained that Brenda Snipes, the supervisor of elections in Broward County, refused to turn over information about how many ballots still needed to be tallied. He secured a court order on Friday requiring her to hand over the information.\n\nNed Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University, has studied the way that vote totals change during a canvass after Election Day. Those shifts tend to benefit Democrats and are a \u201crelatively new phenomenon,\u201d he said, because more people are voting by mail and Congress passed a law in 2002 requiring officials to offer provisional ballots.\n\n\u201cBoth of those things have the effect of having ballots eligible to be counted but not available for counting on election night,\u201d he said. \u201cFor demographic reasons, groups that tend to vote Democratic Party \u2015 students, younger voters, more mobile voters \u2015 you\u2019re more likely to get caught up in the need for a provisional ballot if you\u2019re just a more transient population.\u201d\n\nUsually, shifts in vote counts after Election Day go unnoticed because they aren\u2019t enough to overcome the initially reported margin of victory. But in Florida, the changing tally is getting scrutinized because the margin separating the candidates is so thin, Foley said. A similar process is playing out in Arizona, where election officials are still counting the ballots in close races for U.S. Senate and secretary of state.\n\nCalifornia has even more to count. But in California, there\u2019s not a Republican that might win, so it\u2019s not getting any attention. Amber McReynolds, executive director of the National Vote at Home Institute\n\nTrump tweeted Monday that Florida shouldn\u2019t consider any of the votes tallied after election night, a move that would disenfranchise military voters whose ballots can be accepted until Nov. 16. Scott\u2019s campaign is also suing in state court to block officials in Broward County, a key bastion of Democratic votes, from officially counting any ballots that weren\u2019t tallied by the state\u2019s Saturday deadline for unofficial results.\n\nFoley said the allegations of fraud and election stealing in Florida were particularly worrisome because there could be shifts of tens of thousands of votes during a presidential election. The allegations in Florida could serve as a prelude for a candidate to undermine the results in 2020. A key part of democracies, he said, is that the candidates accept the results of elections as legitimate.\n\n\u201cEvery election has a winner and a loser, and the loser has to accept defeat,\u201d he said. The loser \u201chas to think that, even though they really wanted to win and thought they should have won \u2015 or maybe even thought the vote-counting process was inaccurate in some respects \u2015 that we can accept it.\u201d\n\nThe talk of fraud got the attention of the chief state judge in Broward County, who urged lawyers for both campaigns who were in court Monday to \u201cramp down the rhetoric\u201d about voter fraud.\n\nRichard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who specializes in elections, wrote in Slate that that kind of questioning of election results could lay the foundation for a constitutional crisis.", "President Donald Trump has signed two major pieces of legislation during his time in office: a tax cut favoring the very wealthy and a slate of perks for the banking industry. He owes the second achievement to a handful of Democrats, many of whom lost their jobs last Tuesday night.\n\nPublicly, the Democrats who wrote and co-sponsored the bank bill insisted it was a great way to help the vulnerable. It would \u201cprovide needed relief for community banks and credit unions so they can support consumers in rural areas,\u201d according to Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.). It included \u201ccommon sense fixes to assist small banks and give them the flexibility they need to lend,\u201d according to Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.).\n\nIn the president\u2019s words, it was \u201ca very, very important bill from the standpoint of people, and jobs and loans.\u201d\n\nFew members of Washington officialdom put much stock in any of this. There was no shortage of money to lend in the spring of 2018. Banks large and small were and are doing very well. In the first quarter of the year alone, the banking industry booked a combined profit of $56 billion, up from $43.9 billion the year before and nearly double its level from 2011, according to the FDIC. Not a single bank in the country has failed in all of 2018.\n\nPrivately, other Democrats on Capitol Hill offered a more plausible explanation for the vote. The bank bill could help Democrats in red states raise money for the November election. Most voters don\u2019t pay close attention to legislative fights over bank regulation, but bankers do, and they aren\u2019t shy about contributing to political campaigns. Ultimately, 16 Democratic senators and Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, voted for the bill.\n\nAnd indeed, the top four recipients of campaign cash from commercial banks in 2018 were authors or co-sponsors of the bank bill: Heitkamp received over $320,000 from the sector, followed by Sen. Jon Tester of Montana at nearly $275,000, McCaskill at $236,743 and Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana at $232,966, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. During election season, the Credit Union National Association advertised on behalf of all four. The American Bankers Association hit the airwaves for Tester starting in April.\n\nIt would be nice if doing the right thing were always good politics. But the reality is often more complex, and so it is with Democrats beholden to the financial sector. Some lost badly on Tuesday night; most survived. The lesson from the bank bill is not that selling out never pays off; it\u2019s that corporate money can\u2019t save senators who have nothing else to run on.\n\nWe can start with the midterm results that had bank lobbyists clinking Champagne glasses. Tester won by a respectable margin of 15,000 votes, about 3 percentage points. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) won by 19,000 votes, good for 4 points. Kyrsten Sinema, the most reliable pro-bank vote among House Democrats, appears to have won the party its first Senate seat in Arizona in 24 years. In Virginia \u2015 where Sen. Mark Warner barely escaped with a win in 2014, bank bill backer Tim Kaine trounced neo-Confederate Corey Stewart. Sen. Debbie Stabenow walloped her Republican challenger in Michigan by over a quarter of a million votes, and King took 14 of Maine\u2019s 16 counties en route to a nearly 20-point win. We don\u2019t yet know whether Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), another co-sponsor of the bank bill, will squeak out a victory or not, but it\u2019s going to be very close.\n\nAll of these Democrats voted for the bank bill. But it\u2019s also true that on Tuesday night, senators who voted their values did better than senators who voted with the American Bankers Association. Heitkamp, Donnelly and McCaskill were crushed, while Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Bob Casey (D-Pa.) \u2015 all representing states Trump won in 2016 \u2015 coasted to re-election after voting against the bank bill, with both Baldwin and Brown outperforming other Democrats running for governor in their states.\n\nIn the vast majority of races, the bank bill seemed to have been electorally irrelevant. Kaine, Stabenow and King didn\u2019t need the bank money to win, and neither did Brown, Baldwin and Casey. McCaskill, Donnelly and Heitkamp weren\u2019t close in their losses. That leaves Tester, Sinema and Nelson as still-undecided races where, perhaps, advertising support from the financial sector played a meaningful role.\n\nWas it worth it? Democrats in Washington still debate exactly how bad the bank bill was, but it\u2019s hard to argue that it didn\u2019t do active harm. The new law makes it cheaper and easier for large banks to merge (so long as they don\u2019t break a $250 billion threshold) and, according to the Congressional Budget Office, increases the risk of a financial crisis by reducing regulatory oversight of large regional banks.\n\nRepublicans didn\u2019t have the votes to enact these big projects without Democratic support, and instead of asking for offsetting liberal items, red-state Democrats demanded additional GOP-friendly provisions in exchange for their votes. One provision authored by Donnelly benefits billionaire Warren Buffett by eliminating consumer protections in the mobile home industry. Heitkamp secured an item attacking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s ability to police racial discrimination in the mortgage market.\n\nHeitkamp and Donnelly have typically voted the party line on major bills when party leadership has demanded it. These votes send important signals to constituents, but they rarely matter for legislative outcomes. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed without their support; Trump\u2019s tax bill passed despite their opposition. The bank bill was a rare opportunity to exercise real power, in which both Heitkamp and Donnelly had real leverage. And they couldn\u2019t think any bigger than a few corporate handouts.\n\nIn 2016, EMILY\u2019s List, a PAC that funds Democratic women who back abortion rights, released a video highlighting Democratic women in the Senate, giving each lawmaker some camera time to highlight a signature issue. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) talked about women\u2019s access to health care. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) highlighted gun violence. Then-Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) talked about climate change, Stabenow called for action on clean drinking water, then-Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) spoke out for a new equal pay law, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) emphasized the opioid crisis, Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) talked about emergency relief funds and infrastructure, and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) said she\u2019d \u201chold Wall Street accountable.\u201d\n\nMcCaskill, by contrast, had no cause to champion. \u201cWhen we\u2019re on a mission, we get things done,\u201d she said to the camera. \u201cWe\u2019re here to do what needs doing. Period.\u201d\n\nA few days before the election, McCaskill arranged an interview with Fox News in which, among other things, she offered fulsome praise for Trump\u2019s unhinged anti-immigration efforts. She had been running radio ads in Missouri distancing herself from \u201cthose crazy Democrats,\u201d and when Fox News asked for some specifics, McCaskill cited her support for \u201ctooling back some of the regulations for small banks and credit unions.\u201d\n\nIf there were millions of small bankers in Missouri, this might be a good item to stake a campaign on. But when the sellout itself is the selling point, Democrats are in trouble.\n\nUPDATE: Nov. 14 \u2015 After publication, HuffPost received a note from the office of Mark Warner, who is mentioned in passing in the article above. Warner spokeswoman Rachel Cohen informed HuffPost she strongly disapproves of HuffPost reporter Zach Carter\u2019s coverage, and highlighted elements of the story Warner\u2019s office found troubling. The email is reproduced below. For HuffPost\u2019s prior coverage of Warner\u2019s work on the Senate Banking Committee, see this and this. Asked to comment on sending the note, Cohen told HuffPost, \u201cThe email speaks for itself.\u201d", "WASHINGTON \u2015 Two days after skipping a visit to an American military cemetery near Paris because it was raining, President Donald Trump called for effectively disenfranchising overseas military members voting in Florida, raising further questions about the draft-evading president\u2019s commitment to the armed services.\n\n\u201cThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,\u201d Trump tweeted early on Monday, the observed Veterans Day holiday for the federal government. \u201cAn honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\u201d\n\nScott and DeSantis are the GOP\u2019s candidates for U.S. senator and governor in Florida whose election-night margins of victory have resulted in legally mandated recounts.\n\nBut skipping those recounts would not only violate state law, it would ignore the ballots of tens of thousands of Florida-based troops deployed overseas. Those ballots are supposed to be counted if they arrive by this coming Friday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice commentary from the commander-in-chief on Veterans Day,\u201d said Will Fischer, who served in Iraq as a Marine and is now with the VoteVets group.\n\nLess than two-and-a-half hours after Trump\u2019s 7:44 a.m. tweet, the White House announced that Trump would remain there with no public events for the rest of the day.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to Arlington. He\u2019s not even going up to Walter Reed,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cOnce again, Donald Trump only sees the military as props. If it doesn\u2019t benefit him, he\u2019s not going to do it.\u201d\n\nArlington National Cemetery is minutes from the White House across the Potomac River in Virginia. Walter Reed is the Army hospital a short helicopter ride away in Bethesda, Maryland, where service members wounded in combat are treated.\n\nThe White House did not respond to repeated queries about the president\u2019s lack of a schedule on Monday. Nor did it respond to questions about Trump\u2019s decision to cancel a visit to the American cemetery in France on Saturday and instead remain indoors tweeting, rather than go to an alternate site closer by.\n\nMilitary officials in charge of transporting Trump prefer not to fly the Marine One helicopter through rain or fog, and the Secret Service prefers not to use motorcades for long drives when abroad.\n\nIn a statement to reporters during Trump\u2019s flight back to Washington on Sunday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that a motorcade to the Aisne-Marne cemetery some 55 miles northeast of Paris would have lasted two-and-a-half hours each way and required many hours of road closures that would have been a major inconvenience for local residents.\n\nThe two-and-a-half-hour estimate, though, is considerably longer than the estimates from both Google Maps and Mappy, a site popular in France, which came up with one hour and 22 minutes on Monday afternoon. And presidential motorcades generally drive significantly faster than ordinary motorists are allowed to.\n\nWhite House advance teams usually plan for contingencies, particularly weather, by coming up with alternative travel arrangements and alternative destinations.\n\n\u201cAdvance teams, working in close coordination with the Secret Service, typically start building contingency plans weeks \u2013 if not months \u2013 in advance,\u201d said Ned Price, a spokesman for then-President Barack Obama\u2019s National Security Council who sat through many hours of advance team debriefs in the last administration.\n\n\u201cThey do so with precisely this type of scenario in mind, and rain in this part of France would\u2019ve been high on the list of envisioned contingencies,\u201d Price said. \u201cIt would seem to strain credulity to believe that President Trump was unable to attend the ceremony. It seems much more likely that he chose not to.\u201d\n\nThere are other American cemeteries and monuments closer to Paris, and Trump could have visited one of them instead, even on short notice. Quick unannounced visits are often deemed relatively safe by the Secret Service because potential adversaries have no time to plan for them, either.\n\nInstead, as other European leaders braved the rain Saturday to attend commemorative services at various sites around Paris, Trump remained at the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence the entire afternoon and into the evening, when he arrived more than an hour late to a state dinner hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nFischer, of VoteVets, is skeptical that the president even made good use of those hours. \u201cI think he sat there in a bathrobe watching Fox News and tweeting ridiculousness,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring the afternoon, Trump had, in fact, issued tweets, including: \u201cTrying to STEAL two big elections in Florida! We are watching closely!\u201d\n\nOn the campaign trail in 2015, Trump claimed that he would be the \u201cmost militaristic\u201d president the country had ever seen. (He likely meant he would be the most supportive of the military, rather than the one most prone to start wars, which is what that phrasing might more readily imply.)\n\nHis words and actions, though, have not necessarily reflected support for the military and its members. Before he became president, Trump insulted the late Sen. John McCain, a former POW, saying that he himself preferred those who had not been captured. He also insulted a Gold Star Muslim family whose son had been killed in 2004 in Iraq while saving those under his U.S. Army command.\n\nSince he became president, Trump has made but a single visit to Dover Air Force Base to meet the returning coffins of fallen soldiers and has never visited troops in a combat zone. Even the two major accomplishments he boasts of \u2015providing record-high budgets for the military and passing a law to let veterans see local private doctors \u2015 are both false.\n\nObama approved a $721 billion defense budget in 2010 and a $717 billion budget in 2011. Both were higher than the $716 billion budget this year that Trump repeatedly brags about \u2013 even before adjusting for inflation. And the \u201cveterans choice\u201d program that Trump claims passed because of him was actually also passed under Obama, in 2014.\n\nAnd now, Trump has deployed thousands of troops to the Mexican border to string up barbed wire against what he describes as an \u201cinvasion\u201d of Central American refugees seeking asylum, even though they are still hundreds of miles away. The soldiers are likely to remain there through the Thanksgiving holiday, at least.\n\n\u201cRipping people from their families and their training and deploying them to the border for the purpose of, well, your guess is as good as mine,\u201d Fischer said.\n\nTrump himself avoided military service when he had the opportunity during the Vietnam War, receiving four education deferments and then claiming a medical exemption because of bone spurs in his heels.\n\nHe later compared the dangers of war to the risks of contracting sexually transmitted diseases from the women he was sleeping with. \u201cIt is my personal Vietnam,\u201d he told radio host Howard Stern in 1997. \u201cI feel like a great and very brave soldier.\u201d\n\nDespite his personal avoidance of military service, though, Trump has long described himself as a great supporter of the armed forces and has particularly enjoyed the pageantry associated with it.\n\nAfter attending France\u2019s Bastille Day parade in 2017, Trump told the U.S. Defense Department that he wanted a full military parade of his own, including tanks, for Veterans Day 2018. But after cost estimates of $92 million for the event \u2015 which included estimates for repairing roads damaged by the tanks \u2013 were leaked in August, Trump canceled the parade and announced he would go to Paris, instead.\n\n\u201cThe local politicians who run Washington, D.C. (poorly) know a windfall when they see it. When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade, they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it. Never let someone hold you up! I will instead attend the big parade already scheduled at Andrews Air Force Base on a different date, & go to the Paris parade, celebrating the end of the War, on November 11th. Maybe we will do something next year in D.C. when the cost comes WAY DOWN. Now we can buy some more jet fighters!\u201d he wrote in a pair of Aug. 17 tweets.\n\nBut there was no parade of any consequence in Paris this past weekend. European leaders have been de-emphasizing military might and nationalism \u2013 among the causes of both World Wars \u2013 and emphasizing international cooperation, which Trump has openly disdained since taking office."]
