["Famed horror writer Stephen King issued a last-minute plea to his Iowa-based fans to vote a fellow Steve King, a Republican representative in the state, out of public office during Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n\u201cIowans, for personal reasons I hope you\u2019ll vote Steve King out,\u201d the writer King wrote to his five million Twitter followers. \u201cI\u2019m tired of being confused with this racist dumbbell.\u201d\n\nIowans, for personal reasons I hope you\u2019ll vote Steve King out. I\u2019m tired of being confused with this racist dumbbell. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) November 4, 2018\n\nThe political King, an eight-term congressman, routinely spouts white nationalist views and recently endorsed a far-right white nationalist in Toronto\u2019s mayoral race. He also frequently retweets other white supremacists on Twitter and has warned about \u201cmixing cultures.\u201d\n\nThe author King has regularly wielded his social media account to criticize politicians, most notably President Donald Trump. Last month, he challenged Trump\u2019s political assertions about asylum seekers, firing back that the so-called caravan of migrants fleeing violence in Central America were simply \u201cscared and hungry people,\u201d not an existential threat to American values.\n\nHe simply followed up with a note of disappointment, telling the president: \u201cJesus, man.\u201d\n\nKing, the congressman, has been forced to go on the defensive several times in recent days, erupting at a questioner during a forum in his home state last week who asked the lawmaker about his political views. An unidentified man appeared to link King\u2019s rhetoric with the suspect in the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue last month, an assertion that caused the politician to go ballistic.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d King told the man, before telling security to escort him from the room. \u201cDo not associate me with that shooter.\u201d\n\nDespite his denial, the lawmaker has recently lost a number of high profile donors over his political stances. Land O\u2019Lakes, the Minnesota dairy-giant, said last week it would no longer donate to his campaign because the company wanted its contributions to be used as \u201ca positive force for good.\u201d Two other major donors have also withdrawn support in recent days.", "A 15-year-old aspiring homicide detective has been charged with first-degree premeditated murder after authorities said he strangled his mother and then recruited friends to help bury her body following an argument about his grades.\n\nThe Florida teen, who attended a police explorer program in Orange City, was taken into custody after local authorities on Saturday said he gave a disturbingly callous reenactment of the crime that was initially staged to look like a home burglary.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t begin to imagine how wild this story was,\u201d Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood said at a press conference.\n\nVolusia County Sheriff's Department Gail Cleavenger, 46, was strangled to death by her 15-year-old son following an argument about a grade he received at school, authorities said.\n\nAuthorities said what started as an argument over a D letter grade at school ended with 46-year-old Gail Cleavenger being strangled to death in her bed as her husband was out of the state for business on Thursday night.\n\nIn an effort to cover up the crime, her son allegedly recruited two juvenile friends to help him bury her body in a church\u2019s fire pit and then stage a burglary at their home. The boy then went to school Friday morning and came home to report his mother as missing to police and their home ransacked by unknown intruders.\n\nSgt. A.J. Pagliari, with the Sheriff\u2019s Major Case Unit, said at a press conference that the teen confessed to the crime after his two friends came clean, which led to them being charged with accessory to first-degree murder.\n\nHe described the boy as appearing \u201cvery proud of what he did\u201d during his re-telling of the events.\n\nThe boy, who is not being identified by HuffPost as it\u2019s not clear whether he will be charged as an adult, had taken criminal justice classes at a university and had been fascinated with the investigation to the point that he invited the sergeant to go \u201cadmire his work\u201d at the crime scene, Pagliari said.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I did a really good job at staging everything,\u2019\u201d Pagliari said.\n\nThough the boy said he wanted to be a homicide detective one day, Pagliari said: \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m standing here, and he\u2019s where he belongs.\u201d", "View this post on Instagram\n\nMuch love & appreciation @badgalriri! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe #Repost @badgalriri with @get_repost \u30fb\u30fb\u30fb FLORIDA: You have the opportunity to make history this election.

Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., who faces a stiff challenge from Republican businessman Mike Braun. Later in the day, the former president was campaigning in his hometown of Chicago for businessman J.B. Pritzker, Democrats\u2019 nominee for Illinois governor.\n\nObama has taken on a more public role this fall after refraining from offering a full-blown counterpoint to Trump\u2019s policies, which have sought to dismantle Obama\u2019s legacy. Without invoking his name, Obama has accused Trump of lying and \u201cfear-mongering\u201d and warned Democrats not to be distracted.\n\nTrump has punched back, accusing Obama of leaving behind a trail of broken promises on trade, the economic recovery and a promise during his presidency that patients could keep their doctors under his health care law.\n\nTrump was holding Sunday afternoon rallies in Macon, Georgia, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, in support of Republican Brian Kemp, who is running for Georgia governor, and Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who is seeking an open Senate seat in Tennessee.\n\nA look at campaign activities on Sunday:\n\n___\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nThe White House pushed back against claims that Trump\u2019s recent steps to secure the U.S. southern border were motivated by the upcoming election.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that the president\u2019s moves had nothing to do with electoral politics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been involved in scores of conversations about stopping illegal immigration from Mexico and never once has there been a discussion of the political impact in U.S. domestic politics,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cIt has always been about securing the safety of the American people and securing our southern border.\u201d\n\nTrump is sending up to 15,000 U.S. troops to the border to stave off a caravan of migrants slowly making its way through southern Mexico, hundreds of miles from the border. Trump has also announced plans to try to end the constitutionally protected right of birthright citizenship for all children born in the U.S.\n\n___\n\nSENATE STAKES\n\nRepublicans predicted that they would pad their two-seat Senate majority even though the party of a first-term president typically struggles in midterm elections. Democrats are defending 10 Senate seats in states Trump carried in 2016.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said Republicans would not only \u201chold the majority \u2014 I believe we\u2019re going to add to it.\u201d Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel pointed to the recent October jobs report as evidence Republicans are delivering.\n\n\u201cWe have a record of results and the Democrats have a record of resistance and obstruction,\u201d she said, arguing that voters would return Republicans to the majority.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said that even if voters are motivated by a strong economy, \u201cmany people realize we need a check on this president.\u201d And Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said the party still has a \u201cvery narrow path\u201d to a Senate majority despite facing the toughest Senate political map in 60 years.\n\nMcDaniel and Warner appeared on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Tillis appeared on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d and Van Hollen appeared on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d and ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n___\n\nELECTION SECURITY\n\nWarner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said that people should \u201cgo out and vote with confidence\u201d but that the White House has \u201cfrankly held back\u201d on ensuring the election will be secure.\n\nThe Virginia Democrat faulted the White House for opposing an election security bill that would have ensured that every polling station had a paper ballot to audit after the election. And he questioned Trump\u2019s decision to eliminate the role of cybersecurity coordinator on the National Security Council.\n\nTrump received a briefing on election security last week. U.S. intelligence agencies jointly asserted last month that Russia, China, Iran and other countries are engaged in continuous efforts to influence American policy and voters in the upcoming elections and beyond.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin and Zeke Miller contributed to this report.\n\n___", "A white woman who was filmed harassing two black sisters outside of an apartment complex in North Carolina last month has reportedly turned herself over to the police to face charges stemming from the incident.\n\nSusan Westwood, widely dubbed \u201cSouth Park Susan,\u201d was booked by the Sunset Beach Police Department on Saturday on an outstanding misdemeanor warrant for misuse of the 911 system and four criminal summons, local station WCNC reported.\n\nShe was transferred to the Brunswick County Sheriff\u2019s Department, NBC News reported, and later released. The sheriff\u2019s department did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nFacebook Susan Westwood, 51, turned herself into the Sunset Beach Police Department on Saturday after being wanted on charges related to the Oct. 19 incident.\n\nThe 51-year-old\u2019s arrest follows her harassment of sisters Leisa Garris and Chele Garris in a parking lot in Charlotte\u2019s South Park neighborhood as they waited for assistance from AAA on Oct. 19.\n\n\u201cIs your boyfriend here, is your baby daddy here? Nobody cares. I\u2019m white and I\u2019m hot,\u201d the woman is heard telling the two sisters. \u201cI\u2019m still gonna make $125,000. Who are you?\u201d\n\nWestwood was also heard claiming to have a concealed carry permit and threatening to \u201cbring out\u201d her weapon.\n\nOne woman in the background of the recording remarked that Westwood smelled of alcohol.\n\nWestwood was fired from her job following the incident.\n\nPolice were called to the scene but Westwood had left before they arrived. Officers said Westwood called 911 to falsely report attempted break-ins near her home before leaving the scene, according to Charlotte station WBTV.\n\n\u201cThere are folks that are trying to break in. They\u2019re trying to get in the apartments.\u201d Westwood told police, according to the station. \u201cThey are actually people that I\u2019ve never seen here before \u2015 but they are African American.\u201d\n\nAttorney Michael Phillips, who has been hired to represent the Garris sisters, told WBTV that he has been in contact with the apartment complex and its management has agreed to evict Westwood.\n\nWestwood has also been fired from her job at Charter Communications.", "We live in a society saturated with propaganda, conspiratorial thinking, scapegoating and delegitimization, all of it disproportionately deployed to suit the needs of the GOP and its overwhelmingly white constituency. In our political sphere, this constant stream of misinformation stems from a philosophy so invested in the desires and needs of white men that it demands the extraction of the lives and humanity of everyone else.\n\nThey do not pretend to have a list of meaningful policies that they will pass to the benefit of every citizen.\n\nAnd if a few seeds planted yield bloody fruit, what of it? This philosophy says that violence is as inevitable as it is tragic, and no action need be taken except offers of thoughts and prayers.\n\nThese are the effects of white supremacy.\n\nBut the reality of white supremacy is as undeniable as it is terrible. It is in the fear of practicing your faith and meeting as a community because the government will do nothing to protect you from violence. It is in allowing unchecked lies to whittle away at the concept of shared truth, allowing truth to be whatever an individual wants it to be. It is in knowing that your voice has been silenced by a map that you can never hope to overturn. It is in having your citizenship \u2015 and by extension, humanity \u2015 defined out of existence.\n\nWhite supremacy will not diminish over time or come to a natural halt. It will not give ground quietly or respect institutions. Those institutions are conveniently cast as foundational when they promote the interests of white supremacy and meaningless when they do not. Negotiation is futile because white supremacy does not negotiate in good faith. The violence is part of the attraction, and it views entire classes of people as unworthy of mourning. It will not bend to hear other voices, because the entire point of the philosophy is that only one group of people has voices worth hearing.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS It has to be made clear that our polity is prepared \u2015 white dominated though it is \u2015 to begin exiling white supremacy from American political life.\n\nThis is what the GOP has offered the country as we approach one of the most consequential midterm elections in American history. Republicans do not pretend to have a list of meaningful policies that they will pass to the benefit of every citizen. They do not campaign on their supposed accomplishments during the past two years. They do not tender olive branches or seek compromise with citizens who disagree with their vision. Instead, the GOP promises an escalation of white supremacy and support for Trump\u2019s every depravity, no matter how unlawful.\n\nAt the moment, many Republicans are endorsing or defending the president\u2019s decision to send troops to the southern border to prevent unarmed refugees from claiming their human right to asylum. Others in the GOP are still hoping to undermine the Mueller investigation and the Department of Justice. More Republicans still are spreading conspiratorial lies about their local opponents and about national Democrats, even after several prominent Democrats were targets of a terrorist assassination attempt.\n\nThe Republican Party has abandoned a closing argument for a primal scream. But it does not have to work.\n\nThough white supremacy cannot be diminished, reasoned with or loved into submission, it can be pushed out. It can be rebuked and repudiated. It can be tethered to an extraordinary electoral loss, a removal from power that would shame the ideology\u2019s ancestors. If Republicans have chosen to epitomize white supremacy then we can choose to reject them at the polls.\n\nIn this white voters are uniquely situated. Diverse voters have already chosen our alignment, but white voters are typically split. It will be the task of enough white voters to mobilize against this poisonous atmosphere and attack on democracy. It has to be made clear that our polity is prepared \u2015 white dominated though it is \u2015 to begin exiling white supremacy from American political life and to demonstrate that no one willing to espouse, promote or ally with these politics should wield the power of government.\n\nThe violence and fear ahead of these elections is a tragedy and a portent. With continued Republican rule, we could have a society in which these sacrifices of lives and communities are common and apologies are rare; in which the costs of violence are downplayed and the effects on many uninterrogated; in which truth is defined by what you choose to believe.", "Ten years ago Sunday, Americans elected a young senator from Illinois named Barack Obama to be the 44th president of the United States.\n\nThe country\u2019s first black president recalled the historic night of Nov. 4, 2008, in an Instagram post on the anniversary.\n\n\u201cWhen more people get off the sidelines and decide to participate, our country becomes a little more representative of its people \u2015 of everyone\u2019s collective decision,\u201d Obama wrote. \u201cAnd American politics can change as a result.\n\nHe continued: So on Election Day this Tuesday, I\u2019m not just asking you to vote.

Ellie desperately tries to wrangle a gun lying nearby on the floor, but it\u2019s just out of her reach. Acting fast, child hacker Lex (Ariana Richards) tries to activate the door locks on the Unix system. Her brother Tim ... just stands there.\n\nWell, at one point Tim does jump up and down. But, for the most part, he just stands behind his sister while Alan and Ellie struggle. Over the years, the odd moment has inspired some frustrated parodies. But none answered the question: Why, Tim? Why?\n\n\u201cMistakes were made, OK? Mistakes were made\u201d Joe Mazzello, the actor who played Tim, recently told me.\n\n\u201cIt was a high-pressure situation,\u201d he noted. \u201cMaybe Dr. Grant didn\u2019t want an 8-year-old boy handling a gun. That\u2019s one theory, but all I have to say is... I wasn\u2019t a complete bozo in the movie. Tim at least understood, \u2019Hey, don\u2019t shine the light in the T-Rex\u2019s face.\u2032 So I\u2019ll give myself credit for that one.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe the gun thing was a mistake,\u201d he added, \u201cbut all\u2019s well that ends well.\u201d\n\nAnd it has ended up pretty well for Mazzello. Since his \u201cJurassic Park\u201d days, the actor has appeared in high-profile projects like \u201cThe Social Network\u201d and \u201cThe Pacific.\u201d In his latest role, he\u2019s a dead ringer for Queen bassist John Deacon in the Freddie Mercury/Queen biopic \u201cBohemian Rhapsody.\u201d\n\nIn our interview, the actor explained how he got the part in the recently released, Rami Malek-led movie and why his spot-on John Deacon look even had him confused. And he continued to humor my \u201cJurassic Park\u201d questions, including another age-old conundrum: Why didn\u2019t Tim just climb through the electric fence?\n\nSo you look exactly like Queen bassist John Deacon. How did you end up playing him?\n\nIt was a pretty unusual process. I was in London when it was announced that Rami Malek was going to play Freddie, and I\u2019ve known Rami for years, so I thought that was really cool. I was with my manager and he was like, \u201cHey, I actually know one of the producers. Let\u2019s go and see them because they\u2019re in London.\u201d He sort of did a soft pitch of me at a bar and was like, \u201cHey, you should put Joe in your movie.\u201d They were like, \u201cOh, do you play guitar?\u201d And I was like, \u201cNot as good as Queen,\u201d and they were like, \u201cOK, hmm.\u201d I was like, well this is never happening, so I basically forgot about it. I appreciate my overzealous manager, but it\u2019s not happening.\n\nThen it was probably about three weeks. I got a text from my manager again saying, \u201cHey, guess what? They\u2019re interested in you for \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody.\u2019 You look a lot like John Deacon the bassist.\u201d I did a little Google search of John Deacon and then immediately called my mother and said, \u201cMom, where were you in 1983? You have some explaining to do.\u201d This guy could def be my dad.\n\nWow, that\u2019s crazy. So can we confirm John Deacon is not your dad?\n\nI haven\u2019t taken a DNA test but yeah, no. It is weird though, isn\u2019t it? At one point, if I just squint my eyes a little bit, kind of bring my lip out, I sort of know how to hold my face to look like him and move like him, and before you know it it\u2019s really uncanny.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s like exact.\n\n[Queen drummer Roger Taylor] saw a photo of me in the makeup trailer one day, and he was like, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve never seen that photo of John.\u201d And it\u2019s like, \u201cNo, that\u2019s actually Joe.\u201d\n\nWhat was it like during the Mike Myers cameo? In the movie he\u2019s playing a producer who\u2019s discouraging \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d saying no one will ever want to play it in a car, which is clearly giving a nod to how he rocks out to it in \u201cWayne\u2019s World.\u201d\n\nI am a lifelong fan of Mike Myers. I think I fit the Mike Myers fan profile pretty good, and so it was a very cool thing... just to watch him work. He came on set in character, in costume. I didn\u2019t know it was him at first, which was very funny. And then I went, \u201cOh crap. That\u2019s actually Mike Myers.\u201d\n\nNo way. How long did it take to recognize him?\n\nIt only took like maybe 30 seconds, but still, it was long enough to be like, \u201cOh wait a minute. Oh my God. Mike Myers is in the room.\u201d What was really cool about it is even though he was only on set for three days, he could\u2019ve been like... he comes in, does a cameo, he tells some jokes, he gets out of there. But he cared so deeply about making it great and getting the speeches right, and if he flubbed the lines, he\u2019d go, \u201cNo, let\u2019s do it again.\u201d He just wanted it to be so perfect. It was just cool to see that even in a small featured cameo role, he took his job so seriously and cared so deeply about the work.\n\nHe\u2019s passionate about Queen. A lot of people are, which may have been part of the reason there was so much controversy when the trailers came out and there were claims that the film was straightwashing Mercury\u2019s sexuality. As an actor, how did you feel about that? And how did you feel about how the movie handled it?\n\nIt was funny when that first trailer came out, because I just feel like nothing could be further from the truth about the movie that we made... I think a lot of people who felt that way felt different once they saw the film. I certainly do.\n\nI don\u2019t think there was any sort of straightwashing at all. I think it\u2019s a very truthful telling of Freddie Mercury\u2019s life. It would be untruthful if we didn\u2019t talk about the Mary Austin part of his life. He was engaged to a woman. She is the only person who knows where his ashes are, so this is someone who is deeply, deeply important to his life. She still runs his estate and lives in his home, so that all had to be dealt with. We had to tell that portion of his life, and then you see him go down a really bad path. You see some bad gay relationships and some very good gay relationships. Literally, our story ends with him introducing his boyfriend to his family and them being accepting of him.\n\n[Freddie\u2019s boyfriend Jim Hutton] says in the movie, \u201cCome back when you realize you love yourself,\u201d and that had to be Freddie\u2019s journey. He had to accept who he was and come to terms with it and embrace it. So you really see the entire journey of Freddie Mercury and his personal life. I actually felt like we handled it really well, and just because you don\u2019t get explicit or graphic about certain things, that\u2019s not the same thing as not dealing with it head-on.\n\nMichael Jackson is a part of your character\u2019s story, since Jackson apparently convinced Queen to release the John Deacon song \u201cAnother One Bites The Dust\u201d as a single. There\u2019s also obviously a lot of David Bowie in Queen\u2019s story. Were there ever scripts where they were included as characters? What were other Queen moments that maybe didn\u2019t make the final movie?\n\nThere was an early draft with Sid Vicious in it. Apparently he and Freddie got into a little bit of a fight, but that was a draft before I was even attached. There was never a version of it, though, with David Bowie or Michael Jackson that I\u2019m aware of. The script\u2019s been kicked around for 10 years. It\u2019s possible, but not that we filmed.\n\nYou\u2019ve also been in \u201cThe Social Network.\u201d Have you ever met your real-life counterpart in that movie, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz.\n\nI never met Dustin. I think initially the Facebook guys were not too keen on the movie coming out. I think they came around to it pretty quickly though, because it was a pretty fun movie and successful. I don\u2019t think it was necessarily damning toward anyone. I think it\u2019s a fairly fair depiction of who these guys are. But it would be really great, if he owns 6 percent of the company, if he wanted to finance a movie I was in or a movie I want to direct. That would be really great.\n\nHow do you feel about Facebook and social media now?\n\nI remember being on Facebook... and I had no clue what it was going to become. My girlfriend at the time wanted me to sign on, so my profile was just like, teasing her. Basically making fun of her. Before I knew it I suddenly started getting thousands of friend requests, and I was like, \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d And it turned out some blog was like, \u201cHey, the kid from \u2018Jurassic Park\u2019 is on Facebook, and here\u2019s a link to his profile.\u201d I suddenly realized, \u201cWhoa, you put something on the internet, and it\u2019s forever.\u201d And these pictures and my life are something that I have to recognize has to be guarded a little bit tighter.\n\nSpeaking of \u201cJurassic Park,\u201d one other question I have is: Why didn\u2019t Tim just climb through the electric fence?\n\nMan, do you know what\u2019s funny? I love heights. I\u2019m like the exact opposite, so when we did that scene and we\u2019re supposed to be climbing, I climbed up faster than anyone and got to the top and suddenly everyone had a freakout. Steven Spielberg ran out from video village and was like, \u201cNo, no, no, no, no! Joey, Joey, come down slowly. Slowly drop down. Everyone was terrified that I was going to get hurt, and I was up there like it was a jungle gym, having the time of my life.\n\nYeah, I think that maybe when they made the fence they didn\u2019t realize how small I was. That probably, yeah, I could\u2019ve fit through, but I think in the closeups you actually see a different fence. You actually see that it was a little bit smaller. In this day and age, with blu-ray and high definition, yeah, you maybe see some flaws. But let\u2019s suspend disbelief and not try to get too far in the weeds.\n\nHave you seen the new \u201cJurassic World\u201d movies?\n\nI actually haven\u2019t seen the most recent one. I have to be honest. But I am loving that they are so successful and that a younger generation is really getting into \u201cJurassic Park,\u201d because I think it\u2019s such a great franchise. And so I have nothing but love for those movies. Yeah, you never know. [It\u2019d be] a fun thing maybe if Tim Murphy reappeared, but that is not up to me.

People who claim to be Christian, wholeheartedly practicing their politics \u201cin the name of God,\u201d have wholly abandoned the way of Jesus who tells us from the beginning to care first for the poor, marginalized and downtrodden. The question posed by this week\u2019s midterm elections is yet again: Will Christians continue to compromise the way of Jesus in favor of perpetuating a Christian subculture obsessed with power \u2015 and the delusion that Trump\u2019s presidency is a direct result of God\u2019s will? Or will they break free of that trap?\n\nAs of 2017, 91 percent of Congress identified as Christian, and while this is a vague moniker in many ways, it is notably both unrepresentative of the total population (where three-fourths identify as Christian) and consistent with Christianity\u2019s overrepresentation in politics throughout the history of United States.\n\nChristians frequently call on the history of Christianity of the \u201cfounding fathers\u201d to back-up the authority of their politics in the U.S. without recognizing the inherently unchristian values that some of those founders held. From having affairs and using violence as a primary tool (most of them) to literally cutting and pasting the scriptures to create a religious ideology (Jefferson), the foundation of U.S. politics was laid on compromising the ways of Jesus in exchange for power. This same compromise was made to justify slavery, genocide of indigenous people and massive land theft and is the foundation of how Christians interact with the political system.\n\nThe equation is actually quite simple: Christians\u2019 (particularly Christian leaders) perception of moral authority, plus a contextual and universalized interpretation of the Bible, and the false notion that God ordained the U.S. to be a Christian nation, manifests in a spiritual rhetoric that backs up all power and violence as a means to an end for a Christian reality. This is a dangerous pattern present in American Christianity where those in power, believing that God is in control, create realities where their way is done and then call it God\u2019s plan. God\u2019s plan somehow always seems to agree with political agendas in this logical tail chasing.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be this way.\n\nAs Christians align ourselves with political parties, the key question becomes, \u201cWho and what would Jesus align himself with?\u201d Even a quick look at just the first few chapters of each of the gospels reveals a God that is less interested in moral purity or political power (which in the story Satan offers), and more interested in both embodying the experience of the marginalized and calling the poor, meek, hungry, merciful, pure in heart, persecuted and peacemakers to follow him in an upside down way of being. In Jesus\u2019 way, God\u2019s closeness has nothing to do with power and everything to do with alleviating suffering and siding with the concerns of the downtrodden.\n\nChristians in the U.S. would rather talk about a fallacious war on Christianity in order to recast themselves as the persecuted. The spiritual gymnastics required to fit ourselves into the role of the people who Jesus sided with his asinine.\n\nIf the lens of politics comes first, it is not hard to justify a whole range of positions with scripture.\n\nThere is not a lot in scripture that is clear \u2015 and it only ends up clear if we make a ton of assumptions. One thing that is clear, however, is that Jesus, when summing up the law, says that it\u2019s about loving God and loving people \u2015 not institutionalizing God and subjugating people.\n\nIt turns out, what Christians often perceive as a commitment to scripture is more specifically a commitment to Christian power. If the lens of politics comes first, it is not hard to justify a whole range of positions with scripture. It is how people like Attorney General Jeff Sessions can use scripture out of context one day to justify separating migrant children from their parents, but then ignore and kick out pastors who quote scripture back to him.\n\nThe psychology of victimhood allows them to claim that any critique of their Christianity is part of the effort to \u201cerode our great tradition of religious freedom.\u201d Theirs is a Christianity that, putting itself at the center, cannot see how its policies impact those who don\u2019t share its interests.\n\nChristian political rhetoric, and by extension voting, largely centers on \u201ctaking a stand\u201d against things that seem unchristian, but seem inherently disinterested in living out the way of Jesus. In the modern Republican party, this is most clear around abortion, where it is notable that anti-choice policy, while seen as \u201ctaking a stand,\u201d doesn\u2019t actually decrease abortions. The issue functions purely as a source of performative moral outrage that eliminates Christians\u2019 capacity for nuanced, educated, responsible and holistic voting.\n\nMorality and ethics are not absolute and scripture doesn\u2019t treat them like they are \u2015 the Bible is full of God not telling people what to do specifically, them doing super messed up stuff and scripture seemingly remaining indifferent. What is notable are the things that do seem to be constants \u2015 love for God and sacrificial love for others regardless of identity.\n\nAt the end of the day, if we opt into politics that deeply humanize people regardless of identity, we enter into the story of the people Jesus aligned himself with.\n\nHistory doesn\u2019t typically look back fondly on those who attempt to \u201cconserve\u201d traditional ways, and scripture doesn\u2019t expect that culture will always look the same. The cultural values of Jesus\u2019 time do not line up with ours, so the values must be understood contextually, not just at face value. In the choice in partisan politics between flawed candidates on all sides, Christians\u2019 engagement with politics ought not just mean unquestioningly supporting candidates like Trump who promise them seats at the table of power, but to call all politicians to higher standards of the common good.\n\nWe must be educated voters and political actors, choosing not based on single issues or partisan politics, but by looking at candidates and their overall impacts more consciously. It is our responsibility to emulate Christ and not the people who have distorted him to their own purpose.\n\nJesus didn\u2019t use his name to gain political power. We ought to be careful with our own temptation to do so.", "The controversial ad attacks Democrats for allowing Bracamontes to enter the country, though he was first deported during President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration.

In March, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, announced he had decided to add the question. Civil rights groups and other critics say the question is unnecessary and designed to scare immigrants and other minorities into not responding to the decennial survey. An inaccurate count would have severe and lasting consequences because census data are used to draw electoral districts and determine how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds are allocated.\n\nThe census currently asks about citizenship in the American Community Survey, a longer questionnaire that goes out to more than 3.5 million households each year. It has not asked about citizenship on its decennial survey \u2015 which goes out to every American household \u2015 since 1950. The Voting Rights Act, the basis for the Justice Department\u2019s request to add the citizenship question, was passed in 1965.\n\nThe case, State of New York, et al. v. United States Department of Commerce, et al., is likely to focus on the way Commerce Department officials made the decision to add the citizenship question. The plaintiffs in the case \u2015 18 states, the District of Columbia, several cities and a handful of immigrant groups \u2015 say the decision to add the question was motivated by discriminatory intent. They say the Justice Department\u2019s request was a pretext and Ross was set on adding the question before DOJ asked the Census Bureau to do it and ignored evidence and recommendations that he should not add the question. The Commerce Department also made the decision to add the question without testing it \u2015 an unusual practice given that questions are typically added to the census only after they\u2019ve been extensively tested.\n\nAgence France-Presse The Trump administration is defending a decision by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census\n\nThe Trump administration says the question is not discriminatory and that Ross acted within his authority when he decided to add it.\n\nWhile opening arguments are on Monday, the plaintiffs and the Trump administration have been fighting for months about how much information the government has to share about the decision. It\u2019s easy to see why: The information the government has disclosed so far has substantially undermined its public justification for adding the question.\n\nThe emails show Ross eager to get the question on the census far in advance of the Justice Department\u2019s request and getting frustrated that it was taking so long. He also disclosed in June that he had discussed adding the question with \u201csenior administration officials\u201d \u2015 including Steve Bannon, \u2015 and that it was he who approached the Justice Department about adding the question, not the other way around.\n\nWhen he announced the decision, Ross downplayed concerns that the question would lead to a lower response rate. But a January memo from the Census Bureau\u2019s top scientist warned that adding the question would be \u201cvery costly, harms the quality of the census count, and would use substantially less accurate citizenship status data than are available from administrative sources.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions reportedly personally blocked the Justice Department from meeting with Census Bureau officials to discuss alternatives to adding the question.\n\nJohn Gore, a top official in the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division closely involved in the request, said in a deposition he didn\u2019t know if the data collected through a citizenship question would be any better than the citizenship data DOJ already has.\n\nThe case is likely to eventually be decided by the Supreme Court, which has already weighed in twice in the case. It agreed to block Ross from having to sit for a deposition and answer questions under oath about adding the question. The Supreme Court on Friday also declined to halt the trial over a dispute on what evidence U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman, an appointee of Barack Obama, can consider in the case.", "If you couldn\u2019t handle the rollercoaster of emotions that \u201cToy Story 3\u201d evoked, you might want to reconsider buying a ticket for the next installment of the franchise.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Radio on Thursday, Tom Hanks, who voices Woody, described the final scenes of \u201cToy Story 4\u201d as \u201cimpactful\u201d and \u201ca moment in history.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way you record \u201cToy Story\u201d is you\u2019re in a room with a team that has created it,\u201d he said on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show.\n\n\u201cWhen I went in for my last day of recording, I wanted to have my back to them because usually you\u2019re facing them so you can look right up and you can talk about it but I didn\u2019t want to see them and I wanted to pretend they couldn\u2019t see me.\u201d\n\nWhile Hanks didn\u2019t go into the specifics, his co-star Tim Allen has previously said that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t even get through the last scene.\u201d\n\n\u201cI gotta resist getting emotional.

Matt Shea, R-Spokane, is facing intense criticism for distributing a document describing how a \"Holy Army\" should kill people who flout \"biblical law,\" with some campaign donors asking for their contributions back.\n\nSPOKANE, Wash. (AP) \u2014 A Republican lawmaker in Washington state denied Friday that he is racist or a white nationalist for distributing a document describing how a \u201cHoly Army\u201d should kill people who flout biblical law.\n\nState Rep. Matt Shea of Spokane Valley in conservative eastern Washington has been under fire since he acknowledged in a Facebook video last week that he had distributed the four-page document titled, \u201cBiblical Basis for War\u201d to some of his supporters.\n\nThe document condemns abortion and same-sex marriage and describes how those who don\u2019t follow biblical law should be punished. At one point, the document says, \u201cIf they do not yield, kill all males.\u201d\n\nNews of the document prompted several of Shea\u2019s political contributors to demand refunds of their donations.\n\n\u201cI have consistently and unequivocally condemned racism, anti-Semitism and white nationalism and do so again,\u201d Shea said in a Friday tweet.\n\nHe said his critics were involved in a \u201cridiculous smear\u201d to derail his election to a sixth term in the state House, where he has served since his election in 2008.\n\n\u201cI look forward to serving again ... and fighting for lower taxes, less government, and more freedom for all of you,\u201d Shea wrote, adding it would be his final statement on the matter.\n\nShea has embraced far-right conspiracy theories, mingled with militia groups, visited right-wing activists who seized a wildlife refuge in Oregon in 2016, and led a push to convert eastern Washington into a 51st state, called Liberty.\n\nHe represents a deeply conservative district that keeps electing him because he is effective in promoting his business-friendly agenda.\n\nShea, a lawyer, has said the document was merely a summary of sermon notes based on the Old Testament and that he was not promoting violence.\n\nHe did not return a message left by The Associated Press.\n\nCritics including his Democratic opponent, Ted Cummings, and Republican Spokane County Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich have called the document a guideline for Christian domination.\n\nOther critics said the document appears to call for violence against people who do not share Shea\u2019s religious views.\n\nCummings said the attention appeared to trigger a wave of small contributions to his long-shot campaign for the legislative seat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed by the support coming in!\u201d Cummings tweeted. \u201cWe brought this dangerous, destructive man out of the shadows, into the open.\u201d\n\nShea also is facing backlash from some of his donors.

(AP) \u2014 A western Wisconsin community on Sunday was grieving the deaths of three Girl Scouts and an adult who were collecting trash along a rural highway when police say a pickup truck veered off the road and hit them before speeding away.\n\nAuthorities have not released the names of the girls or the woman who were struck by the truck on Saturday in Lake Hallie, including the name of a fourth girl who survived but was in critical condition at a hospital in Rochester, Minnesota. The girls were members of Troop 3055 and were fourth-grade students at Halmstad Elementary School in adjoining Chippewa Falls, which is about 90 miles east of Minneapolis.\n\n\u201cOur hearts are broken for the girls and families of the Girl Scouts of the Northwestern Great Lakes,\u201d CEO Sylvia Acevedo of Girl Scouts of the USA said in a statement Sunday. \u201cThe Girl Scout Movement everywhere stands with our sister Girl Scouts in Wisconsin to grieve and comfort one another in the wake of this terrible tragedy.\u201d\n\nLake Hallie police Sgt. Daniel Sokup said the pickup, a black Ford F-150, crossed a lane and veered into a roadside ditch, striking the victims. Other members of the troop were pickup up trash from the opposite shoulder.\n\nThe 21-year-old driver, Colten Treu of Chippewa Falls, sped off but later surrendered and will be charged with four counts of homicide, Sokup said. It was unclear Sunday if Treu had an attorney who could speak for him. Police misspelled Treu\u2019s first name as \u201cColton\u201d in initial news releases.\n\nSokup said it was not immediately known if there were other factors that might have led the driver to leave the road. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that the crash happened before a hill and there were no blind spots, Sokup said it was \u201cnot an unsafe area.\u201d\n\nBut Cecily Spallees, a personal care attendant at a group home near the crash site, told the newspaper that drivers regularly speed on that stretch of road, which quickly changes from a 55-mph to a 35-mph zone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always telling one of my residents that he shouldn\u2019t walk this strip at night,\u201d Spallees said. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe.\u201d", "In his latest pyrrhic victory, Hungary\u2019s authoritarian leader Viktor Orb\u00e1n has forced Central European University, the marquee English-language institution of higher education in the heart of Europe, to abandon much of its operations in Budapest and depart for nearby Vienna. The departure comes after a years-long campaign to penalize, de-certify and ultimately drive out CEU, which was founded three decades ago to provide a global education for those shaking off the yoke of communism in Eastern Europe.\n\nCEU\u2019s billionaire founder, George Soros, believed that the region, with the university as its engine, could become a powerhouse for democracy and truly vibrant societies. In the subsequent years, CEU became a global hub, attracting about 1,400 students from more than 100 countries. When I worked there, from 2010 until 2012, it was a place of incredible promise. Students held human rights workshops, faculty led classes on extremism and nationalism, speakers from around the world came to the \u201990s-era auditorium to lecture on bioethics and Ottoman history. Roma students were given opportunities to access higher education they have long been denied.\n\nBut such diversity of thought and character were no match for the era of illiberal democracy in Hungary, and the university\u2019s departure is the latest and perhaps most profound sign that Hungary\u2019s democracy truly is failing.\n\nThe university\u2019s departure is the latest and perhaps most profound sign that Hungary\u2019s democracy truly is failing.\n\nIn 2010, well before Brexit and well before the election of President Donald Trump, Hungary began a near-decade-long slide toward single-party control and the silencing of dissent. That year, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party swept to power on the heels of a painful economic downturn. With a two-thirds majority in parliament, Orb\u00e1n was able to redraw the country\u2019s election districts, locking up Fidesz\u2019s power. By 2011, a new media law gave Orb\u00e1n allies the power to impose fines for \u201cimbalanced news coverage,\u201d a move Human Rights Watch called \u201cincompatible with Hungary\u2019s human rights obligations.\u201d In subsequent years, opposition media outlets would close their doors.\n\nHungary has been a member of the European Union since 2004, and there was outcry from EU leaders following a flurry of laws that sapped the independence of the country\u2019s central bank and its judiciary. By 2012, Orb\u00e1n and his allies had rewritten the country\u2019s entire post-1989 constitution, a move critics said would erode free speech and civil rights even further.\n\nOrb\u00e1n\u2019s animosity toward Soros\u2019 work has been clear for some time. For years, Orb\u00e1n decried the influence of foreign-funded nongovernmental organizations, and in 2017 his government passed a bill requiring organizations receiving $26,000 annually from overseas sources to declare themselves \u201cforeign-supported,\u201d or risk closure. It was widely seen as a rebuke to any group connected to Soros\u2019 decades-long campaign of supporting pro-democracy organizations and movements across the region and the globe. During the summer of 2017, I counted well over 40 government-funded billboards between Budapest\u2019s airport and the city center, all depicting a grinning Soros and the caption, \u201cDon\u2019t let George Soros have the last laugh.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nLast year, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party moved to amend the country\u2019s higher education law, specifically targeting foreign universities. While the Soros-founded CEU operates as a partly Hungarian institution, its programs are accredited in the United States. The newly amended law\u2019s complex provisions \u2015 for instance, requiring a bilateral international agreement, incompatible with the fact that U.S. universities are mostly regulated at the state level \u2015 appeared to solely target CEU.\n\nWhile cautioning publicly that the new regulations might force CEU to close its doors, the university\u2019s current president, former Canadian Liberal Party leader Michael Ignatieff, and his predecessor, American diplomat John Shattuck, led the good fight. CEU students, faculty, staff and supporters flooded the streets of the Hungarian capital, insisting on academic freedom and criticizing the government\u2019s campaign to single out and shutter the institution. Emblazoned on buttons and shop windows was the campaign\u2019s rallying cry, #aCEUvalvagyok. \u201cI stand with CEU.\u201d\n\nAnd despite the law\u2019s onerous terms, CEU made an earnest effort to comply with the law. The university started operations at its sister school Bard College, and inked an agreement with New York state education officials that they believed could serve as the kind of bilateral agreement that the new law required. But this fall, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government refused to hold up its end of the bargain, failing to sign the mandated bilateral agreement. It was the ultimate proof that Orb\u00e1n and his enablers had been acting in bad faith all along.\n\nIn 2010, well before Brexit and well before the election of President Trump, Hungary began a near-decade long slide toward single-party control and the silencing of dissent.\n\nThat was the last straw for CEU\u2019s board and leadership. They announced that starting next academic year, CEU will commence operations for its U.S.-accredited programs at the parallel campus in Vienna. Fortunately, thanks to the largesse of its founder and its immense network of supporters, the university and its students will likely thrive there.\n\nIt\u2019s Hungarians and Hungary who stand to lose the most from CEU\u2019s departure. As one of Hungary\u2019s highest-ranked educational institutions, in 2015 alone CEU drew 9 billion forints (over $30 million) in research funds into the country and calculated in-country expenditures of over $35 million. The university just completed a multimillion-euro renovation project in the heart of Budapest\u2019s historic downtown. While the university says it will continue some operations in Hungary, it\u2019s clear the local economy will take a massive hit when it decamps to Vienna.\n\nBut beyond the economic damage, CEU\u2019s departure marks an inflection point after years of democratic decay. Opposition press has all but evaporated. Once-independent institutions are now firmly within Orb\u00e1n\u2019s control. His Fidesz party has forged a deep structural advantage against nearly all opponents. Orb\u00e1n continues to leverage fear of foreigners and migrants to shore up his right-wing base.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a pattern that seems to be consuming Eastern and Central Europe: In 2017, the democracy-monitoring NGO Freedom House gave Hungary the lowest ranking of the nations it monitors in Central Europe, and lowered its overall democracy scores for 18 of the 29 countries in Eastern Europe and central Asia. And it\u2019s all a little too familiar for anyone watching from the United States, where attacks on the press, electoral suppression and xenophobia have led us into a very dark moment.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in Hungary is, in some ways, unique to a small country whose experience with democracy is less than a generation old. But it\u2019s a cautionary tale about how the steady chipping away of norms and principles can cause irreparable harm. The departure of CEU represents not just yet another strike against yet another independent institution, it\u2019s a blow to the free inquiry, debate and academic freedom that form the backbone of strong, democratic societies. Hungary shows us those principles are more essential \u2015 and perhaps more fragile \u2015 than we might think.\n\nStephen Fee is director of media and strategic engagement at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law and worked in the communications department at Central European University from 2010 to 2012.", "In the lead-up to this year\u2019s midterm elections, HuffPost Opinion asked writers to examine the many ways that voting \u2015 a fundamental and hard-won civil right \u2015 is imperiled in the United States. In far too many cases, Americans are blocked from exercising that right. This piece is the first in that series, Democracy Denied.\n\nThe Muslim ban. The separation of families at the southern border. The president\u2019s refusal to unequivocally condemn white supremacists. Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court. Attempts to write transgender people out of the law.\n\nThe Trump administration routinely takes action that defies our sense of morality; that shatters the boundaries of decency and civility. The fear and anguish evoked by the president\u2019s policies take a personal toll. But change is within our reach. And that\u2019s precisely why Republicans are trying desperately to undermine our right to vote.\n\nAt our nation\u2019s founding, voting was enshrined only for educated white men who owned property. It took more than a century for the franchise to meaningfully expand to people of color, women, people with disabilities, people who are low-income and Native Americans. Today, some elected leaders are still working to silence people who were historically denied access to the ballot box. The media is calling voter suppression the Republican party\u2019s \u201csecret weapon.\u201d But there is nothing secret about their playbook.\n\nChange is within our reach. And that\u2019s precisely why Republicans are trying desperately to undermine our right to vote.\n\nTo understand that playbook, we must return to June 25, 2013, when five justices on the Supreme Court invalidated key provisions of the Voting Rights Act that for decades protected voters in states with histories of pernicious voting discrimination. Within 24 hours of the Shelby County v. Holder ruling, Texas and Alabama announced plans to plow ahead with restrictive and previously blocked voter-ID laws. And just weeks later, North Carolina passed a monster voter-suppression law that a federal court found had deliberately sought to disenfranchise Black and Latino voters with \u201csurgical precision.\u201d\n\nNow, in the absence of federal enforcement of voting rights and a robust Voting Rights Act, Republicans\u2019 attempts to erode voting rights are written plainly into legislation. And purging of voter rolls, or \u201cvoter maintenance,\u201d as Georgia Secretary of State and gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp calls it, is publicly celebrated as a solution to voter fraud \u2014 which nonpartisan studies show is virtually nonexistent. No amount of spin can disguise these tactics from what they are: dog whistle policies designed to confuse voters and ultimately deny their vote. Such policies are enthusiastically endorsed by the president and other members of his party at the federal and state level.\n\nAs the former head of the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division, I am proud of the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to challenge restrictive voting laws across the country. Sadly, it is a different department today. Under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the mandate is simple: make it harder to vote. In the 2018 case Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute, Sessions reversed the federal government\u2019s position and sided with Ohio\u2019s extreme practice of removing people from voter rolls. Sessions also dropped the DOJ\u2019s objection to a strict voter-ID law in Texas, which a federal judge found to be discriminatory against communities of color. With Sessions at the helm, the Justice Department has abdicated its responsibility to safeguard civil and human rights for all.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nNow, civil rights groups have taken up the mantle to protect and expand the right to vote. In Georgia, where voter registrations for 53,000 people are on hold, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, along with the Campaign Legal Center, contacted every person whose registration is pending, to inform them of their rights. Using text messages, the groups let people know they are still eligible and can vote if they show up to the polls with proper identification.\n\nFurther, All Voting is Local is removing barriers between voters and the ballot, particularly in historically disenfranchised communities. In Florida, after a federal court struck down a ban on early voting at public universities, the organization worked with local election officials to help college students vote early on their campuses.\n\nThat was not an isolated win. In courtrooms and statehouses across the country, we are seeing voting rights prevail. The issue is even showing up on the ballot in several states this week.\n\nAmong them is Florida, where voters have the opportunity to restore the franchise for an estimated 1.4 million people with felony convictions. If passed, Michigan\u2019s Proposal 3 will enact a sweeping modernization of voting, including automatic voter registration and extended registration deadlines up until, and on, Election Day.\n\nWith Sessions at the helm, the Justice Department has abdicated its responsibility to safeguard civil and human rights for all.\n\nStill, structural change is no substitute for people showing up to the polls. Trump and his ilk are working hard to suppress the vote, which is why it\u2019s all the more important for every one of us to vote, and to get our friends and family to do the same. We cannot let up.\n\nJust look at this year\u2019s primary results. Because people across America voted their values, more women won primaries in House and Senate races than ever before. Vermont\u2019s Democratic Party because the first major party to nominate a transgender candidate for the governorship, and a record number of African-Americans won their gubernatorial primaries. Michigan and Minnesota are soon to elect the first Muslim women to serve in Congress.\n\nThose wins are not flukes in the system. Over the last two years, people have exercised their power by registering to vote, many for the first time. They stepped off the sidelines and chose to participate in democracy by marching, calling and writing their legislators, signing petitions, organizing and talking about politics at the dinner table \u2014 a simple but radical act for many of us. Now, the field of political candidates looks more like America than ever before. We are better for it.\n\nDiverse leadership will shine a light on critical issues that for too long have been swept under the rug, dismissed or treated with contempt: police accountability, health care, protections for Dreamers and LGBTQ communities, workplace safety and equity, reproductive justice and rights for people with disabilities. People\u2019s lives hang in the balance. If these issues are to be addressed, we must elect leaders who insist they are top of the agenda. Our votes can move the nation to a place where justice and fairness are no longer mere ideals, but the values driving the decisions of elected leaders every day.\n\nThese elections could be the most important of our lifetime. As you head to the polls, know this: We have the power. We are the difference. Despair is the enemy of justice. If you are fed up, speak up \u2014 and vote. Together, let\u2019s call forth a new vision for America.", "ASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump has been using fear to motivate his base.\n\nThe Republican Party has aired eight times as many ads focused on crime and public safety as it did during the last midterm election, according to a HuffPost analysis, a reflection of President Donald Trump\u2019s strategy of trying to fire up the GOP\u2019s base with fear.\n\nDuring the last midterm elections, in 2014, Republicans running for House and Senate seats aired ads about public safety more than 12,000 times, according to data from Kantar Media/CMAG. That number spiked to nearly 107,000 for the 2018 election, an increase of more than 800 percent. While just 2 percent of GOP ads in 2014 dealt with crime, about 12 percent of their 2018 ads have touched on the subject.\n\nDemocrats have responded by airing more than 50,000 ads on the issue, typically to defend themselves in response to GOP attacks, up from just over 7,000 in 2014. That represents an increase from 1 percent of all ads to 4 percent.\n\nThe spike shows how Trump\u2019s successful use of fear-mongering about crime and immigration during his 2016 presidential bid has resurrected crime as a political issue in the United States, despite the overall crime rate remaining low and largely unchanged over the course of the past decade. Trump has unapologetically continued the rhetoric during the run-up to the midterm elections, and his party has followed suit. The ads have run in both the swing districts the GOP is counting on to fend off Democratic control of the House, and in the red-tinted states where they seek to expand their Senate majority.\n\n\u201cA blue wave equals a crime wave,\u201d Trump said Friday during a rally in West Virginia for Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in polls. \u201cA red wave equals jobs and safety.\u201d\n\nNot all of the public safety ads are negative or focus on the threat of crime. Some are positive spots about a candidate\u2019s support for law enforcement.\n\nStill, the spike has alarmed criminal justice reform advocates. Members of both parties have begun to embrace elements of criminal justice reform, including reduced penalties for low-level drug offenders and the elimination of mandatory minimum sentences, as ways to save government money and increase personal liberty.\n\nMS-13 is the new Willie Horton. Inimai Chettiar, the Brennan Center\n\n\u201cTrump resurrected a trend of talking about crime in really alarmist ways that we haven\u2019t seen in more than a decade,\u201d said Inimai Chettiar, the director of the Justice Program at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center.\n\nUnlike the earlier wave of crime ads in the 1980s and 1990s that focused on the threat of black criminals coming from the inner cities, the new ads suggest danger is coming from the southern border, even in districts thousands of miles away from the Rio Grande. Criminal justice scholars have repeatedly found no link between legal or illegal immigration and crime levels.\n\n\u201cMS-13 is the new Willie Horton,\u201d Chettiar said, adding that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of data out there showing no link between immigration and crime.\u201d\n\nSome of the ads suggest Democrats are insufficiently tough on sex offenders, and others slam candidates with prosecutorial backgrounds over the standard practice of cutting deals to give criminals shorter sentences if they plead guilty. Others attack Democrats for giving criminals a defense at all. But the most common ads seem to suggest undocumented immigrants pose a unique threat to Americans, and they slam Democrats for wanting to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\n\nOne spot, titled \u201cMurder, Gangs, Terrorism,\u201d attacks Democrat Ron DiNicola, a Marine veteran and lawyer running against GOP Rep. Mike Kelly in a conservative-learning Pennsylvania district, for representing \u201ca Mexican drug lord who tortured and murdered a U.S. agent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taught crime never pays,\u201d a male narrator says in the 30-second ad. \u201cBut for Ron DiNicola, crime paid.\u201d\n\nA Susquehanna University poll released last week gave DiNicola \u2015 who is running on his military background and work to get benefits for laid-off General Electric workers in the area \u2015 a 51 percent to 47 percent lead over Kelly in the district, which is based around the city of Erie.\n\nIn Kentucky\u2019s 6th District, Republican groups and GOP Rep. Andy Barr have hammered Democrat Amy McGrath, a former fighter pilot and one of the early stars of the midterm cycle, over her opposition to a border wall. The ads have also accused her of wanting to abolish ICE \u2015 a position she does not hold.\n\n\u201cAmy McGrath, undefended borders. Unsafe communities,\u201d a female narrator says at the end of one of Barr\u2019s ads. McGrath and Barr are in a toss-up race in a Republican-leaning district centered around Lexington.\n\nDemocrats have often responded with spots portraying their GOP opponents as desperate, or with ones that emphasize their support for law enforcement. In North Dakota\u2019s Senate race, Democrat Heidi Heitkamp defended herself from attacks on immigration and crime by featuring a retired police chief and Trump voter in her ads. (Heitkamp is trailing GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer in her re-election bid.)\n\n\u201cHeidi voted to arrest, imprison and deport illegal immigrants who commit crimes,\u201d the former police chief says. \u201cHeidi was a tough, law-and-order attorney general.\u201d\n\nIn Arizona\u2019s contest, Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema fought back against an attack labeling her weak on sex offenders by calling GOP Rep. Martha McSally\u2019s campaign \u201cdesperate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019ll lie just to get elected, she\u2019ll lie about anything,\u201d a narrator says of McSally at the end of the ad. Sinema and McSally are in a toss-up contest.\n\nThe immigration and crime ads have reached a new peak in the waning days of the campaign, with Trump labeling a migrant caravan consisting largely of women and children an \u201cinvasion,\u201d and other Republicans picking up on the theme.", "When Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016, public trust in election polling \u2015 which systematically overstated her standing in key states \u2015 took a hit as well. Heading into the next election, many voters and pundits are still feeling apprehensive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more skeptical of polls now because of who ... is in the White House,\u201d Elthia Parker, a 79-year-old retiree, said at a Las Vegas rally late last month.\n\n\u201cIgnore the polls,\u201d political commentator Ana Navarro exhorted, a sentiment that racked up more than 10,000 retweets. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen them be wrong before.\u201d\n\nJust 37 percent of registered voters said in a survey last year that they had even a good amount of faith in public opinion research. Republicans were most likely to be skeptical. And those responses were from people who were willing to be polled.\n\nMost pollsters would agree with the skeptics that surveys are far from infallible. National polling, as pollsters are happy to remind anyone in earshot suggesting otherwise, wasn\u2019t actually that far off in 2016. Surveys largely predicted a modest popular vote win for Clinton. But it was a historically bad year for polls in states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which almost uniformly underestimated Donald Trump\u2019s chances and left much of the public blindsided by his win.\n\n\u201cThe number of times we\u2019ve had to reassure a client that the process still works and the number of skeptical questions I get when giving talks has certainly increased since 2016,\u201d Ashley Konig, the polling director at Rutgers University, noted in a recently published review of midterm polling.\n\nDistrust, she said, has hampered pollsters\u2019 job to provide an accurate depiction of public opinion. That and a slew of other challenges, from changing technology to rising costs, have driven pollsters to experiment with how they conduct surveys. Even more, distrust has ushered in a new focus on recalibrating public expectations about what horse-race polling can actually tell us ahead of an election.\n\n\u201cThe 2016 surprise clearly stung a lot of us who work in the field,\u201d said Scott Keeter, a senior adviser at Pew Research. \u201cPart of it is that national polling did a good job, but few people remember that. But there were real problems with some of the state polling, and owing to the often limited resources state pollsters have to work with, there\u2019s no guarantee that everything will go better this year or in 2020. Based on my conversations, some pollsters have made efforts to fix problems and a lot of creative work is being done. But off-year elections pose their own set of challenges, especially with respect to estimating likely turnout.\u201d\n\nWhat Went Wrong In 2016\n\nSix months after Trump\u2019s victory, a task force of pollsters released a report that acted in equal parts as a technical post-mortem and an existential defense of the industry.\n\n\u201cIt is ... a mistake to observe errors in an election such as 2016 that featured late movement and a somewhat unusual turnout pattern, and conclude that all polls are broken.\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cWell-designed and rigorously executed surveys are still able to produce valuable, accurate information about the attitudes and experiences of the U.S. public.\u201d\n\nTheir research found no evidence of a consistent bias toward one party in recent polling, they noted, nor that a cohort of \u201cshy\u201d Trump voters were deliberately hiding their choices from pollsters.\n\nInstead, there was a perfect storm of more prosaic issues \u2015 some potentially fixable, others less so, and some seemingly innate to the practice of polling itself. In the fixable camp: College graduates, who were more likely to support Hillary Clinton, were overrepresented in many polls.\n\nVoters with higher levels of education have always been more likely to answer surveys, but in past elections, where education was less of a partisan fault line, this proved less of an issue. Since then, a number of university pollsters who didn\u2019t already include education on the list of variables used to weight their results have begun doing so, although others have found the change to be less useful to their situations.\n\nMore intractable: State and district-level races often see relatively little polling, a problem that\u2019s certainly persisted through 2018. At the moment, Real Clear Politics\u2019 aggregation includes just three polls of the North Dakota Senate race taken since October. And although polls differed widely in how they were conducted, the report found little evidence that so-called \u201cgold standard polls,\u201d which use a traditional set of methodologies, were innately better-performing than the rest.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the problem that\u2019s plagued the industry since 1948, when pollsters like Gallup found Thomas Dewey winning tidily weeks before the presidential election \u2015 and then declared themselves done for the season, meaning they entirely missed the late movement toward Harry Truman.\n\nMost pollsters today wouldn\u2019t dream of hanging up their hats in early October. But they remain entirely vulnerable to the prospect of missing a last-minute swing in the electorate. That was a main factor in the 2016 elections, the polling report concluded, based on a review of exit polls that found voters in states like Wisconsin who made up their minds late went for Trump by far greater margins than those who chose earlier. (Again, polling being an inexact science, not everyone agrees on the magnitude or existence of that shift.)\n\nAAPOR\n\nThere\u2019s nothing to say that 2018, or future elections, won\u2019t once again feature a race that breaks late toward one side.\n\n\u201cI think the bottom line of what happened was that polling was just wrong enough nationally and at the state level that everyone got the wrong impression about what was going to happen,\u201d SurveyMonkey\u2019s Mark Blumenthal, a former polling editor at HuffPost, said last year. \u201cHopefully, if it happens again, we will all do a better job warning everyone that it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s Changed In 2018\n\nHeading into the 2018 election, there\u2019s been an effort to drive home that uncertainty by exposing the nuts and bolts behind every set of top-line numbers. Starting with 2017\u2032s off-year elections, several outlets took the still-unusual step of releasing multiple estimates for how a race might look, depending on which kinds of voters turn out.\n\nFiguring out who will turn out is always a challenge for pollsters, but particularly so in a year when Democrats are banking on supporters who are enthusiastic about this year\u2019s elections but haven\u2019t been reliable midterm votes in the past. Off-year elections in 2017 seemingly rewarded that gamble, prompting some pollsters to mull lowering the bar for including people without a strong voting history.\n\n\u201cWe do not know what the population is until Election Day,\u201d Monmouth pollster Patrick Murray, who has regularly released polls showing results for both high- and low-turnout scenarios, wrote earlier this year. \u201cWe are modeling a possibility.\u201d\n\nThe online survey firms SurveyMonkey and Ipsos have also released surveys with multiple turnout models; outlets including CBS and The Washington Post have presented readers with multiple estimates based on their polling.\n\nPerhaps the most extreme effort at transparency came from The New York Times\u2019 Upshot, which partnered with Siena College to release dozens of polls as they were being conducted. Although reactions focused mostly on the queasy thrill of watching a candidate\u2019s numbers grow or shrink in real time, the project also went to painful lengths to catalog the often-unspoken caveats that encumber every horse-race survey. Unanswered phone calls appear on district maps as a flood of empty circles, sampling error as a wide smear of color on a line graph of the results.\n\nTheir poll of the closely watched Texas Senate race, which gives Sen. Ted Cruz an 8-point lead, is peppered with provisos \u2015 \u201cIt\u2019s just one poll, though\u201d; \u201cEven after weighting, our poll does not have as many of some types of people as we would like\u201d; \u201cEven if we got turnout exactly right, the margin of error wouldn\u2019t capture all of the error in a poll\u201d; \u201cAssumptions about who is going to vote may be particularly important in this race.\u201d\n\nThose turnout assumptions lend themselves to estimates ranging from a 15-point lead for Cruz if the electorate looks like 2014, to a 3-point edge for Democratic challenger Beto O\u2019Rourke among only the people who say they\u2019re almost certain to vote.\n\nPollsters are also experimenting with different ways of identifying and reaching voters. Most media and academic pollsters who conduct phone surveys have traditionally relied on a method called random digit dialing \u2015 more or less what it sounds like \u2015 to reach respondents. Many still do.\n\nBut voter files, once largely the domain of campaign pollsters, have seen increasing adoption, especially at the state level. Voter files are built off of publicly available records of who\u2019s registered to vote and how often they do so, and supplemented by commercial vendors. Using them provides pollsters with unambiguous data on respondents\u2019 voting history, and allows them to keep track of what kind of people aren\u2019t responding to their polls.\n\nThere are potential drawbacks though \u2015 although voter files do include information on people who aren\u2019t registered to vote, that data can be spottier, carrying a risk of missing new voters.\n\nThe Upshot/Siena live polling made use of the voter file, and The Washington Post now uses a mix of the two methods for its state surveys. Also among those making the switch to a voter file this cycle was the venerable NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. Bill McInturff, the Republican half of the survey\u2019s bipartisan team of pollsters, described the move as \u201cthe most important change we made after 2016,\u201d noting that he and his Democratic counterpart have already seen the \u201cpowerful advantages\u201d of using the method to handle political campaigns.\n\nAnother of the biggest changes in polling this cycle won\u2019t be entirely felt until election night. For decades, the exit polls have been conducted through a consortium called the National Election Poll, consisting of The Associated Press and the major television networks, and relying heavily on in-person interviews at polling places across the country. This year, the AP and Fox News split from the consortium to launch an alternative called VoteCast, relying on interviews conducted just before the election \u2015 an approach the AP says \u201creflects how Americans vote today: not only in person, but also increasingly early, absentee and by mail.\u201d\n\nThe remaining members of the NEP and their pollster, Edison Research, have announced major changes of their own, including stationing pollsters at early voting centers and changing the way they ask about and incorporate data on voters\u2019 education levels.\n\nThe results of the 2016 election, contrary to the most glib critiques, don\u2019t mean that polling is broken. But they come at a time when the industry is already in flux. Response rates to surveys plummeted over the past three decades, as telemarketing-plagued Americans grew increasingly wary of unsolicited phone calls. That decline, which has since leveled off, wasn\u2019t enough to derail polling \u2015 people who still answer the phone, it turns out, are still largely similar enough to the ones who don\u2019t, and election polling doesn\u2019t seem to have grown any less accurate. But that shift, combined with the increasing ubiquity of cellphones, has made traditional polling more expensive than ever at a time when media sponsors and other clients are paring back. And it comes at a time when pollsters are facing both sky-high expectations for accuracy, and sky-high mistrust when they inevitably fail to meet them.\n\nPolls, and the forecasting models built off them, can provide a snapshot of the most likely set of outcomes for Tuesday\u2019s elections. And they do a far better job of it than yard signs, conversations with voters at small-town diners or pundits\u2019 gut feelings. But as 2016 made achingly clear, they can never offer any guarantee that the unlikely won\u2019t prevail.", "PENSACOLA, Fla. \u2015 Donald Trump keeps claiming that construction on his promised \u201cgreat wall\u201d is well underway although not a single yard of it has been built, and his supporters are getting mad \u2015 not at the president, but at those who point out his lie.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care. He has done more than any Republican or Democrat,\u201d said Pete Sandifer, a 58-year-old military retiree who with his wife drove two and a half hours from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, to attend Trump\u2019s rally in the far western Florida Panhandle.\n\nSharon Sandifer, 43, disputed that Trump has been unable to secure any funding for his wall along the U.S.-Mexico border from any source \u2015 a fact easily proven in the spending legislation that Trump himself has signed.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she told HuffPost a short while before Trump arrived at Pensacola International Airport for a Saturday evening rally. \u201cBut it\u2019s your word against his.\u201d\n\nRobert Robertson, in line to clear security and enter the massive hangar where Trump was to speak, was not interested in hearing about Trump\u2019s falsehoods about the wall \u2015 or anything else, for that matter.\n\n\u201cAll politicians are liars. They\u2019re all weasels,\u201d said the 60-year-old from Panama City. \u201cYou know why he\u2019s so good? Because he\u2019s up there breaking all the furniture. If he wanted to shoot somebody on Broadway, I\u2019d vote \u2018not guilty.\u2019\u201d\n\nRick Wilson, a Florida GOP consultant and a Trump critic from the time he entered the presidential race, said the Trump supporters who ignore his failure to deliver on the signature promise of his campaign \u2015 let alone get Mexico to pay for it, which he also promised \u2015 speak volumes.\n\n\u201cThey either think it\u2019s mostly built, or they think the Mexican check just hasn\u2019t cleared yet,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just magical thinking.\u201d\n\nTrump promised hundreds of times during his campaign that he would force Mexico to pay for the wall\u2019s construction. Yet nearly two years into his presidency, he has not even once broached the topic with that country. In fact, he acknowledged to Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto just days after taking office that he understood Mexico would not pay for the wall but asked Pe\u00f1a Nieto not to say that publicly to avoid embarrassing Trump with his supporters.\n\nS.V. Date/HuffPost Sharon and Pete Sandifer drove two and half hours from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, to see Trump speak in Pensacola Saturday night. She refuses to believe that Trump is lying when he claims work has started on his border wall. He says he doesn't care even if Trump is lying.\n\nThat promise of forcing Mexico to pay, first made the day Trump came down his Manhattan condo escalator to announce his campaign in June 2015, has now been abandoned. Instead, Trump has taken to claiming in recent months that Congress gave him $1.6 billion to start wall construction. He later increased that amount to $3.2 billion, and in recent speeches he has added a third $1.6 billion tranche, bringing the supposed total to nearly $5 billion.\n\nIn fact, the actual dollar amount Congress has appropriated for wall construction is zero.\n\nThere was $1.57 billion in the 2017-2018 spending bill to build and repair 33 miles of fencing along the southwest border and pay for some additional border security measures. However, the legislation specifically prohibited the construction of any form of structure that was not already in use in 2017.\n\nWith most of Trump\u2019s thousands of falsehoods, it is unclear whether he knows he is saying something untrue. Trump has proven to be deeply ignorant on any number of issues important to the presidency, so in many cases, a given falsehood could be a matter of him lacking information about a topic but forming a strong opinion nonetheless.\n\nBut on the matter of the wall, Trump does seem to understand that Congress has not provided any funding for its construction. In fact, he threatened to veto a massive $1.3 trillion spending package in March because it did not pay for his wall. He wound up signing it anyway, and said he did so because of all the money it contained for the military.\n\nTrump similarly signed an $853 billion spending bill in September to avoid a government shutdown just weeks before the midterm elections. That legislation also has no money for wall construction.\n\nDespite all of this, Trump has claimed that construction has begun on his wall in virtually every rally speech of late. He repeated the falsehood again in Pensacola Saturday night.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re building the wall. As you know. It started. We did $1.6 billion. We got another $1.6 billion, we\u2019re doing that. And we have another third, but I want to build it all at one time,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAnd his supporters, from elderly to first-time voters, said the lie did not bother them.\n\n\u201cTrump has really good intentions. And a lot of the things he says, I think he will do,\u201d said Abigail Mainor, an 18-year-old student at Northwest Florida College in nearby Niceville who said she will be casting her first ballot in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections. \u201cEveryone makes mistakes.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Pensacola visit was his second campaign stop in Florida in four days on behalf of former Jacksonville-area Rep.

The clause bars federal officials from accepting gifts or benefits from foreign officials or governments.\n\nThe case, filed by the attorneys general of Maryland and Washington, D.C., says Trump is skirting that prohibition by profiting from his Trump International Hotel in the District of Columbia, just blocks away from the White House.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) in a statement on Saturday as the panel\u2019s Republican majority released a 414-page report. \u201cIn the end, there was no credible evidence to support the allegations against the nominee.\u201d\n\nIn the accusation that gained the most public attention, California professor Christine Blasey Ford testified to the committee that when they were both teenagers, a drunk Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, tried to remove her clothing and pressed his hand over her mouth when she attempted to scream at a house party.\n\nYale University classmate Deborah Ramirez also said that a drunken Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party and thrust his penis into her face. Additionally, high school and college classmates said publicly before Kavanaugh was confirmed that he was a heavy drinker.\n\nKavanaugh in his testimony denied all of the allegations of sexual misconduct and disputed characterizations that he had a drinkng problem.\n\nAccording to the Senate Judiciary Committee report, six FBI reports on Kavanaugh over the course of his career in politics and on the bench \u2015 probes that included interviews with nearly 150 individuals who knew him \u2015 \u201cdid not reveal any alcohol abuse or inappropriate sexual behavior.\u201d\n\nThe report included speculation by two men that Ford may have mistaken them for Kavanaugh during innocent encounters decades ago. The names of the men were redacted.\n\nBefore Ford\u2019s testimony, conservative lawyer Ed Whelan suggested in a strange series of tweets that a classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s who looked like him may have assaulted her. President Donald Trump also gave credence to the theory. Ford said in her testimony that she was \u201c100 percent\u201d certain she was assaulted by Kavanaugh.\n\nGenerally, interviews in the committee report concerning Kavanaugh were glowing while questions were raised about Ford\u2019s credibility.\n\nOne person interviewed who claimed to know Ford said she did drugs on occasion. The type of drugs were not specified.\n\nAnother woman said she had seen an old photo of Ford with billionaire Democratic donor George Soros. Another said Ford had a \u201crobust\u201d social life and did not seem to be suffering from the effects of a sexual assault.\n\nThe report concluded: \u201cCommittee investigators found no verifiable evidence that supported Dr. Ford\u2019s allegations against Justice Kavanaugh. The witnesses that Dr. Ford identified as individuals who could corroborate her allegations failed to do so, and in fact, contradicted her.\u201d\n\nIn the Ramirez case, the report took note of a public statement by James Roche, who was Kavanaugh\u2019s roommate at Yale. He \u201ccharacterized Justice Kavanaugh as a \u2018notably heavy drinker, even by the standards of the time\u2019 who \u2018became aggressive and belligerent when he was very drunk,\u2019\u201d the report said.\n\nBut an unidentified classmate said Kavanaugh\u2019s drinking was \u201cwithin range of what was normal at the time.\u201d That classmate added that those who accused Kavanaugh of heavy drinking \u201cwere engaged in the same behavior.\u201d\n\nCommittee investigators \u201cfound no verifiable evidence to support Ramirez\u2019s allegations,\u201d the report stated.\n\nAs for Julie Swetnick, who told NBC that Kavanaugh was present in a house during high school when she said she was sexually assaulted, the committee \u201cfound no verifiable evidence to support\u201d her allegations.\n\nThe report added: \u201cIndeed, the evidence appears to support the position that Julie Swetnick and [her attorney, Michael] Avenatti criminally conspired to make materially false statements to the Committee and obstruct the Committee\u2019s investigation.\u201d\n\nTheir names have been forwarded to the Department of Justice and FBI for further investigation, according to the report.\n\nOther allegations with few details and largely unknown to the public were also dismissed by the committee.

Given the stakes for his presidency, he might as well be.\n\nA knot of investigations. Partisan gridlock. A warning shot for his re-election bid. Trump faces potentially debilitating fallout should Republicans lose control of one or both chambers in Congress, ending two years of GOP hegemony in Washington. A White House that has struggled to stay on course under favorable circumstances would be tested in dramatic ways. A president who often battles his own party, would face a far less forgiving opposition.\n\nOn the flip side, if Republicans maintain control of the House and Senate, that\u2019s not only a victory for the GOP, but a validation of Trump\u2019s brand of politics and his unconventional presidency. That result, considered less likely even within the White House, would embolden the president as he launches his own re-election bid.\n\nWhite House aides insist the president doesn\u2019t spend much time contemplating defeat, but he has begun to try to calibrate expectations. He has focused on the competitive Senate races the final days of his scorched-earth campaign blitz, and has distanced himself from blame should Republicans lose the House. If that happens, he intends to claim victory, arguing his efforts on the campaign trail narrowed GOP losses and helped them hold the Senate, according to a person familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking who asked for anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss White House conversations by name.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Trump has been testing out other explanations \u2014 pointing to historical headwinds for the party of an incumbent president and complaining about a rash of GOP retirements this year. He told the AP last month that he won\u2019t bear any responsibility should Democrats take over.\n\nAt a rally in West Virginia Friday a defiant Trump brushed off the prospect of a Democratic House takeover. \u201cIt could happen,\u201d he said, adding \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll just figure it out.\u201c\n\nMeanwhile his staff has begun preparations to deal with a flood of subpoenas that could arrive next year from Democrat-controlled committees and the White House counsel\u2019s office has been trying to attract seasoned lawyers to field oversight inquiries.\n\nShould they take the House, Democrats are already plotting to reopen the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. Other committees are plotting aggressive oversight of Trump\u2019s administration and his web of business interests. Some Democrats are looking at using the House Ways and Means Committee to obtain copies of the president\u2019s tax returns after he broke with decades of tradition and withheld them from public scrutiny during his campaign for the White House.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nA slim Republican majority in the House would also present challenges, likely inflaming simmering intraparty disputes. First among them would be a potentially bitter leadership fight in the House to replace retiring Speaker Paul Ryan. But a narrowed majority would also exacerbate divisions over policy \u2014 and continued unified control could leave the GOP facing the blame for gridlock.\n\n\u201cClearly there\u2019s an awful lot on the line in terms of the legislative agenda,\u201d said Republican consultant Josh Holmes. \u201cThe prospect of a Democratic controlled House or Senate puts a serious wrinkle in getting anything through Congress.\u201c\n\nSome in the White House think losing to Democrats might actually be preferable. They view Democrats\u2019 eagerness to investigate the president as a blessing in disguise in the run-up to 2020. They view House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as a potent foil for Trump, and believe they can tag the party responsibility for Washington dysfunction.\n\nAri Fleischer, George W. Bush\u2019s press secretary, said Democratic control of the House \u201chas both peril and promise for the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe peril is subpoenas, investigations, legal bills and headaches,\u201d he said. \u201cThe promise is Trump will have an easy foil to run against: Pelosi and Democratic leadership.\u201c\n\nWhite House aides have discussed floating popular legislative issues, like infrastructure, to tempt Democrats and test the unity of the Democratic opposition.\n\nWhile keeping the House remained an uphill battle for the GOP, in the closing days of the campaign, Trump and Republicans have tried to sell voters on the possibilities of another two years of GOP control. They promised hardline immigration policies and more tax cuts, arguing that Democrats would erase two years of progress.\n\nIn the closing weeks of the midterms, Trump has unleashed a no-holds-barred effort to boost Republicans as he dipped into the same undercurrents of unease that defined his 2016 campaign. From stoking fears about illegal immigration to warning of economic collapse if Democrats are victorious.\n\nBut a House loss will prompt GOP hand-wringing about the divides in the party and the struggles for moderate Republicans to run in the Trump, as well as raise questions about whether the Democratic gains point to a path for presidential hopefuls in 2020.\n\nDemocratic consultant Jim Manley said Tuesday may reveal if Democrats are having any success recapturing white working class voters in the Midwest who backed Trump in 2016.\n\n\u201cTrump is helping. He\u2019s becoming more and more radioactive,\u201d Manley said. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance to try and win them back over.\u201c\n\nBut while the results may reveal weaknesses in the Republican coalition, midterm elections are very different than presidential years. Republicans were quick to point out that the party in power typically suffers defeats in midterms.

The president is a dangerous authoritarian whose political party not only refuses to restrain him, but seems to take pleasure in emulating his most nihilistic impulses. The meaning of the midterms depends on whether the Democratic Party can win control of at least one chamber of Congress, allowing it to conduct official investigations and perform meaningful oversight.\n\nBut the midterms are also a critical test for the health of American democracy. And while we won\u2019t know the full story until Wednesday morning, there are some reasons for cautious optimism. Fear may be the most explosive force in our politics, but the most corrosive is apathy. So far, Americans appear to be responding to the Trump era with renewed political vigor.\n\nIn states that allow early voting, over 30 million ballots have already been cast, far surpassing the 20.5 million cast in 2014, with a few days left to go. New voter registration is smashing records in swing states including Colorado, Iowa and Virginia, all of which feature important congressional races. Surveys of interest and enthusiasm in the 2018 election indicate an electorate far more energized than it was four years ago. Fundraising from small donors is off the charts.\n\nThis is the sort of activity you would hope to see if you cared about the state of the world\u2019s most powerful democracy. It\u2019s also the sort of activity you\u2019d want to see if you are emotionally attached to the beleaguered Democratic Party.\n\nNationwide, 31 states and the District of Columbia register voters according to party. Among these, Democrats enjoy an advantage of nearly 12 million, according to the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. Democrats outnumber Republicans in 19 states, including West Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Louisiana and Florida. The 12 million figure almost certainly understates the scale of the Democratic advantage, since of the 19 states that do not register by party, many are solidly Democratic \u2015 Hawaii, Washington, Minnesota and Illinois \u2015 while still others \u2015 New Hampshire, Ohio, Wisconsin, Indiana, North Dakota, Missouri, Montana and, yes, Alabama \u2015 are currently represented by at least one Democratic official elected statewide. Of the 19 states that don\u2019t track party registration, only five \u2015 Mississippi, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee \u2015 don\u2019t currently feature a Democratic senator or governor.\n\nAnd yet. Twenty-six states exhibit unified Republican rule, while six more have a Republican governor and another six have a Republican-controlled state legislature. The Senate is split 51 to 49 and Republicans hold a 47-seat advantage in the House. When election day comes around, Democrats often have the voters, but not the votes.\n\nProfessional Democrats typically explain the gap between their registration advantage and their election-day results by emphasizing gerrymandering and voter suppression. It\u2019s a comforting narrative \u2015 Republicans win, but only because they cheat. And there is no doubt that gerrymandering and voter suppression are both very real, very destructive and very racist. Nationwide, Democratic candidates won 1,592,083 more votes than their Republican counterparts in 2012, yet Republicans secured 234 seats to Democrats\u2019 201. The tactics Republicans deploy to suppress the black vote seem endless.\n\nYou can\u2019t win seats you don\u2019t compete for.\n\nRepublicans resort to voter suppression and gerrymandering because it works. But Democrats have always had the ability to take the sting out of each by generating more enthusiasm and greater turnout. And they rarely deliver the goods. In 2014, only 36.7 percent of eligible voters bothered to show up, according to the United States Election Project at the University of Florida. In 2010, a wave year for Republicans, the figure was just 41 percent. Voter turnout hasn\u2019t eclipsed 50 percent in a midterm since 1914, but it took an 8.2 percentage point dive in 1974 \u2015 proportionally almost one-fifth \u2015 and never really recovered. Bumping turnout by just a few percentage points in prior elections could have been the difference between a Republican triumph and a Democratic wave, dirty tricks notwithstanding.\n\nPart of the problem is that Democrats just don\u2019t run. You can\u2019t win seats you don\u2019t compete for. In 2018, with the party in its weakest electoral position since the Civil War, a host of candidates decided to roll the dice on what seemed like long-shot bids in deep-red territory. In California\u2019s super-rich (median income: $93,995) 45th District, Katie Porter, an acolyte of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is running neck and neck with cut-my-property-taxes Republican Mimi Walters. In Virginia\u2019s 5th District \u2015 overwhelmingly rural territory gerrymandered to neutralize liberal votes in Charlottesville, lefty Leslie Cockburn is in a dead heat with her Bigfoot-friendly opponent Denver Riggleman.\n\nPorter and Cockburn aren\u2019t alone. A record number of women are running for office in 2018 \u2015 good news for the representational part of representational democracy. There are 256 women on the ballot in House and Senate races this year, 197 of them Democrats. The 183 Democratic women running for the House is more than 50 percent higher than the party\u2019s prior record of 120.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke will beat Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas or if Stacey Abrams will defeat Brian Kemp in Georgia. We don\u2019t know if Democratic challenger J.D. Scholten can dethrone white nationalist Republican Steve King in rural Iowa. But all of these races are solidly competitive heading into the final stretch, and Democratic Party leaders who scoffed at the idea of spending time and money in deep-red territory now look foolish. Democrats are running well in Kansas, and even the Oklahoma governor\u2019s race isn\u2019t a lock for Republicans.\n\nMuch of this new competitiveness has been enabled by a new fundraising model. After years of emulating Republican campaign finance strategies \u2015 targeting big donors and catering to their interests \u2015 Democrats seem to have at last figured out how to raise money from people who are not millionaires or billionaires. This cycle, they\u2019re out-raising Republicans more than 3-to-1 on donations of $200 or less. O\u2019Rourke alone has raised $31 million from small donors, a staggering sum for a Senate race. That\u2019s the money it takes to get the message out.\n\nSo what message will work? The midterms are about to test a bunch of different strategies. In the Senate, Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) and Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) are doing their best to survive in red states by yoking themselves to Trump \u2015 touting their support for his banking agenda and his anti-immigrant message. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) are pursuing the opposite approach, presenting themselves as unapologetic populist progressives in Trump territory. In Arizona, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema \u2015 one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress \u2015 is essentially running as Mitt Romney, while O\u2019Rourke is running as a progressive \u2015 some of his voting record to the contrary.\n\nWill all of this be enough to give Democrats a congressional majority? Most polling suggests that a House takeover is likely and a Senate switch is a long shot. But it all depends on who shows up to vote on Tuesday.

The march intended to call attention to black disenfranchisement in the South and followed the slaying of activist Jimmie Lee Jackson, who was shot by a state trooper during a peaceful civil rights protest.\n\nAt the rally, Lewis urged voters to show up to the polls for Abrams, saying voting is the \u201cmost powerful nonviolent\u201d instrumental tool in society.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking any of you to give any blood,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just asking you to go and vote like you never voted before.

By the end of the first quarter, the Golden State Warriors had run up a 20-point lead on the hapless and injured Chicago Bulls. By halftime, the Dubs had 92 points and were winning by 40. It was pointless. Except for Klay.\n\nExcept for Klay. Thompson, that is, the Warriors\u2019 gunner of two-guard who, up to that point in the season, had been trash. Thompson entered the evening having made just five of his first 36 three-point attempts of the season \u2015 a 14 percent clip that was nearly 30 points below his career average from distance. But on Monday, he reverted to his old, dumb self, which unlike Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant \u2015 his superstar teammates whose dominant nights always feel like reminders that they have absolutely broken basketball \u2015 tends to feel more normal. Klay is the old dude at the gym who uses screens the right way, finds himself in the corner, and pummels you with an endless barrage of buckets ... if that old dude was also 6\u20326\u2033 and one of the greatest shooters of all time.\n\nHe hit his first three less than 90 seconds into the game. By the end of the first quarter, he\u2019d made five more. At halftime, he had 10, and at one point, he had made nine out of 11 threes. He finished the game with 14, setting a single-game NBA record in just 27 minutes on the floor. He had 52 points.\n\nThe amazing thing about it, though, wasn\u2019t that he broke the record, but how. A Klay Game is a special phenomenon: on the occasions where Klay isn\u2019t just hot but reaches thermonuclear status, the Warriors\u2019 other superstars cease to even consider themselves a part of the game, and instead funnel the ball to him with a relentless, single-minded focus. So each time a Bulls shot clanked off the rim and landed in the hands of a Golden State player, they looked for Klay. In the corner. At the top of the key. Barely across half-court. It didn\u2019t matter. Curry and Durant were passing up open shots to find him. Draymond Green, on one possession, set five screens in an effort to free Thompson from his defenders. They still got theirs, but the night was Klay\u2019s, and they knew it.\n\nSo did the crowd. By the start of the second half, no one was paying attention to the score, or the Bulls. Not even their fans. Each time Klay touched the ball, the crowd urged him to shoot. Each time he did, the air burped with the anticipation that he was about to hit another one. And more often than not, it went in. The Warriors are dumb, and even though its cool in some circles to hate them now, I can\u2019t. Not when they play basketball like this. And not when they can decide, on any given night, to let Klay be Klay, and remind us that there are still endless wonders in an NBA season, even when its ultimate outcome already feels certain. \u2015 Travis Waldron\n\nKurt Russell As Cool Santa\n\nI don\u2019t really know how to explain the new trailer for \u201cThe Christmas Chronicles.\u201d There\u2019s Kurt Russell as cool Santa Claus throwing concerts in prison and bemoaning images on cola cans for making his butt look big.

If you haven\u2019t read Halliday\u2019s masterfully engineered debut yet, you should do the same thing.\n\nThe novel opens on the blossoming romance between Alice, a young editor at a publishing house in New York, and Ezra Blazer, an elderly acclaimed novelist who bears an unmistakeable resemblance to Philip Roth. Also an aspiring writer, Alice soaks up Ezra\u2019s attention and guidance, as he showers her with blackout cookies, rolls of cash to spend at upscale department stores, and sacks of edifying books to read. Rather than fully flipping a narrative so often told from the older male perspective on its head, Halliday relates it from a remove that hovers between clinical and whimsical, as if their relationship is a case file put into the language of a fairy tale.\n\nThen, just as Alice realizes she must choose between her own future as a writer or a real partnership with the ailing Ezra, Halliday throws us into another story. Amar Jaafari, an Iraqi-American economist, has been detained in Heathrow en route to see his brother in Kurdistan. In between dealing with the crushing bureaucracy \u2015 repeated interrogations that cycle through the same questions, vague and inexplicable explanations for his detention \u2015 he reflects on his life, the two countries that have been home to his family, and the violence that has surrounded his brother and other loved ones.\n\nThe novel ends with an eerily convincing transcript of a \u201cDesert Island Discs\u201d interview in which Ezra, some ten years on from the start of his relationship with Alice, recommends his all-time favorite songs, reminisces, and flirts with the interviewer.\n\nA dazzling puzzle box of a book, Asymmetry melds ambition and restraint in its exploration of power, artistic imagination, empathy, geopolitics, and love.

And every year, Caryn Coleman, director of programming and special projects at the theater, co-curates a midnight showing dedicated to mini horror flicks, the kinds that only require eight to 19 minutes to rattle your already fragile existence and catapult your adrenaline levels in glorious micro waves of fear.\n\nThis year\u2019s showing will take place on Thursday, Nov. 8 at 9:30 p.m. And its lineup is like a pleasant middle finger to Jason Blum, a man blithely unaware of the many female directors working in horror today.\n\n\u201cWhen I read the Jason Blum article I had watched two brand new horror films directed by women in the previous 24 hours,\u201d Coleman told HuffPost. \u201cGenre films by women is nothing new to me or to the many people clued into what\u2019s happening in horror. Therefore, what he said is a prime example of how out of touch certain parts of the film industry establishment are; they are completely unaware of a reality that is right in front of their face simply because they don\u2019t care enough to look.\u201d\n\nColeman and her co-programmer Sam Zimmerman have paid particular attention to women\u2019s voices at her festival over the years. \u201cThis year we\u2019re thrilled that our program not only features 70 percent female directors,\u201d she said, \u201cbut that nearly all address the real horror of what it\u2019s like to be a woman in the world.\u201d\n\nThree films to watch at the Shorts Festival\u2019s \u201cMidnite\u201d screening this year are \u201cRape Card,\u201d \u201cPumpkin Movie\u201d (\u201cI saw it the night of the Blasey-Ford testimony and it was utterly prescient, couldn\u2019t get it out of my head,\u201d Coleman said), and \u201cCat Calls.\u201d Tickets are on sale here. \u2015 Katherine Brooks\n\nRos\u00e9 In October\n\nNestled halfway into Quavo\u2019s new album, \u201cQuavo Huncho,\u201d is a track that dares to bring ros\u00e9 out of the summer slums and into the autumn breeze. Understanding the pink-tinted bubbly should be a year-round affair, \u201cChampagne Ros\u00e9\u201d had the rapper \u201cpoppin\u2019 bottles\u201d in \u2014 gasp! \u2014 October. More significantly, he did so with the help of two incredible collaborators. One of them (Cardi B) comes as no surprise; the other (Madonna) is a left-field swerve that proves to be one of the record\u2019s highlights.\n\nDominating the song with a high-pitched autotune, Madonna\u2019s is the first voice we hear. She stretches \u201cchampagne\u201d to three syllables and turns wine into sex the way only she can (\u201cPlease drink me up\u201d). Her presence is the yin to Quavo\u2019s full-throated yang, perfectly accentuated by a flute that graces the intoxicating beat. And then, before the four-minute bop ends, Madonna nails a verse that again lets her bend and elongate words with a crisp, clarion cadence: \u201cLet me entertain you / Get inside your vein, too / Intoxicate your brain, ooh / Crazy, what I\u2019ll make you.\u201d It\u2019s a frothy morsel, likely to remain an under-appreciated footnote in all three artists\u2019 repertoires. But listen to it and try not to hit the repeat button a dozen times. You can\u2019t do it. \u2015 Matthew Jacobs\n\nWitch Hunting\n\nHalloween may be over, but witches rule all year long. If you haven\u2019t yet checked out two spooooky witchy reboots \u2015 The CW\u2019s \u201cCharmed\u201d and Netflix\u2019s \u201cChilling Adventures of Sabrina\u201d \u2015 the time is now. Both series take beloved \u201990s shows and turn them into something darker, more complex and more overtly feminist. Neither show is perfect, but they both have done something interesting and timely \u2015 and, dare we say ... magical? Plus, with all the talk of \u201cwitch hunting\u201d powerful white men, it\u2019s about damn time we saw some real witchy women get their due. \u2015 Emma Gray\n\nMartha Rosler Forever\n\nIn the 1975 video \u201cSemiotics of the Kitchen,\u201d one of multidisciplinary artist Martha Rosler\u2019s most famed works, Rosler stands at a makeshift kitchen station in front of a refrigerator and stove. It looks like a cross between a Rachael Ray cooking demo and a Francesca Woodman photograph.\n\n\u201cApron,\u201d she says, as she pulls one over her head. \u201cBowl,\u201d displaying a bowl to the world while pantomiming stirring. \u201cChopper,\u201d plunging it into the bowl violently. \u201cEgg beater ... fork ... grater,\u201d she continues, rubbing the fork up and down the grater, emitting a jarring racket. She continues down the alphabet, naming different kitchen appliances and simulating their use for the viewer like an alien mimicking domestic rituals. When she picks up the nutcracker, Rosler glares at the viewer while spreading and shutting the tool\u2019s legs with vigor. The video, critiquing the oppressive, domestic roles women are often forced to embody, becomes a jagged dance to the tune of a grating metallic symphony.\n\nThis is Rosler\u2019s most well-known piece, but far from the only one worth knowing. A retrospective at the Jewish Museum spans Rosler\u2019s five-decade career. Featuring installations, photographic series, sculpture, and video, the exhibit probes far beyond \u201cSemiotics of the Kitchen\u201d to show us one of the most witty and dogged feminist artists of our time. In one photo collage, blond women snap selfies in a mod mansion as flames blaze outside the windows. In an installation, various women\u2019s lingerie and sleepwear congregate around a white mattress. The cluster of thongs and spanx and granny panties alludes to the stories clothes tell about the women who wear them. Or perhaps just the stories we buy into.\n\nThe show opens on Friday, Nov. 2 and is up until March. All feminists, Jews and bad chefs are encouraged to attend. \u2015 Priscilla Frank\n\nThe Drawing of Lines\n\nScreenshot", "Ryan Reynolds\u2019 trolling days are far from over.\n\nThe \u201cDeadpool\u201d actor recently shared a video on Twitter featuring a fake political attack ad against fellow actor Hugh Jackman, adding to their history of hilarious online exchanges.\n\nThe video, \u201cpaid for by not Ryan Reynolds,\u201d asks awards voters to consider \u201cfacts\u201d about Jackman before they judge his performance in new movie \u201cThe Front Runner.\u201d\n\nHow well do you really know @RealHughJackman? pic.twitter.com/cV0W7C4LE3 \u2014 Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) November 2, 2018\n\n\u201cHugh Jackman isn\u2019t his real name, it\u2019s Hugh Michael Jackman,\u201d the ad charged.\n\nThe faux attack ad then argued \u201cThe Wolverine\u201d actor would deliver a \u201cpreachy liberal speech\u201d at an awards ceremony, before suggesting another actor \u201cfrom a bordering country\u201d would be better suited for the honor \u2015 Reynolds, of course.\n\nBut the \u201cattack ad\u201d was really promotion for his friend who plays Democratic politician Gary Hart in the new film, which hits select theaters on Election Day, Nov. 6.\n\nNonetheless, Jackman responded to Reynolds\u2019 trolling with a video of his own.\n\nThe Australian actor shared an Instagram video showing him scoop his dog\u2019s poop from a photo of Reynolds as Deadpool.", "TALLAHASSEE, Fla.

Following the death of Marie, the realms fall into disarray and discord with the treacherous Fourth Realm apparently threatening to tear everything apart.\n\nClara, who inherited her mother\u2019s technical chops and dreamy nature, is sent into the realms to restore order, where she must navigate a treacherous scene of shifting alliances and political intrigue, venture into lands populated by insane Matryoshka clowns and mouse tornadoes, and come to grips with her grief over her mother\u2019s loss.\n\nOn paper, the movie has a lot going for it, including composer James Newton Howard adapting Tchaikovsky\u2019s inimitable score, dancing from the legendary Misty Copeland and performances from the likes of Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and Keira Knightley.\n\nUnfortunately, the real world has snapped the story right out of its fantasy. Early reviews have been lackluster, with the tale of the four realms proving to be as hollow as the tin soldiers sent into the battle of toys. Is there still hope for this ballet adaptation? Or is it tragically out of step? HuffPosters Bill Bradley and Claire Fallon dig into the highs and lows of \u201cFour Realms\u201d below.\n\nBill: Claire, we\u2019ve both now seen Disney\u2019s new live action movie, \u201cThe Nutcracker And The Four Realms.\u201d What are your initial thoughts? It was certainly nuts.\n\nClaire: Both nuts and crackers! This movie was so all over the place, it\u2019s hard to land on any neat takeaways. My very first initial impression was of intense dizziness. This film begins with a swooping camera spiraling through the London airspace, and there are lots of other aerial arabesques throughout. Turns out this technique makes me slightly nauseous, so I spent a lot of the movie limply sprawled in my seat, fighting vertigo. Am I the only person who reacts to movies this way? Am I too fragile to consume contemporary culture?\n\nPutting that aside, I was also dizzy throughout the movie because I never really had any idea what was going on or why. What did you think of the action-packed new twist on the \u201cNutcracker\u201d narrative?\n\nDisney\n\nBill: Whenever the terrifying nesting egg clowns started opening themselves up, revealing even more terrifying nesting egg clowns, I knew this movie wasn\u2019t for me. That being said, there are things people can enjoy. Keira Knightley has cotton candy hair. That\u2019s cool. Misty Copeland\u2019s ballet dancing speaks for itself. One of the moms beside me seemed to like the shirtless guy dancing in the credits. So there\u2019s that. But those clowns, man. That\u2019s some \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d-level shit. Let\u2019s back up a bit though, how did you feel about when we were introduced to Clara and her family?\n\nClaire: Bill, I have a lot of feelings. When we meet Clara, she\u2019s in the attic setting an elaborate Rube Goldberg-esque mousetrap and explaining each scientific force involved to her little brother, Fritz. See, Clara isn\u2019t just a girl: She\u2019s an inventor and a scientist. The \u201cgirl power\u201d messaging here felt a little shoehorned in, but I\u2019m a sucker for a Violet Baudelaire type. Then we learn that Clara\u2019s mother has recently died, and she has been avoiding her family \u2015 her father, Tom from \u201cSuccession\u201d Mr. Stahlbaum (Matthew Macfadyen), her older sister Louise (Ellie Bamber), and Fritz (Tom Sweet) \u2015 because she hates their attempts to continue life with some normalcy.\n\nThe family gathers around the Christmas tree, and everyone makes a lot of heavy comments about how different it is now that mom is gone while Tom the father gazes dolefully into the middle distance. He gives the older sister her late mother\u2019s favorite dress, and when Louise puts it on for a ball that evening, he directs a lingering, longing stare at her that only makes it more unsettling when he then insists on dancing with both his daughters at the party. The vibe is very pre-war purity ball. Why do they spend so much time talking about whether he\u2019ll get a dance with his teenage daughters? Did something about this family portrait feel, uh, off to you?\n\nThe vibe is very pre-war purity ball. Why do they spend so much time talking about whether he\u2019ll get a dance with his teenage daughters?\n\nBill: There\u2019s a lot going on with this family. First of all, was that really the mom\u2019s favorite dress? I looked back through my notes and one of the things I wrote was, \u201cWhy mom dress so ugly?\u201d I don\u2019t know much about style, but to me it looked like a dress from a rejected American Girl Doll, if that doll was also a zombie. I think that should\u2019ve already been a sign that things were going to get weird (see clowns above). I\u2019m sure the dancing thing was meant to be sweet, but the dad was just a little too insistent. Look, the family is going through a hard time. They\u2019re in a Disney movie. Disney\u2019s got a thing for killing off moms. I get it. It was just a bit uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, on the way to the party, after the dad calls dibs on dances with both his daughters, Fritz is like, \u201cWho will dance with me?\u201d And everyone just laughs, just mercilessly mocks this little kid. Clearly they\u2019re saying Fritz isn\u2019t cool enough to dance with anyone. Stupid Fritz. But I wasn\u2019t sure why it was so funny, and it made me worried about the rest of the movie. What\u2019d you think when they finally arrived at Drosselmeyer\u2019s, aka Morgan Freeman, who is apparently some kind of pirate?\n\nClaire: I laughed frequently during this movie, but rarely when the movie believed it had made a joke.\n\nOn a visual level, Drosselmeyer\u2019s was a high point for me: a rambling old mansion, a ballroom filled with dancing couples, a steampunk workshop. Drosselmeyer is Clara\u2019s godfather and cared for her mother after she herself was orphaned, and despite the pirate gear and suspiciously cryptic comments, he does seem to be a good dude. He also made the silver egg that Clara received from her parents (instead of an old hand-me-down dress like poor Louise); her mother left her the egg with a message saying everything she needs is inside.\n\nThe climax of Drosselmeyer\u2019s party is the presentation of gifts to all the kids, which they have to find throughout the house by following ribbons tagged with their names. Fritz\u2019s gift is a nutcracker soldier, which he waves in Clara\u2019s face while hooting, \u201cIt\u2019s your boyfriend!\u201d Look, I had brothers, and they never teased me by suggesting that I was dating their Legos, but OK. We still have to deal with the fact that young girls in what appears to be Victorian-era England did not have \u201cboyfriends.\u201d Anachronism alert!\n\nDrosselmeyer\u2019s Christmas gift to Clara is the key that will open her fancy egg. However, he basically leaves her the key in a fantasy realm which she enters magical-portal-style, where it is promptly stolen before her very eyes by a marauding mouse. Why did he handle this in such a risky way? And, more importantly, what did you think of her introduction to the Four Realms?\n\nDisney\n\nBill: First, I just want to mention that Drosselmeyer, who seems to have spent all his time tinkering in the basement with an invention that doesn\u2019t work right and talking to an owl, still has time to set up an elaborate string maze for all the kids at the party to follow around his crazy house to find their presents. That\u2019s time management.\n\nAnd wow, to paraphrase one of the iconic moments in \u201cVenom,\u201d so many realms, so little time. There\u2019s some sort of anthropomorphic flower man in charge of the Flower Realm; an icicle dude running the Snow Realm; Keira Knightley and her accent running the Realm of Sweets; and Helen Mirren as Mother Ginger towering over the Fourth Realm in a giant robot that\u2019s infested with mice. Did I miss any? Yes, I looked them up on Wikipedia to make sure I had them straight. This movie\u2019s got realms on realms on realms. Bummed there\u2019s not even more realms? Check under your seat! You get a realm! You get a realm! Everybody gets a realm!\n\nApparently, it was Clara\u2019s mom who put all this realm madness together. What do you think about the impact her mom had on the realms and Clara\u2019s journey?\n\nClaire: I think it\u2019s actually the Realm of Snowflakes (way more whimsical than Snow). Please be precise! Also, pretty sad that Drosselmeyer just couldn\u2019t get his invention to work, and then Clara fixed it in three seconds. I know she\u2019s a genius, but he\u2019s a much more experienced genius.\n\nSo yes, let\u2019s talk about the superbrain behind all this: Clara\u2019s mom, Marie. According to Sugar Plum (Keira Knightley), the denizens of the Four Realms were all lifeless toys until Marie invented an engine that, through the power of physics and engineering, magically transformed them into living creatures with feelings. Yes: This is a movie about the ethics of artificial intelligence and the singularity. A twist I genuinely didn\u2019t see coming!\n\nYes: This is a movie about the ethics of artificial intelligence and the singularity. A twist I genuinely didn\u2019t see coming!\n\nI was left at sea as to the details: Did the realms exist before the engine? Did Marie invent the other world as well as the toy people inside it? Who is really in charge here? And if the leaders of the realms are just lackeys for Marie, the queen of everything, how did they function during the long stretches of time while she was with her family? Clara learns that time passes much more quickly within the realms, such that the party is still going when she returns after what feels like weeks of adventuring. So if her mom left long enough to, say, go to sleep or have a baby, it seems like years would probably pass in the realms.\n\nBut Marie\u2019s death has really thrown this world into disarray: The resulting political instability during her unexplained absence is what separated the Fourth Realm from the other three, and only Princess Clara\u2019s reemergence offers any hope of unity again.\n\nCan we talk about the Nutcracker, by the way? The whole movie is named after him, and I keep forgetting he was even there.\n\nDisney\n\nBill: You mean the Captain, aka Phillip, aka Mr. Irrelevant? I liked the nutcracker. He seemed like a solid dude, and when he opened the simple bridge gate by going through all these elaborate steps \u2015 that was my favorite part. That and when Keira Knightley says, \u201cOh poo.\u201d But why is he even in this story? It\u2019s clear from the start this is about all realms all the time. Even when he goes with the mouse to warn Mother Ginger later in the movie, I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy is he going? Couldn\u2019t the mouse just tell her?\u201d Maybe Clara realizes he\u2019s irrelevant too and is like, \u201cI\u2019m done with this sad boy. Better send him to Mother Ginger so I can kick soldier ass with actual kicks.\u201d\n\nClaire: Captain Philip, self-proclaimed only nutcracker in the kingdom even though there are a lot of other soldiers who look pretty much the same so what toys are they made from, is very nice. He\u2019s too good for Clara, frankly. As soon as he finds out she\u2019s a princess and bows to her, she makes a hobby of ordering him cheekily into danger. She insists that they cross into the Fourth Realm, over his frantic objections, only to agree that it\u2019s too dangerous as soon as SHE sees something freaky. \u201cThat\u2019s an order, Captain!\u201d How fun! She always grins extra-wide while issuing orders to him, like it\u2019s a cute little game that she can send him to his death and he will obey without protest. They have a quasi-romantic friendship vibe throughout, and if I were Clara I would probably try to take it to the next level because he\u2019s very handsome, but nothing happens.\n\nShall we talk about the big twist, where it turns out Sugar Plum is evil? Whoops, spoiler! I think I actually liked Evil Keira better than Elfin Keira. What did you think?\n\nBill: There was one scene where to show Elfin Keira has wings, she laughs and pops her wings out, flies up, and flies down. And it\u2019s like ... uh, OK. Moving on. But Evil Keira? Like she says about boys in uniform, she sends a quiver right through me. Can we talk about all the adult jokes she starts cracking?\n\nClaire: Discourse about threatening female sexuality was invented in preparation for Evil Keira. As soon as she commandeers the life-giving engine to animate tin soldiers (which, inexplicably, do not behave like any of the other animated toys), she turns from sugar baby to unapologetic size queen! When Clara points out with horror that the transformed tin soldiers are enormous, Keira drawls, \u201cI know, isn\u2019t it magNIFicent?\u201d I should also add that she says it\u2019s boys in uniform, with weapons, that send a quiver right through her. Mmm, sexually aroused by weapons. Truly chilling.\n\nWhat about another performance we haven\u2019t much discussed, Mackenzie Foy as Clara? Were you impressed?\n\nDisney\n\nBill: The biggest issue for me was the moment she realized her mom wanted her to know that everything she needs is inside of her. She stares at a mirror in a music box, looking at her own face, but she juuuuust can\u2019t quite get there. In my head, I was just pleading, \u201cEverything you need is inside you! C\u2019mon, dude, you\u2019re the cleverest person around! For the love of God it\u2019s all inside you!\u201d I felt like I lived a thousand lifetimes in that moment. The horrible clowns were jumping out of their own bodies; Keira Knightley was becoming a size queen over and over; and it was all happening in slow motion. Time was a flat circle. But thank Mother Ginger, she eventually she did put it together. For me, that was more of a story thing than acting, but how did you feel about the performances overall?\n\nClaire: Yes, that was a frustrating moment \u2015 but not quite as infuriating, to me, as when she first opens the egg and finds nothing but a beautiful tune playing. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here!\u201d she spits, disgusted. Her mom promised everything she needed would be inside! I\u2019m not sure what she expected to find, but maybe a tiny living version of her mom? A pocketknife, but one of the really good ones with a bottle-opener attachment and little tweezers?\n\nBut OK, that\u2019s on the story, not Foy. Still, I mostly found her performance pretty blank, which is unfortunate since she\u2019s the lead. She has one expression, with a slightly open mouth and tilted head, for when she\u2019s feeling confused, curious, sad, or annoyed, and then a broad grin for when she\u2019s taunting Captain Philip. In the final frenetic battle scene, Clara has to take on droves of tin soldiers almost singlehanded, unarmed, and she polishes them all off with well-timed kicks and punches, but she doesn\u2019t sell the martial arts prowess. I actually wrote in my notes, \u201cI am not convinced Clara could kick anyone\u2019s ass unless the choreography demanded it.\u201d Any other broad takeaways from \u201cFour Realms\u201d?\n\nThe movie actually kind of just stops at one point so everyone can watch the dancing and eat their cotton candy hair. It needed more of that.\n\nBill: Not a lot, except that I think the spirit of the mom is trapped inside the owl. But I don\u2019t want to get into it. Like I said earlier, one of the moms in the theater really liked the dancing at the end, and the dancing throughout is obviously spectacular. The movie actually kind of just stops at one point so everyone can watch the dancing and eat their cotton candy hair. It needed more of that. More cotton candy hair and dancing. Less karate kid moves and sad boys. And the mom is an owl. What about you? Who would you recommend this to?\n\nClaire: I would argue that the spirit of the mom is not trapped inside the owl, because at one point Drosselmeyer refers to the mom as \u201cshe\u201d in conversation with the owl. Perhaps the owl is her old familiar? Is she a witch? TBD. The best parts of \u201cFour Realms,\u201d sadly, are the parts that you could get elsewhere: Tchaikovsky\u2019s incredible score, and Misty\u2019s ballet moves. There are two significant Misty sequences, one in a Three Realms ballet that is meant to tell the story of the land\u2019s history, and one in the credits. Her performance is so fluid and graceful, I couldn\u2019t look away. I just wish the camera didn\u2019t keep forcing me to look away \u2015 there were a lot of cuts to close-up during the ballet scenes that I thought detracted from the flow of the dancing.\n\nBefore my mom died when I was a kid, we used to go see the local ballet company perform \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d every holiday season. If you\u2019re a parent with young kids, I recommend that instead. If you\u2019re a Keira superfan, definitely check out her deranged sex maniac fairy turn in \u201cFour Realms.\u201d", "At least two people are dead after a partial building collapse on Friday night at an Amazon warehouse in Baltimore.\n\nBaltimore Fire Chief Roman Clark told The Baltimore Sun and WBAL that rescuers pulled one man out from under debris at the North America Sortation Center on Friday, but he died at the hospital. They recovered the body of a second man on Saturday, Clark said.\n\nA 50-foot wall collapsed at the facility, which is located in southeast Baltimore, at around 10:30 p.m. on Friday.\n\nOfficials are unaware of any other injuries but are continuing to assess the scene.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going through the rest of the debris to be sure no one else is there,\u201d Clark told the Sun.\n\nThe Baltimore City Fire Department did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nEmployee Brandon McBride told WBAL that when the wall fell, it sounded like \u201cbombs were dropping.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was stuff falling everywhere, you could see the walls were caving in,\u201d he said. \u201cRain was pouring everywhere; all the packages were soaked. It\u2019s unreal.\u201d", "President Donald Trump could learn a thing or two from former President Barack Obama about how to handle hecklers.\n\nTrump has infamously encouraged supporters to \u201cknock the crap\u201d out of people who protest him at rallies. Obama showed how it should be done Friday, however, when he was heckled while stumping for Democratic candidates Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum in Miami, Florida, ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterms.\n\n\u201cSir, sir, don\u2019t curse in front of kids, come on. Don\u2019t do that in front of them, come on,\u201d Obama calmly told one heckler.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re OK, we\u2019re OK, we\u2019re OK,\u201d Obama continued, after the unidentified person was reportedly removed by security and the crowd stopped chanting the ex-POTUS\u2019 name.\n\n\u201cYou know what? This is what I look forward to, is having a few hecklers to get me back in the mood. You know, it\u2019s like, I enjoy that. You always gotta have a few in order to know that you\u2019re on the campaign trail,\u201d he said.\n\nObama used similar tactics to thwart a second heckler, who interrupted his comments on health care.\n\n\u201cHold on a second. Sir, sir. Here\u2019s the deal, if you support the other candidates, then you should go support the other candidates. Don\u2019t be here,\u201d said Obama, before telling the heckler to not \u201ccome hollering here.\u201d", "Liuba Grechen Shirley may just be painting Long Island blue.\n\nThe 37-year-old Democratic candidate for the U.S. House is taking on a Long Island institution in the midterm elections: 26-year Republican Rep. Peter King. In her aggressive campaign to win in New York\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, she\u2019s managed to turn some staunch Republicans and past King voters into supporters.\n\nKing hasn\u2019t faced a real Democratic challenger in over a decade. But Grechen Shirley\u2019s campaign is giving him a fight.\n\nGrechen Shirley\u2019s campaign has raised more than $1.3 million from more than 7,500 donors in her election cycle \u2014 more than any King challenger before and more than King\u2019s past five challengers combined. Additionally, she\u2019s gotten public support from figures like Long Island\u2019s own Amy Schumer, the New York Times Editorial Board, and Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.). Videos of King continually interrupting her at one of his first public debates in eight years went viral.\n\nThis is how Peter King views his constituents. This is how he treats us. I will not stop talking about how Peter King's record hurts Long Islanders\u2014no matter how many times he interrupts me. pic.twitter.com/egVnY8pJFU \u2014 Liuba Grechen Shirley (@liuba4congress) October 26, 2018\n\nPolling experts say it\u2019s unlikely but not impossible for her to topple the giant, according to WABC-TV. Recent polling shows King ahead by about 5 percentage points, with FiveThirtyEight.com giving him a 5 in 7 chance of winning.\n\nGrechen Shirley made waves before her campaign even gathered steam when she successfully petitioned the Federal Election Commission to use her campaign funds for child care while she ran in the Democratic primary. In a Washington Post op-ed in April, she asked, \u201cWant women to run for Congress? We need someone to watch our kids first.\u201d\n\nHer openness about being a mother combined with her support of a $15 federal minimum wage, climate change action, student debt relief and Medicare for all have made her an attractive candidate even to those who usually vote on the other side of the aisle.\n\nAline Bowen, a native of Massapequa Park, was a born and raised Republican. She told HuffPost in August that she\u2019ll be voting for Grechen Shirley.\n\n\u201cI was born a Republican. So, when you went into the booth, you just hit Republican and it didn\u2019t matter what it was \u2015 I had no clue what it stood for. I didn\u2019t listen to the news. But now I listen. I pay attention,\u201d Bowen said.\n\nBowen told HuffPost that her daughter, who had cancer, inspired her to get involved. Bowen said that when her daughter turns 26 and must get her own health insurance, she\u2019ll be \u201cscrewed\u201d if the government has \u201caxed out pre-existing conditions.\u201d\n\nKing has not been quiet about his distaste for the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, voting to repeal it nine times. Under Obamacare, health insurance companies can\u2019t refuse to cover you or charge you more if you have a \u201cpre-existing condition,\u201d which is a health problem you\u2019ve had prior to the date that your new health coverage begins. As of October, many Republicans \u2015 including King \u2015 have been saying, despite their votes to repeal, that they want to defend the act\u2019s protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nBowen said she voted for Obama in 2008 and didn\u2019t vote in 2012 because she was sick in 2012. She says she \u201cnever, ever\u201d voted in the \u201clittle\u201d elections because, \u201cWhy bother?\u201d But Trump\u2019s win changed that.\n\n\u201cWhen Trump got elected, I thought it was absolutely ridiculous. I hate the man. I can\u2019t stand him,\u201d said Bowen. \u201cI had to step over to the other side, the nicer side.\u201d\n\nLiuba Grechen Shirley/Facebook Liuba Grechen Shirley, 37, speaks to a voter in New York's 2nd Congressional District.\n\nOther Long Islanders with Republican leanings have made a similar shift. HuffPost spoke to several who said they\u2019d be voting for Grechen Shirley despite past support for King.\n\nBonni Watson Pope and Donna Kimick from Massapequa Park told HuffPost that, although they\u2019re both registered Democrats, they\u2019d voted for King in past elections.\n\n\u201cI used to vote for King because we thought he was decent. Since the 2016 election, King has turned on us. Not many choices on [Long Island] then,\u201d Pope told HuffPost. \u201cSince Liuba is running, I adore her.\u201d\n\nPope, 70, told us that she thought King used to care about Long Island, but now cares only about Trump.\n\n\u201cWe had no one running that deserved our vote other than him. That has radically changed,\u201d Pope said. \u201cHe is all about acting like other [Republicans].\u201d\n\nKimick said she used to vote for King \u201cmainly because I didn\u2019t know who the other person was running against him and knew of him from church.\u201d That changed after the last election when \u201ceverything spiraled out of control.\u201d\n\n\u201cI became more involved, educated and more aware,\u201d Kimick said. She was inspired by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s post-election book, What Happened, when she read it over the summer. In the book, Clinton counseled Americans to look at local elections to \u201cfix things,\u201d so when Kimick\u2019s son told her about Grechen Shirley\u2019s campaign, she researched her candidacy.\n\nKimick, who has an 18-year-old daughter and 27-year-old son, said Grechen Shirley\u2019s views on health care and student loans have appealed to her because of her children. Of King, Kimick said, she didn\u2019t think he was a \u201cterrible person,\u201d but that \u201cit\u2019s time for someone younger and more motivated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to change things. The government is becoming old white men. We can\u2019t let them make the rules anymore,\u201d she said, before adding that, if she could tell undecided voters in this district anything, it would be: \u201cThink about your children. Think about your future grandchildren.\u201d\n\nKimick said King supporters should \u201clook at his record\u201d and ask, \u201cHas he done anything for you personally?\u201d", "It\u2019s just cannabis, right? How important can something affectionately referred to as \u201cwacky-tabbacky\u201d be? In my case, very.\n\nIn 2015, I nearly died from a vitamin B12 deficiency (because that\u2019s a thing), which catapulted an evil disease called fibromyalgia into the center of my world \u2015 and then totally imploded it. I was completely debilitated and lucky to leave my sickbed once a week. There is no way I would have gotten through the worst of it without cannabis to manage both my symptoms and the depression that came with them. No. Fucking. Way. (But, of course, you should always consult your own physician or mental health professional before trying any drug or medication.) It was an incredibly hard time, to put it mildly.\n\nFinally, after two and a half intense-yet-dull years of medical tests, bedrest, physical therapy and intensive self-care, I was healthy enough that rejoining the working world started to seem like an option. I was homeless at the time after moving to the warm Los Angeles area from rainy Portland at the advice of a doctor. I hadn\u2019t been able to find affordable housing or reliable work I could physically perform. I was starting to accept the idea that I\u2019d be a homeless cover letter-writer for the rest of my days. Then, miraculously, an incredible job landed in my lap.\n\nAfter posting about my beloved cannabis on Instagram, a follower-turned-friend introduced me to the manager of a nearby dispensary who then kindly hired me to do their marketing for as many hours as I could handle (whew!). Sadly, the position was phased out of existence after six months due to budgetary restrictions. But it was a brilliant introduction to the industry and helped me get back on my feet.\n\nHere are a few things I learned during my first professional stint in the weed industry:\n\nIt\u2019s like working for any other business: I don\u2019t know what I expected on my first day \u2015 I\u2019m sure images of the police showing up (never saw one) and the sounds of reggae (which I did hear! along with all kinds of tunes) ran through my head \u2015 but I know I didn\u2019t imagine the Keurig machine. In many ways it was, surprisingly, like any other job I\u2019ve had: It involved a very typical management structure; there was software to learn; we attended morning meetings; and there were never quite enough (or the right) office supplies in stock. All in all, it was totally the standard stuff you\u2019d encounter in any other workplace.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing like working for any other business: On the other hand \u2015 oh look, there\u2019s a big stack of cash, video cameras and armed guards and, of course, ginormous bags of herb! I got to weigh and package the cannabis buds (known as \u201cflower\u201d), and playing with cannabis while chatting with customers was definitely unlike any experience at an office I\u2019ve ever had. Even after time began to be filled with duties typical of a more traditional marketing position, I still often found it hard to believe I was getting paid to do things like describe the particular high of a cannabis strain or take photos of herb. I even got to create a giant cannabis painting for a photo-op background.\n\nPeople can be real jerks about getting their cannabis: I assumed our customers would be all chill and thrilled to be at their local weed store. Nope! My guess is that some of the crankier people who visited the store were folks in need of cannabis for medicinal use, and being sick is always an understandable reason for crankiness \u2015 especially if we didn\u2019t have what they needed in stock. We had lots of friendly, laid-back visitors to the dispensary \u2015 the majority, in fact, were that way \u2015 but I was still surprised by the noticeably high jerk ratio. (Still, I\u2019d bet most of them were much more likable once they were able to enjoy our product...)\n\nBut it has good people: I\u2019ve worked in many offices and generally felt like a weirdo, even before I started dying my hair purple. But I never felt like an outsider at my dispensary. Hugs were given out on the regular and it was safe to tell stories and share opinions without having to majorly censor yourself. So far I\u2019ve found that kind, funny, hard-working, passionate badasses dominate the industry.\n\nCannabis is an industry in flux: Recreational cannabis use in California only became legal on Jan. 1 \u2015 and just 10 months in, it\u2019s a total shitshow. New compliance regulations are released by the government all the time, and they often leave dispensaries and manufacturers scrambling to adhere to them or risk losing their licenses. Even with licenses intact, adjusting to the changes can leave businesses temporarily unable to serve their customers and patients.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, illegal dispensaries are still flourishing right out in the open while authorities use their time, energy and resources to make sure the licensed ones are following the new, and often very vague, rules to the T. The fact that cannabis is still federally illegal also makes thinks like banking tricky, which in turn causes daily annoyances and can lead to huge problems, like the inability to pay employees or vendors.\n\nCourtesy of Meg Hartley The author in front of a mural at the dispensary where she worked.\n\nCannabis is a gloriously complicated plant: The therapeutic effects of cannabis seemed magical to me when I started working in the industry, and oh, how I loved the glory of discovering exactly why. It turns out our bodies have something called endocannabinoid systems (ECS), which work with plant compounds called cannabinoids \u2015 THC and CBD are popular ones, but there are so many others. Each cannabinoid engages with the ECS, which then activates their distinct superpowers and thereby helps alleviate suffering from a huge range of ailments. Many cannabinoids are even capable of working their magic without getting the user stoned, a benefit for those who are seeking relief without looking to get high.\n\nThere\u2019s so much more to do with cannabis than just smoke it: I was in love with my vape pen \u2015 a device that uses a battery to warm cannabis oil in a cartridge and then produces a vapor the user inhales \u2015 when I started the job. But I had no idea how many other ways to partake in the plant there were out there. My favorite cannabis product is the tincture: I drop some THCa (a cannabinoid) oil under my tongue a few times a day, which helps my nerve pain like whoa. There are also topical solutions that are applied to the skin, edibles you eat or drink, capsules you take like a pill, patches to slap on your body for longer-term relief, even cannabis lube.\n\nCannabis isn\u2019t just for eating Funyuns and watching goofball movies (though it\u2019s great for that too!): Working in a dispensary taught me just how multifaceted cannabis really is. In addition to what it can offer those suffering from various ailments, different strains of cannabis and different cannabinoid profiles can also provide different users different experiences. If want to become one with your couch and enjoy satiating your munchies, there are strains for that. But there are also strains that are better for socializing, others for being productive, and some for using before or during sexual experiences. You can visit a dispensary and find exactly the strain you want or need for whatever activity you have planned. The notion that cannabis just makes you lazy only exists because people haven\u2019t learned exactly what cannabis is capable of or the myriad ways it can be used.\n\nCannabis is for everyone (of legal age, of course): Pop culture often portrays cannabis users as predominantly male 20-something slackers, but that\u2019s definitely not the case. The combination of decreasing stigma, increased studies on cannabis\u2019 benefits, and the availability of cannabinoids that don\u2019t get users high have all kinds of people interested in trying the plant. Grandmas, school teachers, rich people, poor people \u2015 we served them all at my dispensary. After a few weeks in my position, I was no longer shocked by the wide variety of people who came in to purchase cannabis. The only people who surprised me were the ones who weren\u2019t wearing any shoes, which happened three times in one week before we made a sign requiring footwear in the store.\n\nCannabis used to be sold in pharmacies all across America: I got to do a lot of fascinating research related to my position at the dispensary and cannabis prohibition was one of the most interesting topics I learned about. The plant used to be popular at U.S. pharmacies until 1937, when the Marijuana Tax Act was passed and the first major federal limitations on the sale and use of cannabis went into effect. Before then, it was legally sold in tincture form to treat many ailments. Then, after alcohol prohibition was overturned 1933, cannabis became the new target. A real peach of a man named Harry Anslinger led the charge, demonizing the plant and calling it \u201cmarihuana\u201d to make it sound like a different drug than the popular \u201ccannabis\u201d \u2015 and threateningly foreign to boot. He once reportedly said, \u201cReefer makes darkies think they\u2019re as good as white men.\u201d His horribly racist strategies were horribly effective, which greatly contributed to both the remaining stigma associated with cannabis and the current systemic mess we\u2019re attempting to clean up with legalization and regulation of the drug. This is why you shouldn\u2019t refer to the plant as \u201cmarijuana,\u201d a word with a racist history. Instead use its proper name, \u201ccannabis,\u201d or one of its many other colloquial names, like \u201cweed\u201d or \u201cherb.\u201d\n\n***\n\nI feel optimistic and excited about the future of the cannabis industry, despite its current messiness. Aside from legal issues, I believe a lack of education about the plant causes a lot of the troubles related to what cannabis can and can\u2019t \u2015 or should and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 do. I\u2019ve been a cannabis fan for much of my adult life and I\u2019ve lived in a state where it\u2019s been legal for recreational use since late 2015. Still, I was stunned by the massive amount I learned during my brief time working in the industry. If someone like me wasn\u2019t fully aware of the power or potential of this plant, I can only imagine what folks who have never tried it or researched it know \u2015 or don\u2019t know \u2015 about it.\n\nI\u2019m not alone in my passion for spreading accurate information about cannabis. Working to alleviate stigma and misinformation is also included on the manifestos of many cannabis companies. The industry is aware of the problem and is passionately working to find creative ways to address and bust the myths and straight-up lies about cannabis that continue to circulate. Hopefully our lawmakers and those tasked with enforcing the current laws will get on board and work with the industry to regulate cannabis and make it safe and available to everyone.\n\nCannabis is so much more than another way to relax with friends on a Friday night. I\u2019m grateful to have learned so much and to have met some really amazing people while working in the industry and I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll soon land another job that will allow me to continue to share the life-changing \u2015 and incredibly enjoyable \u2015 capabilities of this incredible plant.\n\nMeg Hartley has also written for Ravishly, Teen Vogue, MindBodyGreen, She Knows, and Tiny Buddha, among other outlets.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), is running in Orange County, traditionally a deep red bloc in a sea of blue. And she\u2019s doing it as an unabashed supporter of single-payer health care, expanded Social Security, tough banking rules and ensuring a debt-free college education.\n\nProgressives have long argued that populist economics have untapped political potential in supposedly red areas \u2015 though their theory usually focuses on struggling blue-collar regions.\n\nA win by Porter, who beat back more moderate rivals in a June primary, would test the appeal of these policies in a higher-earning district.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s 45th, where Porter is seeking to replace the two-term Rep. Mimi Walters (R), has a sizable population of affluent, college-educated voters. For example, over two-thirds of adults in the 280,000-person city of Irvine have a college degree, more than twice the rate of the country at large. The median household income there is nearly $94,000, compared with about $55,000 nationally.\n\nThe political character of the O.C.\u2019s sprawling suburbs have changed over the years as socially liberal voters abandoned the Republican Party and Asian-American families with more moderate political leanings began flowing in. (The county\u2019s Asian population went from 13.6 percent in 2000 to over 21 percent in 2016.)\n\nThe ascent of Donald Trump, whose bigoted views and vulgar demeanor turned off many Republican-leaning voters in the area, accelerated this process. He lost to Clinton in seven GOP-held House districts in 2016, including the 45th, where Clinton bested him by more than 5 percentage points.\n\n\u201cDemography is destiny,\u201d said Matthew Beckmann, a political scientist at UC Irvine and neighbor of Porter\u2019s. \u201cThe combination of a diverse, educated electorate with a sufficient number of moderate Republicans is what makes the 45th \u2018swing.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe anti-Trump vote is also an anti-corrupt-rich-guy vote. Jeff Hauser, Center for Economic and Policy Research\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Porter has tailored her message to the district with the discipline of a seasoned politician. She adopts centrist stances on some fiscal matters, emphasizes the national implications of her contest and hammers away at two-term Rep. Mimi Walters (R), whose conservative voting record is a liability with moderates.\n\nNonetheless, if Porter prevails, it would not only show that progressive economic policies are political winners in highly educated, upper-middle-class communities, it would be a significant feather in Warren\u2019s cap ahead of the 2020 presidential primary.\n\n\u201cThe anti-Trump vote is also an anti-corrupt-rich-guy vote, and the suburban Democratic women attracted to the Democratic Party are attracted to Elizabeth Warren\u2019s economic agenda, as well as the Democratic Party\u2019s greater tolerance on social issues,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research\u2019s Revolving Door Project, who previously worked as a strategist at the AFL-CIO.\n\nNone of it is particularly surprising to Porter though, who dismissed the assertion that hers is a \u201cwealthy\u201d district.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very middle-class district,\u201d she interjected during an interview with HuffPost at a campaign field office. Porter noted that the high cost of housing in the area and rising costs of education, health care and retirement were squeezing even families with higher degrees and decent-paying jobs. \u201cThere are a lot of pressures that families face here in order to provide for themselves.\u201d\n\nDigital First Media/Orange County Register/Getty Images Katie Porter campaigns alongside former Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan at the University of California, Irvine campus.\n\nThe Suburban Awakening\n\nKatie Kalvoda, a former wealth management executive from Laguna Hills, thinks of herself as the quintessential moderate \u2015 a \u201cpurple voter.\u201d She felt confident on Election Day in 2016 that Clinton would defeat Trump, so she voted for Walters, a Republican she admits she knew little about, to serve as a check on Clinton.\n\nWhen Trump won, Kalvoda, like so many other centrist suburbanites, was shocked. She immediately became involved in Women for American Values and Ethics, or WAVE \u2015 an Orange County incarnation of the myriad women-led Resistance groups that have popped up on Facebook pages across the country.\n\nKalvoda and several friends from WAVE then formed Asian Americans Rising to mobilize the Asian-American vote for Democrats. She recounted the tale of her transformation at an Oct. 9 panel discussion in Irvine sponsored by the new group. More than 40 people showed up to hear from Porter, Rep. Judy Chu of East Los Angeles County, and experts representing every Asian nationality present in the district.\n\nVoting for Walters is \u201cthe biggest regret of my life,\u201d Kalvoda told the attendees.\n\n\u201cEvery day of my life now I\u2019m paying for that sin,\u201d she added, prompting laughter.\n\nAcross the district, other voters shared similar stories \u2015 of voting Republican out of habit, only to wake up shocked to learn that the Grand Old Party was now the party of Trump, a man whose vulgar personality and xenophobia repelled them.\n\nDissatisfaction with Walters, as well as Trump, is a big part of why the latest public poll still shows Porter with a modest lead. That, and not Medicare for all, is the heart of Porter\u2019s pitch to voters.\n\n\u201cMy opponent Mimi Walters votes with Donald Trump 99 percent of the time,\u201d Porter began her brief remarks at the Asian Americans Rising event. \u201cAnd some of her votes ... are hurting families right here in Irvine and in Orange County, day in and day out.\u201d\n\nContinues anti-Walters riff by discussing how Walters celebrated ACA repeal. Walters \u201ctook a selfie\u201d in WH rose garden, while millions wondered about their health care, @katieporteroc pic.twitter.com/swsZqNh7jy \u2014 Daniel Marans (@danielmarans) October 9, 2018\n\nWalters, a former investment banker who now serves in House Republican leadership, has indeed done little to distinguish herself from the parts of Trump\u2019s agenda that are unpopular in Orange County. Unlike some California Republicans in vulnerable districts, including Dana Rohrabacher in the neighboring 48th, Walters voted for the Republican tax cut legislation. The law dramatically reduced the state and local tax deduction, or SALT, which the highly taxed, affluent residents of Orange County benefited from disproportionately.\n\nPorter\u2019s support for reinstating the deduction is a key part of her stump spiel \u2015 a way of showing that she, unlike Walters, would put her district before her party. It\u2019s also part of what won her the backing of both the California and National Associations of Realtors, trade groups spending serious cash to get Porter elected.\n\nMore controversially, it\u2019s given Porter grounds to buck the California Democratic Party on Proposition 6, a GOP-sponsored referendum repealing a 12-cent-a-gallon gas tax passed by the Democratic legislature and governor. Proponents of the tax, chief among them the state\u2019s building trades unions, consider it a key step toward modernizing the state\u2019s decaying roads and bridges.\n\nBut Porter, whose support for the repeal referendum cost her the endorsement of labor union LiUNA, says the loss of the SALT deduction has been punishing enough for her would-be constituents.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t support a gas tax on Orange County families at a time when Mimi Walters is going to raise their taxes,\u201d Porter told HuffPost. \u201cWe have to have infrastructure investment and I\u2019ll fight for it at the federal level.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, unlike some other vulnerable Republicans, Walters voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2015 and is now scrambling to claim, inaccurately, that she is a champion of protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nWalters, who was registered to vote in a different district as recently as June 2017, is not doing herself favors with constituent engagement either. Constituents complained to HuffPost about the absence of opportunities to speak with her.\n\nWalters has declined invitations to debate Porter or appear alongside her in any forum, according to Porter. Porter met her once, at a Memorial Day ceremony in the district this past May.\n\n\u201cI was really excited to meet her. She didn\u2019t share my enthusiasm,\u201d Porter deadpanned with a smirk.\n\nWalters\u2019 staff declined to speak with HuffPost during an in-person visit to her campaign headquarters or make Walters available for an interview. They also did not respond to multiple emails with detailed lists of questions about Walters\u2019 policy positions.\n\nBill Clark/Getty Images Rep. Mimi Walters (R-Calif.) leaves a House Republican Caucus meeting in May 2018.\n\nNot A Socialist \u2014 Not Even \u2018Progressive\u2019?\n\nPorter grew up the daughter of a farmer-turned-banker in a small Iowa town without stop signs, let alone traffic lights. When the farm crisis set in in the 1980s and there was a run on a local bank, Porter, then in middle school, remembers how quickly the bank reopened thanks to the help of the federal government, which restructured the bank\u2019s finances.\n\nFor families struggling with debts they incurred to sell crops that had plummeted in value, however, federal help was not forthcoming. Many families in Porter\u2019s community never really recovered, she told a crowd of about 100 voters who assembled to hear her and Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) discuss seniors\u2019 issues in Mission Viejo on the evening of Oct. 9.\n\n\u201cWashington works for those who pay for it \u2015 for those who write the big checks, for the special interests,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t work very well for all of us.\u201d\n\nPorter went on to earn her college degree at Yale and a law degree at Harvard, where then-professor Elizabeth Warren, a bankruptcy law expert, would become a mentor. Porter collaborated with Warren in studying the role of high health care costs in household bankruptcies in the United States.\n\nA September 2017 fundraising email for Porter that Warren sent her supporters features a photo of Warren and Porter at Porter\u2019s graduation in 2001.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen Katie\u2019s commitment and grit up close and personal,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her determination to tell the story of a rigged game. And I\u2019ve seen her put it all on the line to fight for what she believes in.\u201d\n\nKatie and I spent years studying how working families go broke after a medical emergency. I know we can count on @katieporteroc to fight for health care & working families. https://t.co/w4Tr7XFkJz \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) September 13, 2018\n\nAfter a period in private practice, Porter embarked on a career in academia. Her expertise on bankruptcy and consumer law has taken her as far as Myanmar, where she advised the government on setting up its own consumer protection infrastructure.\n\nIn 2012, Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who was then California\u2019s attorney general, tapped Porter to oversee the state\u2019s distribution of its share of a $25 billion national settlement with big banks for fraudulent foreclosures. She was tasked with monitoring the banks to make sure they followed through on their commitments, as well as connecting homeowners to the resources they were owed.\n\nHarris told HuffPost that Porter combined an incredibly detailed grasp for policy with a visceral appreciation of how those details affected ordinary people.\n\n\u201cShe really understands the bigger picture and what\u2019s at stake,\u201d Harris said.\n\nWhen Porter decided to run for Congress, she won the near-immediate support of Sens. Warren and Harris. She also became the first congressional candidate this election cycle to be endorsed by EMILY\u2019s List, a group that backs pro-abortion rights Democratic women.\n\nThe June primary race turned nasty in California\u2019s 45th. Porter\u2019s closest rival was fellow UC Irvine law professor Dave Min, whom Porter helped recruit to the school. He ran on a more moderate platform, which notably did not include Medicare for all.\n\nIn the course of a contentious fight for the endorsement of the California Democratic Party in February, some of Min\u2019s allies allegedly spread rumors that the circumstances of Porter\u2019s divorce and restraining order she had secured against her ex-husband were politically disqualifying.\n\nPorter opened up to HuffPost about the whisper campaign in May. Porter had called the police on her then-husband in 2013 when he grew physically violent toward her and their then-infant child. They are now divorced and he lives in Oregon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to let someone, anyone, say that because a woman\u2019s been a victim of domestic violence, because she stood up for her children\u2019s safety, she\u2019s disqualified,\u201d she said at the time.\n\nMin\u2019s campaign vehemently denied in May that he had any involvement in the rumors, noting that his wife is a \u201cnationally recognized\u201d domestic violence expert.\n\nPorter has since reconciled with Min, who introduced the panel at the Asian Americans Rising event.\n\nI\u2019m gonna be skeptical of any tax increase. Katie Porter\n\nPorter\u2019s support for Medicare for all undoubtedly helped her in the primary, but it has also had some benefits in the general election. It\u2019s earned her the endorsements and modest financial backing of the pro-single payer National Nurses United and Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal\u2019s (D) Medicare for All PAC.\n\nVirginia Tibbetts, a retired teacher from Tustin, was a diehard \u201cBernie or bust\u201d partisan in 2016, refusing to vote for Clinton in the general election and formally deregistering from the Democratic Party in protest over how the Democratic National Committee treated Sanders during the primary. She\u2019s not even a fan of Warren, claiming the Massachusetts senator did not do enough to oppose the Dakota Access pipeline.\n\nBut Tibbetts had no reservations about supporting Porter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fired up mostly because of our health care and that\u2019s a big issue for her \u2015 Medicare for all,\u201d said Tibbetts, who sported a Porter pin at the Nuns on the Bus event in Irvine.\n\nAt the same time, Republican groups have seized on Porter\u2019s stance on the issue to argue that she would raise middle-class taxes to finance a $32 trillion government takeover of health care. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), has spent over $4 million in the race. A television ad the group aired in September featured an Irvine woman lamenting Porter\u2019s support for single-payer.\n\nA July study by the libertarian Mercatus Center indeed found that adopting a Medicare for all system would cost $32 trillion over a 10-year period. But it also found that the program, while formally shifting health care costs onto the government\u2019s books, would save the country $2 trillion overall, ensuring that consumers come out on top.\n\nEconomists debate exactly how much of the cost of implementing Medicare for all would ultimately have to come through new taxes, and how much of it could be achieved through even greater savings on the cost of the underlying care. Even if it\u2019s a net financial gain for the average American, financing Medicare for all would almost certainly require some form of higher taxation to get off the ground in the near term.\n\nPorter prefers to emphasize the cost control part of the equation, arguing that empowering Medicare to negotiate lower prices on prescription drugs and taking on powerful middlemen like pharmacy benefit managers would get the country most of the way there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna be skeptical of any tax increase,\u201d she told HuffPost.\n\nAt times, Porter\u2019s efforts to avoid being pegged as a liberal firebrand can seem contrived. If elected, she plans to join the Medicare for All Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nBut when asked whether she identifies as a \u201cprogressive,\u201d Porter is noncommittal.\n\n\u201cI am going to push to advance issues that will help America make progress,\u201d she said. \u201cI define those to include tackling climate change, working to create more clean energy jobs, pushing for a health care system that is affordable and effective.\u201d\n\nOne of the reasons that Porter\u2019s association with Warren hasn\u2019t proven more politically harmful in the district is that Warren, unlike Trump or House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, has a net-positive approval rating in the district, according to a Democratic strategist familiar with the data.\n\nIt can\u2019t hurt that unlike Bernie Sanders, who identifies as a \u201cdemocratic socialist,\u201d Warren proudly calls herself a \u201ccapitalist.\u201d\n\nSo does Porter, who encouraged HuffPost to ask her about it.\n\n\u201cI have spent my entire career fighting for a system of capitalism that gives every American a fair shake in our economy,\u201d she declared. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ll do in Congress.\u201d", "Two students have been suspended after showing up at their Kentucky school on Halloween dressed as the teenage Columbine shooters.\n\nThe freshman girls, who weren\u2019t identified by education officials, arrived at Adair County High School Wednesday in costumes similar to the clothing worn by students Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, reported ABC affiliate WHAS-TV in Columbia.\n\nKlebold and Harris killed 12 students and a teacher at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999 before turning their guns on themselves.\n\nNo one initially guessed who the girls were supposed to be were until they told friends, \u201cWe\u2019re the school shooters,\u201d USA Today reported.\n\n\u201cThey pretty much had on all black with fake blood on their faces,\u201d a senior at the school told the newspaper. \u201cAt the time, it wasn\u2019t really scary because they didn\u2019t have weapons or anything, but the whole thing was really weird.\u201d\n\nThe girls appeared on social media in their costumes re-enacting poses of the shooters, including after the young gunmen\u2019s suicides.

She can be brassy or naive but never unknowable. Roberts, arguably the defining movie star of the past 30 years, has had precious few opportunities to disappear into someone we might call an enigma. You don\u2019t have to figure out a Julia Roberts character because the script has always done it for you.\n\nAnd then along came \u201cHomecoming.\u201d\n\nEasily the best thing Roberts has touched since \u201cErin Brockovich\u201d 18 years ago, the first season of Amazon Prime\u2019s silvery psychothriller revamps the actress\u2019 armory within its first five minutes.\n\nRoberts plays Heidi Bergman, a social worker employed at a Florida facility that houses freshly discharged members of the military easing into civilian life with professional aid. In the inaugural scene, Heidi greets her newest client (rising star Stephan James, soon to appear in \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk\u201d), flashing a Roberts-certified grin during their warm introduction. She moves through her beige, fish-tanked office with tranquility and an optimism about the progress that awaits them. So far, so Julia.\n\nThe scene is brief, terminating the session before it has even begun. A Disney-ready symphonic score swells, the camera panning out the window behind Heidi\u2019s desk. And then, with a thunderclap, everything shifts. The frame\u2019s dimensions shrink, blackening the edges so the action occupies only half the screen, as if to announce something is awry. But what? There, again, is Heidi, in a condensed aspect ratio, looking slightly older and waiting tables at an even beiger seafood restaurant on a pier. Four years have lapsed. She\u2019s the same person we just saw smiling at her admirable office job \u2015 and yet she\u2019s not.\n\nShe\u2019s Julia Roberts \u2015 and yet, magnificently, she is very much not.\n\nAmazon Studios Roberts and Stephan James in \"Homecoming.\"\n\nAcross 10 snug and addictive half-hour episodes, Roberts sinks further into her not-Julia-Roberts-ness. For someone whose fame and charm has long preceded the characters she portrays, \u201cHomecoming\u201d is a revelation. In widescreen, she is cautious but bright-eyed; scrunched to half that scope, she is weathered and confined. Something or someone has robbed her spirit.\n\nPart of the ingenuity stems from the show\u2019s time-hopping structure: When the screen narrows, we are thrust into a future in which Heidi cannot recall key events from her tenure at the titular rehabilitation program. That design lets Roberts crisscross two divergent mindsets in each episode, and it lets us play detective alongside her. When a Department of Defense investigator (Shea Whigham) starts probing Heidi about her past, it falls on her shoulders \u2015 and ours \u2015 to figure out what really happened to the veterans she thought she was helping. Instead of steering the story, as Roberts does even when she gets second billing on a project, she is the audience\u2019s proxy, equally bewildered by the shadowy turns of events.\n\nThe less you know before watching \u201cHomecoming,\u201d the better. Adapted from Eli Horowitz and Micah Bloomberg\u2019s fiction podcast of the same name, the series is directed by \u201cMr. Robot\u201d maestro Sam Esmail, who streamlines his hyperstylish kinetics into something crisper and more decisive. He took a swing in casting Roberts not because she doesn\u2019t seem capable but because Heidi is by definition a role that would go to Laura Dern or Regina King \u2015 someone celebrated for the exact complexities that \u201cHomecoming\u201d requires.\n\nRoberts\u2019 performance works in spades because the show, similarly, won\u2019t settle for being just one thing. It\u2019s far too Hitchcockian for that, the sort of conspiracy caper that Robert Redford would have made in the \u201970s. Without needing a single combat sequence, it\u2019s a political cryptogram about PTSD and wartime horrors. But it\u2019s also a chilling portrait of corporate American greed, as the company running the Homecoming initiative \u2015 led by a desperate bully (Bobby Cannavale) who barks orders at Heidi from his Bluetooth headset \u2015 is best known for manufacturing household products, not refurbishing soldiers. And most significantly, it\u2019s a character study about a woman who has been used and manipulated and the ways she processes the accompanying memories so they redefine her reality.\n\nAmazon Studios Hong Chau and Bobby Cannavale in \"Homecoming.\"\n\nIn September, when I talked to Roberts at the Toronto International Film Festival, where the first four episodes of \u201cHomecoming\u201d premiered, she insisted she doesn\u2019t see this as a new chapter in her career. Nor is it a comeback \u2014 as many will claim \u2014 considering that \u201cWonder,\u201d \u201cMoney Monster,\u201d \u201cMother\u2019s Day,\u201d \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d and \u201cSecret in Their Eyes\u201d came out in the past four years.\n\n\u201cI asked for an \u2018introducing\u2019 credit on this, and Sam wouldn\u2019t give it to me,\u201d she joked.\n\nBut next month Roberts will headline the mother-son addiction drama \u201cBen Is Back\u201d alongside Lucas Hedges, and neither it nor \u201cHomecoming\u201d feels like an obvious choice for the Oscar winner, who has been treated by Hollywood as more a brand than a talent. She has inched in this new direction before, but it has never quite clicked as it does here, largely because she\u2019s never been gifted with material as rich as \u201cHomecoming.\u201d As for what it all means, 31 years into her career, she plays coy. \u201cI don\u2019t know. This is for other people to puzzle out,\u201d she said. \u201cI just put on the cute outfits and show up.\u201d\n\nWhether or not she\u2019s introspective about what these new projects will do for her reputation, Roberts is having a deserved moment \u2015 the kind she hasn\u2019t experienced since at least the early 2010s, when her renown helped her rise above disappointing adaptations of \u201cEat Pray Love\u201d and \u201cAugust: Osage County.\u201d The second half of \u201cHomecoming,\u201d which begs to be binged in one sitting (look out for a critical post-credit scene in the finale), reveals what an expressive actress Roberts is when playing forlorn. The mystery\u2019s threads intertwine, and suddenly Heidi must reckon with her actions, as well as those of her overlords, all while a bureaucrat (and her mother, aka Sissy Spacek) demands answers. It evokes \u201cErin Brockovich\u201d and \u201cThe Pelican Brief\u201d but with a far more restrained palette.", "People sometimes moan about how \u201cthey don\u2019t make movies like they used to.\u201d\n\nSo, on Friday, hundreds of Twitter users lightheartedly reimagined their favorite \u201980s film titles for 2018. Many folks inevitably used the globally trending #UpdateAn80sFilm hashtag to poke fun at President Donald Trump.", "Caitlin O'Hara for HuffPost Ephraim Infante, an organizer with NextGen, holds a month-old Vietnamese pot-bellied pig at the Votes and Goats event at Arizona State University in Glendale on Oct. 23.\n\nGLENDALE, Ariz. \u2015 Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund manager who has become one of the Democratic Party\u2019s biggest individual donors in recent years, has spent $33 million this election cycle trying to increase young voter turnout. Most of the money has gone to hire 750 NextGen America organizers, spread across 11 states and 419 college campuses. Another huge chunk \u2015 more than $10 million \u2015 has gone to digital advertising targeted at people aged 18 to 35.\n\nBut one day last month, on the Arizona State University campus in Glendale, a small portion of Steyer\u2019s fortune went to pay for the rental of an alpaca named Spot, a piglet named Jack Skellington, six goats, a sheep and a group of baby chicks so small they had to remain in a bucket.\n\nStudents crowded around the animals, taking selfies. Their stop at the makeshift petting zoo gave NextGen organizers and volunteers time to approach them, hand them a voter guide and help them make a plan to vote. By the end of the Votes and Goats event, more than 75 students had filled out a mail-in ballot.\n\n\u201cAnimals are a really cool attraction,\u201d said Ephraim Infante, a recent Arizona State graduate and NextGen organizer. \u201cBeing able to put a voter guide in their hand goes a long way. In the past, young people haven\u2019t really been talked to. This is our chance to talk to them.\u201d\n\nArizona State isn\u2019t the only place where NextGen is deploying petting zoos, and petting zoos aren\u2019t their only tactic. They\u2019re also passing out toilet paper to students who live off-campus, and bringing \u201cpuppies to the polls,\u201d and basically any other Instagram-able stunt you can think of.\n\n\u201cWe think the best thing that works is voter-to-voter conversation, peer to peer,\u201d Steyer would explain later. \u201cBut the other thing we\u2019ve found that works is that human beings love animals. People love puppies. If that\u2019s what it takes to get people to vote, we\u2019re shameless.\u201d\n\nSteyer\u2019s combination of shamelessness and money might be what it takes to solve one of the Democratic Party\u2019s biggest problems: How do you turn out the young people who show up in presidential years but regularly skip the midterm elections, when a majority of the nation\u2019s gubernatorial races are decided and when control of Congress regularly changes hands?\n\nCaitlin O'Hara for HuffPost Students interact with farm animals at the Votes and Goats petting zoo and get-out-the-vote event.\n\nThe fact that Steyer \u2015 who will likely run for president himself in 2020 \u2015 took up this assignment, if you want to call it that, points to his strange standing in the party. While he has been one of the party\u2019s largest donors, he\u2019s somewhat estranged from the Democratic establishment. Even before he began feuding with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and others over his push to impeach President Donald Trump, many Democratic operatives viewed him as something of a dilettante.\n\nAnd his decision to build his own group, NextGen, contrasts with the approach of the other Democratic billionaire who might run for president, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has mostly directed his money toward major Democratic super PACs to spend on traditional television advertising. Asked about the differences between them, Steyer shrugged and said he didn\u2019t want to criticize Bloomberg. Then he quickly added, \u201cWe\u2019ve never supported a Republican\u201d \u2015 a reference to Bloomberg\u2019s bipartisan tendencies.\n\nSince Trump\u2019s election, Steyer has been consistent in drawing a clear distinction between the two parties. His goal, simply, is to bring out more Democratic voters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only focused on growing the electorate,\u201d said Ben Wessel, director of the youth vote at NextGen. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to worry about what a Republican-leaning ironworker named Bob thinks.\u201d\n\nNextGen, which is using college-age organizers to rally their peers to the polls, looks to be the biggest and best-funded effort to turn out young people in a midterm election ever. The group operates in Arizona, California, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. It could make or break key Senate, House and governor\u2019s races.\n\nWhile nearly half of eligible voters 18 to 29 tend to cast a ballot in presidential years, that number typically plummets to between 20 percent and 30 percent during a midterm election. The last midterms, where Democrats fell before a second consecutive Republican wave, saw the lowest turnout from voters 18 to 29 in decades, according to U.S. Census data.\n\nThere\u2019s some evidence that\u2019s changing in 2018: While polling indicates young voters aren\u2019t going to turn out at the high rates of the senior citizen crowd, they do seem more excited to vote than in any recent midterm election. A poll from CIRCLE, a center at Tufts University that studies youth voting trends, found 34 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds said they were \u201cextremely likely\u201d to vote this year, which is getting closer to the 40 percent who said they were \u201cextremely like\u201d to cast a ballot in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. \u201cWe\u2019re really seeing positive signs and signals, especially for a midterm election,\u201d said Abby Kiesa, director of impact at CIRCLE.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Tom Steyer, co-founder of NextGen, is considering a run for president himself in 2020.\n\nAnother chunk of evidence suggesting higher youth turnout comes from early voting: In Texas and Nevada, youth turnout is up 500 percent from the 2014 midterms, according to an analysis by the Democratic data firm TargetSmart. In Georgia, it\u2019s up 400 percent. Arizona has seen a 300 percent spike.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to attribute all of this to NextGen. After all, they\u2019re not even operating in Texas and Georgia. But the 2017 gubernatorial races point to the group\u2019s potential impact. In Virginia, where NextGen ran extensive operations, youth turnout spiked to 34 percent, according to an analysis from CIRCLE. In the more sleepy New Jersey gubernatorial contest, it stayed steady at 18 percent.\n\nSteyer, chatting over a Cobb salad and an Arnold Palmer at a hotel in Washington, explained why he decided to dedicate millions to the cause of convincing young people to actually vote, when historical evidence shows them stubbornly resistant to showing up at the polls.\n\n\u201cIt can make a gigantic difference,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd also, no one\u2019s doing it. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s gigantic competition to do this job,\u201d he added.\n\nOn specific campuses, NextGen can point to some success as well. In Iowa, their organizers registered one-fifth of the student body at Grinnell College. About one-third of the student body showed up to vote on the first day of early voting. At Bennett College, a small, all-women\u2019s historically black institution in Greensboro, North Carolina, organizers registered about one-third of the student body and have been leading 50-person marches to the polls.\n\n\ud83d\udea8#YouthVote Video of the Day\ud83d\udea8\n\nCheck out these @BennettCollege Belles, marching to early vote (with @iAspire4More!) to cast their ballots in targeted #NC13. @NextGenAmerica knows we gotta #TrustBlackWomen and has registered >30% of the Bennett student body to vote! pic.twitter.com/13giPngOlR \u2014 Ben \"Election Day is 11/6\" Wessel (@BenWessel) October 26, 2018\n\nNextGen has made sure to focus on historically black colleges and community colleges, two groups they think were typically ignored as traditional efforts to turn out student voters often came down to encouraging the College Democrats chapter at big universities to hand out fliers on the quad.\n\nSteyer, Wessel and other NextGen organizers can display a bit of dismissiveness toward those traditional efforts to get young people to the polls. Nonpartisan campaigns aiming to guilt students into voting don\u2019t work. \u201cVoting as a civic duty is a total garbage argument,\u201d Wessel said. The giant, celebrity-laden concert tours? \u201cWe\u2019ve tried everything,\u201d Steyer responded. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried concerts. They don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nInstead, NextGen focuses on having young people talk to young people about what can happen if they do vote. The voter guide that organizers passed out in Arizona reminds students that the Democratic Senate candidate here, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, \u201cwill stand up to Trump\u201d while her GOP opponent, Rep. Martha McSally, will not. It says the same for Democrat David Garcia, the gubernatorial candidate running an uphill race against Republican incumbent Doug Ducey.", "Somebody buy Tiffany Trump a diary!\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s only daughter with his second wife, Marla Maples, wished her older half-sister, Ivanka Trump, a happy birthday on Friday.\n\nBut the Instagram message to her \u201cbest friend\u201d was three days late.\n\nIt\u2019s not known whether Tiffany Trump sent a private message to her sibling on her actual special day, but she blamed her delayed salutation via social media on \u201claw school life.\u201d The 25-year-old is currently a student at Georgetown Law.\n\nIvanka Trump, a senior adviser in her father\u2019s administration, turned 37 on Tuesday.", "After years of reports about corrupt state officials defrauding the government, South Dakota\u2019s Republican lawmakers in 2017 called an emergency session of the Legislature. The goal? To squash a referendum the state\u2019s voters had passed just months earlier to impose stringent new ethics and campaign finance rules.\n\nNow, the Democrat who led the fight against the Republicans\u2019 brazen move is using an anti-corruption message to mount a surprisingly competitive campaign to become the state\u2019s next governor.\n\nBillie Sutton, a 34-year-old rancher, former rodeo competitor and state senator, is promising his first order of business as governor will be to make South Dakota\u2019s government more transparent and reform its campaign finance laws. It\u2019s a nonpartisan policy, embraced by Democratic, Republican and independent voters across the state, and it could help push Sutton over the top in a state that leans heavily Republican.\n\n\u201cPeople have lost trust in their state government,\u201d Sutton, the leader of the Democratic Party in the state Senate, told HuffPost. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing movement of frustration that the voters aren\u2019t being listened to.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS South Dakota state Sen. Billie Sutton is running a surprisingly strong campaign as the Democratic candidate for governor.\n\nSutton\u2019s stunningly successful bid comes as national Democrats have struggled to make President Donald Trump\u2019s corruption a central issue in the battle for Congress. But it could provide a template for how good-government Democrats can succeed even in the reddest places on the political map.\n\nSouth Dakota hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat as governor in Sutton\u2019s entire lifetime, and President Donald Trump won the state by 30 points in 2016. But it wasn\u2019t long ago that the state was represented by three Democrats in Congress \u2015 two in the Senate and one in the House. Those elected Democrats were slowly wiped out from 2004 to 2014 as the state followed the national trend of increased regional partisan polarization. They were replaced by the state\u2019s current senators \u2015 John Thune and Mike Rounds \u2015 and Rep. Kristi Noem, who is the Republican nominee for governor in 2018.\n\nThe race between Sutton and Noem to replace outgoing Gov. Dennis Daugaard (R) is currently very close. The most recent poll in the race, released on Thursday, put Noem up three points over Sutton while the previous poll had the race tied.\n\nSutton is looking to reverse the party\u2019s longtime slide in his home state by focusing on issues like corruption, economic development, education and health care that have support from voters of all political stripes. He emphasizes his bipartisan credentials as a lawmaker who has won election in a Republican district and worked with Republicans to balance budgets and cut taxes in the Legislature. He also has mostly avoided controversies over the policies that normally doom Democrats in South Dakota, as he backs gun rights and is opposed to abortion. That may cost him national attention and party support, but that\u2019s perfectly fine with him.\n\n\u201cOur focus isn\u2019t on what the national party has done right or done wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nIt also helps that he\u2019s a young politician who has stayed in South Dakota while his opponent is a congresswoman who has spent the last seven years casting votes in Congress \u2015 a body that is not popular in any state. He has hammered Noem as an ambitious Washington insider who is running a campaign with money that she transferred from her federal campaign account. This was a practice that was banned in the referendum passed by voters in 2016 and reversed by the Republican Legislature almost immediately after.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just been climbing the ladder, one elected office at a time,\u201d Sutton said.\n\nSutton\u2019s ads also highlight his cowboy image and small-town personality. He\u2019s almost always wearing a cowboy hat and is often shot on horseback, talking to his constituents at a diner or sitting in front of Main Street in his hometown of Burke. What also comes across in his ads is that Sutton is paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nWhile his grandfather served in the Legislature from 1972 to 1978 before running unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor, Sutton was not interested in a political life. His real love was rodeo. He competed in rodeos in high school and then in college while studying for a degree in business finance. Just as he was working toward graduation, a horse flipped over on him at a competition in Minot, North Dakota. He woke up paralyzed from a shattered vertebrae and learned that he would never walk again.\n\nHe says he never would have gotten through the devastation of his injury if it weren\u2019t for his family, friends and faith, and his future wife, Kelsea, whom he had only been dating for two weeks when the accident happened. The support he received from his community gave him a new purpose and a desire to give back.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of support, and it kind of awakened in me a service-over-self mentality just because of the people that invest in me,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cI wanted to give back. And the Legislature is the perfect example of that.\u201d\n\nSutton\u2019s personal story, his still-local roots and his bipartisan credentials in the Legislature help explain part of his success so far. But his anti-corruption focus is what really stands out. In calling for ethics, transparency and campaign finance reforms, he\u2019s found a nonpartisan way to set himself apart from the one-party government that has ruled the state\u2019s politics for decades. As the Argus Leader, the local paper of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, said in its endorsement of Sutton, \u201cIn some ways, this permanence of one-party rule has hindered progress.\u201d\n\nThe problems resulting from the Republican Party\u2019s one-party rule are seen in the scandals it has produced. In one scandal, a cabinet official who ran the state\u2019s EB-5 visa distribution was accused of diverting hundreds of thousands of dollars to a company that he then went to work for. EB-5 visas provide lawful permanent residency to immigrants investing $500,000 or more in the economy and have been a source of scandal in other states as well. The Gear Up scandal involved state officials and contractors stealing money from a program meant to inform low-income high school students about colleges and universities. Both scandals revealed a glaring lack of transparency in the government\u2019s operations and helped fuel campaigns to enact ethics reforms.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve traveled the state, that\u2019s been the No. 1 issue that I\u2019ve heard about is a lack of accountability \u2015 a lack of transparency \u2015 that people are just very frustrated because it\u2019s costing the taxpayers with wasted, fraudulent expenditures, and that\u2019s not allowing us to prioritize where we need to prioritize their dollars,\u201d Sutton said.\n\nThese issues are clearly on voters\u2019 mind. On Tuesday, they\u2019ll get another shot at approving a ballot measure similar to the one Republicans torpedoed last year. Sutton has promised he will promote and protect the amendment while pushing for additional transparency and campaign finance reforms.", "Damon Dahlen/HuffPost Greg Cruey, a teacher at Southside K-8 school, greeting students in the morning. This photo has been edited to protect the identities of the subjects.\n\nWAR, W.Va. \u2015 Middle school teacher Greg Cruey can explain the most harrowing details of his students\u2019 lives with matter-of-fact precision.\n\nThat smart sixth-grader who had her hand raised last period? She\u2019s homeless and has, in the past, been suicidal. That middle school student who seemed on edge during class? As a young child, his parents used him to make pornography; they needed the money for their drug addictions. That sassy eighth-grader with the long hair? Her mom just got out of jail and seems to be allowing her to smoke pot in the house.\n\nMany of these details are ones that, after 15 years in the classroom, Cruey has learned to pick up on, through careful tracking: what students are wearing, hunger levels and emotional states. But sometimes students will offer up these deeply personal details after class with shrugs, as if it\u2019s information as casual as what they ate for lunch. When Cruey still has questions, he will glean information through listening to the constant murmur of student gossip in hallways, tracking social media posts and keeping his ear to the ground at church.\n\nIt\u2019s Cruey\u2019s job to keep track of these particulars, even more than lesson planning or standardized test preparation.\n\n\u201cMy job as a teacher is to be a first responder to poverty,\u201d said Cruey, a 58-year-old middle school social studies teacher at Southside K-8 school. \u201cIf my students learn other stuff, too, that\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nCruey\u2019s school, in War, West Virginia, in McDowell County, has long been held up as a living example of how poverty can limit educational attainment. So when the opioid crisis hit, it hit McDowell County particularly hard. In 2014, the county led the state in opioid-related hospitalizations. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ranked McDowell County as second-most at-risk in the country for an HIV outbreak due to intravenous drug use.\n\nIt\u2019s why, over the course of Cruey\u2019s years in the classroom, he has become used to stories of families torn apart over drugs, as parents and guardians shuffle between hospitals and jails. He cites estimates that nearly half of students live with someone other than their parents. Others are being raised by grandparents, relatives, friends and foster parents.\n\nIn War, atypical family structures are the norm.\n\nNelson Spencer, who retired last month as superintendent of McDowell schools, said that in some of the county\u2019s schools, as many as 40 percent of students don\u2019t live with their parents. And though many of these arrangements are informal, with students casually bouncing between the homes of family members and friends, West Virginia has seen a spike in foster care entrances compared with the U.S. average. In 2016, there were 1,221 foster care entrances per 100,000 youth, compared with the U.S. average of 369.\n\nData analysis by The Hechinger Report\n\nIt\u2019s a pattern that teachers and school administrators are seeing emerge in many communities, as some states have seen drastic spikes in the number of foster care entrances in recent years. Around the country, the number of kids in foster care increased by about 10 percent from 2012 to 2016. At the same time, the number of children being removed from their homes because of parental drug use has also increased, according to data from the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System.\n\nAnd in many places, teachers like Cruey are on the front line of this crisis, working to counteract the effects this trauma has on students\u2019 lives.\n\nFor this story, HuffPost/Hechinger Report spent several days shadowing Cruey at his school at the end of the last school year. The time spent showed that teachers, just as much as medical professionals and addiction counselors, serve as first responders to the opioid crisis. Cruey\u2019s story is unique \u2015 in a particular area where rates of addiction and poverty are high \u2015 but it\u2019s also representative of what teachers are experiencing in many communities.\n\nOnly 58 percent of children involved in the foster care system finish high school by 19, compared with 87 percent of the general population. Helping deeply traumatized students to succeed in school can be a tough battle.\n\nDamon Dahlen/HuffPost The decline of coal production started a downward spiral in War, West Virginia.\n\nA Cycle Of Crisis\n\nWar was once a center for coal production \u2015 a town where \u201ceverybody worked\u201d \u2015 but it spiraled downward as the industry declined.. By 1990, the population in McDowell had fallen to about 35,000 people after a high of nearly 100,000 in 1950.\n\nFor schools in the area, this means frequent visits from the Department of Child Protective Services and an abnormally small number of students who live with mom and dad, Cruey said. It also means having students at the center of a crisis that they did nothing to help create. It means high rates of students in special education \u2015 about 40 percent of middle school students have individualized education plans \u2015 a phenomenon Cruey attributes, in part, to the high rates of pregnant mothers on drugs.\n\nOn the outside, Southside K-8 school is almost idyllic. Plush mountains surround the recently renovated building, there\u2019s a new jungle gym where young kids swing around and an impressive green football field sits nearby.\n\nBut upon closer inspection, the subtle contours of the opioid crisis are undeniably present.\n\nThe football field, once a source of community pride, previously served as a place where student-athletes and local coaches could ascend to the status of community legends. It\u2019s where Homer Hickam, famed NASA engineer portrayed in the movie \u201cOctober Sky,\u201d tried his hand at sports before moving on to rocket science. It was previously attached to Big Creek High School.\n\nBut in 2010, the school was closed down over a decline in student enrollment. In 2015, the abandoned school was burned down in an act of arson.\n\nSouthside K-8 students now use the field for their football team, but most of the time they can barely get enough students to fill the roster.\n\nDamon Dahlen/HuffPost Teacher Greg Cruey keeps track mentally of where all his students are living and in what circumstances.\n\nCruey, a gregarious man with warm eyes and a friendly smile, attributes the team\u2019s lack of stability to his students\u2019 transience and an overall drain in population. Families are constantly shuffling in and out of the area in hopes of finding a coveted job in the coal mines. And as students with drug-using parents bounce between staying with grandparents, great-grandparents, foster parents and neighbors, Cruey never knows when a student will suddenly stop showing up or will come back after months away.\n\nAs a teacher, that means Cruey has to learn to roll with the punches, even though those punches so rarely involve the stuff he was trained to do, like devise lessons, assign homework and monitor learning progress. Cruey maintains a constant mental tracker of which students are living where, which students recently left, and which students are on their way out. He has directly called Child Protective Services at times.\n\nOn his way to school in the morning \u2015 he lives about a 30-minute drive away in Virginia \u2015 he watches for parents hitchhiking on the side of the road. He keeps track of which boys are dating which girls \u2015 lamenting that he often sees kids sexually active at young ages, without an understanding of the consequences. Several years ago the school had a pregnant fifth-grader \u2015 she ended up getting an abortion.\n\nIt\u2019s inevitable that sometimes these traumas make their way into the classroom.\n\nDamon Dahlen/HuffPost Lessons in the classroom sometimes have to be customized for kids who face myriad crises in young their lives.\n\nDuring a second period class on a Thursday morning last May, Cruey taught a lesson on Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the politics of the New Deal. The class was mostly engaged, aside from a boy laying his head on a desk, attempting to sleep. Cruey let him. It\u2019s not something an educator would typically allow \u2015 especially one like Cruey, who closely monitors and stomps out classroom misbehavior. But this time Cruey let it slide. He knew enough to know the boy needed the rest.\n\n\u201cHe was taken by Child Protective Services two weeks ago, and we didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever see him again, and he came back,\u201d said Cruey of the boy after class. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those situations where \u2015 CPS will show up here because this is the one spot where they don\u2019t have to confront the parents to get the kid. They know our address.\u201d\n\nAfter school and on weekends, too, the work continues. Cruey\u2019s wife, Cheryl, who was principal of Southside K-8 until retiring at the end of the 2017-2018 school year, mentors three siblings in the district. Cruey\u2019s involved, too. He and Cheryl started helping out after the family of seven spent a winter together in a home where the only adequate heat was a fireplace.\n\nAbout twice a month, Cruey and his wife take the kids shopping, to church and out for pizza. They bring them bags of food and check on them throughout the school day.\n\nDamon Dahlen/HuffPost Greg Cruey and his wife, Cheryl, a former principal, often work together to help kids in need.\n\nBut sometimes mentoring is not enough. Sometimes the pain of a child is so great that Cruey feels compelled to do more. Several years ago, Cruey \u2015 who has grown children from a previous marriage \u2015 was in discussions to adopt one of the school\u2019s students, who was in fifth grade at the time.\n\nThe student was one of six children, born to a single mother with an addiction to drugs. The eldest sibling, who is now in her 20s and whom Cruey\u2019s wife had had as a student, was in prison at the time. The second eldest was on drugs. The three youngest ended up getting adopted by a local family, leaving a middle boy to mostly fend for himself.\n\nDiscussions about an adoption were moving smoothly along until the boy\u2019s legal stepfather was killed, and the boy was granted survivor\u2019s benefits, Cruey said. Suddenly mom wanted to be involved again, and the adoption process was halted.\n\nSix months later, Child Protective Services took the child away and sent him to live with relatives in a different part of the state.\n\n\u201cOccasionally we see him on Facebook. He\u2019s maybe in the ninth grade now. As far as I can tell, he\u2019s doing OK from this distance. His life has changed radically just from not being here,\u201d Cruey said.\n\nPride And Pain\n\n\n\nAmid these issues, there are stories of hope, joy and pride. The district has worked hard to improve its academic outcomes, and there certainly have been improvements. Overall, there\u2019s been an increase in graduation rates and a decrease in dropouts. Spencer, the former superintendent, also points to a decline in teen pregnancies.\n\n\n\n\u201cI see a growth in our students. They are proud of where they come from. They\u2019re proud of their heritage. They look people in the eye when they speak,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cIf given the right opportunity, our kids can compete with anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut Cruey isn\u2019t sure that many of his students have the luxury of dreaming about the long term.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor many of them, the horizon is much closer than \u2018When I grow up.\u2019 They think in terms of the instability of their life circumstances and who they\u2019ll live with next year, whether they can get a better deal for themselves by living with grandma,\u201d Cruey said.\n\n\n\nStill, he has high hopes for his kids. He hopes they graduate high school. He hopes they develop a skill. He hopes they experience a life that includes love and support. And he hopes they stay in the area and help revitalize it, stemming the tide of transience and instability.\n\n\n\nHe hopes the same for their parents and those in his community. He has seen the opioid crisis terrorize generations, turning grandparents into caretakers at ages too old, and siblings into caretakers at ages too young.\n\n\n\nThe cycle plays out on a Friday afternoon in May.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s the last period of the day before the weekend, and students are squirming in their seats with anticipation. Over the loudspeaker, a voice calls for \u201cFriday kids\u201d to come to the cafeteria. A group of students suddenly rushes the hallways.\n\nDamon Dahlen/HuffPost Greg Cruey says his students are realistic about their lives. \u201cFor many of them, the horizon is much closer than \u2018When I grow up.\u2019\"\n\nThe \u201cFriday kids\u201d club is not one kids want to join. \u201cFriday kids,\u201d as the school calls them, are those who are given a bag of food to take home for the weekend because otherwise they\u2019d go hungry. It\u2019s up to the students how much they want to share with their siblings.\n\nA few minutes later, an older janitor comes to collect Cruey\u2019s classroom trash. He wishes her a happy Friday.\n\n\u201cI wish it was,\u201d she tells him.\n\nA judge has just ruled that her grandchild can go back to living with her dad, who recently got out of jail for drugs, she explains between tears. Cruey offers to help her write a letter to appeal the decision.\n\nCruey doesn\u2019t know what the students at Southside did in a previous life to be born poor in McDowell County. But he doesn\u2019t see a realistic way to stop the cycle of pain, no matter how well he teaches or how many services the school provides.", "Barbra Streisand was back bashing President Donald Trump on Friday\u2019s broadcast of \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher.\u201d\n\nBut the singer and actress, whose new album \u201cWalls\u201d is a blistering critique of the Trump era, also delivered a rebuke of the media for its coverage of the president.\n\n\u201cI have one question, though.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in what appears to be an attempt to persuade liberals to support her over Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nThe Green Party candidate, Angela Green, endorsed Sinema earlier this week. Sinema is in a tight race with GOP Rep. Martha McSally to replace retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake, and a Democratic victory in the close contest is essential to Democrats\u2019 slim hopes of winning control of the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe mailers, which include an Arizona Republican Party authority line, are framed as an attack on Green and picture her next to Sanders. \u201cAngela Green and Bernie Sanders are too extreme for Arizona,\u201d the mailer reads, before pointing to Green\u2019s \u201cSanders-style agenda\u201d of Medicare for all, marijuana legalization, higher taxes on the wealthy and a 100 percent green energy mandate.\n\nHuffPost\n\n\u201cEvery voter should beware: Arizona Republicans are trying to trick voters into supporting a candidate who has already dropped out of the race,\u201d said Rodd McLeod, a spokesman for Red and Gold, a super PAC supporting Sinema. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s more dirty, dishonest politics from McSally and her pals.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the Arizona GOP didn\u2019t address why it\u2019s attacking a candidate who has dropped out of the race.\n\n\u201cAngela Green has been proudly pushing her extreme progressive agenda, which is out of touch with Arizona,\u201d spokeswoman Ayeshia Connors said. \u201cKyrsten Sinema supports amnesty for illegals, and Sinema is an out-of-the-mainstream liberal as well. The only difference between them is that Kyrsten Sinema is in the witness protection program for liberals, trying to hide her extreme agenda from Arizonans.\u201d\n\nSanders has not endorsed Green, but he also has not formally backed Sinema. She did not attend two rallies Sanders held in Arizona last month. Sinema doesn\u2019t support Medicare for all, one of Sanders\u2019 signature issues.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders has been traveling the country visiting 13 states to try and end one party rule in Washington by electing Democrats up and down the ballot,\u201d Sanders spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis wrote in an e-mail, not addressing whether the democratic socialist supports Sinema.\n\nSinema is potentially vulnerable to efforts to encourage voting for the Green Party nominee because of her record as a moderate. A onetime leftist, Sinema has shifted to the center over the course of her political career and now votes with President Donald Trump more than 50 percent of the time. Liberal activists in the state have occasionally grumbled about supporting her.\n\nWhile Green dropped out of the race earlier this week to back Sinema, extensive early voting in Arizona means ballots for her have almost certainly already been cast.\n\nIn an interview with a local television station, Green said she struggled with her decision to drop out but ultimately decided to back Sinema after watching her debate McSally. \u201cSinema\u2019s stance, on a lot of things, are very similar to mine,\u201d she said.\n\nBREAKING AZ Green Party's U.S. Senate candidate Angela Green tells #12News she's dropping out & throwing support to @kyrstensinema.
