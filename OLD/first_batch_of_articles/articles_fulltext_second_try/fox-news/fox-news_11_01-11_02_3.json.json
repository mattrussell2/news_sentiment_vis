["", "The Supreme Court will let a trial over the decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census go forward, despite a Trump administration objection.\n\nThe justices issued an order Friday rejecting the administration's request to postpone the trial, which is set to start on Monday in New York. In all, more than a dozen states and cities, among other parties, have sued over U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' decision to add a citizenship question to the census for the first time in 70 years.\n\nThe suits argue that Ross acted improperly and that the question will discourage immigrants from participating. The consequence, they argue, would be a diluting of political representation and federal dollars for states that have lots of immigrants and tend to vote Democratic.\n\nThe administration, for its part, says the question will allow the Justice Department to enforce the Voting Rights Act more effectively.\n\nLast week, the justices blocked the questioning of Ross in advance of the trial, but allowed other preparations to continue.\n\nThe judge in the case, U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman, said evidence suggests that Ross may have decided to add the question before asking Justice to request it. He also cited evidence that the secretary had overruled senior Census Bureau staff who said adding the question would be costly and would harm the census count.\n\n\"Most significant, the Court found reason to believe that Secretary Ross had provided false explanations of his reasons for, and the genesis of, the citizenship question,\" Furman said.\n\nLast month, Ross, in a Justice Department filing, said he now remembers speaking with former senior White House adviser Steve Bannon last year about adding a citizenship question to the census. He also recalled discussing the matter with Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the spring of 2017 and at other times, Justice Department lawyers wrote in the filing. Ross previously said under oath that he was unaware of any discussions between himself and anyone in the White House on the subject.\n\nJustices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's first high court designee, would have delayed the trial. The vote of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Trump's other nominee, was not clear from the order, but it would have taken the votes of two more justices to prevent the trial from taking place, The Associated Press reported.\n\nDale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Voting Rights Project, said in a statement: \u201cWe are pleased the Supreme Court rejected this Hail Mary attempt to stop the trial from moving forward. We\u2019ll see the Trump administration in court on Monday.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "bad url", "The case regarding whether or not a Maryland war memorial in the shape of a cross goes against a separation of church and state was accepted for final review by Supreme Court justices on Friday.\n\nThe controversial memorial, which stands in Bladensburg, Maryland, was previously deemed to be in violation of the Constitution by a federal appeals court in Virginia, who determined that it \u201chas the primary effect of endorsing religion and excessively entangles the government in religion.\u201d\n\nIn petitioning the nation\u2019s highest court to take the case, Maryland officials who maintain the monument, otherwise known as the \u201cPeace Cross,\u201d insisted that what it\u2019s meant to honor proves that its purpose is to portray a secular message of remembrance, not one of religion.\n\nShould the appeals court\u2019s decision be allowed to stand, it could potentially affect hundreds of similar monuments across the country and would force \u201cthe removal or dismemberment of a cherished war memorial that has served as a site of solemn commemoration and civic unity for nearly a century,\u201d the officials said.\n\nAPPEALS COURT DENIES BID TO RECONSIDER RULING ON PEACE CROSS\n\nThe cross, finished in 1925, was erected in remembrance of 49 local men who died in World War I. A plaque on the cross' base lists the names of those soldiers, and both faces of the cross have a circle with the symbol of the American Legion, the veterans organization that helped raise money to build it.\n\nThe memorial\u2019s location is roughly five miles from the Supreme Court.\n\nThose in favor of the statue argued that earlier Supreme Court rulings determined that monuments, particularly longstanding ones, which incorporate religious symbolism to send a secular message did not go against the Constitution.\n\nThe shape of the \u201cPeace Cross,\u201d which they maintain falls into that category, was picked as a means to bear a likeness to cross-shaped grave markers used for soldiers buried in American cemeteries overseas, supporters said.\n\nSTATUE OF REVOLUTIONARY WAR GENERAL GIVEN GOOGLY EYES BY PRANKSTER\n\nThe American Humanist Association, the group against the memorial who, along with three local residents, filed a 2014 lawsuit against Maryland officials, argue that the symbol \"discriminates against patriotic soldiers who are not Christian, sending a callous message to non-Christians that Christians are worthy of veneration while they may as well be forgotten.\"\n\nThe organization attempted to persuade the Supreme Court against hearing the case, arguing that the appeals court's ruling is specific to the Bladensburg memorial and doesn't threaten any other monuments.\n\nArguments for the case are expected to be heard in early 2019.\n\nFox News\u2019 Bill Mears and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "", "A rich piece of history was hidden behind a wooden plank inside a wall of a century-old lighthouse in California.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called for a halt to hostilities within 30 days.\n\nGuterres urged the coalition and the Houthis \"to overcome obstacles and resolve differences\" at U.N.-facilitated talks later this month.\n\n\"Violence must stop everywhere,\" preferably immediately, he said.\n\nBut the secretary-general stressed that the U.N.'s immediate priority is to stop the bombing in populated areas and preserve critical infrastructure including in the key port of Hodeida, the main entry point for international aid and 70 percent of food imports that Yemen relies on.\n\nGuterres spoke following the coalition's announcement earlier Friday that it bombed an air base adjacent to the airport in the rebel-held capital Sanaa allegedly being used by the Houthis to launch drone and ballistic missile attacks into Saudi Arabia. Intense fighting was also reported in Hodeida province.\n\n\"It is very important that no missiles or other forms of aggression are sent against Saudi Arabia, and it's very important to stop bombing in urban areas, and it's very important to preserve basic infrastructure,\" the U.N. chief said. \"That is why we are appealing for the kind of military action that is taking place from both sides to end.\"\n\nHe said the United Nations is seeing more and more countries engaged in helping to create conditions for the warring parties to understand not only the need for a cessation of hostilities but for serious political discussions.\n\nThe diplomatic initiative is being driven by the increasing threat of famine, but also by international outrage over the murder of U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi which has put a spotlight on Saudi Arabia's role in the war in Yemen.\n\nRussia's U.N.

In all three, the share of the early vote coming from registered Republicans rose several percentage points when compared with 2016.\n\nIn Arizona, for example, the share of early voters who are registered Republicans is up 3.5 percentage points from 2016.

That indicated the direction of the 2016 final results; all those states did shift Republican compared against 2012 (the shift was large enough to flip Florida and Iowa, but not Nevada, which merely became tighter). Likewise, in Arizona, a rise in 2016 Democratic early voting pointed to an overall shift toward Democrats. Even though President Trump won Arizona, the state was much closer in 2016 than it had been when it went Republican four years earlier.\n\nIn Florida, where outgoing GOP Gov. Rick Scott is running against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, the shift was large enough this year that more Republicans than Democrats early voted. More Republicans than Democrats also early voted in Arizona.\n\nIn Nevada, a state with more registered Democrats than Republicans, Democrats still have an edge in early voting -- but it's 3.28 percentage points smaller than in 2016, a year in which Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto won her race by a close 2.42 points.\n\nA spokesman for Sen. Dean Heller, the embattled Republican fighting to hold back Democrat Jacky Rosen in his re-election fight, told Fox News that his campaign is happy with the numbers.\n\n\"Early vote has shown what we\u2019ve always said was the case: Nevadans are excited to turn out and vote for Dean Heller, who has delivered time and again,\" Keith Schipper, Heller's campaign spokesman, said.\n\nEarly-vote data from Nevada also suggest that recent events did not significantly change turnout. While President Trump publicly worried on Twitter last week that media coverage of mail bombs sent to Democratic figures might hurt Republican early voting, day-by-day data from Nevada compiled by Fox News show fairly similar turnout before and after the package bombs became publicized.\n\nEarly voting is particularly crucial in a state like Nevada, where 69 percent of ballots were cast early in 2016. While the early-vote numbers hold positive signs for Republicans in the three states, the races remain extremely close, and early voting data comes with a host of caveats.\n\nFormer Bush strategist Karl Rove wrote of the pitfalls of reading into early voting in The Wall Street Journal: \"Early voting is only a preview of the election\u2014and not always an accurate one. Trends favoring Republicans may not continue ... independents could break decisively against the GOP; or soft Republicans could cast protest votes, diminishing the party\u2019s apparent improvements.\"\n\nRove went on: \"Moreover, the GOP early-voting advantage could turn out to be fool\u2019s gold: Republicans may be transferring votes from Election Day to early or absentee ballots without expanding the universe of GOP voters.\"\n\nThe types of Republicans and Democrats could also be quite different in a midterm year than in 2016, a general election year.\n\n\"Democrats thought that their lead in early/absentee indicated they would carry [Florida] in 2016. They didn\u2019t,\" Ansolabehere observed.\n\n\"Not all the data is in yet for 2018,\" he added. \"Those two caveats in mind, this is encouraging news for Republican leaders.\"\n\nThe author, Maxim Lott, is Executive Producer of Stossel TV and creator of ElectionBettingOdds.com.

I think it\u2019s cool,\" Musk told Swisher. \"You know, like, when the Air Force was formed, there was a lot of like pooh-poohing, and like, \u201cOh, how silly to have an Air Force!\u201d You know, because the aircraft in World War II were managed by the Army.\"\n\nHe continued: \"And so you had the Army and the Navy and the Coast Guard and the Marines, and then ... it became pretty obvious that you really needed a specialized division to manage aircraft. And so the Air Force was created. And people today may not realize back then it was wildly panned as a ridiculous thing to create the Air Force, but now everyone\u2019s like, 'Obviously, you should have an Air Force.' And I think it\u2019s gonna become obvious that we should have a Space Force, too.\"\n\nNASA IS TEAMING UP WITH A CALIFORNIA SHOE COMPANY TO COMMEMORATE ITS 60TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nWhen Swisher asked him what it would do, given that parts of the Air Force are already responsible for protecting space, Musk said the Space Force would defend space.\n\n\"You know, it\u2019s basically defense in space. And then I think also it could be pretty helpful for maybe expanding our civilization ... You know, expanding things beyond Earth,\" Musk said. \"I think we could just have a base on the moon, for example. A base on Mars. Be great to expand on the idea of a Space Force. Anyone who has an exploratory spirit, and I think that especially applies to a country like the United States, where you know it\u2019s kind of the distillation of the spirit of human exploration. I think the idea of being out there among the stars and among the planets is very exciting.\"\n\nThe full podcast can be listened to here.\n\nThe Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) is the unit of the military focused on space and was recently cited as an example of why the U.S. does not need a Space Force by astronaut Mark Kelly, who called Trump's proposal \"a dumb idea\" in June. Kelly has been mentioned as a possible Democratic congressional candidate in the past and is married to former Rep. Gabby Giffords.\n\nIn June, President Trump ordered the Pentagon to establish a national \u201cspace force\u201d that would become the sixth branch of the armed forces. \u201cWe are going to have a Space Force,\u201d Trump said at a meeting of the National Space Council in Washington D.C. \u201cAn Air Force and a Space Force. Separate, but equal.\u201d\n\nHUBBLE CAPTURES COSMIC 'BAT SHADOW' NEARLY 1,300 LIGHT-YEARS FROM EARTH\n\nThe idea of another branch of the military has come under scrutiny from both sides of the aisle and even the Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, has expressed differing ideas on such a prospect.\n\nIn October 2017, Sec. Mattis wrote letters to several congressmen, including the late Sen. John McCain, then the Chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, saying he opposed \"the creation of a new military service and additional organizational layers at a time when we are focused on reducing overhead and integrating joint warfighting functions.\" In August 2018, Mattis warmed up to the idea, telling reporters that he \"was not against setting up a Space Force,\" before adding that he \"was against rushing to do that before we could define the problem\" that needed solving.\n\nOthers, such as astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson, have said it isn't a \"crazy idea\".\n\nSeparately in August, Vice President Mike Pence said the Trump administration wants the Space Force created by 2020.\n\nThe Associated Press and Fox News' Andrew O'Reilly contributed to this report.

He took aim at Republicans, saying \u201cAmerica\u2019s at a crossroads.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe most of all, the character of our country is on the ballot,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIn the closing weeks of this election we have seen repeated attempts to divide us with rhetoric designed to make us angry and make us fearful. It's designed to exploit our history of racial and ethnic and religious division that pits us against one another.\u201d\n\nObama also took credit for the improving economy under President Trump.\n\n\u201cRight now, Republicans are all, look, the economy is so good,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere do you think that started?\u201d\n\nObama also referenced the Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe, and the indictments of former Trump associates for an assortment of crimes.\n\n\u201cThey promised to take on corruption,\u201d Obama said. \u201cInstead, they have racked up enough indictments to field a football team.

The way I see it is we're looking at two parts of the country. We're looking at the suburbs where Republicans are badly exposed in the House and we're looking at sort of the blue-collar towns and rural parts of the country where President Trump did really well and where there are a lot of big big Senate races... You could see Republicans maybe holding the House by one seat, but it feels like the floor for Democrats is 21-22 seats right now and that's awfully close. (3:09)\n\nOn candidates who wish Trump's closing argument was not about immigration: It really is remarkable when you look at all these polls. Trump's number is pretty much the Republican candidate's number and that wasn't the case in 2016. You had a lot of Republicans that were running 15-20 points ahead of President Trump, especially in these suburban areas. But now President Trump has basically decided, hey I'm not going to keep the House. He said today, 'There's so many House races I can't go to every one of them. I'm going to focus on the Senate.' There's a reason for that. There's a reason he hasn't been dispatched to suburban Philly, Richmond Virginia. These are tough races and their races that he's not particularly popular in, but he can make a difference in Montana where he is going this weekend. He can make a difference in Missouri where I think he can probably seal the deal for Josh Hawley with his appearance today.

Matt Shea of Spokane Valley in conservative eastern Washington is seeking a sixth term in the state House and has been under fire since he acknowledged in a Facebook video last week that he had distributed a four-page document titled, \"Biblical Basis for War\" to some of his supporters.\n\nThe document condemns abortion and same-sex marriage and says how those who don't follow biblical law should be punished, The Spokesman-Review reported . At one point, the document says, \"If they do not yield, kill all males.\"\n\nShea espouses far-right conspiracy theories, mingles with militia groups, considers the U.S. \"a Christian nation\" and champions a push for a 51st state called Liberty, the newspaper reported. But he represents a deeply conservative district that has elected him since 2008, in part because of his business-friendly politics.\n\nShea, a lawyer, has said the document was merely a summary of sermon notes based on the Old Testament and that he was not promoting violence. He did not return a message left Thursday by The Associated Press.\n\nCritics including his Democratic opponent, Ted Cummings, and Republican Spokane County Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich have called the document a guideline for Christian domination.\n\nIt \"appears to call for violence against any political leader who does not share Shea's personal religious views,\" the Freedom From Religion Foundation, a Wisconsin-based nonprofit that advocates for separation of church and state, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nCummings said the attention has apparently triggered a wave of small contributions to his campaign, just five days before the general election.\n\n\"I think the whole nation is watching what goes on here in the 4th (Legislative District) and whether we have the integrity and the intelligence to vote this guy out of office,\" Cummings said.\n\nShea also is facing backlash from some of his donors. The political arm of the Northwest Credit Union Association, which represents more than 180 credit unions in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, gave $1,000 to Shea's campaign before the August primary but recently asked the campaign to return it.\n\n\"His beliefs do not reflect the views and values of the NWCUA, our member credit unions, or the consumers who are credit union members,\" Lynn Heider, the group's vice president for public affairs, said in a statement.\n\nThe Washington Association of Realtors, which donated $2,000 to Shea's campaign, demanded a refund and said its name should be removed from Shea's campaign materials.\n\nAT&T had donated money to the lawmaker but said his statements were divisive and do not reflect the company's \"core values of inclusion and equality.\"\n\n\"We will not be making any future contributions to Rep. Shea's campaign and will ask that he return the $1,000 we contributed to his campaign earlier this year,\" Leland Kim, a spokesman for AT&T, said in an email.\n\nA spokesman for Republican U.S. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who has Shea's endorsement in her race against Democrat Lisa Brown, declined to comment.\n\nFormer Spokane Valley Mayor Diana Wilhite, who ran against Shea in 2008, said too many Republicans support Shea because of his business-friendly policy agenda.\n\n\"If they're Republican, they like the way he votes. And I can't, for the life of me, understand why they don't look at all the other stuff he gets into,\" Wilhite said. \"At some point, character has to count.\"\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Spokesman-Review, http://www.spokesman.com", "Play Audio Clip Listen to audio clip.\n\nFOX News Radio's National Correspondent Jared Halpern along with a team of FOX News reporters & contributors look at the week that was inside the beltway.\n\nTHIS WEEK:\n\nJared sat down with Fox News Politics Editor, Chris Stirewalt, Co-Founder and Publisher of RealClearPolitics, Tom Bevan and Political Editor for National Journal, Josh Kraushaar.

Meanwhile, he was been absent from public campaign rallies.\n\nA spokesman for the former president told the New York Times that Clinton believes \u201cthis election should be about these times and these candidates.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Clinton is encouraged by the large number of impressive Democrats running for office who are personally telling their stories and laying out their vision for how to get America back on track,\u201d spokesman Angel Ure\u00f1a said. \u201cThey are the people voters need to hear from.\u201d\n\nHILLARY CLINTON SAYS, 'I'D LIKE TO BE PRESIDENT,' AT NYC EVENT\n\nWhile not a ubiquitous presence on the campaign trail, former first lady Hillary Clinton has made a few public appearances during the midterms, including recently for the congressional campaign in Florida of Donna Shalala.\n\nThe 2016 Democratic presidential candidate hasn\u2019t ruled out running again for the White House in 2020, recently telling an audience, \u201cI\u2019d like to be president.\u201d", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nProminent Pakistani cleric Maulana Samiul Haq, also known as the \"father of the Taliban,\" was killed in a knife attack at his home in the garrison city of Rawalpindi on Friday, his family and police said.\n\nHaq's son, Hamidul Haq, said his father was alone in his bedroom when he was attacked by an assailant, who escaped undetected.\n\n\"My father has been martyred. He was alone at his home. His guard had gone out minutes before the attack and upon his return he saw my father in critical condition,\" he told reporters.\n\nPolice say Haq, 81, was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died.\n\nYousaf Shah, Haq's spokesman, told The Associated Press that neither the attacker nor their motive was yet known.\n\nSoon after his death, scores of Haq's supporters rioted, damaging shops and vehicles in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Haq's family appealed to his followers to remain peaceful.\n\nA well-known religious scholar with a large following among radical Islamists, Haq was the head of his faction of the Jamiat-e-Ulema Islam (JUI) party.\n\nHaq's sprawling Haqqani seminary taught many of Afghanistan's Taliban and thousands of other students a strict interpretation of Islam.\n\nSirajuddin Haqqani, the deputy leader of the Haqqani network, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, was one of dozens of Taliban leaders who graduated from Haq's seminary, located in the conservative Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province on the border with Afghanistan.\n\nIn recent weeks, dozens of Afghan clerics had appealed to Haq to use his influence with Afghanistan's Taliban to plot a path to peace that would end the 17-year-long war there.\n\nPakistan's President Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned Haq's killing.\n\n\"We lost a great scholar and religious leader today,\" said Khan in a statement from China where he is on an official visit.\n\nKhan was widely criticized for embracing Haq ahead of Pakistan's July elections that put the former cricketer-turned-politician in power. Khan's provincial government in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa donated millions of dollars to Haq's hard-line seminary. He defended the move saying he wanted to see Pakistan's thousands of madrassas, or religious schools, broaden their curriculum.\n\nHaq's funeral is expected to be held Saturday in Akora Khattak.", "U.S. securities investigators have subpoenaed information from Tesla about production forecasts for the Model 3 electric car that were made last year, the company acknowledged in a regulatory filing Friday.\n\nThe disclosure in Tesla's quarterly financial report also says the Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena covered other public statements made about Model 3 production.\n\nThe filing adds that Tesla is cooperating with a Justice Department request for information about Model 3 forecasts.\n\nIt's the first time Tesla has formally disclosed the SEC subpoena in a regulatory filing, but there have been widespread news reports about its investigation into production forecasts.\n\nThe Model 3 is a central part of Tesla's plan to expand from a niche player in the luxury segment to a car maker with broader appeal. It's also key to the company's cash flow and pledge to make quarterly net profits into the future. In 2017 and this year, Tesla had trouble producing the cars, drawing a lawsuit from investors who said they were misled by CEO Elon Musk's production targets.\n\nEarly last year the Palo Alto, California, company announced plans to produce up to 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of 2017. But the company fell far short due to problems with automation at its Fremont, California, factory, making just 793 in the last week of 2017 and 2,700 for the entire year. It didn't hit the 5,000-a-week target until June 2018.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last month that the FBI is doing a criminal investigation into whether Tesla misled investors by overstating Model 3 production forecasts.\n\nTesla Inc. says in the filing that to its knowledge, no government agency in an ongoing investigation has determined that it did anything wrong.\n\nA company spokesman wouldn't comment beyond the filing. Messages were left Friday seeking comment from the SEC and the Justice Department.\n\nIn September, Tesla settled a civil lawsuit by the SEC over tweets by Musk that funding was in place to take the company private. Musk and Tesla agreed to pay a combined $40 million without acknowledging or denying wrongdoing.\n\n\"Aside from the settlement with the SEC relating to Mr. Musk's statement that he was considering taking Tesla private, there have not been any developments in these matters that we deem to be material,\" the company wrote in the filing.\n\nBut the company also says if the government decides to take enforcement action \"there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, and financial position.\"\n\nLast month Tesla reported a $311.5 million profit for the July-through-September period, its first quarterly profit in two years. The company said it produced about 4,300 Model 3s a week, excluding planned shutdowns, and 5,300 in the final week of the quarter.\n\nA year ago, a group of shareholders sued the company in federal court alleging that it made false statements about Model 3 production and misled investors. The original complaint was dismissed but was refiled in September.\n\n\"We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously,\" the company said in its filing.", "Two Kentucky high school students were suspended after they dressed up as the Columbine High School shooters for Halloween.\n\nTwo female students who attended Adair County High School in Columbia, Ky., went to class Wednesday dressed as Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the two teenagers who opened fire at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., on April 20, 1999, killing 12 students and a teacher.

Only pilgrims have been allowed on the main road leading to the monastery since last year's attack.\n\nThe security officials said the attackers opened fire on the two buses carrying pilgrims from Bani Suef and Sohag provinces, also south of Cairo.

Since then, Wickremesinghe has stayed at Temple Trees, insisting he is still the legitimate prime minister and controls a majority in Parliament.\n\nPalitha Range Bandara, a lawmaker from Wickremesinghe's United National Party, told the House speaker on Friday that he had been offered millions of dollars and a minister portfolio to cross over to Rajapaksa's new government.\n\nMahindananda Aluthgamage, a lawmaker from Rajapaksa's party, denied the allegations.\n\n\"We don't have such money to offer anybody,\" he said.\n\nKabir Hasheem, the UNP chairman and, until last week, the government's minister of highways and road development, said other lawmakers had described similar offers, but that the majority in Parliament was holding out.\n\nOn Friday, 119 lawmakers in the 225-member Parliament signed a letter urging Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to reconvene the body immediately.\n\nRajapaksa said Thursday that Sirisena would summon lawmakers as soon as Nov. 5. Since Monday, Sirisena has handed out 14 Cabinet posts, including to five lawmakers who defected from Wickremesinghe's coalition, and made Rajapaksa finance minister.\n\nAt Temple Trees, all but two dozen of the more than 1,000 security guards usually stationed there have withdrawn. The government has kept about 15 plainclothes guards to protect the sprawling complex itself, while 10 others have remained to guard Wickremesinghe.\n\nSupporters and young Buddhist monks wandered freely through the complex, making a violent eviction of Wickremesinghe unlikely.\n\nRajapaksa, Sri Lanka's president from 2005 to 2015, is credited by Sri Lanka's Sinhalese ethnic majority with ending a 25-year civil war with the Tamil Tigers, a militant group of minority Tamils fighting for independence.\n\nStill, even after persuading lawmakers to lift term limits, Rajapaska lost a re-election bid in 2015 amid accusations of nepotism, corruption and wartime atrocities. Since then, he and his brothers Basil Rajapaksa and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, his former defense secretary, have been working to reclaim power. Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (Sri Lanka People's Front), the party they formed in 2016, swept local elections in 2018, an embarrassing defeat for Wickremesinghe's United National Front, a coalition formed with Sirisena in 2015 to defeat Rajapaksa.\n\nWickremesinghe's government was also sharply criticized last year after handing over operations of a port Rajapaksa had developed with Chinese loans to a Chinese company. The ousted prime minister said Friday it was an open-bidding process.\n\n\"The Chinese were giving the loans and had been given the first option. And if you're not satisfied, give it to others.

The dark, occultish elements in \u2018Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\u2019 provide reason enough for parents to keep their children -- including teens -- far away from this show,\u201d Sprigg said. \u201cThe show has gone over the top in depicting an actual orgy on screen, and if they think having the teen participants keep their underwear on makes it all right, the writers and producers need to think again. This content is not appropriate for anyone, but especially not for the teen audience it targets.\u201d\n\nNetflix and Warner Bros. did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n\nShowrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa\u2019s other series, CW\u2019s \u201cRiverdale,\u201d also features a similarly uncomfortable striptease hot tub scene with characters who are underage. \u201cSabrina\u201d is billed as a companion series to the CW hit, which has been criticized for similar provocative content. \"Riverdale\" is also based on an Archie comic, but both of Aguirre-Sacasa\u2019s shows have ditched the wholesome family values of the original intellectual property.\n\nA spokesperson for Aguirre-Sacasa did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cChilling Adventures of Sabrina\u201d and \u201cRiverdale\u201d are hardly the first two shows to sexualize teens, as The CW's \u201cGossip Girl,\u201d Freeform's \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d and a variety of MTV programs are recent examples. Most cases involve adult-age actors playing teens in order to get away with erotic storylines -- with \u201cSabrina\u201d being no exception. However, some media gurus feel things are getting worse in the modern era of prestige TV.\n\n\u201cIt's ill-advised for Netflix to go down this road given the climate. With no advertisers to answer to, it seems they'll take the controversy and press it will generate over any kind of subscriber backlash,\" The Hill's media reporter Joe Concha told Fox News.\n\nMedia Research Center Vice president Dan Gainor criticized Netflix as \u201cwoke TV,\u201d pointing to \u201cSabrina\u201d as an example of why parents must proceed with caution before allowing children access to the streaming giant.\n\n\u201cThis depraved show promotes teen sex and witchcraft. Parents need to know that's what their kids might be watching when they tune in Netflix,\u201d Gainor told Fox News.\n\nCommercial artist Troy Riser was among the outspoken critics on social media, sending numerous tweets condemning Netflix for the \u201corgy scene\u201d and even declaring that \u201ctraditional kid-friendly brands such as the Archie Comics universe should not be used to market softcore porn.\u201d Riser\u2019s children are adults now, but when reached by Fox News he explained that he\u2019s concerned for today\u2019s youth.\n\n\u201cPackaging adult entertainment in a traditionally family-friendly brand is pretty disturbing stuff,\u201d Riser told Fox News. \u201cI'm thinking more about children in general -- young girls in particular -- who would gravitate to a show about 'Sabrina the Teenage Witch,' a show many parents would naturally think would be kid-safe given their own memories of Archie comics and the G-rated Melissa Joan Hart show several years ago.\u201d", "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for \u2014 fashion?\n\nNASA is teaming up with California shoe company Vans to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the space agency.

We hear volumes of information about the Marine Corps vertical-take-off-and-landing F-35B, Navy carrier-launched F-35C and Air Force F-35A - but what does the Army think of the emerging Joint Strike Fighter?\n\nDoes the Army think the 5th-Gen stealth fighter would bring substantial value to targeting and attacking enemy ground forces in close proximity to advancing infantry? What kind of Close Air Support could it bring to high-risk, high-casualty ground war?\n\n\u201cWhen you are in a firefight, the first thing infantry wants to do it get on that radio to adjust fire for mortars and locate targets with close air support with planes or helicopters. You want fires. The F-35 has increased survivability and it will play a decisive role in the support of ground combat,\u201d Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told reporters at the Association of the United States Army Annual Symposium.\n\nGen. Milley\u2019s comments are quite significant, given the historic value of close air support when it comes to ground war. His remarks also bear great relevance regarding the ongoing Pentagon evaluation assessing the F-35 and A-10 Warthog in close air support scenarios.\n\nOver the years, close-air-support to Army ground war has of course often made the difference between life and death - victory or defeat. The Army, Milley said, wants next-generation close-air-support for potential future warfare.\n\n\u201cWe fight with the Navy, Marines and Air Force. Our soldiers have never heard an Air Force pilot say \u2018I can\u2019t fly into that low-altitude area,\u2019 These guys take incredible risk. If there are troops on the ground, they are rolling in hot,\u201d Milley said.\n\nWhile Milley, of course, did not specifically compare the A-10 to the F-35 or say the Army prefers one aircraft over another, he did say the F-35 would be of great value in a high-stakes, force-on-force ground war.\n\nLong-revered by ground troops as a \u201cflying-tank,\u201d the combat-proven A-10 has been indispensable to ground-war victory. Its titanium hull, 30mm cannon, durability, built-in redundancy and weapons range has enabled the aircraft to sustain large amounts of small arms fire and combat damage - and keep flying.\n\nAt the same time, as newer threats emerge and the high-tech F-35 matures into combat, many U.S. military weapons developers and combatant commanders believe the JSF can bring an improved, new-generation of CAS support to ground troops. Thus - the ongoing Office of the Secretary of Defense comparison.\n\nAccordingly, the Pentagon-led F-35/A-10 assessment is nearing its next phase of evaluation, following an initial \u201cfirst wave\u201d of tests in July of this year, Vice Adm. Mat Winter, Program Executive Officer, F-35 program, recently told a group of reporters.\n\n\u201cMission performance is under evaluation,\u201d Winter said.\n\nPre- Initial Operational Test & Evaluation test phases are currently underway at Edwards AFB and Naval Air Station China Lake, officials said.\n\n\u201cMission performance is being evaluated in the presence of a robust set of ground threats and, to ensure a fair and comparable evaluation of each system\u2019s performance, both aircraft are allowed to configure their best weapons loadouts and employ their best tactics for the mission scenario\u201d a statement from the Director, Operational Test & Evaluation said.\n\nUpon initial examination, some might regard a stealthy, 5th-Gen F-35 as ill-equipped or at least not-suited for close air support. However, a closer look does seem to uncover a handful of advantages - speaking to the point Milley mentioned about survivability.\n\nLong-range, computer-enabled F-35 sensors could enable the aircraft to see and destroy enemy ground targets with precision from much higher altitudes and much farther ranges than an A-10 could; the speed of an F-35, when compared to an A-10, would potentially make it better able to maneuver, elude enemy fire and get into position for attack; like the A-10s 30mm gun, the F-35 has its own 25mm cannon mounted on its left wing which could attack ground forces; given its sensor configuration, with things like a 360-degree Distributed Aperture System with cameras, the F-35 brings a drone-like ISR component to air-ground war. This could help targeting, terrain analysis and much-needed precision attacks as U.S. soldiers fight up close with maneuvering enemy ground forces.\n\nAn F-35 might be better positioned to respond quickly to enemy force movement; in the event that enemy air threats emerge in a firefight, an F-35 could address them in a way an A-10 could not, obviously; an F-35 would be much better positioned to locate enemy long-range fires points of combat significance and destroy hostile artillery, mortar or long-range-fires launching points. Finally, while the A-10 has a surprisingly wide envelope of weapons, an F-35 could travel with a wider range of air-ground attack weapons - armed with advanced targeting technology.\n\nAlso, fighter-jet close air support is by no means unprecedented. F-22s were used against ISIS, F-15s were used against insurgents in Iraq - and the F-35 recently had its combat debut in Afghanistan.\n\nThere are, however, some unknowns likely to be informing the current analysis. How much small arms fire could an F-35 withstand? Could it draw upon its \u201chovering\u201d technology to loiter near high-value target areas? To what extent could it keep flying in the event that major components, such as engines or fuselage components, were destroyed in war? How much could A-10 weapons and targeting technology be upgraded?\n\nRegardless of the conclusions arrived upon by the ongoing assessment, it is likely both the A-10 and F-35 will perform CAS missions in the immediate years ahead.\n\nWhen it comes to the Army and the F-35, one can clearly envision warfare scenarios wherein Army soldiers could be supported by the Marine Corps F-35B, Navy F-35C or Air Force F-35A.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t fight as an Army - we fight as a joint force. What makes us different is the synergistic effect we get from combining various forces in time and space,\u201d Milley said.\n\nMore Weapons and Technology - WARRIOR MAVEN (CLICK HERE)", "Separatist militants attacked workers on a state-run rubber plantation in restive southwestern Cameroon, chopping off their fingers because the men had defied an order to stay away from the farms, authorities said Friday.\n\nThe attack is the second of its kind in less than a week by the militants, who have responded violently to a government crackdown on separatist activities in the English-speaking parts of the country.\n\nDavid Epie, a 43-year-old worker at a rubber plantation, says armed men attacked him and three of his co-workers on Thursday evening.\n\n\"I do not know the fate of one of our workers who tried to escape and was shot on the leg,\" said Epie, who lost several fingers.

The headline was that the administration, as expected, would restore the final round of sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the controversial 2015 Iran nuclear deal -- though there would be exemptions for eight countries.\n\nBut then President Trump stepped in with extra flair, tweeting the following meme from the Westeros Wing:\n\nIt's unclear who created the movie-style poster image, and whether House (John) Bolton was consulted.\n\nBut HBO reportedly objected to their \"trademark\" being \"misappropriated.\"\n\nThe hit show's stars were not amused either.\n\nOn the earlier conference call, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the sanctions on Iran\u2019s shipping, financial and energy sectors. The sanctions will target Iran\u2019s crude oil exports and will penalize countries that don\u2019t stop importing oil and foreign companies that do business with certain Iranian entities.\n\nPompeo said that the sanctions are intended to fundamentally change the Iranian regime's behavior. But the administration also announced that there would be eight significant reduction exemptions (SREs) for countries that haven\u2019t completely eliminated oil imports from Iran. The waivers will last for a six-month period and will be re-evaluated after that time is up. The Associated Press reported that those exempted include Italy, India, Japan and South Korea.\n\nUnited Against Nuclear Iran, a non-partisan advocacy group, welcomed the sanctions but expressed concern about the waivers.\n\n\"We encourage the Trump administration to fulfill the promise of a maximum pressure campaign \u2013 no exceptions \u2013 until Iran permanently and verifiably changes its behavior,\" Chairman and former Sen. Joe Liberman and CEO Mark Wallace, a former U.N. ambassador, said in a statement. \"Oil and gas firms, including those from friendly countries like India, South Korea and Japan, should not be granted sanctions waivers.\"\n\nThe move is the latest round of sanctions re-imposed since President Trump announced the U.S. exit from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. In August the administration re-imposed a host of economic sanctions, drawing criticism from European leaders in particular.\n\n\"We deeply regret the further re-imposition of sanctions by the United States, due to the latter\u2019s withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA),\" E.U.

Security Council through Resolution 2231. It is crucial for the security of Europe, the region, and the entire world.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly blasted the deal, which critics say does not do enough to end Iran\u2019s aggression in the region. At a U.N. Security Council meeting in September, Trump defended his administration\u2019s decision to pull out of the Obama-era deal, and blasted what he called a \u201chorrible, one-sided deal [that] allowed Iran to continue its path toward a [nuclear] bomb and gave the regime a cash lifeline when they needed it the most.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were in big big trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cThey needed cash, we gave it to them.\u201d\n\nTrump said that in addition to the November sanctions, the U.S. \"will pursue additional sanctions, tougher than ever before, to counter the entire range of Iran's malign conduct.\"\n\n\"Any individual or entity who fails to comply with these sanctions will face severe consequences,\" he warned.\n\nFox News' Nicholas Kalman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "Andrew Gillum may be ahead in the polls as he bids to become Florida's next governor, but the Tallahassee mayor's association with a radical far-left group associated with Palestinian terrorism has left his campaign mired in allegations of anti-Semitism and could yet prove costly with the state's 600,000 Jewish voters.\n\nRepublican opponent Ron DeSantis has repeatedly brought up Gillum\u2019s relationship with Dream Defenders, a Florida-based group that claims to build \u201cpowerful, deep, local\u201d organization for \u201cfreedom and liberation\u201d in the state, pointing to the anti-Israel activism, including the promotion of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against the Jewish state.\n\nDespite the accusations of anti-Semitism, Gillum has ignored the growing calls to disavow the group even as the largest Jewish weekly publication in the country, the Jewish Press, urged Florida\u2019s Jewish residents to vote for DeSantis, potentially swaying the election to the Republican.\n\nDream Defenders and Gillum have an extensive history.

He did not elaborate.\n\nYemen's rebel-run al-Masirah TV said more than 30 airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition targeted the air base and surrounding areas in the rebel-held capital.\n\nThe airstrikes came days after a U.S. call for an urgent halt to the Saudi-Iran proxy war in Yemen and the start of negotiations in November toward a political settlement of the conflict. The war has pushed millions to the brink of starvation in the Arab world's poorest country.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday urged a cease-fire, specifically citing missile and drone strikes into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. He also said airstrikes by the Arab coalition, backed by the U.S., \"must cease in all populated areas in Yemen.\"\n\n\"The time is now for a cessation of hostilities,\" Pompeo said. His plea came shortly after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis spoke in unusual detail about diplomacy to end the crisis.\n\n\"Yemen has more problems than any people deserve to carry,\" Mattis said.\n\nThe U.S. call comes nearly a month after the slaying of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi Consulate in Turkey causing international outrage against the Saudis. The killing prompted critics to urge an end to American arms sales to the kingdom and a reappraisal of U.S. military support for the Saudi-led Arab coalition that has been bombing Iranian-supported Houthi rebels, sometimes at the expense of killing civilians.\n\nIn March 2015, the Saudi-led coalition unleased a full-scale military campaign against Iran-allied Houthi rebels who had captured most of Yemen including the capital, Sanaa, a few months earlier. The rebels pushed the internationally recognized government out of the country.\n\nAn estimated 10,000 people have been killed. The war has also left around two-thirds of Yemen's population of 27 million relying on aid, and more than 8 million at risk of starvation.\n\nThe humanitarian crisis in Yemen is one of the worst in the world, with three quarters of the population requiring some form of life-saving assistance and protection, according to the United Nations Population Fund. The agency warned Thursday that the looming famine in war-torn Yemen could put 2 million mothers at risk of death.\n\nUNFPA said lack of food, displacement, poor nutrition, disease outbreaks and eroding health care have dramatically affected the health and well-being of 1.1 million malnourished women who are pregnant or are breast-feeding their newborns.\n\nThe U.N. has made no progress in attempts to get the warring sides to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict.", "The North Dakota Democratic Party is discouraging hunters from voting in the upcoming election, claiming they could lose their out-of-state hunting licenses if they do so.\n\n\u201cAttention hunters: If you vote in North Dakota, you may forfeit hunting licenses you have in other states.

What exactly are next Tuesday's midterm elections about?\n\nWell, on the one side, it's pretty clear. Donald Trump, who is the leader of the Republican party and in effect, it's only spokesman, says that a vote for Republican candidates is a vote for secure borders and against crime and chaos. You don't have to believe the president when he says this but it's definitely what Republicans are running on.\n\nWhat are Democrats running on? That's less clear. They're against Trump, certainly. Democrats talk about the president even more than he talks about himself -- which is a lot! They don't like him at all. Fine. But despising someone isn't really a platform or path forward, at best it's a reaction.\n\nWhat are the ideas that unite the Democratic Party, right now? For the answer to that, we go to the other cable stations which over the past couple of years have come to function much as the DNC used to function. It's the Democratic Party's brain trust and mouthpiece.\n\nIf you want to know what Democrats are thinking? Watch CNN and MSNBC. Wednesday night was especially instructive.\n\nHere are two contributors to MSNBC. One writes for \"The New York Times.\" The other is at Princeton which is an Ivy League college in New Jersey.\n\nBoth have impressive credentials, both are considered deep thinkers by most of the other people in this country who think of themselves as intellectuals. Here\u2019s how they explained what they have learned since the 2016 election:\n\nEDDIE GLAUDE, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY; MSNBC ANALYST: What I did wrong in 2016 is I overestimated white people. I didn't think white people would put him in office.\n\nMARA GAY, NEW YORK TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD: I'm not willing to let white voters off the hook. I think that they, like the rest of us, should be treated as adults and I think that there conscience, who are good Americans. And I that they need to move from saying, well, I don't like his tweets but the economy is doing OK. They need to move from there to reality which is that we have a white nationalist president who's a threat to American democracy. are a large number, I would say the majority of white Americans in this country who are not just Democrats but who are people of conscience, who are good Americans. And I believe that they need to move from saying, well, I don't like his tweets but the economy is doing OK. They need to move from there to reality which is that we have a white nationalist president who's a threat to American democracy.\n\nNow there was a time, not so long ago, just a few years ago really, when language like this was considered textbook race hatred even by liberal Democrats. You weren't allowed to blame entire races of people for anything. You weren't even supposed to think of your fellow Americans primarily in terms of their race -- and skin color is one thing that nobody can control.\n\nTo paraphrase a long time liberal hero whose ideas are now ignored, what matters is the content of a person's character. But not anymore. Now the opposite is true, identity is everything. Here is CNN's Don Lemon on Monday night:\n\n\u201cSo, we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right. And we have to start doing something about them. There is no travel ban on them. There is no ban on -- You know, they had the Muslim ban, there is no white guy ban. So, what do we do about that?\u201d\n\n\"We have to start doing something about them, these people of a certain skin color.\" That's what Don Lemon said.\n\nNow before you get too outraged about that and stop watching his show every night, keep in mind that Don Lemon is a cable news host, he's on LIVE television, five hours a week. He's bound to say something indefensible once in a while, they all do. We can actually vouch for that having done it ourselves -- unfortunately.\n\nBut here are the rules. When you say something awful that you can't defend, don't try to defend it. Apologize. Explain what you meant and move on. Vow to do better. That's a rule for life, not just television news. We all learned it as kids. On the left though, it no longer applies.\n\nHere's what Don Lemon said Wednesday night about his remarks on Monday:\n\n\u201cI said that the biggest terror threat in this country comes from radicals on the far right, primarily white men. That angered some people. Their analysis shows that for every eight deadly attacks by right-wing extremists, there were one by left-wing extremists. Those are the facts. So, people who were angered about what I said are missing the entire point. We don't need to worry about people that are thousands of miles away. The biggest threats are homegrown.\u201d\n\nIf you didn't like what I said, that's your problem. You'll notice the lack of contrition when Don Lemon said, we have to start doing something about Americans of a certain skin color.\n\nIt turns out it wasn't a mistake -- he meant that. He didn't apologize because nobody in his world asked him to. They are all saying pretty much the same thing.\n\nThis is now a common view in the Democratic Party, it's one of the things they're running on.\n\nNow lots of Americans won't like that message obviously but Democrats are not concerned about that. They no longer care what those Americans think. They've given up on trying to represent them. -- And that's why they fight harder to provide birthright citizenship for foreigners than they ever fought to protect American citizens from heroin or plunging middle-class wages or privacy-destroying tech monopolies.\n\nThey know who their constituency is.\n\nThat also explains their sudden sympathy for lawbreakers over everyone else.\n\nYou already know about the Democrats' demand that America ignore its own immigration laws, but it's gone far beyond that.\n\nElizabeth Warren, who is the Democratic senator from Massachusetts and who is running for president in 2020, has condemned our entire criminal justice system as irredeemably racist.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hollywood Senate candidate in Texas, Beto O'Rourke, agrees with that. He's called our justice system \"the new Jim Crow.\"\n\nHe accused cops of shooting people based on their skin color. Now, he offered no evidence that cops do shoot people just based on their skin color. -- He didn't need to because he just knows it's true.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic cities around the country have decided that laws against crimes like shoplifting and public urination and others can no longer be enforced because that would be racist.\n\nNow the result of all of this is inevitable. It's always the same -- everywhere. There\u2019s more crime. And you're already seeing that in many places.\n\nTurns out the crime victims are not cloistered rich people like Beto O'Rourke, they are normal people of all races. Crime hurts everyone but it tends to hurt the poor the most.\n\nIf that's occurred to Democrats, they haven't mentioned it. They're feeling good about themselves right now. They know they're likely to win back the House on Tuesday and they're feeling vindicated, more self-righteous than ever.\n\nWe searched long and hard today for a comment on tape that could sum up the Democratic worldview, right now and we found this. It was shot by a network cameraman covering the president's trip to the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, this week. The protester screaming at the president happens to be a Presbyterian minister. Here\u2019s what she said:\n\n\u201cIt's not about you. Let the families grieve, this is our neighborhood. You are not welcome here. You don't belong here. This is our neighborhood. We welcome everybody here.\"\n\n\u201cYou are not welcome here! We welcome everybody.\u201d Well, that's pretty much the whole Democratic message right there.\n\nWill it work? Maybe on Tuesday, maybe for a little while.\n\nAngela Merkel tried it in Germany. So did the people who until recently ran Brazil, but ultimately their countries rejected that message.\n\nVoters want you to care about them, it's their country. And they'll know it if you don't care about them. And in the end they will punish you for that, they always do.\n\nAdapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" on November 1, 2018.", "A Good Samaritan who stopped to help victims of a car crash on a California freeway died Thursday after she was hit by an SUV, authorities said.\n\nThe woman, identified as 19-year-old Bertha Aida Estrada by the San Diego County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, had stopped along the eastbound lanes of state Route 94 after witnessing the crash.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol said an 82-year-old woman driving a gray Mercedes sedan was rear-ended by a 23-year-old woman driving a Honda Civic, the San Diego Tribune reported.\n\nAfter getting hit, the driver of the Mercedes lost control of the vehicle and slammed into the concrete wall of the center divider.

A new Catalan separatist administration has kept up a defiant pro-independence rhetoric but hasn't broken the law.\n\nSpain's Supreme Court wrapped up last month the probe into 18 politicians and activists for their links to the turbulent events.\n\nFour more officials who were in charge of the regional police are being investigated in the country's National Court and were also indicted on Friday, with prosecutors calling for 11 years of imprisonment for the former regional police chief, Josep Lluis Trapero.\n\nBoth trials are expected to begin in early 2019.\n\nFriday's highly expected indictment didn't involve the Catalan politicians who have fled the country, including the former regional president, Carles Puigdemont, who now lives in Belgium and Spain is considered a fugitive.\n\nJunqueras, who stayed in Spain and was jailed preventively exactly one year ago, could also face a ban from holding public office for the next 25 years if the judges agree during the upcoming trial.\n\nThe second-highest prison terms in the indictments \u2014 17 years \u2014 were for Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez, activists who at the time headed two civil society groups pushing for Catalan independence, and also for Carme Forcadell, who was the Catalan parliament's speaker.\n\nWeeks after the banned referendum went ahead amid violence against voters when police tried to stop it, Forcadell presided over a tense house session where a narrow separatist majority of lawmakers passed an independence declaration.\n\nThe declaration didn't have any immediate effect and instead prompted central authorities to move swiftly to take over control of Catalonia.\n\nUnder the Spanish criminal code, rebellion punishes with prison terms ranging from 15 to 30 years to those who \"rise violently and publicly'\" against the government or the country's constitution.\n\nIn a separate indictment on Friday, state attorneys representing the central government called for the case to be tried as the lesser charge of sedition, which doesn't involve violence and can be punished with a maximum of 15 years in prison.\n\nThe different criteria between the public prosecutor and the state attorneys could have limited effect in the trial. But the fact that the latter has dropped the rebellion charge is seen as a sign of how the center-left government of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez needs support in parliament from separatist parties to pass the national budget and remain in power.", "Two people were wounded and one person was arrested after a stabbing attack Friday at Sony headquarters in London, police said.\n\nThere was no evidence of firearms involved in the incident and it wasn\u2019t being treated as terror-related, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police said in a tweet.

Hi, I'm Gerri Willis from the Fox Business Network and host of the podcast, Rich is Not a Four-Letter Word. Volatility. That's what we've got in the stock market these days and whether you're an active investor in stocks or simply a set it and forget it 401(k) holder, you need to understand what to expect. Fortunately we have Lindsey Bell, CFRA investment strategist, in to talk about what you need to do during these volatile times. Navigating rocky markets can be frightening but as Lindsey will show, a little information can make the trip easier. Here are the takeaways: Understand the in insider market talk. It's really not that hard. A pullback is a market decline of 5 percent to 9.9 percent. Pullbacks are common, happening once every nine months, and recovering takes a mere one and a half months. According to CFRA, we've had 56 bull-market pullbacks since World War II. A correction is a pullback of 10 percent to 19.9 percent and a bear market is a decline of 20 percent from highs. Lindsey says a bear market is usually caused by the economy falling into recession and, she says, that doesn't appear to be in the cards, not now, anyway.\n\nStay faithful to tech. According to Lindsey, technology stocks still have the best growth potential among major stock sectors. Even though so-called FANG stocks, Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Google, have led the markets for sometime now, their fortunes are more secure because their fundamentals are sound, she says.\n\nThe biggest threat to the market? Lindsey says it's the Federal Reserve, and higher interest rates. The Fed is on target for at least one more rate hike this year, and Lindsey says that over doing the rate hikes to wring inflation out of the economy is the biggest potential problem for markets. Higher rates clip stock performance as companies face higher operating costs.\n\nTake a listen to the podcast! Follow me on Twitter @gerriwillisFBN and on Facebook, where my handle is GerriWillis.

A police spokesman says it was handed to her on Sept. 4 following an interview on LBC radio.\n\nLBC had in its possession an internal Labour Party dossier that detailed 45 cases that involved social media postings by party members, including one posting that read: \"We shall rid the Jews who are a cancer on us all.\"\n\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has over the past couple of years struggled to rebut persistent charges of anti-Semitism in his party ranks, including complaints raised by some party legislators who are Jewish. He has said the party deplores all racism, but the issue has lingered.\n\nAmanda Bowman, vice president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said the group was not surprised by the criminal investigation.\n\n\"There is a deeply embedded culture of anti-Semitism in parts of the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn has done close to nothing to address it, to the extent that some cases may now even meet a criminal threshold,\" she said.\n\nThe police statement says the person making the complaint \"alleged that the documentation included evidence of anti-Semitic hate crimes. The contents have been examined by specialist officers. A criminal investigation has commenced into some of the allegations within the documentation.\"\n\nPolice say the force is seeking \"early investigative advice\" from the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nDick told BBC radio there is evidence a crime may have been committed based on the material given to her.\n\n\"If somebody passes us material which they say amounts to a crime we have a duty to look at that and not just dismiss it,\" she said.\n\n\"We have been assessing some material that was passed to me, in a radio studio of all things, about two months ago and we are now investigating some of that material because it appears there may have been crime committed.\"\n\nShe said police prefer it if political parties \"regulate themselves.\" Dick added that she hopes the matter can be dealt with quickly.\n\nPolice did not provide details about the possible hate crimes detailed in the dossier.\n\nLabour Party officials say the party has not been contacted by police but is ready to cooperate.\n\nA party spokesman said the party has a \"robust system for investigating complaints of alleged breaches of Labour Party rules by its members.\"", "A dozen migrants traveling by foot from Honduras to the U.S. to seek asylum filed a class-action lawsuit Thursday against President Trump, the Department of Homeland Security and others, claiming a violation of their due process under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment states that, \"no person\u2026 shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\"\n\nA recent PBS report cited former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who ruled in 1993 case that \"it is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in a deportation proceeding.\"\n\nTwelve Honduran nationals, including six children, are listed as plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The suit, which was filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., said it is widely known that Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador are \u201cundergoing a well-documented human rights crisis.\u201d The lawsuit also claims that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to the Administrative Procedures Act and the Declaratory Judgement Act were being infringed upon.\n\nThe Central American migrant caravan now numbers approximately 4,000 people, down from a high of 7,200.\n\nThe lawsuit points to Trump's claim that he will prevent the caravan from entering the U.S. It claims that the president cannot stop asylum-seekers by employing the military -- when they have a fair claim. The suit criticized the president's alleged attempt at stoking \"fear and hysteria\" by claiming that criminals and gang members have joined the caravan.\n\nThe suit cited a Trump interview with Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham, where the president laid out plans to build tent cities to house migrants. The suit questioned the functionality of such a project, and asked if these living quarters would qualify under the Flores Agreement of 1997. The agreement protects asylum-seekers\u2019 rights and limits how long minors can be held.\n\nEarlier this summer, a federal judge in California rejected a request by the administration to modify Flores to allow for longer family detention. Administration officials say they have the authority to terminate the agreement, but that is likely to be tested in court.\n\nThe White House, Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security -- which were all named as defendants -- did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n\nTrump announced in a lengthy speech at the White House on Thursday afternoon that in response to what he called the \"crisis at our southern border\" and a surge of fraudulent asylum claims in recent years, his administration will soon require asylum-seekers to \"lawfully present themselves\" at a port of entry.\n\nAsylum claims made by migrants caught crossing the border illegally would seemingly be summarily denied under Trump's proposal.\n\nThe asylum clause of the Immigration and Nationality Act says that anyone who arrives to the U.S. may apply for asylum based on a well-founded fear of persecution, and Trump's decision was expected to prompt immediate federal court challenges.\n\nNexus Services Inc. is funding the lawsuits through a civil rights law firm called Nexus Derechos Humanos (Human Rights) Attorneys Inc.\n\n\"Federal law enables migrants to apply for asylum in the United States. President Trump and his administration have used \u2018increased enforcement,\u2019 like separating families and lengthening detention to violate migrant rights,\" Mike Donovan, president of Nexus Services, said in the release.\n\nThere is another legal issue at stake, according to the lawsuit. The U.S. cannot send troops into Mexico to cut off the caravan from crossing the border, it said. Even with the National Guard at the border, once an immigrant indicates an intention to apply for asylum, the suit maintained the process has begun.\n\nImmigrants who are seeking asylum must be referred for a \u201ccredible fear interview,\u201d for which an asylum officer would determine if the immigrant has a \u201ccredible fear of persecution,\u201d the lawsuit said. If the officer makes that determination, then there is a significant chance for the asylum-seeker to be granted asylum, according to the suit.\n\nFox News' Gregg Re and The Associated Press contributed to this report", "Dutch prosecutors said Friday they have closed their investigation without unravelling the mystery of how a Croatian ex-general managed to smuggle poison into a United Nations courtroom and take his own life, seconds after an appeals judge confirmed his 20-year sentence for war crimes.\n\nSlobodan Praljak committed suicide Nov. 29 last year, proclaiming his innocence and then drinking from a small bottle containing potassium cyanide.

He said he went to Syria in June 2015 to see for himself what was really happening and how the conflict affected ordinary people, including women and children, as well as soldiers.\n\nYasuda, a respected journalist known for his coverage of conflict zones, admitted he made a wrong decision while crossing into Syria when his local escort suddenly changed plans and Yasuda followed a pair of unknown guides instead. The pair grabbed him, pushed him into the car and kept him at a house.\n\n\"I chose the wrong way ... It was an unthinkable silly mistake,\" he said, adding that he is fully accountable for his suffering.\n\n\"To everyone who assisted to secure my release and those who worried about me, I deeply apologize and would like to express my sincere appreciation.

A war monitoring group said Yasuda was recently held by a Syrian commander with the Turkistan Islamic Party, which mostly comprises Chinese jihadis in Syria. Yasuda said he held at a prison run by Uighurs earlier this year \u2014 one of several places he was moved around during his 40-month captivity.\n\nHe was released on Oct. 23 when the captors took him to a meeting point to hand him over to Turkish authorities. They removed his blindfold as they arrived at the immigration center in Antakya in southern Turkey.\n\nWhile the public generally welcomed Yasuda's safe return, some criticized him as a fearless troublemaker. In a country where those who act independently are often considered selfish and receive little sympathy when they fail, some tweets demanded Yasuda apologize for causing trouble for the government. Past hostages have faced similar criticism upon returning home.\n\nYasuda started reporting on the Middle East in the early 2000s and went to Afghanistan and Iraq. He was taken hostage in Iraq in 2004 with three other Japanese, but was freed after Islamic clerics negotiated his release.\n\nSyria has been one of the most dangerous places for journalists since the conflict there began in March 2011, with dozens killed or kidnapped.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mariyamaguchi", "All eyes have been on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle since their stunning wedding ceremony in May. Harry and the Duchess of Sussex have forged their own path as a royal couple \u2014 often straying from tradition in the process.\n\nWhile Markle has adhered to some British royal etiquette standards, the former actress hasn't completely transformed her style and social behavior. And Harry has followed suit, as he often displays public affection for his new bride.\n\n\"Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are pioneering a new, relaxed, tactile branch of the monarchy,\" William Hanson, who describes himself as the U.K.'s \"leading etiquette expert and coach,\" recently told The Daily Mail while discussing Markle's latest fashion faux pas.\n\nMany royal enthusiasts tend to agree \u2014 the pair is unlike any other royal couple, especially compared to Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S APPARENT 'BAD' HABIT SPARKS ROYAL DEBATE\n\nHere's a list of seven times Meghan and Harry have, both as a couple and individually, broken \"royal protocol\" in recent months.\n\nPDA moments\n\nFirst of all, the parents-to-be don't shy away from showing their fondness for one another. They're often caught holding hands, hugging and even sneaking an occasional smooch or two.\n\nWhile there isn't an official rule on PDA, The Sun points out it's generally considered \"uncouth\" of a royal couple. Their public affection should be based on the formality of the event they're attending and reflect the queen's behavior. Unlike Prince William and Kate Middleton, Harry and Markle have proven to be extremely affectionate in public.\n\n\"It is very clear that William and Kate are emotionally close, however, they do not seem to feel the need to prove their love \u2013 particularly when on official state business,\" Robin Kermode, a body language expert, told The Daily Mail. \"They come across as a strong, independent couple and while they are always on show, they do not feel the need to 'show' their love for each other to the world.\"\n\nPocket problem\n\nIs Markle getting \"too casual\" for a royal?

The stunning outfit drew praise from fans, but royal experts were critical of the relaxed look.\n\n\"There is good casual and there is bad casual. Placing a hand in the pocket is too relaxed and unprofessional, however dressed down Harry and his wife may have been,\" Hanson told The Daily Mail.\n\nBut some royal fans \u2013 particularly women \u2013 argued Hanson's critique may be too harsh and praised the duchess' bold fashion choice.\n\nGoing barefoot\n\nThe royal couple kicked off their shoes in the sand during a visit to Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, last month. The move is very uncommon for royals.\n\nThe pair met with a local surfing community group, known as OneWave, a mental health awareness group, during their trip. The royals and members of the group formed a circle on the beach and shared their various experiences.\n\nDuring that time, Markle apparently opened up about her pregnancy.\n\n\"Meghan told me that pregnancy was like having jet lag. She said she was up at 4.30am this morning doing yoga in her room as she couldn\u2019t sleep,\" one woman told a Daily Mail reporter.\n\nMarkle was also wearing red toenail polish, which is believed to be \"vulgar,\" according to royal standards, Express reports.

Don\u2019t you worry about that,\" Harry was captured on video telling the boy. Afterward, Prince Harry agreed to pose for a picture with Nante.\n\nThat's not the first time Harry has impulsively broken tradition.\n\nIn early October, the royal kissed an elderly woman on the hand in Sussex, England, after she commented on how beautiful his bride was.\n\n\u201cVery nice to meet you,\u201d he told the blushing fan, according to Entertainment Tonight.\n\nSetting the date\n\nHarry and Markle set a May 19 date for their wedding, which took place at St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle. The date fell on a Saturday \u2014 an unusual move, considering most British royal weddings take place on a weekday.\n\nAgain, there's no official rule, but royal pairs typically schedule weddings on Fridays \u2014 thus, allowing England to declare the day a national bank holiday to ensure locals can catch the action, according to Marie Claire.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE AND PRINCE HARRY'S ROYAL WEDDING: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nPrince William and Middleton stuck to tradition with their April 29, 2011 wedding, which fell on a Friday.\n\n\"We want to mark the day as one of national celebration, a public holiday will ensure the most people possible will have a chance to celebrate on the day,\" then Prime Minister David Cameron announced at the time, per The Telegraph.\n\nHoliday season\n\nRoughly a month after her engagement to Harry, Markle joined the royal family to celebrate Christmas. In fact, that's when she was officially welcomed into the family by Queen Elizabeth.\n\nMarkle joining the royal family during Christmas (her first public outing with the family) was unusual because new members are usually invited to holiday events only after they are married, according to The Telegraph.

Journalism is not a crime,\" Jackson said.", "New Caledonia, a French archipelago in the South Pacific, is preparing for an independence referendum \u2014 the last step in a three-decades-long decolonization effort.\n\nSunday's vote is key to settling tensions between the native Kanaks, who once suffered from strict segregation policies, and descendants of European colonizers. It is also a test of the depth of the links between France and the territory, which lies east of Australia and has about 270,000 inhabitants.\n\nVoters have to answer the question \"Do you want New Caledonia to gain full sovereignty and become independent?\" Observers say that, based on past electoral results and polls, voters are likely to back remaining in France.\n\nThe territory enjoys a large degree of autonomy, but relies on the French state for its defense, police, foreign affairs, justice and education.\n\nThe referendum is the result of a process that started 30 years ago after years of violence that pitched pro-independence Kanak activists against those willing to remain in France.\n\nIn 1988, 19 Kanak tribesmen died after they took French police hostage in a cave on the New Caledonian island of Ouvea. Four soldiers were also killed.\n\nThe violence represented a \"tremendous shock\" and a \"key moment\" for France, French historian Isabelle Merle said. \"This is the first time a carefully thought-through peaceful decolonization process has been considered,\" she said.\n\nThe Ouvea events prompted a peace deal that year between rival loyalist and pro-independence factions that laid the ground for the referendum.\n\nVisiting the territory in May, French President Emmanuel Macron acknowledged the \"pain of colonization\" and paid tribute to the courage of those involved in the peace process.\n\nHe also handed the Caledonian government a document that stated the archipelago became a French possession in 1853 \u2014 a gesture intended to symbolize the final chapter in the period of colonization.\n\n\"We are no longer in a time of possession, but a time of choice\", he said.\n\nUnder French colonial rule, the Kanaks were forced to live on reserves in remote areas, pay specific taxes and do mandatory work for very low wages. They had to respect curfews and were not allowed into some places reserved for European settlers.\n\nMerle, whose researches focus on France's decolonization process, said this led to \"a big gap between the local communities.\"\n\n\"In the whole French colonial emprise, the Kanaks have probably been those who have been despised the most, in the sense that they were seen as savages,\" she said.\n\nToday the Kanaks represent about 40 percent of New Caledonia's population, while people of European descent make up about 27 percent. Others include those who emigrated from Asia and other Pacific islands.\n\nLong used as a prison colony, New Caledonia remains an important part of France's overseas holdings that stretch from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean and the northeast coast of Canada.\n\nTogether, they enable France to lay claim to the world's second largest maritime domain \u2014 the area within 200 nautical miles from the coast in which each country is sovereign and can exploit natural resources \u2014 almost equivalent to that of the United States.\n\nNew Caledonia's turquoise lagoons are a tourism magnet, and its mines contain a quarter of the world's known nickel supplies, a metal used in electronics manufacturing and many other industries.\n\nBut like other French overseas territories, the territory suffers from much higher unemployment and poverty than in the mainland, and many residents share a feeling of being neglected by Paris.\n\nFrench overseas economies are largely dependent on the French state. France's global budget for overseas amounts to 17 billion euros ($19,3 billion) this year, including 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) for New Caledonia, according to a Senate report.\n\nOnce the second largest colonial empire in the world after Britain, French power had extended to west and north Africa, southeast Asia and islands in the Caribbean, Indian and Pacific Ocean, reaching its height between the World Wars. In 1939, five percent of the world's population was living under French rule.\n\nMost of France's African and Asian colonies broke free in the 1950s and 1960s. The vote in New Caledonia is the first time a self-determination referendum is being held on a French territory since Djibouti, in the Horn of Africa, voted for independence in 1977.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Edouard Philippe will travel to New Caledonia the day after the vote to discuss the archipelago's future with local politicians.\n\nWhatever the referendum's result, Merle said pro-independence Kanaks will keep pushing for New Caledonia to be its own country.", "A commercial fisherman jumped on a humpback whale off the Central California coast to free it from being entangled in a rope, reports said this week, citing a video capturing the event in September.\n\nA rope was wrapped around the whale\u2019s back and tail when Sam Synstelien jumped onto the mammal off Morro Bay, NBC Bay Area reported.\n\n\"(The whale) was just swimming in counter-clockwise circles,\" Nicholas Taron, the person who shot the video, told the station. \"You could tell he was stressed and being held to the bottom.\"\n\nThe crew initially reported the problem to the Coast Guard, who \u201ckind of finally said there\u2019s nothing else you can do,\u201d Taron said.

In addition, every entangled whale is not necessarily in imminent danger, meaning that there is time to wait for the authorized responders and not requiring these types of emergency actions,\u201d the agency said. \u201cAnd cutting just the visible lines may not totally free the animal, making it harder for responders to help.\"\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Pacific Fisheries said the happy ending could\u2019ve turned out much worse for the crew, according to NBC Bay Area.\n\n\"We\u2019ve had people die trying to get in the water, and just last year, we lost one of our responders,\" spokesman Justin Veizbicke said. \u201cEven though it seems like it\u2019s a very stressful situation, we usually have days, weeks, sometimes even months to find these animals and get this gear off.\u201d", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nThe release of a Christian woman in Pakistan who was acquitted eight years after being sentenced to death for blasphemy was apparently delayed Friday, after talks failed between the government and radical Islamists who want her publicly hanged.\n\nAlso, a lawyer representing a local cleric who had raised the initial blasphemy charges against Asia Bibi petitioned the Supreme Court on Thursday to reverse its acquittal.\n\nThe top court in a landmark decision on Wednesday overturned Bibi's 2010 conviction of insulting Islam's Prophet Muhammad.\n\nSince then, Islamists have blocked highways and damaged or set-fire to dozens of vehicles to pressure the government to stop her release from an undisclosed detention facility.\n\nIslamists were to hold nationwide rallies after Friday's prayers, stoking fears violence. Pakistan shut down schools and colleges after radical cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi, the leader of Tehreek-e-Labbaik party, announced that \"talks\" between his deputies and the government about Bibi's fate had failed.\n\nBefore dawn Friday, Rizvi told an emotionally-charged rally in the eastern city of Lahore that one of the government negotiators threatened his deputies during the talks that security forces will ruthlessly kill them if they did not disperse peacefully. He asked his supporters to continue sit-ins as authorities summoned paramilitary troops to restore order.\n\n\"We are ready to die to show our love for the prophet,\" he said.\n\nRizvi's envoys had demanded that Bibi be barred from leaving the country but Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry rejected the demand, saying the government will not accept any dictates.\n\nGhulam Mustafa, a lawyer representing a provincial cleric in Punjab who had filed the initial blasphemy charges against Bibi, petitioned the Supreme Court, requesting the judges review her acquittal. The court has set not dates to take up the petition, but Bibi's release could be further delayed by the process. Pakistan's Supreme Court has not been known to reverse its decisions but court reviews typically take years.\n\nAuthorities say they have stepped up security near an undisclosed detention facility where Bibi is being held for her safety. On Thursday, prison officials said two inmates were arrested last month for planning to kill Bibi by strangling her. They said the men were still being questioned.\n\nBibi's family had expected her release by Thursday night. Her husband, Ashiq Masih, returned from Britain with their children in mid-October and was waiting for her release so that they can fly out of Pakistan. Though the family has not disclosed the country of her destination, France and Spain have offered asylum.\n\nBibi's acquittal has posed a challenge to the government of Pakistan's new Prime Minister Imran Khan, who came to power this summer partly by pursuing the Islamist agenda.\n\nKhan condemned the Islamists on Wednesday after cleric Afzal Qadri urged supporters to kill the three judges who acquitted Bibi, revolt against army chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa and overthrow Khan's government.\n\nMilitary's spokesman Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor said Friday the army was exercising restraint, to give a chance for a peaceful resolution. He asked demonstrators to refrain from violence and await the outcome of the review petition to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Let this legal process be completed first,\" he told state-run Pakistan Television.\n\nHowever, over 2,000 Islamists continued blocking a key road linking the capital, Islamabad, with the garrison city of Rawalpindi on Friday, causing traffic jams. Hundreds also blocked another key motorway, linking Islamabad with other major cities.\n\nBibi was arrested in 2009 after she was accused of blasphemy following a quarrel with two fellow female farm workers who refused to drink from a water container used by a Christian. A few days later, a mob accused her of insulting Islam's prophet, leading to her 2010 conviction.\n\nBibi's family has always maintained her innocence and says she never insulted the prophet.\n\nBibi's case has drawn international attention and also put Pakistan's controversial blasphemy laws into focus again. The charge of blasphemy carried the death penalty in this majority Muslim nation and critics say it is often used to settle feuds and arguments.\n\n___\n\nTanveer reported from Multan, Pakistan.", "Voters in Harris County, Texas, have come out in force during this year's early voting period, surpassing voter turnout for the entire 2014 midterm election season and positioning the county to possibly see 1 million voters for the first time in a midterm election.\n\nBy the end of Thursday, the Harris County Clerk\u2019s Office reported 64,343 ballots had been cast, with another 3,656 arriving by mail, bringing the total to 755,877, the Houston Chronicle reported.

First, historic norms favor the party opposed to the President by a lot in House contests. The President's party loses an average of 29 House seats in most midterms. Second, the sheer number of open seats which House Republicans must defend this fall is off the chart. More than 40 Republican seats are wide open.\n\nThird, dismiss the old midterm standards. We operate now in the age of President Trump. Mr. Trump rode an inside straight to the White House two years ago. The rules have changed. Most midterm elections are a referendum on the first two years of a new president. Study what happened to President Clinton in 1994 and President Obama in 2010. Voters repudiated both chief executives with historic pickups, flipping control of the House. It's unknown if supporters of President Trump show up just to cast a ballot for someone not named President Trump.\n\nAnd four, control of the House could be close.

Australian police did not immediately comment Friday on any potential Australian criminal link to the shooting.\n\nMacris, who was married to a model who appeared on a Greek reality TV show, was shot as he left his home in Voula in his car on Wednesday evening. Police say he apparently left his car to take cover but was shot four times with a 9 mm handgun and died at the scene.\n\nPolice were seeking camera footage for clues to the killing and were conducting ballistics tests on the bullet casings to determine whether the weapon had been used in other crimes.\n\nMacris had been involved in Sydney's organized crime scene.

As Pelosi eyes reclaiming the speakership if her party takes power, numerous ranking members are lining up for influential jobs below her.\n\nTRUMP MAY TAKE PELOSI SUBPOENA THREAT TO SUPREME COURT\n\nMaxine Waters - Financial Services Committee\n\nRep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. -- who has repeatedly called for Trump's impeachment and whom, in turn, Trump has called a \"low-IQ individual\" -- is one of the best-known Democrats who could soon wield the power of the committee gavel, and with it, the potential to subpoena and control the fate of legislation before it comes to a floor vote.\n\nIf Democrats retake the lower chamber, Waters, 80, would likely be elevated to chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, where she currently serves as ranking member. The committee oversees the housing, banking, insurance, and securities industries, and in the past year, Waters has offered some clues about her regulatory agenda.\n\nLast August, Waters moved unsuccessfully to subpoena Deutsche Bank AG for records concerning \"internal reviews of the personal accounts of the President and his family,\" as well as more information about fees levied against the bank concerning lax money-laundering detection policies that could have allowed Russian operatives to funnel cash without a paper trail.\n\nAnd in May, Waters opposed a contested bill, which was ultimately backed by several other blue-state Democrats and signed into law by Trump, that rolled back some 2010 Obama-era Dodd-Frank regulations on virtually all of the nation's banks. (The 2010 legislation also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is facing a potential Supreme Court challenge for affording its director unilateral czar-like authorities; Trump has dulled the CFPB's influence, and now-Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh has previously ruled that the CFPB's structure is unconstitutional.)\n\nThe rollback of the Dodd-Frank package was supported by Hillary Clinton's former running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., as well as another Virginia Democrat, Mark Warner, who sponsored the 2010 legislation.\n\nWATERS ENCOURAGES SUPPORTERS TO 'PUSH BACK' ON TRUMP STAFFERS IN PUBLIC, SAYS PEOPLE WILL 'ABSOLUTELY HARASS' THEM\n\nWaters' aggressive tack appears to have alarmed the financial industry. According to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, corporations, individuals, and affiliated entities within the securities and investment industry have spent more than $56.8 million to support Democratic candidates for Congress this election cycle, compared to only $33.4 million for Republicans. But a large portion of that money was going to moderate Democrats, not more left-leaning firebrands like Waters -- a sign that the industry may feel a Democratic takeover of the House is inevitable, and that supporting more temperate liberal candidates might be the safest bet.\n\nLIZ PEEK: DEM HOUSE TAKEOVER WOULD ONLY DEEPEN PARTISAN DIVIDE, WITH 'JUST WIN, BABY' ATTITUDE\n\nOn Wednesday, Fox Business Network's Charles Gasparino exclusively reported that people close to Waters say she would have a \"constructive relationship\" with banks and would prioritize her focus instead on the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is currently run by Ben Carson.\n\nAdam Schiff - Intelligence Committee\n\nAnother top California Democratic representative, Adam Schiff, would likely rise to chair the House Intelligence Committee, where he is now the ranking member.\n\nSchiff, 58, said in an interview with CNN last week that Russia-related matters would be front-and-center as soon as he became the committee's helmsman. In particular, he has suggested he would parallel Waters' focus on potential money-laundering schemes involving the Trump team and Russia, because he said he was unsure whether Special Counsel Robert Mueller had the legal mandate to pursue those leads.\n\n\"The question, though, that I don't know whether Mueller has been able to answer -- because I don't know whether he's been given the license to look into it -- is were the Russians laundering money through the Trump Organization?\" Schiff said. \"And that will be a very high priority to get an answer to -- for the reason that, if they were doing this, it's not only a crime, but it's something provable.\"\n\nMueller is authorized to probe \"any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated\" with Trump's team, as well as \"any matters that arose or may arise directly\" during the investigation.\n\n\"We will be able to get answers the Republicans were unwilling to pursue -- records that the Republicans wouldn't ask for,\" Schiff added.\n\nIn April, Republicans on the Intelligence Committee said they had found \u201cno evidence\u201d of any unlawful collusion between the Russian government and Trump campaign, and in September, the committee voted unanimously to release transcripts from that investigation.\n\nThere are indications Schiff wouldn't hesitate to push aggressively for more testimony and documents. In a tense closed-door session earlier this year, Schiff demanded contempt charges against former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon after he repeatedly asserted executive privilege and refused to answer questions related to the administration's interactions with Russia.\n\nFORMER TRUMP AIDE CARTER PAGE SUES DNC FOR DEFAMATION AFTER HE'S ACCUSED OF RUSSIA TIES\n\nJerry Nadler - Judiciary Committee\n\nSchiff would be aided by New York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, who is currently the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee -- the committee that would oversee any attempt to impeach Trump.\n\nThe 71-year-old congressman was on the Judiciary Committee when it voted to impeach former President Bill Clinton, which Nadler said at the time was tantamount to an attempted coup and a gross abuse of the impeachment power. In September, Nadler said at a forum that \"impeachment should not be partisan,\" and he insisted that even some criminal offenses would not merit impeachment unless they implicate the institutions of government.\n\n\"If the president perjured himself about colluding with Russians, that would be worthy of impeachment,\" Nadler said. \"Perjury about some real estate deal that happened 10 years ago that the Trump Organization took, that would not be an impeachable offense. It would be a crime.\"\n\nNadler has made Trump's immigration policies one of his foremost priorities this year, especially in the wake of the administration's zero-tolerance policy on prosecuting illegal immigrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. That policy led to the separations of some children from their parents, causing an intense public backlash that prompted Trump to issue an executive order to end the separations.\n\nNadler would have the authority as Judiciary Committee chairman to demand documents related to that episode, as well as the administration's crackdown on what it has called fraudulent asylum claims. Nadler was one of seven Democratic lawmakers who gained entry to an immigration detention center in New Jersey this summer after \"arguing\" with the police and \"literally banging on the door,\" one of the congressmen posted on Twitter.\n\nAt one point, Nadler declared that he was apparently making forcible entry to the facility: \"We have gotten the door open at the Elizabeth, NJ ICE detention center and refusing to let it close until we are given access to the detainees,\" he tweeted.\n\nSeparately, Nadler has vowed that the Judiciary Committee would take a closer look at the Senate testimony of Kavanaugh. Then a nominee to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh strenuously denied sexually assaulting anyone, and he insisted that he had never gotten so drunk that he had blacked out.\n\nLawmakers \"would have to investigate any credible allegations ... of perjury and other things that haven\u2019t been properly looked into before,\" Nadler told ABC News last month.\n\nElijah Cummings - Oversight Committee\n\nAnother key Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., is poised to become chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which has sweeping investigative jurisdiction and is considered one of the most influential committees in all of Congress. As chairman, Cummings would effectively have unilateral authority to issue subpoenas.\n\nHe has promised to probe how former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Scott Pruitt kept his job for months despite mounting ethics scandals, as well as whether and how Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner used a private email account to conduct official government business.\n\nCummings has also called for investigations into Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai, and is expected to doggedly pursue former Trump officials like fired National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, who has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s cut through the unnecessary BS and let\u2019s get to the facts \u2014 and I do not want anybody wasting my time,\" Cummings told Politico in October. \"Nor do I want to waste the time of my committee members or my family members. And I damn sure don\u2019t want to waste my time.\u201d\n\n\"Let\u2019s cut through the unnecessary BS and let\u2019s get to the facts.\" \u2014 Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md.\n\nBut former GOP Judiciary Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, who is now a Fox News contributor, told the magazine that Cummings shouldn't get his hopes up.\n\n\u201cIf [North Carolina Rep.] Mark Meadows and [Ohio Rep.] Jim Jordan can\u2019t get documents out of the White House, I don\u2019t know why Elijah Cummings and the Democrats think they\u2019ll do any better,\u201d Chaffetz said.\n\nAnd despite the potentially imminent shakeup of key House committees -- and dire warnings from Trump that Democrats would enact change \"quickly and violently\" if they seize power -- some conservative analysts took a more sanguine view.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think that Democrats taking over the House would change much,\" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who previously directed the Congressional Budget Office and now serves as president of a conservative think tank, told Fox News. \"The only legislative initiative that appears to be at stake is tax reform 2.0.

He said he did not have specifics on Bulger's behavior in Florida, and did not know why Bulger was specifically sent to Hazelton.\n\nBulger, who ran a largely Irish mob in Boston in the 1970s and '80s, ratted on his rivals, the New England Mob, to the FBI while simultaneously running his own crime ring responsible for loansharking, extortion and a string of murders.\n\nBulger fled Boston in late 1994 after being tipped off by his FBI handler that he was about to be indicted. He spent the next 16 years as one of America's most wanted fugitives until he was found in 2011, living with his girlfriend in a rent-controlled apartment in Santa Monica, California.\n\nA Mafia hit man, Fotios \"Freddy\" Geas, who is said to hate \"rats,\" and at least one other inmate are believed to have been involved in Bulger's killing , an ex-investigator briefed on the case said Wednesday.

Add Bulger's notoriety, and Hood said he could not imagine housing him with other inmates.\n\n\"A known snitch in almost every prison is in jeopardy,\" Hood said. \"I don't think it was intentional. I just think they gave too much credit to the age of the inmate, thinking: 'He's old, he's not going to hurt anyone,'\" he said.\n\nBulger's killing marks the third at Hazelton in the last six months.\n\nLast week, five members of Congress wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions about what they called \"dangerous continual understaffing\" at federal prisons in West Virginia and Pennsylvania and stated their alarm about the deaths at USP Hazelton.\n\nJustice Department spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle said DOJ was \"aware of the concerns raised in the letter\" and would respond to the members of Congress.\n\n___\n\nLavoie reported from Richmond, Virginia.", "", "The leader of Dar es Salaam, the most populated city in Tanzania, is ordering mass arrests of homosexuals living in the region.\n\nRegional Commissioner Paul Makonda said Tuesday that he's ordered a surveillance squad to monitor gay and lesbian people in the city, which has a population of more than 4 million.\n\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION MULLS ROLLBACK OF OBAMA-ERA TRANSGENDER PROTECTIONS, REPORT SAYS\n\nThe 17-member squad will use social media to identify and ultimately arrest gay, lesbian or transgender people, Reuters reported.\n\nMakonda tweeted that he's received the names of more than 100 suspected gay people in Dar es Salaam from the public, and warned that he plans to take action.\n\nGay sex is illegal in Tanzania, and is \"punishable by long prison sentences,\" according to the State Department.

Early buzz - and the choice of venue - suggested a big announcement involving Apple Music or iTunes, but the day was all about devices.

That number has declined somewhat as the group's size diminishes, but kids of all ages are still everywhere and at risk of illness, dehydration and other dangers.\n\nAnd if it's exhausting for children, it's perhaps even more so for their parents trying to care for them as they walk long hours in the sun, sleep on the ground outdoors and rely on donations of food and clothing to get by.\n\nPamela Valle, a 28-year-old from El Progreso, Honduras, said no child should have to undertake a migration like this. But unable to find work back home, she said she had no choice but to leave and take 5-year-old Eleonor with her.\n\nEach day when they arrive in a new town on the long trek across the steamy southern Mexico countryside, she looks first for a sheltered place to sleep. On this day that was a red tarp that a group of migrants stretched across a playground in the main square of the southern town of Tapanetepec. Then she and Eleonor went in search of food and bathrooms.\n\n\"I don't think you can prepare children psychologically, but we have to in some way make it like a game, like telling them it's a vacation,\" Valle said, adding that it has been hard on Eleonor. \"It's not right, but sometimes the situation obliges you.\"\n\nWith Tuesday's U.S. midterm elections just days away, President Donald Trump has continued to ramp up his rhetoric against the caravan of some 4,000 migrants, repeatedly hammering Democrats and talking of sending as many as 15,000 U.S. troops to the southern border \u2014 more than double the number of migrants in this group and three other much smaller ones following in its footsteps hundreds of miles behind.\n\nIn a lengthy speech on Thursday, Trump promised an executive order next week that would automatically deny asylum to migrants who try to enter the United States illegally between ports of entry. U.S. immigration laws currently allow migrants to seek asylum no matter how they arrive in the U.S.\n\nUnless they unexpectedly find some way of traveling faster \u2014 and Mexican officials have shown no inclination to facilitate that \u2014 they are still weeks away from reaching the U.S. border. Thousands have already dropped out, applying for asylum in Mexico or accepting free bus rides home, and many more are expected to do the same. A caravan earlier this year fizzled to just about 200 who actually made it to the Tijuana-San Diego border.\n\nAfter failing to persuade Mexican authorities to provide buses that would have whisked them hundreds of miles ahead to Mexico City, the migrants were on the move again on foot Thursday, hitchhiking and scrounging rides when they could find them.\n\nTheir goal for the day was to trek 40 miles (65 kilometers) to reach the town of Matias Romero in Oaxaca state, still more than 840 miles (1,350 kilometers) to the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas.\n\nFor families the long trek has imposed a particularly grueling routine that has taken a toll after more than two weeks.\n\nThe migrants rise by 3 a.m. each day to take advantage of cooler temperatures. Parents try to feed kids who are awake while letting those small enough to carry or put in a stroller sleep. Since the group usually camps in town squares and most include some sort of playground, children run around the monkey bars in the dark while their parents pack.\n\nOn a recent day, one woman walked with a length of black cord tied to the wrists of her daughter and another girl so she wouldn't lose them. A toddler leaned against his older sister, playing with a tiny plastic truck on the edge of the highway, while their mother tried to flag down a passing truck.\n\nStill, as young children do, many found ways to lighten the difficult journey with imaginary play.\n\nAfter arriving in Tapanatepec's main plaza, Evelin Flores, a spunky 7-year-old from Tela, Honduras, set to playing her favorite game of \"stylist,\" combing everyone's hair as she loves to do back home. Flores said she sings the traditional Spanish folksong \"La Cucaracha,\" to while away the hours on the road.\n\n\"It's only that it's really tiresome to walk,\" she said.\n\nStanding on the steps of the town's church, 4-year-old Madelin held a small bible and pretended to preach with Pentecostal fervor, waving her arms and stomping back and forth. Suddenly she grabbed a medicine bottle and, holding it like a microphone, let out a scream.\n\n\"She's very dramatic,\" her mother Mileybi Ramos said, laughing at her daughter's antics.\n\nUnder a sheet of black plastic stretched taut with rocks to weigh it down, 4-year-old Eipril Arguijo Gonzalez flopped onto her 17-year-old brother's bare chest, giggled uncontrollably when he grabbed her and then popped back up to resume pacing around her small space on a church patio where her family was spending the night in the town of Niltepec.\n\n\"She acts like we're on vacation,\" said her brother, Jonny. His twin, Jordy, chimed in that in each town where they've stopped, Eipril calls the river the beach.\n\nFor the Arguijo family, the trip has been hardest on 10-year-old Keneth, who is too old to be carried or pushed in a stroller and knows too much to think this is any kind of vacation. After covering dozens of miles on foot, both of Keneth's feet were shredded with cuts and blisters and he went to a medical tent to have them bandaged.\n\nDespite his tender age, he was part of the family meeting in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, when the family decided to flee.\n\nJonny and Jordy had left with their father in August because the gang controlling their neighborhood was trying to force them to sell drugs. They made it as far as the town of Tenosique in Mexico's Tabasco state, not far from the Guatemalan border. But the gang was threatening their other siblings and mother back home, so they returned for them.\n\n\"Since they were looking for us to sell drugs, they went looking to beat Keneth up,\" Jordy said.\n\nIf they make it to the United States, the twins hope to return to school. The brothers were a year away from finishing high school when their parents pulled them out for safety reasons.\n\n\"First we're going to have to find a place to stay,\" Jordy said. \"Afterward we'll make a little money to buy a house and live normally with our family.\"", "", "On the heels of explosive revelations that Iranian operatives \u2013 allegedly under direct orders from Tehran \u2013 plotted to carry out deadly attacks on dissidents across Europe, U.S. intelligence is on heightened alert of similar Iran-orchestrated operations, according to several analysts and insiders.\n\n\u201cGiven recent geopolitical developments, there is a growing concern of Iran orchestrating assignations and potential attacks,\u201d said Michael Rozin, president of Minneapolis-based threat detection firm Rozin Security, and a former Israeli security agent, told Fox News. \u201cIranian intelligence services typically leverage local residents or citizens for pre-operational activities and use their own trained operatives ... They leverage local sympathizers or those with families in Iran.\u201d\n\nIn August, the Department of Justice arrested two Iranians suspected of spying and \u201cacting on behalf of the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran by conducting covert surveillance of Israeli and Jewish facilities in the United States, and collecting identifying information about American citizens and U.S. nationals.\u201d In particular, the Iranians targeted those involved with the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK) \u2013 also referred to as the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI).\n\nThe MEK has long been deemed a terrorist organization by Tehran. It was also designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department in 1997, but was removed from the list in 2012. Eight years earlier, then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld designated the group as civilian \"protected persons\" under the Geneva Convention.\n\nOne man identified as Ahmadreza Mohammadi Doostdar was a dual national with U.S. and Iranian citizenship, accused of conducting illicit snooping on a Jewish organization in Chicago. The other, Majid Ghorbani, is an Iranian citizen and California permanent resident, who was arrested after allegedly taking photos at an Iranian opposition rally held in New York, in September 2017 and passing them on to Iranian intelligence.\n\nThe indictment against Ghorbani says he was involved in an operation to kidnap and kill Ali Safavi, a leading Iranian opposition figure. \u201cI remember him. He came to the rally and upon seeing me, asked why I don\u2019t go to California to visit anymore,\u201d Safavi, a senior official with the NCRI, told Fox News.\n\nSafavi says Ghorbani was a waiter at a southern California restaurant he frequented, which is where they first met several years ago, and he enthusiastically joined in on conversations regarding condemnation of the Iranian regime.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this was part of something bigger,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think authorities have gotten to the bottom of this \u2013 more information of a network could most certainly come to light.\u201d\n\nDoostdar is alleged to have gone to Iran himself, and made contact with Ghorbani later in the Los Angeles area, paying some $2,000 in cash to take photographs at the MEK New York event.\n\nThe two men were under FBI watch for a lengthy period of time. An attorney for the men have called the government\u2019s case \u201cpreposterous,\u201d and said suggestions his client \u201chad an axe to grind with members of the Jewish faith is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nMany other U.S. intelligence experts and analysts beg to differ. Under increasing pressure from the Trump administration, concerns are growing that these arrests are only the beginning, amid more questions whether there is a wider underground network at play, intent on silencing critics.\n\nOne former CIA operative still entrenched in Middle East intelligence work told Fox News that Iran remains \u201cone of our top national security concerns and challenges,\u201d and said the intelligence community has become increasingly \u201cengaged with the Iranian threat,\u201d both in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe full slate of U.S.-imposed Iranian sanctions will kick in on Monday, and analysts are anticipating some pushback from Tehran and their supporters in the West.\n\n\u201cIt is a good bet Iran will do something to lash out in response to the sanctions. It could be targeted against U.S. allies in the Gulf region, or against U.S. targets and interests in Europe,\u201d one source conjectured. \u201cWhatever they do, they will try to keep their fingerprints off of it.\u201d\n\nJames Phillips, a senior research fellow for Middle Eastern affairs at the Heritage Foundation, said the Iranian activity is hardly new \u2013 and pointed out that during the 1980s, Iran relied at least partly on Hezbollah surrogates to strike at targets in European countries, particularly in France, that Iran deemed to be supporting Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war.\n\n\u201cIran has a long history of terrorism and assassinations of exiled opposition leaders on European soil. For targeted assassinations, it has relied on its Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps,\u201d he said. \u201cThe IRGC\u2019s Quds Force was implicated in the foiled 2011 plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington.\u201d\n\nGen. Qasem Soleimani, chief of the elite Quds Force of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard, is said to be helming a broad espionage web not only across Europe; but globally. Israel intelligence sources told Fox News they have between 10,000-15,000 recruits on foreign terrain.\n\n\u201cThe IRGC Quds Force, which organizes and carries out many of these operations, even has a special directorate for operations against the US and other Western countries,\u201d said Jonathan Ruhe, Associate Director of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA) Gemunder Center for Defense & Strategy.\n\nRuhe asserted such operations \u201ctraditionally have focused on terrorist bombings, assassinations, and kidnappings of Westerners.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Congress heard testimony from a panel of experts of former U.S. officials about Iran's \"sleeper cell\" networks in America. But another key U.S. intelligence insider told Fox News that attention on Iranian activities isn\u2019t hugely elevated, mostly due to the extremely harsh stance the Trump administration has taken on Iran - which has prompted them to somewhat back down.\n\n\u201cThere is still traditional espionage, but physical attacks aren\u2019t on the menu,\u201d the source stated. \u201cThe state-sponsored elements are certainly cognizant of our midterm elections as well. They know any attack is going to give the president and the hardliners an excuse to bomb them to the Stone Age.\u201d\n\nAccording to an Israeli intelligence insider, Israel has come to perfect the ins and outs of understanding Iran\u2019s espionage activities. Israel picks up on what Iran is planning in Europe, and passes that information on to relevant authorities.\n\nThe source noted that Iran typically recruits dual citizens already living abroad \u2013 and will either bring them to Tehran under the guise of visiting family. There they receive formal training, as agents, or are alternatively paid them for small missions like photographing targets and tracking in western nations without officially designating them operatives.\n\nRUDY GIULIANI SUGGESTS IRAN TERROR ATTACKS WERE 'INTERNAL,' LAYS OUT TERMS FOR A 'NEW' IRAN DEAL\n\nOperating on information given to them by Israeli intelligence, European security services on June 30 were able to stop an Iranian native and diplomat, Amir Saadouni \u2013 potentially saving the lives of many.\n\nSaadouni and his wife, Nasimeh Naami, based in Brussels, were on their way to a conference near Paris \u2013 a potent explosive nestled her bag \u2013 with the alleged intention of detonating the device at a rally attended by thousands of anti-regime activists belonging to the MEK. The event was also attended by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and former New York City mayor, Rudy Giuliani, who has long been a vocal champion of the organization.\n\nSaadouni has for years said to have been acting as a secret agent and for years reporting back to an Iranian intelligence leader operating under the alias Daniel, but later identified as Assadollah Assadi. According to the Wall Street Journal, Saadouni had been living in Europe for around ten years, having been granted political asylum given his association with the MEK, before becoming an EU citizen.\n\nThose who knew him told Fox News Saadouni was never a member of MEK, but portrayed himself to be a \u201csympathizer.\u201d He otherwise fit in with the European lifestyle \u2013 listening to Pink Floyd, attending occasional meetings and protests, but never infiltrating the inner circle of MEK and supporting from a distance \u2013 thus never suspected of nefarious double dealings.\n\nWHY I LEFT ISIS: FORMER BAGHDADI 'FRIEND' AND AIDE, OTHERS SPEAK OUT\n\nBut at least for the last few years, any real allegiance he may have once had for the group had been flipped. Saadouni around 2014 was reportedly approached by \u201cDaniel,\" and had instead functioned as a mole to dish back information in exchange for \u201cbags of cash.\u201d\n\nAssadi now stands accused of being a covert chiefdom in Iran\u2019s Intelligence Ministry, using the cover of being a diplomat at the Iranian Embassy in Vienna, Austria. The Israeli tip had enabled authorities to keep the diplomat under surveillance for some time. Had he remained there, he would have received immunity from prosecution. But a venture over the border to Luxembourg gave German police the path to move in and make an arrest.\n\nFrench police last month arrested 11 people and froze the financial assets of the headquarters of a Shiite Muslim center after conducting a \u201cprevention of terrorism\u201d raid, raising questions of the center\u2019s direct links to Tehran. Police raids also took place on homes and offices of possible Iranian agents in Germany in January.\n\nThis week, Denmark police also announced they, too, had thwarted an Iranian scheme in September to murder a political contrarian belonging to an Arab separatist movement, ASMLA, which champions an independent Arab state in Iranian. An arrest of an Iranian suspect and possible spy was made two weeks ago.\n\nIn June, two Iranian diplomats were expelled from the Netherlands after an opposition Iranian activist was gunned down, and Albanian authorities in March arrested two Iranian officials for allegedly undertaking surveillance on MEK exiles during their Nowruz (New Year) festivities.\n\nIran\u2019s Foreign Ministry has vehemently denied involvement in all aforementioned schemes.\n\nYet the notion that Iranian-orchestrated attacks were devised on European turf has had a detrimental impact on the European support for the JCPOA, better known as the Iran Deal. The controversial agreement, of which the U.S. pulled out earlier this year, still enjoyed prominent support from EU governments who tried desperately to salvage it.

Israel is a sovereign state and we shall duly respect that.\"\n\nIt was the first time since being elected Sunday that Bolsonaro referred to his plan to move the embassy.\n\nIn Israel, Netanyahu issued a statement praising Bolsonaro. \"I congratulate my friend Brazilian President-Elect, Jair Bolsonaro, for his intention to move the Brazilian Embassy to Jerusalem, a historic, correct and exciting step!\"\n\nNetanyahu spoke to Bolsonaro earlier this week, congratulating him on his victory and inviting him to visit Israel.\n\nIf Bolsonaro follows through on his pledge, Brazil would become the third country to have an embassy in Jerusalem, after the U.S. and Guatemala.

But in recent weeks, the sea animal \u2014 formally known as an Octopus vulgaris \u2014 spent more time hiding in a rock cave inside her tank, the Savannah Morning News reported.\n\nEarly last week, officials finally figured out why: Octavius was pregnant and eventually laid her eggs, which hatched into \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of baby octopuses, according to the newspaper.\n\n\u201cI noticed this cloud of moving dots and I realized, \u2018Oh my God, she had babies.

When the female is ready, it will \"become restless and search for a sheltered place where they can lay and brood the eggs without disturbance,\" the University of Michigan's Museum of Zoology explains online.\n\n\"Fertilization takes place in the oviductal glands as the mature eggs pass through them on their way out of the oviducts,\" the museum continued, adding these creatures can lay up to 500,000 eggs.\n\nOctavius was likely pregnant when she came to the aquarium from the South Carolina Aquarium in Charleston in August, according to the newspaper, though officials weren\u2019t aware of this at the time.\n\nThe Savannah Morning News reported some of the babies \u2014 which are hard to see without a microscope \u2014 were released into the nearby Skidaway River while others are being kept in nursery tanks at the aquarium, which is a part of the university's Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant.\n\nSadly, Octavius will likely die now that she\u2019s laid the eggs and they've hatched.\n\n\u201cThe mother will protect the eggs in her den and waft or aerate or fluff them.

Asylum claims made by migrants caught crossing the border illegally would seemingly be summarily denied under Trump's proposal.\n\nThe asylum clause of the Immigration and Nationality Act says that anyone who arrives to the U.S. may apply for asylum based on a well-founded fear of persecution, and Trump's decision was likely to prompt immediate federal court challenges.\n\nIn his remarks, Trump called the thousands of migrants in the approaching caravans from Central America \"not legitimate asylum-seekers\" because most of them have not decided to remain in Mexico and pursue asylum there. \"Asylum is not a program for people living in poverty,\" he said.\n\nThe president also issued something of a warning to members of the caravan, including those who reportedly threw rocks at members of the Mexican police this week.\n\n\"We will consider that a firearm,\" Trump said. \"We will consider that the maximum we can consider that, because they're throwing rocks viciously and violently. .... We're not going to put up with that. They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. I told them to consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks, like they did at the Mexico military and police, I said, consider it a rifle.\"\n\nAsked by a reporter to clarify if U.S. troops might fire on the caravan, Trump responded, \"I hope not, I hope not -- but it's the military.\"\n\n\"They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back.\" \u2014 President Trump\n\nThe president's statement marked his latest major policy pronouncement on illegal immigration with just days to go before the Nov. 6 midterm elections, following his decision to send thousands of troops to the U.S. border and his push to end birthright citizenship, which he said could be accomplished by executive order.\n\nTrump said Thursday he would issue a \"comprehensive\" executive order next week on immigration matters, including his asylum plan.\n\n\"If these caravans are allowed into our country, only bigger and more emboldened caravans will follow -- and you see that's what's happening now,\" Trump said.\n\nSESSIONS SAYS 'VAST MAJORITY' OF ASYLUM CLAIMS ARE INVALID, ANNOUNCES NEW RULES TO CUT DOWN ON ASYLUM CLAIMS\n\nIn a statement, Omar Jadwat, the director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, condemned the president's announcement.\n\n\"If he plans at some point to prohibit people from applying for asylum between the ports of entry, that plan is illegal,\" Jadwat said. \"What is clear from the timing and vague nature of today\u2019s remarks is that he is simply trying to inflame his base in the final run-up to the midterms.\u201d\n\nTrump and other administration officials have long encouraged those seeking asylum to come through legal ports of entry. However, many migrants may be unaware of that guidance, and official border crossings have grown increasingly clogged.\n\nImmigration officials have turned away asylum-seekers at ports of entry citing overcrowding, telling them to return at a later date. Backlogs have grown especially bad in recent months at crossings in California, Arizona and Texas, with people typically waiting five weeks to claim asylum at San Diego's main crossing and sleeping out in the open for days at a time.\n\nMigrants who cross illegally are generally arrested and often seek asylum or some other form of protection. Claims have spiked since 2010, and there is currently a backlog of more than 800,000 cases pending in immigration court.\n\nDetention facilities are also nearly at their maximum capacity; Trump on Thursday said more are being constructed, and that illegal immigrants will be held in \"massive cities of tents.\"\n\nAdministration officials have railed against what they say are loopholes designed to encourage people, especially from Central America, to come to the U.S. and claim asylum. On Thursday, Trump said human trafficking -- in which \"the lowest scum on Earth ... steal children\" -- has hit unprecedented levels, in part because of lax asylum policies.\n\n\"We will not allow our generosity to be abused by those who would break our laws, defy our rules, violate our borders, break into our country illegally -- we won't allow it,\" Trump said. \"Mass uncontrolled immigration is especially unfair to the many wonderful law-abiding immigrants already living here, who followed the rules and waited their turn.\"\n\nOnce illegal immigrants apply for asylum, even if their claims are fraudulent, they previously have been allowed into the U.S. pending the adjudication of their asylum claims -- which require a credible fear of imminent persecution based on a limited number of factors, such as political or religious belief, in order to be upheld.\n\nMost asylum claims often fail to meet this high legal standard after they are reviewed by aslyum judges, and only about 20 percent of applicants are approved.\n\n\"They never show up at the trials,\" Trump said, referring to people who claim asylum and then are released into the country. \"They never come back, they're never seen again.\"\n\nASYLUM CLAIMS OVERWHELM U.S. SYSTEM -- A LOOK AT THE NUMBERS\n\nThe president also emphasized that children were separated from their parents at the border under President Obama's administration -- although those separations occured with less frequency than they did under the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy, which dramatically ramped up the criminal prosecutions for illegal border crossers that had legally necessitated the separations. Trump has since signed an executive order to keep parents and children together after they're caught illegally crossing the border.\n\nTrump's comments came hours after the leading caravan trying to make its way to the U.S. border failed in its efforts to convince the Mexican government to offer dozens of buses to speed up their journey northward.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump again characterized the caravan as an \"invasion\" that has \"overrun the Mexican police -- and hurt, badly, Mexican soldiers. ... They're wasting their time. They should turn back now.\"\n\nThe caravan initially totaled more than 7,000 people, but its numbers have dwindled as thousands have either applied for asylum in Mexico or returned to Honduras.\n\nA second, smaller group of 1,000 or so migrants is more than 200 miles back. A third band of about 500 from El Salvador has made it to Guatemala, and a fourth group of about 700 set out from the Salvadoran capital Wednesday.\n\nAt a rally Wednesday in Fort Myers, Fla., Trump charged that the leading incoming caravan represents a security threat. \"They got a lot of rough people in those caravans -- they are not angels. They are not,\" he said.\n\nTrump has said that up to 15,000 U.S. troops could be deployed to the border if the caravan continues its approach. The Pentagon noted Wednesday afternoon that its initial estimate was for 7,000 troops at the border.\n\nThe president also has sparred with some in his own party, including outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., over Trump's proposal to end birthright citizenship, which allows children of illegal immigrants to automatically become U.S. citizens if born within the country's borders.\n\n\"Illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\" Trump said to applause at Wednesday's rally, to chants of \"U-S-A!\"\n\nThat comment was significant because the 14th Amendment reads: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\"\n\nTED CRUZ: BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP 'INCENTIVIZES' ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, NEEDS TO GO\n\nSome Republicans are advancing the theory that illegal immigrants are not \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the U.S. within the meaning of that provision, which would give Congress the legal daylight to pass a law codifying Trump's view, modifying the current Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA) of 1952 and ending birthright citizenship.\n\nWhile an 1898 Supreme Court case appears contrary to that view, the issue has not been tested in the courts in modern times, and Republicans are newly emboldened by the 5-4 conservative majority on the Supreme Court.\n\nStill, Trump's suggestion that he could legally bypass Congress and simply issue a unilateral executive order to enact his proposed change was \"obviously\" incorrect, Ryan said this week.\n\nThat prompted Trump to fire back on Twitter and charge that Ryan \"knows nothing about the issue.\" The president also said Ryan should \"focus on holding the Majority\" -- a nod to polls showing that Republicans face tough odds to retain control of the House after the Nov. 6 midterm elections.\n\nTrump also followed up with a clip of a 1993 speech from former Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, in which he claimed that \"no sane country\" would have birthright citizenship. Reid reversed his position in 1999, under pressure from union groups.\n\nFox News' Greg Norman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "Play Audio Clip Listen to audio clip.\n\nToo Far?

Scott Walker on Thursday called Barack Obama \u201cthe biggest liar of the world,\u201d in reference to the former Democratic president\u2019s infamous claim that people could keep their health care plans under ObamaCare.\n\nWalker, locked in a tight re-election battle with Democratic challenger Tony Evers, made the comments during a campaign speech in Waukesha with House Speaker Paul Ryan at his side.\n\nReferencing how Wisconsin Democrats brought Obama in to rally voters last week, Walker mentioned how Politifact in 2013 rated Obama\u2019s claim about keeping their health care its \u201clie of the year.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I guess if you\u2019re going to lie about health care and pre-existing conditions, you might as well bring in the biggest liar of the world,\u201d Walker said.\n\nIS SCOTT WALKER'S WINNING STREAK NEARING AN END? WISCONSIN RACE POSES CHALLENGE\n\nVideo of Walker\u2019s comments were posted on social media.\n\nCampaigning in Wisconsin last week, Obama called Walker a liar over his campaign ads on health care.\n\n\u201cYour governor has been running an ad during election time saying he is going to protect pre-existing conditions when he is literally doing the opposite,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat is some kind of gall. That is some kind of chutzpah. But let\u2019s also call it what it is. It is a lie.\u201d\n\nThe Fox News Gubernatorial Power Rankings lists the Wisconsin governor\u2019s race as \u201clean Democrat,\u201d with most polls showing Walker trailing. But a Marquette University Law School Poll released Wednesday shows the contest at a dead heat, with Walker and Evers tied at 47 percent.", "Executive Editor Of RealClearPolitics Tom Bevan joined Fox News Radio's Guy Benson and Marie Harf to talk about the upcoming midterm election.\n\nOn people saying we can't trust the polls after 2016: Once again you've got Nate Silver with 86.5294% saying Dems are going to win the House and he keeps saying well 15% of Republicans keeping the House is not nothing. When you look at the toss up races in the House in particular there a lot for races that we don't have any polls for at all and another bunch of races where we have one poll and it's from The New York Times. And some of these races are even. Someone's up a point or two on either side. I mean they're very very close races. So, you can actually look at this data and construct a scenario where yeah sure Dems it breaks their way and they win 40 plus seats. You can still also construct a scenario where if Republicans turn out at the polls where they keep the House of Representatives. (00:46)\n\nOn possibility pollsters are underestimating how big a Blue Wave could be: When we look back at this election in hindsight, the way this stuff typically happens is one side is going to have a good night and it's going to represent itself across all these races in the House and the Senate and these races are not going to break. The 30 toss ups very very unlikely given historical patterns that they're going to break 15 for Dems 15 for Republicans. (4:32)\n\nOn if Republicans leading early voting means anything: The short answer is no. I think we often spend a lot of time trying to read these tea leaves on early voters and we did this a lot in 2016 and we're doing it again because more states are having early voting. It's becoming a more normal thing to vote early, but we don't know if those are new voters, if they're just cannibalizing voters who would have turned out on election day, and if they are voting for their party. We just don't know so much about it. (7:06)\n\nOn an Andrew Gillum-Rick Scott voter: It is fascinating and I guess the point to be made was that in a race that it this close things like that could make the difference. These are folks that this is what they're telling pollsters they're going to do. It doesn't mean it's actually what they're going to do. So, we'll have to wait and see what the numbers are, but it's an interesting idea that you could have a split ticket voter. These are not moderates. (12:15)", "It took Eric Lund a few months after he woke up in a San Antonio hospital to understand that he\u2019d lost both of his arms.\n\nLund, an Army National Guard Sgt., was injured in a roadside bomb explosion in May 2012 while serving in Afghanistan. In addition to losing his arms, he suffered a brain injury that affected how he processed new information.\n\nIn Nov. 2017, the 35-year-old became the first patient in the U.S. to undergo a double above-the-elbow arm transplant. Now, almost one year later, he has regained movement in his fingers, and his left hand can pick up foam blocks. His progress is featured in an episode of \"The Innovators.\"\n\n\u201cEric lost both arms at a very high level, which means it\u2019s closer to the shoulders than the wrist,\u201d Dr. W.P. Andrew Lee, professor and director of the department of plastic and reconstructive surgery at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Lund\u2019s lead surgeon, told Fox News. \u201cThe level of transplantation influences the timing of recovery because every time we do a transplantation, the nerves need to regrow from where the nerves are reconnected all the way down to the fingertips and that\u2019s a process that takes time.\u201d\n\nMOM SAYS DAUGHTER 'SCREAMED BLOODY MURDER' AFTER TOUCHING POISONOUS CATERPILLAR\n\nLee said it\u2019s estimated that nerves regrow at one inch per month, meaning that Lund is not expected to fully regain sensation in his arms for up to three years. Lee added that while it may seem like a longer period than for a hand transplant, his patient\u2019s recovery is \u201cwell on course\u201d to restore motor and sensory function.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing I\u2019m working toward is getting used to the hands,\u201d Lund, who enlisted in the military at age 19 after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, told Fox News. \u201cI do a lot of exercises and various strengthening.\u201d\n\nLund, who received two Purple Hearts and is now running for local office in his hometown of Ludington, Mich., and wants to return to school and eventually own a business, said that before the surgery he was trying to make life as normal as he could. It was his aunt who had mentioned the potential for a double arm transplant, and who eventually connected him with Dr. Lee, a member and past board member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\n\nLee and Lund spoke by phone and eventually met in person while Lund continued rehabilitation at the Center for the Intrepid in San Antonio. Lund was then on his way to Johns Hopkins for further testing, which included medical, physical and psychological.\n\n\u201cWe met his family and our team became convinced that he was an excellent candidate for transplant despite such a high-level of transplantation,\u201d Lee said.\n\nThen came the waiting game for Lund. He returned home and was active in the community, played soccer, and tried not to concentrate on if the call for a potential donor would come.\n\nThe call did eventually come in November when he was home watching basketball. He was told there was a 4:30 p.m. flight to Baltimore that he needed to be on in order for it to happen.\n\nFRANCE INVESTIGATES REPORTS OF BABIES BORN WITHOUT ARMS IN RURAL AREAS\n\nOnce there, four different surgical teams, each dedicated to an arm, were involved in the transplant surgery, and the 14 hours of careful reconstruction that followed.\n\nBut he\u2019s not out of the woods yet. Lund is constantly monitoring his arms for signs of rejection and is on a regimen of immunosuppressant medication.\n\n\u201cAny transplant recipient, whether it\u2019s kidney, liver or arms, are at risk of some rejection,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWhen it comes to arms, we have the advantage of seeing the part, when it\u2019s an organ, it\u2019s not visible.\u201d\n\nLee said signs of rejection could manifest as a rash, redness or swelling, which gives Lund the ability to flag the team. Lee said many times the symptoms can be treated with a topical cream or an adjustment to the immunosuppressant medication that reverses the rejection.\n\nLee, who works with the Department of Defense to treat soldiers with upper extremity loss, said he hopes procedures like Lund\u2019s become more mainstream. Lund\u2019s surgery is considered part of a research project which means the cost of the procedure and recovery was covered.\n\n\u201cPeople with such high level of amputation above-the-elbow really don\u2019t have good options when it comes to prosthetics, and when you have double arm amputation it limits functionality even more,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe arm transplantation at a high level can help restore function, and we hope that it will be more well-known by everyone, and then something that the insurance companies will cover in the future.\u201d", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nCuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel arrived in Russia on Thursday for talks expected to focus on expanding economic ties between the two nations.\n\nAs part of his three-day state visit, Diaz-Canel is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin on Friday.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Soviet Union poured billions of dollars in supplies and subsidies to Cuba, its staunchest Latin American ally. But ties withered after the 1991 Soviet collapse as Russia, hit by an economic meltdown, withdrew its economic aid to Cuba.\n\nPutin, who visited Cuba in 2000 and 2014, has sought to revive ties with the old Caribbean ally.\n\nEarlier this month, Russian officials have signed contracts worth $260 million to modernize Cuban energy facilities and a metal factory. The two countries have also talked about expanding military ties.\n\nSoviet warships and military aircraft regularly used Cuban bases during the Cold War, and Cuba hosted a Soviet electronic spying facility in Lourdes, near Havana.\n\nPutin closed the Lourdes intelligence facility in 2001 as he sought to establish warmer ties with the United States during his first presidential term. But U.S.-Russian relations have steadily worsened, plunging to post-Cold War lows after Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, and the Kremlin has sought to rebuild ties with Cuba.\n\nThe business daily Kommersant reported earlier this month that Russia plans to provide a $50 million loan to Cuba to help it maintain and modernize its Soviet-built weapons.\n\nPutin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that military-technical cooperation will be part of the agenda of Putin's talks with Diaz-Canel, but refused to elaborate.\n\nRussian officials have kept mum on re-establishing Moscow's military presence in Cuba, but some suggested it could also be part of discussions.\n\nVladimir Shamanov, the head of defense affairs committee in the lower house of the Russian parliament, said earlier this week that Russia and Cuba may consider the issue.", "For Democrats running in red or purple territory, winning races in the age of Donald Trump means positioning themselves as centrists.\n\nBut for some, it also means shedding \u2013 or downplaying \u2013 their past liberal activism, donations and comments.\n\nPerhaps nowhere is this shift more apparent than in Arizona, where Democrat Kyrsten Sinema is locked in one of the country's closest Senate races with Republican Martha McSally.\n\nSTATE OF THE MIDTERMS: ANALYST PREDICTS BIGGER HOUSE GAINS FOR DEMS AS PELOSI EYES GAVEL\n\nIn this contest, Sinema has cultivated an image as a moderate Democrat in a red state \u2013 for example, she has said Immigration and Customs Enforcement holds an \"important function\" even as progressives call for abolishing ICE.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t long ago that she was a Ralph Nader-supporting, pink tutu-wearing Iraq War protester who referred to herself as a \u201cPrada socialist\u201d in 2006. She first ran, and lost, a state legislative race in 2002 on Arizona\u2019s liberal Green Party ticket.\n\nRepublicans have zeroed in on Sinema\u2019s past activism to paint her as much more liberal than she portrays herself.\n\n\u201cWhile we were in harm\u2019s way in uniform, Kyrsten Sinema was protesting us in a pink tutu and denigrating our service,\u201d McSally, a retired Air Force fighter pilot and a member of Congress, said in a memorable television ad.\n\nIn recent weeks, Sinema has sustained a steady stream of revelations that she made past critical comments about her state, including once jokingly referring to Arizona as the \u201cmeth lab of democracy\u201d in 2010. Sinema in 2011 implied that her home state produced \"crazy\" in a speech in which she also promised to advise liberal activists how to \"stop your state from becoming Arizona.\"\n\nA Sinema campaign spokesman did not return a request for comment. But in a recent interview with the Atlantic, the Democratic congresswoman said she appeals to voters from multiple parties.\n\n\u201cFolks are so excited \u2026 that we\u2019re attracting support from Democrats, Republicans, and independents,\u201d Sinema said. \u201cIn Arizona, folks don\u2019t really care what letter is behind your name.\u201d\n\nThe most recent Fox News Poll shows Sinema and McSally tied at 46 percent each.\n\nOthers running as more centrist Democrats include Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, the incumbent senator who is fighting to keep her seat from Republican Josh Hawley. McCaskill, who voted against Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination for the Supreme Court, emphasized this week that she often supports President Trump's nominees.\n\n\u201cI voted for over 70 percent of President Trump's judicial nominees 70 percent -- 70 percent,\u201d McCaskill told Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier. \u201cI voted for more than half of his Cabinet members. I vote with him half the time. He's signed 38 of my bills into law.\u201d\n\nMcCaskill also backed up Trump, who has called for stopping the caravan of 4,000 Central American migrants headed toward the United States.\n\n\u201cI think the president has to use every tool he has at his disposal,\u201d McCaskill said. \u201cAnd I 100 percent back him up on that.\u201d\n\nFurther, she distanced herself from what she calls \"crazy\" Democrats.\n\nBut her Republicans opponent called her comments \u201ca bunch of nonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, this is somebody who votes with Chuck Schumer 90 percent of the time,\u201d Hawley told Fox News' \"America's Newsroom.\" \u201cWhen it comes to Brett Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch, tax cuts, immigration, tariffs -- Senator McCaskill has been against this president and against our state on every issue that matters.

Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the House GOP leadership.\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon reported that Brown, a former state legislator and chancellor of Washington State University Spokane, founded a socialist bookstore in the 1970s. According to the outlet, that bookstore's Facebook page describes the Left Hand Book and Record Collective today as \"Boulder's one-stop-shop for all socialist, resistance, revolutionary, radical, alternative, and anti-capitalist literature.\"\n\nThere have also apparently been efforts to downplay the Democrat\u2019s background: Media consultants for Brown attempted to edit her Wikipedia page to remove mentions of her travels to Nicaragua and Cuba, the Free Beacon reported.\n\nBrown's campaign told Fox News such stories amount to \"red-baiting.\"\n\n\"These 'red-baiting' stories are obviously misleading and desperate attempts in a close race to distract people from the top issue people care about in eastern Washington, which is health care,\" Brown spokesman Keeley Smith said.\n\nBut McMorris Rodgers spokesman Jared Powell shot back: \u201cPeople in Eastern Washington want freedom, opportunity, self-determination, and free markets. Lisa Brown does not reflect those values, and she will go to any length to try and hide from her long and radical record.\u201d\n\nOther Democrats have made dramatic announcements to show they can be bipartisan: Phil Bredesen, running against Republican Marsha Blackburn for the Senate in Tennessee, announced last month he would back Trump\u2019s choice of Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court \u2013 even as all but one Democrat in the Senate opposed his confirmation.\n\n\u201cPresidents have the right to appoint justices who share their values\u2013elections have consequences. I believe a Senator\u2019s responsibility to \u2018advise and consent\u2019 is not a license to indulge in partisanship, but should focus on the qualifications of the nominee, their ethics and their temperament,\u201d Bredesen said at the time.\n\nStill, Bredesen -- the wealthy former Democratic governor of Tennessee \u2013 has given generously to top Democrats over the years: He shelled out about a half-million to liberal politicians before running for the Senate, including for the Democratic presidential campaigns of Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\nFox News\u2019 Brooke Singman contributed to this report.", "Dana Perino, Host of The Daily Briefing, Co-host The Five, and former Press Secretary to President George W.

He does very few policy speeches from the White House though when he does he figures out a way to make them very specific. So for this one they cleared out the Roosevelt room and they had him give a speech there. The Roosevelt room is important because it's just across from the Oval Office, that is where a lot of big policy decisions are made on an inter-agency basis. This is an inter-agency problem becuase he has DOD, DHS, DOJ, Health & Human Services, probably forgetting others, but there's a lot of moving parts that the federal government has to play here, the State Department, USAID, etc. He made a couple of big announcements. One is that we're not going to do catch and release. That's just not going to happen. (00:34)\n\nOn politics driving Trump's focus on immigration before the midterms: Definitely his closing argument before the midterms is about law and order and immigration. It's a hodge podge of things. The President is throwing a lot of stuff up against the wall. Some of it will stick. (3:21)\n\nOn Fox New's new groundbreaking way to cover elections: They're going to interview up 125,000 people. I think it's all phone and some internet with 125,000 people, previously you would maybe only get a sample of 25,000 people and it usually skewed very far left and that's why you had those problems from before. This will give us a lot more rich detail and attitudes about voting, where they're voting, why they're voting and what motivated them. So you have a little bit more of a one on one way to actually do research that you've never had before. It'll be so much more fulfilling for people to see what we have on the Fox News voter analysis. (5:25)\n\nOn races she is watching: I'm actually sort of interested in some of the ballot initiatives that are happening. There are four states that are asking the question to their voters, 'Should they expand Medicaid?' and to me that's really more of a national debate because if states are expanding Medicaid that means other people are going to have to pay for it that aren't in those states.

To deal with it you must go to the heart of it and thereafter it then loosens its hold on everything else.\" He said South Africa's criminal justice system \"will kick into action\" and the time will come when \"people are arrested, charged, found guilty and go to jail.\"\n\nRamaphosa, 65, rose to prominence in the 1980s as a trade union organizer in the struggle against apartheid, South Africa's former system of racial discrimination. When he became president in February, many South Africans hailed him as a leader who could steer South Africa back to the optimistic days when Nelson Mandela led South Africa from apartheid to democracy.\n\nHowever, nearly nine months into his presidency Ramaphosa has not found a quick fix to the country's problems, including unemployment at 27 percent and inequality ranked among the highest in the world. South Africa's economy, one of Africa's largest, is in recession. More than 24 years after the end of racial discrimination, many South African blacks complain they remain poor and disadvantaged.\n\nA pressing issue is land, with whites owning large swathes of farmland that were taken from black families during apartheid. The ANC and Ramaphosa have vowed to redistribute land without compensation, which has pleased some of their supporters but has alarmed many businessmen and potential international investors.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump waded into the land controversy in August when he tweeted that South Africa is seizing farms and that high numbers of farmers are being killed. In fact, the South African government has not authorized land seizures and says it is still deliberating on the best way to implement land reform.\n\nRamaphosa said Thursday that South Africa's land reform will not be as chaotic and economically disastrous as that in neighboring Zimbabwe.\n\n\"We will not have any land grabs ... It will be a South African solution where we will be sure to act within our constitution and the rule of law ... It should never be anything that will degrade our economy or lead to national divisions. The way we deal with the land question should enhance the growth in our country.\"\n\nAfter Trump's controversial tweet, Ramaphosa said he sat next to the American president at a lunch at the United Nations and said they exchanged pleasantries.\n\n\"To the extent that we spoke about land, he spoke about golf courses,\" said Ramaphosa. \"That is land, I guess.\"", "The Army has been working on a new bullet that is bigger, bolder and harder hitting that will help make U.S. soldiers even more unstoppable.\n\nWhen you combine this new generation of bullet with the new generation of weapons for soldiers \u2013 then they will be able to shoot farther \u2013 with accuracy \u2013 than any known military rifle on earth.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of mystery, buzz and speculation about this new generation of bullets.

The number refers to the diameter of the bullet so the new round will be more than a millimeter bigger in diameter.\n\nThe 5.56mm has been short on enough mass to defeat advanced body armor. The larger current option, the 7.62mm bullets, are short on propellant with too much mass.\n\nBEE-SIZED BOTS SET TO DOMINATE FUTURE BATTLES FOR CITIES\n\nThe 6.8 round is the solution.

This translates into better threat stopping power for soldiers.\n\nLonger supersonic velocity than the currently used bullets combined with less recoil and more stable shooting should deliver even greater accuracy.\n\nThis will be quite a radical change up for the Army, which has relied on the 5.56mm round for several decades, but one that could play a vital role in ensuring soldiers are armed to match future threats.\n\nSTOPPING POWER\n\nSince these new bullets would be larger and harder hitting, they would be a better match for the threats soldiers will likely face in future conflicts.\n\nThe 6.8mm rounds are expected to be capable of penetrating currently available modern body armor as well as defeat future advances in body armor too.\n\nIf U.S. soldiers have to face forces from countries with well-equipped armies, then current bullets are not good enough. American ingenuity can do better and American soldiers deserve the best that can be provided.\n\nARMY SETS SIGHTS ON NEW CONCEALABLE MACHINE GUN\n\nThere are very justified concerns that the 5.56 round will not penetrate armor that has become increasingly available to adversaries, even at an organization level, such as ISIS.\n\nIf the bullets cannot penetrate enemy body armor, then those bullets are far less likely to stop a dangerous threat.\n\nEquipping troops with more advanced bullets and weapons means that in these scenarios they will be safer and more effective with fewer rounds.\n\nPODCAST: JOIN THE GREEN BERETS FOR DANGEROUS JUNGLE WARFARE MISSIONS\n\nFARTHER THAN ANY KNOWN MILITARY RIFLE\n\nThere\u2019s a third very crucial advantage these new bullets could provide soldiers in the battlespace \u2013 farther accurate range.\n\nThe goal is to create bullets that will help deliver enhanced accuracy and range.\n\nWhen combined with the new generation of weapons the Army has underway, these bullets should be able to penetrate advanced enemy body armor even at distances of about 2,000 feet away.\n\nHANDGUN DESIGNED FOR THE MILITARY NOW AVAILABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CIVILIANS\n\nIn fact, the Army seems determined to ensure their soldiers arrive to face an enemy with ammunition and rifles that shoot with accuracy farther than any known military rifle.\n\nSO WHAT WEAPON WILL IT BE USED WITH?\n\nThe U.S. Army has selected a new round to replace those equipping its M4A1 carbine and M249 Squad Automatic Weapons.\n\nEarlier this Summer, five companies were chosen to produce prototype weapons in this new 6.8mm round. They are expected to develop two different ammunition cartridges utilizing 6.8mm projectiles.\n\nThe Next Generation Squad Weapon will replace the M4A1 carbine for individual infantrymen. The Next Generation Squad Automatic Rifle will replace the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, the \u201cSAW.\u201d\n\nThe five companies chosen were: AAI/Textron Systems, FN America, General Dynamics, PCP Tactical, and Sig Sauer.\n\nFN America was chosen to provide two different variants and the other four companies submitted one prototype of the M4A1 replacement and the M249 replacement.\n\nSAPPHIRE GEM-BASED \u2018TRANSPARENT\u2019 ARMOR PROTECTS SOLDIERS FROM SNIPERS\n\nIn anticipation of threats soldiers may face in future conflicts, the weapons must also be able to perform in chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, cyber and EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attacks.\n\nThey will be able to fire in semi-automatic and fully automatic modes with the same magazine.\n\nIn close battles at night, adversaries often aim at the sound of gunshots and the visual cues of muzzle flashes.\n\nBy incorporating removable sound suppressors and flash hiders to minimize muzzle blast, this should hopefully minimize these targeting aids for the enemy and help keep soldiers safe.\n\nIn addition to qualities you might expect, like performing in all environments and weather conditions and resistance to rust and scratches.\n\nFor mounting further enhancements like optics, soldiers can use the Picatinny rail.\n\nPODCAST: VALOR BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY \u2013 HEAR THE EXTRAORDINARY WAR STORY BEHIND THIS MEDAL OF HONOR\n\n6.8MM FOR CIVILIAN PURPOSES LIKE HUNTING\n\nMany hunters are familiar with this size of round for use with medium game.\n\nRemington Arms with U.S. Special Operations Command and U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit designed the 6.8mm to replace the 5.56 NATO cartridge in AR/M-16 rifles. More than a decade ago they created this option between the bigger 7.62 NATO bullets and the smaller 5.56mm.\n\nAUSA 2018 IN PICTURES: THE BIGGEST LAND WARFARE SHOWCASE IN YEARS\n\nPopular purveyors like Nosler and Hornady offer 6.8mm options for civilians. There are variants for hunters to use with medium-sized game, for home and personal defense as well as shooting matches.\n\nThere have been many misrepresentations in media on this front. The Army will not be simply utilizing this commercially available 6.8 SPC cartridge. The current objective is a new generation of Army bullets that will be the same caliber, but with better range, lethality and many other qualities that remain classified.\n\nNO LONGER COMPATIBLE WITH NATO ALLIES\n\nOne drawback to this shift could potentially be loss of compatibility with NATO allies who widely use the 5.56mm and will most likely lack resources and political will to upgrade their forces similarly.\n\nIt could also impact compatibility with other US forces who may not adopt this upgrade to bigger bullets. But neither of these are factors that outweigh the importance of putting the best possible capabilities in American soldiers\u2019 hands.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT?\n\nArmy leadership is committed to this initiative and reaffirmed this recently at the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington D.C. last month. However, Congress has failed to provide approval for the Army to make the new SAW/NGSW and ammunition upgrade a reality for soldiers in the upcoming year.\n\nU.S. soldiers may have to wait to be given the advantage of a new generation of weapons and bullets that will make them more accurate at distances far greater than any other known military rifle on Earth.", "President Trump has offered State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert the role of U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, a senior administration official told Fox News.\n\nIt is not clear yet is whether she has accepted the offer to replace the outgoing Nikki Haley as ambassador.\n\nThe White House would only say Thursday that Nauert \u201cis under strong consideration.\"\n\nNauert met with Trump in the Oval Office on Monday.

General Assembly on the second day of debate on a resolution calling for ending the U.S.' economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba. The vote is now an annual tradition at the U.N., where Israel and the U.S. are the only countries to vote against the resolution. That tradition was repeated Thursday, where the resolution condemning the embargo passed 189-2 to applause from the chamber.\n\nIn her remarks ahead of the vote, coming after a lengthy list of speakers lined up to condemn the U.S., Haley said the resolution would not help a single Cuban family or feed one Cuban child, and defended the decades-long embargo.\n\n\u201cOur reason for the embargo is and has always been Cuba\u2019s denial of freedom and the denial of the most basic of human rights for the Cuban people,\u201d she said. \u201cThe United States will continue to stand with the Cuban people until their rights and their freedoms are restored. Period. We won\u2019t back down.\u201d\n\nHaley also accused countries of acting from anti-U.S. bias rather than from concern for the Cuban people: \u201cIt\u2019s one more time that countries feel they can poke the United States in the eye. But you\u2019re not hurting the U.S. when you do this. You are literally hurting the Cuban people by telling the regime that their treatment of their people is acceptable.\"\n\nAfter the vote, Haley said that \"there are no winners here today, only losers.\"\n\n\"The U.N. has lost, it has rejected the opportunity to speak on behalf of human rights,\u201d she said.\n\nUS TO COUNTER UN VOTE ON CUBA EMBARGO WITH AMENDMENTS CALLING OUT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES\n\nThe Obama administration had sought to soften the U.S. stance toward the Cuban dictatorship, but Congress did not lift the embargo. In 2016, the Obama administration only abstained on the U.N. resolution condemning the embargo. The Trump administration has adopted a tougher stance, and last year voted against the resolution.\n\nThis year it went a step further, introducing amendments that call out human rights abuses, and call upon the regime to abide by human rights norms. One urged Cuba \u201cto fully grant its citizens internationally recognized civil, political, and economic rights and freedoms, including freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, and free access to information.\u201d Another amendment urged Cuba \"to release persons arbitrarily detained for the legitimate exercise of their human rights, to consider rescinding unduly harsh sentences for exercising such fundamental freedoms and to end reprisals against individuals, including for cooperating with the United Nations human rights mechanisms.\"\n\n\u201cThis year, you will be asked to vote not just on the American embargo. You will be asked to also vote on Cuba\u2019s political prisoners. You will be asked to vote on Cuba\u2019s lack of freedom of expression. You will be asked to vote on Cuba\u2019s oppression of workers,\u201d Haley said. \u201cThis year, you have the opportunity to do something that will send an unmistakable message to the people of Cuba that the world is not ignoring their suffering.\u201d\n\nThose amendments, however, were overwhelmingly shot down. Only Ukraine voted in support of all the amendments with Israel and the U.S. Between 65 and 67 nations abstained, and the remaining countries voted against. The Canadian ambassador said its vote was not against the substance of the U.S. amendments but it was voting against them because the resolution was not \"a suitable platform\" to consider Cuba's respect for its human rights obligations.\n\nA U.S Mission official told Fox News that the votes showed why the embargo is necessary: \"Other countries and the U.N. cannot be counted on to do anything about Cuban human rights. Only the U.S. will do it. Today's votes proved that.\"\n\nThe debate was peppered with ambassadors -- many from countries with poor human rights records -- stepping up to the podium to condemn the U.S. in strong terms and at length. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez accused the U.S. of \u201cflagrant and massive systematic violation of the human rights of Cuban men and women.\u201d The Iranian ambassador accused the U.S. of violating the U.N. Charter and international law, describing the embargo as the \u201cmost unjust and longest unilateral sanctions against a country in modern world history.\u201d He was applauded by the chamber, as were the representatives for Syria and Venezuela. Haley\u2019s remarks were met with silence.\n\nThe representative for Bolivia on Wednesday told the chamber that Cuba was an example of \u201cdignity and unwavering strength\u201d in the face of what he called a \u201ccriminal embargo.\u201d He said the Trump administration\u2019s stance as \u201can abhorrent relic of the Cold War and an egregious example of unilateral, illegitimate sanctions.\u201d\n\nA number of countries said they regretted the abandonment of the Obama-era thaw. The representative for Egypt said that the thaw was a step in the right direction, but was ultimately \u201cinadequate.\u201d Austria, speaking on behalf of the E.U. expressed hope that lifting the embargo would open up the Cuban economy.\n\nHALEY DEMANDS UN PUNISH CUBA, BOLIVIA AFTER 'MOB SCENE' AT US EVENT FOR CUBAN POLITICAL PRISONERS\n\nBut Haley dismissed the idea that continuing the Obama thaw policy would encourage the Cuban dictatorship to grant more freedoms to its people.\n\n\u201cSupporters of the resolution claim that a change in U.S. policy would somehow transform life for the Cuban people. But the government of Cuba doesn\u2019t agree. It responded to the softening of our Cuba policy under President Obama with more, not less, political repression of its people,\u201d she said.\n\nThe resolution is the latest spat between the U.S. and Cuba at the U.N.

Both men were among the Mercury Seven, the group of astronauts that piloted America's first manned spaceflights in the 1960s.\n\nNow, both astronauts are gone and Matt says the brothers want the public to get a chance at the golden helmet, which Glenn wore while setting the transcontinental speed record during 1957's \"Project Bullet.\" He gave it to Carpenter, who was a good friend, as a gift.\n\nThe helmet will be offered at auction by Dallas-based Heritage Auctions on Friday, a kind of astronautical addendum to a larger, previously announced sale involving the personal collection of another famed astronaut, Neil Armstrong.\n\nA series of auctions involving some 2,000 artifacts and mementos owned by Armstrong, the first person to walk on the moon, begins Thursday and runs through November 2019.\n\nThe event now brings together three big names in aviation history: Glenn, Armstrong and Wright.\n\nAmong Armstrong's personal items are pieces of a wing and propeller from the 1903 Wright Flyer, the first successful heavier-than-air powered aircraft. Armstrong, who like Glenn and brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright was from Ohio, took the items with him to the moon.\n\nAs with the Glenn helmet, Armstrong's items landed in the lap of the next generation after the famed astronaut died in 2012. Carpenter died in 2013 and Glenn followed in 2016, at age 95, the last surviving Mercury Seven astronaut. An estate sale of his belongings took place in March.\n\nWhen the Carpenters discovered Armstrong's sons had organized a sale of their famous father's memorabilia, Matt Carpenter said the helmet seemed like an ideal fit. An effort to auction it earlier this year had been unsuccessful.\n\n\"Obviously, we'd love to get the most money realized for it, but also we'd love to get somebody who's going to appreciate it,\" he said. \"I think it's a very special thing.\"\n\nCarpenter, now 40, and his brother Nick, who turns 39 this week, would like to use some of the proceeds to help underwrite a documentary they are producing about the Glenn-Carpenter friendship.

Many of the women who were interviewed said authorities sexually abused them as they attempted to travel across the country\u2019s border.\n\n\u201cThe North Koreans we spoke with told us that unwanted sexual contact and violence is so common that it has come to be accepted as part of ordinary life: sexual abuse by officials, and the impunity they enjoy, is linked to larger patterns of sexual abuse and impunity in the country,\u201d the report stated.\n\nInterviewees told the human rights group that government officials harmed them while they were in detention centers.\n\nKIM JONG UN TO VISIT SEOUL \u2018SOON,\u2019 SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT REVEALS\n\n\"Interviewees told us that when a guard or police officer 'picks' a woman, she has no choice but to comply with any demands he makes, whether for sex, money or other favors,\" the report said. \"Women in custody have little choice should they attempt to refuse or complain afterward, and risk sexual violence, longer periods in detention, beatings, forced labor or increased scrutiny while conducting market activities.\"\n\nYoon Mi Hwa, who fled the hermit kingdom in 2014, claimed in the report that a prison guard sexually abused her.\n\n\u201cClick, click, click was the most horrible sound I ever heard,\u201d she said. \"It was the sound of the key of the cell of our prison room opening.

Barely counted in life, these migrants rarely register in death \u2014 almost as if they never lived at all.\n\nA growing number of migrants have drowned, died in deserts or fallen prey to traffickers, leaving their families to wonder what on earth happened to them. At the same time, anonymous bodies are filling cemeteries in South Africa's Gauteng province , or in the coastal Tunisian town of Zarzis. Similar cemeteries dot Italy, Greece and Libya.\n\nAn Associated Press tally has documented more than 56,800 migrants dead or missing worldwide since 2014 \u2014 almost double the number found in the world's only official attempt to try to count them, by the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration . The IOM toll as of Oct. 1 was more than 28,500. The AP came up with almost 28,300 additional dead or missing migrants by compiling information from other international groups, forensic records, missing persons reports, death records, and examining data from thousands of interviews with migrants.\n\nThe AP's tally is also certainly an undercount. Bodies lie undiscovered in desert sands or at the bottom of the sea. And families don't always report loved ones as missing because they migrated illegally, or because they left home without saying exactly where they were headed.\n\nInstead, families are caught between hope and mourning, like that of Safi al-Bahri. Her son, Majdi Barhoumi, left their hometown of Ras Jebel, Tunisia, on May 7, 2011 for Europe in a small boat with a dozen other migrants. The boat sank and Barhoumi hasn't been heard from since. In a sign of faith that he is alive, his mother and father built an animal pen with a brood of hens, a few cows and a dog to stand watch until he returns.\n\n\"I just wait for him. I always imagine him behind me, at home, in the market, everywhere,\" said al-Bahri. \"When I hear a voice at night, I think he's come back. When I hear the sound of a motorcycle, I think my son is back.\"\n\nThe official U.N. toll extensively documents deaths in the Mediterranean and Europe, but even there cases fall through the cracks. The political tide is turning against migrants in Europe just as in the United States , where the government is cracking down heavily on caravans of Central Americans trying to get in. One result is that money is drying up for projects to track migration and its costs.\n\nFor example, when more than 800 people died in an April 2015 shipwreck off the coast of Italy, Europe's deadliest migrant sea disaster, Italian investigators pledged to identify them and find their families. More than three years later, under a new populist government, funding for this work has been cut off.\n\nBeyond Europe , information is even more scarce. Even in the U.S., where migration has turned into a hot-button issue, there is no routine effort to figure out where migrants may disappear or die, nor a policy on identifying bodies and notifying families. And little is known about the toll in South America, where the Venezuelan migration is among the world's biggest today, and in Asia , the top region for numbers of migrants.\n\nThe result is that governments vastly underestimate the true toll of migration, a major political and social issue in most of the world today.\n\n\"No matter where you stand on the whole migration management debate ... these are still human beings on the move,\" said Bram Frouws, the head of the Mixed Migration Centre, which has done surveys of more than 20,000 migrants in its 4Mi project since 2014. \"Whether it's refugees or people moving for jobs, they are human beings.\"\n\nThe missing include children, although once again the scant data is only in Europe.

He never saw his brother again. When he next spoke to his mother, he couldn't bring himself to tell her; instead, he lied that his brother couldn't come to the phone but sent his love.\n\nThe family phone number in Afghanistan no longer works, their village is overrun with Taliban, and he has no idea how to find them \u2014 or the child whose hand slipped from his grasp four years ago.\n\n\"I don't know now where they are,\" he said, his face anguished as he sat on a sun-dappled bench in rural France. \"They also don't know where I am.\"", "The Latest on the scheduled execution of Tennessee inmate Edmund Zagorski (all times local):\n\n11:20 a.m.\n\nWith just hours left before his scheduled execution, condemned Tennessee inmate Edmund Zagorski is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to put a stop to it.\n\nOn Thursday Zagorski asked the court take up his claim that it's unconstitutional to force him to choose between the electric chair and lethal injection.

Just last week the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan stopped by Karzai's office, where Karzai attached several conditions to Washington's efforts to find a negotiated end to the protracted conflict.\n\nHe also has met with Washington's new peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad. Since Khalilzad's appointment last month, peace efforts have accelerated.\n\nThe five former Guantanamo Taliban detainees __ some of whom have disturbing pasts and all of whom were close to the hard-line founder of the Taliban movement, Mullah Mohammed Omar __ have come out of the shadows to join the insurgent group's political office in the Middle Eastern state of Qatar where they will be involved in peace negotiations. They were released in 2014 in exchange for captured U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.\n\nThe co-founder of the Taliban movement, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, was released from a Pakistani jail where he had been since his arrest in 2010 in a joint U.S. and Pakistan operation. His release had long been demanded by the Taliban. It came following Khalilzad's trip to Pakistan last month, his first as a new peace envoy.\n\nBaradar was reportedly arrested after seeking to start peace talks with Karzai without Pakistan's involvement. In the interview, Karzai accused both the U.S. and Pakistan of foiling talks with Baradar at the time. He also said he made repeated attempts to gain Baradar's release, but his efforts were thwarted by both the U.S. and Pakistan.\n\nKarzai's final term in power was marked by a prickly relationship with the United States. He bitterly criticized Washington for steamrolling ahead with development plans, without consulting Afghans, who often found projects unusable or impossible to maintain. He openly fought with the U.S. military over tactics, like night-time raids that infuriated Afghans, secret prisons and the use of drones, saying it strengthened the Taliban and weakened his government.\n\nKarzai said he still has reservations about Washington's intentions as it seeks to find a negotiated exit to 17 years of war, but welcomed Khalilzad in the role of peace maker.\n\n\"I believe he has all the right tools to conduct this if he is given freedom by the U.S. government to act toward peace and peace building in Afghanistan,\" he said.\n\nKarzai has a history with Khalilzad, who was U.S. President George Bush's special envoy to Afghanistan following the 2001 collapse of the Taliban-ruled government. Khalilzad, who later served as the U.S. ambassador, was a strong proponent of Karzai for president of the first post-Taliban government.\n\nStill, Karzai told The AP that Afghans are watching this latest peace initiative.\n\nAn opponent of direct U.S. talks with the Taliban when he was Afghanistan's president, Karzai now sees it as a necessity because the Taliban today control large swaths of the country. In a report released Thursday, Washington's own Special Inspector General on Afghan Reconstruction (SIGAR) said the government has ceded even more territory to insurgents and now controls just over 50 percent of the country.\n\n\"The Taliban are Afghans and no doubt they control a great part of Afghan territory and that's a fact of life,\" said Karzai. \"Afghanistan and the rest of the world must live with that, therefore a negotiation with them is necessary and good. Let the Americans talk to them.\"\n\nDraped in his traditional green-striped coat, Karzai spelled out the conditions he said he laid out \"with clarity\" for many U.S. officials who have made a visit to his office, including Khalilzad.\n\nForemost among them is a warning to Washington against making deals with neighbor Pakistan, which most Afghans blame for many of their troubles and whom they accuse of aiding and giving sanctuary to Taliban insurgents.\n\nEven as president Karzai loudly accused Washington of being in cahoots with Islamabad to keep Afghanistan destabilized to further their own interests \u2014 Washington to keep an eye on its foes Iran, Russia and China and Pakistan to keep Afghanistan as a client state.\n\n\"We will in an extremely forceful way oppose any deals between the U.S. and Pakistan on Afghanistan and Afghan destiny,\" said Karzai adding that peace negotiations also need to involve regional powers, most notably Russia and China as well as neighbors including Iran.\n\n\"Afghans just want peace and a sovereign country and they want to be left alone to their own, to make a living and to do better in their lives,\" he said.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nThe Brazilian judge at the center of one of the largest corruption investigations in history said Thursday he would become justice minister in the government of President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, a decision that will be hailed by Brazilians eager for a crackdown on graft but also add to deep polarization after a bruising presidential campaign.\n\nMoro is wildly popular among conservatives and loathed by many on the left, so his decision to join the incoming administration will feed the suspicion of many Brazilians that the judge was politically biased in jailing ex-President Luiz Inacio da Silva, a conviction that forced the poll-leading leftist out of the presidential race.\n\nMoro met with Bolsonaro at the president-elect's home in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday. Upon emerging, Moro did not speak to reporters but soon put out a statement confirming he had accepted the post.\n\nMoro said it would be hard to give up being a judge after 22 years, but he saw an opportunity to \"implement a strong agenda of anti-corruption and anti-organized crime\" in his new role.\n\n\"In practice, this will mean consolidating the advancements against crime and corruption the last years and remove any risks of going backward,\" he wrote.\n\nHe added that the sprawling \"Car Wash\" investigation would continue in the hands of local judges in the southern city of Curitiba, where Moro lives and many of the cases have been tried. He also said he would provide more details on his new role next week.\n\nLaunched in 2014, the \"Car Wash\" investigation uncovered elaborate schemes in which construction companies received bloated contracts and then kicked back billions of dollars in bribes to politicians and other government officials over more than a decade.\n\nThe level of corruption was breathtaking for Brazilians long inured to graft, and led to the jailing of many of the country's biggest names. That list includes da Silva, convicted by Moro of corruption for trading favors with construction company Grupo OAS for the promise of a beachfront apartment. Da Silva began serving a 12-year sentence in April.\n\nThe cases made Moro a wildly popular figure with Brazilians exhausted by numerous stories of politicians plundering government coffers; Earlier this year, he tracked highly in presidential polls even though the judge, quiet and wonky, never expressed interest in running.\n\nHowever, many of his tactics have been highly controversial, such as the use of extended pre-trial detentions and plea bargains, both aimed at getting high-profile suspects to talk.\n\nHe has also been accused of being partisan, with supporters of da Silva and the left-leaning Workers' Party claiming Moro was at the center of a conspiracy to keep da Silva from running for president this year. Even after being jailed, da Silva led preference polls. In September, his candidacy was barred.\n\nIn reality, Moro has convicted politicians from across the political spectrum. But he has also made decisions that many interpret as biased, such as releasing wiretapped conversations between da Silva and then President Dilma Rousseff in 2016.\n\nFor Bolsonaro, a former army captain who ran on promises to crack down on graft and rising crime, landing Moro is a huge boon. But for Moro personally \u2014 he now will become \"political\" as part of an administration \u2014 and the future of the \"Car Wash\" investigations, the decision comes with huge risks.\n\nMembers of the \"Car Wash\" task force have said much work remains, but it's hard to imagine any judge having the gravitas of Moro, who rose to fame because of his ability to sort through complicated white-collar crimes and write decisions that are rarely overturned.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nImages of a tiny red bird that barely fills the palm of one's hand appear everywhere in Venezuela \u2014 printed on money, labels of craft beer bottles and the cover of children's school books.\n\nBut the finch-like red siskin is vanishing from the wild at an alarming rate, falling prey to a century of shrinking forests and poachers cashing in on their brilliant red feathers, prized around the world by breeders of exotic birds.\n\nThat threat has brought together an international team including scientists from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and poor coffee farmers in Venezuela's remote mountains, all set on rescuing it from extinction. The plan is to entice farmers to plant organic coffee groves with layers of thick branches that are inviting to the endangered, perching songbird, which has lost a lot of its habitat.\n\n\"They don't have many years left, unless we do something right now,\" said Miguel Arvelo, a veterinarian for the Caracas-based nonprofit Provita, one of the groups spearheading the effort.\n\nThe \"Cardenalito,\" or \"Little Cardinal\" as it is affectionately called, holds a special place in Venezuelan culture, the poster child of some 1,400 bird species \u2014 from the Amazon to the Andes \u2014 that live in one of the world's most biodiverse landscapes.\n\nOnce flourishing in the millions, as few as 300 remain in the wild in Venezuela, although scientists say it's difficult to estimate their numbers in the politically turbulent and dangerous country.\n\nThe Red Siskin Initiative launched about three years ago on a shoestring budget of less than $100,000 from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and private groups in the U.S. and Venezuela.\n\nPlanting organic groves with thick branches reverses a trend among farmers who boost bean production by thinning coffee groves for more sunlight, or cut them down altogether to plant vegetables that turn a quicker profit.\n\nFarmers who meet the project's strict standards will win the right to market their beans with \"Bird Friendly\" labels and take advantage of a loophole in Venezuelan law to set prices for premium products, sometimes five times higher than price caps set by the socialist government. Eventually they hope to export the coffee.\n\nIn parallel, a red siskin breeding center is being built at a private zoo in Venezuela where 200 birds are expected to be hatched next year, adding to the 25 caged at the Smithsonian Institution, forming a type of Noah's Ark to ensure that the iconic species does not disappear. Red siskins from the center will be introduced into the coffee groves.\n\nWhile still in its early stages, backers say coffee initiative is already showing positive results. Some 40 farmers in the rugged, coastal mountains of Carayaca, northwest of the capital Caracas, have already stopped cutting down trees \u2014 an important first step to creating a robust habitat.\n\nThe tiny bird is prized for its fiery red plumage and jet-black hood on males, coveted by breeders who cross them with less colorful canaries to produce offspring of orange or red spots.\n\nProtection under Venezuelan law dating back to the 1940s hasn't stopped poachers from catching it to sell on the international black market. Online they go for more than $300, and demand remains high in Eastern Europe and Asia, scientists say.\n\nAdding to challenges, poor Venezuelan families often capture and sell the threatened bird to illegal traffickers. The profit can feed their children for months, said biologist Jhonathan Miranda, a Provita researcher.\n\nMichael Braun, co-founder of the Red Siskin Initiative and a research scientist at Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, said Venezuela's deepening crisis has also taken a toll.\n\nThe oil-rich nation was for decades a coveted destination for naturalists and amateur birders. But recently a field researcher in a remote mountain range was robbed of his binoculars and then shot at by two young men on a motorcycle, Braun said. At least one key member of their research team joined a growing exodus of Venezuelans fleeing the country.\n\n\"Every time I tell somebody we have an endangered bird project in Venezuela, they say, 'Oh, Venezuela? Good luck,'\" Braun said. \"It's a challenge.\"\n\nThe red siskin's primary range is the Caribbean coastal region of Venezuela, and some have been found in neighboring areas of Colombia and Guyana.\n\nScientists carefully conceal the bird's location to protect them from poachers, but they allowed The Associated Press to photograph a small flock at a secret location in their natural habitat.\n\nCatching sight of them required arriving before dawn, hiding motionless and silently in tall grass thick with mosquitoes under pouring rain. Then, the sun broke through and they swooped in \u2014 a dozen or more \u2014 landing one by one on tangled tree branches overhead, preening and loudly singing.\n\nIn Carayaca, Simon Then, a 53-year-old blue-eyed, blond farmer \u2014 descended from early German settlers \u2014 walks through his family's coffee grove surrounded by dozens of leafy, 5-foot-high shrubs nestled on a steep slope. His eyes fill with emotion showing off the red cherries starting to appear without the use of chemicals.\n\nNo red siskins make this mountainside home yet, but Then envisions the terrain covered in dense forest one day as he and his neighbors join in the effort to restore the endangered bird.\n\n\"It's more work,\" he said about the challenges of organic farming, \"but it gives us more money.\"\n\n___\n\nAP photographer Fernando Llano and AP writer Scott Smith contributed to this report.", "An unusual animal has made its home in New York\u2019s Central Park, dazzling passersby with its vibrant blues, purples, greens, and gold: a Mandarin duck. This creature is far from its homeland \u2013 it\u2019s native to East Asia \u2013 and its presence is both baffling and exciting enthusiasts.\n\nThe duck, a male, was first spotted in Central Park's Pond on Oct. 10. A video of the bird was shared by the Manhattan Bird Alert, a Twitter account run by birder David Barrett that keeps New Yorkers up to date with rare bird sightings and beyond.\n\nThousands of people viewed the footage, many of whom were anxious to catch a glimpse of the rarity themselves. But the following day, the Mandarin duck had vanished.\n\nRoughly two weeks later, the bird returned. This time, the duck \u2013 not to be confused with the North American wood duck \u2013 was spotted at the boat basin on West 79th Street, near the Hudson River. The creature \u201cgot a lot of publicity, but few people got to see it,\u201d Barrett told Fox News on Thursday. \u201cBut then it shows up mysteriously at the boat basin.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, the bird was \u201cnoted again at the Central Park Pond,\u201d he said with enthusiasm.\n\nBut what is perhaps the most exhilarating part of the bird\u2019s story is how it arrived in Manhattan in the first place. Barrett theorized three possibilities, the first being the duck had escaped from a local zoo.\n\n\u201cThe Mandarin duck is not native in the United States at all; it\u2019s a wild bird in East Asia. The only way you would see that duck in our area is at a zoo, and the Central Park Zoo has a Mandarin duck that looks just like this one,\u201d which is why he first thought the facility may have lost the colorful creature, he said.\n\nBut officials with the Central Park Zoo and others in different boroughs have not reported a missing Mandarin duck, Barrett confirmed after placing calls.\n\nThat leaves two other options: either the duck was owned privately \u2013 maybe in neighboring New Jersey or kept illegally as a pet in New York City \u2013 and had escaped or was dumped by an owner who no longer wanted it.\n\n\u201cPerhaps someone had a little duck farm and it escaped,\u201d Barrett suggested, noting the animal was \u201cdefinitely owned because it has a black band around its leg, signifying it was a captive bird.\u201d It's also possible the Mandarin\u2019s owner \u201cgot tired of it and decided to release it in the park,\u201d an occurrence that is not uncommon with exotic pets, Barrett said.\n\nWhile we may never know for sure how the creature arrived, the duck is integrating well with its surrounding wildlife, including mallard ducks \u2014 a Central Park staple.\n\n\u201cDucks have their own community, so this is very important,\u201d he said. \u201cDucks need to work together to protect each other, so we don\u2019t want the others to ostracize it.\u201d But luckily for this duck, \u201cthings are going pretty well. The Mandarin is an aggressive duck and it\u2019s asserting its dominance,\u201d Barrett explained.\n\nWith winter on the way, Barrett expressed concern the duck could possibly die \u2014 not because of cold temperatures, but due to lack of food.\n\n\u201cThere is a risk it could die if the water freezes over,\u201d Barrett said, explaining the Mandarin duck is a \u201cdabbler,\u201d meaning it gets its food by feeding off of insects and vegetation on the pond\u2019s surface.\n\nThankfully, there typically is an open patch of water at the Pond, allowing the bird to find food until spring arrives.\n\nWhile the bird will likely never breed \u2013 there are no female Mandarin ducks currently at the Pond and the male is unlikely to cross-breed \u2013 Barrett said it could theoretically make its home in Central Park for the rest of its life.\n\nIf that's the case, Barrett is all for it.\n\n\u201cIt looks so distinctly different ... it\u2019s breathtaking,\u201d he said.", "bad url", "Try Some Of Our Other Podcasts!", "Play Audio Clip Listen to audio clip.\n\nPlay Audio Clip Listen to audio clip.\n\nHere's what happened today on the Todd Starnes Radio Show:\n\nTodd speaks with Kansas Secretary of State and GOP candidate for governor Kris Kobach about comments made to him by CNN's Jeffrey Toobin.\n\nTodd speaks with RNC Spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany about the races to watch on Election Night.\n\nTodd speaks with NC GOP House candidate Mark Harris about attack ads being run against him featuring his sermons.", "A Long Island family excavating their concrete basement made a grisly discovery this week they hope might give them answers to a nearly six-decade-old mystery.\n\nSuffolk County police said the family, who owns a home in Lake Grove, N.Y., stumbled upon what could possibly be the remains of the home\u2019s long-lost owner.\n\nHomicide Det.

They never received a straight answer from their mother, Dorothy Carroll, on what happened to her father.\n\nDorothy Carroll died in 1998, Newsday reported.\n\nBased on the rumor that his father might be buried in the home, his son Michael Carroll, 57, hired a company with ground-penetrating radar to examine the basement. The family has owned the house since 1955.\n\nBased on those results, Michael Carroll\u2019s sons, both in their 20s, started digging a few months ago, police said.\n\nAround 10 p.m. Tuesday, they found the remains. On Wednesday, they called the police.\n\nMichael Carroll, a respiratory therapist, told Newsday that he had no doubt that the remains were human bones. He believes they are his father\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for my dad because he\u2019s out of there,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve to be in the hole. Now I can give him a decent burial.\u201d\n\nBeyrer said there is no indication that a missing-persons report was ever filed for George Carroll, but it is under investigation. He said the remains were discovered about four to five feet underneath the basement\u2019s concrete floor. DNA tests will determine who the remains belong to, and the medical examiner will work to determine the official cause of death.\n\nHe said the hole may be an old well, which some of the older Carroll children remembered had been covered up by concrete at some point.\n\nAt the moment, there is no indication of foul play and it is unclear who the remains got into the basement hole.\n\nMichael Carroll told Newsday that he was only months old when his father disappeared and only has one photo of him.", "The Latest on developments in Syria (all times local):\n\n5:50 p.m.\n\nSyria's Foreign Ministry is complaining to the U.N. about airstrikes carried out by the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State group citing new mass graves discovered.\n\nThe ministry called on the U.N. secretary-general and the head of the Security Council to force the U.S.-led coalition to stop its airstrikes in Syria.\n\nThursday's statement came a day after a Syrian medical official said a new mass grave was discovered in the northern city of Raqqa that until last year was a stronghold and the de facto capital of IS.

Fernando Hernandez, of Farmington, N.M., initially showed symptoms similar to the flu in January.\n\nA few weeks later he was on life support.\n\nAfter the first symptoms, he spent 10 days at the San Juan Regional Medical Center before he was discharged, only to return on Feb. 10, which was his ninth birthday, because he was having trouble breathing. According to the news outlet, he was then transferred to Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado, where he was later diagnosed with Hantavirus.\n\nAt one point, the boy\u2019s heart nearly stopped and he underwent several surgeries before being hooked up to an Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) machine, which is a device that takes over the duties of the heart and lungs by pumping and oxygenating a person\u2019s blood.

It initially hit the road from Juchitan in southern Mexico before sunrise, hoping to cover ground before temperatures in the area pick up, where it is forecasted to be around 90 degrees later this afternoon.\n\nA Fox News crew traveling with the caravan reports that it originally planned to go to Santa Maria Jalapa del Marques, a city about 35 miles west of Juchitan. But shortly after departing, the caravan's leaders changed the route to go north to the town of Matias Romero, in the direction of the coastal city of Veracruz, which lies on the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe switch suggests that once the caravan gets to Veracruz, it may split in half, with some of the caravan probably heading to a border crossing about 600 miles away in McAllen, Texas. The other half may travel more than double that length to Tijuana, just across the border from San Diego.\n\n\"What's going on right now?

The migrants simply waded across the Suchiate River to get past the police, sometimes in their line of sight.\n\nStunning images have emerged this week capturing the second caravan moving across the river.\n\nIn the first week after the leading caravan got into Mexico, federal police sometimes enforced obscure safety rules, forcing them off paid mini-buses, citing insurance regulations, added the Associated Press. They also stopped some overloaded pickup trucks carrying migrants and forced them to get off.\n\nBut in recent days, officials from Mexico's immigrant protection agency have organized rides for straggling women and children as a humanitarian effort. And police have routinely stood by as migrants piled aboard freight trucks.\n\nAlso Wednesday, a Guatemalan woman gave birth to the first known caravan baby at a hospital in Juchitan.

The system may have been used to transport these stones, according to the archaeologists at French Institute for Oriental Archaeology. And it may have been used to build the Great Pyramid, which is comprised of 2.3 million limestone and granite blocks, the average of which weighs 2.5 tons.\n\n\"This system is composed of a central ramp flanked by two staircases with numerous post holes,\" Yannis Gourdon, co-director of the joint mission told LiveScience. \"Using a sled which carried a stone block and was attached with ropes to these wooden posts, ancient Egyptians were able to pull up the alabaster blocks out of the quarry on very steep slopes of 20 percent or more.\"\n\nMYSTERIOUS 'KEEPER OF THE SECRET' TOMB FOUND IN EGYPT\n\nIn September 2017, researchers found evidence that the limestone used to create the Great Pyramid may have been transported by boat.\n\nThe ropes were attached to the sled and allowed for an easier trip up the ramp, letting the people carrying the heavy slabs in an easier manner, Roland Enmarch, the other co-director of the Hatnub mission, told the news outlet.\n\n\"This kind of system has never been discovered anywhere else,\" Gourdon added. \"The study of the tool marks and the presence of two [of] Khufu's inscriptions led us to the conclusion that this system dates back at least to Khufu's reign, the builder of the Great Pyramid in Giza.\"\n\n\"As this system dates back at least to Khufu's reign, that means that during the time of Khufu, ancient Egyptians knew how to move huge blocks of stone using very steep slopes. Therefore, they could have used it for the construction [of] his pyramid,\" Gourdon said.\n\nAt 481 feet tall, the Great Pyramid is the largest of the three pyramids at Giza. It was built for the pharaoh Khufu, while the other two pyramids were built for pharaohs Khafre and Menkaure, respectively. It's unknown how long it took to build, but researchers believe it was done over a 10 or 20-year period, concluding around 2,560 B.C.\n\nMASSIVE ANCIENT BUILDING DISCOVERED IN EGYPT\n\nAncient Egypt continues to reveal its secrets, including a \"massive\" building that was once part of Egypt\u2019s ancient capital city.\n\nExperts discovered the building, which measures 56 feet by 48 feet, in the town of Mit Rahina, 12 miles south of Cairo. Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, says the building is likely part of the residential block in the ancient Egyptian capital of Memphis.\n\nArchaeologists also recently unearthed an ancient Egyptian tomb, dating back more than 4,000 years, that belongs to a priest named Kaires, the \"sole friend\" of an Egyptian pharaoh yet to be determined.

Authorities deployed paramilitary troops, signaling they could move in to clear the roads.\n\nProtesters, rallied by firebrand cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi, also set up roadblocks and burned tires in the southern port city of Karachi while hundreds of Islamists clashed Thursday with police in various parts of eastern Punjab province.\n\nMany parents kept their children from school, fearing more violence.\n\nThe Islamists also called for the killing of the three judges, including Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, who acquitted Bibi.\n\nThe three are on the hit list of Rizvi's Tehreek-e-Labbaik party, which has demanded a public execution for Bibi. Rizvi has managed to turn out tens of thousands of supporters in the past, often forcing authorities to bow to his demands on religious matters.\n\nTehreek-e-Labbaik claimed Thursday that two of its supporters were killed by police fire during overnight clashes in Karachi. No government official could immediately confirm any casualties.\n\nIn his televised speech, Prime Minister Khan warned the Islamists: \"Let me make it very clear to you that the state will fulfil its responsibility.\"\n\nBibi's lawyer, Saiful Malook, has gone into hiding as the extremists had threatened his life as well.\n\nOn Wednesday, cleric Afzal Qadri, with Rizvi by his side, urged a crowd of supporters outside the Punjab provincial parliament in the city of Lahore to revolt against army chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa and overthrow Khan's government.\n\nBibi's acquittal, however, has been seen as a hopeful sign by Christians in Pakistan, where the mere rumor of blasphemy can spark lynchings. Religious minorities, who have been repeatedly targeted by extremists, fear the law because it is often used to settle scores and to pressure minorities.\n\nIn 2011, Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab, was shot and killed by one of his guards for defending Bibi and criticizing the misuse of the blasphemy law. The assassin, Mumtaz Qadri, was hanged for the crime, but later was hailed by religious hard-liners as a martyr, with millions visiting a shrine set up for him near Islamabad.\n\nShahbaz Bhatti, Pakistan's minister for minorities was also killed in 2011 after he demanded justice for Bibi.\n\nBibi was arrested in 2009 after she was accused of blasphemy following a quarrel with two fellow female farm workers who refused to drink from a water container used by a Christian. A few days later, a mob accused her of insulting Islam's prophet, leading to her 2010 conviction.\n\nBibi's family has always maintained her innocence and says she never insulted the prophet.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Asim Tanveer in Multan, Pakistan, contributed to this report.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nIn a landmark verdict, South Korea's top court on Thursday ruled that people can legally reject mandatory military service on conscientious or religious grounds and must not be punished.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling is expected to affect the cases of more than 900 conscientious objectors on trial, as hundreds of South Koreans, mostly Jehovah's Witnesses, are imprisoned every year for refusing to serve in the military.\n\nAll able-bodied South Korean men must serve about two years in the military under a conscription system aimed at coping with potential aggression from North Korea. The court broke with its own 2004 verdict that rejecting military service because of religious faith was illegal, saying at the time that confrontation with the North made South Korea's draft an indisputable necessity.\n\nThe ruling would be welcome news for those who call for greater individual rights and freedom of opinion in South Korea, though others would criticize it for failing to forget North Korea's threat. When South Korea Constitutional Court ruled in June that the government must introduce alternative social service for conscientious objectors by 2019, a heated debate erupted over whether it's time to come up with such a measure.\n\nOn Thursday, the Supreme Court said it quashed a lower court's ruling that sentenced a conscientious objector to 18 months in prison. It says it ordered the lower court to review its earlier verdict. Supreme Court officials said there is little chance the lower court would not abide by the decision.\n\nThe majority opinion of a panel of Supreme Court judges is that \"conscientious objection of military duty ... can be a valid reason\" to avoid military service, the top court said in a statement.\n\nThe conscientious objector involved in the case, Oh Seung-hun, welcomed the ruling, saying he'll try to conduct an alternative form of civil service.\n\n\"This verdict was possible thanks to the patience of my predecessors and colleagues totaling some 20,000 people,\" Oh told reporters, according to Yonhap news agency. \"I hope there will also be forward-looking and positive rulings in about 930 pending cases too.\"\n\nSouth Korea's Defense Ministry has yet to come up with details on alternative service. In 2007 it had considered allowing conscientious objectors to work in special hospitals and take care of people who had disabilities or dementia.", "Salvadoran President Salvador Sanchez Ceren was due to meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing on Thursday, just months after the small Central American nation broke its diplomatic ties with Taiwan.\n\nThe state visit comes one day before that of the president of the Dominican Republic, whose country also switched allegiances from Taiwan to China this year.\n\nEl Salvador and the Dominican Republic are among a growing number of states who have left Taiwan behind in favor of resuming or establishing relations with China, which considers the self-governing island democracy to be part of its territory.\n\nOnly 17 mainly small, developing countries now recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation. Taiwan split from mainland China amid a civil war in 1949, and Beijing has been steadily ratcheting up diplomatic and economic pressure since Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen took office in 2016.\n\nBeijing's aggressiveness is largely driven by Tsai's refusal to endorse Beijing's \"one-China principle,\" which maintains that Taiwan is part of China and that the Communist Party-ruled administration in Beijing is China's sole legitimate government.\n\nTaiwan has long been a wedge between China and the United States, which has formal relations with Beijing but maintains robust unofficial military and diplomatic links with the island.\n\nWashington's de facto ambassador to Taiwan, Brent Christensen, said Wednesday that the U.S. would be opposed to \"unilateral attempts to change the status quo\" in Taiwan \u2014 a nod to increasing Chinese military intimidation.\n\nChina's wooing of Taiwan's allies in what U.S. considers its backyard has rung alarm bells in Washington.\n\nThe U.S. pulled its diplomatic envoys last month from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic after those countries cut ties with Taiwan.\n\nAt a conference in Washington attended by Salvadoran Vice President Oscar Ortiz last month, Vice President Mike Pence said El Salvador and other Central American countries should strengthen bonds with the U.S. \"even as countries like China tries to expand their influence in the region.\"", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nSri Lanka's president has summoned Parliament to meet next week as pressure grows for him to resolve the turmoil set off when he sacked the Cabinet last week, his chosen prime minister said Thursday.\n\nPresident Maithripala Sirisena made the decision a day after meeting with Parliament Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who previously warned of possible violence if lawmakers were not summoned immediately.\n\nOn Friday, Sirisena had dismissed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his Cabinet, later telling reporters he acted in part because Wickremesinghe and a Cabinet colleague were behind an alleged assassination plot against him. Details of the alleged plot have not been disclosed and Wickremesinghe denies the accusation.\n\nSirisena had replaced him with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa and suspended Parliament until Nov.16 in an apparent attempt to give Rajapaksa time to muster enough support to survive any no-confidence vote.\n\nWickremesinghe had demanded the convening of Parliament, saying he still controls a majority of lawmakers.\n\nSirisena's moves have triggered a power struggle and some observers call it a constitutional crisis.\n\nIn remarks broadcast on state television, Rajapaksa told a meeting at his office that Sirisena decided to summon Parliament on Nov. 5.\n\nSirisena was under increasing pressure by his political opponents, rights groups and foreign governments including the United States to summon parliament and end the crisis.\n\nSirisena's supporters have talked for weeks about an alleged assassination plot, but Sunday was the first time Sirisena commented publicly about it. A police information has said Wickremesinghe and a Cabinet colleague, former army commander Sarath Fonseka, were behind it. Police have made no arrests.\n\nTensions have been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena was also critical of investigations into military personnel accused of human rights violations during Sri Lanka's long civil war, which ended in 2009.\n\nA shooting at the Petroleum Minister on Saturday killed two people and wounded one in the first violence related to the political turmoil.\n\nOn Tuesday, thousands of Sri Lankans protested in the capital demanding Sirisena immediately convene Parliament.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nPalestinians in Gaza have coped with shortages of just about everything in more than a decade of border closures \u2014 from chocolate to medicines to fuel and building supplies. Now, six months of protests against an Israeli-Egyptian blockade have added an unexpected item to that list: car tires.\n\nTires are a favored item by demonstrators during the weekly protests \u2014 they are set on fire, then tossed toward Israeli troops across the border.\n\nIn response, Israel has halted tire imports into the strip, sending prices skyrocketing and forcing Gaza motorists to find creative solutions to keep their vehicles on the road.\n\nTaxi driver Khaled Hamad has no spare tire in his trunk. His tires are worn down, but he could only afford to change two, replacing them with secondhand ones that aren't even the standard size recommended by the manufacturer.\n\n\"Even when they were cheaper, upgrading my tires was expensive,\" Hamad said as he kicked a bald front tire that still needs to be changed. \"I make 40 shekels ($11) a day these days. Business is down.\"\n\nProtesters at the border marches burn old tires, using the thick black smoke to obscure the vision of Israeli snipers as they hurl rocks, firebombs and grenades toward Israeli forces on the other side of the fence diving Gaza and Israel. Flaming tires are also rolled toward the fence.\n\nIronically, the tire ban has had no effect on the protesters, who rely on a seemingly endless supply of old ones that are discarded in garages, fields and roadsides across the territory.\n\nRushdi al-Khour, head of the association of Gaza spare parts merchants, which coordinates imports from Israel, said the tire shortage has caused severe losses for businessmen.\n\nHe said the cost of a pair of tires has jumped from $120 to $300 since the ban went into effect, a sizable sum in the economically struggling strip.\n\nFifteen distributors have lost up to $2 million so far, both in tires they bought from Israeli companies and in storage fees for shipments stuck at Israeli ports, according to al-Khour.\n\n\"This is a wrong decision by the Israeli side,\" he said of the ban. \"Lift the siege and the protests will stop.\"\n\nThe Hamas-led protests have been fueled by widespread despair over the difficult conditions created by the blockade. Unemployment is now over 50 percent, and Gazans get just a few hours of electricity a day.\n\nIsrael and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza after Hamas, a militant group that opposes Israel's existence, took control of the territory in 2007. Israel says the blockade, which restricts the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza, is necessary to isolate Hamas.\n\nAfter coping with shortages of basic items for over a decade, Gazans have become adept at finding creative solutions.\n\nIn the attic of a small workshop in the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza Strip, Abdulla al-Radie invented a rubbery filling for old motor scooter tires that he says extend their lifespan.\n\nHe recently changed the name of his shop to \"Airless Tires Workshop\" and began selling tires he claims cannot be punctured. To demonstrate, he plunged a knife and nails into a tire. He refused to say what the filling is made from, but said it involves five materials, including plastic and rubber.\n\nAt first, the fillings were produced in pipes, but they affected the balance of the wheels. He says he has improved his creation to make \"round molds that fit the shape of the tire and sustain weight.\"\n\nAbout 50 tires were stacked at his shop on a recent day, and he said he sold twice that amount in September. He is now opening a new branch in the southern town of Rafah, where many residents have motorbikes.\n\n\"Today we started with motorcycles,\" he said. \"I hope next we will make them for cars.\"\n\nFadi Diab, who owns a tire store and repair workshop, said he paid about $20,000 to store nine containers of tires stranded at an Israeli port.\n\n\"The prices have gone up and people don't have money,\" he said. \"People come here when changing the tires is their last option. They want to use the tires as long as possible.\"\n\nSome businessmen managed to bring in three shipments of tires from Egypt in October, Diab said. That brought some temporary relief, he said, but sales remain low.\n\nOnly three new tires were seen stacked on a shelf in his shop, while dozens of gleaming metal wheels adorned the wall.\n\n\"Only those who rely on their cars for income ... replace their tires these days,\" Diab added.\n\nHamad, the taxi driver, said he'd change his tires only when prices come down. \"I'm afraid these old tires will keep flattening and affecting my work by delaying me from my customers.\"", "Indonesian navy divers on Thursday recovered the flight recorder of the 2-month-old Lion Air jet that crashed into the sea minutes after takeoff earlier this week, killing all 189 passengers and crew members on board.\n\nTwo navy divers found the flight recorder at the bottom of the Java Sea and swam it to a ship on the surface. The bright orange device was seen on TV being placed inside a large container.\n\n\"I was desperate because the current below was strong but I am confident of the tools given to me,\" said navy 1st Sgt. Hendra, who uses a single name. After narrowing the possible location, \"I started digging and cleaning the debris until I finally found an orange object,\" he said.\n\nSpecial ships and remotely operated underwater vehicles had been deployed following Monday's crash to search for the plane's hull and flight recorders.\n\nThe navy said the aircraft\u2019s fuselage was also seen on the seafloor during recovery of the device, about 1,640 feet northwest of where the plane lost contact with air traffic personnel and at a depth of nearly 100 feet.\n\nThe Boeing 737 MAX 8 plane crashed 13 minutes after taking off. The pilot had requested clearance to return to the airport just 2-3 minutes after departing. Data from flight tracking website FlightRadar24 shows an increase in speed and decrease in altitude at last transmission.\n\nThe plane had reported airspeed indicator problems during a flight the day before the crash. On that flight, the jet displayed unusual variations in altitude and airspeed in the first several minutes of flight, Reuters reported.\n\nWhile the data from flight-tracking sites has been released, safety experts warn that it must be checked against the data from the recovered flight recorder to determine its accuracy.\n\nInvestigators said a preliminary report into the accident could be released within a month but complete findings will take several months more.\n\n\"We will process the data contained in this FDR as part of the investigation process to find out the cause of the crash,\" said Bambang Irawan, an investigator with the National Transport Safety Commission. \"We cannot say how long it takes to process data in a black box, but of course we will try as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe crash marks Indonesia\u2019s worst airline disaster since 1997 and has renewed safety concerns over the country\u2019s quickly expanding aviation industry.\n\nFox News\u2019 Travis Fedschun and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nOne by one, five to a grave, the coffins are buried in the red earth of this ill-kept corner of a South African cemetery. The scrawl on the cheap wood attests to their anonymity: \"Unknown B/Male.\"\n\nThese men were migrants from elsewhere in Africa with next to nothing who sought a living in the thriving underground economy of Gauteng province, a name that roughly translates to \"land of gold.\" Instead of fortune, many found death, their bodies unnamed and unclaimed \u2014 more than 4,300 in Gauteng between 2014 and 2017 alone.\n\nSome of those lives ended here at the Olifantsvlei cemetery, in silence, among tufts of grass growing over tiny placards that read: Pauper Block. There are coffins so tiny that they could only belong to children.\n\nAs people worldwide flee war, hunger and a lack of jobs, global migration has soared to record highs, with more than 258 million international migrants in 2017. That is an increase of 49 percent from the turn of the century, according to the United Nations.\n\nFar less visible, however, has been the toll of this mass migration: The tens of thousands of people who die or simply disappear during their journeys, never to be seen again. A growing number of migrants have drowned, died in deserts or fallen prey to traffickers, leaving their families to wonder what on earth happened to them. At the same time, anonymous bodies are filling cemeteries around the world, like the one in Gauteng.\n\nIn most cases, nobody is keeping track: Barely counted in life, these people don't register in death, as if they never lived at all.\n\nAn Associated Press tally has documented at least 56,800 migrants dead or missing worldwide since 2014 \u2014 almost double the number found in the world's only official attempt to try to count them, by the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration . The IOM toll as of Oct. 1 was more than 28,500. The AP came up with almost 28,300 additional dead or missing migrants by compiling information from other international groups, requesting forensic records, missing persons reports and death records, and sifting through data from thousands of interviews with migrants.\n\nThe AP's tally is still low. Bodies of migrants lie undiscovered in desert sands or at the bottom of the sea. And families don't always report loved ones as missing because they are illegal, or because they left home without saying exactly where they were headed.\n\nThe official U.N. toll focuses mostly on Europe, but even there cases fall through the cracks. The political tide is turning against migrants in Europe just as in the United States, where the government is cracking down heavily on caravans of Central Americans trying to get in. One result is that money is drying up for projects to track migration and its costs.\n\nFor example, when more than 800 people died in an April 2015 shipwreck off the coast of Italy, Europe's deadliest migrant sea disaster, Italian investigators pledged to identify them and find their families. More than three years later, under a new populist government, funding for this work is being cut off.\n\nBeyond Europe, information is even more scarce. Little is known about the toll in South America, where the Venezuelan migration is among the world's biggest today, and in Asia, the top region for numbers of migrants.\n\nThe result is that governments vastly underestimate the toll of migration, a major political and social issue in most of the world today.\n\n\"No matter where you stand on the whole migration management debate....these are still human beings on the move,\" said Bram Frouws, the head of the Mixed Migration Centre , based in Geneva, which has done surveys of more than 20,000 migrants in its 4Mi project since 2014. \"Whether it's refugees or people moving for jobs, they are human beings.\"\n\nThey leave behind families caught between hope and mourning, like that of Safi al-Bahri. Her son, Majdi Barhoumi, left their hometown of Ras Jebel, Tunisia, on May 7, 2011, headed for Europe in a small boat with a dozen other migrants. The boat sank and Barhoumi hasn't been heard from since. In a sign of faith that he is still alive, his parents built an animal pen with a brood of hens, a few cows and a dog to stand watch until he returns.\n\n\"I just wait for him. I always imagine him behind me, at home, in the market, everywhere,\" said al-Bahari. \"When I hear a voice at night, I think he's come back. When I hear the sound of a motorcycle, I think my son is back.\"\n\n_______________________\n\nEUROPE: BOATS THAT NEVER ARRIVE\n\nOf the world's migration crises, Europe's has been the most cruelly visible. Images of the lifeless body of a Kurdish toddler on a beach, frozen tent camps in Eastern Europe, and a nearly numbing succession of deadly shipwrecks have been transmitted around the world, adding to the furor over migration.\n\nIn the Mediterranean, scores of tankers, cargo boats, cruise ships and military vessels tower over tiny, crowded rafts powered by an outboard motor for a one-way trip. Even larger boats carrying hundreds of migrants may go down when soft breezes turn into battering winds and thrashing waves further from shore.\n\nTwo shipwrecks and the deaths of at least 368 people off the coast of Italy in October 2013 prompted the IOM's research into migrant deaths. The organization has focused on deaths in the Mediterranean, although its researchers plead for more data from elsewhere in the world. This year alone, the IOM has found more than 1,700 deaths in the waters that divide Africa and Europe.\n\nLike the lost Tunisians of Ras Jebel, most of them set off to look for work. Barhoumi, his friends, cousins and other would-be migrants camped in the seaside brush the night before their departure, listening to the crash of the waves that ultimately would sink their raft.\n\nKhalid Arfaoui had planned to be among them. When the group knocked at his door, it wasn't fear that held him back, but a lack of cash. Everyone needed to chip in to pay for the boat, gas and supplies, and he was short about $100. So he sat inside and watched as they left for the beachside campsite where even today locals spend the night before embarking to Europe.\n\nPropelled by a feeble outboard motor and overburdened with its passengers, the rubber raft flipped, possibly after grazing rocks below the surface on an uninhabited island just offshore. Two bodies were retrieved. The lone survivor was found clinging to debris eight hours later.\n\nThe Tunisian government has never tallied its missing, and the group never made it close enough to Europe to catch the attention of authorities there. So these migrants never have been counted among the dead and missing.\n\n\"If I had gone with them, I'd be lost like the others,\" Arfaoui said recently, standing on the rocky shoreline with a group of friends, all of whom vaguely planned to leave for Europe. \"If I get the chance, I'll do it. Even if I fear the sea and I know I might die, I'll do it.\"\n\nWith him that day was 30-year-old Mounir Aguida, who had already made the trip once, drifting for 19 hours after the boat engine cut out. In late August this year, he crammed into another raft with seven friends, feeling the waves slam the flimsy bow. At the last minute he and another young man jumped out.\n\n\"It didn't feel right,\" Aguida said.\n\nThere has been no word from the other six \u2014 yet another group of Ras Jebel's youth lost to the sea. With no shipwreck reported, no survivors to rescue and no bodies to identify, the six young men are not counted in any toll.\n\nIn addition to watching its own youth flee, Tunisia and to a lesser degree neighboring Algeria are transit points for other Africans north bound for Europe. Tunisia has its own cemetery for unidentified migrants, as do Greece, Italy and Turkey. The one at Tunisia's southern coast is tended by an unemployed sailor named Chamseddin Marzouk.\n\nOf around 400 bodies interred in the coastal graveyard since it opened in 2005, only one has ever been identified. As for the others who lie beneath piles of dirt, Marzouk couldn't imagine how their families would ever learn their fate.\n\n\"Their families may think that the person is still alive, or that he'll return one day to visit,\" Marzouk said. \"They don't know that those they await are buried here, in Zarzis, Tunisia.\"\n\n______\n\nAFRICA: VANISHING WITHOUT A TRACE\n\nDespite talk of the 'waves' of African migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean, as many migrate within Africa \u2014 16 million \u2014 as leave for Europe. In all, since 2014, at least 18,400 African migrants have died traveling within Africa, according to the figures compiled from AP and IOM records. That includes more than 4,300 unidentified bodies in a single South African province, and 8,700 whose traveling companions reported their disappearance en route out of the Horn of Africa in interviews with 4Mi.\n\nWhen people vanish while migrating in Africa, it is often without a trace. The IOM says the Sahara Desert may well have killed more migrants than the Mediterranean. But no one will ever know for sure in a region where borders are little more than lines drawn on maps and no government is searching an expanse as large as the continental United States. The harsh sun and swirling desert sands quickly decompose and bury bodies of migrants, so that even when they turn up, they are usually impossible to identify.\n\nWith a prosperous economy and stable government, South Africa draws more migrants than any other country in Africa. The government is a meticulous collector of fingerprints \u2014 nearly every legal resident and citizen has a file somewhere \u2014 so bodies without any records are assumed to have been living and working in the country illegally. The corpses are fingerprinted when possible, but there is no regular DNA collection.\n\nSouth Africa also has one of the world's highest rates of violent crime and police are more focused on solving domestic cases than identifying migrants.\n\n\"There's logic to that, as sad as it is....You want to find the killer if you're a policeman, because the killer could kill more people,\" said Jeanine Vellema, the chief specialist of the province's eight mortuaries. Migrant identification, meanwhile, is largely an issue for foreign families \u2014 and poor ones at that.\n\nVellema has tried to patch into the police missing persons system, to build a system of electronic mortuary records and to establish a protocol where a DNA sample is taken from every set of remains that arrive at the morgue. She sighs: \"Resources.\" It's a word that comes up 10 times in a half-hour conversation.\n\nSo the bodies end up at Olifantsvlei or a cemetery like it, in unnamed graves. On a recent visit by AP, a series of open rectangles awaited the bodies of the unidentified and unclaimed. They did not wait long: a pickup truck drove up, piled with about 10 coffins, five per grave. There were at least 180 grave markers for the anonymous dead, with multiple bodies in each grave.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross, which is working with Vellema, has started a pilot project with one Gauteng morgue to take detailed photos, fingerprints, dental information and DNA samples of unidentified bodies. That information goes to a database where, in theory, the bodies can be traced.\n\n\"Every person has a right to their dignity. And to their identity,\" said Stephen Fonseca, the ICRC regional forensic manager.\n\n____________\n\nTHE UNITED STATES: \"THAT'S HOW MY BROTHER USED TO SLEEP\"\n\nMore than 6,000 miles (9,000 kilometers) away, in the deserts that straddle the U.S.-Mexico border, lie the bodies of migrants who perished trying to cross land as unforgiving as the waters of the Mediterranean. Many fled the violence and poverty of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador or Mexico. Some are found months or years later as mere skeletons. Others make a last, desperate phone call and are never heard from again.\n\nIn 2010 the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team and the local morgue in Pima County, Ariz., began to organize efforts to put names to the anonymous bodies found on both sides of the border. The \"Border Project\" has since identified more than 183 people \u2014 a fraction of the total.\n\nAt least 3,861 migrants are dead and missing on the route from Mexico to the United States since 2014, according to the combined AP and IOM total. The tally includes missing person reports from the Colibri Center for Human Rights on the U.S. side as well as the Argentine group's data from the Mexican side. The painstaking work of identification can take years, hampered by a lack of resources, official records and coordination between countries \u2014 and even between states.\n\nFor many families of the missing, it is their only hope, but for the families of Juan Lorenzo Luna and Armando Reyes, that hope is fading.\n\nLuna, 27, and Reyes, 22, were brothers-in-law who left their small northern Mexico town of Gomez Palacio in August 2016. They had tried to cross to the U.S. four months earlier, but surrendered to border patrol agents in exhaustion and were deported.\n\nThey knew they were risking their lives \u2014 Reyes' father died migrating in 1995, and an uncle went missing in 2004. But Luna, a quiet family man, wanted to make enough money to buy a pickup truck and then return to his wife and two children. Reyes wanted a job where he wouldn't get his shoes dirty and could give his newborn daughter a better life.\n\nOf the five who left Gomez Palacio together, two men made it to safety, and one man turned back. The only information he gave was that the brothers-in-law had stopped walking and planned to turn themselves in again. That is the last that is known of them.\n\nOfficials told their families that they had scoured prisons and detention centers, but there was no sign of the missing men. Cesaria Orona even consulted a fortune teller about her missing son, Armando, and was told he had died in the desert.\n\nOne weekend in June 2017, volunteers found eight bodies next to a military area of the Arizona desert and posted the images online in the hopes of finding family. Maria Elena Luna came across a Facebook photo of a decaying body found in an arid landscape dotted with cactus and shrubs, lying face-up with one leg bent outward. There was something horribly familiar about the pose.\n\n\"That's how my brother used to sleep,\" she whispered.\n\nAlong with the bodies, the volunteers found a credential of a boy from Guatemala, a photo and a piece of paper with a number written on it. The photo was of Juan Lorenzo Luna, and the number on the paper was for cousins of the family. But investigators warned that a wallet or credential could have been stolen, as migrants are frequently robbed.\n\n\"We all cried,\" Luna recalled. \"But I said, we cannot be sure until we have the DNA test. Let's wait.\"\n\nLuna and Orona gave DNA samples to the Mexican government and the Argentine group. In November 2017, Orona received a letter from the Mexican government saying that there was the possibility of a match for Armando with some bone remains found in Nuevo Leon, a state that borders Texas. But the test was negative.\n\nThe women are still waiting for results from the Argentine pathologists. Until then, their relatives remain among the uncounted.\n\nOrona holds out hope that the men may be locked up, or held by \"bad people.\" Every time Luna hears about clandestine graves or unidentified bodies in the news, the anguish is sharp.\n\n\"Suddenly all the memories come back,\" she said. \"I do not want to think.\"\n\n________\n\nSOUTH AMERICA: \"NO ONE WANTS TO ADMIT THIS IS A REALITY\"\n\nThe toll of the dead and the missing has been all but ignored in one of the largest population movements in the world today \u2014 that of nearly 2 million Venezuelans fleeing from their country's collapse. These migrants have hopped buses across the borders, boarded flimsy boats in the Caribbean, and \u2014 when all else failed \u2014 walked for days along scorching highways and freezing mountain trails. Vulnerable to violence from drug cartels, hunger and illness that lingers even after reaching their destination, they have disappeared or died by the hundreds.\n\n\"They can't withstand a trip that hard, because the journey is very long,\" said Carlos Valdes, director of neighboring Colombia's national forensic institute. \"And many times, they only eat once a day. They don't eat. And they die.\" Valdes said authorities don't always recover the bodies of those who die, as some migrants who have entered the country illegally are afraid to seek help.\n\nValdes believes hypothermia has killed some as they trek through the mountain tundra region, but he had no idea how many. One migrant told the AP he saw a family burying someone wrapped in a white blanket with red flowers along the frigid journey.\n\nMarta Duque, 55, has had a front seat to the Venezuela migration crisis from her home in Pamplona, Colombia.

Also uncounted are those reported missing in Colombia, Peru and Ecuador. In all at least 3,410 Venezuelans have been reported missing or dead in a migration within Latin America whose dangers have gone relatively unnoticed; many of the dead perished from illnesses on the rise in Venezuela that easily would have found treatment in better times.\n\nAmong the missing is Randy Javier Gutierrez, who was walking through Colombia with a cousin and his aunt in hopes of reaching Peru to reunite with his mother.\n\nGutierrez's mother, Mariela Gamboa, said that a driver offered a ride to the two women, but refused to take her son. The women agreed to wait for him at the bus station in Cali, about 160 miles (257 kilometers) ahead, but he never arrived. Messages sent to his phone since that day four months ago have gone unread.\n\n\"I'm very worried,\" his mother said. \"I don't even know what to do.\"\n\n___________\n\nASIA: A VAST UNKNOWN\n\nThe region with the largest overall migration, Asia, also has the least information on the fate of those who disappear after leaving their homelands. Governments are unwilling or unable to account for citizens who leave for elsewhere in the region or in the Mideast, two of the most common destinations, although there's a growing push to do so.\n\nAsians make up 40 percent of the world's migrants, and more than half of them never leave the region. The Associated Press was able to document more than 8,200 migrants who disappeared or died after leaving home in Asia and the Mideast, including thousands in the Philippines and Indonesia.\n\nThirteen of the top 20 migration pathways from Asia take place within the region. These include Indian workers heading to the United Arab Emirates, Bangladeshis heading to India, Rohingya Muslims escaping persecution in Myanmar, and Afghans crossing the nearest border to escape war. But with large-scale smuggling and trafficking of labor, and violent displacements, the low numbers of dead and missing indicate not safe travel but rather a vast unknown.\n\nAlmass was just 14 when his widowed mother reluctantly sent him and his 11-year-old brother from their home in Khost, Afghanistan, into that unknown. The payment for their trip was supposed to get them away from the Taliban and all the way to Germany via a chain of smugglers. The pair crammed first into a pickup with around 40 people, walked for a few days at the border, crammed into a car, waited a bit in Tehran, and walked a few more days.\n\nHis brother Murtaza was exhausted by the time they reached the Iran-Turkey border. But the smuggler said it wasn't the time to rest \u2014 there were at least two border posts nearby and the risk that children far younger travelling with them would make noise.\n\nAlmass was carrying a baby in his arms and holding his brother's hand when they heard the shout of Iranian guards. Bullets whistled past as he tumbled head over heels into a ravine and lost consciousness.\n\nAlone all that day and the next, Almass stumbled upon three other boys in the ravine who had also become separated from the group, then another four. No one had seen his brother. And although the younger boy had his ID, it had been up to Almass to memorize the crucial contact information for the smuggler.\n\nWhen Almass eventually called home, from Turkey, he couldn't bear to tell his mother what had happened. He said Murtaza couldn't come to the phone but sent his love.\n\nThat was in early 2014. Almass, who is now 18, hasn't spoken to his family since.\n\nAlmass said he searched for his brother among the 2,773 children reported to the Red Cross as missing en route to Europe. He also looked for himself among the 2,097 adults reported missing by children. They weren't on the list.\n\nWith one of the world's longest-running exoduses, Afghans face particular dangers in bordering countries that are neither safe nor welcoming. Over a period of 10 months from June 2017 to April 2018, 4Mi carried out a total of 962 interviews with Afghan migrants and refugees in their native languages around the world, systematically asking a series of questions about the specific dangers they had faced and what they had witnessed.\n\nA total of 247 migrant deaths were witnessed by the interviewed migrants, who reported seeing people killed in violence from security forces or starving to death. The effort is the first time any organization has successfully captured the perils facing Afghans in transit to destinations in Asia and Europe.\n\nAlmass made it from Asia to Europe and speaks halting French now to the woman who has given him a home in a drafty 400-year-old farmhouse in France's Limousin region. But his family is lost to him. Their phone number in Afghanistan no longer works, their village is overrun with Taliban, and he has no idea how to find them \u2014 or the child whose hand slipped from his grasp four years ago.\n\n\"I don't know now where they are,\" he said, his face anguished, as he sat on a sun-dappled bench. \"They also don't know where I am.\"\n\n_____\n\nHinnant reported from Ras Jebel, Tunisia, along with Mehdi El Arem.

That's why the central bank is likely to tread cautiously even though inflation is above the official target, which in theory would warrant higher rates.\n\n\"For the bank's immediate policy decision, near-term Brexit risks are likely to matter more than its expected medium-term outlook for growth and inflation,\" said Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg Bank.\n\nThe central bank's quarterly projections since the Brexit vote in June 2016 have been based on an assumption that the Brexit process would be smooth, that Britain's transition to a new trading relationship with the EU will be orderly. However, after 18 months of discussions, a deal has yet to be reached and fears are growing that one won't be reached given divergent views in particular on how to ensure a hard border does not return between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.\n\nA summit of EU leaders held earlier this month was supposed to be the moment by which to reach a Brexit deal, to give parliaments time to pass it into law ahead of the March departure. Now, officials are talking about a summit in December as potentially the last chance to agree on a Brexit deal. By then, many Britain-based firms may have already activated contingency plans that could include transferring business to the continent and jobs cut.\n\nThis week, credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's warned that Britain faces the prospect of an immediate and prolonged recession, spiking unemployment and inflation if it crashes out of the EU with no deal on future relations and no transition period. Carney will likely face questions on what the central bank anticipates for the British economy in a scenario that would see legal and regulatory uncertainty, border delays and rising tariffs.\n\n\"Given the mounting uncertainty surrounding the negotiations, the bank's 'smooth Brexit' assumption is looking challenged,\" said James Smith, an economist at ING.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nWhen Khalid Arfaoui's friends knocked on his door in May 2011 to signal their departure by boat from Tunisia to Europe, it wasn't fear that held him back, but a lack of cash.\n\nEveryone needed to chip in to pay for the boat, gas and supplies, and he was short about $100. So he sat inside and watched as they left for the beachside campsite where even today locals spend the night before embarking north.\n\nPropelled by a feeble outboard motor and overburdened, the rubber raft flipped, possibly after grazing rocks just offshore.

Two bodies were retrieved, and 11 young men are missing.\n\nAs global migration has soared to record highs, far less visible has been its toll: The tens of thousands of people who die or simply disappear during their journeys, never to be seen again. A growing number of migrants have drowned, died in deserts or fallen prey to traffickers, leaving their families to wonder what on earth happened to them. At the same time, anonymous bodies are filling cemeteries around the world.\n\nIn most cases, nobody is keeping track: Barely counted in life, these people don't register in death, as if they never lived at all.\n\nAn Associated Press tally has documented at least 56,800 migrants dead or missing worldwide since 2014 \u2014 almost double the number found in the world's only official attempt to try to count them, by the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration. The IOM toll as of Oct. 1 was more than 28,500.\n\nThe IOM's research was prompted by two shipwrecks and the deaths of at least 368 people off the coast of Italy in October 2013. It has focused mostly on fatalities in the Mediterranean, although its researchers plead for more data from elsewhere in the world. This year alone, the IOM has found more than 1,900 deaths in the waters that divide Africa and Europe, and more than 17,000 since 2014.\n\nBut even there, many of those who go missing are uncounted, including boatfuls of young Tunisians or Algerians and children whose parents lost track of them in the chaos of land border crossings. In all, The Associated Press found nearly 4,900 people whose families say they simply disappeared without a trace in Europe or en route, including more than 2,700 children whose families reported them missing to the Red Cross.\n\nOf the world's migration crises, Europe's has been the most cruelly visible, with death playing out in videos and photographs. Images of the lifeless body of a Kurdish toddler on a beach, frozen tent camps in Eastern Europe, and a nearly numbing succession of deadly shipwrecks have been transmitted around the world, adding to the furor around migration.\n\nIn the Mediterranean, scores of tankers, cargo boats, cruise ships and military vessels tower over tiny, overcrowded rafts powered by an outboard motor for a one-way trip. Some larger wooden boats carry scores, even hundreds of migrants, but even they may go down when soft breezes turn into battering winds and thrashing waves further from shore.\n\nBut as the political tide in Europe turns against migrants, alive or dead, money is drying up for projects to track migration data and its costs. For example, when more than 800 people died in an April 2015 shipwreck off the coast of Italy, Europe's deadliest migrant sea disaster, Italian investigators pledged to identify them and find their families. More than three years later, under a new populist government, funding for this work has been cut off.\n\nIn the case of Arfaoui's friends, Tunisia's government has no official tally of the missing, and the group never made it close enough to Europe to catch the attention of authorities there. So these migrants never have been counted among the dead and missing.\n\n\"If I had gone with them, I'd be lost like the others,\" Arfaoui said recently, standing on the rocky shoreline with a group of friends, all of whom vaguely planned to leave for Europe. \"If I get the chance, I'll do it. Even if I fear the sea and I know I might die, I'll do it.\"\n\nWith him that day was 30-year-old Mounir Aguida, who had already made the trip once, drifting for 19 hours after the boat engine cut out. In late August this year, he crammed into another raft with seven friends, feeling the waves slam the flimsy bow. At the last minute he and another young man jumped out.\n\n\"It didn't feel right,\" Aguida said.\n\nThere has been no word from the other six \u2014 yet another group of Ras Jebel's youth lost to the sea. With no shipwreck reported, no survivors to rescue and no bodies to identify, the six young men are not counted in any toll.\n\nIn addition to watching its own youth flee, Tunisia and to a lesser degree neighboring Algeria are transit points for other Africans north bound for Europe. Tunisia has its own cemetery for unidentified migrants, as do Greece, Italy and Turkey. On Tunisia's southern coast, one is tended by an unemployed sailor named Chamseddin Marzouk.\n\nOf around 400 bodies interred in the coastal graveyard since it opened in 2005, only one has ever been identified. As for the others who lie beneath mounds of dirt, Marzouk couldn't imagine how their families would ever learn their fate.\n\n\"Their families may think that the person is still alive, or that he'll return one day to visit,\" Marzouk said. \"They don't know that those they await are buried here, in Zarzis, Tunisia.\"", "Students accused of sexual assault will be allowed to cross-examine their accusers, according to new federal rules governing how campus sexual assault cases will be handled.\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos will likely publish the rules this month, with a public comment period to follow, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n\u201cCourts have recognized that cross-examination is an essential part of the process of figuring out the truth in cases where credibility is a factor,\u201d said Joe Cohn, legislative and policy director at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which advocates for more due process for those accused of campus sexual assault.\n\nThe provisions fall under Title IX and will restrict eligible cases to those that occur on campus.\n\nDeVos scrapped Title IX guidance in 2017, preferring to issue her own on the matter.\n\nBut a lawsuit against the Trump administration claims DeVos' decision to lower the standard of evidence used in campus sexual assault cases is motivated in part by sexism.\n\n\u201cWhat you see is that this administration is buying into the sex stereotype that women and girls lie about these types of things, and they\u2019re making policy based on that view,\u201d Karianne Jones, counsel for Democracy Forward Foundation, told the Huffington Post.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Education called the suit baseless and politically motivated.\n\n\u201cShe [Secretary DeVos] and OCR staff met with a number of people on this important issue -- including survivors, falsely accused students, college presidents and university GCs -- and the message was very clear from all of them: We have to get this right on behalf of students and the current process isn\u2019t serving students well,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"[Secretary DeVos] and OCR staff met with a number of people on this important issue ... and the message was very clear from all of them: We have to get this right on behalf of students and the current process isn\u2019t serving students well.\" \u2014 Education Department spokesperson\n\nThe cross-examination rule reflects concerns voiced by some who believe students accused of sexual assault should be given more opportunities to defend themselves.\n\nIn a speech last year, DeVos likened the campus process used to adjudicate sexual assault cases to \"kangaroo courts.\"\n\nDEVOS PLANS TITLE IX CHANGES IN WAKE OF REPORT ON CAMPUS DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS\n\n\u201cSurvivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSurvivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved.\u201d \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\n\nAn Education Department spokesperson declined to comment on the rules before they are published.\n\nAccording to the provision, cross-examination would be mandatory, but questions could be asked through a neutral party and the students could be seated in separate rooms.\n\nQuestions about the accuser's sexual history would not be allowed.\n\nHowever, some worry the new rules could discourage victims from coming forward.\n\n\u201cIf someone tells their story and then they need to be questioned on it, that can be an incredibly invasive and traumatizing experience,\u201d said Anurima Bhargava, an Obama-era Justice Department official who oversaw civil rights enforcement in educational settings.\n\nPresident Trump has voiced concerns about young men accused of sexual misconduct being presumed guilty and subjected to an unfair process.\n\nHe suggested the #MeToo movement targeted young men, calling it a \"very scary time for young men in America\" when \"you can be guilty of something you may not be guilty of.\"\n\nUniversity officials said the Obama-era rules put a hardship on their ability to handle sexual assault cases, with many schools fearing any mistake could result in a federal investigation.\n\nTITLE IX GENDER-DISCRIMINATION CASES GET FASTER REVIEW UNDER TRUMP, DATA SHOW\n\nThe new rules will not contain a definition of gender.

The Road Map entirely lacks a thesis.\"\n\nThe legal analysts argued that the Watergate Road Map could offer insight into the ongoing legal debate as to whether a president constitutionally could be charged with obstruction of justice at all, as well as whether it would be appropriate under the special counsel statutes for Mueller to issue a public or confidential report on his findings -- should he issue a report at all.\n\n\"The document is ... keenly relevant to current discussions of how Mueller should proceed,\" Bates, Goldsmith, and Wittes added. \"It is possible that it is even relevant to discussions taking place within the Mueller investigation itself.\"\n\nThe key takeaways for Mueller, the three legal analysts wrote after reviewing the Watergate Road Map: \"First, less really is more. The document is powerful because it is so spare; because it is trying to inform, not to persuade; because it utterly lacks rhetorical excess.\"\n\nNext: The \"Road Map is extremely careful not to do \u2014 or seem to do \u2014 Congress\u2019s job for it,\" they added. \"[T]he Road Map simply gave Congress information to use as members saw fit and assiduously avoided instruction or didactic messaging as to how to put that information to use.\"\n\nAnd finally: \"The Road Map teaches an important lesson about restraint. ... Leon Jaworski wrote a meticulous 55-page document that contains not a word of excess. He transmitted it to Congress, where it did not leak. It is powerful partly because it is so by-the-book. Kind of like Bob Mueller.\" (Unlike the Starr report, which was written from the prosecutor's perspective, the Watergate Road Map released Wednesday is not written in Jaworski's voice. Instead, it is a court document, like the indictment.)\n\nThe records in the Watergate Road Map initially were provided to Congress under seal 45 years ago, on the order of federal appellate Judge John Sirica, after special prosecutor Jaworski argued he theoretically had enough evidence for criminal charges again Nixon, even though the Constitution seemingly did not permit a sitting president to face a criminal indictment.\n\nFBI NOTIFIED OF ALLEGED SCHEME TO PAY WOMEN TO MAKE FALSE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST MUELLER\n\nSirica authorized the documents' confidential release to Congress in March 1974, after Congress already had initiated impeachment proceedings. Nixon ultimately resigned on Aug. 8, 1974, facing almost-certain impeachment and removal.\n\nThe draft indictment against Nixon contained charges of bribery, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and obstruction of a criminal probe -- and seven Nixon aides who were charged later were similarly hit with obstruction counts.\n\ndocid-70105876 by Fox News on Scribd\n\nThe indictment, which included in the top-right corner a handwritten notation that it was a \"draft,\" read: \u201c[F]rom on or about March 21, 1973\u2026Richard M. Nixon unlawfully, willfully and knowingly did combine, conspire, confederate and agree together and with co-conspirators... to commit bribery... obstruct justice... and obstruct a criminal investigation.\u201d\n\nHowever, prominent legal analysts, including Harvard professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz, as well as the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, have long argued that a sitting president cannot be indicted -- even if he commits a crime.\n\n\"The grand jury was able to discern that Nixon himself was a criminal, and the only reason that they did not indict him is because there was a question of whether or not a sitting president could be indicted,\" University of Virginia Miller Center historian Ken Hughes said in an interview.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle\" exclusively on Monday, President Trump voiced his continued frustration with Mueller's probe, which he has long called a partisan \"witch hunt\" led by Democratic lawyers upset that he had won the 2016 presidential election. However, he also indicated that he might offer some cooperation as the investigation appears to wind down.\n\nCLICK FOR FULL RECAP OF TRUMP-INGRAHAM INTERVIEW\n\n\"It\u2019s ridiculous that I have to do anything, because I didn\u2019t do anything, but yes, we will probably do something, yes we will respond to questions,\" Trump told host Laura Ingraham.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nNorth Korean refugees say sexual violence against women in their former homeland is part of daily life. But a new report suggests there's little chance that abused women in the North will get to say \"MeToo\" anytime soon.\n\nNorth Korea's extremely patriarchal society means many women feel powerless to demand accountability over sexual violence, many are also ashamed of being abused, and some choose to keep silent because of flimsy law enforcement and support systems, according to a report published Thursday by New York-based Human Rights Watch based on interviews with 106 North Koreans who left the country, more than half of them after 2011.\n\nThree women who left North Korea and three South Korean experts, separately interviewed by The Associated Press, agreed that sexual violence is a serious problem in the North, though the voices and economic power of women have gradually increased in recent years because of their role in burgeoning capitalist-style markets. Some said that North Korean women didn't even understand that widespread assaults and harassment were abuse.\n\n\"Sexual violence in North Korea is an open, unaddressed and widely tolerated secret,\" Kenneth Roth, Human Rights Watch's executive director, said in a statement. \"North Korean woman would probably say 'MeToo' if they thought there was any way to obtain justice, but their voices are silenced in Kim Jong Un's dictatorship.\"\n\nThe report comes as U.S.-led global diplomacy focuses on North Korean nuclear disarmament. The country's abysmal human rights status, however, has been largely ignored. It's not the first outside documentation of sexual violence in North Korea, but the report will likely anger North Korea, which often complains about what it claims is persistent U.S. hostility.\n\nKim's propaganda service has called North Korea a \"socialist paradise\" and bristles at outside criticism of its rights conditions as a U.S.-led attempt to force regime change. A 2016 dispatch said every woman in the North is \"highly valued and respected\" and that they \"all can lead a worthwhile life as a heroine of the times.\" But this is also the country that called former female South Korean President Park Geun-hye a \"prostitute.\"\n\nAccording to the report, titled \"You Cry at Night but Don't Know Why,\" and the six people reached by the AP, sexual violence targeting women is rampant in North Korea. They say it happens in detention facilities, open markets, checkpoints, trains, streets and army bases.\n\nThe report details sexual abuse by men in official positions of power, such as prison guards, police officers, prosecutors, soldiers and market supervisors.\n\n\"Interviewees told us that when a guard or police officer 'picks' a woman, she has no choice but to comply with any demands he makes, whether for sex, money, or other favors,\" the report said. \"Women in custody have little choice should they attempt to refuse or complain afterward, and risk sexual violence, longer periods in detention, beatings, forced labor, or increased scrutiny while conducting market activities.\"\n\nOne woman interviewed in the report said a police agent penetrated her several times with his fingers while questioning her illegal stay in China. Another talked about women in a detention center being forced to leave with a guard who raped them every night. They said that \"click, click, click was the most horrible sound\" because it meant the key was turning in the door of their prison cells. Several traders also described male officials at checkpoints conducting intrusive body searches of young women, spending more time checking around their breasts and hips and sometimes underneath their underwear.\n\nOthers in the report said police don't consider sexual violence a \"serious crime\" and that it's \"almost inconceivable\" to even consider going to the police to report their suffering because of possible repercussions. A pervasive social stigma keeps victims silent, the report said, adding that all of the interviewees described \"widespread impunity for perpetrators of sexual violence and lack of justice for survivors.\" They also spoke of deeply embedded patterns of discrimination against women, corruption and a lack of support mechanisms.\n\nWomen who talked to the AP said they didn't even know what exactly sexual abuse was when they were in North Korea.\n\n\"Higher-level male (army officers) often patted female soldiers on their hips and breasts or put their hands underneath their uniforms around their necks when they passed by them. We saw these things lots of times, but we just thought they were specially favored by our bosses,\" said Lee So Yeon, a woman who served in the North's army before her 2008 escape.\n\nA second woman said a detention center guard tried to rape her but moved away after she said her body was crawling with lice. A third woman said sexual abuse was considered shameful for women because people thought they must have brought it on themselves.\n\nThe Human Rights Watch report comes as North Korea struggles to win political and economic concessions from the United States in nuclear negotiations. It's unlikely that the North will take any major steps toward improving its rights conditions because U.S. and South Korean officials don't plan to openly raise the issue during the nuclear talks anytime soon.\n\n\"When we think about the North's horrible rights conditions, I know we should tackle that issue right away but it's also something that we can't resolve overnight,\" said analyst Cho Han Bum at Seoul's Korea Institute for National Unification. If current diplomacy continues, \"the North's rights status at least won't worsen as long as the country continues to open,\" Cho said.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in said Thursday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will \"soon\" visit Seoul as part of a flurry of high-profile diplomacy aimed at ridding North Korea of its nuclear weapons.\n\nDuring a speech before parliament, Moon said that a second North Korea-U.S. summit is \"near at hand\" and that Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to visit North Korea soon. Moon also said he expected Kim to visit Russia soon and that Kim may meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nMoon has previously said that Kim told him he would visit Seoul within this year when the leaders met in Pyongyang in September. South Korea's presidential office said later Thursday that it had nothing to add to Moon's speech about Kim's trip. His comments were in line with previous statements, the Blue House said. They suggest that Moon is determined to push ahead with diplomacy to resolve the nuclear issue.\n\nThe prospects for a second summit between Kim and President Donald Trump improved after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made his fourth visit to North Korea earlier this month. But no breakthrough has followed. U.S. officials have recently said a second Trump-Kim summit will likely happen early next year. Some experts have raised doubts over whether Kim's Seoul trip would be realized by December.\n\nMoon, a liberal who took office last year, favors a negotiated resolution to the decades-long international standoff over North Korea's nuclear ambitions. He has facilitated a series of high-level U.S.-North Korea exchanges, including their first-ever summit in Singapore in June.\n\nBut Moon has faced growing outside skepticism over whether his engagement policy will eventually end the nuclear standoff amid ups and downs in his diplomatic push. Many conservatives in South Korea and the United States say North Korea has no intention of fully giving up its nuclear program and only intends to buy time to perfect its weapons program.\n\nSince entering nuclear talks earlier this year, North Korea has halted nuclear and missile tests and dismantled its nuclear testing site. The United States suspended some of its annual military drills with South Korea, but is reluctant to provide the North with big political or economic benefits unless it takes more serious disarmament steps.", "North Korea leader Kim Jong Un will \"soon\" visit Seoul, South Korea, President Moon-Jae in said Thursday.\n\nMoon revealed the news during a speech on the economy given before parliament. He didn't elaborate on further details.\n\nTRUMP DRAMATICALLY EXPANDS US ESPIONAGE SPENDING AMID THREATS FROM RUSSIA, CHINA AND NORTH KOREA\n\nThe two Korean leaders announced in September that Kim had accepted Moon's invitation to visit Seoul, but it was unclear when.\n\nKim said he promised Moon he would visit the capital \"in a short time.\" Moon then said Kim agreed to visit Seoul within the year unless there are \"exceptional circumstances.\"\n\nIf Kim does visit, he would be the first North Korean leader to visit the South Korean capital since the 1950-1953 Korean War ended in a cease-fire.\n\nKim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, became the first member of the ruling Kim family to visit Seoul in February, when she attended the Winter Olympics in South Korea as a special envoy and conveyed Kim's desire for a summit with Moon.\n\nNORTH KOREA PREPARING TO LET INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS VISIT NUCLEAR SITE, REPORT SAYS\n\nMoon on Thursday also said that a second summit between North Korea and the U.S. is \"near at hand,\" adding that Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to visit North Korea and that Kim is to travel to Russia soon.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "", "Japan's central government has resumed work at a disputed U.S. military base relocation site on the southern island of Okinawa despite local opposition.\n\nThe Defense Ministry's local branch said an early stage of landfill work at Henoko on Okinawa's east coast began Thursday morning.\n\nThe Henoko site is the replacement for a U.S. Marine Corps air station in a more populated area.\n\nOkinawans say the presence of so many U.S. troops on the tiny island is burdensome and they want the base off the island entirely.\n\nDefense Ministry officials said the resumption of work at Henoko followed the central government's decision earlier this week to reverse Okinawa's earlier ban on a landfill work at the site.\n\nAbout half of the 50,000 American troops in Japan are stationed on Okinawa.", "How can you tell whether the economy is truly surging under President Trump? Just listen as the Democrats try to take at least some credit for the current economic boom.\n\nFor example, President Obama pleads with us to \u201cremember who started\u201d this economic boom. Former Obama administration economist Austin Goolsby attempts to credit both presidents, claiming that Obama handed Trump \u201csome of the best economic conditions for a new president in a half century.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The economy is booming because President Trump reversed President Obama\u2019s economic policies \u2013 not because Trump furthered the Obama policies.\n\nPresident Obama raised taxes on businesses and individuals. He expanded the federal government\u2019s size and power through dramatic increases in the number and scope of federal regulations. He discouraged domestic energy production \u2013 for example, refusing to authorize the Keystone XL pipeline and openly attempting to bankrupt the coal industry.\n\nThe economy is now booming because President Trump took the opposite course. President Trump has dramatically cut both taxes and regulations \u2013 shrinking the government\u2019s size and power \u2013 while aggressively encouraging domestic energy production.\n\nIt was Hillary Clinton \u2013 not Donald Trump \u2013 who committed to continue the Obama\u2019s economic policies. Had Clinton become president, we would be experiencing the same anemic economic growth we experienced under the Obama administration.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s post-recession gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged an anemic 2.1 percent. In his last year in the White House, GDP grew at a pathetic 1.5 percent \u2013 hardly creating what Goolsby described as \u201csome of the best economic conditions for a new president in a half century.\u201d\n\nThe differences between the Obama and Trump economic policies couldn\u2019t be clearer. It\u2019s like a baseball team firing a manager with a poor winning percentage whose strategy was based on speed and hiring a manager who replaces all of the team\u2019s players, switches to a power strategy and wins the World Series.\n\nNo one would credit the fired manager with the World Series win \u2013 at least not rationally.\n\nIs the current economic surge like winning the World Series? Let\u2019s look.\n\nThe economy is booming because President Trump reversed President Obama\u2019s economic policies \u2013 not because Trump furthered the Obama policies.\n\nThe unemployment rate in September stood at 3.7 percent, the lowest rate since 1969. Not coincidentally, for the week ending Oct. 15, initial claims for unemployment benefits were the lowest since 1973, when the U.S. population was 110 million people smaller. This is because the Trump economy\u2019s job creation numbers are regularly beating expectations \u2013 averaging over 208,000 jobs per month so far this year.\n\nWill hiring continue to increase, causing the number of workers forced onto the unemployment rolls to continue its decline? Yes, it will.\n\nThere are currently more job openings than people unemployed. Last March was the first time that had happened since the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) began compiling the data. It has happened every month since.\n\nIn August, there were 7.1 million job openings \u2013 the highest number ever recorded \u2013 with only 6.2 million people unemployed. In other words, there were 900,000 more job openings than people who had looked for a job in the past 30 days. Again, a remarkable record.\n\nWho is benefitting? Is it, as Democrats claim, only the rich who benefit from tax cuts and economic growth? No. People are benefitting across demographics regardless of race, sex or level of education. Unemployment rates are at or near record lows for African- Americans, Hispanics, Asians, women and people without high school diplomas.\n\nThe BLS announced Wednesday that the wages and salaries of American workers in the third quarter of this year were 3.1 percent higher than during the same period one year ago \u2013 the biggest increase in 10 years.\n\nDuring the Obama era, wage increases never reached 3 percent in a 12-month period. One of the problems was too many people working part-time in the Obama years.\n\nIn the Trump years, the number of people working part-time because they are unable to find full-time jobs has dropped by 1.2 million, while the number of people working full-time has increased by 4.3 million. On top of the wage increases, benefits increased 2.6 percent. Perhaps more importantly, thanks to the Republican tax cuts, workers take-home pay has increased even more significantly at about 5 percent.\n\nConsequently, workers are making more money and taking home a larger percentage of what they earn. It should come as no surprise that the Conference Board recently reported that its consumer confidence index had climbed from 135.3 in September to 137.9 in October. Both readings are the highest in 18 years.\n\nThat confidence is, in turn, driving consumer spending. This spending has increased every month since April, following the Internal Revenue Service lowering withholding rates \u2013 thanks to the Republican tax cuts.\n\nWith consumer spending driving over two-thirds of GDP growth, we are finally seeing the kind of growth in the GDP that we should have seen under President Obama and coming out of the recession.\n\nWe are averaging 3.3 percent GDP growth year to date with GDP growth coming in at 4.2 percent in the second quarter and 3.5 percent in the third.\n\nIt\u2019s early, but the Atlanta Federal Reserve is projecting over 2.6 percent growth for fourth quarter. If true (and I believe that estimate is low), GDP growth would be 3.1 percent for 2018, making it the first year since 2005 with 3 percent or better GDP growth.\n\nIf the projection is correct, Obama would be the only post-World War II president without a single calendar year of at least 3 percent GDP growth. In fact, the economy is so strong that the Federal Reserve Bank has had enough confidence to raise interest rates seven times since the election and will raise them an eighth time in December.\n\nHigher interest rates create demand for interest-bearing instruments \u2013 like bonds \u2013 and decrease the demand for stocks, driving prices down. Nonetheless, and despite the recent ups and downs in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, it remains up over 35 percent.\n\nThat is a huge testament to the economy\u2019s strength. During the entire Obama era \u2013 prior to the 2016 election \u2013 the Fed only had enough confidence in the economy to raise interest rates once (in December 2015) and then only by one quarter of 1 percent.\n\nObama era economic experts expected better. In 2010, the Obama White House forecast that GDP growth would \u201caccelerate in 2011 to 3.8%\u201d and \u201cexceed 4% per year in 2012-2014.\u201d Why? Well, it would have been consistent with the 4.3 percent growth rate in the prior 10 post-World War II recoveries.\n\nIt may well have seemed that the economic momentum coming out of a deep recession would be so powerful that it would compel dynamic economic growth despite President Obama\u2019s anti-business policies. Of course, it didn\u2019t, and that momentum never materialized \u2013 at least until President Trump implemented pro-business and pro-growth economic policies.\n\nFollowing the 2016 election, Obama economists initially tried blaming structural problems for his failure to generate better economic growth. They also were quick to demean the Trump administration\u2019s 3 percent GDP growth forecasts.\n\nA February 2017 Business Insider article discussing 3 percent GDP growth quoted former Obama administration economist Lee Branstetter as stating that \u201cit's essentially mathematically impossible to get the growth they're talking about.\u201d\n\nIn March, economist and Obama administration alum Jason Furman blamed changed economic circumstances and forecast 10 years of GDP growth \u201caround 2 percent a year.\u201d\n\nIn May, fellow Obama economist Larry Summers, compared believing in the Trump administration\u2019s forecast of 3 percent GDP growth to believing \u201cin tooth fairies.\u201d\n\nWell, when it comes to whether Trump\u2019s economic policies will finally generate the level of economic growth we should have been seeing since the recession ended, I\u2019m a believer.", "Willie McCovey, one of the best left-handed hitters ever to play baseball, has died, the San Francisco Giants announced Wednesday. He was 80 years old.\n\nIn a Twitter post, the Giants -- with whom McCovey spent 19 of his 22 major league years -- said the former first baseman and left fielder \"passed away peacefully\" on Wednesday afternoon. No cause of death was given, but the team said McCovey had been struggling with ongoing health issues.\n\nMcCovey's daughter Allison told KTVU her father \"passed peacefully surrounded by his family and friends while listening to his favorite sports channel.\"\n\nMcCovey had used a wheelchair to get around in recent years but was still a regular at San Francisco's AT&T Park, where he watched Giants games from a private suite.

Despite appearing in just 52 games, the 21-year-old batted .354 with 13 home runs, 38 RBIs and a 1.085 on-base plus slugging percentage. It was good enough for him to be named the NL Rookie of the Year in a unanimous vote.\n\nMARYLAND FIRES FOOTBALL COACH IN SUDDEN REVERSAL AFTER OUTCRY\n\n\"You knew right away he wasn't an ordinary ballplayer,\" said fellow slugger Hank Aaron, courtesy of the Hall of Fame. \"He was so strong, and he had the gift of knowing the strike zone. There's no telling how many home runs he would have hit if those knees weren't bothering him all the time and if he played in a park other than Candlestick.\"\n\nThree years later, McCovey came as close as he ever would to winning a championship. With runners at second and third and two outs, the man nicknamed \"Stretch\" came to the plate with the Giants trailing the New York Yankees 1-0 in the seventh and deciding game of the 1962 World Series. McCovey smoked a line drive off the Yankees' Ralph Terry --only to watch helplessly as New York second baseman Bobby Richardson snagged it.\n\nTwo months later, \"Peanuts\" cartoonist and Northern California resident Charles Schulz put the words of millions of Giants fans and Yankee haters into the mouth of his most beloved creation.\n\nCLEVELAND BROWNS FIRE COACH HUE JACKSON\n\n\"Why couldn't McCovey have hit the ball just three feet higher?\" asked Charlie Brown in the Dec. 22, 1962 edition of the comic strip.\n\n\"I still think about it all the time,\" McCovey said in October 2014, after the Giants had won their third World Series in five seasons. \"I still think, 'If I could have hit it a little more.'\"\n\nIn 1969, McCovey narrowly beat out New York Mets pitcher Tom Seaver for the National League MVP. McCovey led the NL in home runs (45) and RBIs (126) for the second straight year, batting .320 while also posting NL-bests with a .453 slugging percentage and .656 on-base percentage. He was walked 121 times, then drew a career-high 137 free passes the next season. He had been third in the 1968 MVP voting, but would never finish higher than ninth after 1969.\n\nA six-time All-Star who also played for the San Diego Padres and Oakland Athletics, McCovey finished his career with 521 home runs, the same number as another great left-handed hitter: Ted Williams. McCovey also drove in 1,555 runs and boasted a career .270 batting average.\n\nMcCovey was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986, his first year of eligibility. He had spent the last 18 years in a senior advisory role with the Giants, who renamed a section of San Francisco Bay McCovey Cove when the team moved to its waterfront home ballpark prior to the 2000 season.\n\n\"Every moment he will be terribly missed,\" said McCovey's wife, Estella. \"He was my best friend and husband.
