Beto O\u2019Rourke is a winner, regardless of whether or not he pulls off a shock victory over Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cWin or lose, Beto O\u2019Rourke set to emerge victorious,\u201d Reuters\u2019 tweeted from its verified account, adding a link to the news gathering service\u2019s Election Day coverage and a nearly two-minute, slickly produced video declaring O'Rourke victorious...one way or another.\n\nO'Rourke's \u201cbreakout bid\u2026has dominated the 2018 elections like no other race,\u201d says the video's narrator, who is not identified, before the clip cuts to a crowd chanting: \u201cBeto, Beto, Beto!\u201d\n\nThe narration continues: \u201cPolitical veterans say if the skateboarding El Paso congressman even comes close over arch-conservative Cruz, his political future will just be taking off.\u201d\n\nReuters political reporter Tim Reed, who's assigned to cover O\u2019Rourke, then addresses viewers directly.\n\n\u201cEven if Beto O\u2019Rourke loses his Senate bid, he still emerges a winner, as does the Texas Democratic Party,\" Reed says. \"I\u2019ve traveled to Texas a couple of times in recent weeks and the energy surrounding his campaign has been huge. He\u2019s been drawing crowds in Texas that no Democrat has drawn for many, many years.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the clip fawns over O\u2019Rourke\u2019s savvy social media operation and his supposed ability to rack up a massive war chest \u201cwhile refusing to take outside money,\u201d in the state of Texas where \u201cRegistered Republicans still outnumber Democrats by hundreds of thousands.\u201d That claim, however, is in some dispute, and even Politifact has labeled it \"half true.\"\n\nReed labels O'Rourke a \u201cnational phenomenon,\u201d noting his campaign buttons and shirts are popping up nationwide \u2013 not just in Texas.\n\n\u201cWhile he has dismissed talk of a future White House bid, many people in the Democratic Party would love him to run,\u201d Reed says as the profile concludes.\n\nReuters has tweeted the same video with a variety of messages including: \u201cDemocrat Beto O'Rourke has put up a strong fight in Texas that could reverberate well beyond Election Day.\u201d In another post, the news service says O'Rourke has \"dominated\" the midterm conversation.\n\nO\u2019Rourke has emerged as a darling of the liberal media and CNN declared him a help to Democrats \u2013 regardless of whether or not he defeats Cruz \u2013 back in August. He\u2019s also been labeled a \u201crising star,\u201d \u201crock star\u201d and MSNBC\u2019s Peter Alexander recently pondered if O\u2019Rourke could be the 2020 presidential nominee even if he loses his bid for a Senate seat on Tuesday,", "Italy said Tuesday that it is working to help relocate the family of a Pakistani Christian woman acquitted eight years after being sentenced to death for blasphemy, amid warnings from her husband that the family's life is in danger in Pakistan.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry said it was coordinating with other countries to ensure safety for Asia Bibi and her family. In a statement, the ministry said it was ready to act on whatever the Italian government might decide \u2014 an indication that an offer of asylum might be in the offing.\n\nAlso Tuesday, a lawmaker in German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party called for Germany to grant Bibi refuge, after her husband Ashiq Masih appealed for help from the West to relocate the family.\n\nBibi was convicted in 2010 of insulting Islam's prophet, but Pakistan's top court acquitted her last week. Protests by hardline Islamists prompted the government to impose a travel ban on Bibi until her case is reviewed.\n\nBibi's case has been closely followed in Italy for years, and Pope Francis met earlier this year with her family in a show of solidarity.\n\nEven Italy's hardline, anti-migrant interior minister Matteo Salvini stressed that he would do \"all that is humanly possible\" to ensure Bibi and her family are safe, either in Italy or some other country.\n\nSalvini distinguished between Bibi and the tens of thousands of migrants who try to seek out a better life in Italy via smugglers' boats from Libya.", "", "", "", "", "", "Democrats reclaimed control of the House of Representatives Tuesday night after eight long years out of power, dealing a major setback to President Trump's legislative agenda -- but Republicans were able to expand their narrow Senate majority and, with it, preserve the ability to confirm crucial judicial nominees.\n\nThe split decision on Capitol Hill follows one of the most intense and chaotic midterm campaign seasons in recent memory, in which President Trump barnstormed the country for GOP candidates and powerful Democrats, including predecessor Barack Obama, did the same for the other side.\n\nFor his part, Trump was able to help prevent a total Democratic takeover in Congress, and he avoided a repeat of President Obama's first midterm elections in 2010, when his party lost 6 seats in the Senate and 63 in the House.\n\nRetiring House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., said in a statement that \"history had repeated itself\" Tuesday night, noting that since 1862, the president's party has lost an average of 32 House seats during the midterms. After Tuesday's elections, Democrats appeared poised to gain approximately two dozen seats in the House, while Republicans looked to net at least two Senate seats.\n\n\"I'm proud of the campaign that our members and candidates ran in a challenging political environment,\" he said.\n\nThe president reacted positively but tersely to the results late Tuesday, writing on Twitter, \"Tremendous success tonight. Thank you to all!\" Hours later, he quoted author Ben Stein, said that \"there\u2019s only been 5 times in the last 105 years that an incumbent President has won seats in the Senate in the off year election\" and that Trump \"has magic about him.\"\n\nIn a boost for Trump, the GOP's continued hold on the Senate gives Republicans control over all critical federal judicial appointments, including nominations to the Supreme Court. Republicans flipped a number of marquee Senate seats on Tuesday, with wins by Josh Hawley over Sen. Claire McCaskill in Missouri, Rep. Kevin Cramer over Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, Republican Gov. Rick Scott over longtime Sen. Bill Nelson in Florida, and Mike Braun over Joe Donnelly in Indiana.\n\nAll four of those ousted Democrats opposed the confirmation of Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanuagh, who was besieged by uncorroborated -- and in some cases discredited -- allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nAnd GOP Sen. Ted Cruz also held off a well-funded insurgent challenge from Beto O'Rourke in Texas by a slim margin. (In a sign that Texas remains deeply conservative overall, popular GOP Gov. Greg Abbott defeated Democrat Lupe Valdez by more than 14 points.)\n\n\"With gains in the Senate, Republicans defied history, an achievement reached only four times in history,\u201d Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said, adding that the GOP had turned Democrats' \"tsnumani into a ripple.\"\n\nBut Democrats' win in the House gives fresh hope to liberals who want to investigate and perhaps even impeach the president. The takeover in that chamber ensures a contentious next two years leading into the 2020 presidential elections.\n\n\"With gains in the Senate, Republicans defied history, an achievement reached only four times in history.\" \u2014 RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel\n\nDemocrats will also be able to halt many items on Trump's legislative wishlist, including funding for his proposed border wall and a new middle-class tax cut -- or at least extract major concessions on issues like immigration reform before Trump gets his way.\n\nAlthough the exact size of the parties' respective majorities in the House and Senate is not clear, Democrats will soon have to decide whether to restore Nancy Pelosi to her old job as speaker of the House, which she held from 2007 to 2011.\n\n\"We will have a Congress that is open transparent and accountable to the American people,\" Pelosi said Tuesday night. \"We will work for the boldest common denominator.\"\n\n\u201cTomorrow will be a new day in America,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have all had enough of division. The American people want peace. They want results.\u201d\n\nThe midterms, Pelosi said, were primarily about \u201crestoring the Constitution\u2019s checks and balances to the Trump administration.\"\n\nPreviewing an adversarial relationship with the White House even as she said Democrats \"strive for unity,\" Pelosi charged that Republicans are becoming \"more destructive every day\" and are bent on enriching the wealthy.\n\nPelosi and top Democrats have vowed to open a series of investigations into the White House upon reclaiming the House, including probes into Trump's unreleased personal tax returns, alleged collusion with Russia, and potential ethics violations by administration officials.\n\n\"We will work for the boldest common denominator.\" \u2014 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\nProminent firebrands including Democratic Reps. Maxine Waters, Adam Schiff, and Jerry Nadler are slated to be elevated to lead the House Financial Services Committee, Intelligence Committee, and Judiciary Committee, respectively. With control of those and other key committees, Democrats will have the legal authority to issue subpoenas to compel Republicans and others to provide documents or appear at hearings -- and to seek contempt proceedings if they don't comply.\n\n\"We will be able to get answers the Republicans were unwilling to pursue,\" Schiff told CNN in October. \"Records that the Republicans wouldn't ask for.\" (Pelosi has said that trying to obtain Trump's tax returns would be \"one of the first things we'd do.\")\n\nSchiff added that he would place a \"very high priority\" on determining whether the Trump Organization had laundered money through Russia.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, defied expectations of a blue wave largely on the strength of several major wins in the Senate. Cruz sealed the result with his defeat of O\u2019Rourke in the most expensive Senate race in American history.\n\nThe 46-year-old O'Rourke, who had sought to become the first Democrat to win a statewide race in Texas since 1994, set fundraising records by taking in $70 million last quarter alone. He launched his campaign on a promise of bipartisanship and unity that contrasted sharply with Cruz's strongly conservative record.\n\nBut O'Rourke's policy proposals -- including impeaching President Trump, adopting an expensive \"Medicare-for-all\" program, and potentially abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), agency -- alienated many voters in Texas' conservative strongholds.\n\nAnd Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley took down vulnerable incumbent Democratic Sen. McCaskill, whose appeal in a state Trump carried by double digits in 2016 faded as she voted against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. On Monday, McCaskill, who has presented herself as a moderate, claimed she \"didn't care\" which party won the Senate.\n\n\"Obviously we fell short, and that is disappointing,\" McCaskill said Tuesday night. \"I feel pain for people who said they're going to do more than sit on the couch and cuss the TV.\"\n\nBETO BLOCKER: CRUZ TRUMPS O'ROURKE, WHO BROUGH IN RECORD-HIGH CAMPAIGN DONATIONS\n\nThe Fox News Decision Desk also assesses that Cramer will unseat one-term Democratic Sen. Heitkamp in North Dakota, scoring a crucial Senate pickup for the GOP. Heitkamp, who had long struggled against Cramer in the reliably red state, may have sealed her political fate last month when she also opposed Kavanaugh's confirmation.\n\nIn Indiana, Mike Braun, a businessman, will defeat first-term Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, another Democrat whose vote against Kavanaugh proved costly. The race was one of the most closely fought races in the country, and Braun's victory marks another big win for the GOP. Trump had aggressively campaigned for Braun in recent days.\n\nFULL MIDTERM RESULTS\n\nIn another key race for Republicans, the Fox News Decision Desk projects that Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn will defeat former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen to replace retiring GOP Sen. Bob Corker. While Blackburn spent all summer trailing Bredesen in the polls, she closed the gap and took the lead about a month ago, despite a last-minute endorsement by pop star Taylor Swift for Bredesen.\n\nTAYLOR FADE: SWIFT'S ENDORSEMENT SOUNDS SOUR NOTE AFTER BREDESEN GOES DOWN\n\nFormer Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney will also defeat Democrat Jenny Wilson to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch, as expected. The former Massachusetts governor, previously a fierce Trump critic, secured his support after backing his presidency.\n\nDemocrats also saw some expected, but significant, Senate wins. New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez will win re-election by defeating Republican businessman Bob Hugin. And the Fox News Decision Desk also projects that West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin will win re-election by defeating Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Manchin was the only member of his party to vote to confirm Kavanaugh. In Michigan, Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow will win a fourth term by defeating Republican businessman John James, a combat veteran who was strongly backed by President Trump, Fox News projects.\n\nThe Fox News Decision Desk also projects that none of the four candidates in Mississippi's special Senate election will win tonight because none garnered 50 percent of the vote. The top two finishers \u2013 Republican incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democratic challenger Mike Espy -- will face each other in a runoff election on Nov. 27.\n\nA number of other key races remain too close to call, including the contest between Montana incumbent Sen. Jon Tester and Republican challenger Matt Rosendale, the state auditor. President Trump has made it his mission to defeat Tester, who helped torpedo Trump\u2019s nomination of White House physician Ronny Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. At this moment, Tester has fallen behind in the race.\n\nIn Nevada, Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen will defeat incumbent Republican Sen. Dean Heller, cutting into the GOP's gains in the Senate. Heller was widely regarded as one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress.\n\nThe Fox News Decision Desk also cannot yet project a winner in Arizona, where Republican Rep. Martha McSally is in a tight battle with Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. Determining the winner could take days.\n\nDemocrats were able to regain the majority in the House by flipping key seats; they needed to take 23 for a majority. In Northern Virginia's 10th Congressional District, GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock is projected to lose to her Democratic challenger, state Sen. Jennifer Wexton. Comstock was widely seen as one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress.\n\nAnd 77-year-old Democrat Donna Shalala, who served as Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Bill Clinton, has defeated Republican opponent Maria Elvira Salazar in Florida's 27th Congressional District, which has long been held by the GOP.\n\nDemocrat Joe Cunningham pulled off an upset by defeating Katie Arrington in in South Carolina's 1st Congressional District, which Republicans have held since 1981.\n\nSome major Democratic efforts to flip Republican-controlled seats came up short. In Kentucky's 6th Congressional District, Republican incumbent Rep. Andy Barr has defeated Democrat Amy McGrath. The two had been competing in a neck-and-neck race, which Democrats saw as an opportunity to flip a seat in a GOP-leaning district. McGrath, the first female Marine to fly an F/A-18 on a combat mission, campaigned on a largely anti-Trump platform.\n\nAnd Republican Denver Riggleman has defeated Democrat Leslie Cockburn to keep a closely watched Virginia congressional seat in the hands of the GOP. Virginia's 5th Congressional District is home to incumbent GOP Rep. Tom Garrett, who announced that he would not seek re-election earlier this year amid mounting scandals. While the district supported President Trump in 2016 by double-digits, the contest had been tight between Cockburn, a former journalist who favors Medicare-for-all, and Riggleman, a staunch Republican.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fox News Decision Desk projects that Democratic Sens. Sen. Tim Kaine in Virginia, Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts, and Sherrod Brown in Ohio, as well as Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, will all cruise to victory.\n\nWATCH: COMSTOCK SAYS THREAT TO IMPEACH KAVANAUGH IS 'RIDICULOUS'\n\nDemocrat and former CIA officer Abigail Spanberger also defeated Tea Party-affiliated Republican Rep. Dave Brat, who has represented the state's 7th Congressional District since 2014, when he stunned the nation by unseating then-House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor.\n\nTrump carried this district by 7 points in 2016, and it has had a Republican representative for almost 50 years. But changing demographics put it in play and led to Spanberger's win.\n\nFox News' Bill Sammon and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "Vehicular homicide charges were filed Tuesday against a 21-year-old man accused of inhaling chemical vapors before he crashed his truck into a group of Girl Scouts picking up trash along a highway, killing three children and one adult, Wisconsin prosecutors said Tuesday.\n\nThe 11 charges filed against Colten Treu include four counts of vehicular homicide and four counts of a hit-and-run resulting in death. The punishment for those charges alone is up to 160 years in prison.\n\nThe criminal complaint prosecutors released describe a struggle for the steering wheel between Treu and the passenger in his truck shortly before the vehicle veered off the road and struck the Girl Scout troop working in ditches along the highway in Lake Hallie, a town about 95 miles (152 kilometers) east of Minneapolis. Treu and his passenger later told investigators they had been huffing from a computer keyboard cleaner they'd purchased that day.\n\nThe Saturday crash killed 9-year-old Jayna Kelley and 10-year-old Autum Helgeson, both of Lake Hallie, and 10-year-old Haylee Hickle and her mother, 32-year-old mother, Sara Jo Schneider, from the Town of Lafayette.\n\nA sheriff's deputy investigating the accident traced a fluid trail that led to the house where Treu lived with the truck's passenger, according to the complaint. The passenger, who has not been arrested or charged, told police he grabbed the steering wheel when he saw that Treu \"looked out of it\" and that the truck was crossing over the road's center line. The passenger said Treu yelled at him for touching the steering wheel before crossing the center line again, this time going into the ditch, according to the complaint.\n\nTreu is being held on $250,000 bond.\n\nTreu told investigators he never passed out and that his passenger \"was huffing a lot more than him,\" according to the complaint. He said he \"lost control of the vehicle and fishtailed\" after his passenger grabbed the steering wheel.\n\nThe other charges Treu faces are for felony bail jumping, intentionally abusing a hazardous substance, and causing \"great bodily harm\" during a hit-and-run because another Girl Scout in the group was injured.\n\nTreu was previously convicted of drunken-driving in Wisconsin and he was currently out on bail for another accident in September, when he was charged with driving his employer's car into a ditch while intoxicated.\n\nJudy Schneider, the mother of Sara Jo Schneider and Haylee's grandmother, told The Associated Press in an interview Monday that after the crash she wondered, \"What was the driver thinking?\"\n\n\"And my first thought was, 'Let's just prosecute the hell out of him.' And then what? Do they come back? And now that I hear his history, I understand addiction. But I just don't know how the hatred and anger is going to help at this point.\"", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nThe judge who is the most prominent face of Brazil's anti-corruption campaign denied Tuesday that his appointment as justice minister was a reward for having convicted and jailed a political rival of his new boss.\n\n\"This has nothing to do with the case of ex-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva,\" Judge Sergio Moro told reporters at his first news conference since accepting the nomination. \"I know that some interpreted my nomination as a reward. That is not the case.\"\n\nMoro is both celebrated and loathed in Brazil for his role in the \"Car Wash\" investigation, which jailed dozens of business leaders and politicians who participated in schemes to trade public contracts and favors for kickbacks and bribes.\n\nThe most prominent is da Silva, whose conviction resulted in him being barred from seeking another term this year, paving the way for President-elect Jair Bolsonaro's victory.\n\nMany credit the hard-charging judge with ending a culture of impunity, but others feel the probe has focused too much on da Silva's leftist Workers' Party, while giving less attention to politicians on the right.\n\nThose complaints have grown since Moro accepted a position in President-elect Jair Bolsonaro's cabinet. Da Silva's attorneys have already filed an appeal alleging that the appointment proves the judge's bias.\n\nMoro said that he has no intention of ever running for elected office and said his work at the ministry would be \"technical.\"\n\nMoro at times defended Bolsonaro, saying some of the far-right politician's extreme comments had been taken out of context, but he also said the two disagree on some points, such as Bolsonaro's contention that people who occupy land in protest should be considered terrorists.\n\nMoro rose to national prominence by cracking down on the white-color corruption, but as the head of the justice and public security ministries, he will now face a potentially thornier problem: a scourge of violent crime, often fueled by drug-trafficking gangs. Last year, nearly 64,000 people were killed in Brazil, a record for the country that has long been the world leader in annual homicides.\n\nMoro told reporters that he would use some of the same tools employed in Car Wash to fight organized crime, such as using task forces to investigate crimes, saying that New York had success with the practice in its fight against the mafia.\n\nIn contrast to Bolsonaro, whose rhetoric on crime often focuses on the use of police force, Moro spoke about improving data collection, using technology and imprisoning and isolating gang leaders to combat organized crime.\n\n\"A good police operation is when no one gets hurt, and the criminal goes to jail, and the police officer goes home,\" he said.\n\nHe also pledged to implement measures to help fight corruption and said that if wrongdoing were found in Bolsonaro's administration, the justice system would pursue it.\n\nCritics worry that Bolsonaro's praise of the military dictatorship and torture, his often violent rhetoric on crime and his repeated disparaging remarks about women, black people and gays presage policies that will roll back civil rights. The president-elect himself obliquely referenced those fears on Tuesday at a ceremony to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Brazil's constitution, saying the document is the \"true north\" of democracy.\n\nMoro, too, addressed those concerns, saying that everything he would do would be based in the law and rights.\n\n\"There is no possibility that there will be a policy of discrimination against minorities,\" he said.", "Play Audio Clip Listen to audio clip.\n\nThe Benson and Harf Show on FOX News Talk!\n\nGuy and Marie are live from the Fox Nation tent at Fox Square on Election Night!\n\nDownload, enjoy and please give us a review!

And according to a new survey from Unisys, election security is certainly on the minds of voters as they head to polls across the country.\n\n\"What we found was 86 percent of the people surveyed - and it was a statistically significant survey - said they had concerns about election hacking,\" Unisys CEO Peter Altabef told Fox News in an exclusive interview, \"and 19 percent of the people said they either were not going to vote or were highly unlikely to vote because of those concerns.\"\n\nFOREIGN HACKERS HAVE US ELECTION NETWORKS IN THEIR CROSSHAIRS, REPORT SAYS\n\nBut one group, in particular, is most concerned about security this year: young people. Unfortunately, they're also the least likely to cast a ballot. \"The younger you were, the more likely you were either not going to vote or highly unlikely to vote,\" says Altabef, \"so 18 to 34 were disproportionately concerned about hacking.\"\n\nThe good news is that most experts say there's little physical threat to American voting systems at this time, and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen recently assured voters that the electronic systems are secure. Still, if you're worried about the integrity of your vote, Altabef says there are a few steps you can take, starting with increased vigilance at the ballot box. Altabef points out that \"in most of the newer systems, there's a survey page at the end, there's a summary page. And as you go through that summary page, just actually look at it and be careful that it actually records what you intended to record.\"\n\nUnisys is also helping prepare recommendations for making the internet safe for the delivery of critical services - including voting.

The singer tells viewers that anyone can show up to the polls wearing whatever they slept in. But Perry, who insulates that she sleeps in the nude, strips down at the polls and is then arrested for public nudity.\n\nPerry is thrown into the back of a police car and there she runs into comedian Joel McHale, who is also nude because he thought he could walk into the voting room in what he slept in \u2014 which was nothing.

Vetrano's mother, Cathie Vetrano, was in the courtroom as Queens Assistant District Attorney Brad Leventhal recounted the graphic details, and was seen sobbing and clutching a crucifix, according to the New York Daily News.\n\n\u201cShe was attacked brutally,\u201d Leventhal told jurors of the attack in Howard Beach, Queens. \u201dHer attacker struggled with her. He pummeled her. He strangled her. He put his legs on her chest. Then she fought for her life. She struggled to get away.\u201d\n\nLeventhal said Vetrano tried to fight off Lewis.\n\n\u201cAnd he strangled her until she could not struggle anymore. He strangled her until she was dead,\u201d Leventhal said.\n\nPhotos from the crime scene of Vetrano\u2019s naked body were shown in court. After Lewis killed Vetrano, he carried her body into a weed-covered area, removed her sneakers and took her phone and earbuds, Leventhal said.\n\n\u201cThis innocent victim was mercilessly beaten, and brutally killed,\u201d Leventhal said. \u201cShe was killed by a person she had never seen before. This woman was Karina Vetrano.\u201d\n\nVetrano was attacked as she jogged in Spring Creek Park, not far from her home in Queens\u2019 Howard Beach.\n\nKARINA VETRANO'S FATHER SAYS FAMILY \u2018NOT DOING WELL\u2019 ON ANNIVERSARY OF MURDER\n\nVetrano\u2019s father, Phillip Vetrano, was the one who discovered his daughter\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cShe says \u2018See you later,\u2019 to her dad and left her home for a later afternoon jog,\u201d Leventhal said. \u201cIt was one from which she never returned.\u201d\n\nDetective Timothy Gentz testified Monday that Phillip Vetrano was \u201ccompletely destroyed, as one can imagine.\u201d\n\nAuthorities arrested Lewis in February 2017 after his DNA matched samples from the murder scene, officials said. He admitted to the murder in a taped confession, but Lewis' lawyers say the statement was coerced.\n\n\u201cThis case was about rushing to judgment, about making assumptions,\u201d said Lewis\u2019 attorney, Jenny Chung, according to the New York Daily News. \u201cPay close attention to the evidence. Pay attention to what DNA evidence tells you and what it doesn\u2019t tell you.

She unplugged the card reader and booted up into the admin mode.\n\nWith access to the admin mode, hackers could easily install a different operating system or compromise the data for a preferred outcome in the midterm elections.\n\nFOREIGN HACKERS HAVE US ELECTION NETWORKS IN THEIR CROSSHAIRS, REPORT SAYS\n\nLast year at the same conference, experts warned that the machines could be hacked in 24 hours.\n\nFox News has reached out to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission with a request for comment on this story.\n\nThe security of U.S. election systems is firmly in the spotlight.\n\nThe main issue is that criminals and foreign operatives intent on disrupting the midterms have worked harder, faster, and with more intent than those trying to fend off the attacks. Hackers rely on automated processes -- apps, development tools and online databases on services like GitHub or Pastebin -- that make it easy to hack the machines used for tallying votes.\n\nMIDTERMS CYBER FEAR: ONE IN FIVE AMERICANS MAY NOT VOTE OVER SECURITY WORRIES, SURVEY SAYS\n\n\u201cVulnerabilities on voting systems sometimes go unpatched for a long period of time and that\u2019s the window of opportunity for an attacker to act and compromise them,\u201d says Mounir Hahad, the head of the Juniper Threat Labs at Juniper Networks, speaking to Fox News.\n\n\u201cThere is far greater interest in voting machine exploitation [than in 2016],\u201d Brian Varner, a special projects researcher for cyber security services at Symantec, tells Fox News.\n\nVarner says the hacks are not all that complicated. Modern voting machines are now more vulnerable than before, he says. Many have a USB port, so hackers could attach a wireless device to connect to them remotely. The operating system is not that secure, either. Some are stored on a removable chip. A hacker could remove the chip, change the operating system, then reinstall the chip long before the voting machine is ever used.\n\nAnother concern has to do with causing disruption. Varner says hackers wouldn't need to bother with voting machines at all. They could break into the voter registration records in each state, then obtain cell phone numbers for voters. They could send an \u201cofficial\u201d text message telling voters that the polls are now closed or the polling location has changed.\n\nMIDTERM MOVERS: UBER AND LYFT OFFER VOTERS DISCOUNTED RIDES TO THE POLLS\n\n\u201cIf the goal is to delegitimize an election, a cyber threat actor can do this in four ways: change cast ballots, insert fake votes, eliminate legitimate votes or alter the tally of votes,\u201d says Hahad. \u201cIf the goal is to just sow discord and confusion, they can also alter the systems used to report results, such as the secretary of state election results websites.\u201d\n\nOne expert even warned that the damage has already been done.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to hack voting machines or the voter record but says Joseph Carson, chief security scientist at Thycotic, hacking the voter is even more devious.\n\n\u201cCybercriminals have already targeted the midterm elections successfully months and even years ago by causing disruption at the core of the United States of America,\u201d he says. \u201cCreating a divide in the population and the continuous flow of propaganda into the U.S. citizens to make Americans fear their neighbors is right at the core of hacking of the elections. Rather than change the results of the voting systems, you control the mind of the voter.\u201d", "Ride sharing companies Uber and Lyft are offering voters discounted rides to polling stations for the midterm elections.\n\nUber recently announced its \u2018Drive the Vote\u2019 initiative, offering up to $10 off a single ride to the polls on election day. \u201cYour vote is what drives democracy forward.

Biya asked all fighters to drop their guns, threatening further military action. He said he would work to be sure peace returns to Cameroon.\n\nOpposition parties have demonstrated against Biya's re-election, and violence has increased in the North West and South West regions, where armed separatists are fighting for an independent state. Cameroon also faces the threat from Boko Haram extremists crossing the border from Nigeria.\n\nBiya's inauguration comes days after 79 pupils and three staff members were abducted from a school near the northwestern regional capital Bamenda.\n\nA video was released on social media Monday by the apparent kidnappers, showing some of the boys saying they were taken by separatists fighting to create the independent state of Ambazonia.\n\nHowever, the Ambazonia Governing Council, the separatists' official organization, released a statement saying it condemns the kidnappings and demands their release. It said it is investigating the abduction.\n\nThe council called on the military to withdraw from the regions it calls Ambazonia, to avoid further escalation of violence.\n\nFighting between the armed separatists and security forces has killed hundreds and posed a serious challenge for Cameroon, a close U.S. security ally against extremism and a new member of the U.N. Human Rights Council.\n\nThe unrest has also forced tens of thousands to flee, as schools and homes have been attacked and civilians are caught in the crossfire. That meant that the Oct. 7 election saw few voters in English-speaking regions.\n\n\"The objective of the secessionists is against our constitution that consecrates the indivisible nature of our nation,\" Biya said Tuesday at his inauguration. \"We have started implementing measures to attend to the grievances raised by teachers and lawyers by accelerating the decentralization process.\"\n\nThe unrest began in November 2016 when English-speaking teachers and lawyers in the northwest and southwest began calling for reforms and greater autonomy in the largely French-speaking country. They marched in the streets, criticizing what they called the marginalization of English speakers by French speakers.\n\nArmed separatists later took over the protests and began using violence to demand an independent state.\n\n___\n\nPetesch reported from Dakar, Senegal.", "After announcing that she has converted to Islam and changed her name to Shuhada Davitt, Sinead O\u2019Connor took to Twitter to tell her followers that she never wants to spend time with white people ever again, upsetting her Muslim fans.\n\nThe 51-year-old star, who has a history of mental health issues and revealed she\u2019s bipolar, took to Twitter on Tuesday to announce that she\u2019s not interested in being around non-Muslim people ever again.\n\n\u201cI'm terribly sorry.

But the president-elect has been stingy with the details, and many wonder if he'll stick to his recent conversion to market-friendly reforms or if the dormant nationalist in him might reappear.\n\nEven if he holds fast to the agenda set forth by his economic guru Paulo Guedes, a University of Chicago-trained economist and the man who convinced many investors to take a chance on Bolsonaro, the former army captain could face fierce opposition in Congress and from labor unions to what will be undoubtedly unpopular measures. His economic agenda will also have to compete for priority with his better-known promises to crack down on crime and corruption, and the latter are much dearer to his heart \u2014 and his base.\n\n\"It's really unclear what Bolsonaro is when it comes to economic policy,\" said Matthew Taylor, an associate professor at American University's School of International Service. \"He himself has admitted to ignorance on the economic front, but he's also an extraordinary statist and a nationalist.\"\n\nFor years, Bolsonaro, who will be inaugurated Jan. 1, supported heavy involvement of the state in the economy, and he remains an admirer of Brazil's 1964-1985 military regime, which supported nationalist policies. But during the campaign, he espoused free-market principles.\n\nIt's not clear how complete his conversion is. For instance, after Guedes told reporters that he supported privatizing all of Brazil's dozens of state companies, Bolsonaro walked that back, saying he would sell off many but keep \"strategic\" ones, including big names like Petrobras and Banco do Brasil.\n\nAmid this swirl of doubt, one thing is clear: Brazil must quickly cut its deficit or it risks heading back into crisis. A World Bank analysis concluded last year that Brazil spends more than it can afford and spends poorly.\n\nBrazil's central government deficit was 7 percent of gross domestic product in 2017, according to the Central Bank, and has been above 5 percent in recent years. A large portion is interest payments on debt, but even excluding those, Brazil still had a primary deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP last year \u2014 which economists say is unsustainable because it means the already high debt level will continue to grow.\n\nThe new administration will have only a narrow window to show investors that it's serious about addressing this problem \u2014 by cutting spending or raising taxes \u2014 before they will begin to balk, making an adjustment more difficult because it could drive up borrowing costs.\n\nCompounding the challenge, Brazil is only just beginning to emerge from a two-year-long recession, and growth remains stagnant. That means it can't rely on big increases in tax revenues to help it plug the hole \u2014 and Bolsonaro has even promised to cut tax rates.\n\nGuedes, who will lead the Economy Ministry, appeared to be sending just that signal hours after Bolsonaro's victory on Oct. 28. He laid out a three-part plan to reduce Brazil's public spending by passing a pension reform, privatizing state companies to draw down the debt and enacting other unspecified reforms that will reduce \"privileges and waste.\"\n\nPension reform will be the linchpin in reducing Brazil's state spending for two reasons: Brazil's government spends more on pensions than anything else, and many other parts of the budget can't be altered because they're mandated by the constitution.\n\nAttempts to reform the pension system will likely face stiff resistance from labor unions and other groups since any measure will force Brazilians to work longer and receive fewer benefits. Bolsonaro, who in 27 years in Congress didn't show any particular gift for building consensus, will have to build a broad coalition to get a reform through. His Social Liberal Party holds about 10 percent of the seats in next Congress, but so does the Workers' Party, which is against such a reform and has vowed tough opposition.\n\nPresident Michel Temer, who is known for his ability to negotiate with Congress, failed at that task. Still, Glauco Legat, the chief analyst at the brokerage Spinelli, points out that Bolsonaro's decisive win gives him more legitimacy than Temer, who came to power after his predecessor was impeached in controversial proceedings.\n\nAny reform will be whittled away at in order to win votes, but Monica de Bolle, director of Latin American Studies at Johns Hopkins University, says she fears Bolsonaro's proposal will lack ambition right out of the gate since he has indicated he will leave military personnel out of it. That could also mean he will exclude other civil service sectors, which are key to taking a bite out of the problem.\n\n\"The watering down process is going to take place on the basis of an already diluted reform,\" she said.\n\nBeyond pension reform, Bolsonaro has promised to reduce the size of the state, including halving the number of ministries, and selling off state companies. Reducing the number of ministries could yield some savings, but other presidents have struggled to do that in more than name. And Bolsonaro has already taken off the table many state companies that would yield the most cash.\n\nInstead, economists say that many of the savings lie in eliminating inefficiencies. Guedes didn't give details, but if he's serious about reducing waste, there's plenty of it: The World Bank analysis highlighted Brazil's high civil service salaries, a constitutional mandate on education spending that often results in spending for spending's sake, overlapping social welfare programs and a proliferation of small hospitals in the public health system.\n\nDespite the challenges, Legat said it's important to remember that just by virtue of saying he'll take on Brazil's thorny issues, Bolsonaro has built momentum, which can have real-world effects.\n\n\"He brings optimism that's very important for the economy in this moment,\" he said. \"This increase in confidence is reflected in real numbers.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Victor Caivano contributed to this report.\n\nFollow Sarah DiLorenzo: www.twitter.com/sdilorenzo", "Try Some Of Our Other Podcasts!", "Scientists want to build a laser that could guide an extraterrestrial civilization and bring them to Earth.\n\nA new research paper from an MIT graduate student suggests that humanity could theoretically build an infrared laser that could be both hot and bright enough to attract the attention of intelligent civilizations, if it was aimed at nearby exoplanets.

Whether or not this is a good idea, that\u2019s a discussion for future work.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Clark and the study's co-author, Kerri Cahoy, believe that a telescopic beacon could help contact aliens if it were to help make the Sun look odd, effectively emitting a flash, causing any intelligent civilization to sit up and take notice.\n\nELON MUSK SAYS HE 'LIKES THE IDEA' OF TRUMP'S SPACE FORCE\n\n\u201cWith current survey methods and instruments, it is unlikely that we would actually be lucky enough to image a beacon flash, assuming that extraterrestrials exist and are making them,\u201d Clark noted. \u201cHowever, as the infrared spectra of exoplanets are studied for traces of gases that indicate the viability of life, and as full-sky surveys attain greater coverage and become more rapid, we can be more certain that, if E.T. is phoning, we will detect it.\u201d\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nFollow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter @Chris_Ciaccia", "Former Hillary Clinton adviser Philippe Reines said in a new interview that Juanita Broaddrick is \u201cfull of s---,\u201d declaring in no uncertain terms that he does not believe the woman who has repeatedly accused Bill Clinton of raping her.\n\nReines, who is well-known for his unvarnished and sometimes-profane media interviews, was asked by host Jamie Weinstein on a National Review podcast whether he was reevaluating Clinton\u2019s presidency in light of the current #MeToo movement.\n\nSome prominent Democrats have distanced themselves from the former president.

Kavanaugh was confirmed to the court just one month ago but in the political universe it\u2019s already several news cycles and a lifetime ago.\n\nBefore you fill in a bubble on your ballot \u2014 remember the liberal machine\u2019s heavily orchestrated campaign to destroy an honorable man by any means necessary.\n\nRemember Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s, D-N.Y., words, \u201cI will oppose him with everything I\u2019ve got.\u201d The Democrats made good on Schumer\u2019s pledge and they almost succeeded in destroying him \u2014 almost.\n\nRemember that Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., received a letter outlining sexual assault allegations by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford in July, and didn\u2019t bother to share this information until right before the Senate Judiciary Committee was to vote on Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination in September? During that time Feinstein met privately with Kavanaugh and wasn\u2019t disturbed enough to question him about the allegations.\n\nRemember how major details like the time or place the alleged assault took place, as well as other key details were missing from Ford\u2019s testimony? Remember how she offered no actual proof of sexual misconduct and how all the other people she named in her letter contradicted her statement?\n\nRemember how numerous women across the political spectrum who have known Kavanaugh throughout his life, both professionally and personally, attested to his character? They included female law clerks, women he dated in high school and college, the mom of a girl he coached in basketball, and an open letter from 65 women he knew in high school.\n\nRemember this when you go to the polls: The Senate Judiciary Committee released a report this weekend clearing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of multiple sexual misconduct allegations. The committee\u2019s chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a statement, \u201cThis was a serious and thorough investigation that left no stone unturned in our pursuit of the facts. In the end, there was no credible evidence to support the allegations against the nominee.\u201d\n\nRemember how Democrats used Ford when it looked like she was their only hope of defeating Kavanaugh and then dropped her when she was of no use to them anymore?\n\nFord wanted to remain anonymous, yet somehow her letter leaked to the media. Since Feinstein never bothered to pursue a private investigation, there were very few people who supposedly knew about the letter.\n\nThe process of elimination says the letter was likely leaked by either Feinstein\u2019s office, Rep. Anna Eshoo\u2019s, D-Calif., office, where the letter was originally sent, or Ford\u2019s lawyer, who coincidentally (or not) was recommended by Feinstein. Why would they leak the letter if they were trying to protect her?\n\nRemember when you go to the polls Tuesday that in the wake of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation vote, Ariel Dumas, writer for \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d tweeted, \u201cWhatever happens, I'm just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaugh's life.\u201d\n\nShe gave us a very telling page out of the liberal playbook. If they couldn\u2019t defeat Kavanaugh with everything they\u2019ve got then they\u2019d at least celebrate destroying his life. This perverse way of thinking is nothing short of pure evil.\n\nRemember this when you go to the polls: The Senate Judiciary Committee released a report this weekend clearing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of multiple sexual misconduct allegations.

In the end, there was no credible evidence to support the allegations against the nominee.\u201d\n\nThe smear campaign is being exposed for the sham that it was, and one by one the lack of credibility of Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers is being exposed.\n\nThe committee recently referred four people to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation. Among them is Judy Munro-Leighton, who accused Kavanaugh of raping her but then admitted she was lying because she was upset.\n\nMunro-Leighton never even met Kavanaugh in person and \u2014 surprise \u2014 she\u2019s a left-wing activist. She described her actions a \"just a ploy,\u201d and said, \u201dI was angry.\u201d\n\nWhen most people are angry they go for a run or squeeze a stress ball. They don\u2019t set out to purposely destroy a man\u2019s life \u2014 his family, his career.\n\nThis malicious behavior is what you need to remember when you go to the polls on Tuesday.\n\nThe committee also referred Julie Swetnick, and her attorney Michael Avenatti, for investigation after Swetnick gave an NBC interview where she contradicted a sworn statement accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. You may remember Swetnick\u2019s ex-boyfriend came out and said he had to get a restraining order for her because she went after his wife and their baby. Not exactly a glowing example of credibility to begin with.\n\nThe fourth referral was a man who retracted a statement he made accusing Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting a woman in 1985 on a boat in Rhode Island.\n\nThe \u201cLate Show\u2019s\u201d Dumas and her liberal friends will have to put the cork back in their champagne. Turns out they didn\u2019t ruin Kavanaugh\u2019s life or reputation after all.

In a war where the dead would be counted in millions \u2014 1.4 million for France, 1.1 million for British imperial forces \u2014 the United States had 126,000 dead to mourn.\n\nWhen U.S. President Donald Trump joins other world leaders at World War I armistice events hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron this weekend, he plans to visit some of the burial sites.\n\nAnd standing among the white crosses, Trump will see that the pre-eminent military force he commands had its roots in French soil, where U.S. troops were instrumental in turning the tide after their nation shed its isolationism and stood by its European allies.\n\nIf the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery symbolizes America's coming-of-age in the war, the Aisne-Marne cemetery at the Belleau Wood battleground marks its beginning.\n\nWhen the war started in 1914, most Americans considered it \"Europe's war.\" A hit song in 1915 was titled \"I Didn't Raise My Boy To Be A Soldier\" and President Woodrow Wilson won re-election in 1916 with the campaign slogan \"He kept us out of war.\"\n\nGerman belligerence soon had Americans rethinking the wisdom of isolation, said Bruce Malone, a historian and superintendent of the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery.\n\n\"Unrestricted warfare, sinking ships with Americans on them or American ships\" and the infamous Zimmermann telegram in which Germany promised to give Mexico some American territory if it kept the U.S. engaged shifted the momentum, he said.\n\n\"Even President Wilson, who did not want to be in the war, had no choice,\" said Malone.\n\nOn April 6, 1917, the U.S. declared war, much to the relief of its European allies.\n\n\"It wasn't going well in Europe at the time, and the Germans were actually gaining some momentum. The Allies were essentially running out of men to fight the war,\" Malone said.\n\nThere was one problem though, he added.\n\n\"We join the war. We've made promises, but we don't have an army. Certainly not of the European standard,\" he said.\n\nSpeed was of the essence. Russia left the war in March 1918 and Germany had sent its troops to the Western front for a final full onslaught. Just in time, U.S. soldiers started arriving en masse.\n\nPershing, disregarding British and French pleas to use U.S. troops to beef up depleted lines under British and French command, always wanted his men to fight as an independent American force. A major breakthrough came at Belleau Wood, when U.S. forces stopped a German advance on Paris against heavy odds. It proved their mettle to the enemy and allies alike.\n\nThe Americans kept building on their newly acknowledged grit through the end of the war. Saenz was there to record it.\n\n\"The bloody fighting and our victory was the decisive blow that finished the Teutonic pride and dispelled forever the Germans' false dream of global conquest,\" he wrote after a Nov. 2 victory.\n\nInstead, the United States could start dreaming of making the next century its own.\n\n___\n\nVideojournalist Mark Carlson and photojournalist Virginia Mayo contributed reporting.\n\n___\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

Assistance Mission in Afghanistan report said. The rest were killed or wounded in the days that followed when delayed polling took place in some provinces.\n\nElection day for Afghanistan's first parliamentary elections since 2010 was Oct. 20 and took place against a backdrop of near-daily attacks by Taliban insurgents, who have seized nearly half the country and have repeatedly refused offers to negotiate with the Afghanistan government. The U.S.-backed government is rife with corruption and many Afghans have said they do not expect the elections to be fair. Yet millions of Afghans have defied Taliban threats and waited, often for hours, to cast their votes.\n\nThe numbers reveal that more civilians were harmed in this year's election violence than in the four previous Afghanistan national elections, according to the report.\n\nVoting in some provinces was extended by a day to Oct. 21. Elections were delayed for a week in southern Kandahar province after an attack by an elite Afghan guard killed two top government officials, including a powerful provincial police chief.

In deference to his age and health, the trial is being restricted to a maximum of two hours a day, with no more than two non-consecutive days a week. At the same time, because he was under 21 at the time of his alleged crimes, he is being tried in juvenile court.\n\nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center, which helped locate some 20 Stutthof survivors for the case to serve as possible witnesses, emphasized that such trials are important, even more than 70 years after the end of World War II.\n\n\"The passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of Holocaust perpetrators and old age should not afford protection to those who committed such heinous crimes,\" said the center's head Nazi hunter, Efraim Zuroff.\n\nMany survivors, along with relatives of victims, are also joining the trial as co-plaintiffs as allowed under German law.\n\nEven though the number of suspects is dwindling, the special federal prosecutor's office in Ludwigsburg that investigates Nazi war crimes still has multiple cases ongoing. In addition to looking at camps like Stutthof, Buchenwald, Ravensbrueck, Mauthausen and Flossenbuerg, it is also investigating former members of the mobile killing squads known as the \"Einsatzgruppen.\"\n\nThe legal reasoning that being a camp guard is itself enough to be found guilty of accessory to murder, even without specific evidence of a crime, was first used successfully against former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk in 2011.\n\nDemjanjuk was convicted in Munich on allegations he served as a Sobibor death camp guard. He always denied the accusation and died before his appeal could be heard.\n\nThe 2015 conviction of former Auschwitz guard Oskar Groening using the same argument, however, was upheld by Germany's top criminal court on appeal, cementing the precedent.\n\nThe Stutthof case is the first time a prosecution is going to trial using this line of reasoning for a concentration camp guard instead of a death camp guard. But prosecutors have expressed confidence it can be applied, since tens of thousands of people were killed in Stutthof even though its sole purpose was not murder.\n\nStutthof was established in 1939 and underwent several iterations, initially being used as the main collection point for Jews and non-Jewish Poles removed from the nearby city of Danzig on the Baltic Sea coast.\n\nFrom about 1940 onward, it was used as a so-called \"work education camp\" where forced laborers, primarily Polish and Soviet citizens who had run afoul of their Nazi oppressors, were sent to serve sentences and often died. Others incarcerated there included criminals, political prisoners, homosexuals and Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nFrom mid-1944, it was filled with tens of thousands of Jews from ghettos being cleared by the Nazis in the Baltics as well as from Auschwitz, which was overflowing, and thousands of Polish civilians swept up in the brutal suppression of the Warsaw uprising.", "The eldest son of former Republican Arizona Gov.

Pretend I\u2019m on the ballot.\u201d\n\nAt an airport in Indiana ahead of another Monday evening rally, Trump simultaneously seemed to downplay his role while also expressing an eagerness to bear the responsibility for his party's performance on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's really about the candidate, but if they want to give me the credit or the liability, I'll be willing to take it,\" Trump told reporters.\n\n\"In a sense, I am on the ticket.\" \u2014 President Trump\n\nOver the past several months, Trump has unabashedly taken credit for the big wins enjoyed by several Republican candidates throughout this year's primary season, which often came directly after his endorsement.\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who is locked in a tight gubernatorial race against Stacey Abrams, had surged ahead of Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle only after he secured Trump's backing. Similarly, Republican John Cox secured a spot on Tuesday's ballot in California's gubernatorial race when Trump urged the party to coalesce behind him.\n\nKEMP ANNOUNCES LAST-MINUTE PROBE INTO POSSIBLE VOTER HACKING BY GEORGIA DEMOCRATS\n\nPerhaps the most stunning example of Trump's influence unfolded on June 12 in South Carolina, when Trump-bashing Rep. Mark Sanford was unseated by Katie Arrington. As voters headed to the polls, Trump tweeted that \"Sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA\" and called him \"MIA and nothing but trouble.\"\n\nAlso attributable, at least in part, to Trump's endorsements: Republican State Sen. Troy Balderson pushing back a challenge from insurgent Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor in Ohio's special election in August; South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster's win over rival businessman John Warren; and New York Rep. Dan Donovan's rise to beat Michael Grimm.\n\n\"When I decided to go to Ohio for Troy Balderson, he was down in early voting 64 to 36,\" Trump tweeted. \"That was not good. After my speech on Saturday night, there was a big turn for the better. Now Troy wins a great victory during a very tough time of the year for voting. He will win BIG in Nov.\" (Fox News currently rates Balderson's bid for Ohio's 12th Congressional District as lean Republican.)\n\nTRUMP ANNOUNCES PLAN TO DENY ASLYUM-SEEKERS WHO DON'T ARRIVE AT PORT OF ENTRY, IN APPARENT ATTEMPT TO REJECT MANY CARAVAN MEMBERS\n\nBut as voters head to the polls, some Republicans are suggesting that Trump's fiery, immigration-focused messaging may have derailed the GOP's electoral chances in some key races. And Trump himself seemingly acknowledged that, despite his efforts, his party is looking at long odds in several congressional races.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to do well in the House,\" Trump said. \"But, as you know, my primary focus has been on the Senate, and I think we\u2019re doing really well in the Senate.\u201d\n\nLast week, Trump rebuked House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and told him that he \"should be focusing on holding the Majority\" rather than challenge his proposal to end birthright citizenship -- which was widely seen as an effort to cast some blame on Ryan if Democrats retake the lower chamber.\n\nLast Friday's jobs report showed the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent, the lowest it has been in nearly 50 years, and that employers added roughly 250,000 jobs in October. Consumer confidence is at record-high levels. In an exclusive Fox News op-ed published Monday, Trump focused extensively on the economy, which he called \"red-hot\" and \"the envy of the world.\"\n\nTRUMP MAKES CLOSING ARGUMENT IN FOX NEWS OP-ED: VOTE REPUBLICAN AND CONTINUE THE JOBS BOOM\n\nAt times, though, Trump has appeared unwilling to discuss those figures publicly.\n\n\"Sometimes it\u2019s not as exciting to talk about the economy because we have a lot of other things to talk about,\" Trump said at a rally Wednesday night in West Virginia. He proceeded to discuss the migrant caravan and birthright citizenship -- more contentious issues that analysts say may turn off some moderate voters.\n\n\"Does that bring a single person to the polls? Is it moving any undecided voter \u2014 toward you, anyway?\" Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist asked, in an interview with The Washington Examiner. \"Immigration is not a consensus issue within the current Republican Party because so many Republican voters are immigrants.\"\n\nIn an interview with The Los Angeles Times on Monday, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Trump \"owns the Republican Party even more than Reagan\" -- and he's wielding that historic influence accordingly.\n\n\"He has polarized the election on the issues he believes in, on his terms, despite the news media,\" Gingrich said. \"You can argue whether or not it\u2019s the right gamble. But it\u2019s his gamble.\u201d\n\nThe White House said early Tuesday that Trump will be eagerly watching to see if that gamble has paid off.\n\n\u201cAfter 11 rallies in 8 states and weeks of campaigning for Republican candidates, the President will spend today making phone calls, monitoring Congressional, Senate and Gubernatorial races across the country and meeting with his political team for real-time updates,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. \"Later this evening the President and First Lady have invited family and friends to join them in the residence as they watch election returns.\u201d", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nThousands of Central Americans dreaming of getting to the United States streamed into Mexico's capital and bedded down in a sports stadium on the eve of U.S. midterm elections in which President Donald Trump has made the migrant caravan a central issue.\n\nAuthorities counted more than 2,000 migrants entering the Jesus Martinez stadium by midafternoon Monday, and a steady flow continued into the night. The facility has a capacity to hold 6,000, officials said, and four big tents set up for sleeping filled up.\n\nStill hundreds of miles from the U.S. border, early arrivals eagerly sifted through donated clothes, gave themselves sponge baths and ate chicken and rice. They then picked up thin mattresses to hunker down for the night. Much in demand were blankets to ward off the chill in a city more than 7,300 feet (2,240 meters) above sea level, a big change after trudging for three weeks in tropical heat.\n\nNashieli Ramirez, ombudsman for the local human rights commission, said the city was preparing to accommodate as many as 5,000 people. The lead caravan is estimated to have about 4,000 participants and several smaller groups are trailing hundreds of miles to the south.\n\n\"We have the space in terms of humanitarian help,\" Ramirez said.\n\nMany of the migrants sought treatment for blistered and aching feet, illness and other maladies. \"Since we got here, we have not stopped,\" said Tania Escobar, a nurse with Mexico City's public health department at the treatment tent.\n\nMelvin Figueroa, a 32-year-old from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, was with his pregnant wife and two children, 6 and 8. He took the 6-year-old girl to the tent because her eyes were irritated and \"she throws up everything she eats.\"\n\nMore migrants were trudging along the highway between the city of Puebla and the capital, trying to hitch rides from passing vehicles.\n\nTrump has seized on the caravan and portrayed it as a major threat, even though such caravans have happened regularly over the years and largely passed unnoticed. He ordered thousands of troops to the U.S.-Mexico border when the migrants were still hundreds of miles to the south, threatened to detain asylum seekers in tents cities and has insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nIn dozens of interviews since the initial caravan set out from Honduras more than three weeks ago, migrants have said they are escaping rampant poverty and violence. Many are families traveling with small children. Some say they left because they were threatened by gang members or had lost relatives to gang violence. Others say they hope to work, secure a good education for their children and send money to support loved ones back home.\n\nAlba Zoleida Gonzalez, 48, from Valle, Honduras, said she walked for five hours Monday, then was able to get a ride on a tractor-trailer with about 150 other migrants. Her calf muscles were aching, but that was a small price to pay for the chance at a life better than the one back home.\n\n\"I looked for work, and nothing,\" Gonzalez said, adding that her husband had been robbed and had to hand over everything he made selling crabs so his assailants wouldn't do worse. \"And when one does find a little job they kill you for the money,\" she said.\n\nArriving in Mexico City, some migrants visited the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a major pilgrimage site, to thank the Virgin Mary for watching over them during the journey.\n\nThe caravan had spread out in recent days, with many participants advancing at a faster pace. Many said the caravan would now regroup in Mexico City. Oscar Ulloa, 20, an accountant from Honduras who was able to travel to the capital by bus from Puebla thanks to handouts from Mexicans, said he expected the group to vote in the coming days on its next moves.\n\nThe 178-mile (286-kilometer) route followed Monday to Mexico City from the city of Cordoba in the Gulf state of Veracruz was the longest single-day journey attempted by the group.\n\nThere were obstacles on this latest stretch. Truck after truck denied migrants rides as they trudged along the highway into the relatively colder November temperatures of central highland Mexico. Then migrants converged on tractor trailers, forcing the big rigs to stop so they could climb aboard. Such impromptu hitchhiking is precarious with dozens scrambling onto vehicles at a time.\n\nMexico City is more than 600 miles from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas. A caravan last spring opted for a much longer route to Tijuana in the far northwest, across from San Diego. That caravan steadily dwindled to only about 200 people by the time it reached the border.\n\nMany in the latest group said they remain convinced that traveling together is their best hope for reaching the U.S.\n\nBut Edgar Corzo, an official with the National Human Rights Commission, said that based on experiences with previous migrant caravans, the group probably will begin to break up now that it is in the capital.\n\n\"Each one goes to the place that he considers best,\" mainly wherever is closest to where they have relatives or friends already in the United States, he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amy Guthrie contributed to this report.", "More than a year after Hurricane Maria caught Puerto Rico's government wildly unprepared, officials acknowledge they still haven't come up with a plan to cope with the next such disaster \u2014 and it's not clear when they will.\n\nThe U.S. territory's government insisted for months that it had a complete, updated disaster plan, saying it was kept secret due to protect information about vulnerable infrastructure and officials' private contact details.\n\nBut a suit filed by Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Journalism led officials to concede last month that that plan doesn't deal with catastrophic events such as hurricanes and earthquakes, prompting outrage on an island where many blame government bungling for the estimated 2,975 deaths linked to Category 4 Hurricane Maria, which hit in September 2017.\n\n\"The government has clearly failed the people and hid the fact that the plan was under revision,\" said Nazario Lugo, a former executive director of Puerto Rico's emergency management agency and president of the island's Association of Emergency Managers.\n\n\"We are talking about the lives of people. Someone is not going to react the way they're supposed to. This is a team effort, and when the team is not in tune, when it's not in position, it fails,\" he said. \"Lives are lost.\"\n\nCarlos Acevedo, director of Puerto Rico's Bureau for Emergency and Disaster Management, did not respond to requests for comment about why the plan hasn't been updated.\n\nAt the Oct. 30 court hearing, government lawyer Tania Fernandez said she didn't know when the plan would be finished and made public because officials haven't yet hired experts to create such plans.\n\nA partial plan released by the government last month stresses the risks of poor preparation and blames previous administrations.\n\n\"The consequences of Hurricane Maria made it clear that we did not have emergency plans that contemplated such scenarios, nor the sufficient resources to face catastrophic disasters of such historical magnitude,\" the document states.\n\nHowever, Lugo and another former emergency management agency director, Epifanio Jimenez, said Puerto Rico has had a plan for a Category 4 hurricane that was drawn up after Hurricane Hugo, a Category 3 storm, hit the island in 1989. They say Gov. Ricardo Rossello's administration failed to follow it.\n\n\"They're using the impact of Maria ... to justify the unjustifiable,\" Jimenez said of what many consider a botched government response to that storm. \"Improvisation is the worst enemy of emergency management, and we saw that.\"\n\nLugo and Jimenez said that emergency response was hindered by a lack of fuel and truck drivers, communication between local government agencies broke down, supplies weren't dispatched quickly enough and officials didn't know the immediate needs of each municipality.\n\nDespite the lack of a finished formal plan, local and federal officials have learned lessons from Maria and are more prepared than they were when that storm hit, according to Jesus Cuartas, an operational planning chief for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who urged patience.\n\n\"We are not racing for time,\" he said. \"Any plan that is simply rushed out the door ... the thought of that being viable is slim to none.\"", "It\u2019s finally here.\n\nAfter hundreds of campaign rallies, billions of dollars in donations, a nonstop blitz of TV advertising and polling that\u2019s been in full swing since summer, Election Day has arrived \u2013 and with it, voters\u2019 midterm verdict on whether Republicans should hold or lose their grip on power in Washington.\n\nDemocrats have been working toward this day since the moment President Trump was sworn in. They\u2019ve waited two long years for the shot to win enough seats in Congress to cripple the 45th president\u2019s agenda.\n\nIn the end, the elections will go one of three ways: Republicans hold both chambers, Democrats take the majority in both, or the parties split the House and Senate. Either of the latter two scenarios would be problematic for Trump, immediately putting a damper on his agenda.\n\nBy the numbers, 35 Senate seats, 36 gubernatorial seats and 435 House seats are up for grabs on Tuesday. And the biggest names in both parties say the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher.\n\n\u201cAmerica is at a crossroads right now,\u201d former President Barack Obama told supporters in Illinois over the weekend, saying it \u201cmight be the most important election of my lifetime, maybe more important than 2008.\u201d\n\nTrump himself has been campaigning non-stop in recent days, telling voters they must keep Democrats from taking back control of the House and Senate, or his agenda could be in jeopardy. The party of the president has historically lost seats in their first midterm elections.\n\n\u201cWe have to win,\u201d Trump told supporters Monday during a telephone town hall, ticking off accomplishments during his first years in office and warning everything he\u2019s accomplished as president can be \u201cundone and changed by the Democrats.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the lay of the land on Election Day:\n\nFor Democrats, their best shot at winning back control of a body of Congress is in the House, where they need to net 23 seats for a majority. Whether they flip the House or not, Democrats are still expected to gain seats in the chamber, given the favorable political environment for Democrats.\n\nRepublicans currently hold a slim 51-49 majority in the Senate, and Democrats have long aimed to win back control. But it will be more difficult for Democrats to be victorious in the Senate by netting two seats in part because of the large number of incumbent Democrats running for re-election in states won by Trump in 2016.\n\nRepublicans currently control 33 governorships, with Democrats holding 16. But with 36 seats up this year, Democrats are likely to pick up at least some seats. According to the Fox News Gubernatorial Power Rankings, Republicans are favored to control at least 22 seats by the end of the night and Democrats are favored have at least 20 seats, with 8 additional toss-up races.\n\nElection watchers could be in for a long time. The first polls, on the East Coast, close at 7 p.m. ET. After polls on the West Coast close at 11 p.m. ET, the last will close in Alaska at 1 a.m. ET.\n\nAhead of the vote, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi confidently predicted last week that Democrats would indeed win back the House.\n\n\u201cLet me say this. Up until today, I would\u2019ve said, \u2018If the election were held today, we would win,\u2019\u201d Pelosi said on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d Tuesday. \u201cWhat now I\u2019m saying is, \u2018We will win.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut there are no guarantees about Election Day, even as generic congressional ballots show Democrats with the advantage over Republicans. While Democrats need to net 23 seats for a majority, the Fox News House Power Rankings indicate there are 29 \u201ctoss-up\u201d races.\n\nIf Democrats are victorious, the Trump administration likely will be in for a challenging 2019. Should Democrats re-take the House, there are signs some in the conference may launch a push to impeach the president \u2013 though the leadership has not yet backed the effort. Pelosi has said impeachment is \"not a priority,\" at least not until Special Counsel Robert Mueller announces the conclusions of his probe into the Trump administration's alleged dealings with Russia.\n\nTrump, though, almost assuredly will face an avalanche of investigations into his tax returns, his payments to adult-film star Stormy Daniels and his relationship with Russia if Democrats win back the House \u2013 which comes with the much-coveted power to subpoena and launch congressional investigations.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP'S CLOSING ARGUMENT: VOTE REPUBLICAN AND CONTINUE THE JOBS BOOM\n\nA number of prominent anti-Trump Democrats also would be poised to assume control of key committees if Republicans lose control of the House.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., likely would be elevated to chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, where she currently serves as ranking member. Another top California Democratic representative, Adam Schiff, would likely rise to chair the House Intelligence Committee, where he is now the ranking member. And Pelosi would look to regain the speakership.\n\nStill, if Democrats win the House \u2013 but Republicans hold the Senate \u2013 their legislative priorities likely would stall.\n\nIn the Senate, the Fox News Senate Power Rankings lists Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Arizona and Nevada as the five most competitive races. Of those races, Democrats in three states won by Trump are defending their seats.\n\nRepublicans feel more confident about keeping control of the Senate \u2013 or possibly adding to their majority. But the threat to the Trump agenda is real if they lose control. Democrats have a narrow path to the majority if they run the table in the toss-ups and pick off one GOP-favored seat, like Texas or Tennessee. If Democrats win control of both houses of Congress, they could send legislation to Trump\u2019s desk. And, in the Senate, they would have the votes to block any of Trump's nominees \u2013 coming after Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s brutal confirmation fight last month.\n\nOn the day before America votes, Trump hopscotched to rallies in three battleground states -- in Ohio, Indiana and Missouri.\n\nIn Ohio, Trump campaigned for a slate of Republicans, including Jim Renacci in his bid to unseat Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown. Trump won the state with 52 percent of the vote in 2016 but the Fox News Senate Power Rankings lists that contest as \u201clikely Democrat.\u201d\n\nLater Monday, the president flew to Fort Wayne, Indiana, where he is hoping to give Republican Mike Braun an assist to defeat incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly. He then traveled to Missouri to lend a hand to Josh Hawley in his campaign to beat incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill.\n\nMeanwhile, in state capitals across the country, Republicans have control of a majority of governorships, holding 33 to the Democrats\u2019 16 seats.\n\nDemocrats are likely to pick up at least some seats, with 36 gubernatorial seats up for grabs this year. According to the Fox News Gubernatorial Power Rankings, 15 of the contested seats lean Republican, 13 lean Democrat and eight are tossups.\n\nFor Republicans, holding on to control of state houses is important, considering that\u2019s where real policy changes may take place if Democrats win control of Congress and Washington effectively deadlocks.\n\nAmong the most-watched races: Wisconsin GOP Gov. Scott Walker is locked in a tight re-election battle with Democratic challenger Tony Evers and Tallahassee Democratic Mayor Andrew Gillum is facing off against Trump-backed GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis in Florida.\n\nThough the political environment seems to favor Democrats, Trump argued Monday that Republican voters are energized heading into Tuesday\u2019s vote, saying he hasn\u2019t felt such \u201celectricity\u201d since he was elected president in 2016.\n\n\"Tomorrow, with your votes, you can stop the radical resistance in its tracks,\" Trump told the crowd in Cleveland.\n\nFox News\u2019 Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "Play Audio Clip Listen to audio clip.\n\nElection Day is finally here.

But then he let out a little squeak and I thought 'Oh god, this is a baby and it's alive.'\"\n\nThe boy, Malachi Reeve, had escaped from his parent's tent while they were sleeping while the family was camping at Matata Beach on the North Island during the quiet spring season.\n\nMurphy's Holiday Camp co-owner Rebecca Salter told The Associated Press that the rescue was \"miraculous and fateful\" after Hutt, a regular at the campground, had decided to fish at a different spot than usual and the sea had been particularly calm.\n\nSalter said she and her husband were drinking coffee and planning out their day when the drama unfolded. They rushed to help.\n\n\"My husband came around the corner with the baby in his arms,\" she said. \"I ran into the house and grabbed a whole heap of towels and blankets so he would be warm. He was just whimpering the whole time.\"\n\nSalter said Malachi was drenched, had sand all through his hair and clothes, and was very pale. It took them a while to figure out who had lost the boy, she said, and then they woke the parents.\n\n\"They were horrified and in disbelief,\" Salter said. \"They were woken up to find their baby wasn't there. It was surreal to everyone involved.\"\n\nThe boy's footprints were visible in the sand, showing where he'd wandered from the tent into the water. He'd floated about 15 meters (50 feet) before Hutt spotted him.\n\n\"If I hadn't been there or if I had just been a minute later I wouldn't have seen him,\" Hutt told the newspaper. \"He was bloody lucky but he just wasn't meant to go.

Police have not released his name.\n\nWhitsunday is the largest island in the Whitsunday Islands group, a major international tourist attraction popular with scuba divers and sailors where shark attacks have been rare.\n\nA 46-year-old tourist, Justine Barwick, was attacked on Sept. 19 while swimming from a yacht in Cid Harbor and is recovering. A 12-year-old tourist, Hannah Papps, was attacked in the same harbor the next day, losing a leg.\n\nThe last shark attack in the Whitsunday Islands before the latest spate occurred on Feb. 13, 2010, off Dent Island when a 60-year-old woman survived severe lacerations to her buttocks and major blood loss.\n\nOn Monday, onlookers pulled the injured man on to a boat where he was treated by two off-duty doctors, a nurse and a paramedic from a nearby resort, rescue helicopter crew member Ben McCauley said.\n\n\"He'd suffered very serious bites, significant blood loss as well as cardiac arrest,\" McCauley said.\n\nThe victim was resuscitated twice in less than 45 minutes before he could be taken to shore by boat and flown to hospital, McCauley said.\n\nAustralia has not experienced a fatal shark attack since 17-year-old Laeticia Brouwer lost her leg while surfing with her father off Esperance in Western Australia on April 17 last year.\n\nAustralia has averaged fewer than two deadly shark attacks per year in recent decades.", "", "bad url", "", "", "", "A man with dual British and Australian citizenship whose newlywed wife went missing at sea as the couple sailed off the Bahamas on a belated honeymoon pleaded guilty Monday to an involuntary manslaughter charge in federal court.\n\nLewis Bennett, 41, entered the plea at a hearing Monday in Miami. He faces a maximum eight-year prison sentence in the May 2017 disappearance of Isabella Hellmann, his wife of just three months. U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno set sentencing for Jan. 10.\n\n\"Although nothing can ever erase the pain and suffering caused by Lewis Bennett's criminal acts, the U.S. Attorney's Office and our law enforcement partners hope that the defendant's admission of guilt is a step toward justice for the victim,\" U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan said in a statement.\n\nBennett, a mining engineer, had told the FBI and British journalists that he and Hellmann, a South Florida real estate agent, took their 37-foot (11-meter) catamaran, Surf Into Summer, for a Caribbean cruise. They left their infant daughter, Emelia, with her family in Florida.\n\nAs the catamaran passed the Bahamas on the return to Florida, Bennett sent out an emergency radio signal. When the Coast Guard found him on a life raft three hours later, he told rescuers he left Hellmann on deck as he retired for the night to their cabin. He said he was jolted awake when their craft hit something and that Hellmann was gone when he went outside. He said he abandoned the catamaran in a life raft because it was sinking.\n\nA sworn document signed by Bennett and filed in court says that he could not recall whether he called out for his wife. He did not deploy any flares and did not search for Hellmann in the water with either the catamaran or an attached dinghy. Nor did Bennet immediately activate any emergency equipment or call for help using his satellite phone.\n\nIt was not until Bennett boarded the life raft that he called for help and reported his wife missing, about 45 minutes after he was awakened.\n\nProsecutors said Bennett is an experienced sailor who received a certification from the Royal Yachting Association in the United Kingdom as a \"Coastal Skipper.\" The training included instruction on emergency procedures such as man-overboard protocols and night-sailing safety. His wife was not nearly as experienced.\n\nThe Coast Guard eventually located the boat. The FBI says an inspection of the catamaran before it sank showed portholes below the waterline had been opened and damage to the twin hulls appeared to have been caused from the inside, meaning the boat may have been intentionally scuttled.\n\nAlso investigators found Bennett on the life raft with $100,000 worth of coins stolen from a yacht he had worked aboard in 2016.\n\nBennett pleaded guilty to the coin theft charge and received a seven-month prison sentence. While serving that sentence, he was charged in February with Hellmann's death and has remained jailed.\n\n___\n\nFollow Curt Anderson on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Miamicurt", "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News there is intelligence indicating the caravan of migrants making their way through Mexico includes a limited number of people from outside the region, including the Middle East.\n\n\"We absolutely see people from the Middle East, from southeast Asia, from other parts of the world -- not just from Central America,\" Nielsen said in a wide-ranging interview.\n\nThe caravan started in Honduras last month. This week, hundreds of migrants have begun arriving in Mexico City, seven hundred miles from the U.S. border.\n\nPresident Trump, who has vowed to stop the caravan from entering the United States, tweeted last month that \u201ccriminals and unknown Middle Easterners\u201d are among the migrants.\n\nDemocrats, as well as some Republicans, have accused the Trump administration of fear mongering.\n\n\"Now, in 2018, they\u2019re telling you the existential threat to America is a bunch of poor refugees a thousand miles away,\u201d former President Barack Obama said at a campaign rally on Friday. \u201cThey\u2019re even taking our brave troops away from their families for a political stunt at the border.

They are taking longer routes with more infrastructure to reach their destinations, he said.\n\n\"What I learned from Central American intelligence is that there were at least 132 individuals that came from other parts of the world not from Latin America,\" Humire said.

However, officials are able to discover fraudulent claims through biometrics and the help of partner intelligence services who have access to databases.\n\n\"We have seen individuals they have lied about their identities and tried to deceive immigration authorities saying they are from Pakistan and turned out to be from [the Palestinian territories] or saying they're from Bangladesh and turned out to be from Syria,\u201d he said.\n\nFox News' Cyd Upson contributed to this report.", "", "The U.N.

It has also become a haven for armed groups, including several from neighboring countries, which survive on looting and human trafficking.\n\nThe Netherlands and Sweden pushed for including \"planning, directing or committing acts involving sexual and gender-based violence\" as criteria for sanctions, citing the increasingly worrying problem in Libya especially against migrants trying to reach Europe.\n\nDutch Ambassador Karel Van Oostrom told the council after the vote that such violence \"is directly connected to the issues of peace and security we are discussing today.\"\n\nRussian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia strongly disagreed, saying sexual and gender-based violence is a crime that is dealt with by national governments and is considered at the U.N.

It is not a threat to international peace and security that the Security Council should deal with, he said.\n\n\"We are under the impression that the countries pushing this into the Security Council agenda are attempting to gain domestic political capital through the imposition of sanctions regimes against other states,\" Nebenzia said. \"The facts of such crimes perpetrated against migrants in Libya only confirm our premise that the most effective means of combatting this scourge is eradicating the relevant criminal networks.\"\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador Jonathan Cohen said the resolution should have been adopted unanimously and \"be sending a clear message to the Libyan people \u2014 that we are united behind you and that we on the Security Council will hold Libyan spoilers to account for their actions.\"\n\nIn June, the Security Council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on six leaders of criminal networks engaged in human trafficking and migrant smuggling from Libya, and in September it slapped sanctions on Libyan militia leader Ibrahim Jadran for attacking Libyan oil facilities in the summer.\n\nThe resolution adopted Monday extended authorization for U.N. member states to board suspect vessels and return illegally seized oil to the Libyan government until Feb. 15, 2020.

Some of this emerged during the Supreme Court confirmation process, but the report provides more details.\n\nFord was the key witness against Kavanaugh. In detail, she said Kavanaugh tried to remove her clothing during a high school party, but had trouble because she was wearing a bathing suit underneath them. She said she ran off when Kavanaugh friend Mark Judge jumped on top of them and they fell off the bed. Kavanaugh denied the accusation and, on Oct. 6, the Senate confirmed him to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe man who claims he may have had the encounter with Ford was one of 40 people committee investigators interviewed as part of its probe into the sexual allegations against Kavanaugh, which was done alongside the FBI background check that was compiled in a matter of days.\n\n'NO EVIDENCE' TO BACK KAVANAUGH ACCUSERS' CLAIMS, SENATE PANEL'S REPORT ON FBI PROBE FINDS\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, in releasing the report, said there \u201cwas no credible evidence to support the allegations against\u201d Kavanaugh.\n\nFord testified she was 100 percent positive Kavanaugh assaulted her, rejecting the notion of a case of mistaken identity.\n\nBut the report gave details from the purported witness claiming exactly that scenario. The man told the investigators that when he was a 19-year-old college student, he had visited Washington over spring break and kissed a girl he believes was Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser.\n\n\u201cHe said that the kiss happened in the bedroom of a house which was about a 15-to-20 minute walk from the Van Ness Metro, that Dr. Ford was wearing a swimsuit under her clothing, and that the kissing ended when a friend jumped on them as a joke,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe Van Ness Metro is in Northwest D.C. His name was redacted in the report but investigators interviewed him the day before Ford testified Sept 27.\n\nThe report also summarizes statements from another man who said that after graduating high school in Hampton, Virginia, in 1982 he made several trips to D.C. that summer.\n\nDuring one trip, he attended a house party where he kissed and made out with a woman he met who he believes could have been Ford, the report says.\n\nThe man \u201csaid that based on old photographs of Justice Kavanaugh he has seen on the news, he believes the two of them share a similar appearance,\u201d the report says. His name was also redacted.\n\n\u201cAlthough each individual described details that in some respects seemed to fit Dr. Ford\u2019s allegations against Justice Kavanaugh, both men described consensual encounters,\u201d the report concludes.\n\nFord\u2019s attorney did not respond immediately to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe report also contains these other disclosures:\n\nWitness Tampering?\n\nCommittee investigators are in the process of trying to determine if Ford friend Monica McLean, a former FBI employee, tampered with a witness.\n\n\u201cSeveral media outlets have reported that the FBI\u2019s supplemental report indicated that Leland Keyser, a friend of Dr. Ford, felt pressure from Dr. Ford\u2019s allies to revisit her initial statement to the Committee that she did not know Justice Kavanaugh or have any knowledge of the alleged incident,\u201d the report says.\n\nFord said that when Kavanaugh assaulted her at a party, Keyser was one of the people downstairs.\n\nThe report added that according to the news articles, Keyser reported that McLean and others contacted her to suggest she \u201cclarify\u201d her account.\n\nMcLean\u2019s attorney did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nMistaken Identity at Yale?\n\nThe report summarizes an interview with a Yale grad who said that a member of Kavanaugh\u2019s fraternity -- who was not Kavanaugh -- had a reputation for exposing himself publicly.\n\nThe man was interviewed after Deborah Ramirez told the New Yorker that Kavanaugh had thrust his penis in her face when they were at Yale. She said she was drunk and wasn\u2019t sure it was Kavanaugh until she thought about it for a week and spoke to her attorney. Kavanaugh vehemently denied her accusation.\n\nKAVANAUGH ACCUSER REFERRED TO DOJ FOR FALSE STATEMENTS, GRASSLEY\u2019S OFFICE ANNOUNCES\n\nThe reports says the man, whose name was redacted, also provided a yearbook photo of the frat brother exposing himself.\n\nThe report says the man said he had personally witnessed the flasher expose himself at a party and that the flasher was in the same residential college as Ramirez.\n\nFord Friends\n\nThe report summarizes a statement from William Rand, who went to the University of North Carolina with Ford and told investigators that Ford had a very robust and active social life.\n\nHis statement seemingly was at odds with Ford\u2019s assertions that she had a difficult time making friends due to her encounter with Kavanaugh, according to the report.\n\n\u201cHe also stated that Dr. Ford did not seem to be afraid to be in rooms or apartments with only one entrance, which contradicts her claim to the Committee that she had to build a second front door to her house due to the trauma of the alleged assault,\u201d the report says.\n\nDOJ Referrals\n\nThe report also says that the committee has referred four people to the Justice Department for criminal investigation.\n\nThey are a Rhode Island man who recanted an allegation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted a woman on a boat in Newport in 1985; Judy Munro Leighton, who claimed to have written an anonymous letter asserting Kavanaugh forced her to have oral sex; and Kavanaugh accuser Julie Swetnick and her attorney Michael Avenatti, who also represents the porn actress Stormy Daniels.\n\nAvenatti told Fox News that the Grassley report was \u201cgarbage.\u201d\n\n\u201dThere is no evidence my client or I did anything wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still waiting and hoping the FBI fully investigates this matter. Chuck evidently doesn\u2019t have any juice.\u201d\n\nFox News' Doug McKelway contributed to this report.", "Eritrea is hoping that the U.N. Security Council will soon lift sanctions it imposed against the East African nation in 2009 following its thaw in relations with Ethiopia and other neighboring countries in recent months.\n\nThe Security Council imposed an arms embargo and other tough sanctions against Eritrea for supplying weapons to al-Shabab Islamic militants opposed to the Somali government and for refusing to resolve a border dispute with neighboring Djibouti, a key U.S. ally in the Horn of Africa.\n\nA draft resolution obtained by The Associated Press would lift the arms embargoes, travel bans, asset freezes and targeted sanctions imposed against Eritrea in late 2009. It also urges Eritrea and Djibouti \"to continue efforts to settle their border dispute peacefully in a manner consistent with international law\" and to engage on Djibouti combatants missing in action.\n\nThe Security Council was scheduled to meet behind closed doors Monday to hear from its committee monitoring sanctions against Eritrea and Somalia.\n\nThe draft resolution would also extend the arms embargo on Somalia until Nov. 15, 2019 as well as a ban on the import and export of Somali charcoal, a key source of income including for al-Shabab fighters.\n\nThe Security Council is scheduled to meet on Nov. 14 to vote on an Eritrea-Somalia resolution.\n\nEritrea, a former Italian colony, gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year guerrilla war. It had a decades-long border dispute with Ethiopia, including a war from 1998-2000 in which about 80,000 people died.\n\nBut the East African region saw an unprecedented level of diplomatic activity after Ethiopia's reformist Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, came to power in April and accepted a border decision by an international boundary commission that favored Eritrea.\n\nThe move set off a number of diplomatic thaws, including one between Eritrea and Somalia. Leaders of Djibouti and Eritrea, which also had a turbulent relationship after multiple border clashes, met in recent weeks with the help of regional power, Ethiopia, though no breakthrough was announced.\n\nEthiopia has lobbied for sanctions to be lifted against Eritrea.\n\n\"The final decision will be made on November 14 . but the early signals coming out from New York are positive indeed,\" Eritrea's Minister of Information, Yemane Gebremeskel, tweeted on Saturday. \"Tribute to Eritrea's steadfastness and resilience for nine long years.\"\n\nBut U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said Djibouti is unhappy about the possible lifting of sanctions against Eritrea because their dispute remains unresolved despite the reconciliation between Ethiopia and Eritrea.\n\nEritrea has denied providing any support to al-Shabab and has long accused Ethiopia of spearheading and influencing the sanctions against it. The draft resolution would condemn al-Shabab attacks in Somalia and beyond.\n\n___\n\nAP writer Edith M. Lederer contributed to this report from the United Nations", "Karl Rover, Former Senior Advisor and Deputy Chief of Staff to President George W. Bush, Wall Street Journal Columnist and Fox News Contributor, joined Fox News Radio's Guy Benson and Marie Harf the night before the midterm elections to give his insight.\n\nOn his predictions for Tuesday: First of all, I think it all points to all a relatively close election in all three of the big baskets we're looking at. There are four or five baskets, but the biggest baskets are in the Senate and in the House and in the governors and then we've got local offices and then referendums. I think my sense is we're such a polarized country and the map in the Senate, in particular, is so polarized that we're likely to have a large number of openly contested races. Second thing is I think it's going to be the highest midterm turnout that we've had since 1966. Everybody's energized, both parties are. (2:14)\n\nOn early voting numbers: Here's why you shouldn't put total confidence in the election numbers because we don't know how many defections there are and there are places where there are going to be defections from the party of the chose of the primary voter. Second of all, because we have a large number of people, like in Florida, who decline to state their party or in Texas whom have never voted in a primary. (3:30)\n\nOn polls: I look at polls all the time. I'm involved in a super-pack and we drown in polls, but there was a golden age of polling. Everybody had a landline and we actually answered them and we're no longer there. Until we get better at whatever this new world is where we're all on our mobiles and even then we don't answer unrecognized phone numbers and we haven't yet figured out how to get this all done appropriately on the Internet. You have to look at averages and you have to realize it's an art not a science. (6:22)\n\nOn governors races: It's interesting a couple of states you mentioned there, South Dakota and Iowa, the Democrats have nominated moderate to moderately conservative candidates. The candidate of the Democrats in Iowa is a successful businessman running as a business oriented Democrat and the candidate in South Dakota is running as a somewhat pro-gun, pro-life, business oriented, farm oriented Democrat. When they run that kind of candidate it helps in a state like Dakota. (7:01)\n\nOn a lot of people saying we don't know what's going to happen because of 2016: That's normal. In 2000, we had a number of people prematurely call Florida and as a result in 2004 despite the fact that Bush had 120,000 vote margin against John Kerry the networks would not call Ohio until almost 3 o'clock. That was a reaction to having prematurely called Florida and everybody being juiced up by bad exit polls.

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., is facing off against Democratic opponent businessman Phil Bredesen for a Senate seat.\n\nFurther east, the National Weather Service's Atlanta office said that \"strong to severe thunderstorms\" could be possible in the early morning hours on Tuesday in northwest Georgia, and transitioning southeast as the day goes on.\n\n\"Damaging wind gusts and brief tornadoes remain the primary expected severe threats,\" the NWS said.\n\nTOP 10 MOST SHOCKING MIDTERM ELECTION ADS: SIBLING BETRAYAL, RACIAL SLURS AND MORE\n\nThe Peach State is where Georgia\u2019s secretary of state and Republican gubernatorial hopeful Brian Kemp is locked in a close race against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who could become the first black woman to serve as a U.S. governor. Fox News has rated the race as a \u201ctoss-up.\u201d\n\nBesides the stormy South, a low-pressure system moving over the Great Lakes and an associated cold front will impact parts of the Midwest and Northeast.\n\n\"Rain and storms along the trailing cold front will keep the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast rainy and stormy for Election Day,\" Dean said.\n\nHow could weather impact voters?\n\nCertain types of weather can be shown to have an impact on some voters in deciding whether or not to head to the polls, according to research compiled by AccuWeather.\n\n\"Weather was found to be statistically significant in influencing turnout rates by an average of nearly 20 percent,\" AccuWeather Data Scientist and Meteorologist Tim Loftus told Fox News.\n\nLoftus said that researchers at AccuWeather used L2 as a resource for historical voter data, in addition to proprietary historical weather data which comprises of nearly 300 weather parameters, in order to examine how weather influences voter turnout in each state.\n\nIn Tennessee, for example, cool and damp weather has been found to deter voters from heading to the polls.\n\n\"The heaviest rain and storms should be out of the state on Tuesday which will be good news for voters,\" Loftus said. \"However, any localized areas recovering from the severe weather just prior to Election Day may see less in the way of voter turnout as residents will likely focus on clean up and power restoration efforts.\"\n\nIn Georgia, storms in the state could impact likely voters, especially \"weather-sensitive\" groups that include African Americans, 18 \u2013 24-year-olds, and those 65 and older. Similar rainy conditions are expected in Michigan, which could deter the same groups of people.\n\nIn New Jersey, which has a tightening Senate race between Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez and Republican challenger Bob Hugin, heavy rain may make things \"quite interesting,\" according to Loftus. Republicans tend to fair better in the Garden State compared to Democrats when heavy rain occurs as opposed to when the weather is nice.\n\n\"So for tomorrow, historical trends indicate that Republicans will have the weather-advantage as heavy rain and storms are expected,\" he told Fox News.\n\nFloridians tend to have lower turnout when its warm and muggy, as expected tomorrow, but voters in the 18 to 24-year-old range usually vote on election days that have higher minutes of sunshine, according to Loftus. The only parts of Florida that should see cloudy or rainy weather will be in parts of the Panhandle region.\n\nIn terms of how weather impacts voters of certain political affiliations, Loftus said that all depends on the state.\n\n\"For example, in Nebraska, rain deters Republicans more so than Democrats, however, I will say, for the majority of our models that we have tested, there is strong statistical significance that Republicans fare better during wet weather,\" he told Fox News. Loftus added that West Virginia, Rhode Island, Arizona, Indiana, and New Jersey are among the \"few\" states where this also occurs.\n\n\"Since weather may play a factor in Election Day tomorrow in certain areas, our best advice is for voters to track the weather on AccuWeather.com or download the free AccuWeather app to make the very best weather-related decisions when going to the polls,\" he said.\n\nStudies have also shown that how far work or home is from a polling place could impact voter turnout if the weather isn't great, especially if people have to travel on roads that are affected by a storm.\n\nThe type of weather can also be an issue, according to Dean. Besides roads that could be icy or snow-covered, people may be wary about waiting outside in lines to vote if there is severe weather in the forecast.\n\nIn extreme cases, weather can cause a delay in an election. In Bay County, Fla., which was devastated by Hurricane Michael in early October, voters have been given one extra day to cast their ballots in the midterm election. Election officials have set up voting \"supercenters\" because traditional polling stations and the staff to run them, just don't exist after the storm tore through the area.\n\n\"Thankfully, our forecast Tuesday, for the most part, should not dissuade too many voters, especially across the Western half of the country,\" Dean said Monday.\n\nFox News' Janice Dean and Samuel Chamberlain contributed to this report.", "Play Audio Clip Listen to audio clip.\n\nComedians Pat Dixon and Joe Machi join Tom Shillue to discuss the most important stories of the day including ...

In his first outright criticism of the uprising, he said last month it was the \"wrong remedy that followed a wrong diagnosis.\"\n\nBut his comments at the youth forum provided his most detailed assessment of the uprising, which pro-government media routinely demonize as a foreign conspiracy to destroy the country.\n\nThe 2011 uprising was led by young, pro-democracy activists, and paved the way for Egypt's first free and fair elections, which were won by the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group whose stalwart Mohammed Morsi was elected president in 2012. His rule proved divisive, and in 2013 el-Sissi, as defense minister, led the military overthrow of Morsi amid mass protests.\n\nSince then, the government has waged an unprecedented crackdown on dissent, jailing thousands of Islamists along with some of the most prominent activists behind the 2011 uprising. Authorities have rolled back all the freedoms gained through the uprising, banning unauthorized protests and silencing most independent media. El-Sissi was re-elected earlier this year in a vote in which all potentially viable opponents were either jailed or withdrew under pressure.\n\nHe has defended his actions by saying they spared Egypt the fate of Syria, Yemen and Libya, where Arab Spring uprisings led to civil war.\n\nOn Sunday, he said the uprising created a \"massive vacuum that only the evil people can fill\" and warned against a repeat. He said Egyptians and others in the region would be better off under \"not so good\" rulers than living through chaos.\n\n\"Work, be patient, endure and suffer under the reality that you disapprove of, but don't ruin your countries because they will never return to what they once were,\" he warned.\n\nSince taking office, el-Sissi has slashed costly state subsidies on basic goods and introduced new taxes while spending billions of dollars on infrastructure projects. His economic reforms helped Egypt secure $12 billion in bailout loans from the International Monetary Fund, but have caused a steep rise in the prices of food, fuel and services.\n\n\"After all the effort we have done, all that we are hoping for is that we go back to where we were before 2011,\" he said.", "Several members of a Georgia high school marching band are in hot water after the large letters attached to their sousaphones spelled out a racial slur during a halftime show Friday night.\n\nSome members of the Brookwood High School marching band use instrument covers that, when correctly lined up, spell out the school's nickname, \"Broncos.\" On Friday, however, some of the letters appeared rearranged and spelled out an anti-black slur.\n\nPrincipal Bo Ford said Monday in a statement that the matter was a prank: \u201cAs promised, we started an investigation into this matter, and I wanted to share with you our current findings and the steps we are taking with the students who were involved. After extensive interviews with many students, we have determined that three seniors intentionally planned and executed the use of the sousaphone covers to spell out a completely unacceptable, racist term. The fourth student, a junior, who carried one of the letters spelling out the word, appears to have gone along with the plan at the last minute. However, all four of the students knew what was going to happen and knew what they were spelling out during the halftime show. In our interviews, the students-- two of whom are African American, one of whom is Asian, and one of whom is Hispanic - indicated that this was intended as a joke, one that they thought would be funny. However, they acknowledged that they knew this racist term was not acceptable. We have identified two other students who do not appear to be involved in the planning and execution but did provide false information to school officials. All six of these students will receive discipline consequences commensurate with their involvement in this incident.\u201d\n\nFord previously had apologized to parents and the community in a letter, saying the halftime show was \u201churtful and disrespectful to audience members.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was also disappointing, as it does not reflect the standards and beliefs of our school and community,\u201d he went on to say, according to the Gwinnett Daily Post.\n\nThe sousaphone is a large horn instrument that wraps around the player. The band uses covers over the horn's mouth when sitting in the stands, but the covers should have been removed during the halftime performance, Ford said.\n\nNEWLYWEDS KILLED IN HELICOPTER CRASH LESS THAN 2 HOURS AFTER GETTING MARRIED\n\nHe said the activity on the field was \u201cvery busy\u201d and that \u201cseveral personnel challenges\u201d during the senior night activities resulted in the band\u2019s director not being on the field during the performance.\n\n\u201cWith that in mind, when the sousaphone players took the field, they did not follow band rules and normal practice, and instead, they left the covers on their instruments,\u201d Ford said.\n\nSome parents told Fox 5 they wanted to see the students who were responsible expelled.\n\nUNIVERSITY OFFICIAL 'REGRETS' SENDING ANTI-TRUMP EMAIL TO STUDENTS BEFORE ELECTION DAY\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re bold enough on senior night, that means your parents your grandparents are there\u2026you\u2019re bold enough to spell those words and stay there long enough to have everyone take pictures?\u201d Shawn Myers, whose son is a freshman in the marching band, told Fox 5. \u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt isn\u2019t a raccoon.

Farrakhan noted his belief America is conspiring against Iran.\n\nFarrakhan's trip coincided with the 39th anniversary of the 1979 seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, when more than 50 American diplomats and civilians were held hostage for 444 days. The incident kicked off the Islamic Revolution, and Farrakhan told an Iranian audience that black Americans should be considered among the revolutionaries. The infamous activist cited the actions of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeni, who ordered the release of black Americans among the 1979 captives.\n\nVideo of Farrakhan leading a \u201cDeath to America\u201d chant once again sparked calls for Democratic leaders to distance themselves from the controversial figure.

Piles reeking of rotting waste spill out of dumpsters and climb waist-high as garbage trucks fail to appear for days and even weeks.\n\nOne of the most basic functions of city government \u2014 trash collection \u2014 has become a serious problem in one of Latin America's most spectacular cities, which celebrates the 500th anniversary of its founding next year.\n\nIn the Atares neighborhood just outside Old Havana, Daysi Boza, 71, sleeps with a stick laid across the bottom of her door to keep out rats that feed on the trash spilling from the four big garbage bins feet from her door.\n\n\"I can't even remember how many years this has gone on,\" she said. \"Every day it's filthy, stinking \u2014 a pigsty.\"\n\nThe root cause appears to be the cash crunch affecting Cuba's entire government, leaving infrastructure crumbling, suppliers unpaid and state-run businesses without the inputs needed to produce basic goods.\n\nCuban officials blame the six-decade U.S. embargo for strangling its economy. The government's critics point to the inefficiency and pervasive small-scale corruption in one of the word's last centrally planned economies.\n\nOfficials say Havana has fewer than half of the 100 garbage trucks it needs to conduct daily trash pickups for the city's 2 million residents. Many of those trucks, mostly Chinese-made, regularly are out of service due to a lack of spare parts.\n\n\"I'm surprised \u2014 I expect to see crumbling buildings, but not so much trash,\" said Rosario Aneas, a 38-year-old art professor from Spain on a short trip to Cuba. \"It's affects the image of Cuba, mars it, and it's a shame for such a beautiful city.\"\n\nAggravating the problem is the fact that virtually no Havana residents use trash bags, which are difficult to find and even when available are hard to afford on a state salary of about $30 a month.\n\nInstead of bags, people collect trash in plastic paint buckets that they empty into dumpsters that sit on most street corners in Havana. Because the bins are filled with loose trash, they spill over and reeking garbage piles up as soon as a truck misses a few days' pickups.\n\nThe problem is so serious that Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has gotten involved, saying at a recent meeting that his government should look for foreign investors to help fix the trash crisis.\n\nHis administration hopes to create a $100 million company controlled by the Cuban government with a minority share held by foreign investors to handle Havana's 2,400 tons of daily trash, earning money by recycling and producing energy from landfill gas.\n\nForeign Investment Minister Rodrigo Malmierca told The Associated Press recently that the government had negotiated with a Spanish business but the talks fell through and Cuba is now talking with other potential partners.\n\nThe trash problem worsened after 2010 economic reforms that allowed Cubans to buy and sell houses and start small businesses in their homes. Instead of paying for professional carting as required by the city, many works crews simply dump sacks full of rubble alongside the nearest trash bin.\n\nMany Habaneros dump their domestic trash on top of the rubble, creating mountains of foul-smelling refuse.\n\n\"Some people throw bags of trash from the fifth floor window,\" said Luis Alberto Martinez, a 50-year-old messenger.\n\nThe head of the municipal government said in May that along with new trucks, Havana needed 12,000 new dumpsters to handle the trash problem.\n\nDozens of Cuban have been arrested in recent years for stealing the big metal bins and cutting them up in workshops to make improvised tubes and other goods in a country with shortages of virtually every product.\n\nCuban authorities say they are hopeful that 60 trash trucks donated by Japan will arrive by the end of the year to help alleviate the problem.\n\nMeanwhile, Habaneros on every side of the trash problem are growing frustrated.\n\n\"People are really undisciplined,\" said Victor Leon, a city worker in a crew of six men, some prisoners on work release, picking up trash that had fallen on the street as a garbage truck emptied bins in the Cerro neighborhood.\n\n\"We're cleaning up around the dumpsters, but you'll see, in 45 minutes this will look just as bad.\"\n\n___\n\nAndrea Rodr\u00edguez on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ARodriguezAP", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nAlexandru Visinescu, a Romanian communist-era prison guard serving a 20-year sentence for crimes against humanity, died Monday in prison at 93, Romanian authorities said.\n\nVisinescu was the first prison guard from the early years of communism to go on trial in Romania.

He was imprisoned in February 2016 after losing his appeal.\n\nFormer prisoners under Visinescu testified that they were denied access to medical treatment, heating, exercise and adequate food. They were held in solitary confinement and beatings were common. The prison housed members of Romania's intellectual, political and military elite.\n\n\"He annihilated his victims in a sadistic program of physical and mental alienation, total isolation combined with physical torture,\" said Muraru.\n\nDuring his trial, Visinescu showed no remorse and insisted he was only following orders.

It wasn\u2019t her first near-arrest, nor would it be her last.\n\nSepideh, a self-described artist and poet from Alborz province, vowed she, too, is part of the \u201cresistance units,\" and \u201cconstantly takes part in protests and uprisings against the repression of this criminal regime.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is for freedom, equality, and justice \u2013 things that I have never experienced in 37 years of my life. I am a poet and yet am not allowed to publish my poems in Iran,\u201d Sepideh lamented. \u201cThe Iranian women have faced the most severe injustices and pains. The pain and suffering of my people, my nation, are my pains. One day I said to myself that I have to take a stand and put everything, including my life, on the line to overthrow this despicable regime.\u201d\n\nSepideh said she constantly \u201ctakes part in protests and uprisings against the repression,\u201d and takes on tasks such as putting up banners, distributing opposition leaflets.\n\n\u201cOn several occasions, I have gone to the brink of being arrested. One of the regime\u2019s mercenaries kicked me to the ground and took away my mobile phone,\u201d she recounted, referring to Labor Day protests in May. \u201cWith the intervention of others on the scene, I was able to run away.\u201d\n\nPhotographs of the women could not be published for safety reasons, with each fearing apprehension by authorities. They are all considered by the regime to be connected to a terrorist movement: The controversial Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK) \u2013 also referred to as the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI).\n\nThe Paris-based opposition group, which was once a U.S.-designated terror group, and is still top of Tehran\u2019s terror list, provokes deep divisions among Iranians.\n\nThe Iranian leadership has long classified MEK as a terrorist organization, not only for its present opposition but for siding with Saddam Hussein during the devastating Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. The Iranian government also blames the MEK for the deaths of more than 12,000 Iranians over the past three decades.\n\n\"Most of the country who don't like the clerical order want to see more democracy rather than another political elite dominating the country,\" surmised Kamran Bokhari, a specialist on the geopolitics of the Middle East with the University of Ottawa's Professional Development Institute, noting that he has \"found no evidence\" of widespread support for the controversial political opposition from within Iran.\n\nThe MEK was designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department in 1997 but was removed from the list in 2012. Eight years earlier, then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld designated the group as civilian \"protected persons\" under the Geneva Convention. Today it heralds support from the likes of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, National Security Adviser John Bolton and James Jones, National Security Adviser to former President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time I see hope that there can be real change in Iran,\u201d Giuliani has said of his affinity for the organization.\n\nBURMA'S KAREN REFUGEES FACE DWINDLING AID, STRUGGLE WITH DEPRESSION AND SUICIDES\n\nCOLOMBIAN MOTHERS CHALLENGE 'BAD LUCK' TABOOS, TAKE THE LEAD EMERALD MINING\n\nNonetheless, a spate of protests has taken place across Iran for most of the year, attended by those with and without any broader political affiliation. And as they have in the past, women have been crucial players in many of those demonstrations.\n\nAs a result, Iran\u2019s Ministry of Intelligence and the Revolutionary Guards have arrested and summoned droves of women perceived to be dissidents over the years \u2013 including lawyers, teachers, sociologists, students, and stay-at-home mothers. As the numbers of arrests grew, so too did concerns over the conditions in which they are being held. Stories of torture, rape, physical abuse, sleep deprivation, and solitary confinement have long trickled out of Iran\u2019s penal establishments.\n\nAccording to the most recent statistics provided by World Prison Brief, more than 230,000 people are behind bars in Iran. And 3.1 percent, or around 7,130, are female. At least 9000 are estimated to have been arrested over the year, with some 1000 during the month of August alone.\n\n\u201cThere are so many women activists in the prisons,\u201d Sepideh stressed. \u201cI know what I am doing. I know all the dangers, but will continue this fight.\u201d\n\nTehran government officials have routinely dismissed protests as insignificantly small, and say that the opposition groups behind them are being orchestrated from the outside, by the United States and Saudi Arabia - Iran's greatest rival in the region.\n\nAs for how the renewed sanctions will impact Iranians and their support of opposition groups, experts say it's too soon to say.\n\n\u201cSanctions are bound to exacerbate Iran\u2019s economic situation and stoke discontent,\" cautioned Ali Vaez, Director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group. \u201cThere might be protests in the coming months. But the country does not seem to be in a pre-revolutionary phase, as there is no viable alternative to the existing regime, which for its part retains the will and a fearsome capability to repress. The Iranian opposition in exile remains in disarray.\"\n\nIn preparing Iranians for the renewed sanctions, Rouhani last week said the country faces challenging times ahead, but insisted the government will do its best to allay the hardships and \u201cinjustice\u201d from the U.S. Mass demonstrations took place in Tehran and other major cities over the weekend, in which the US flag was burned as hundred expressed their grievances as the sanctions came into effect.\n\nYet those who support the Trump administration's hardline approach insist only the regime \u2013 not the people \u2013 will be brought to the brink. U.S officials have vowed that the goal is to dramatically curtail Iran\u2019s oil exports and drive the Tehran leadership to its knees.\n\n\u201cWe will place tough sanctions on #Iran\u2019s ruling regime. Our aim is to compel Iran to abandon its destructive activities,\u201d tweeted U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \u201cThe sanctions will target the regime\u2014not the people, who have suffered the pain of their government\u2019s mismanagement, theft, and brutality.\u201d\n\nAnd at least a portion of Iranian women \u2013 quietly and not-so-quietly \u2013 are on board with that.\n\n\u201cDespite all the pressures and difficulties, we will not tire.

LiDAR uses a laser to measure distances to the Earth\u2019s surface and can prove extremely valuable to study areas with thick vegetation.

It was a late twist to a saga that has contributed to the administration's unpopularity.\n\nThe center-left Social Democrats, part of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition, demanded Hans-Georg Maassen's removal from the BfV spy agency in September after he appeared to downplay far-right violence against migrants in the eastern city of Chemnitz.\n\nThe haggling that followed reflected poorly on a coalition already notorious for squabbling. Its leaders first agreed to make Maassen a deputy interior minister, technically a promotion with a pay rise, but renegotiated the deal in the face of a backlash.\n\nThey then agreed to make him a \"special adviser\" to Interior Minister Horst Seehofer.\n\nOn Monday, Seehofer said that he was sending the 55-year-old Maassen into early retirement instead. That was prompted, he said, by the manuscript of a speech in which Maassen used \"unacceptable formulations\" that made continuing to work with him impossible \"in whatever function.\"\n\nSeehofer said that Thomas Haldenwang, Maassen's deputy at the BfV, will take on Maassen's duties until there is a decision on a permanent successor.\n\nGerman media reported that, in the manuscript of a farewell speech to European counterparts in mid-October, Maassen alleged that \"radical left-wing forces\" in the Social Democrats wanted to use his comments as an excuse to end a governing coalition they never wanted to join.\n\nHe also said that he was known as a \"critic of idealistic, naive and left-wing policy on foreigners and security.\" Seehofer said those remarks \"crossed a line.\"\n\nSeehofer, the leader of the conservative Christian Social Union party, had previously defended Maassen. He said he heard about the speech on Friday and was \"personally disappointed.\"\n\nThe saga started with Maassen's response to violent right-wing protests following the killing of a German man, allegedly by migrants, in Chemnitz. Maassen said his agency had no reliable evidence that foreigners had been \"hunted\" down in the streets \u2014 a term Merkel had used.\n\nA video posted by a left-wing group showed protesters chasing down and attacking a foreigner, but Maassen questioned its authenticity.", "A fisherman was rescued Monday from the cliffside perch where he hid during a harrowing encounter with 50 aggressive grey seals on a Scottish beach, officials said.\n\nThe Maritime and Coastguard Agency on Monday said the fisherman, who was not identified, was walking on a beach in southeastern Scotland late last week when he came across the group of seals and their young pups -- who quickly became agitated and aggressive.\n\nTo escape, the fisherman started climbing up the face of a cliff, but he soon found himself trapped and unable to reach the top. The fisherman, however, had a cell phone handy and called for help.\n\nCoast Guard rescue teams from four locations responded and used rope rescue techniques to safely extract the man from the cliff and into a lifeboat waiting below.

In a lengthy statement, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said there will be \"very tight restrictions\" placed on its distribution and it is intended only for supervised settings like hospitals.\n\nThe tiny pill was developed as an option for patients who pose difficulties for the use of IVs, including soldiers on the battlefield. The pill from AcelRx Pharmaceuticals contains the same decades-old painkiller often given in IV form or injection to surgical patients and women in labor.\n\nGottlieb noted the pill was a high priority for the Department of Defense, which helped fund testing, because it wanted a way to provide fast pain relief to injured soldiers. The tablet, placed under the tongue with a dispenser, starts reducing pain in 15 to 30 minutes.\n\nThis drug is doomed. It's dangerous and it will kill people. \u2014 Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen's Health Research Group\n\nA panel of FDA advisers had earlier voted 10-3 in favor of the pill called Dsuvia (duh-SOO'-vee-uh). But in a rare response, the panel's chairman joined critics in urging the FDA to reject it. The chairman, Dr. Raeford E. Brown Jr., who couldn't attend the meeting and didn't cast a vote, predicts that the pill will be abused inside and outside medical settings and cause overdose deaths.\n\nThe pills contain sufentanil, a chemical cousin of the opioid fentanyl.\n\nGottlieb said the drug will carry a boxed warning and won't be available at drugstores for patients to take home. Acknowledging the criticism, he said he's asked FDA staff to \"evaluate a new framework\" for the approval of new opioid drugs that will clearly outline how the agency considers benefits and risks.\n\n\"We won't sidestep what I believe is the real underlying source of discontent among the critics of this approval \u2014 the question of whether or not America needs another powerful opioid while in the throes of a massive crisis of addiction,\" Gottlieb's wrote.\n\nSidney Wolfe of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a consumer group, called Gottlieb's statement \"empty rhetoric\" and said the agency missed a big opportunity when it approved the pill.\n\n\"It's a huge mistake,\" Wolfe said. \"This drug is doomed. It's dangerous and it will kill people.\"\n\nThe Redwood City, California-based company expects the pill to be available early next year at a price of $50 to $60 per pill.\n\nIn one study, the pill provided about the same pain relief to patients as IV morphine.

Nashieli Ramirez, ombudsman for the city's human rights commission, said the migrants would be able to stay at the stadium as long as necessary.\n\n\"We have the space in terms of humanitarian help,\" Ramirez said.\n\nIn a thundering voice vote late Sunday at a gymnasium in Cordoba, in the Gulf state of Veracruz, hundreds of the estimated 4,000 migrants in the lead caravan voted to strike out for the capital, eager to leave a part of the country that has long been treacherous for migrants trying to get to the United States. Cordoba is 178 miles (286 kilometers) from Mexico City by the shortest route, which would be the group's longest single-day journey yet since they began more than three weeks ago.\n\nBut the group encountered obstacles Monday.

Rodas was trying to get Sergio Cazares, a 40-year-old paraplegic from Honduras, to the U.S. for an operation that Cazares hopes will allow him to walk again.\n\nMost of the weary caravan participants camped Sunday in Cordoba, a colonial city in the Veracruz sugar belt. But they were eager to divert toward Mexico City from Veracruz, a state where hundreds of migrants have disappeared in recent years, falling prey to kidnappers looking for ransom payments. They are still more than 600 miles from the U.S. border.\n\nThey hope to regroup in the Mexican capital, seeking medical care and rest while awaiting stragglers. The caravan has found strength in numbers as it meanders north, with townspeople coming out to offer food, water, fresh clothes and replacement footwear.\n\nIt is unclear what part of the U.S. border the caravan will aim for eventually, or how many may splinter off on their own. Several hundred have pushed ahead to the central city of Puebla, while more streamed into Mexico City on Monday. Some stopped at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a major pilgrimage site in the capital, to thank the Virgin Mary for watching over them during the voyage.\n\nMany of the migrants said they remain convinced that traveling together is their best hope for reaching the U.S. The migrants generally say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\nYuri Juarez, 42, said he thinks there's a \"very low\" chance he will get asylum in the United States. But he said he had no way to work back home in Villanueva, Guatemala, where he closed his internet cafe after gang members extorted him, then robbed his customers and finally stole his computers.\n\nMexico faces the unprecedented situation of having three migrant caravans stretched over 300 miles (500 kilometers) of highway in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz. The largest group has been followed by about 1,000 who crossed over from Guatemala last week and a second group of about the same size that waded over the Suchiate River on Friday.\n\nMexico's Interior Ministry estimated over the weekend that there are more than 5,000 migrants in total currently moving through southern Mexico via the caravans or in smaller groups. The ministry said 2,793 migrants have applied for refugee status in Mexico in recent weeks and around 500 have asked for assistance to return to their home countries.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has ordered U.S. troops to the Mexican border in response to the caravans, with more than 7,000 active duty troops earmarked to deploy to Texas, Arizona and California.

But unofficial results reported in Polish media already show that in 107 of the country's cities and largest towns, the ruling Law and Justice party is expected to win only six mayor's seats, the largest of which is Zamosc, population 65,000.\n\nIt is a sign that Law and Justice, while still popular with its conservative rural base after winning a national election in 2015, struggles to find support in urban areas despite a booming economy and cash handouts to families.\n\nFor now, the ruling party seems unlikely to win the super majority in the parliament that it seeks in Poland's national elections in 2019 in order to change the constitution.\n\nIn the first round of local voting on Oct. 21, an opposition coalition led by the centrist Civic Platform won outright in the capital, Warsaw, and in other key cities including Poznan and Lodz.\n\nIn runoff races on Sunday, opposition politicians followed up with landslide victories in other prestigious cities, including Krakow, Gdansk and Kielce.\n\nPolish media described the results as a clear defeat for Law and Justice, and the opposition was celebrating Monday.

Whenever possible, the migrants discard damaged footwear, replacing them with donated shoes found at stops along the way or with spare pairs they carry in backpacks.\n\nThe most grueling days demand treks of more than 100 miles (160 kilometers). Migrants eager to find strength in numbers must keep that pace to remain with the group.

AP writer Sonia Perez D. in Cordoba contributed to this report.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nThousands of exhausted migrants from the Central American caravan trudged along highways Monday toward Mexico City, where officials prepared a sports stadium to accommodate them as they try to reach the U.S. border still hundreds of miles away.\n\nThe first wave of more than 500 migrants spent Sunday night on concrete benches at the Jesus Martinez stadium, where they were served hot meals as authorities prepared to receive as many as 5,000 migrants from the lead caravan and several smaller ones hundreds of miles behind it. Nashieli Ramirez, ombudsman for the city's human rights commission, said the migrants would be able to stay at the stadium as long as necessary.\n\n\"We have the space in terms of humanitarian help,\" Ramirez said.\n\nIn a thundering voice vote late Sunday at a gymnasium in Cordoba, in the Gulf state of Veracruz, hundreds of the estimated 4,000 migrants in the lead caravan voted to strike out for the capital, eager to leave a part of the country that has long been treacherous for migrants trying to get to the United States. Cordoba is 178 miles (286 kilometers) from Mexico City by the shortest route, which would be the group's longest single-day journey yet since they began more than three weeks ago.\n\nBut the group encountered obstacles Monday. Truck after truck denied the migrants rides as they trudged miles along the highway, experiencing a taste of the colder weather of central Mexico. At a toll booth near Fortin, Veracruz, Rafael Leyva, an unemployed cobbler from Honduras, stood with a few hundred others for more than 45 minutes without finding a ride.\n\n\"People help more in Chiapas and Oaxaca,\" Leyva reflected, referring to the southern Mexican states the group had already traversed and where pickup trucks frequently stopped to offer rides.\n\nMigrants were seen grouping in front of tractor trailers, forcing the big rigs to stop so that fellow migrants could climb aboard.\n\nThis impromptu ridesharing is precarious, with dozens scrambling onto vehicles at a time, and leaves some behind. And police will force the migrants off vehicles if the drivers complain.\n\nCesar Rodas, 24, had pushed a friend's wheelchair along with the caravan for 24 days across three countries. But he couldn't lift his friend and the chair onto a truck bed crammed with 150 migrants. Rodas was trying to get Sergio Cazares, a 40-year-old paraplegic from Honduras, to the U.S. for an operation that Cazares hopes will allow him to walk again.\n\nMost of the weary caravan participants camped Sunday in Cordoba, a colonial city in the Veracruz sugar belt. But they were eager to divert toward Mexico City from Veracruz, a state where hundreds of migrants have disappeared in recent years, falling prey to kidnappers looking for ransom payments. They are still more than 600 miles from the U.S. border.\n\nThey hope to regroup in the Mexican capital, seeking medical care and rest while awaiting stragglers. The caravan has found strength in numbers as it meanders north, with townspeople coming out to offer food, water, fresh clothes and replacement footwear.\n\nIt is unclear what part of the U.S. border the caravan will aim for eventually, or how many may splinter off on their own. Several hundred have pushed ahead to the central city of Puebla, while more streamed into Mexico City on Monday. Some stopped at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a major pilgrimage site in the capital, to thank the Virgin Mary for watching over them during the voyage.\n\nMany of the migrants said they remain convinced that traveling together is their best hope for reaching the U.S. The migrants generally say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\nYuri Juarez, 42, said he thinks there's a \"very low\" chance he will get asylum in the United States. But he said he had no way to work back home in Villanueva, Guatemala, where he closed his internet cafe after gang members extorted him, then robbed his customers and finally stole his computers.\n\nMexico faces the unprecedented situation of having three migrant caravans stretched over 300 miles (500 kilometers) of highway in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz. The largest group has been followed by about 1,000 who crossed over from Guatemala last week and a second group of about the same size that waded over the Suchiate River on Friday.\n\nMexico's Interior Ministry estimated over the weekend that there are more than 5,000 migrants in total currently moving through southern Mexico via the caravans or in smaller groups. The ministry said 2,793 migrants have applied for refugee status in Mexico in recent weeks and around 500 have asked for assistance to return to their home countries.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has ordered U.S. troops to the Mexican border in response to the caravans, with more than 7,000 active duty troops earmarked to deploy to Texas, Arizona and California. Trump plans to sign an order that could lead to the large-scale detention of migrants crossing the southern border and bar anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amy Guthrie in Mexico City contributed to this report.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nA battery of corruption allegations and criminal charges against former President Cristina Fernandez hasn't fazed a strong band of hard-core backers, who have helped make her a leading \u2014 if undeclared \u2014 contender to regain power in next year's elections.\n\nHundreds of supporters, some waving signs saying, \"Strength, Cristina!\" thronged the street outside when investigators searched the former president's apartment recently.\n\nCries of support for Fernandez rise from crowds during protests against the austerity policies of the conservative who replaced her as president, Mauricio Macri.\n\n\"Now more than ever, soldiers of Cristina\" read a sign at a demonstration demanding improved conditions for disabled retirees.\n\n\"Many women voted for the government of Mauricio Macri and now they regret it,\" Teresa Rollano said while walking arm-in-arm with a friend who carried that sign. \"The people want Cristina because she represents the working class. She has given us all of our rights.\"\n\nA recent survey by local pollster Ricardo Rouvier & Associates said Fernandez is neck-and-neck with Macri in terms of support ahead of the October 2019 election.\n\nThat's remarkable backing for a politician who faces numerous formal investigations into alleged bribery, money laundering and criminal association during her own administration from 2007 to 2015 and that of her late husband Nestor Kirchner from 2003 to 2007.\n\nFernandez, now a senator, hasn't been convicted of any crimes \u2014 a first trial is scheduled to start in February \u2014 and she fiercely denies any wrongdoing, accusing officials of persecuting her to distract from the current economic crisis.\n\nBut the Argentine press has been filled with picturesque scandals: bags of millions of dollars in cash tossed over a convent wall, the mysterious death of a prosecutor who accused Fernandez of a cover-up, the corruption conviction of her former vice president.\n\nPart of her strength stems from disenchantment with Macri, whose budget-cutting efforts have forced thousands out of public jobs, raised electricity bills and hiked bus fares without managing to revive the economy or rein in soaring prices. His decision this year to seek IMF aid to help has roused fears among those who blame the international agency for a devastating economic crash in 2001, when Argentina's government was forced into the largest debt default in history to that point and millions of Argentines were plunged into poverty.\n\nMany credit Kirchner and Fernandez for leading the country out of that crisis, even if Macri's backers blame Fernandez's policies for eventually creating the country's current woes.\n\nUnder Fernandez, \"I was able to buy a new car, fix my house and travel on a plane for the first time,\" said Gloria Buffarini, a hairdresser. \"I used to pay 600 pesos a month (about $16) for electricity. Now, it's 3,000 (about $80).\n\nFernandez's supporters credit her for nationalizing the pension system, keeping energy cheap through subsidies and redirecting revenue to the poor through handouts, and see her as a trailblazer for women's advancement.\n\nThe former president's appeal also flows from her leadership of a powerful \u2014 if often fragmented \u2014 populist tide in Argentine politics that originated with strongman Juan Domingo Peron in the 1940s and from progressive social policies she passed in the face of opposition from powerful business interests.\n\nBut she also inspires deep animosity. Detractors blame her for endemic corruption and the deterioration of Argentina's economy, which was choked by restrictions on imports, exports and foreign currency exchanges in the latter part of her administration.\n\n\"Not since Peron has there been another leader who has generated such a situation of love and hate,\" said Mariel Fornoni of the Management & Fit consultancy. She said Fernandez has a \"hard core of followers who are going to vote for her no matter what she does.\"\n\nFernandez infuriates people like Patricio Canbelari, a language teacher, who said, \"Most want to see her arrested,\" and called her a \"white-gloved thief.\"\n\nFernandez's former public works secretary was arrested in 2016 when he was caught tossing bags containing more than $9 million over the walls of a convent. He later agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, joining other witnesses in accusing Fernandez and her son of overseeing a plan to skim millions of dollars from public works projects.\n\nJudges also are investigating allegations published by the newspaper La Nacion that a senior official's chauffeur kept detailed diaries of millions of dollars in cash payments, including some delivered to the presidential offices and to Fernandez's private home.\n\nFernandez, along with other former officials, also faces trial on charges that she covered up the role of Iranians in a 1994 terrorist bombing at a Jewish center in Argentina's capital. The prosecutor who first recommended charges against her, Alberto Nisman, died mysteriously of a gunshot wound four days later \u2014 a case that is still under investigation.\n\nFernandez's former vice president, Amado Boudou, is in prison, appealing a sentence for bribery and business incompatible with his public office. He was accused of using shell companies and middlemen to take over the only company with contracts to print Argentina's currency.\n\nFernandez's Senate seat grants her immunity from arrest but not from prosecution. That immunity could be lifted only by an unlikely vote of two-thirds of the country's senators. While a conviction might theoretically bar her from running for office, that would only occur after appeals were exhausted \u2014 a process that would take many years.\n\nFornoni said some Argentines believe that although corruption was rife during Fernandez's term, it exists in Macri's government as well.\n\n\"They say: 'They were probably corrupt, but I lived better,'\" Fornoni said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalist Paul Byrne contributed to this report.", "Play Audio Clip Listen to audio clip.\n\nOn the eve of one of the most highly contested midterms in history, The FOX News Rundown focuses in on two important races.

We are going to stay with it and respect the organizers,\" said Luis Euseda, a 32-year-old from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, traveling with his wife, Jessica Fugon. \"Others went ahead, maybe they have no goal, but we do have a goal and it is to arrive.\"\n\nMynor Chavez, a 19-year-old from Copan, Honduras, was also determined to continue.\n\n\"I have no prospects (in Honduras). I graduated as a computer technician and not even with a degree have I been able to find work,\" he said of his home country.\n\nManuel Calderon, 43, a migrant from El Salvador, lifted his shirt to show scars from two bullets he said pierced his torso in his home country. He dreams of making it back to the U.S., from which he was deported a little more than two years ago.\n\nOn the road, Calderon was received by ordinary Mexicans lending a hand. Catalina Munoz said she bought tortillas on credit to assemble tacos of beans, cheese and rice when she heard the migrant caravan would pass through her tiny town of 3,000 inhabitants. She gathered 15 others to help make the tacos, fill water bottles and carry fruit to weary travelers on the roadside.\n\nMexico faces the unprecedented situation of having three migrant caravans stretched over 300 miles (500 kilometers) of highway in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz.\n\nOn Friday, a caravan from El Salvador waded over the Suchiate River into Mexico, bringing around 1,000 people who want to reach the U.S. border. That caravan initially tried to cross the bridge between Guatemala and Mexico, but Mexican authorities told them they would have to show passports and visas and enter in groups of 50 for processing.\n\nAnother caravan, also of about 1,000 people, entered Mexico early last week. That group includes Hondurans, Salvadorans and some Guatemalans.\n\nThe first, and largest, group of mainly Honduran migrants entered Mexico on Oct. 19.\n\nMexican officials have appeared conflicted over whether to help or hinder their journey.\n\nMexico's Interior Ministry estimated Saturday that there are more than 5,000 migrants in total currently moving through southern Mexico via caravans or in smaller groups. The ministry says 2,793 migrants have pursued refugee status in Mexico in recent weeks and around 500 have asked for assistance to return to their countries of origin.\n\nUncertainty awaits migrants who reach the U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has ordered U.S. troops to the Mexican border in response to the caravans. More than 7,000 active duty troops have been told to deploy to Texas, Arizona and California ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nHe plans to sign an order that could lead to the large-scale detention of migrants crossing the southern border and bar anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amy Guthrie in Mexico City contributed to this report."]
