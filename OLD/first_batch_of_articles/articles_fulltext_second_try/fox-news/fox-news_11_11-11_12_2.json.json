RUSSIAN NATIONALS, FMR TRUMP CAMPAIGN CHAIR, AND MORE\n\n\"I fully anticipate that in the next few days I will be indicted by Mueller for some form or other of giving false information to the special counsel or to one of the other grand jury -- or however they want to do the indictment. But I'm going to be criminally charged,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"This has been one of the most frightening experiences of my life. At the end of the two months, my mind was mush.\"\n\nCorsi, who wrote the anti-President Obama book \"The Obama Nation,\" said he is being targeted for political reasons.\n\nSeveral of those ensnared by Mueller's probe have faced indictments and convictions for matters unrelated to any illegal collusion with the Russian government. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, for example, was convicted of unrelated bank fraud and tax crimes that stemmed from his earlier business dealings with Ukrainian officials. U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III, who presided over Manafort's first federal trial, openly accused prosecutors of targeting Manafort to get to Trump.\n\n\"My crime was that I dared to support Donald Trump.\" \u2014 Jerome Corsi\n\n\"Criminals are running the Department of Justice. My crime was that I dared to support Donald Trump,\" Corsi said in the livestream. \"And that supporting President Trump, and since 2004 having written 20 books -- I guess those were my crimes. I guess I'm going to prison for the rest of my life because I dared to oppose the deep state.\"\n\nHe then lamented that he'll \"die in prison\" because of a \"perjury trap,\" in which he said he was interrogated by authorities with a massive binder full of information and was \"quizzed\" about various highly specific topics several times for months.\n\nMeanwhile, Corsi associate and political operative Roger Stone last week revealed that Mueller is probing \"whether I somehow directed or urged Wikileaks to release the allegedly hacked e-mails from the DNC in the wake of the Billy Bush accusations against Trump on Oct. 7.\"\n\nStone was unequivocal: \"I did not \u2014 and there is no evidence to the contrary,\" he wrote. \"In fact, Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange announced his release schedule on Oct. 2.\"\n\nCorsi on Monday denied knowing anything about Assange or the emails the organization leaked during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nSCHUMER THREATENS TO ADD MUELLER PROTECTIONS TO SPENDING BILL\n\nTwo sources close to the president's legal team told Fox News prior to the midterm elections they believe the Mueller probe is \"winding down,\" echoing other reporting that the investigation is coming to a close.\n\nBut Corsi told his viewers that he expects his problems are just starting up. He announced that he has set up a Paypal to help him defray legal expenses, and said he expects to lose his home.\n\n\"I expect this is just going to be the beginning,\" Corsi said on his livestream.\n\nThe development comes as former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty earlier this year to a variety of federal charges including tax evasion and making false statements to a financial institution, was spotted in Washington, D.C. by reporters. It was not immediately clear if Cohen, who took a plea deal with New York prosecutors as his business dealings in New York came under scrutiny, was there to speak to Mueller's team.\n\nCohen's guilty plea to breaking campaign finance law by arranging hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal \u201cat the direction\u201d of then-candidate Trump drew the most media attention, although legal analysts (including a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission) said it was unclear whether Trump himself -- or even Cohen -- could have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt to have actually violated the law.

Around 3.5 million Syrian refugees are estimated to be on Turkish territory.\n\nThe EU has hailed the agreement with Turkey as a great success as it has helped slash migrant arrival numbers. However, many migrants are still languishing in terrible conditions on the Greek islands.\n\nThe bloc wants to replicate versions of the agreement with countries in northern Africa as it seeks to stop migrants setting out on dangerous voyages in rickety boats across the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nAsked whether the EU refugee money in Turkey has been well spent, Jakobson said \"I think so, yes.

Chahed needed 109 votes to keep his government from collapsing.\n\nChahed pleaded for \"political stability the nation needs to overcome difficulties,\" notably economic and social, ahead of 2019 legislative and presidential elections.\n\nJoblessness is above 15 percent, inflation is nearly 8 percent and trade and other deficits are chronic in the North African nation. The budding democracy, also coping with extremist attacks, is having trouble overcoming political problems despite major strides since autocratic leader Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was toppled in 2011.\n\nChahed, 41, incurred new anger among detractors a week ago, including from the Tunisian president and the prime minister's prime political enemy, the president's son, with his appointment of 19 new Cabinet ministers. The changes were aimed at \"ending the political crisis,\" he said, but the reshuffle exacerbated enmity from his opponents.\n\nThe office of President Beji Caid Essebsi, who chose Chahed for the job of prime minister in 2016, said the president was informed of the changes \"very late\" and by mail.\n\nThe president's son, Hafedh, who has risen to the top of the Nida Tounes party created by his father, has for months been in open conflict with Chahed, a one-time party figure.\n\nThe powerful UGTT union has also demanded \"profound changes in the government\" \u2014 including its leader.\n\nThe friction has kept the government from tending to the nation's business, and the daily concerns of Tunisians.\n\nWhile naming a new justice minister, Karim Jamoussi, Chahed made no changes to key ministries like interior or defense. He also brought some surprise faces into the government, notably a Tunisian Jew, Rene Trabelsi, as tourism minister, a first in more than 50 years \u2014 and one topic that raised questions during Monday's debate. He also named as minister of public function Kamel Morjane, who served as defense and foreign minister under the now-toppled Ben Ali.", "The president of Afghanistan told a U.S. audience Monday that his country is not losing the war to the Taliban and is not at risk of collapse amid escalating attacks by the militant group and an expansion of the territory it controls.\n\nPresident Ashraf Ghani said his administration is intent on seeking a negotiated peace with the Taliban, which have shown no interest in direct talks with a government they see as illegitimate.\n\n\"The Taliban are not in a winning position,\" Ghani said by video to an audience at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Washington as a suicide bombing in Kabul and a deadly militant assault on districts in eastern Afghanistan suggested government control was slipping further.\n\nGhani said that more than 28,000 Afghan forces have been killed in the past four years but that the military will be able to retake territory as long as it has an air force and commando troops. He said most of the losses incurred by its security forces were in defending static positions, so the government was rethinking how it deploys its forces.\n\nSpeaking on Veterans Day, the Afghan leader paid tribute to American sacrifices in Afghanistan, including the death of Brent Taylor, a Utah mayor serving as a major in the state's Army National Guard who was training Afghan commandos. Taylor, 39, was fatally shot a week ago by one of his Afghan trainees.\n\nBut Ghani also offered a rare public accounting of the scale of the Afghan losses. He described how their casualties have risen sharply while U.S.-led coalition casualties have declined after Afghan forces assumed responsibility for combat operations in the country. He said that since 2015, 58 American forces have died in Afghanistan.\n\n\"In the same period, 28,529 of our security forces have lost their lives and become martyrs,\" he said.\n\nU.S. military officials have previously indicated that Afghan casualties have been increasing, but they have avoided giving hard figures, apparently because of political sensitivities.\n\nIn its most recent report to Congress, in October, the special inspector general for Afghanistan said Afghan casualty numbers had been reported only in classified form since September 2017 because the U.S. military command in Kabul said it had stopped making them public at the request of the Afghan government. However, the report said that the average number of casualties between May and October this year was the greatest it has ever been during similar periods.\n\nOn Oct. 30, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Afghan forces had more than 1,000 dead and wounded during August and September alone, \"and they stayed in the field fighting.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has marginally increased U.S. troop numbers to train Afghan forces and intensify military pressure on the Taliban in hopes of forcing the insurgents to negotiate an end to the 17-year conflict. Successes on the battlefield have been elusive. The inspector general report said the number of districts under Afghan government control and influence has declined and stands at just 55 percent \u2014 down 16 percentage points in the past three years.\n\nU.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad is on his second tour of the region in a month, seeking to kick-start a peace process. The diplomatic veteran is making stops in Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office. The insurgents say they met Khalilzad in Qatar last month. The Taliban have so far refused direct negotiations with Kabul, which they view as a U.S. puppet.\n\nOn the sensitive topic of the U.S. role in talks, Ghani said there was \"total agreement\" between the U.S. and Afghan governments on moving the peace process forward.\n\n\"U.S. engagement is to ensure that talks with the Taliban result not in negotiations with Taliban but with talks, direct talks, between the Afghan government and the Taliban,\" he said.\n\nHe insisted that the Afghan government was seeking a negotiated peace but would not do so \"from a position of weakness.\"\n\nIn a possible sign of America's efforts, Pakistan released two Taliban officials on Monday, members of the militant group said. Abdul Samad Sani, a U.S.-designated terrorist who served as the Afghan Central Bank governor during the militants' rule in the late 1990s, and a lower-ranking commander named Salahuddin, were freed, according to two Taliban officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media.\n\nGhani, however, said Pakistan has yet to demonstrate a \"sense of urgency\" in seeking an end to the Afghan conflict and a change in its policies.\n\nKabul has long protested that Afghan Taliban leaders and fighters enjoy sanctuary inside Pakistan, which Islamabad denies.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Robert Burns contributed to this report.", "", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nThe Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressed deep concern over human rights in Brazil on Monday, saying it will monitor what happens when the government of President-elect Jair Bolsonaro assumes office Jan. 1.\n\nAfter a one-week visit to eight states in Latin America's biggest country, the commission released a report highlighting violence suffered by indigenous people, the growing exclusion of those living on the streets, threats against freedom of expression, the vulnerability of minorities, and a culture of impunity among police.\n\n\"Killings committed by security forces must end.

Many became seasick on the way to the beachhead due to rough seas, and incoming enemy fire forced many soldiers to swim for more than 200 yards offshore, carrying at least 50 pounds of supplies.\n\nThe overall Navy mission at Utah Beach, which included the Army\u2019s 82nd Airborne, 101st Airborne and 4th Infantry Division, not only required supporting the initial landing and attack mission but also a need to sustain support as troops fought inland.\n\n\u201cThey were not only off-loading troops but bringing supplies in and keeping them supplied once they dropped the troops off. The Navy worked to keep the supply lines open for food, ammunition and other supplies,\u201d Guy Nasuti, Naval History and Heritage Command historian, told Warrior Maven in an interview.\n\nAlso, landing craft carrying armored vehicles such as tanks, had engine trouble and were overloaded, forcing them to drop troops farther away from the shore than they had initially planned. Some of the armored vehicles were so badly affected that many of them had trouble maintaining their role in the close-fire support plan. Considerable damage was inflicted on the smaller types of landing craft, according to the Navy.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Allied air bombardment and counter-battery fire from ships prevented the Germans from disrupting much of the landing. Furthermore, by deliberately placing themselves in less visible defensive positions, German fighters themselves had difficulty seeing and targeting the approaching force, the Naval Heritage and History Command text explains.\n\nDeparting the Landing Craft Infantry (LCI) vessel, amphibious craft that carried up to 200 soldiers at-a-time, was necessary to prevent Germans from clearly seeing aggregated, or condensed, targets during the approach to shore. However, despite heavy casualties and the perils of a mission of this kind, the operation at Utah Beach was successful.\n\nIn the Navy\u2019s text, Ramsay identifies several key factors for this, a key element of which was a large absence of German Luftwaffe planes able to conduct reconnaissance missions.\n\n\u201cThe cover and deception plan; the bad weather, which caused the enemy to withdraw his E-boat patrols to Cherbourg; and, finally, the radio counter-measures employed by our forces,\u201d were all factors leading to the Allied victory during the operation, said Ramsay.\n\nAs expected, amphibious forces approaching the beachhead were hit with German artillery, mortars and small-arms fire.\n\n\"The sea was very rough, and everybody got seasick and we were soaking wet, cold and miserable. It was June, but it felt like November, December. We were under fire all the way. When we got 200,300 yards from shore, we started taking artillery and mortars, and then as we got closer in the small arms opened up. And they cut us down pretty good. Some of the men couldn't swim, and we were carrying 60 pounds of equipment or weapons. It was a tough deal,\" said Staff Sergeant John Robert Slaughter, Company D, 116th Infantry, 29th Division, according to a journal called American History.\n\nAnother attacking infantryman form the Army\u2019s 1st Division recalled diving in the ocean to save a friend after their craft hit a German mine.\n\n\"Our landing craft hit a submerged mine 200,300 yards from shore and sunk. One of my buddies went overboard and I let my rifle down to help ease him up. He weighed 200 pounds; I weighed 125 pounds. He won. He was in the water with two guns, so when we abandoned the ship, so to speak, I had two Bangalore torpedoes. We swam ashore. At this point in time it was just breaking daylight. All the time there's people pushing right behind you. There are thousands coming on. Probably the only reason I survived the assault on the beach was the Germans could fire into a massive crowd behind me and they weren't worried about the first person up ahead,\" said Sergeant Claud C.

The bomber approached a crowd demonstrating against the Taliban and detonated the device at a nearby checkpoint.\n\nThe protesters were minority Shiites calling for a stop to the Taliban attacks in the province of Ghazni.\n\nThe province of Ghazni, which is south of Kabul, has been hotly contested between government forces and the Taliban. Afghan security forces have suffered heavy losses there in recent days, as they continue to battle Taliban attempts to seize full control of the province.\n\nThe province is so volatile that last October\u2019s parliamentary elections had to be postponed by a year. Last August, Taliban fighters briefly took the city of Ghazni, before government forces pushed them back out. But the insurgents control many parts of the province.\n\nThe Taliban is currently trying to keep pressure on the Afghan government ahead of potential peace talks. Its influence in the country has been steadily growing in recent years, with fighting in around two-thirds of the country.\n\nAnd now Russia has stepped in as mediator. Russia said the U.S. has failed to broker peace in Afghanistan, which is why it is now focusing on peace efforts in the country.\n\nA delegation from the Taliban met with representatives from Afghan government in Moscow last Friday.\n\nIt described the meeting as a small step toward further talks. The Taliban has come to the negotiating table in the past, with earlier mediation efforts initiated by Qatar, but until now it has refused to talk directly to the government in Kabul.\n\nAn official from U.S. government attended Friday\u2019s meeting in Moscow as an observer. But the U.S. is also making diplomatic moves of its own, with the U.S. Envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalizad, in the region visiting Pakistan, Afghanistan and Qatar over the next week.\n\nThe U.S. military said it continues to support Afghan government forces in the fight against the Taliban in Ghazni with air support and intelligence gathering. The Taliban has been fighting to regain influence in Afghanistan since it was toppled from power in 2001.", "Stan Lee honored military service members on Veterans Day with social media posts highlighting his time in the Army during World War II a day before he died at age 95.\n\nThe Lee family attorney confirmed the legendary Marvel superheroes creator's death on Monday. He was pronounced dead at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nA day before his death, Lee celebrated Veterans Day by posting a throwback black-and-white photo on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter of himself during his time in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Sunday's posts were his final ones before his death.\n\n\u201cThank you to all of America's veterans for your service. Fun fact: Stan\u2019s official US Army title during WW2 was \u2018Playwright.\u2019 #VeteransDay,\u201d the post on Sunday read.\n\nLee enlisted in the Army in 1942 shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor and worked as a lineman before he transferred to technical writing and creating posters, the Department of Defense News reported. The military recognized his impeccable writing skills, which he later used to develop some of the most celebrated superhero characters.\n\nLee\u2019s time in the army ended in 1945.\n\nSTAN LEE, LEGENDARY MARVEL SUPERHEROES CREATOR, DEAD AT 95\n\nThe Marvel Comics icon was inducted into the Signal Corps Regimental Association in March 2017 \u2014 a moment he says trumps some of his top accomplishments.\n\n\u201cI want to tell [fans] if you\u2019re looking, this is one of my proudest moments. Excelsior!\u201d Lee said when he received a certificate of his lifetime membership and coin from the battalion. \"Signal Corps forever.\"\n\nLee previously said his comic book characters were influenced by some of his life experiences.\n\nAs the top writer at Marvel Comics and later as its publisher, Lee was widely considered the architect of the contemporary comic book. He revived the industry in the 1960s by offering the costumes and action craved by younger readers while insisting on sophisticated plots, college-level dialogue, satire, science fiction, even philosophy.\n\nSome of his most well-known characters include the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, Spider-Man, Iron Man, which all have been brought to life in films.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "Florida Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott insisted Monday he \"won the election\" while accusing incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of trying to \"steal\" the race from him, amid chaotic recounts in the sunshine state's Senate and gubernatorial races.\n\nOver the weekend, Florida's secretary of state Ken Detzner announced there would be recounts in both the Senate race and the governor's race, noting that unofficial results in both races fell within the margin that by law triggers a recount. But Scott said he's confident his victory won't be overturned.\n\nFox News Radio National Correspondent Eben Brown joined Fox News Radio's Marie Harf with the latest on Florida's recount.\n\nOn what is happening in Florida: The recount is in progress and it's in progress statewide. For the most part it's going swimmingly well. In fact, for the most part there were no problems in the state of Florida, save for Broward and Palm Beach counties, because other counties in the state, including Miami-Dade which is the state's most populated county, they didn't have problems on election night. They didn't have problems getting their mail in ballots counted and in fact they're well on their way to getting this recount done. I think even ahead of schedule, by that we mean before Thursday, which is a legal deadline for this machine led recount. Broward is having toward. They're saying they're not sure if they're going to make the deadline. They're actually not saying much, which is leading to other frustration and legal questions because they are supposed to be informing everyone what they are doing under the state sunshine law. Palm Beach County has come forward and said there's no way we're going to be done by Thursday and that leaves open another legal trap door.

Lee, said the creative dynamo who revolutionized the comic world by introducing human frailties in superheroes such as Spider-Man, The Fantastic Four and The Incredible Hulk, was declared dead Monday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Shane Duffy, CEO of Stan Lee\u2019s POW! Entertainment, said: \"We at Stan Lee\u2019s Lee POW! Entertainment are saddened by the loss of our friend and mentor Stan Lee, the father of pop culture. His passing today marks a devastating and painful moment in time, but the legacy of Stan Lee, through his creative genius and his universes of characters, will continue to reach the world of true believers for generations to come.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and the fans of not only his work, but of him, as a friend who made the world a better place,\" the statement continued. \"He was a true iconic pioneer with no comparable second. It has been an honor to work beside him.\"\n\nLee had experienced several health issues throughout the past year including a battle with pneumonia as well as issues with his vision.\n\nAs the top writer at Marvel Comics and later as its publisher, he revived the industry in the 1960s by offering the costumes and action craved by younger readers while insisting on sophisticated plots, college-level dialogue, satire, science fiction, even philosophy.\n\nMarvel Chief Creator Office Joe Quesada shared his condolences on Twitter.\n\nThe official DC Comics Twitter account, known as the rival of Lee's Marvel Comics, posted its condolences to the late creator as well.\n\nMillions responded to the unlikely mix of realistic fantasy, and many of his characters, including Spider-Man, the Hulk and X-Men went on to become stars of blockbuster films. Recent projects he helped make possible range from the films \"Black Panther\" and \"Doctor Strange\" to such TV series as \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" and \"Guardians of the Galaxy.\"\n\n\"I think everybody loves things that are bigger than life. ... I think of them as fairy tales for grown-ups,\" he told The Associated Press in a 2006 interview. \"We all grew up with giants and ogres and witches. Well, you get a little bit older and you're too old to read fairy tales. But I don't think you ever outgrow your love for those kind of things, things that are bigger than life and magical and very imaginative.\"\n\nLee considered the comic-book medium an art form and he was prolific: By some accounts, he came up with a new comic book every day for 10 years.\n\n\"I wrote so many I don't even know. I wrote either hundreds or thousands of them,\" he told the AP in 2006.\n\nHe hit his stride in the 1960s when he brought the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, Spider-Man, Iron Man and numerous others to life.\n\n\"It was like there was something in the air. I couldn't do anything wrong,\" he recalled.\n\nHis heroes, meanwhile, were a far cry from virtuous do-gooders such as DC Comics' Superman.\n\nThe Fantastic Four fought with each other. Spider-Man was goaded into superhero work by his alter ego, Peter Parker, who suffered from unrequited crushes, money problems and dandruff. The Silver Surfer, an alien doomed to wander Earth's atmosphere, waxed about the woeful nature of man. The Hulk was marked by self-loathing. Daredevil was blind and Iron Man had a weak heart.\n\n\"The beauty of Stan Lee's characters is that they were characters first and superheroes next,\" Jeff Kline, executive producer of the \"Men in Black\" animated television series, told The Blade of Toledo, Ohio, in 1998.\n\nSome of Lee's creations became symbols of social change \u2014 the inner turmoil of Spider-Man represented '60s America, for example, while The Black Panther and The Savage She-Hulk mirrored the travails of minorities and women.\n\nLee scripted most of Marvel's superhero comics himself during the '60s, including the Avengers and the X-Men, two of the most enduring. In 1972, he became Marvel's publisher and editorial director; four years later, 72 million copies of Spider-Man were sold.\n\n\"He's become our Mickey Mouse,\" he once said of the masked, web-crawling crusader.\n\nLee also published several books, including \"The Superhero Women\" in 1977 and \"How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way\" the following year, when he was named publisher of the year by the Periodical and Book Association of America.\n\nCBS turned the Hulk into a successful TV series, with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno portraying the doomed scientist from 1978-82. A Spider-Man series ran briefly in 1978. Both characters were featured in animated TV series as well.\n\nJ.C. Lee, his daughter, told TMZ, \"My father loved all of his fans. He was the greatest, most decent man.\"\n\nJ.C., 67, and Lee's relationship was strained earlier this year when he addressed allegations of elder abuse against his daughter. She was named in a declaration signed by Lee alleging that she was being manipulated by people out for his money. He also claimed a former publicist, Jerry Olivarez, stole $1.4 million from him. Lee also had a judge extend a restraining order against Keya Morgan, his former business manager. He alleged at the time that J.C. was working with them against his best interests.\n\nThe comic book giant eventually sided with his daughter.\n\n\u201cShe is a wonderful daughter. I like her. We have occasional spats. But I have occasional spats with everyone. I\u2019ll probably have one with you, where I\u2019ll be saying, \u2018I didn\u2019t say that!\u2019 But, that\u2019s life,\u201d he told The Daily Beast in an October interview.\n\nThe first big-budget movie based on Lee's characters, \"X-Men,\" was a smash in 2000, earning more than $130 million at North American theaters. \"Spider-Man\" did even better, taking in more than $400 million in 2002.\n\nThe same year he saw \"X-Men\" rise to new heights for the superhero genre, he partnered with POW! Entertainment.\n\nUnfortunately, Lee\u2019s relationship with POW! grew somewhat contentious in 2018. He filed a $1 billion lawsuit against the company for allegedly fraudulent use of his likeness. However, he later dropped the suit and told The Hollywood Reporter that he wanted to put it behind him to continue doing creative work.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing has been confusing to everyone, including myself and the fans, but I am now happy to be surrounded by those who want the best for me,\" Lee said in a July statement to THR. \"I am thrilled to put the lawsuit behind me, get back to business with my friends and colleagues at POW! and launch the next wave of amazing characters and stories!\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s death falls on Veterans Day, which is fitting as he served in World War II with the U.S. Army Signal Corps from 1942 to 1945. Lee reportedly enlisted in the military shortly after hearing about the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nIn his final post to social media, he wished fans a happy Veterans Day while sharing an image of himself from his army days.\n\nIn 2017, Lee\u2019s wife of almost 70 years, Joan, died at age 93.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "The devastation is complete in Paradise, California, where a wildfire tore through town and destroyed everything, killing at least 29 and destroying so many houses it's already the most destructive fire on record in the state.\n\nIn other places in the state, fires were more selective, leaving some houses leveled and others still standing. Two people were also found dead in a wildfire in Southern California, where flames tore through Malibu mansions and working-class Los Angeles suburbs alike.\n\nMore than 8,000 firefighters in all battled three large wildfires burning across nearly 400 square miles (1,040 square kilometers) in Northern and Southern California, with out-of-state crews continuing to arrive and gusty, blowtorch winds starting up again.\n\nFox News Chief Correspondent In Los Angeles Jonathan Hunt joined Fox News Radio's Marie Harf with the latest on the wildfires in California.\n\nOn the northern fire in California: Let's start up north first that's the campfire, as it's been called. It's outside of Chico, so north of Sacramento if you want to picture it on a map. That has already become the deadliest fire in California's history, at least 29 people confirmed dead there. There are another 230 or so people who are unaccounted for at the moment by the sheriff's reckoning. The fear there obviously is that the death toll is going to rise quite considerably. The town of Paradise has basically been wiped out completely by this fire. We've seen some quite extraordinary scenes and the first in that case moved so quickly that people just did have time to get anything together. (1:15)\n\nOn Woosley fire: The Woosley fire has scorched dozens of square miles it started sort of north and west of L.A. around the towns of Thousands Oaks and Newbury Park, but then it came over the hills there over the mountains, and rushed down towards the seaside city that everybody knows, Malibu. It's home to a lot of celebrities and home to a lot of multi-million dollar mansions, but I can tell you there are also a lot of perfectly ordinary middle-class Americans who also live there. (3:48)\n\nOn if this is the new normal: We all have to accept that it is the new normal or as Governor Jerry Brown put it today, 'the new abnormal.' It's not necessary the frequency of the fires or the number of the fires, but from my experience...the intensity of the fires seems to be greater. (5:45)\n\nOn how long it might take to get these fires under control: A lot depends on the winds tonight, which they say are going to pick up, these Santa Ana, very dry powerful winds. If they pick up new fires then we could be into a whole new fight over the next 24 to 36 hours. The containment figures on both the campfire and Woosley fire still very low at the moment. They've been helped by the weather today, but as they say the forecast isn't good.

The U.S. Navy attributed the dramatic event to magnetic perturbations of solar storms.\"\n\nNASA SHOWS INCREDIBLE IMAGE OF THE SUN 'EXPLODING'\n\nIt continues: \"In researching these events we determined that the widespread electric\u2010 and communication\u2010grid disturbances that plagued North America and the disturbances in southeast Asia late on 4 August likely resulted from propagation of major eruptive activity from the Sun to the Earth.\"\n\nNews of the study was first reported by LiveScience.\n\nThe solar flares caused significant disruptions to Earth's communications equipment, with X-ray emissions remaining high for more than 16 hours, the researchers wrote.\n\nThey also noted that a defense communications satellite \"suffered a mission-ending on orbit power failure;\" and Air Force sensors turned on, giving a false reading that a nuclear weapon had detonated on Earth.\n\nNASA describes the 1972 event as \"legendary\" because it happened between two Apollo missions: \"the crew of Apollo 16 had returned to Earth in April and the crew of Apollo 17 was preparing for a moon landing in December,\" NASA writes on its website. Former radiation health officer Francis Cucinotta estimates that had astronauts been in space, they could have absorbed 400 rem from the solar flare. Perhaps not enough to cause death, although they would have needed \"a quick trip back to Earth for medical care\" to save their lives.\n\nAccording to LiveScience, pilots flying near that part of Vietnam noticed approximately two dozen explosions in just a 30-second period. Eventually, the U.S. Navy investigated the situation and determined the solar storm caused the magnetic sensors in the mines to trip as if ships were passing them, causing them to detonate.\n\nThe events were felt all over the Earth. A 3,080 kilometer/second shock was felt near the Guam observatory. Magnetometer traces went \"off scale\" in Boulder, CO and a \"bright aurora appeared in the northern United States,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nNASA'S PARKER SOLAR PROBE HAS 'SUCCEEDED' AFTER IT WHIZZED PAST THE SUN FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\nEffects were also felt in Honolulu, HI, along the southern coast of the U.K. and \"within 2 hours, \"commercial airline pilots reported aurora as far south as Bilbao, Spain.\"\n\nUltimately, the solar event caused the U.S. Navy to look for alternatives to magnetic sensor mines that would be not be affected by solar events, such as this.\n\nFollow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter @Chris_Ciaccia", "Like many wildfire evacuees, celebrities are returning to their California homes only to find smoke, ash and piles of charred debris.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire is one of three major wildfires ravaging the state.

While other officials implicated in the plot have fled the country, the former intelligence chief is now residing in northern Ethiopia and should turn himself in to authorities, he said.\n\nYilikal Getnet, an opposition figure, told The Associated Press the public had demanded the arrests of the former officials.\n\n\"These have been issues that we in the opposition have long been calling for, too,\" he said, adding that Ethiopia needs a truth and reconciliation process to investigate past misdoings. \"The ruling party alone can't bring justice for all these atrocities committed in the past.\"\n\nUnder the previous government, Ethiopia, a close security ally of the West, used to be accused of rights violations by human rights activists. Since Abiy, 42, came to power in April his new government has released several thousand political prisoners, permitted exiled opposition groups to return home, dropped terror charges against prominent opposition politicians and permitted the media to operate more freely.\n\nDespite the reforms, ethnic-based clashes are continuing in some parts of Ethiopia and pose the most serious threat to Abiy's leadership of this East African nation of 100 million people.\n\nAmnesty International welcomed the arrests.\n\n\"These arrests are an important first step toward ensuring full accountability for the abuses that have dogged the country for several decades,\" said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International's East Africa Director. \"Many of these officials were at the helm of government agencies infamous for perpetrating gross human rights violations, such as torture and the arbitrary detention of people including in secret facilities.

There was no immediate comment from the Pakistani government.\n\nKhalilzad is on his second regional tour since being appointed, with stops in Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates as well as Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office. The insurgents say they met Khalilzad in Qatar last month. Khalilzad arrived in the region last Thursday and will return to Washington on Nov. 20.\n\nWhen Khalilzad was last in the region Pakistan released another Taliban leader, Abdul Ghani Baradar, one of the founders of the radical religious movement. Baradar was arrested in 2010 in a joint U.S. and Pakistani operation. At the time, it was reported Baradar was taken into custody by Pakistan after he tried to open independent peace talks with Afghanistan's then-president, Hamid Karzai.\n\nIn a recent interview, Karzai told The Associated Press he had repeatedly tried to secure Baradar's release but he was thwarted by both Pakistan and the U.S., who wanted him detained because of his stature within the Taliban.\n\nBaradar's release has been a long-standing demand of the Taliban.\n\nEfforts to find a peaceful end to Afghanistan's protracted war have accelerated in recent months, as a troop surge announced by President Donald Trump last August has done little to change conditions on the ground. In recent months the Taliban have carried out near-daily attacks on Afghan security forces as well as coordinated assaults on major cities.\n\nThe Taliban have long demanded direct talks with the United States, referring to the Kabul government as puppets. Washington has neither confirmed nor denied a meeting between Khalilzad and the Taliban took place last month.\n\nTaliban officials present at the meeting characterized those talks as productive. They said they pressed to have their office in Qatar recognized and agreed to meet again, although no date was set.\n\nAfghanistan's fractious government, which is jointly headed by President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, has been prickly about direct talks between Washington and the Taliban.\n\nIn addition to the three Taliban figures recently freed by Pakistan, five senior members of the Taliban who were freed from the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay in 2014 in exchange for captured U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl have joined the insurgent group's political office in Qatar.\n\nThe induction of the five has significantly strengthened the ability of the Taliban's Qatar office to sell a peace deal to insurgents on the battlefield.\n\nSani's release further reconstitutes the Taliban leadership. Sani was placed on the U.S. terrorist list in January, accused of supplying the Taliban with weapons as well as being a major financier travelling to the Gulf to obtain both money and supplies for the insurgent movement.", "Hamas said it launched several rockets toward southern Israel on Monday in retaliation for an Israeli military operation the day before in Gaza, igniting a new round of fighting near the Gaza Strip in what appeared to be the most intense exchange of fire since a 2014 war.\n\nPalestinian officials said at least three people, including two militants, were killed by Israeli fire and nine were wounded, and an Israeli airstrike destroyed the ruling Hamas group's TV station. In Israel, the national rescue service said at least seven people were wounded, including a 19-year-old soldier who was in critical condition.\n\nAround sundown on Monday, militants launched some 100 rockets in less than an hour, the most intense barrage since the 50-day war four years ago. The outgoing rockets, which continued into the evening, lit up the skies of Gaza and set off air raid sirens throughout southern Israel.\n\nThe military said warplanes, helicopters, and tanks had struck over 30 militant targets, including military compounds, observation posts, and weapons facilities. It also said it targeted a squad that was launching rockets.\n\nLate Monday, an airstrike destroyed the Gaza City headquarters of Hamas' Al Aqsa TV station. Israel had fired warning shots ahead of the airstrike, prompting the station to halt programming and replace it with a logo. Minutes later, the airstrike flattened the three-story building and the station went black.\n\nWorkers had evacuated the building after the warning shots, and there were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nHamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum condemned the bombing as \"a barbaric, brazen aggression.\" Ten minutes later, the station resumed broadcasts, airing prerecorded national songs.\n\nIsrael said the station \"broadcasts violent propaganda\" and provides \"operational messaging\" to militants.\n\nHamas and the smaller militant group Islamic Jihad said the rocket fire was revenge for Sunday night's Israeli incursion. Islamic Jihad spokesman Daoud Shehab said the groups wanted \"the occupation and its supporters know that the lives of our sons come with a price.\"\n\nIn all, some 300 rockets were fired into Israel by mid-evening, the army said. The Israeli military said it intercepted 70 rockets, and most of the others fell in open spaces. But rockets landed in the southern Israeli town of Sderot, setting off a large fire near a shopping center. Another rocket landed near a factory, and several homes were hit in southern towns.\n\nA senior Hamas militant and an Israeli soldier were among those killed in the operation Sunday. The terror group\u2019s armed wing, the \"Qassam Brigades,\u201d claimed Israeli undercover forces in a civilian vehicle infiltrated two miles into Gaza and fatally shot one of its commanders, later identified as Nour el-Deen Baraka.\n\nHamas said militants discovered the car and chased it down, prompting Israeli airstrikes that killed \"a number of people.\" The Palestinian Health Ministry said six people, including at least five militants, were killed and seven others wounded. In Israel, the military said it had intercepted two rockets fired from Gaza as air raid sirens continued to sound.\n\nIsraeli media reported that Baraka was closely involved in Hamas' tunnel program, which the group uses to smuggle arms and supplies out of the Gaza Strip as well as conduct attacks inside the Jewish state. An Israeli Defense Forces spokesperson said the aim of the mission did not involve killing anyone.\n\n\"The special operation yesterday was not intended to kill or abduct terrorists, but to strengthen Israeli security,\" the @IDFspokesperson verified account tweeted. \"The force waged a heroic and very complex battle and was able to exfiltrate in its entirety.

In return, Israel wants quiet and an end to the border protests.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters Sunday that the money was \u201cthe right step\u201d at the moment, and that he was committed to restoring quiet along the Israel-Gaza frontier and preventing a humanitarian crisis in the coastal Palestinian territory.\n\nLater, at a press conference in Paris, when asked about his longer-term vision for Gaza, Netanyahu said there could be no political resolution as long as Hamas is in power.\n\nFox News\u2019 Frank Miles and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "Two men from unique backgrounds are forging ahead, in a battle against each other and nature, to be the first to journey across Antarctica unsupported.\n\nAmerican adventure-athlete Colin Brady, 33, and British Army Captain Louis Rudd, 49, embarked on the perilous, 921-mile trek on Oct. 31 \u2014 both carrying sleeping bags, freeze-dried food, cross-country skis, hand-held satellite phones and modems, a GPS tracker and portable solar panels.\n\nIn order for the journey to be considered unsupported, the competitors cannot accept any help from the few people they might encounter, not even a cup of hot tea.

However, some gamers appeared to have turned it around on the partners and have been using the new skins to court controversy.\n\nSome players decided to use the skins to make their avatars look like a few controversial NFL figures, according to Yahoo Sports.\n\nA few gamers who created the avatar of Colin Kaepernick took a picture of it taking a knee in the game. The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback sparked controversy in 2016 when he kneeled during the national anthem to protest perceived racial and social injustice in the U.S.\n\nAnother player created Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end who was found guilty of murder before committing suicide in prison.\n\nA Jason Pierre-Paul character was also created in the game. The character was featured with a bag of fireworks wrapped around his back. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive lineman is infamously known for blowing off some of his fingers during a July 4, 2015 fireworks incident when he was playing for the New York Giants.\n\nAmong the aforementioned three avatars, someone created an O.J.

A Twitter account named @The_Speck24 appeared to make the Simpson player and wrote in a tweet, \u201cOJ Simpson skin so I can murder these opponents and try to get away with the W!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Epic Games would create a system to limit players from creating certain avatars.\n\nA request for comment from Epic Games wasn\u2019t immediately returned to Fox News.", "He's been called everything from the Usama bin Laden of the drug cartel world to the most \"ruthless, dangerous, and feared man on the planet.\"\n\nBut starting Tuesday, 61-year-old Joaqu\u00edn Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n Loera \u2013 better known as \"El Chapo,\" or \"shorty\" in Spanish slang \u2013 will finally face a court of law, accused of running the infamous Sinaloa drug cartel, generally regarded as the world's largest.\n\nU.S. law enforcement sources connected to Guzm\u00e1n told Fox News the accused drug lord is generally very quiet and well-behaved in custody, and keeps almost entirely to himself behind bars. But officials also say he's not talking, and has refused to cooperate with any type of intelligence sharing or plea agreement \u2013 even with the caveat of long-term protection for his 29-year-old beauty queen wife, and twin seven-year-old daughters.\n\nGuzman's lawyer Eduardo Balarezo confirmed to Fox News there \"have been no plea negotiations, no plea offers - and there will be no plea.\" He added that since his arrest, Guzm\u00e1n has firmly insisted he wants his \"day in court.\"\n\nBalazero didn't reveal his defense strategy for the trial. But he has in the past contended potential prosecution witnesses should not be trusted. He has also suggested Guzman was merely a \"middle manager\" in massive cartel he's accused of ruthlessly running.\n\nSome government officials connected to the case contend Guzm\u00e1n is arrogant enough to think the legal system can be manipulated here, in the same way he was able to manipulate corrupt tiers of the Mexican government.\n\n\"When he first arrived in the United States, he was shell-shocked it had finally happened,\" said one U.S.-based law enforcement source. \"But now, he is a lot more comfortable, knows how to play the game.\"\n\nThe trial is expected to cost upwards of $50 million, and one U.S. official well-versed in the case told Fox News it will likely go longer than the already anticipated four months, given the encroachment of the holiday season and the litany of breaks in the court schedule.\n\nThat opinion is shared by Andrew Lewis, president of a private intelligence firm, the Ulysses Group, and former deputy director of the counter narco-terrorism task force in the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\n\"I would be surprised if it wrapped up in four months. The government's case undoubtedly utilizes sensitive information and intelligence which requires parallel construction for the prosecution, so that they don't have to expose our intel operations and capabilities with respect to Mexico and the cartels,\" he said. \"The danger here is that the defense is entitled to all the prosecution's evidence, barring some exception. The defense will want to gain access to the government's sources and methods used against El Chapo and the cartel. \"\n\nThat could not only help the defense's case, but damage ongoing efforts against the cartels, and lead to the targeted killing of those who helped the government.\n\nStringent security measures have been implemented in preparation for the much-anticipated trial. Given the breadth of Guzm\u00e1n's reach, and his alleged past use of hitmen, prosecutors have successfully pushed for an anonymous jury. Their identities will remain concealed behind a thick cloak of secrecy, as approved by U.S. District Court Judge Brian Cogan, the judge who will hear the case.\n\nHeavy security and high-tech scanners have been installed at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn where the trial is being held. Guzm\u00e1n himself will be held in the bowels of the courthouse in a specially designed cell, which will comes as relief to the thousands of New Yorkers who will no longer have to deal with the bridge and roadway closures that take place every time he is transported from his current downtown Manhattan holding facility. Bomb-sniffing dogs will also patrol the area outside the courthouse, and entire block closures will still be instituted during some days.\n\nThe identities of at least 16 cooperating government witnesses will also remain secret. Several of the witnesses are believed to be high-ranking cartel members who are already behind bars, while their families are in witness protection programs. In July, a former Guzm\u00e1n right-hand man, Damaso Lopez, was flown to the U.S. from a Mexican prison, where he is now being regarded as a key witness.\n\nThe jury will ultimately determine whether Guzm\u00e1n is guilty of 11 trafficking, money laundering and firearms charges. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. He faces life behind bars, but not the death penalty, due to an extradition deal with Mexico.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n has been accused of running his operation from behind bars, and has twice managed to escape Mexican prison \u2013 once with the assistance of heavy cash payments and expert underground tunnel work. In the dead of the night on Thursday, January 19, 2017, Guzm\u00e1n was extradited to New York.\n\nThe treaty agreement, according to one U.S. government source, required delicate wording in which the Mexican government was able to seek a certain level of guarantee that it would not be embarrassed or negatively implicated by the release of evidence.\n\nDavid Gaddis, CEO of international protection firm G-Global Protection Solutions and a former chief of enforcement operations at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), explained extradition is a \"very delicate\" process. Because Mexico does not allow extradition for a suspect who might face the death penalty in another country, the U.S. in 2016 quietly dropped murder charges from the indictment.\n\nThe U.S. is still seeking the forfeiture of \"more than $14 billion in cash proceeds from narcotics sales\" from Guzm\u00e1n. While some sources said it would be impossible to recover that much money, sources have told Fox News his worth is likely much higher.\n\nMeanwhile, Guzm\u00e1n has complained about the conditions in which he is being held, and has become an unlikely advocate for prison reform. He is under heavy guard in what is called 10 South, the most iron-clad security area in New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center. The cells are small, and the lights are bright, and Guzm\u00e1n is alone for 23 hours \u2013 afforded an hour a day to watch television or exercise.\n\nIn a series of court filings, Guzm\u00e1n's legal counsel have bemoaned the conditions of his confinement, arguing they violate his rights and contribute to his ailing health.\n\nGiven all that's known about him, what else may unfold about El Chapo that hasn't already been documented in scores of books, Hollywood depictions, and hundreds of articles?\n\n\"We will gain insight into the cartel's network \u2013 production and distribution arms, but most importantly the money laundering side of the cartel where legitimate and illegitimate businesses, attorneys, accountants, and officials functioned to wash and move money for the cartel,\" said Lewis. \"Years ago, OFAC (the Office of Foreign Assets Control) identified approximately 300 companies associated with El Chapo and his money laundering activities, and there are many more than this. And we will get some insight into the security apparatus of the cartel - technology used, tactics, corrupt officials, violent activities, etc.\"\n\nBURMA DOUBLES DOWN ON CLAIMS TO JUSTIFY TREATMENT OF ROHINGYA MINORITY\n\nQUESTIONS ARISE OVER POLITICS, MOTIVATION OF CARAVAN ORGANIZERS\n\nThen there is the personal side of the trial. Guzm\u00e1n is reported to have fathered 13 children, and has apparently married at least three times. His California-born Mexican beauty queen, Emma Coronel Aispuro, is 32 years his junior.\n\nOne Mexican law enforcement source called Coronel \"very loved\" by Sinaloa cartel members. And given she is \"on a few hit lists\" from rival cartels, is \"very well protected.\"\n\n\"There is a running joke among them that they don't need to waste resources keeping surveillance on her though,\" said the source. \"But the U.S. government is doing it for them, making sure she stays alive.\"\n\nIndeed, one US intelligence source said Coronel's movements are well-known. She has traveled from California to several court dates in New York, and may remain for the trial.\n\nThe Sinaloa Cartel has long funneled tons of cocaine into the U.S., and on to its various distribution cells. It also traffics in marijuana, MDMA, methamphetamine, and heroin. Guzm\u00e1n's indictment claimed that under his leadership between 1989 and 2014, the organization became the \"largest drug trafficking organization in the world.\"\n\nThe cartel's success made it popular with some in Mexico.\n\n\"El Chapo's initial popular support came from his ability to engage and relate to citizens in need. He did not initially intimidate, threaten, or bully, but instead displayed as a benefactor,\" said J.T Patten, a former government intelligence operative. \"Mexico, known for its corruption and poverty where politicians have failed, had a void in connecting to the people. Men like El Chapo exploited that fissure for a foothold of popular support giving the people work, money, and protection. A Robin Hood type.\"\n\nBut one U.S. government official noted the level of killing attributed to his cartel in recent years is beyond sickening. \"Day after day pictures of people decapitated, tortured, their hands and feet cut off. Women too, it doesn't matter,\" said the insider. \"There is no care for human life. This killing is cold-blooded.\"\n\nBut without their infamous leader, how strong is the notorious Sinaloa cartel?\n\nOne Mexican law enforcement official, who requested anonymity, said that \"fragmentations\" in Sinaloa have become evident since Guzm\u00e1n's absence and that other cartels have been encroaching on what was once absolutely undisputed turf.\n\nThe source also emphasized that while two of Guzm\u00e1n's sons are said to have inherited the top positions in Sinaloa, it is really a veteran drug lord, 70-year-old Ismael Zambada Garcia, better known as \"El Mayo,\" who has taken over.", "Romania's president said Monday his country isn't ready to take over the European Union's rotating presidency on Jan. 1 and called for the government to step down.\n\nPresident Klaus Iohannis said \"things have gone off the rails,\" and that there was \"a political necessity to replace the government,\" which he called \"an accident of Romanian democracy.\"\n\nViorica Dancila, a little-known politician became premier in January, but has little executive power as Liviu Dragnea, chairman of the ruling Social Democratic Party, basically runs the government. Dragnea can't be prime minister because of a conviction for vote-rigging.\n\n\"It's the 12th hour (and) we are totally unprepared,\" Iohannis said. \"There's no chance of a good government ... or proper involvement in European affairs.\"\n\nEuropean Affairs Minister Victor Negrescu, tasked with preparing Romania to take over the EU presidency, unexpectedly resigned last week. Romania government officials were apparently dissatisfied with Negrescu's performance in building good relations within the EU's executive branch.\n\n\"It's unclear at the government who the responsible people are, \"Iohannis said. \"People who should be dealing with the EU presidency resign or they're dismissed.\" Dragnea called the president's comments \"a major disservice to Romania.\"\n\nRomania is already facing censure from the EU over a contentious judicial overhaul last year that the bloc says undermines the fight against corruption.\n\nLast month, EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova voiced concern about Romania potentially struggling to manage the presidency while it was weighed down by domestic concerns, in particular corruption.\n\nThe EU on Tuesday will present its latest report on the judicial systems of Romania and Bulgaria. The bloc monitors the countries, amid concerns about corruption, their justice systems and organized crime.\n\n___\n\nLorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report.", "Florida Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott insisted Monday he \u201cwon the election\u201d while accusing incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of trying to \u201csteal\u201d the race from him, amid chaotic recounts in the sunshine state\u2019s Senate and gubernatorial races.\n\nOver the weekend, Florida\u2019s secretary of state Ken Detzner announced there would be recounts in both the Senate race and the governor\u2019s race, noting that unofficial results in both races fell within the margin that by law triggers a recount. But Scott said he's confident his victory won't be overturned.\n\n\u201cI won the election,\u201d Scott told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d Monday. \u201cI\u2019m going to focus on getting to Washington and getting my agenda implemented.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Scott was projected the winner of the Senate race, but Nelson has refused to concede amid the recounts.\n\nScott, who is Florida\u2019s outgoing Republican governor, filed two bombshell lawsuits against election officials in two Democratic strongholds in Florida\u2014Broward County and Palm Beach County\u2014flagging them for engaging in potentially \u201crampant fraud.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe won.

He can\u2019t stand the fact that he\u2019s not going to be elected for, what, the first time in decades. He\u2019s just here to steal the election.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Nelson's election lawyer, Marc Elias, said Monday that they would bring a new lawsuit this week to protect ballots that are denied due to \"mail/post office delays.\"\n\nIn the Florida governor\u2019s race, Republican candidate Ron DeSantis was announced the winner by the end of Election Day, with his Democratic opponent Andrew Gillum conceding on the night of the election. But by the end of last week, Gillum took back his concession and embraced a recount.\n\n\u201cI am replacing my words of concessions with an uncompromising and unapologetic call that we count every single vote,\u201d Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, told reporters Saturday, though saying he is prepared to accept \u201cwhatever the outcome of this election so far as every single vote\u2026is counted.\u201d\n\nBoth Scott and DeSantis led their races after the midterms on Tuesday, but as the days went on, and more votes were counted, those leads had all but disappeared. Scott\u2019s lead by Saturday afternoon was reduced to 0.15 percent and DeSantis\u2019 was 0.41 percent.\n\nThe shrinking leads quickly led to suspicions from Republicans that political shenanigans were taking place in Democratic counties that had yet to complete their vote counts. Democrats, meanwhile, have accused Republicans of trying to stop all votes from being counted.\n\nPresident Trump on Monday referred to Florida\u2019s election as being \u201cmassively infected.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged.

She added that Florida\u2019s secretary of state has no authority to grant extensions.\n\n\u201cSupervisors of Elections are independent officials and they are responsible for deciding when to upgrade or modernize their equipment,\u201d Revell said.\n\nBut Florida is not the only state hanging in limbo from last week. In Georgia\u2019s gubernatorial race, Republican Brian Kemp declared victory, though his Democratic opponent Stacey Abrams refused to concede and filed a federal lawsuit in an effort to force a runoff election.\n\nThe Abrams campaign\u2019s lawsuit asked a judge to delay vote certifications in Georgia\u2019s unsettled governor\u2019s race by one day, and block counties from tossing some provisional and absentee ballots that may have minor mistakes on them.\n\nKemp has said that it is \u201cmathematically impossible\u201d for the Abrams campaign to force a runoff. According to the latest tallies, Kemp is up by 59,000 votes. Kemp had 50.2 percent of the vote by early Monday.\n\nAbrams, though, has maintained that she will not concede until every vote has been counted, and pointed to the 5,000 new votes tallied over the weekend that favored her. The Washington Post reported that she would need 21,700 additional votes to force a runoff.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is this race is not over,\u201d Abrams\u2019 campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo said in a statement. \u201cIt is still too close to call, and we do not have confidence in the secretary of state\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nABRAMS CAMPAIGN FILES FEDERAL LAWSUIT IN HOPES TO FORCE RUNOFF\n\nKemp was Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, but resigned from the post last week upon declaring his victory in the gubernatorial race.\n\nAnd in Arizona, the race to replace Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., has yet to be settled, as Democratic candidate Rep. Kyrsten Sinema increased her advantage over Republican candidate Rep. Martha McSally by more than 32,000 votes as of Sunday.\n\n\"Kyrsten has now expanded her overall lead to 32,640 or 1.52 percent, meaning McSally would have to win the remainder of Maricopa ballots by 22 percent to take the lead in this race,\" Sinema spokesman Andrew Piatt said in a statement. \"This is not plausible. Kyrsten will be declared the next U.S. Senator from Arizona.\"\n\nBut approximately 200,000 votes remain uncounted across the state, and Arizona election officials said they would not be finished tallying votes until Thursday. More than 2.3 million votes were cast in the historic election.\n\n\u201cThe votes are still being tallied, but the latest count shows my liberal opponent has gained a slight edge.

Otherwise, the ownership will be transferred to the local government.\n\nLast month, U.N. humanitarian aid official Jan Egeland said that Syria's government had withdrawn the law, saying he was told of the decision by Russia, a key ally of Assad that tipped the balance of power in his favor since joining the war three years ago.\n\nThe Syrian government passed Law 10 in April to create \"redevelopment zones\" to rebuild property damaged in seven years of civil war.\n\nPrior to the latest amendment, Human Rights Watch had said the government passed laws in order to seize private property, displace residents and discourage refugees from returning.\n\nThe new draft says property owners will have to put forward an application giving their residency address along with the documents proving ownership or a list of properties.\n\nSANA quoted Hussein Makhlouf, minister of local administration, as saying that the amendments give citizens enough time to put forward documents regarding their ownership.\n\nA third of Syria's housing has been destroyed in the last seven years, according to Human Rights Watch.

But we actually believe that's not true based on the data we obtained.\"\n\nIn an email to Fox News, Loeb said his and Bialy's paper \"attempts to explain the excess force\" that acted on Oumuamua when observed and Weryk's reaction \"shows prejudice.\"\n\n\"Our paper follows the standard scientific methodology: an anomaly is observed in data, the standard explanation fails to explain it and so an alternative interpretation is proposed,\" Loeb wrote in the email. \"I encourage anyone with a better explanation to write a paper about it and publish it. Any wrong interpretation can be ruled out when more data will be released on `Oumuamua or other members of its population in the future.

Nurul Huda said officials decided to shift the date to Dec. 30 in response to the proposals by the opposition parties. The new deadline for filing nominations is Nov. 28.\n\nThe ruling Awami League party, its allies and some opposition parties welcomed the decision, but a major opposition alliance was unhappy because it wanted the elections to be deferred by a month. The alliance, called the National Oikya Front, consists of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and other parties.\n\nThe initial date for the election was announced last Thursday.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina's five-year-term expires on Jan. 28.\n\nHuda said he was happy that all eligible political parties have agreed to join the elections. Initially it was unclear if Zia's party, which boycotted the last elections in 2014, would participate after she was jailed on corruption charges. But since it joined the new alliance, Zia's party has attempted to regain its position.\n\nOn Monday, five top opposition leaders met with Zia in a jail in Dhaka, and said she asked them to contest the polls.\n\n\"Madam offered prayers and expressed hope that we will move forward with our unity with the people,\" said Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, secretary-general of her party.\n\nHasina will head an election-time government as provided for in the constitution.

Rajapaksa, who was president from 2005 to 2015, is considered a hero by some in Sri Lanka's ethnic Sinhalese majority because he oversaw the end of a 25-year civil war by crushing ethnic minority Tamil rebels in 2009.\n\nBut his time in power was marred by allegations of war-time atrocities, corruption and nepotism.\n\n___\n\nBUILDING TENSIONS\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister.\n\nWickremesinghe's government came under fire last year after handing over operations of a port to a Chinese company in a 99-year lease that the previous government had built in Rajapaksa's home district with Chinese loans. Rajapaksa described the deal to his left-leaning supporters as a bid by Wickremesinghe to privatize national assets. Wickremesinghe said in an interview with The Associated Press that the deal helped the country avoid defaulting on debts accumulated during Rajapaksa's presidency.\n\nSirisena has accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge that Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied and that so far has not led to any arrests.\n\n___\n\nA POWER PLAY\n\nOn Oct. 26, the alliance between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe formally fell apart, with Sirisena naming Rajapaksa the new prime minister and suspending Parliament.\n\nAfter a week of upheaval, Sirisena announced he was dissolving Parliament and calling snap elections due on Jan. 5. He later explained in a nationally televised address that he dissolved Parliament out of fear that lawmakers would come to blows over his Oct. 26 decision.\n\n___\n\nREFUSING TO STAND DOWN\n\nWickremesinghe has been holed up in the prime minister's official residence in Colombo \u2014 surrounded by a skeleton security crew, supporters and Buddhist monks \u2014 since he was ousted and maintains he is the country's rightful leader. He has repeatedly called for Parliament to be reconvened so that he could prove his majority support among the country's 225 lawmakers.\n\nHe alleges that the snap election was called only when it became clear that Rajapaksa had failed to lure enough lawmakers to his side with offers of cash and jobs and would lose any confidence vote in Parliament.\n\n___\n\nA CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION\n\nThere is debate over whether Sirisena's Oct. 26 move was legal.\n\nHe has cited a general clause in Sri Lanka's Constitution stating that the president has the power to summon or suspend Parliament.\n\nSupreme Court petitioners challenging Sirisena's actions argue that a specific clause in the 19th amendment, added in 2015, stipulates that Parliament can't be dissolved until 4 1/2 years after its election, unless 2/3 of Parliament requests it happen sooner. The current Parliament was elected in August 2015.\n\n___\n\nWHO'S RUNNING SRI LANKA\n\nSirisena and Rajapaksa formed a Cabinet of party loyalists and government defectors within days of the Oct. 26 shakeup. They quickly cut fuel prices, a popular measure among those who blamed the Wickremesinghe-led government for Sri Lanka's sluggish economy.\n\n___\n\nTHE PUBLIC REACTS\n\nMembers of Wickremesinghe's political coalition, supporters and chanting Buddhist monks quickly set up camp in a hall at the prime minister's official residence after Sirisena withdrew most of Wickremesinghe's security personnel.\n\nFour days into the crisis, at least 10,000 people marched through central Colombo demanding that Sirisena summon Parliament.\n\nSirisena and Rajapaksa responded by organizing a massive rally on Nov. 5, with politicians from their party bringing busloads of constituents into Colombo. Police estimated at least 120,000 attended.\n\n___\n\nINTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION\n\nThe U.S. has said that Sirisena's decision to dissolve Parliament \"poses a vital threat to Sri Lanka's democratic institutions.\" Colombo-based diplomats from Australia, the U.K. and the European Union also issued statements calling for the country's constitution and democracy to be respected.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has offered to moderate discussions between Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe. On Sunday, he urged the government to respect \"democratic processes and institutions.\"\n\nChina and India have been careful not to take an overt position in Sri Lanka, which has been a battleground in their struggle for geopolitical supremacy in South Asia.\n\n___\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nPetitioners asked the Supreme Court on Monday to declare Sirisena's decrees null and void. That decision could come as early as Tuesday.\n\nBoth Rajapaksa and Sirisena have said they will face the Jan. 5 election together.\n\nSirisena suggested on Sunday that he could have Wickremesinghe forcibly removed from the prime minister's residence.", "Britain's top diplomat met Monday with King Salman in Saudi Arabia where he was expected to press the kingdom to fully cooperate with a Turkish investigation into last month's killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.\n\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is the first British minister to visit Saudi Arabia since Khashoggi was killed in the consulate in Turkey on Oct. 2 by what Ankara says was an assassination squad sent for the writer who was a critic of the crown prince.\n\nThe state-run Saudi News Agency said King Salman and Hunt discussed bilateral relations and the latest regional developments.

The head track coach, Cluke said, reversed Colell's decision to throw Long off the team and told her she didn't have that authority, while the now-retired principal brushed it aside as a one-time incident.\n\nLong rejoined the team after apologizing in front of several coaches and administrators.\n\nCluke said she, Colell and her father, also a track coach at the school at the time, repeatedly reported Long's behavioral problems, to no avail.\n\n\"You need to do something about this kid.

Attempts to get comment by phone and in person from officials at the school and its district were unsuccessful Friday, when both were closed because of a massive and deadly wildfire in the area.\n\nCluke recalled a time when she and her father sat down with Long for a talk and asked him why he wanted to join the military. His answer, she said, \"is burned in my soul.\"\n\n\"He said he wanted to be in the Marines because he wanted to go fight in the war for our country and he wanted to kill for our country,\" she said. \"When you hear somebody say they want to be in the military because they want to kill people in the name of our country, that's chilling.

That means he is playing a political game in this situation,\" Le Drian said.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu accused his French counterpart of \"impertinence\" and said Turkish officials had shared \"all information\" with France's intelligence on Oct. 24.\n\nGoing further, Cavusoglu suggested that Le Drian may be trying to cover-up the killing so as not to endanger agreements with Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"No one should be surprised if soon they begin to deny the murder that even Saudi Arabia accepted,\" Cavusoglu said. \"Who has recently reached which agreement \u2014 this should be carefully looked into.\"\n\nHe said: \"Are they trying to cover up this murder?

It is clearly unacceptable that the full circumstances behind his murder still remain unclear,\" Hunt said in a statement ahead of landing in Riyadh.\n\nA statement by the state-run Saudi News Agency did not make any references to Khashoggi, saying only that King Salman and Hunt discussed bilateral relations and the latest developments in the region.\n\nOn Sunday U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke with the Saudi crown prince on the telephone and \"emphasized that the United States will hold all of those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi accountable, and that Saudi Arabia must do the same.\"\n\nThe crown prince is widely suspected of at least having knowledge of the killing, which involved some members of his security entourage. Khashoggi was a Washington Post columnist and a critic of the crown prince who was living in self-imposed exile before his death, as Fox News previously reported.\n\nUnder mounting pressure, Saudi Arabia has changed its narrative about Khashoggi's killing, first saying that he walked out of the embassy the day he disappeared before eventually acknowledging Khashoggi died inside the consulate. Saudi Arabia has also recently acknowledged Turkish evidence that showed the slaying was premeditated.\n\nTurkey says a 15-member Saudi assassination squad strangled and dismembered Khashoggi at the consulate.

Khalifa Hifter, commander of the self-styled Libyan National Army, is unlikely to go to the Palermo event, according to officials close to him. The Egyptian- and UAE-backed Hifter, who also maintains close ties with France, views the meeting as lacking a \"clear agenda\" and designed largely as a media event favoring Italy, the host, according to the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.\n\nHifter's absence would render the meeting largely irrelevant.\n\nDealing a further blow to the meeting's chances of success, some European heads of state that Italy had hoped would come \u2014 including U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin \u2014 are also staying away, sending lower-ranking State Department or Foreign Ministry officials instead.\n\nFrance's foreign minister is expected, and Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte will be greeting arrivals Monday evening, ahead of the first event, a closed-door dinner.\n\nItaly has for years nervously eyed a lawless Libya across the Mediterranean.

It ... doesn't demand anything, doesn't set election dates, doesn't want to impose its businesses\" on Libya, Salvini said Sunday of the meeting, which runs through Tuesday.\n\nSalvini said Italy's approach is superior to that of France because it focuses on improving political and security conditions on the ground to ensure a future vote is democratic.\n\nFrance hosted a meeting on Libya in May, when rival Libyan leaders tentatively agreed on a roadmap for parliamentary and presidential elections but declined to sign a declaration outlining their commitments.\n\nItaly has traditionally had strong business ties in Libya, especially through its oil-and-gas giant ENI, as well as various engineering and construction companies.\n\nLibya plunged into chaos after the 2011 uprising that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, and is now governed by rival administrations in the east and west with both relying on the support of militias. It has also become a haven for Islamic militants and armed groups, including several from neighboring countries, which survive on looting and human trafficking, particularly in the south of the country.\n\nHifter has been instrumental in the fight against militants, going after them in their eastern hideouts and occasionally foraying into the vast and largely lawless south. However, a deadly overnight attack last month by militants from the extremist Islamic State group showed the limitations of his army, which he and his Egyptian backers will likely use to support their tireless calls to lift an international arms embargo on Libya.\n\nHifter is not the only person in Libya questioning Italy's motive behind organizing the conference.\n\n\"This is Italy's way of competing for a prime role in Libya's affairs, especially against France and other western powers,\" said Essam al-Jehani, a lawmaker from the parliament based in Tobruk, eastern Libya. \"This will lead to further meddling in our affairs, and we expect nothing positive from this meeting.\"\n\nGhassan Salame, the U.N. special envoy to Libya, told the U.N.

They've also filed a petition to repeal her Supreme Court acquittal. The government says Bibi remains in Pakistan, at a secret location for her own protection, until the review process is finished.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan has warned radical religious groups against using her plight to further their political aims with street protests.\n\nHe has defended the Supreme Court judges who on Oct. 21 acquitted the 54-year old mother of five of blasphemy charges but has also acquiesced to Islamists that the acquittal be reviewed in an appeal process.\n\nBlasphemy is a highly charged issue in Pakistan, where mere allegations or accusations that someone had insulted the Prophet Muhammad can incite mobs into a frenzy of violence. The charge also carries the death penalty and critics say the controversial blasphemy law is abused to settle religious scores.\n\nInformation Minister Fawad Chaudhry slammed the \"fake\" postings on Monday, one of which claims to show Bibi meeting Pope Francis. The photo is actually of Bibi's daughter from two years ago. Bibi and her family have always maintained her innocence and say she never insulted the prophet.\n\nChaudhry said the images misidentifying Bibi also prompted the death threats to a lawmaker in one photograph, Fazal Khan from the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Party. The lawmaker's constituency is in a deeply conservative region in the country's northwestern.\n\n\"People can even be killed because of such fake postings,\" Chaudhry said. The pictures were widely circulated on social media in Pakistan and shared on several local journalists' groups, even a police and a media group.\n\n\"We are trying to seek cooperation from Twitter and Facebook against such fake news,\" Chaudhry added.\n\nBibi's ordeal dates back to 2009 when she went to fetch water for herself and fellow farmworkers. An argument took place after two Muslim women refused to drink from the same container as Bibi, who is Roman Catholic. The women later said Bibi had insulted the Prophet Muhammad, and she was charged with blasphemy. She was put on trial, convicted and sentenced to death in 2010.\n\nFollowing Bibi's acquittal last month, the founder of the radical Tehreek-e-Labbak Party, Mohammed Afzal Qadri, issued a fatwa calling for the death of the three Supreme Court judges who handed down the acquittal and the overthrow of Khan's government. He also incited the military to mutiny.\n\nPakistan has seen lynching mobs over blasphemy allegations. In 2011, the governor of Punjab province was killed by his own guard after he defended Bibi and criticized the blasphemy law. A year later, Shahbaz Bhatti, the minister for minorities and a Christian, was shot and killed.\n\nBibi, who was freed from detention last week, is being held at a secret, closely guarded location in Pakistan. Those who are familiar with her circumstances say she is expected to stay at the location until the Supreme Court carries out the review.\n\nOn Sunday, the prime minister said the Supreme Court's decision would be final. For now, it's unclear when the review will be held or who would defend Bibi since her lawyer Saiful Malook fled the country following her acquittal, fearing for his life.", "A police officer mistakenly shot and killed a security guard at a bar in Chicago's south suburbs early Sunday morning, Chicago\u2019s Fox 32 reported.\n\nWitnesses said a security guard told a group of \"drunk men\" to leave a Robbins bar around 4 a.m. An armed suspect later came back inside the bar and opened fire, WGN-TV reported, citing witnesses.\n\nArmed security guards returned fire, the report said.

Rayburn was speaker, then Democrats lost control of the house in the 40's. Rayburn rallied when democrats picked up the house, lost it again, then Rayburn returned as speaker in the 1950's. The person sandwiched between Rayburn's stints as speaker is GOP speaker Joe Martin of Massachusetts, who served as speaker twice.\n\nWith the Speaker's Lobby, Chad Pergram.

Their instructor offers advice: Don't think of your target as a human being.\n\nSo when these boys and girls shoot, they will shoot to kill.\n\nMost are in their teens, but some are as young as 8 years old. They are at a summer camp created by one of Ukraine's radical nationalist groups, hidden in a forest in the west of the country, that was visited by The Associated Press. The camp has two purposes: to train children to defend their country from Russians and their sympathizers \u2014 and to spread nationalist ideology.\n\n\"We never aim guns at people,\" instructor Yuri \"Chornota\" Cherkashin tells them. \"But we don't count separatists, little green men, occupiers from Moscow, as people. So we can and should aim at them.\"\n\nThe nationalists have been accused of violence and racism, but they have played a central, volunteer role in Ukraine's conflict with Russia \u2014 and they have maintained links with the government. Earlier this year, the Ministry of Youth and Sports earmarked 4 million hryvnias (about $150,000) to fund some of the youth camps among the dozens built by the nationalists. The purpose, according to the ministry, is \"national patriotic education.\"\n\nMinistry spokeswoman Natalia Vernigora said the money is distributed by a panel which looks for \"signs of xenophobia and discrimination, it doesn't analyze activities of specific groups.\"\n\nCherkashin is a veteran of the fight against pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine; he was wounded in combat and later came to lead Sokil, or Falcon, the youth wing of the Svoboda party. It is important, he says, to inculcate the nation's youth with nationalist thought, so they can battle Vladimir Putin's Russia as well as \"challenges that could completely destroy\" European civilization.\n\nAmong those challenges: LGBT rights, which lecturers denounce as a sign of Western decadence.\n\n\"You need to be aware of all that,\" said instructor Ruslan Andreiko. \"All those gender things, all those perversions of modern Bolsheviks who have come to power in Europe and now try to make all those LGBT things like gay pride parades part of the education system.\"\n\nWhile some youths dozed off during lectures, others paid attention. Clearly, some were receptive.\n\nDuring a break in training, a teenager played a nationalist march on his guitar. It was decorated with a sticker showing white bombs hitting a mosque, under the motto, \"White Europe is Our Goal.\"\n\nAside from the lectures \u2014 and songs around the campfire \u2014 life for the several dozen youths at the Svoboda camp was hard.\n\nCampers were awakened in the middle of the night with a blast from a stun grenade. Stumbling out of their tents, soldiers in training struggled to hold AK-47s that were, in some cases, almost as tall as they were. They were required to carry the heavy rifles all day, and one of the girls broke down in tears from exhaustion.\n\nAt 18, Mykhailo was the oldest of the campers. The training, he said, was necessary.\n\n\"Every moment things can go wrong in our country. And one has to be ready for it,\" he said. \"That's why I came to this camp. To study how to protect myself and my loved ones\"", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was rushing back to Israel on Monday following a sudden, rare burst of fighting the previous night that left in doubt efforts to bring to an end months of relentless violence between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThe Israeli military said an officer was killed and another was moderately wounded during an operation in the southeast Gaza Strip, involving an exchange of gunfire. It did not disclose other details surrounding the incident.\n\nThe Palestinians said seven people, among them at least five militants, were killed in the conflagration.\n\nNetanyahu's office said he cut short a visit to Paris because of the flare-up and he was set to arrive back in Israel on Monday morning.\n\nThe unexpected spasm of violence came days after both Israel and Hamas had begun taking steps to ratchet down months of border fighting, that has seen thousands of protesters descend on the perimeter fence between Gaza and Israel, with many throwing stones, burning tires and hurling grenades at Israeli troops.\n\nAbout 170 demonstrators, many unarmed, have been killed by Israeli fire in the months of confrontations, which appeared to be reaching a turning point with the steps toward an unofficial cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. Last week, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million in aid to Gaza's cash-strapped Hamas rulers. Hamas responded by lowering the intensity of the border protest last Friday.\n\nWhile the fighting eased early on Monday, and the sides appeared to show restraint, the fate of the progress toward a truce remained uncertain.\n\nIt was not clear what exactly touched off Sunday's fighting.\n\nHamas' armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, said Israeli undercover forces in a civilian vehicle infiltrated 3 kilometers (about 2 miles), into Gaza on Sunday and fatally shot Nour el-Deen Baraka, its local commander in Khan Younis town. It said militants discovered the car and chased it down, prompting Israeli airstrikes that killed \"a number of people.\" The Israeli military said militants launched 17 rockets from Gaza toward Israeli communities, where school was cancelled in response.\n\nNetanyahu was in Paris, where he had joined dozens of world leaders in commemorating the end World War I.\n\nOn Sunday, he defended his decision to allow through the Qatari cash to Gaza as a way to avert an \"unnecessary war,\" maintain quiet for residents of southern Israel and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in the impoverished Gaza Strip.\n\nHamas has been leading the protests since March 30 in a bid to ease a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade that was imposed in 2007 in order to weaken the militant group. The blockade has led to over 50 percent unemployment and chronic power outages, and prevents most Gazans from being able to leave the tiny territory.\n\nIsrael says it is defending its border against militant infiltrations, but its army has come under international criticism because of the large number of unarmed protesters who have been shot.", "An NYPD cop put on a show from his patrol car in Manhattan on Saturday \u2014 singing a Backstreet Boys tune over the intercom.\n\nOfficer Richard Gunther belted out \u201cI Want It That Way\u201d by the boy band while he and his partner were in their patrol car parked in the East Village, according to video that captured the goof.\n\nGunther\u2019s singing of the \u201990s pop music over his radio was enough to make New Yorkers smile and appreciate the NYPD.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going viral for sure,\u201d a female onlooker can be heard saying on the video.\n\nThe Instagram user who posted the video said it brought a smile to his face.\n\n\u201cThe NYPD absolutely nailed it today,\u201d Jordan Haskins captioned the video. \u201cSo cool to see the humanity in our law enforcement.

In an interview with The Associated Press, she said Long was a \"ticking time bomb\" who constantly lost his temper, threw tantrums and would scream at coaches when he didn't like their decisions. She said she once witnessed him assault a fellow coach.\n\nThat coach, Dominique Colell, said Long grabbed her rear and midsection after she refused to return a cellphone. Another time, he used his hand to mimic shooting her, Colell said, adding that she feared for herself whenever she was around him.\n\nCluke said she also witnessed Long pretending to shoot Colell.\n\n\"When Dominique turned around and saw that, she turned pale as a ghost and it was very, very scary.\" Cluke said. \"Just sadistic. ... He was out of control. He would scream and cuss and his face would turn bright red and people would actually back away from him.\"\n\nLong, a 28-year-old former Marine machine-gunner who served in Afghanistan, opened fire during college night at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks on Wednesday night. He killed 11 people and a police officer who responded, and then fatally shot himself, police said.\n\nAuthorities have not determined a motive.\n\nColell kicked Long off the track team immediately after he assaulted her, but she and Cluke said the boy's track coach urged her to reconsider because that could compromise Long's goal of joining the Marines. The head track coach, Cluke said, reversed Colell's decision to throw Long off the team and told her she didn't have that authority, while the now-retired principal brushed it aside as a one-time incident.\n\nLong rejoined the team after apologizing in front of several coaches and administrators.\n\nCluke said she, Colell and her father, also a track coach at the school at the time, repeatedly reported Long's behavioral problems, to no avail.\n\n\"You need to do something about this kid. He needs some help.\" Cluke said she told administrators. \"And they're like, 'Well, he's got a good heart he'll be fine. Just talk to him.'\"\n\nEmails to various administrators at the high school were not immediately answered Sunday. Attempts to get comment by phone and in person from officials at the school and its district were unsuccessful Friday, when both were closed because of a massive and deadly wildfire in the area.\n\nCluke recalled a time when she and her father sat down with Long for a talk and asked him why he wanted to join the military. His answer, she said, \"is burned in my soul.\"\n\n\"He said he wanted to be in the Marines because he wanted to go fight in the war for our country and he wanted to kill for our country,\" she said. \"When you hear somebody say they want to be in the military because they want to kill people in the name of our country, that's chilling. It chilled me right down to my bones.\"\n\nShe said it's time for school administrators across the country to take behavioral problems seriously.\n\n\"It's not the military or video games or music that causes this,\" she said. \"It's the inaction of people in authority.\"\n\nShe said that if other coaches and school administrators had acted following complaints about Long, \"he could've gotten help and 12 innocent people wouldn't be dead now.\"\n\n\"The warning signs were there,\" she said.", "A Texas man thwarted his own burglary attempt Tuesday evening after bleeding to death inside the home he had broken into, police said.\n\nThe homeowner found 28-year-old Javier Tellez Jr. dead inside their El Paso home, KFOX-TV reported.\n\nFLORIDA SUSPECT BREWED A POT OF COFFEE, SMOKED CIGARETTE DURING BURGLARY, POLICE SAY\n\nThe homeowner told responding officers he had found the would-be burglar after discovering a broken window and pools of blood, police said in a news release.\n\nInvestigators determined the man had slashed his arms on the broken window and died from loss of blood, according to the release.\n\nAuthorities are continuing to investigate.", "A U.S. fighter pilot and weapons system officer were rescued Monday after their F/A 18 fighter jet crashed in the Philippine Sea following its takeoff from the USS Ronald Reagan, the Navy says -- marking the third incident landing the USS Ronald Reagan in the news during the last month.\n\nThe crash \u2013 which the Navy says was caused by some kind of mechanical issue that forced both aviators to eject \u2013 comes less than a month after a U.S. MH-60 Seahawk helicopter slammed into the decks of the USS Ronald Reagan shortly after takeoff.

None of the injuries were life-threatening, officials told Fox News. Their injuries ranged from minor cuts to broken bones.\n\nWeeks later, reports emerged that an investigation into the alleged distribution and use of LSD aboard the USS Ronald Reagan has grown to ensnare at least a dozen sailors.\n\nLt.

On Sunday, he listened as he was lectured on the dangers of nationalist isolation, and then he headed home just as the inaugural Paris Peace Summit was getting underway.\n\nThe visit made clear that, nearly two years after taking office, Trump has dramatically upended decades of American foreign policy posture, shaking allies. That includes French President Emmanuel Macron, who on Sunday warned that the \"ancient demons\" that caused World War I and millions of deaths were once again making headway.\n\nMacron, who has been urging a re-embrace of multinational organizations and cooperation that have been shunned by Trump, delivered a barely veiled rebuke of Trumpism at the weekend's centerpiece event: A gathering of dozens of leaders at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the base of the Arc de Triomphe to mark the passage of a century since the guns fell silent in a global war that killed millions. Bells tolled across Europe's Western Front and fighter jets passed overhead to mark the exact moment the devastating war came to a close.\n\nWith Trump and other leaders looking on, Macron took on the rising tide of populism in the United States and Europe and urged leaders not to turn their backs by turning inward.\n\n\"Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism: Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\" Macron said, adding that, when nations put their interests first and decide \"who cares about the others\" they \"erase the most precious thing a nation can have ... its moral values.\"\n\nAfter Trump was gone, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who recently announced that she will not be seeking re-election, made an impassioned plea for global cooperation at the peace forum, saying World War I had \"made clear what disastrous consequences a lack of compromise in politics and diplomacy can have.\"\n\nTrump, who has made clear that he has limited patience for broad, multilateral agreements, sat mostly stone-faced as he listened to Macron, who sees himself as Europe's foil to the rising nationalist sentiment, which has taken hold in Hungary and Poland among other countries.\n\nTrump did engage with his fellow leaders, attending a group welcome dinner hosted by Macron at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay on Saturday night and a lunch on Sunday. He also spent time with Macron on Saturday, when the two stressed their shared desire for more burden-sharing during a quick availability with reporters.\n\nBut Trump was terse during some of his private conversations with world leaders, according to people with direct knowledge of his visit. One of the people described the president as \"grumpy.\" They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.\n\nThe symbolism during Trump's visit couldn't have been more stark.\n\nTrump was missing from one of the weekend's most powerful images: A line of world leaders, walking shoulder to-shoulder in a somber, rain-soaked procession as the bells marking the exact moment that fighting ended \u2014 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918 \u2014 finished tolling.\n\nThe president and first lady Melania Trump had traveled to the commemoration separately \u2014 White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited security protocols \u2014 from the other dignitaries, who had traveled together by bus from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nAs Trump's motorcade was making its solo trip down the grand Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, which was closed to traffic, at least one topless woman breached tight security, running into the street and shouting \"fake peace maker\" as the cars passed. She had slogans, including the words \"Fake\" and \"Peace,\" written on her chest.\n\nPolice tackled the woman and the motorcade continued uninterrupted. The feminist activist group Femen later claimed responsibility.\n\nAlso traveling on his own was Russian President Vladimir Putin, who shook Trump's hand, flashed him a thumbs-up sign and patted Trump's arm as he arrived. Trump responded with a wide smile.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton had said at one point that Putin and Trump would meet in Paris, but they will instead hold a formal sit-down later this month at a world leaders' summit in Buenos Aires. A Kremlin official said later that U.S. and Russian officials decided to drop plans for the Paris meeting after French officials objected.\n\nTrump, who ran on an \"America First\" platform, has jarred European allies with his actions. He has slapped tariffs on the European Union, pulled the U.S. out of the landmark Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal and suggested he might be willing to pull the U.S. out of NATO if member counties don't significantly boost their defense spending. Trump's eagerness to get along with the Russian leader \u2014 in spite of Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and numerous other aggressive moves in recent years \u2014 has alarmed those who view Russia as a growing threat.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly branded himself a \"nationalist,\" despite criticism from some that the term has negative connotations. At a news conference last week, Trump defended his use of the phrase. \"You know what the word is? I love our country,\" he said, adding: \"You have nationalists. You have globalists. I also love the world and I don't mind helping the world, but we have to straighten out our country first. We have a lot of problems.\"\n\nBut Trump did not broach the divide as he paid tribute Sunday to U.S. and allied soldiers killed in World War I during \"a horrible, horrible war\" that marked America's emergence as a world power.\n\n\"We are gathered together at this hallowed resting place to pay tribute to the brave Americans who gave their last breath in that mighty struggle,\" Trump said at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in the suburbs of Paris, where more than 1,500 Americans who died in the war are buried.\n\n\"It is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended and to protect the peace they so nobly gave their lives to secure one century ago,\" he said after spending a moment, standing alone amid the cemetery's white crosses, holding a black umbrella.\n\nThe Veterans Day speech came a day after Trump was criticized for failing to visit a different American cemetery about 60 miles (100 kilometers) outside of Paris on Saturday because rain grounded the helicopter he had planned to take. A handful of senior administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, went in the president's place, while Trump remained behind at the ambassador's residence with no alternate schedule for hours.\n\nTrump delivered the speech as other leaders were gathered for the Paris Peace Forum, which aims to revive collective governance and international cooperation to tackle global challenges. Afterward he flew back to Washington.\n\nFrance was the epicenter of World War I, the first global conflict. Its role as host of the main international commemoration highlighted the point that the world mustn't stumble into war again, as it did so quickly and catastrophically with World War II.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Robert Burns and Julie Pace in Washington and Lori Hinnant and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press' WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nFollow Superville and Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/dsupervilleap and https://twitter.com/colvinj", "Play Audio Clip Listen to audio clip.\n\nShortly after the election results were in, Jeff Sessions was out of a job.

We\u2019re not supposed to use that word. You know what I am? I\u2019m a nationalist, OK? I\u2019m a nationalist.\u201d\n\nWho could Emmanuel Macron have meant when he said this today:\n\n\u201cPatriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism. Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism by saying \u2018our interests first, who cares about the others.\u2019 We erase what a nation holds dearest, what gives it life, what makes it grace, and what is essential \u2013 its moral values.\u201c\n\nOK, so let's take his words at face value. He said, \"patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism.\"\n\nIs it? I looked it up on Google. The definition of nationalism is \"patriotic feeling, principles or efforts.\" The first synonym, that means the same meaning as, not the opposite, listed for nationalism is literally \"patriotism\"\n\nAnd that's according to the globalists at Google!\n\nBut let's go beyond semantics. Let's take his argument, such as it is seriously\n\nThe president of France is saying it's wrong to put your own country's interests first. He thinks something else -- perhaps the European interest or the global interest should come first.\n\nBut who decides what that is?\n\nWhere does its legitimacy come from?\n\nHow is it accountable, and to whom?\n\nWhat is Macron's mandate, exactly, for privileging the European or the global over the national? He was elected with French votes, not global votes. --\n\nJust like President Trump was elected with American votes. At least he seems to understand that and understand who he's accountable to.\n\nMacron's attack on President Trump was highly revealing. It lays bare the astonishing arrogance of the globalist ruling class who think it's their moral duty to ignore democracy and instead run the world according to whatever makes life easier for the rootless and heartless global corporations that Macron and his gang of Davos elitists cravenly serve.\n\nAnd they have the nerve to lecture President Trump about morality!\n\nOne last point on all this.\n\nI was reading this book, \"What is the Constitution?\" with one of my sons this week. It tells the story of the Constitution. And here's something that caught my eye:\n\n\"Some leaders, like George Washington, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton, wanted the United States to be a strong nation with a solid central government on that would oversee all the states. These leaders were called nationalists\"\n\nSo Alexander Hamilton was a nationalist! Perhaps that might convince the elites that there really is nothing wrong with putting your country first, in fact, it's the only truly democratic thing to do.\n\nAdapted from Steve Hilton's monologue on \"The Next Revolution\" on November 11, 2018.", "A second high school coach of the gunman who killed 12 people at a Southern California bar last week has described him as volatile and sadistic, adding that he once told her he wanted to join the military so he could kill people for his country.\n\nEvie Cluke coached Ian David Long, a 28-year-old ex-Marine machine-gunner who served in Afghanistan, on Newbury Park High School\u2019s track team in 2007 and 2008.\n\nShe called him a \u201cticking time bomb.\u201d\n\nIn an interview Sunday with The Associated Press, Cluke recalled a time when she and her father sat down with Long for a talk and asked him why he wanted to join the military. His answer, she said, \u201cis burned in my soul.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said he wanted to be in the Marines because he wanted to go fight in the war for our country and he wanted to kill for our country,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you hear somebody say they want to be in the military because they want to kill people in the name of our country, that\u2019s chilling. It chilled me right down to my bones.\u201d\n\nShe said Long would lose his temper, throw tantrums and scream, and that she witnessed him assault a fellow coach.\n\nThat coach, Dominique Colell told local media outlets that Long grabbed her rear and midsection after she refused to return a cellphone. Another time, he used his hand to mimic shooting her.\n\n\u201cWhen Dominique turned around and saw that, she turned pale as a ghost and it was very, very scary.\u201d Cluke said. \u201cJust sadistic. ... He was out of control. He would scream and cuss and his face would turn bright red and people would actually back away from him.\u201d\n\nColell claimed she had run-ins with Long that convinced her that he was \u201cmentally disturbed\u201d and had \u201canger issues,\u201d before he left to join the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nColell said Long was \u201cthe only student that I was actually scared of when I coached there.\u201d\n\nBoth coaches said they reported the behavior to school officials, who did nothing. Colell kicked Long off the track team immediately after he assaulted her, but she and Cluke said the boy's track coach urged her to reconsider because that could compromise Long's goal of joining the Marines. The head track coach, Cluke said, reversed Colell's decision to throw Long off the team and told her she didn't have that authority, while the now-retired principal brushed it aside as a one-time incident.\n\n\u201cYou need to do something about this kid. He needs some help,\u201d Cluke said she told administrators. \u201cAnd they\u2019re like, \u2018Well, he\u2019s got a good heart he\u2019ll be fine. Just talk to him.\u2019\u201c\n\nSchool officials could not be reached for comment.\n\nPolice said Long had no criminal record. However, last April, yelling and loud banging noises coming from the home Long shared with his mother prompted a next-door neighbor to call authorities.\n\nDeputies responded and a mental health specialist who assessed Long worried he might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder but found no grounds to hospitalize him.\n\nAuthorities described an attack of military efficiency. When Long shot his .45-caliber pistol, he killed. All of the injured suffered cuts, bruises and other minor injuries in frantic attempts to escape the gunfire. Some smashed windows and jumped out.\n\nLong, who killed 12 people inside the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks on Wednesday night, posted to Instagram while inside the country music bar. Ventura County Sgt. Eric Bucshow told Fox News that Ian David Long posted on Instagram during the shooting at the bar, which was filled with about 150 people on its popular college night that attracts students from several nearby schools.\n\nThe post, created by the gunman as he methodically shot and reloaded, involved his mental state and whether people would believe he was sane, authorities said.\n\nA law enforcement source confirmed to Fox News that the shooter posted \u201crants\u201d before the massacre on his Facebook account. In those posts, Long said he hopes that people call him insane, and he mocked those who often offer \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d after an incident takes place.\n\nIn the Facebook posting, the source confirmed Long said, \u201cI hope they call me insane .. wouldn\u2019t that just be a big ball of irony? Yea, I\u2019m insane, but the only thing you people do after these shootings is \u2018hopes and prayers\u2019\u2026 or \u2018keep you in my thoughts\u2019 .. every time .. and wonder why these keep happening\u2026.\u201d\n\nAn autopsy determined that the gunman died from a self-inflicted gunshot, police said Saturday. Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub said an autopsy determined Long fatally shot himself.\n\nCluke said it\u2019s time for school administrators across America to take behavioral problems seriously.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the military or video games or music that causes this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the inaction of people in authority.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe warning signs were there,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "President Trump did not visit a World War I cemetery in northern France this weekend because his motorcade would have disrupted traffic in Paris and nearby suburbs for hours, an administration official told Fox News Sunday.\n\nTrump was scheduled to lay a wreath and observe a moment of silence Saturday at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial, located approximately 60 miles northeast of Paris. However, bad weather grounded the president's helicopter and the official told Fox News there was no backup plan to travel by car.\n\n\"President Trump did not want to cause that kind of unexpected disruption to the city and its people,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. She also noted that the trip to Aisne-Marne was 2.5 hours by car.\n\nTRUMP TAKES HEAT OVER SCRAPPED TRIP TO CEMETERY IN FRANCE\n\nThe president spent much of Saturday at the U.S. ambassador's residence following a meeting and lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump was in Paris for events to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.\n\nAttending the cemetery event in Trump's place were the White House chief of staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly; the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Gen. Joe Dunford; and several members of the White House staff. The Battle of Belleau Wood was a critical conflict in the war and a pivotal encounter in Marine Corps history.\n\nThe determination to ground Marine One, the president's helicopter, due to bad weather is made by the Marine Corps and the White House Military Office, which then presents the recommendation to the White House in collaboration with the Secret Service, according to a Secret Service official.\n\nTrump was criticized for not going to the cemetery by former White House officials David Frum and Ben Rhodes as well as Nicholas Soames, a grandson of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.\n\nParis was covered in clouds with drizzling rain through most of Saturday.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump attended a scheduled event honoring American war dead at a U.S. cemetery just outside of Paris.\n\n\n\nFox News' John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "Six more people have died in connection to the wildfire tearing through Northern California, a sheriff said Sunday evening.\n\nThe death toll in the northern blaze -- known as the Camp Fire -- rose to 29 as a result of the discoveries, which included five bodies located at homes and one that was found in a vehicle, Butte County Sheriff Cory Honea said. An additional 228 people were unaccounted for, he added.\n\nThe wildfire now matches the deadliest blaze on record in California history.\n\nThe Camp Fire, which tore through the town of Paradise, had burned 109,000 acres since it first began on Thursday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nMore than 6,400 residences were destroyed in the fire that stands at 25 percent containment, the agency said.\n\nAt least 31 people have died statewide in wildfires that have burned nearly 400 square miles in Northern and Southern California.\n\nDevastating images of Paradise, a town of roughly 27,000 residents, depicted destroyed homes and roads dotted with charred vehicles. Authorities called in a mobile DNA lab and anthropologists to help identify victims. Honea said the county consulted anthropologists from California State University at Chico because, in some cases, investigators have been able to recover only bones and bone fragments.\n\nThe devastation was so complete in some neighborhoods that \"it's very difficult to determine whether or not there may be human remains there,\" Honea said.\n\nBy early Sunday afternoon, one of the two black hearses stationed in Paradise had picked up another set of remains.\n\nPeople looking for friends or relatives called evacuation centers, hospitals, police and the coroner's office.\n\nSol Bechtold drove from shelter to shelter looking for his mother, Joanne Caddy, a 75-year-old widow whose house burned down along with the rest of her neighborhood in Magalia, just north of Paradise. She lived alone and did not drive.\n\nBechtold posted a flyer on social media, pinned it to bulletin boards at shelters and showed her picture around to evacuees, asking if anyone recognized her. He ran across a few of Caddy's neighbors, but they hadn't seen her.\n\nAs he drove through the smoke and haze to yet another shelter, he said, \"I'm also under a dark emotional cloud. Your mother's somewhere and you don't know where she's at. You don't know if she's safe.\"\n\nHe added: \"I've got to stay positive. She's a strong, smart woman.\"\n\nOfficials and relatives held out hope that many of those unaccounted for were safe and simply had no cellphones or other ways to contact loved ones. The sheriff's office in the stricken northern county set up a missing-persons call center to help connect people.\n\nThere were some stories of hope, like that of a 93-year-old World War II veteran was shown kindness and hospitality in the midst of devastation.\n\nBusinesswoman Tracy Grant was at the Forebay Aquatic Center in Oroville Thursday giving out food to people forced to evacuate their homes when she crossed paths with the veteran, Lee Brundige, who isn't sure whether anything remains of his house in Paradise, The Associated Press reported Sunday.\n\nBrundige initially refused the hamburger she offered, saying she should give it to someone who really needed it. She tried to get him to a shelter, but he said he was fine sleeping in his car.\n\nThe next day, she convinced him to come home with her when the sheriff's office told people to clear out of the parking lot due to worsening air.\n\n\"He looks at me and kind of grunted, 'No I don't want to take advantage of anyone, you're too kind.' So I said, 'This is my car. You're going to follow that bumper until we stop,\" she said.\n\nGERARD BUTLER SHARES PHOTO OF HIS MALIBU HOME MOSTLY BURNED TO ASHES BY WOOLSEY FIRE\n\nAfter they arrived at Grant's home, her boyfriend Josh Fox helped out by supplying Brundige with new clothes.\n\nThe elderly veteran has also found a companion in Grant\u2019s dog, Axle, who sits with him in a recliner they share.\n\nBrundige lived by himself at his home in Paradise but does not know if his home is still standing. Brundige's son, who lives in Southern California, knows that his father is okay, the outlet reported.\n\nSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE FANNED BY RETURN OF \u2018STRONG\u2019 GUSTY SANTA ANA WINDS\n\nThere were stories of heartbreaking loss as well. One of the Northern California fire's victims was an ailing woman whose body was found in bed in a burned-out house in Concow, near Paradise.\n\nEllen Walker, who was in her early 70s, was home alone when the fire struck on Thursday, according to Nancy Breeding, a family friend.\n\nBreeding said Walker's husband was at work and called a neighbor to tell his wife to evacuate, but she was on medication and might not have been alert. Authorities confirmed her death late Friday.\n\n\"A fireman took him to the house to confirm,\" Breeding said. \"This is a devastating thing, and it's happening to so many people.\"\n\nGov. Jerry Brown said California is requesting aid from the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has blamed \"poor\" forest management for the fires. Brown told a press briefing that federal and state governments must do more forest management but said that's not the source of the problem.\n\n\"Managing all the forests in everywhere we can does not stop climate change,\" Brown said. \"And those who deny that are definitely contributing to the tragedies that we're now witnessing, and will continue to witness in the coming years.\"\n\nFirefighters battling the blaze with shovels and bulldozers, flame retardants and hoses expected wind gusts up to 40 mph overnight Sunday. Officials said they expect the wind to die down by midday Monday, but there was still no rain in sight.\n\nCal Fire spokesman Bill Murphy warned that gusty winds predicted into Monday morning could spark \"explosive fire behavior.\"\n\nAbout 300,000 people statewide were under evacuation orders, most of them in Southern California.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "The supervisor of elections in Florida's heavily Democratic Palm Beach County said Sunday that she did not believe her department would meet a Thursday deadline to complete recounts in the Sunshine State's historically tight gubernatorial and Senate races, threatening to further confuse an increasingly chaotic and politically fraught process.\n\nThe supervisor, Susan Bucher, told reporters that she did not expect to meet the deadline due to aging equipment. Florida Department of State spokeswoman Sarah Revell told Fox News that under state law, if a county does not submit their results by the deadline, then the results on file at the time take their place. Revell added that Florida's Secretary of State has no authority to grant extensions.\n\n\"Supervisors of Elections are independent officials and they are responsible for deciding when to upgrade or modernize their equipment,\" Revell added.\n\nThe recount in most other major population centers, including Miami-Dade and Pinellas and Hillsborough counties in the Tampa Bay area, were taking place without incident on Sunday. Smaller counties are expected to begin their reviews Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nBucher spoke hours after the campaign of Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott -- which secured an early legal victory against Democratic-leaning Broward County officials over the weekend -- went back to court with a fresh salvo of emergency complaints against both Broward and Palm Beach counties. One complaint requests that state sheriff's officers \"impound and secure all voting machines, tallying devices and ballots when they are not in use until the conclusion of the recount.\"\n\nIn a separate lawsuit, Scott's team is asking a judge to throw out votes tallied by the Broward County Canvassing Board after Saturday's noon deadline, in apparent violation of state law, which requires that \"[t]he canvassing board shall submit ... unofficial returns to the Department of State for each federal, statewide, state, or multicounty office or ballot measure no later than ... noon on the fourth day after any general or other election.\"\n\n\u201cThe Broward and Palm Beach County Supervisors of Elections has already demonstrated a blatant disregard for Florida\u2019s elections laws, making it more important than ever that we continue to do everything possible to prevent fraud and ensure this recount is operated responsibly,\" Chris Hartline, a Scott spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nLawyer Marc Elias, who is representing the campaign of Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, fired back on Twitter.\n\n\"Lets [sic] be clear about what we are witnessing in Florida,\" Elias wrote. \"The sitting Governor is seeking to throw out lawful votes and seize the voting equipment in order to win an election.\"\n\n\"Somebody needs to cut down on the Red Bull,\" a Scott spokesperson wrote on Twitter, in response to a statement by Florida Democrats Executive Director Juan Penalosa that compared Scott to a Latin American dictator. \"We requested that ballots and voting machines be protected when not in use. The only reason not to protect the integrity of the ballots and the voting machines is if you are actively promoting or hoping for fraud.\"\n\nBut Democrats continued to bash the Republican's effort. \"If Rick Scott wanted to make sure every legal ballot is counted, he would not be suing to try and stop voters from having their legal ballot counted as intended,\" Nelson said in a statement. \"He's doing this for the same reason he's been making false and panicked claims about voter fraud -- he's worried that when all the votes are counted he'll lose this election. We will not allow him to undermine the democratic process and will use every legal tool available to protect the rights of Florida voters.\"\n\nUnofficial results show that Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis led Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points in the election for governor. In the Senate race, Scott's lead over Nelson is 0.14 percentage points. State law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Once completed, if the differences in any of the races are 0.25 percentage points or below, a hand recount will be ordered.\n\nThe litigation threw yet another wrench in an increasingly chaotic process reminiscent of the 2000 presidential election recount fiasco. In Broward County, the scheduled start of the recount was delayed Sunday because of a problem with one of the tabulation machines. The Republican Party accused Broward's supervisor of elections, Brenda Snipes, of continuing to compromise the process with \"incompetence and gross mismanagement\" following the delay, which was resolved within two hours.\n\n\n\nBroward County election planning director Joe D'Alessandro told Fox News that machines in Broward are currently resorting some 3.5 million pages of ballots, and officials said that process could take more than 30 hours alone before any actual counting begins.\n\nBroward County, the state's second-most populous, is emerging as the epicenter of controversy in the recount. Broward officials said they mistakenly counted 22 absentee ballots that had been rejected, mostly because the signature on the return envelope did not match the one on file.\n\nIt is a problem that appears impossible to fix because the ballots were mixed in with 205 legal ballots. Snipes, who has long been accused of mismanaging county elections and has been sanctioned by a judge for destroying ballots in a 2016 congressional race, said it would be unfair to throw out all the ballots.\n\n\"#BrowardElections office admits the vote count they submitted to state includes 22 illegal votes,\" Florida GOP Senator Marco Rubio wrote on Twitter Sunday. \"We know about these 22 because they got caught breaking law in reviewing 202 ballots. How can anyone trust more illegal votes aren\u2019t in their final count?\"\n\nUndervoting -- a phenomenon in which voters don't cast votes in all the races on the ballot -- has become a prominent issue in the race. Rubio pointed out that Broward County is showing that approximately 25,000 fewer votes were cast in the Senate race than the gubernatorial contest -- a significant undervote that could be explained by Snipes' ballot design, which placed the Senate contest directly below the ballot's instructions, out of line with other races.\n\nIn 2006, the last time Nelson was on the ballot alongside a gubernatorial race, only 4,100 fewer people in Broward voted in the Senate race than in the election for governor. (However, at the statewide level this year, 34,051 fewer people voted in the Senate race than the gubernatorial race, a lower figure than the 35,736 undervote in 2006 -- even though 3 million more votes were cast in 2018 compared to 2006.)\n\n\"How ironic would it be if those who are now bashing our criticism of Snipes in the end wind up arguing that a ballot design error made by her is the reason the Democrats lost?\" Rubio said Sunday.\n\nOther Republicans suggested that Democrats shouldn't get their hopes up as the recounts get underway.\n\n\"Scott trails DeSantis by 10,754 votes in Broward, and Nelson trails Gillum by 10,343,\" a Scott campaign source told Fox News. \"The idea that the undervotes in Broward County is an opportunity for Nelson to significantly close the gap is not and has never been based on anything but fantasy.\"\n\nThe recount in most other major population centers, including Miami-Dade and Pinellas and Hillsborough counties in the Tampa Bay area, was ongoing without incident on Sunday. Smaller counties are expected to begin their reviews Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly cried foul throughout the process, both in court and outside Florida election offices. On Saturday, GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz compared Broward County to a \"banana republic\" and posted video apparently showing him being denied access to election facilities on \"safety\" grounds.\n\nProtesters chanted, \"Lock her up\" outside the building earlier in the day, referring to Snipes.\n\nRubio and other Florida officials have posted numerous videos and images on social media apparently showing boxes of ballots being left behind in public spaces or improperly loaded onto private trucks.\n\nAt an emergency court hearing on Friday, state Judge Carol-Lisa Phillips ruled there has \u201cbeen a violation of the Florida Constitution,\u201d as well as the state\u2019s public records act, by Broward officials who had not turned over requested records about the number of votes to be counted. But, Gaetz said, Florida officials were still blocking Republicans from monitoring how they were handling boxes of ballots.\n\n\"We have very specific laws in the state to try to prevent fraud,\" Scott, the incumbent Florida governor, told \"Fox News Sunday\" host Chris Wallace. \"We had to go to court to force the supervisor of elections in Palm Beach County and Broward County to comply with the law, which is there to prevent fraud.\"\n\nScott added: \"Sen. Nelson is clearly trying to commit fraud to win this election, that\u2019s all this is.\" Asked to elaborate on his accusation, he replied, \"Well, it's his team.\"\n\n\"Sen. Nelson is clearly trying to commit fraud to win this election.\" \u2014 GOP Senate candidate Rick Scott\n\n\"His lawyers said that a noncitizen should vote, that\u2019s one,\" Scott continued. \"Two, he\u2019s gone to trial and said that fraudulent ballots should be counted, ballots have already been thrown out because they were not done properly. He said those should be counted.\"\n\nJUDGE SIDES WITH RICK SCOTT, REPUBLICANS, ORDERS FLORIDA ELECTION OFFICIALS TO COMPLY WITH LAW\n\nLawyers for Nelson and Gillum on Friday had objected to the rejection of a provisional ballot cast by a noncitizen, according to a transcript obtained by Fox News.\n\nThe incident occurred during a canvassing meeting in Palm Beach County, where provisional ballots were being examined. According to the draft transcript of the meeting, taken by a court reporter hired by the Florida Republican Party, a provisional ballot was ordered excluded from the count, as it came from a non-U.S. citizen.\n\nThe Nelson campaign distanced itself from the objections, which it said that it had not authorized.\n\nThe recount reviews are an unprecedented step in Florida, a state that's notorious for election results decided by the thinnest of margins. State officials said they weren't aware of any other time either a race for governor or U.S. Senate in Florida required a recount, let alone both in the same election.\n\nSnipes, the Broward County election supervisor who has held her office since 2003, is no stranger to controversy. Earlier this year, Scott's administration said it was monitoring her office after a judge ruled in May the county broke federal law by destroying ballots in Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz's 2016 Democratic primary race against Tim Canova, Politico reported.\n\nSnipes claimed the issue had been \"blown out of proportion.\"\n\nIn August, a judge sided with the Florida GOP in its challenge of how the county handled absentee ballots. Republicans claimed Snipes' office was opening ballots in private, preventing people from challenging if they were properly cast, according to Politico.\n\nAnd then in 2016, Broward County violated the law when it posted early voting results online before polls even closed, the Miami Herald reported.\n\n\n\nTRUMP 'WATCHING CLOSELY' WHAT HAPPENS IN FLORIDA, SAYS DEMS TRYING TO STEAL ELECTIONS\n\nAs the recount unfolded, Republicans urged their Democratic opponents to give up and allow the state to move on.\n\nBoth the state elections division, which Scott runs, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement have said they have found no evidence of voter fraud. Gillum and Nelson have argued each vote should be counted and the process allowed to take its course.\n\nFlorida is also conducting a recount in a third statewide race. Democrat Nikki Fried had a 0.07 percentage point lead over Republican state Rep. Matt Caldwell in the race for agriculture commissioner, one of Florida's three Cabinet seats.\n\nFrom a distant glance, the recounts might dredge up memories of the 2000 presidential recount, when it took more than five weeks for Florida to declare George W. Bush the winner over Al Gore by 537 votes, thus giving Bush the presidency.\n\nBut much has changed since then. In 2000, each county had a separate voting system. Many used punch cards \u2014 voters poked out chads, leaving tiny holes in their ballots representing their candidates. Some voters, however, didn't fully punch out the presidential chad or gave it just a little push. Those hanging and dimpled chads had to be examined by the canvassing boards, a lengthy, tiresome and often subjective process that became fodder for late-night comedians.\n\nNow the state requires that all Florida counties use ballots where voters use a pen to fill in a circle next to their candidate's name, much like a student does when taking a multiple-choice test. It also now clearly mandates how the recount will proceed.\n\nThose ballots are now being run through scanning machines in each county for a second time under the watchful eye of representatives of both parties and the campaigns. Any ballot that cannot be read for any of the recounted races will be put aside.\n\nIf a race's statewide margin falls below 0.25 percentage points after the machine count, the state will order a manual recount in each county. At that point, only the rejected ballots for that race will be examined by counting teams to determine if the voters' intentions were obvious. For example, some voters circle the candidate's name instead of filling in the ballot correctly and some cross out their vote and then mark another candidate.\n\nIf either side objects to a counting team's decision or the team can't make one, the ballot will be forwarded to the county's canvassing board, with the three members voting on the final decision. The members are usually the county supervisor of elections, a judge and the chair of the county commissioners.\n\nFox News' Peter Doocy, Ivonne Amor and Kathleen Reuschle and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "A senior Hamas militant and an Israeli soldier were among those killed Sunday evening as a new round of fighting broke out in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Israeli military initially reported an \"exchange of fire\" had taken place during operational activity in Gaza and said that \"all IDF soldiers back in Israel.\" It later clarified that one soldier was killed in the exchange and a second was moderately injured.\n\nHamas' armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, claimed that Israeli undercover forces in a civilian vehicle infiltrated two miles into Gaza and fatally shot one of its commanders, identified as Nour el-Deen Baraka.

More than 160 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the border protests, in which Palestinians throw rocks, burning tires and grenades toward Israeli troops.\n\nHamas has been leading the protests since March 30 in a bid to ease a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade that was imposed in 2007 to weaken the militant group.

In return, Israel wants quiet and an end to the border protests.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters Sunday that the money was \u201cthe right step\u201d at the moment, and that he was committed to restoring quiet along the Israel-Gaza frontier and preventing a humanitarian crisis in the coastal Palestinian territory.\n\n\u201cEvery action, without exception, has a price,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t handle the price you cannot lead. And I can handle the price.\u201d\n\nLater, at a press conference in Paris, when asked about his longer-term vision for Gaza, Netanyahu said there could be no political resolution as long as Hamas is in power.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a political resolution with those who are committed to your dissolution, to your destruction. That\u2019s absurd,\u201d he said. The alternative is to \u201cdo the minimal things necessary to maintain our security and to prevent the collapse of the humanitarian situation,\u201d he added.\n\nIsraeli media reported through Twitter that Netyanhu would cut short his trip to Paris and return to Israeli Sunday evening. Netanyahu was in Paris along with dozens of world leaders to commemorate the centenary of the end of World War I.\n\nSunday\u2019s development shattered what appeared to be a turning point after months of bloodshed along the Israel-Gaza border, with weekly Hamas-led protests drawing thousands to the perimeter fence with Israel. More than 160 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the border protests, in which Palestinians throw rocks, burning tires and grenades toward Israeli troops.\n\nHamas has been leading the protests since March 30 in a bid to ease a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade that was imposed in 2007 to weaken the militant group. The blockade has led to over 50 percent unemployment and chronic power outages and prevents most Gazans from being able to leave the tiny territory.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "Rep.

The US would then be able to freeze Houthi-connected financial assets, impose penalties on anyone deemed to be providing \u201cmaterial support\u201d to the group and prosecute individuals considered to be backing them.\n\nFor more than three years, the international community has been unsuccessfully trying to orchestrate an end to the bloody war in Yemen, waged between a Saudi Arabia-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi insurgency group. The conflict has left more than 11,000 dead, tens of thousands more wounded and spiraled into a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nDel Wilder, a counterterrorism specialist, and former US government operative said that the designation would merely be stating the obvious.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows they are terrorists and that they\u2019re controlled by Iran, which itself is a \u2018terrorist organization,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut until there is regime change in Iran the Houthis, Hezbollah, Hamas, and others will continue to go about the business of committing acts of terror and disruption.\u201d\n\nYet James Williamson, a retired Army special operations colonel and founder of OPSEC, a non-partisan advocacy organization focused on protecting national intelligence assets, noted that such a designation would likely do no harm, but would be more a \u201csymbolic gesture than actually having a measurable impact.\u201d\n\nKamran Bokhari, a specialist on the geopolitics of the Middle East with the University of Ottawa's Professional Development Institute, concurred that the designation was not likely to make much difference.\n\n\u201cLook at the number of declared terrorist entities, yet they continue to operate and the conflicts they engage in continue,\u201d he said. \u201cLike sanctions, these designations assume the key stakeholders will actively work to isolate the groups in question, which rarely happens.\u201d\n\nHowever, others say that designating the Houthis as terrorists would have a detrimental impact.\n\nOne official from Oman, a \u201cneutral on foreign policy\u201d country in the region which allows Houthi leadership to seek refuge in its capital Muscat, expressed concern to Fox News that the designation would hamper peace talks and provide no solution to the crisis.\n\nIn Afghanistan, for example, the U.S. has refrained from formally characterizing the Taliban as a foreign terrorist organization to keep all pathways open for peace talks and a political settlement to that long-running conflict.\n\nIt also remains unclear exactly how broad Iranian popular support is for the Houthis, potentially limiting blowback on the Tehran government.\n\nFurthermore, aid groups have expressed concern that the terrorist insignia would then require them to jump through extra hoops and seek extra permissions to operate in such areas\n\nMohamed Abdel Salam, the spokesman for the Houthis, who are known officially as Ansar Allah -- \u201cHelpers of God\u201d \u2013 acknowledged the group's Iran ties to Fox News in an exclusive in late July, but dismissed claims Iran was arming and funding them.

We don\u2019t deny that we have injuries and patients, Yemeni patients, receiving treatment in Iran,\u201d Salam asserted. \u201cWe don\u2019t deny that we have satellite channels being operated from Beirut but this doesn\u2019t mean this is an Iranian influence.

John McCain, who died earlier this year.\n\nMcCain hasn\u2019t been shy about posting tributes to her father since he died at 81 in late August after a battle with brain cancer. His daughter took to Twitter on Sunday to share her thoughts on both her decorated father as well as U.S. military veterans in general.\n\n\u201cToday on #VeteransDay we remember and honor those who have selflessly served and sacrificed. Those who have and continue to fight to protect our freedoms -I am forever grateful,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI miss you so much Dad, thank you for showing me what fighting for something greater than yourself is.\u201d\n\nThe tweet came with an image of John McCain that appears to be from his days in the military where he fought in the Vietnam War. John survived five years as a prisoner of war after being captured. As previously reported, McCain was offered early release by his captors, after they learned that his father was a notable naval officer. However, he refused to leave before the other prisoners were free. His injuries from his time in captivity remained with him for the remainder of his life, most noticeably restricting the movement of his arms.\n\n\"My father is gone, and I miss him as only an adoring daughter can,\" Meghan wrote at the time of his death. \"He was a great fire who burned bright, and we lives in his light and warmth for so very long. We know that his flame lives on, in each of us.

Florida Department of State spokeswoman Sarah Revell told Fox News that under state law, if a county does not submit their results by the deadline, then the results on file at the time take their place. Revell added that Florida's Secretary of State has no authority to grant extensions.\n\n\"Supervisors of Elections are independent officials and they are responsible for deciding when to upgrade or modernize their equipment,\" Revell added.\n\nThe recount in most other major population centers, including Miami-Dade and Pinellas and Hillsborough counties in the Tampa Bay area, were taking place without incident on Sunday. Smaller counties are expected to begin their reviews Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nBucher spoke hours after the campaign of Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott -- which secured an early legal victory against Democratic-leaning Broward County officials over the weekend -- went back to court with a fresh salvo of emergency complaints against both Broward and Palm Beach counties. One complaint requests that state sheriff's officers \"impound and secure all voting machines, tallying devices and ballots when they are not in use until the conclusion of the recount.\"\n\nIn a separate lawsuit, Scott's team is asking a judge to throw out votes tallied by the Broward County Canvassing Board after Saturday's noon deadline, in apparent violation of state law, which requires that \"[t]he canvassing board shall submit ... unofficial returns to the Department of State for each federal, statewide, state, or multicounty office or ballot measure no later than ... noon on the fourth day after any general or other election.\"\n\n\u201cThe Broward and Palm Beach County Supervisors of Elections has already demonstrated a blatant disregard for Florida\u2019s elections laws, making it more important than ever that we continue to do everything possible to prevent fraud and ensure this recount is operated responsibly,\" Chris Hartline, a Scott spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nLawyer Marc Elias, who is representing the campaign of Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, fired back on Twitter.\n\n\"Lets [sic] be clear about what we are witnessing in Florida,\" Elias wrote. \"The sitting Governor is seeking to throw out lawful votes and seize the voting equipment in order to win an election.\"\n\n\"Somebody needs to cut down on the Red Bull,\" a Scott spokesperson wrote on Twitter, in response to a statement by Florida Democrats Executive Director Juan Penalosa that compared Scott to a Latin American dictator. \"We requested that ballots and voting machines be protected when not in use. The only reason not to protect the integrity of the ballots and the voting machines is if you are actively promoting or hoping for fraud.\"\n\nBut Democrats continued to bash the Republican's effort. \"If Rick Scott wanted to make sure every legal ballot is counted, he would not be suing to try and stop voters from having their legal ballot counted as intended,\" Nelson said in a statement. \"He's doing this for the same reason he's been making false and panicked claims about voter fraud -- he's worried that when all the votes are counted he'll lose this election. We will not allow him to undermine the democratic process and will use every legal tool available to protect the rights of Florida voters.\"\n\nUnofficial results show that Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis led Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points in the election for governor. In the Senate race, Scott's lead over Nelson is 0.14 percentage points. State law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Once completed, if the differences in any of the races are 0.25 percentage points or below, a hand recount will be ordered.\n\nThe litigation threw yet another wrench in an increasingly chaotic process reminiscent of the 2000 presidential election recount fiasco. In Broward County, the scheduled start of the recount was delayed Sunday because of a problem with one of the tabulation machines. The Republican Party accused Broward's supervisor of elections, Brenda Snipes, of continuing to compromise the process with \"incompetence and gross mismanagement\" following the delay, which was resolved within two hours.\n\n\n\nBroward County election planning director Joe D'Alessandro told Fox News that machines in Broward are currently resorting some 3.5 million pages of ballots, and officials said that process could take more than 30 hours alone before any actual counting begins.\n\nBroward County, the state's second-most populous, is emerging as the epicenter of controversy in the recount. Broward officials said they mistakenly counted 22 absentee ballots that had been rejected, mostly because the signature on the return envelope did not match the one on file.\n\nIt is a problem that appears impossible to fix because the ballots were mixed in with 205 legal ballots. Snipes, who has long been accused of mismanaging county elections and has been sanctioned by a judge for destroying ballots in a 2016 congressional race, said it would be unfair to throw out all the ballots.\n\n\"#BrowardElections office admits the vote count they submitted to state includes 22 illegal votes,\" Florida GOP Senator Marco Rubio wrote on Twitter Sunday. \"We know about these 22 because they got caught breaking law in reviewing 202 ballots. How can anyone trust more illegal votes aren\u2019t in their final count?\"\n\nUndervoting -- a phenomenon in which voters don't cast votes in all the races on the ballot -- has become a prominent issue in the race. Rubio pointed out that Broward County is showing that approximately 25,000 fewer votes were cast in the Senate race than the gubernatorial contest -- a significant undervote that could be explained by Snipes' ballot design, which placed the Senate contest directly below the ballot's instructions, out of line with other races.\n\nIn 2006, the last time Nelson was on the ballot alongside a gubernatorial race, only 4,100 fewer people in Broward voted in the Senate race than in the election for governor. (However, at the statewide level this year, 34,051 fewer people voted in the Senate race than the gubernatorial race, a lower figure than the 35,736 undervote in 2006 -- even though 3 million more votes were cast in 2018 compared to 2006.)\n\n\"How ironic would it be if those who are now bashing our criticism of Snipes in the end wind up arguing that a ballot design error made by her is the reason the Democrats lost?\" Rubio said Sunday.\n\nOther Republicans suggested that Democrats shouldn't get their hopes up as the recounts get underway.\n\n\"Scott trails DeSantis by 10,754 votes in Broward, and Nelson trails Gillum by 10,343,\" a Scott campaign source told Fox News. \"The idea that the undervotes in Broward County is an opportunity for Nelson to significantly close the gap is not and has never been based on anything but fantasy.\"\n\nThe recount in most other major population centers, including Miami-Dade and Pinellas and Hillsborough counties in the Tampa Bay area, was ongoing without incident on Sunday. Smaller counties are expected to begin their reviews Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly cried foul throughout the process, both in court and outside Florida election offices. On Saturday, GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz compared Broward County to a \"banana republic\" and posted video apparently showing him being denied access to election facilities on \"safety\" grounds.\n\nProtesters chanted, \"Lock her up\" outside the building earlier in the day, referring to Snipes.\n\nRubio and other Florida officials have posted numerous videos and images on social media apparently showing boxes of ballots being left behind in public spaces or improperly loaded onto private trucks.\n\nAt an emergency court hearing on Friday, state Judge Carol-Lisa Phillips ruled there has \u201cbeen a violation of the Florida Constitution,\u201d as well as the state\u2019s public records act, by Broward officials who had not turned over requested records about the number of votes to be counted. But, Gaetz said, Florida officials were still blocking Republicans from monitoring how they were handling boxes of ballots.\n\n\"We have very specific laws in the state to try to prevent fraud,\" Scott, the incumbent Florida governor, told \"Fox News Sunday\" host Chris Wallace. \"We had to go to court to force the supervisor of elections in Palm Beach County and Broward County to comply with the law, which is there to prevent fraud.\"\n\nScott added: \"Sen. Nelson is clearly trying to commit fraud to win this election, that\u2019s all this is.\" Asked to elaborate on his accusation, he replied, \"Well, it's his team.\"\n\n\"Sen. Nelson is clearly trying to commit fraud to win this election.\" \u2014 GOP Senate candidate Rick Scott\n\n\"His lawyers said that a noncitizen should vote, that\u2019s one,\" Scott continued. \"Two, he\u2019s gone to trial and said that fraudulent ballots should be counted, ballots have already been thrown out because they were not done properly. He said those should be counted.\"\n\nJUDGE SIDES WITH RICK SCOTT, REPUBLICANS, ORDERS FLORIDA ELECTION OFFICIALS TO COMPLY WITH LAW\n\nLawyers for Nelson and Gillum on Friday had objected to the rejection of a provisional ballot cast by a noncitizen, according to a transcript obtained by Fox News.\n\nThe incident occurred during a canvassing meeting in Palm Beach County, where provisional ballots were being examined. According to the draft transcript of the meeting, taken by a court reporter hired by the Florida Republican Party, a provisional ballot was ordered excluded from the count, as it came from a non-U.S. citizen.\n\nThe Nelson campaign distanced itself from the objections, which it said that it had not authorized.\n\nThe recount reviews are an unprecedented step in Florida, a state that's notorious for election results decided by the thinnest of margins. State officials said they weren't aware of any other time either a race for governor or U.S. Senate in Florida required a recount, let alone both in the same election.\n\nSnipes, the Broward County election supervisor who has held her office since 2003, is no stranger to controversy. Earlier this year, Scott's administration said it was monitoring her office after a judge ruled in May the county broke federal law by destroying ballots in Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz's 2016 Democratic primary race against Tim Canova, Politico reported.\n\nSnipes claimed the issue had been \"blown out of proportion.\"\n\nIn August, a judge sided with the Florida GOP in its challenge of how the county handled absentee ballots. Republicans claimed Snipes' office was opening ballots in private, preventing people from challenging if they were properly cast, according to Politico.\n\nAnd then in 2016, Broward County violated the law when it posted early voting results online before polls even closed, the Miami Herald reported.\n\n\n\nTRUMP 'WATCHING CLOSELY' WHAT HAPPENS IN FLORIDA, SAYS DEMS TRYING TO STEAL ELECTIONS\n\nAs the recount unfolded, Republicans urged their Democratic opponents to give up and allow the state to move on.\n\nBoth the state elections division, which Scott runs, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement have said they have found no evidence of voter fraud. Gillum and Nelson have argued each vote should be counted and the process allowed to take its course.\n\nFlorida is also conducting a recount in a third statewide race. Democrat Nikki Fried had a 0.07 percentage point lead over Republican state Rep. Matt Caldwell in the race for agriculture commissioner, one of Florida's three Cabinet seats.\n\nFrom a distant glance, the recounts might dredge up memories of the 2000 presidential recount, when it took more than five weeks for Florida to declare George W. Bush the winner over Al Gore by 537 votes, thus giving Bush the presidency.\n\nBut much has changed since then. In 2000, each county had a separate voting system. Many used punch cards \u2014 voters poked out chads, leaving tiny holes in their ballots representing their candidates. Some voters, however, didn't fully punch out the presidential chad or gave it just a little push. Those hanging and dimpled chads had to be examined by the canvassing boards, a lengthy, tiresome and often subjective process that became fodder for late-night comedians.\n\nNow the state requires that all Florida counties use ballots where voters use a pen to fill in a circle next to their candidate's name, much like a student does when taking a multiple-choice test. It also now clearly mandates how the recount will proceed.\n\nThose ballots are now being run through scanning machines in each county for a second time under the watchful eye of representatives of both parties and the campaigns. Any ballot that cannot be read for any of the recounted races will be put aside.\n\nIf a race's statewide margin falls below 0.25 percentage points after the machine count, the state will order a manual recount in each county. At that point, only the rejected ballots for that race will be examined by counting teams to determine if the voters' intentions were obvious. For example, some voters circle the candidate's name instead of filling in the ballot correctly and some cross out their vote and then mark another candidate.\n\nIf either side objects to a counting team's decision or the team can't make one, the ballot will be forwarded to the county's canvassing board, with the three members voting on the final decision. The members are usually the county supervisor of elections, a judge and the chair of the county commissioners.\n\nFox News' Peter Doocy, Ivonne Amor and Kathleen Reuschle and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nA feminist activist pretending to be a photographer managed to breach security at a huge international ceremony in Paris and disrupt U.S. Presidential Donald Trump's motorcade as part of a peace protest.\n\nWith thousands of security forces deployed around the French capital, questions swirled around how the woman and two other activists from feminist group Femen got so close to scores of world leaders gathered on the Champs-Elysees to mark 100 years since the end of World War I.\n\nPhotographers accredited by the French presidential palace noticed that a woman in their midst was using a fake identity, according to Ludovic Marin, an Agence France Presse photographer who heads the media liaison committee with the French presidential palace.\n\nThe photographers alerted French presidential officials as well as police, and the woman was led away, Marin said. However, soon afterward she dashed out onto the Champs-Elysees in front of Trump's motorcade, shouting \"fake peace maker.\"\n\nAt that point, she was detained along with two other Femen protesters in the crowds of onlookers along the Champs-Elysees. All three had \"fake peace makers\" scrawled across their breasts, according to Inna Shevchenko, one of Femen's leaders.\n\nThe three are facing charges of sexual exhibitionism, a judicial official said.\n\nShevchenko would not comment on the fake photographer ploy. She said all three arrested activists had been in areas open to the general public, and that their action was peaceful.\n\nMarin expressed concern that the woman \"usurped the identity\" of a legitimate photographer to get permission to cover the high-security event, and that this could have negative consequences for real photographers seeking permission to cover presidential events.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's office would not comment on how the woman was accredited using a false identity.\n\nA Paris police official said authorities were investigating the breach. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner sought to play down the incident, and was quoted by BFM television as saying the women were unarmed and security of the event was \"in no way threatened.\"\n\nFemen activists have breached security before at major events and staged protests in front of Russian President Vladimir Putin, former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and others.\n\nShevchenko said the point of Sunday's protest was to \"denounce this hypocrisy\" of holding an event celebrating peace with leaders such as Trump and Putin \"who represent everything but not peace.\"\n\nShe singled out Trump for criticism for his \"aggressive attitude toward European leaders and hostile ideas\" toward multilateral cooperation.\n\nMacron also criticized the kind of nationalism that Trump espouses, but his office insisted on the importance of inviting the American president and other leaders because of their role in World War I.\n\nShevechenko dismissed the \"sexual exhibitionism\" accusation as an effort by French authorities to \"say that women's bodies are supposed to be regarded as sexual by definition. We claim the opposite, that women's bodies are sexual when women decide it, and they can be political when we decide it.\"", "The incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee this week said that when the new Congress is seated in January, Democrats plan to scrutinize whether President Trump abused his authority by taking adverse action against retail giant Amazon and two of his bitter left-leaning media rivals: CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in an interview with \"Axios on HBO\" that he and his colleagues will employ committee subpoena powers -- which are backed by the legal threat of contempt of Congress -- to conduct the triple-threaded inquiry into Trump's possible use of the \"instruments of state power to punish the press.\"\n\nSpecifically, Schiff charged that Trump \"was secretly meeting with the postmaster [general] in an effort to browbeat\" her into \"raising postal rates on Amazon,\" whose founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, separately owns The Washington Post.\n\n\"This appears to be an effort by the president to use the instruments of state power to punish Jeff Bezos and The Washington Post,\" Schiff said in the interview.\n\nThe president signed an executive order earlier this year mandating a review of what he called the \"unsustainable financial path\" of the United States Postal Service (USPS). And he has reportedly met with Postmaster General Megan Brennan several times to push for hikes to the shipping rates paid by companies like Amazon, although there are no indications he did so to seek political payback.\n\nTrump has long derided the political coverage at the Post, which is fiercely and relentlessly criticial of the White House, as a lobbying tool for Bezos. Most recently, the White House has contradicted the Post's unequivocal reporting that it had shared a \"doctored\" video of CNN reporter Jim Acosta making contact with a White House intern during a press conference last week, as a Buzzfeed analysis suggested the changes in the video could have resulted inadvertently from the conversion of the footage to the lower-fidelity .gif format commonly used on Twitter.\n\nBut Trump has also feuded specifically with Amazon throughout the year, saying it is taking advantage of taxpayer-subsidized shipping rates.\n\nIn March, he argued in a series of tweets that the online retailer\u2019s \u201cscam\u201d shipping deal with the USPS -- which affords Amazon generous discounts -- is costing the agency \u201cbillions of dollars.\u201d\n\nWhile the USPS has lost money for 11 years, Trump's critics have claimed that package delivery -- which has been a relative bright spot for the service as it competes in that space with UPS and FedEx -- is not the main reason. Boosted by e-commerce, the Postal Service has experienced double-digit increases in revenue from delivering packages despite offering discounts to retailers, even as the agency is hit with significantly increased mandatory pension and health care costs, as well as precipitous declines in first-class letters and marketing mail.\n\nBut it could be that the USPS is undercharging Amazon for its services. Although federal law ostensibly requires that the USPS' deals with Amazon be at least a break-even proposition for the government, the agency's profits from parcel deliveries are difficult to accurately calculate, owing to its complicated hybrid-monopoly structure and accounting documents that raise questions as to its actual costs.\n\nSchiff also raised the possibility that the Trump administration's opposition to AT&T's $85 billion takeover of Time Warner on antitrust grounds may have been motivated by the president's animus toward CNN, whose parent company is Time Warner. Trump frequently claims that CNN speads \"fake news\" and that when it does so, it is acting as the \"enemy of the people.\"\n\n\"We don't know, for example, whether the effort to hold up the merger of the parent of CNN was a concern over antitrust, or whether this was an effort merely to punish CNN,\" Schiff said, without offering evidence.\n\nWHAT ARE THE MAJOR LEGISLATIVE BATTLEGROUNDS BETWEEN DEMS, GOP IN 2019?\n\n\"It is very squarely within our responsibility to find out,\" Schiff said. Along with incoming House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and other top Democrats, Schiff will have a mandate to serve a slew of subpoenas on the Trump administration.\n\nBut former GOP Judiciary Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, who is now a Fox News contributor, told Politico in October that Cummings and Schiff shouldn't get their hopes up.\n\n\u201cIf [North Carolina Rep.] Mark Meadows and [Ohio Rep.] Jim Jordan can\u2019t get documents out of the White House, I don\u2019t know why Elijah Cummings and the Democrats think they\u2019ll do any better,\u201d Chaffetz said.\n\nStill, Democrats had signaled even before last week's midterm elections that they would aggressively investigate the Trump administration if they took power in Congress. Bogging down the White House with burdensome document requests and subpoenas could indeed backfire, political analysts tell Fox News, but there is little doubt that the strategy -- made more viable by heightened partisanship and loosened congressional norms -- would impair Republicans' messaging and even policy goals for the next two years.\n\n\"Well, we are responsible,\" House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, who is campaigning to reclaim her role as House speaker, said Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"We are not scattershot. We are not doing any investigation for a political purpose, but to seek the truth. So I think a word that you could describe about how Democrats will go forward in this regard is we will be very strategic.\"\n\nBut Pelosi has previously suggested that she would, indeed, use the threat of subpoenea for political gain.\n\nMAXINE WATERS, SCHIFF TO TAKE HIGH-PROFILE COMMITTEE POSTS IN NEW HOUSE\n\n\u201cSubpoena power is interesting, to use it or not to use it,\u201d Pelosi said at a conference in October, referring to the authority of House committees to summon individuals and organizations to testify or provide documents under penalty of perjury. \u201cIt is a great arrow to have in your quiver in terms of negotiating on other subjects.\" She added that she would use the power \"strategically.\" (Trump has flatly called Pelosi's plan \"illegal.\")\n\nPelosi's approach would mark the continuation of a trend. Research conducted by Cornell University political science professor Douglas Kriner, who co-wrote the 2016 book \"Investigating the President: Congressional Checks on Presidential Power,\" underscores the increasingly political nature of House investigations.\n\n\"We examined every congressional investigation from 1898 to 2014 \u2013 more than 11,900 days of investigative hearings,\" Kriner told Fox News. \"What we found is that divided government is a major driver of investigations in the House. This is particularly true in periods of intense partisan polarization. For example, from 1981-2014, the House averaged holding 67 days of investigative hearings per year in divided government, versus only 18 per year in unified government.\"\n\nKriner added that modern congressional probes seem geared toward \"maximiz[ing] the political damage on the White House,\" rather than producing more substantive results. \"Investigations are less likely to trigger new legislation than in previous, less polarized eras,\" Kriner told Fox News.\n\nOn Election Day, Pelosi vowed to \u201crestor[e] the Constitution\u2019s checks and balances to the Trump administration\" by enhancing transparency and accountability. But Trump last week signaled he had no patience for that approach, which he characterized as an expensive folly.\n\n\"If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level. Two can play that game!\" Trump tweeted.", "While wrapping up a concert in San Diego over the weekend, singer Morrissey was punched in the face after aggressive fans stormed the stage.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the singer was swept off the stage in the middle of his encore at the San Diego Symphony Hall on Saturday. In a video that\u2019s reportedly from the event, several people can be seen trying to get past security to the singer. Eventually, one manages to sneak by and lands a blow to Morrissey while he\u2019s trying to continue the performance.\n\nHe was quickly ushered off stage as security got things under control, moving the alleged attacker out in a chokehold. Fans reportedly waited to see if the star would return to finish out the encore, but soon realized that the concert was over and left.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s unclear what motivated the attack.TMZ posted a video from the incident as well a YouTube user by the name of Tamago Sandwich, both of which can be watched below. However, despite how it may look, a statement provided to Fox News downplays the incident as not being nearly as violent as it looks in the videos.\n\n\u201cNobody tried to punch M last night. Morrissey's fans are not malicious. The fans were simply doing what they have been doing for almost 30 years. Trying anything they could do to jump onstage and touch him, or hug him,\u201d Morrissey's rep, Peter Katsis, said. \u201cThe fan in question was certainly more aggressive in reaching out for him than most, so security had to do their job and subdue the fan. That's all it was. In the end, no one was hurt, and no one was arrested.\u201d\n\nKatsis also noted that the alleged attacker, who he names as Carlos Rodriguez, posted on the star's Facebook statement to note that he is a fan that was caught up in the moment.\n\n\"Thank you for clearing this up. I admit it looks bad but the momentum to get up did look as if it was aggressive. I hugged him, Moz laughed and i was headlocked. End of story. I have nothing but love for El Jefe!,\" Rodriguez wrote.\n\nAccording to the San Diego Union-Tribune, police in the area had no record of any calls coming from the Symphony Hall Saturday night.

In every warring country, they gave their lives.\n\nMany of their jobs involved danger and caused death. In Britain, women worked in factories, including in the production of weapons \u2014 a key role, given that the side that could produce the most weapons in the war of attrition would ultimately win.\n\nBy 1917, munitions sites, which mostly employed women workers, produced 80 percent of the weapons and shells used by the British Army, according to historian A. V. M. Airth-Kindree.\n\nShe said some female workers in Britain were known as \"canaries\" because they had to handle TNT, which caused their skin to turn yellow.\n\nAround 400 women in Britain died from overexposure to TNT during WWI, according to estimates.\n\nAmong the Allies, organizations such as the Red Cross depended on thousands of female volunteers.\n\nBy June 1918, there were over 3,000 American nurses in over 750 in hospitals in France, as many more served in the Nurse Corps in the US army and naval.\n\nAs nurses, it was common for them to be sent to the front line and witness its horror first hand. One solemn reminder of that lies in the headstones of the Cromwell twins at the Suresnes American Cemetery that US President Donald Trump visited Sunday.\n\nThe two were beloved American nurses who worked tirelessly for the Red Cross in France. They survived the war only to commit suicide in 1919, it's believed, due to the trauma.\n\nWhile most countries banned women from fighting, Russia was the sole country to allow them in combat, from 1917.\n\nOne female combatant, Maria Bochkareva, founded Russia's \"Women's Battalion of Death,\" recovered from injuries and became a decorated commander.\n\nDespite the inequities, the war period was a key moment in the women's movement as it marked the first time on a wide scale that women realized their roles could be beyond domestic.\n\nDuring Sunday's ceremony, a letter written by Denise Bruller to her soldier fianc\u00e9 Pierre Fort was read out, speaking of her emotion and anguish at the end of the war that caused \"upheaval to the very depths of my being.\"\n\nLove and emotion were very much part of the war \u2014 and its propaganda \u2014 and such stories help color the narrative of loss.

It is my duty and the responsibility to ... create the situation for the 15 million voters in this country takes the ultimate decision by choosing their members to the Parliament through a free and fair election.\"\n\nThe crisis began Oct. 26 when Sirisena sacked Ranil Wickremesinghe as prime minister and appointed former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa in his place.\n\nWickremesinghe said his sacking was unconstitutional as he still enjoyed a majority in Parliament and still occupies the official residence.\n\nSirisena also suspended Parliament originally until Nov. 16, delaying the possibility of testing the majority.\n\nAmid mounting local and international pressure, he announced that he will reconvene parliament Nov. 14 and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said he was going to call for a vote on that day itself to see whether Rajapaksa, commanded enough support.\n\nSirisena dissolved Parliament after his attempts to secure the backing of 113 members in the 225-member Parliament failed. He has called for elections on Jan.5.\n\nSirisena and Wickremesinghe, who were leading traditionally opposed parties, were part of an awkward coalition government until Wickremesinghe's sacking Oct. 26.\n\nAlso on Sunday Rajapaksa left his longtime political party and joined another, in a move that could weaken Sirisena.\n\nRajapaksa joined the Sri Lanka People's Front, a party of which he was shadow leader for months. His move could weaken Sirisena's Sri Lanka Freedom Party, of which Rajapaksa had been a longtime member.

The trend continues with registered independents as 53 percent like them a lot in 2018 compared to 49 percent in 2009.

Alex and I have worked well trying to create a stable environment for our daughters and there has never been an issue. Until now.\u201d\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time a headstrong Lopez, who has been divorced three times, has taken the reins in a relationship. In the early aughts, she plucked her backup dancer Cris Judd from anonymity and thrust him into the spotlight during a 16-month marriage. And then there was her infamous two-year relationship with Ben Affleck (2002 to 2004), during which the flashy Lopez transformed the low-key movie star into a tanned, pomaded piece of arm candy who was ridiculed endlessly in the press.\n\nCynthia, 45, who has always used Rodriguez as her surname after the 2008 divorce from Alex, got engaged to a Florida businessman involved in real estate and the fitness industry four years ago.\n\nShe and her fianc\u00e9 \u2014 who she declined to name \u2014 welcomed a daughter two years later.\n\n\u201cEverybody got along,\u201d Cynthia said of the relationship between her fianc\u00e9 and A-Rod early on. \u201cEverything was fine. This is all new.\u201d\n\nLopez\u2019s intrusion isn\u2019t unheard of, according to legal experts who said it\u2019s not unusual for a significant other to make an appearance at a mediation, especially if the mediator thinks the parties might reach a resolution more quickly.\n\nBut no such tidy ending took place with J.Lo in the room. Cynthia attended the proceeding alone, according to sources.\n\nRon Berkowitz, Alex Rodriguez\u2019s spokesman, said he had \u201cno idea\u201d if Lopez was present at the mediation, and declined further comment. Lopez\u2019s representative declined comment. Alan Kluger, an attorney for A-Rod, did not return a call.\n\nIn the midst of J-Rod allegedly trying to skimp on child support, the duo have been blatantly showcasing their decadent lives on social media. Earlier this week, Lopez, who is worth an estimated $380 million, Instagrammed pics from a trip with Rodriguez, with one showing her posing in a private jet decked out in Chanel and Hermes. In August, she documented their luxe vacation in Capri, and in May, Rodriguez posted a pic from the Met Gala of him and Lopez hobnobbing with the Kardashians.\n\nThere are also countless images of Lopez and Rodriguez\u2019s families personifying blended family bliss.\n\nOn Father\u2019s Day, Lopez, who shares twins Emme and Max with ex-hubby, singer Marc Anthony, posted a video of her beau opening his gifts with the caption: \u201cHappy Fathers Day to the most loving daddy to Tashi and Ella!! And thank you my love for being so beautifully loving to Emme and Max \u2026 We are all so lucky to have you in our lives.\u201d\n\nBut Cynthia is feeling anything but lucky right now.\n\nTMZ reported A-Rod, 43, currently pays $115,000 a month in child support \u2014 a figure that Cynthia\u2019s attorney, Maurice Kutner, said is \u201cgrossly inaccurate.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kutner, there have been no filings in Cynthia and A-Rod\u2019s divorce case since 2009 when a final judgment was rendered. All the terms of the divorce settlement are confidential.\n\nIn April, Alex Rodriguez claimed he wasn\u2019t trying to reduce his child-support obligations, contradicting the TMZ report, which stated Alex Rodriguez feels as if \u201che\u2019s bankrolling\u201d Cynthia, her fianc\u00e9 and the couple\u2019s new baby girl.\n\n\u201cAlex always supported the relationship and was appreciative that our children were being exposed to a person of his caliber,\u201d said Cynthia, referring to her fianc\u00e9 and his relationship with Natasha, 13, and Ella, 10. \u201cAll was well until recently.\u201d\n\nCynthia says her fianc\u00e9 is anything but a freeloader, having started a company called Quality Fitness and also working in real estate. She adds that in the 10 years after her divorce from A-Rod, she\u2019s \u201cnever discussed\u201d publicly any of the terms of their divorce settlement or custody arrangement. She and Kutner both said there have been no issues that weren\u2019t resolved by a phone call between Cynthia, Kutner and A-Rod\u2019s attorney, and that even then, those calls were \u201cinfrequent\u201d over the last decade. Cynthia was miffed when the TMZ story appeared and aired what she considers confidential information.\n\n\u201cAfter 10 years of flawlessness, this situation is unsettling,\u201d Cynthia said.\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure \u2014 when Rodriguez plays, he plays to win.\n\nDuring a Sept. 24 speech at the Midtown Manhattan Hilton where he was an honoree at the \u201cGreat Sports Legends\u201d gala for the Buoniconti Fund and Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, Rodriguez gushed about Lopez, who was on his arm that night. \u201cI\u2019ve been blessed to have my mother and Jennifer as my inspiration daily. Our philosophy is, when in doubt, attack,\u201d A-Rod said.\n\nDuring the Biogenesis doping scandal in 2013 \u2014 which ultimately resulted in a season-long (2014) ban from playing \u2014 A-Rod took his philosophy, and the advice of another strong woman, to heart. A published report said that it was Desiree Perez, a key player in Jay-Z\u2019s Roc Nation empire, who steered Rodriguez toward his unsuccessful scorched-earth policy of fighting Major League Baseball and launching lawsuits against MLB, the players\u2019 union and a Yankee team doctor.\n\nMeanwhile, matters between Cynthia and A-Rod have been complicated by Cynthia\u2019s younger brother\u2019s legal war with Alex.\n\nConstantine Scurtis filed a multi-million dollar civil suit in Miami state court against Alex Rodriguez in late 2014, alleging, among multiple claims, that A-Rod bilked Scurtis out of millions of dollars in the real estate venture they started together in 2003. Scurtis claims he was forced out of the company, ACREI L.L.C., in 2008, the same year Cynthia and Alex divorced. The case is churning ahead despite A-Rod\u2019s unsuccessful attempts to have it dismissed.\n\n\u201cOf course [the lawsuit] is a sore subject,\u201d said Cynthia. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of my ex-husband, who I still care for very much, and my baby brother, who I love. It\u2019s a difficult spot for me to be in. But I\u2019m not sure if the lawsuit is the real motivation for what Alex is doing now.\u201d\n\nJ-Lo\u2019s name surfaced in at least one court document pertaining to the Scurtis lawsuit. In an April 30 motion filed in the case, Cynthia is accused of making \u201cdisparaging remarks\u201d toward Lopez. Cynthia calls those allegations \u201csimply not true.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a celebrity, nor do I care to be one,\u201d said Cynthia. \u201cI lead a conventional life. I\u2019m a mom.

He was also a Yankees team adviser in 2017 and in 2018.\n\nThe Post has learned that the Yankees have not yet discussed whether or not Rodriguez will return as a team adviser in 2019, although Yankees managing general partner Hal Steinbrenner has been praiseworthy of Rodriguez\u2019s contributions.\n\nClearly, he\u2019s not wanting for cash. Last February, the Wall Street Journal reported that J-Lo and Rodriguez purchased a $15.3 million apartment at 432 Park Ave, the world\u2019s largest residential tower.\n\nDespite his jet-setting ways, the TMZ report said Rodriguez makes far less now than he did during his Yankee-playing days.\n\nWhile Cynthia\u2019s divorce settlement is confidential, she hasn\u2019t been sitting around waiting for her ex\u2019s money to flow in as the TMZ article implies.

It was raining and very muddy,\" he said. It's raining today 100 years later.\"\n\nKearsey and his wife traveled to Europe to tour World War I battlefields \"to honor the lost.\"\n\nOfficial commemorations held to mark the 100th anniversary of the agreement between the Allies and a defeated Germany that silenced guns on the Western Front have provided an opportunity to contemplate the implications of the first war of its kind.\n\nBut for the children and grandchildren of soldiers who were injured or killed in more than four years of brutal fighting, the centennial offered a moment to reflect on the enduring toll of decisions made by world leaders very much like the presidents, prime ministers and kings also standing in the rain.\n\nIn central London, thousands of people marched in a \"people's procession\" to honor fallen soldiers. Descendants of many veterans attended the march , which was described as an expression of gratitude for those who fought in WWI and other conflicts.\n\nParticipants passed central London's Cenotaph war monument, where senior members of Britain's royal family and national leaders had placed wreaths earlier in the day.\n\nAmong them were Marion Lewis and Dorothy Heslop, sisters who said they wanted to honor their grandfather. Pvt. John Waters who suffered a severe head wound during World War I while fighting in France.\n\n\"They did not expect him to survive, so they left him outside the medical tent and we think it's the cold that probably saved him,\" Heslop told Britain's Press Association.\n\nGrowing up, they said, it was an unspoken rule not to ask granddad about the war.\n\nOliver Davies was a 21-year-old driver for the Royal Engineers when he was hit by a stray bullet while taking animals to water near Jerusalem in 1917. His family still has the letter from Davies' captain informing his mother of his death.\n\nHis great-grandniece, Jackie Sheridan, attended the London march.\n\n\"It's a very proud moment to represent my family who are descendants,\" Sheridan said. \"It's going to be emotional to see everybody here, knowing there's 10,000 of us.\"\n\nAs for William Kearsey of Australia's 33rd Battalion, he survived the trench in Belgium hit by enemy fire because of a friend who dragged him out. But coming home with severe damage from the first war to use industrial-era war equipment like machine guns, Kearsey faced a new hell.\n\nHis injuries included lost sinuses and tear ducts. But years of surgery in Britain and South Wales gave the veteran another chance at life, Peter Kearsey said of his father, who died in 1971.\n\n\"He was a kind, gentle man. He suffered a lot right up till his death,\" the son recalled.\n\nSome 62,000 Australians died on the battlefields of the Great War, and 150,000 were injured, according to Kerry Neale of the Australian War Memorial.

Whitaker has argued that cutting Mueller\u2019s budget would be a way to end the probe, that investigating President Trump\u2019s finances would be a \u201cred line\u201d and that he believes there was \"no collusion\" between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\n\"The appointment of Mr. Whitaker should concern every American \u2013 Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative \u2013 who believes in rule of law and justice,\" Schumer said.\" \"He has already prejudged the Mueller situation.

There's no reason we shouldn't add this and avoid a constitutional crisis,\" Schumer said. \"We'll see what happens down the road.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith the pushback from top Democrats, numerous Republican lawmakers have come to Whitaker's defense. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Whitaker was \"appointed legally\" and there was no reason for him to recuse himself from the Mueller investigation.\n\n\"You don't recuse somebody because they have opinions different than the people they're overseeing,\" Graham said Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"The bottom line here is Mueller will be allowed to do the job without political interference by Mr. Whitaker.\"\n\nRep.

The President's dismissal of Attorney General Sessions and his appointment of Whitaker, who's a complete political lackey, is a real threat to the integrity of that investigation,\" he said, adding that the investigation is \"of utmost importance.\"", "Florida Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott on Sunday directly accused his Democratic opponent, incumbent Sen.

They didn\u2019t report on time. ... We still don\u2019t understand how they went in these two counties and dramatically increased \u2013 another 93,000 votes were cast, or somehow they came up with 93,000 votes after election night.\"\n\nScott confirmed to Wallace that state law enforcement is looking into the matter.\n\n\"I\u2019ve asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to go in and do an investigation to find out what happened here,\" Scott said. \"But we clearly know, the judges have already said, they clearly violated the law.\"\n\nOn Friday, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) announced that it was not investigating Florida election officials because it had not found credible allegations of fraud.\n\n\"Sen. Nelson is clearly trying to commit fraud to win this election, that\u2019s all this is,\" Scott told Wallace. Asked to elaborate on his accusation, Scott replied, \"Well, it's his team.\"\n\nHe explained: \"His lawyers said that a noncitizen should vote, that\u2019s one.

According to the draft transcript of the meeting, taken by a court reporter hired by the Florida Republican Party, a provisional ballot was ordered excluded from the count, as it came from a non-U.S. citizen.\n\nThe Nelson campaign distanced itself from the objections, which it said that it had not authorized.\n\n\u201cThe lawyer who was present was not someone we had authorized to make such an objection. Noncitizens cannot vote in U.S. elections,\" Marc Elias, recount attorney for the Nelson campaign, said in a statement. The Gillum campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA Nelson spokesperson tersely dismissed Scott's legal efforts on Thursday: \u201cThe goal here is to see that all the votes in Florida are counted and counted accurately. Rick Scott\u2019s action appears to be politically motivated and borne out of desperation.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd Nelson and Florida Democrats filed their own lawsuit this weekend, asserting that the state's process for rejecting provisional and mail-in ballots \"based on signature mismatch is done without any consistent standard or relevant expertise.\"\n\nSnipes, the Broward County election superviser who has held her office since 2003, is no stranger to controversy. Earlier this year, Scott's administration said it was monitoring her office after a judge ruled in May the county broke federal law by destroying ballots in Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz's 2016 Democratic primary race against Tim Canova, Politico reported.\n\nSnipes claimed the issue had been \"blown out of proportion.\"\n\nIn August, a judge sided with the Florida GOP in its challenge of how the county handled absentee ballots. Republicans claimed Snipes' office was opening ballots in private, preventing people from challenging if they were properly cast, according to Politico.\n\nAnd then in 2016, Broward County violated the law when it posted early voting results online before polls even closed, the Miami Herald reported.\n\nThe error was made by a young employee of an outside company hired by the county to tally the election results and a lawsuit against Snipes' office over the incident was \"unsuccessful,\" according to the Miami Herald. Snipes also won a lawsuit that same year after being challenged for leaving off an amendment regarding medical marijuana on some mail-in ballots.\n\nIn 2004, her office had to scramble to send out new absentee ballots after it said some 58,000 voters did not receive them despite requesting them, the Sun-Sentinel reported at the time.\n\nBONGINO BLASTS FLORIDA ELECTION OFFICIAL: 'SHE HAD ONE JOB'\n\nBroward is not the only county in Scott's legal crosshairs. In a parallel suit against Palm Beach County, Scott and the NRSC charge that the election supervisor there illegally used her own judgment to determine voter intent when reviewing damaged or incorrectly filled-out absentee ballots, while refusing to allow impartial witnesses to monitor the process.\n\nScott's complaint against Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher alleges first that officials there illegally refused to allow Republicans, or any witnesses, to monitor the county's handling of damaged absentee ballots.\n\nAt the end of the process, Scott said he is confident he will prevail.\n\n\"I haven\u2019t decided where I\u2019m going to be this week,\" Scott said, when asked whether he would attend a planned GOP photo-op for incoming senators. \"We are going to watch this machine recount process, so I figure that out in the next few days.

When Bongo's father died in 2009 after more than four decades in power, Gabonese officials angrily denied French media reports of his death for almost a day, and shut down the internet in the country for several hours.\n\nThe statement said that Ali Bongo was suffering dizziness at his hotel in Riyad, Saudi Arabia on Oct. 24 when he sought medical care at King Faysal Hospital.\n\nThe information about the president's health is \"extremely reassuring\" and the president \"continues to perform his duties,\" the presidency said.\n\nThe communique came amid a swirl of rumors over the president's health back home in the Central African nation.

A Myanmar government statement said an initial group of 2,251 would be sent back from mid-November at a rate of 150 per day.\n\nNoting that the actual date depended upon Bangladesh taking action, Win Myat Aye said, \"Whether it will happen on the day or not, we have to be ready on our side and we try our best to do that.\"\n\nThe Rohingya exodus began after Myanmar security forces launched a brutal crackdown following coordinated insurgent attacks in August 2017. The scale, organization and ferocity of the operation led to accusations from the international community, including the United Nations, of ethnic cleansing and genocide.

It said China, India and Japan were \"providing necessary assistance\" for the repatriation process, but did not give details.\n\nIt isn't clear how long the returnees would have to stay in the transit camps or where they would go afterward, as many Rohingya villages have been erased by bulldozers, with the land given to local Rakhine Buddhists.\n\nOfficials said Sunday that returnees can get an ID document called a National Verification Card that will allow them to travel anywhere in the Maungdaw area of Rakhine State. They can then begin to apply for citizenship.\n\nBut there is widespread skepticism that any returning refugees will ever be granted citizenship.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of people in Myanmar do not accept that the Rohingya are a native ethnic group, instead seeing them as illegal migrants from Bangladesh and calling them \"Bengalis.\"\n\nIn remarks delivered last month at the United Nations, Yanghee Lee said the Rohingya \"should not go back to ... the oppressive laws, the discrimination. The minimum they need is freedom of movement, access to basic health services.\"\n\n\"Right now, it's like an apartheid situation where Rohingyas still living in Myanmar ... have no freedom of movement,\" Lee said. \"The camps, the shelters, the model villages that are being built, it's more of a cementing of total segregation or separation from the Rakhine ethnic community.\"", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nThe Latest on events marking the centennial of Poland's independence (all times local):\n\n3:10 p.m.\n\nPoland's president has addressed thousands of people ahead of an Independence Day march in Warsaw that has for the first time been jointly organized by state officials and nationalist organizations.\n\nMost of the people in the crowd held the national white-and-red flag.

This is a classic phishing scam where victims are prompted for information such as usernames, passwords, one-time passcodes and PIN numbers.\n\nThe bank contacted the FBI after losing $68,000 from 17 ATMs in Illinois, Michigan and Ohio, according to WCPO.\n\nIn one case, a man made 19 withdrawals totaling more than $9,000. The same man allegedly made other withdrawals. He had a total of $14,000 in cash at the time of his arrest.\n\nUltimately, the scam succeeded in stealing personal information from over 120 customers and losses at Fifth Third Bank totaled $106,000, according to court records cited in the WCPO report.\n\nOn November 7, a grand jury indicted four men who participated in the cardless ATM scheme, WCPO said.\n\nThough many customers have likely never heard of cardless ATM transactions, that could change as it becomes more popular, giving criminals new opportunities. In January 2017, a California woman lost $3,000 via a cardless ATM operated by Chase Bank, KrebsOnSecurity added.\n\n\u201cIn that incident, the thieves didn\u2019t even need to know her ATM PIN,\u201d KrebsOnSecurity wrote. They were able to use the phone number and mobile device they controlled and associate it with the woman\u2019s Chase account using her username and password.\n\nCHINA, NOT RUSSIA, IS THE MASSIVE THREAT TO WATCH\n\n\u201cThis time last year, cardless ATMs were offered mainly by the big banks, and then only at some of their ATMs. Now, many smaller regional and local banks have upgraded their cash machines to enable the new technology,\u201d KrebsOnSecurity added in the post.\n\nThe internet security website cites a Mastercard poll that claims 78 percent of consumers when asked, would rather use a cardless ATM than carry a physical card.", "An Australian woman was arrested over the weekend after a two-month investigation into needles hidden in strawberries that sparked contamination fears in the region.\n\nThe 50-year-old woman was charged Sunday with seven counts of contaminating goods, Queensland police said. The charges stem from one of the first cases of sewing needles found in strawberries by the fruit company Berry Licious.\n\n\u201cThe Queensland Police Service has arrested a 50-year-old woman following a complex investigation into the alleged contamination of strawberries in Queensland in September,\u201d police said in a statement. \u201cAfter the discovery of punnets of strawberries contaminated with needles, Queensland authorities notified the public of the safety risk on September 12.\u201d\n\nMAN REPORTEDLY EATS STRAWBERRY WITH NEEDLE INSIDE, POLICE CONFIRM 4 \u2018CONTAMINATION\u2019 INCIDENTS\n\nResidents in Australia were urged to cut up their strawberries after several consumers reported finding sewing needles in the fruit. A man, Hoani Hearne, was hospitalized in September after swallowing half a needle hidden in a strawberry.\n\n\"I bit into it, felt it break, my knee-jerk reaction was to swallow, and what was left over was half of a sewing needle,\" Hearne told Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).\n\nMore than 100 cases of contaminated strawberries were reported in Australia, as well as one incident in New Zealand, ABC reported.\n\nThe incidents, which affected several fruit suppliers in the country, sparked fears among consumers and a drop in strawberry prices, Reuters reported. Queensland police also offered a $70,000 reward in September for information leading to an arrest.", "The caravan of several thousand Central American migrants resumed their march Saturday toward the U.S. border, departing Mexico's capital city on a trek north to where troops have been deployed by President Trump to stop them.\n\nThe caravan, which now is made up of about 4,000 migrants, had been in Mexico City for the past four days resting before resuming their journey to the central Mexican city of Queretaro. The group began their trek by taking the city's metro system to the outskirts before walking and hitching rides along a main highway.\n\nWhen the group arrived in Queretaro, they were met by volunteers offering them tortillas, sandwiches and rice, according to the Associated Press. Local officials had prepared a stadium for the group's arrival, and the migrants strung up tarps and tents to spend the night.\n\n\"I decided to come (with the caravan) to help my family,\" Maria Yesenia Perez, who left La Ceiba, Honduras, nearly a month ago with her 8-year-old daughter, told the AP.\n\nSome of the original group has split and is expected to arrive in the border city of Tijuana on Monday, according to Reuters, while others later in the week are expected to reach Reynosa and other border towns.\n\nMIGRANT CARAVAN GETS WITHIN REACH OF BORDER: WHAT HAPPENS NOW?\n\nThose reaching the border will have a tougher time applying for asylum if they choose to cross into the U.S. illegally. On Thursday, the White House announced that migrants will not be allowed to enter the U.S. illegally to file asylum claims, which is how the vast majority of roughly 150,000 Central American families and children entered the U.S. last fiscal year.\n\nInstead, they will be required to enter through official ports of entry, like those near San Diego, Yuma and El Paso. By issuing the new directive, Trump is in essence creating a bottleneck by funneling tens of thousands of illegal immigrants to already overcrowded ports.\n\nBut that's not deterring those still in the caravan.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what rules (Trump\u2019s) government imposes, we cannot go back to our countries. I have a bullet in my arm and another in my shoulder.

Some left the capital with bottles of water and clear plastic bags of bananas and oranges for the long trek.\n\nOthers were given juice and ham sandwiches from volunteers as they set out.\n\nMaria Yesenia Perez, a 41-year-old who left La Ceiba, Honduras nearly a month ago with her 8-year-old daughter, told the AP she was prepared to wait to gain entry at the U.S. border.\n\n\"I decided to come (with the caravan) to help my family,\" she said, before she and her daughter were hoisted onto the back of a semitrailer.\n\nThe caravan became a campaign issue in U.S. midterm elections and President Trump has ordered the deployment of more than 5,000 military troops to the border to fend off the migrants.\n\nMany in the caravan say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, and they have now been on the road for weeks.\n\nFox News' William La Jeunesse and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nIsrael's prime minister on Sunday defended his decision to allow the transfer of $15 million from Qatar to Gaza's Hamas rulers, rejecting criticism that the move had strengthened the Islamic militant group.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu told reporters that it was \"the right step\" at the moment, and that he was committed to restoring quiet along the Israel-Gaza frontier and preventing a humanitarian crisis in the coastal Palestinian territory.\n\n\"Every action, without exception, has a price,\" he said. \"If you can't handle the price you cannot lead. And I can handle the price.\"\n\nIsraeli critics, including members of his hard-line coalition, accused Netanyahu of capitulating to violence and of granting relief to the embattled Hamas group.\n\nThe internationally backed Palestinian president, whose forces lost control of Gaza to Hamas in 2007, angrily accused the U.S. and Israel of being involved in a \"conspiracy\" to permanently sever Gaza from the West Bank. He promised to take unspecified measures against his Hamas rivals in the coming days.\n\nHamas leaders in Gaza have described the arrival of the $15 million, delivered last week in three suitcases by a Qatari diplomat, as their first major gain of more than seven months of weekly protests along the perimeter fence.\n\nHamas has been leading the protests since March 30 in a bid to ease a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade that was imposed in 2007 in order to weaken the militant group. The blockade has led to over 50 percent unemployment and chronic power outages, and prevents most Gazans from being able to leave the tiny territory.\n\nOver 160 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the border protests, in which Palestinians throw rocks, burning tires and grenades toward Israeli troops.\n\nIsrael says it is defending its border against militant infiltrations, but its army has come under international criticism because of the large number of unarmed protesters who have been shot.\n\nWith Hamas threatening to intensify the protests and international officials warning of a looming humanitarian crisis, Netanyahu on Thursday allowed the cash into Gaza. It is the first installment of $90 million that Qatar has pledged to cover the salaries of thousands of unpaid Hamas employees for six months.\n\nIsraeli opposition figures lambasted Netanyahu for appearing to cave in to violence. Army Radio played decade-old sound clips of Netanyahu, from when he was the opposition leader, threatening tough action against Hamas and criticizing his predecessor for being too soft.\n\nEven his erstwhile allies attacked him for indirectly doing business with a militant group that has fought three wars against Israel and is sworn to Israel's destruction.\n\n\"Everyone knows where that money is going to go ultimately,\" said Netanyahu's agriculture minister, Uri Ariel.\n\nBut in comments to reporters before traveling to Paris, Netanyahu said it was a \"question of alternatives.\" He said the step was coordinated with security officials to restore quiet for Israeli citizens living near the Gaza border and to avert a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe payment is part of what is expected to be a set of informal understandings between Israel and Hamas reached through Egyptian and U.N. mediation.\n\nHamas is demanding an expansion of the permissible fishing zone off the Israeli-controlled Gaza coast, uninterrupted flow of fuel to mitigate chronic power shortages and the lifting of Israeli restrictions on exports and imports. In return, Israel wants quiet and an end to the border protests.\n\nFor the second week in a row, the Palestinians kept Friday's protests carefully restrained, burning fewer tires and refraining from breaching the fence.\n\nIn the West Bank, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas angrily accused Israel and the U.S. of ganging up behind his back to entrench Hamas' control over Gaza. He also accused Hamas of undermining his goal of establishing an independent Palestinian state that includes all of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\n\nAbbas fears that the U.S. is preparing to float a peace plan, called the \"Deal of the Century\" by President Donald Trump, that would leave Hamas in control of Gaza and give him only limited autonomy in pieces of the West Bank.\n\n\"We are going to take tough measures (against Hamas) in the coming days,\" Abbas said.\n\n\"There is an American conspiracy, which is the 'Deal of the Century,' and there is an Israeli conspiracy to implement the 'Deal of the Century,'\" he said. \"To my dismay, there is another conspiracy from Hamas to foil the independent state.\"\n\nAbbas, speaking at a ceremony marking the 14th anniversary of the death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, did not elaborate on what steps he might take against Hamas.\n\nAbbas has repeatedly limited financial aid to Gaza in order to pressure Hamas into returning control to him.\n\nIn the West Bank, meanwhile, hundreds of Palestinians attended the funeral of Mohammed Shreteh, a 27-year-old Palestinian who died of head wounds after being shot in clashes with Israeli troops two weeks ago.\n\n___\n\nDaraghmeh reported from Ramallah, West Bank.", "An 11-year-old Arizona girl thwarted a possible kidnapping last week after she demanded a stranger who told her to get into a white SUV to give her a \u201ccode word.\u201d\n\nThe unidentified girl and a friend were walking near a park in North Pecan Creek just before 4 p.m. Wednesday when a man driving a white SUV, described as a Ford Explorer-like vehicle, pulled up next to them, Pinal County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement.\n\nThe man claimed the girl\u2019s brothers were in a serious accident and told the girl she had to come with him, police said.

Bells tolled across Europe's Western Front and fighter jets passed overhead to mark the exact moment the devastating war came to a close.\n\nTrump and first lady Melania Trump traveled separately from most of the other presidents and dignitaries attending the event, who had gathered earlier at the Elysee Palace and traveled to the ceremony by bus. And Trump was not present as the other leaders arrived, walking side-by-side in a somber, rain-soaked line holding black umbrellas as bells finished tolling. They had arrived a few minutes late, missing the exact moment \u2014 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918 \u2014 that four years of fighting ended.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited security protocols for the presidential motorcade's solo trip down the grand Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, which was closed to traffic. But at least one topless woman breached tight security, running into the street and shouting \"fake peace maker\" as the cars passed. She had slogans, included the words \"Fake\" and \"Peace,\" written on her chest.\n\nPolice tackled the women and the motorcade continued uninterrupted. The feminist activist group Femen later claimed responsibility.\n\nThe ceremony included a speech by French President Emmanuel Macron aimed directly at the rising tide of populism in the United States and Europe.\n\nWith Trump and other leaders looking on, Macron warned against the dangers of nationalism and said the \"ancient demons\" that caused World War I and millions of deaths are growing stronger.\n\n\"Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism: Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\" he said, adding that, when nations put their interests first and decide \"who cares about the others\" they \"erase the most precious thing a nation can have... Its moral values.\"\n\nTrump, who has proudly declared himself a nationalist, sat mostly stone-faced as he listened to Macron, who sees himself as Europe's foil to the rising sentiment, which has taken hold in Hungary and Poland among other countries.\n\nSitting several seats away was Russian President Vladimir Putin, who greeted Trump when he arrived, shaking Trump's hand, flashing him a thumbs-up sign and patted Trump's arm. Trump had been expected to meet with Putin during the visit, but will instead sit down with him formally later this month at a world leaders' summit in Buenos Aires. The two could wind up chatting at a lunch Macron was hosting for world leaders following Sunday's ceremony.\n\nFrance was the epicenter of the first global conflict. Its role as host of the main international commemoration highlighted the point that the world mustn't stumble into war again, as it did so quickly and catastrophically with World War II.\n\nTrump later Sunday will be paying a visit to the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in the suburbs of Paris, where he will deliver Veterans Day remarks before returning to Washington. More than 1,500 Americans who died during the war are buried there.\n\nTrump has been criticized for failing to visit a different American cemetery about 60 miles (100 kilometers) outside of Paris Saturday.

He criticizes the world's acquiescence to Syrian president Bashar al Assad's repeated use of chemical weapons against his own people.\n\n\"I cannot imagine what that would do to somebody who is hiding in their basement, with their children, waiting for a chemical weapon to rain down and suffocate them,\" says Rifai.\n\nWORLD WAR I POSTERS OFFER UNIQUE GLIMPSE INTO SOLDIERS' STORIES 100 YEARS AFTER THE ARMISTICE\n\n\"I don't understand how a human being can use a chemical weapon against anyone else.\"\n\nIt is a lesson not learned since 1918.\n\n\"Countries have still been able to get away with it, even though we know what they do,\" notes Dr. Timothy Westcott, professor of history at Park University in Parkville, Missouri.

It's awful.\"\n\nTHIS BULLET-SCARRED BIBLE \u2018SAVED THE LIFE\u2019 OF A WORLD WAR I SOLDIER\n\nThe Germans first used poison gas, chlorine, against the British in 1915 to try and break the long stalemate on the Western front. Even though their use constituted a war crime, first outlawed in 1899, that did not stop their use, eventually, by both sides.\n\n\"White phosphorus was a powerful one, some people would have seen kind of like a cloud that just eats the skin away, very quickly,\" says Dr. Westcott. \"Mustard gas is probably what most people have some familiarity with. Mustard gas, inhaling that, eats your insides outward, and is very painful. A lot of these were very painful. The gas mask that was invented very quickly to deal with them was somewhat successful, but not always, particularly if there was not enough warning of a gas attack.\"\n\n\"Mustard gas was really an oil that would sit on things, especially your skin, it was a vesicant, it was a blistering agent,\" explains Johnathan Casey, the director of archives at the Edward Jones Research Center at the National World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nAMERICA'S DEADLIEST BATTLE: WORLD WAR I'S MEUSE-ARGONNE OFFENSIVE 100 YEARS LATER\n\n\"There was a convention prohibiting these gases that had been signed by a number of the European countries but they were able to circumvent that by saying the definition of the weapons that they were using did not fit the convention.\"\n\nAs part of its collection, the Museum displays the rudimentary gas masks and grenades that were used during the war.\n\n\"People would start to choke on it and the body would react to get this poison or irritant out of the body,\" Casey says. \"It was quite a shock and caused a lot of panic among the soldiers, because there was something all of a sudden there that they had not experienced before, or had any training or defense against and from that there was a natural outrage.\"\n\nAfter the war ended, the 1919 Versailles Treaty banned the use of chemical weapons. In 1925 another agreement, the Geneva \"Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare\" went into effect.\n\nINCREDIBLE WORLD WAR I DIARY SURFACES\n\nCurrently, 193 nations have adopted the United Nations\u2019 \"Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons\" that was enacted in 1997.\n\n\"We have international agreements that these are not to be used on human beings. Unfortunately, we have not enforced those,\" laments Dr. Westcott.\n\nAt the United Nations, there has been harsh condemnation of the continued use of chemical weapons. Saddam Hussein deployed poison gas to massacre 5,000 Kurds in 1988 and repeated attacks have not completely stopped in Syria. Russia is also suspected of having used a deadly chemical nerve agent, Novichok, in the U.K. earlier this year.\n\nAt a U.N. Security Council meeting in September, British Ambassador Karen Pierce was blunt.\n\n100-YEAR OLD LETTER FROM WWI UNCOVERED\n\n\"I just find it unconscionable \u2026 that after all these years, in the hundredth anniversary year of the end of the first World War, that any government can even think of using chemical weapons against its own people or indeed against anyone else, whether they\u2019re a small city in Britain or they are a country like Syria,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Westcott, sadly, does not foresee a day when chemical weapons will no longer be used. He is calling on governments to step up enforcement of sanctions against those who violate the international agreements.\n\n\"There are humans in charge of them. There's humans in charge of the countries, and I think unfortunately as humans, we have to do our best to control however we define that as a global society, to control those.

You might as well believe that someone, somewhere, is working around the clock to break into your accounts and steal your money, your identity, and anything else you have. Because it\u2019s essentially true.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve taken precautions. You use security software. If you don\u2019t, tap or click here for three free downloads for optimum Windows security.\n\nYou have set up your router\u2019s security so hackers cannot access every device on your network, get your passwords, or use your systems as a bot in their attacks. To be sure, tap or click here for five router security settings to turn on before it\u2019s too late.\n\nAfter you do that, you\u2019re far from done. Hackers are smart and always on the move.\n\nHere are five simple solutions for you to protect your business, your nest egg, and your future.\n\n1. Don\u2019t make these common mistakes with passwords\n\nIt may seem obvious that you need a strong to keep hackers from accessing your private information and financial reports. Millions of people are sitting ducks because of insecure passwords like 12345678 or Password. They also use the same password for multiple sites.\n\nThe ground rules for passwords are 1. It has to contain a random collection of letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers and symbols; 2. It has to be eight characters or longer; and 3. You have to create a unique password for every account.\n\nThat\u2019s a tall order. While something like \u201cTl|_|,BwwB2R\u201d is really strong, it isn\u2019t easy to remember. Or is it? Let me show you how I came up with it.\n\nStart by thinking up a random sentence. You can use a catchphrase, quote or even a song lyric. I chose a lyric from a Bruce Springsteen song: \u201cTramps like us, baby we were born to run.\u201d\n\nI took the first character from each word to get \u201ctlu,bwwbtr\u201d. Not bad, but it could be better. So, I added some symbols in place of similar letters. U becomes |_|, the \u201cto\u201d from the original lyric becomes 2. Then, I capitalized a few of the letters to make a strong password that I can easily remember: \u201cTl|_|,BwwB2R\u201d.\n\nOnce you have that you can tweak the same password for multiple accounts. For Facebook, you could make it \u201cTl|_|$,BwwB2RFB.\u201d Amazon can be \u201cAmzTl|_|$,BwwB2R.\u201d You can make a consistent scheme.\n\n2. Make it harder for hackers to crack the code\n\nHackers can quickly figure out your password, but they can\u2019t figure out the secret, one-time code that your bank texts to you. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a powerful security method because hackers would have to physically steal your phone, enter the correct password, and then enter that secret code.\n\nIn the wake of large-scale hacks, most major accounts offer two-factor authentication, from social media to banks.\n\nIf you're not sure how to set up 2FA on your accounts, I have your back. Tap or click here for the steps to get it done on your most popular accounts targeted by hackers.\n\n3. Keep track of all your pennies\n\nMost of us have at least one bank account (and often more) plus credit accounts, Paypal, and other depositories for our money. These can be hard to keep track of, especially when you have additional investments and personal savings goals.\n\nIt\u2019s easier to keep track of your business finances if all these accounts are in aggregated in one place, right in front of your eyes.\n\nThese days that means an app like Intuit\u2019s Mint. The Mint app, and others like it, can help you set budgets and manage your bills. You can also get reminders to pay bills when they\u2019re due.\n\n4. Know your credit score\n\nYour credit score will tell you a lot about hackers. If you see anything suspicious on them, like credit card accounts that you didn\u2019t open, you can alert whichever credit bureau is reporting it, whether it\u2019s Experian, Equifax or TransUnion.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s easier than ever to check your credit report. You can check free sites like the Discover credit card site, which says, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be our customer, and there\u2019s no ding to your credit.\u201d\n\nThe important thing is to check your credit reports. You should start with the three credit bureaus, each of which gives you one free credit report every year.\n\n5. Freeze your credit\n\nYou may have heard financial advisers telling people to freeze their credit. But you may not know why they\u2019re suggesting that.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple overview. Hackers will have a tough time accessing your personal information if you\u2019ve asked the credit bureaus to freeze your credit-- you can\u2019t access it, either, unless you ask them to unfreeze it.\n\nThe federal government starting this year mandates that you can freeze your credit for free by calling the three credit bureaus, Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. They have to freeze your credit within one business day of you requesting the freeze by phone or on their websites.\n\nTo help you out, I have the steps to freeze your credit on my site.

Though Poland was ruled by Russia, Germany and Austria, and effectively was \"wiped off the map\" as a state, it was nonetheless a great age for Polish culture, producing the compositions of Frederic Chopin and the works of the great Romantic-era poet Adam Mickiewicz, which largely revolved around the yearning for Poland's rebirth.\n\nThroughout it all, the Roman Catholic church played a key role in keeping the language and the identity alive.\n\nContemplations of Poland's historic achievement in 1918 are inevitably shaped by knowledge of what came later, with Poland to be invaded and occupied yet again in the 20th century by the Germans and the Soviets, and then being under Moscow's influence during the Cold War era.", "As the world marked the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I on Sunday, global leaders gathered in Paris to commemorate the solemn moment as France's president implored countries to forge alliances to preserve peace.\n\nThe ceremony for the Armistice Day centennial observance at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier featured more than 60 heads of state and government officials gathered as French President Emmanuel Macron warned about the fragility of peace and the dangers of nationalism.\n\n\"Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism,\" Macron said. \"Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. In saying 'Our interests first, whatever happens to the others,' you erase the most precious thing a nation can have, that which makes it live, that which causes it to be great and that which is most important: Its moral values.\"\n\nMacron warned that \"ancient demons\" that caused World War I and millions of deaths are growing stronger, and that global leaders should \"fight for peace.\n\n\"Let us build our hopes rather than playing our fears against each other,\" he said.\n\nMacron made the comments as Trump, who has proudly declared himself a nationalist and proclaimed to be \"America First,\" watched on.\n\nLast week at a news conference, Trump said: \"You have nationalists. You have globalists. I also love the world and I don't mind helping the world, but we have to straighten out our country first. We have a lot of problems.\"\n\nThe president plans to visit the American cemetery at Suresnes on the outskirts of Paris on Sunday afternoon and make remarks before heading home.\n\nThe commemorations on Sunday started late, overshooting the centenary of the exact moment when, 100 years earlier at 11 a.m., the eerie silence of peace replaced the thunder of guns in Western France.\n\nWORLD WAR I CENTENNIAL: US AUTHOR HONORS GRANDFATHER BY RETURNING KEY TAKEN FROM FRANCE 100 YEARS AGO\n\nAs bells marking the armistice hour started ringing out across Paris and in many nations hit by the four years of slaughter, Macron and other leaders were still on their way to the centennial site at the Arc de Triomphe, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAmong the line of world leaders, Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were positioned between Trump and Macron. The geographical spread of the leaders in attendance showed how the \"war to end all wars\" left few corners of the earth untouched but which, little more than two decades later, was followed so quickly and catastrophically by the even deadlier World War II.\n\nTHIS VETERANS DAY LET US ESPECIALLY REMEMBER THOSE WHO PERISHED IN THE GREAT WAR\n\nIn the four years of fighting, remembered for brutal trench warfare and the first use of gas, France, the British empire, Russia and the United States had the main armies opposing a German-led coalition that also included the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires. Almost 10 million soldiers died, sometimes tens of thousands on a single day.\n\nThe United States came late to the war, in April 1917, but over 1\u00bd years it became a key player in the conflict and tipped the scales for the Allies. When the war ended on Nov. 11, 1918, the U.S. armed forces were on the cusp of becoming the major military power in the world.\n\nEven though Germany was at the heart of provoking two world wars over the past century, the nation has become a beacon of European and international cooperation since.\n\nOn Sunday, Merkel met with the head of the United Nations, born from the ashes of World War II, and the president of Serbia. It was a Serb teenager, Gavrilo Princip, who assassinated the Austro-Hungarian crown prince in Sarajevo in 1914 to set off events which led to the outbreak of war.\n\nFox News' Kristin Brown and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nA hundred years later, their words can still pierce hearts.

We got news of the armistice at 9:30 this morning. I got 10 minutes to sort out a detachment for a grand parade in the square of Mons, so I got everybody I could lay hand to scrub the mud off. The streets were packed with wildly cheering civilians chucking flowers at us and carrying on like only a foreigner can. All the street and the square was a blaze of color, mostly, of course the Belgian colors red, yellow and black. Union Jacks, French flags, American flags, in fact every conceivable flag of the allies.\"\n\n--British officer Charles Neville, Royal Horse Artillery\n\n___\n\n\"The war is over and in an hour we will leave.

How can we comprehend this?\n\nAnd we who are here, who should laugh and cry out for joy, feel a heaviness in our stomachs.\"\n\n--German foot soldier and writer Erich Maria Remarque, Regiment of the XV Infantry Reserve, from the book \"After\"\n\n___\n\n\"The sirens of the factories seemed to be sounding and cries and joyful songs ring out. The end of the war was announced.\n\n... At 11 a.m., arms and work stopped everywhere. I wanted to see for myself how the French celebrated the armistice. In the city, there was already a sea of people: men and women, young and old, soldiers and civilians, people of all skin colors marched together, hand in hand, singing or cheering.\"\n\n--Chinese laborer Gu Xinggqing, working in a depot in the Normandy city of Rouen; tens of thousands of Chinese laborers were brought to support the war effort.\n\n___\n\n\"In the parade were hundreds of thousands of soldiers from the U.S., England, Canada, France, Australia, Italy and the colonies. Each soldier had his arms full of French girls, some crying, others laughing; each girl had to kiss every soldier before she would let him pass.

It was a poor choice of words. The man is a war hero and he deserves all of the respect in the world. And if any good came of this, maybe it was that for one day the left and the right finally came together to agree on something: that I'm a d---,\u201d he added.\n\n\"If any good came of this, maybe it was that for one day the left and the right finally came together to agree on something: that I'm a d---.\u201d \u2014 Pete Davidson, \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member\n\nNext it was Crenshaw\u2019s turn. After accepting Davidson's apology, he got a call on his cellphone - which featured a ringtone of the Ariana Grande song \"Breathin.\"\n\nDavidson appeared to be surprised but laughed in response.\n\nThen Crenshaw took a few shots at the \"SNL\" star.\n\n\u201cThis is Pete Davidson,\u201d Crenshaw said as a photo of Davidson appeared. \u201cHe looks like if the meth from 'Breaking Bad' was a person,\u201d Crenshaw said. \u201cHe looks like a troll doll with a tapeworm.\u201d And then, \u201cHe looks like Martin Short in 'The Santa Clause 3.' By the way, one of these people was actually good on 'SNL.'\"\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Davidson replied.\n\nSince Saturday's episode fell on Veterans Day weekend, Crenshaw told viewers the best way to respect service members is to tell them \"Never forget.\"\n\n\u201cNever forget those we lost in war, and never forget those we lost on 9/11, like Pete\u2019s father.\u201d \u2014 U.S. Rep.-elect Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas\n\n\"When you say \u2018Never forget,\u2019 you are implying that as an American you are in it with them, not separated by a barrier between civilians and veterans,\u201d Crenshaw said directly to the camera. \u201cNever forget those we lost in war, and never forget those we lost on 9/11, like Pete\u2019s father.\u201d He and Davidson then each respectfully told each other, \u201cNever forget.\u201d", "It\u2019s Veterans Day in America, and all across the country Americans will pause to pay tribute to men and women who served in the armed forces of the United States. We have marked this day since the guns of the First World War fell silent on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month exactly 100 years ago today.\n\nPresident Trump will observe this day in France at the Armistice Day Centennial Commemoration. For our part, my wife and I will meet with veterans and service members at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska.\n\nFrom the time of our nation\u2019s birth, nearly 50 million men and women have answered the call to service, and nearly 20 million still walk among us today. Even now, a new generation of American veterans is being forged across the wider world\n\nThe debt our nation owes those who have worn the uniform is a debt we will never be able to fully repay. But just as those courageous men and women have fought for us, our entire administration has fought for them.\n\nThese courageous patriots have served the world over. From Bunker Hill to Belleau Wood and from the Coral Sea to Kandahar, American military members have offered their blood, toil, tears and sweat in service to our country. On Veterans Day we remember those who came home, but we cannot forget those who gave the last full measure of their devotion for our freedom.\n\nIt is written that \u201cif you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect.\u201d The debt our nation owes those who have worn the uniform is a debt we will never be able to fully repay. But just as those courageous men and women have fought for us, our entire administration has fought for them.\n\nVeterans have no better friend than President Trump.\n\nThis president and our administration understand that veterans\u2019 benefits are not entitlements \u2013 they\u2019re earned. They are the ongoing compensation for services rendered in the uniform of the United States. And since the outset of our administration, we\u2019ve taken decisive action to make good on our promise to the heroes who\u2019ve served.\n\nPresident Trump has signed the most substantial veterans\u2019 health-care reform in a generation, making Veterans Choice a permanent part of American law. Today our veterans have access to the real-time, world-class care they have earned, whether at a private health-care provider or the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nThis law will also improve the VA\u2019s ability to recruit and retain quality health-care professionals, give veterans access to walk-in care, and expand health-care choices, including options for telehealth and mental health services.\n\nPresident Trump has taken action to hold the VA accountable, signing the Veterans Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. Since our election, more than 4,200 VA employees have been fired, suspended or demoted for negligent behavior.\n\nWe enacted the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, which will improve our efforts to provide retroactive benefits to America\u2019s veterans. The VA has already identified and paid over $115 million over the last year.\n\nWe have also made historic progress towards ending veteran homelessness. Thanks to our reforms at the VA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, nearly 54,000 veterans found permanent housing and access to supportive services last year.\n\nAnd President Trump has taken steps to increase opportunities for veterans after they return to civilian life, including through enhancing and expanding the post-9/11 GI Bill to a lifetime benefit.\n\nOur actions are having a real impact on the men and women who have sacrificed for our country: health-care wait times are down, VA accountability is up, and under our administration unemployment among veterans has reached its lowest level in nearly two decades.\n\nWhile we honor our veterans by ensuring they receive the benefits they have earned, we also honor them by supporting the men and women who serve in the armed forces today.\n\nWith the strong support of veterans\u2019 organizations across the nation, President Trump signed into law the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. We are once again giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen the resources and training they need to accomplish their mission.\n\nThe United States of America remains the land of the free because we are still the home of the brave. The men and women who\u2019ve served in our armed forces are those brave, and today all of us should do our part to honor their service and appreciate their sacrifice.\n\nSo on this 100th Veterans\u2019 Day, I encourage every American to thank a veteran. Outside the grocery store, at your place of worship, or maybe over the backyard fence, I urge you to extend your hand, look them in the eye, and say those words that every veteran deserves to hear: \u201cThank you for your service.\u201d\n\nTo all of those who\u2019ve worn the uniform, on behalf of a grateful nation, Happy Veterans Day.", "It was the first day of my second internship in New York City. My friend Anna and I decided to grab a happy hour drink at the St. Regis Hotel after work to celebrate our second summer in the big city.\n\nWe were both from the Midwest and neither of us had ever been to the St. Regis, but we had heard it was the height of class and elegance \u2013 a place where those \u201csophisticated New York girls\u201d we\u2019d seen in movies would DEFINITELY hang out.\n\nRain poured down as we walked ten blocks in Midtown Manhattan, but we weren\u2019t going to be stopped; we were determined to have a glass of wine at the King Cole Bar. When we arrived it was everything we\u2019d imagined \u2013 the quintessential high-class New York cocktail lounge.\n\nA waiter immediately seated us and asked if we\u2019d like a drink menu. All too eager to look like we had been there before, we said, \u201cOh no no NOT necessary \u2013 we\u2019ll each just have a glass of the Malbec.\u201d\n\nThe waiter came back with our two glasses and a cocktail menu \u201cjust in case we wanted to try something else.\u201d I sat back and sipped my wine, taking everything in when I heard Anna almost yell, \u201cOh. My. Gosh!\u201d\n\nWhile perusing the drink menu she had discovered that a single glass of Malbec was $32.00. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d I said as I snatched the menu to see for myself. And there it was staring back at me. \u201cNo wonder we\u2019re the only 22 year-old girls at this bar!\u201d she said. We both started laughing hysterically. It dawned on us that this glass of wine would also count as our dinner and probably breakfast the next day. Who were we kidding? We were trying to be something we weren\u2019t and New York laughed right back in our faces.\n\nAs we made fun of ourselves together, laughing our heads off in the middle of this mess we\u2019d put ourselves in, I revealed to Anna that this blunder was just another example of my life at that time being a mess. I had been feeling a deep sense of emptiness; I knew something was off \u2013 but had no idea how to fix it.\n\nI had grown up as a Christian but fell away from my religious routines when I went to college. I was going to too many parties, my dating life was not great, and it seemed as though the harder I tried to fix all of my problems, the more chaos I created around myself.\n\nI told Anna that I knew I needed to make changes, but didn\u2019t know if God would be willing to help me. I felt as though my mistakes were too many and my problems too small for Him to forgive me. \u201cWill any adjustments I make to my lifestyle really make up for all the mistakes I\u2019ve already made?\u201d I asked her.\n\nShe stared back at me with wide eyes and said, \u201cThis is so weird, Christen. I literally went through this exact same thing six months ago.\u201d She proceeded to tell me about her past mistakes \u2013 most exactly the same as mine \u2013 and that not long ago she shared the same doubts as I about her worthiness to be forgiven by God. But then she said, \u201cGirl, you\u2019re missing the grace factor! He has ALREADY forgiven everything you\u2019ve ever done. He\u2019s literally just waiting for you to accept all of the love He wants to shower you with. He opened up my eyes six months ago to His unconditional love and my life has never been better.\u201d\n\nThough this might sound strange, as Anna was speaking, I sensed a shift in my heart. I felt as though God was giving Anna those words in that exact moment so that I could hear Him and come home to Him.\n\nI was immediately hooked. I ran home to God and I haven\u2019t let go since. I began spending time with Him daily, slowly but surely giving Him control of every area of my life. My heart was completely transformed that day \u2013 all thanks to a glass of wine I couldn\u2019t afford.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nThe Latest on commemorations a century after the end of World War I (all times local):\n\n9:30 a.m.\n\nNothing is left to chance in the seating of world leaders at the Arc de Triomphe commemoration of the end of World War I.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron will be seated between his wife and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

They then made their way to New York City, staying in high-end hotels and eventually maxing out the older sister's credit card.\n\nWhat happened next is still under investigation. Their bodies, fully clothed and showing no obvious signs of trauma, were found Oct. 24 along the rocky banks of the Hudson River wrapped together with tape.\n\nNew York City Police Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said people who knew the Farea sisters in Virginia told investigators that they made statements within the last year indicating \"that they would rather inflict harm on themselves \u2014 commit suicide \u2014 than return to Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nThat may be because in Saudi Arabia, women who try and flee have few good options. Under the kingdom's guardianship system women must have the approval of a male relative \u2014 such as a father, husband, brother, or even a son \u2014 to marry, obtain a passport or travel.\n\n\"The fact that they continue to be subjected to the guardianship system ... to the more sort of sinister issues which include physical or sexual abuse that they face at home, we've seen women in all these cases attempt to flee,\" said Human Rights Watch researcher Adam Coogle.\n\nCoogle said there are also women being pressured into marriages against their will. He did not specifically discuss the Farea sisters as their case is still under investigation.\n\nIn other instances, women are being barred by their guardians from marrying or their salaries are being confiscated.\n\nIf women who run away are caught, they can be pressured to return home or placed in shelters where often the only way out is to escape again. Others are jailed and only a male guardian can sign for their release.\n\nLast year, Saudi women's rights activist Mariam al-Otaibi spent more than 100 days in the women's section of al-Malaz prison in Riyadh after her father filed a complaint to police against her for leaving home. She'd moved from the ultraconservative province of Qassim to the capital, where supporters helped her rent an apartment and find work.\n\nShe was released after her case attracted the attention of activists and rights groups.\n\nAlso last year, a plea for help by a 24-year-old Saudi woman triggered a firestorm on social media with people seeking details about her disappearance. In an online video, Dina Ali Lasloom said her passport was confiscated at an airport in the Philippines on her way to Australia where she planned to seek asylum.\n\nWomen's rights advocates in Saudi Arabia said Lasloom was ultimately forced to board a plane to the kingdom with two of her uncles, who flew from Riyadh to stop her. They said authorities then took her to a women's shelter because of the attention around her case. A Saudi woman who tried to meet Lasloom at the airport in Riyadh to assist her was detained for several days by authorities.\n\nA group of Saudi women's rights activists had raised money locally for runaways and were planning to start a non-governmental organization to shelter abused women. But in May, authorities arrested at least nine of them and three of their male supporters. They remain detained on vague charges related to national security.\n\nFor runaway Saudi women, fleeing can be a matter of life and death, and they are almost always doing so to escape male relatives.\n\nIt's a problem Saudi society is grappling with. State-aligned newspapers report when women flee shelters and articles question the level of care and support women receive at such facilities.\n\nThe shelters have been described by Saudi activists as prison-like. Women inside cannot freely access the internet or mobile phones, their movements are restricted and often the only way to leave is with the signature of a male guardian. The shelters say they offer women psychiatric care and therapy, but do not take in women who, for example, are pregnant out of wedlock. Premarital sex can lead to criminal prosecution in Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries.\n\nThe most recent statistics from the Ministry of Labor and Social Development show that 577 Saudi women tried to flee their homes in 2015. That figure is likely to be much higher in reality because many families don't report runaways due to social stigma.\n\nThe Farea sisters had moved to the U.S. from Saudi Arabia with their mother and two brothers in 2015. The father spent time between the two countries, according to Arab News, which spoke to a relative.\n\nInvestigators say they believe the Farea sisters had filed for asylum. One of the problems women face in seeking asylum, though, is proving abuse.\n\n\"You have to have evidence for it and unless you have a threatening text (message), you may not have a very good asylum case,\" said Coogle of Human Rights Watch.\n\nAfter the Farea sisters died, witness called police with something he said had been \"haunting\" him. He'd seen the sisters standing apart at Riverside Park in New York, with their heads bowed into their hands praying loudly hours before their bodies were found. Investigators have stopped short of saying the sisters killed themselves, but say they have \"no credible information that any crime took place.\"\n\nThe sisters' bodies were returned to Saudi Arabia on Nov. 3 and they were buried the same day in Medina \u2014 home to one of Islam's holiest sites where the Prophet Muhammad is buried.\n\n\"This is a tragedy all the way around,\" said Shea, the chief of detectives in New York.\n\n___\n\nFollow Aya Batrawy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ayaelb .", "Philippine prosecutors said they will file charges of tax evasion against a news website that has been critical of President Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nThe Justice Department said in a statement it found probable cause to indict Rappler Holdings Corp. and its president, journalist Maria Ressa.
