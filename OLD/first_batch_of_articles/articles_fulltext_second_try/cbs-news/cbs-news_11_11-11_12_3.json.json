Four days have passed since the raging Camp Fire first ripped through the retirement community of Paradise and beyond, burning at a rate of 30 football fields per minute and hot enough to melt car parts. Downed PG&E power lines, combined with high winds, are believed to have sparked the fire.\n\nOne mobile home park was obliterated by the wildfire. Crews are now searching through tons of rubble and bringing in cadaver dogs. With more than 200 people still unaccounted for, families who are desperate for answers are posting pictures of their loved ones online and on message boards at shelters.\n\n\"In some cases the remains we are recovering are nothing but ash and bone,\" said Kory Honea, the Butte County sheriff.\n\nNoah Berger / AP\n\nState DNA experts are helping identify victims with chaplains and hearses nearby as bodies are found. Thousands of homes have been destroyed, including those of dozens of firefighters who continue to battle on the front lines to save other homes. The Camp Fire has ravaged more than 113,000 acres and destroyed more than 6,000 homes.\n\nOne man, Ed Gleason, didn't evacuate, and his house was one was of the few still standing today. But at least seven people died in their cars as they tried to evacuate. The blaze was so hot that aluminum wheels on vehicles melted.\n\nReed Saxon / AP\n\nDarrell Wilken, a registered nurse, is thankful to be alive. He drove right through the towering inferno with three of his elderly patients as they fled Paradise.\n\n\"Everywhere the cars were on fire and I didn't see anybody walking and all I could think of is there were people in those cars,\" Wilken said.\n\nIt took more than three hours to get through hell.\n\n\"I'm still shaking. Every time I talk about it,\" he said.", "Some of the most prominent progressive members of Congress are backing off the idea they'll focus on abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, a proposal many of them pushed during the midterm campaign.\n\nAt the Congressional Progressive Caucus' first press conference since Democrats won control of the House, leaders fielded questions about whether they would continue to push legislation to get rid of ICE.\n\n\"We are absolutely still going to be pressing that,\" said Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, the caucus co-chair. \"However, I think our main goal of getting out of the gate is going to be the issues that we ran on across all districts \u2014 around healthcare, around good-paying jobs, around dealing with the culture of corruption.\"\n\nPocan, who in July released a statement saying ICE must be abolished, added, \"I still think many of us still have issues of immigration reform as a very, very high priority.\"\n\nThe slogan \"Abolish ICE\" became both a rallying cry and a lightning rod during the 2018 election cycle for the far left across the country.\n\nRep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., was standing with Progressive Caucus leaders at Monday's press conference. She helped popularize the idea during her successful insurgent campaign. Ocasio-Cortez, who identifies herself as a democratic socialist, unseated 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley during the Democratic primary.\n\nSeveral other representatives-elect who also called for the abolition of ICE, including Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, also attended the news conference.\n\nCongressional Progressive Caucus / Facebook\n\nPocan and two fellow Progressive Caucus leaders introduced legislation over the summer aimed at scrapping the agency. One of the lawmakers who introduced the legislation, Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, took issue with the attention paid to the \"Abolish Ice\" slogan and wondered whether any of the assembled reporters had read her bill, which she said focuses on reforming the immigration system.\n\n\"I would really love it if all of you would read the bill and if you would report on what was in the bill and how we propose building immigration that is humane, where enforcement is transparent, saves taxpayers dollars, and is effective,\" Jayapal said.\n\nIn July, Jayapal's office issued a press release about the bill with the headline, \"Members of Congress Introduce Legislation to Terminate ICE and Transfer Critical Functions to Other Agencies.\"\n\nLater Monday, Jayapal told reporters she had \"never used\" the \"Abolish ICE\" slogan. She said progressives \"need to stop taking the president's frame for this issue.\"\n\n\"ICE is the agency that is not accountable, humane and transparent and effective. So I think that this agency as it exists is not doing a good job for us. That doesn't mean we are getting rid of enforcement overall, and I just think there's a real distinction between abolishing an agency and abolishing the function. And it would be great for people to just think about that,\" Jayapal told CBS News.\n\nAfter the legislation was introduced over the summer, House Republicans tried to force a vote on the bill in an apparent effort to put Democrats on the record on abolishing ICE. The progressives responded by saying they would vote down their own bill and called the move a \"political stunt,\" according to The Hill. The bill has not been considered on the floor.", "", "PHILADELPHIA -- The fifth great-grandson of Alexander Hamilton loaned some family heirlooms, including a ring that has a lock of his hair inside, to the Museum of the American Revolution Monday.\n\nDouglas Hamilton was in Philadelphia to give the artifacts to the museum to be featured as part of the museum's \"Year of Hamilton\" in an exhibit called \"Hamilton Was Here: Rising Up in Revolutionary Philadelphia.\" The items include a Society of the Cincinnati Eagle insignia worn and owned by Hamilton and a gold mourning ring - featuring a lock of his hair set under a glass jewel - worn by his wife Elizabeth after his death.\n\n\"My dad never talked to me about it,\" Douglas Hamilton said of growing up as a Founding Father descendant. \"The only story I got from my father was that being a descendant from Alexander Hamilton and 10 cents would get you a cup of coffee.\"\n\nThe 67-year-old Ohio man said their famous distant relative wasn't something the family focused on. He said a cardboard box containing the heirlooms was passed quietly from generation to generation, and stowed away until it passed on again.\n\nMatt Rourke / AP\n\nBut as Hamilton's legacy has re-emerged with the hit Broadway musical and a number of books in recent years, he has been embracing his ancestor and sharing his stories and objects. He even has a grandson named Alexander Hamilton who was born on what might have been the 250th anniversary of the Founding Father's birth. (His birthday has been speculated as Jan. 11, 1755 or Jan. 11, 1757.)\n\n\"I think it's important as time goes by to make sure they're remembered,\" he said Monday inside the workroom at the museum, where curators were preparing his loaned items, which also include a never-before-displayed handkerchief embroidered with Elizabeth's name, and a baby dress with an accompanying note saying it was made by her. After they undergo conservation, the heirlooms will be put on display in early 2019.\n\n\"These items give us a glimpse into the personal lives of Alexander and Elizabeth Hamilton and we're honored and delighted that Doug and his family have chosen to loan them to us,\" said Philip Mead, the museum's chief historian and director of curatorial affairs.\n\nThe Alexander Hamilton Awareness Society connected Doug Hamilton with the museum.\n\nMatt Rourke / AP\n\n\"He just called me one day out of the blue and introduced himself and I said, 'Boy, this doesn't happen every day that a Hamilton calls you and offers to loan national treasures,'\" Mead said. That Hamilton offered to drive the items to the museum himself to drop them off was even better, he added.\n\nAlexander Hamilton was an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati, which was founded by officers of the Continental Army at the American Revolutionary War. The pendant on loan has its original ribbon, which is significantly worn from use.\n\nDoug Hamilton said the last time Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton met before their fateful duel was at a meeting of the Society of the Cincinnati at Fraunces Tavern in New York City, and he speculates his ancestor was wearing the pendant during that last interaction.\n\nThe mourning ring dates from about 1804, and follows a common practice of the 18th century, encasing a lock of Elizabeth Hamilton's late-husband's hair under a glass jewel. She lived for more than 50 years after Hamilton was killed in the duel with Burr, dying on Nov. 9, 1854 at the age of 97.\n\nThe exhibit runs through March 17, 2019.", "CALABASAS, Calif. \u2014 More than 3,000 firefighters have been waging an all-out attack on the Woolsey Fire, on land and from the air.

But statistics aside, the accident is making travelers wary of flying in some countries or on certain foreign airlines. The safety of Indonesia's airlines had been questioned long before the Lion Air accident.\n\n\"There has been a lot more trepidation about flying smaller airlines that Americans have never heard of\" since the Oct. 29 Lion Air crash, said Blake Fleetwood, president of Cook Travel in New York. \"It is pushing people to the bigger airlines. People are scared.\"\n\nBefore plunking down big money to book international flights, nervous flyers can tap into resources that can provide red-flag warnings if there are doubts about a carrier's safety.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration determines whether countries meet international safety standards set by the United Nations' aviation agency. Five currently do not: Thailand, Bangladesh, Ghana, Curacao and Sint Maarten. Airlines from those countries can't launch new flights to the U.S. (Indonesia got off the blacklist in 2016.)\n\n\n\nEurope bans 120 airlines from its skies. Most are smaller carriers from developing countries in Africa and parts of Asia. Lion Air was banned for nearly a decade until 2016; other blackballed Indonesian carriers only got off the list in June.\n\n\n\nAviation Safety Network has an accident database that can be searched by airline or country.\n\n\n\nWebsites like AirlineRatings.com rank carriers based on crash records and other data. That site gave Lion Air a rating of one star out of seven in 2016 but six out of seven last year, after U.S. and European regulators upgraded Indonesia's aviation regulatory regime. Such ratings have their critics. Skytrax , a UK company that does research for airlines and surveys travelers on airline quality, says there is no objective way to rank airlines on safety due to uneven reporting of incidents by airlines and regulators around the world.\n\n\n\nCompanies such as Argus International will provide reports on charter airlines. Since they charge a fee, typically $50 to $150, such services are mostly used by corporate travel departments.\n\n\n\nFatal airline accidents have been declining for about two decades. By some accounts, 2017 was the safest year yet. The Aviation Safety Network and To70 , an aviation consultant in the Netherlands, said there were no fatal crashes involving commercial passenger airlines last year. The reports excluded cargo planes, military aircraft and flights on planes certified to carry fewer than 14 people.\n\n\"Aviation safety has become much better even in places that were notoriously unsafe at one time,\" said Alberto Riva, managing editor of The Points Guy , a website for frequent flyers.\n\nWithin a country, Riva said, some airlines have better safety records than others. He said he would not worry about flying on Garuda Indonesia, the national carrier, \"but if I could find a way to circumvent Lion Air, I would do that.\"\n\nFleetwood, the travel agent, said, \"I would steer clear of any airline that is not certified to fly to the European Union.\"\n\nMatt Kepnes, who wrote \"How to Travel the World on $50 a Day,\" said he follows the news closely enough to have a sense of which airlines have good safety records. \"I don't do much digging beyond that unless it is an airline I haven't heard of, especially one that doesn't fly to the U.S. or [European Union], as they have tight airline regulations. Then I look.\"\n\nKepnes said airlines that fly to many countries tend to have a better safety record. He is more cautious about smaller airlines and domestic carriers in countries where he doesn't trust the safety standards.\n\n\"I won't fly a Russian carrier ... they have a history of poor safety and the planes are quite old,\" he said. \"Indonesia has a spotty safety record, so I don't like flying their domestic airlines. The same for India.\"\n\nJay Johnson, president of Coastline Travel Advisors in Garden Grove, California, said clients frequently ask about personal safety, but are less likely to ask if transportation is risky.\n\n\"Because there is so much attention placed on dangerous countries or regions, travelers tend to ask questions of safety on the ground rather than how they get there,\" he said. He said air travel in the U.S. is so safe that when people ask about a specific airline, it's usually about creature comforts and not safety records.\n\n\"It's almost as if travelers assume they will arrive safely, but does the airline have lay-flat beds?\" he said.\n\nTravel agents frequently recommend buying travel insurance for overseas itineraries in case you are unable to make the trip. However, if you try to cancel because the airline on which you are scheduled to fly has an accident, insurance is unlikely to reimburse you. Cancellations are covered only if the reason is specifically listed in the policy \u2014 such as terrorism, a weather event or illness \u2014 said Jenna Hummer of Squaremouth.com , a travel insurance-comparison site.\n\nThe exception is for people who buy a \"cancel for any reason\" policy. However, such policies generally must be bought when you book the trip or soon after, and they typically cost about 40 percent more than standard trip-cancellation insurance, Hummer said.", "", "Netflix's \"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\" is giving its fans a holiday treat.

Bill Nelson called on Republican Gov. Rick Scott to recuse himself from \"any role\" in Florida's recount process as the supervisors of elections across the state began a mandatory machine recount of more than 8.2 million ballots cast in this year's U.S. Senate race.\n\nDuring an emergency hearing Monday, Circuit Chief Judge Jack Tuter said he's seen no evidence of wrongdoing in the vote-counting in Broward County and urged all sides to \"ramp down the rhetoric.\" Tuter said there is a need to reassure citizens that the integrity of the Florida recount is being protected.\n\nBut President Trump again alleged without evidence that the state was dealing with voter fraud, writing in a Tweet Monday morning that \"large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged.\"\n\nThe state's law enforcement arm and elections monitors have found no evidence of wrongdoing, but lawyers for the Republican party and the GOP candidates joined with Mr. Trump in alleging that irregularities, unethical behavior and fraud have taken place since the polls closed last week.\n\nThe developments make this a tumultuous political moment in Florida. This recount process is unprecedented even in a state notorious for settling elections by razor-thin margins. State officials said they weren't aware of any other time a race for governor or U.S. Senate required a recount, let alone both in the same election.\n\nIn a video statement, Nelson said Scott is \"using his power as governor to try to undermine the voting process,\" as he called on him to remove himself from the recount. \"He's worried when all the votes are counted, he'll lose the election,\" he said. The Scott campaign said he will be coming to Washington this week to participate in some orientation activities for new members of Congress, including the photo and voting in leadership elections.\n\nUnofficial results showed Republican former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points in the governor's contest.\n\nIn the Senate race, Scott's lead over Nelson was 0.14 percentage points.\n\nIn Broward County, the recount was delayed for hours Sunday because of a problem with one of the tabulation machines. That prompted the Republican Party to accuse Broward's supervisor of elections, Brenda Snipes, of \"incompetence and gross mismanagement.\"\n\nBroward officials faced further headaches after acknowledging the county mistakenly counted 22 absentee ballots that had been rejected. The problem seemed impossible to fix because dismissed ballots were mixed in with 205 legal ballots and Snipes said it would be unfair to throw out all the votes.\n\nScott filed suit against Snipes. He's seeking a court order for law enforcement agents to impound all voting machines, tallying devices and ballots \"when not in use until such time as any recounts.\" The suit accused Snipes of repeatedly failing to account for the number of ballots left to be counted and failing to report results regularly as required by law.\n\nThe court didn't immediately respond, though the outcry from Democrats was immediate.\n\nJuan Penalosa, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, accused Scott of \"using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our democracy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Palm Beach County, the supervisor of elections said she didn't think her department could meet Thursday's deadline to complete that recount, throwing into question what would happen to votes there.\n\nThe recount in other major population centers, including Miami-Dade and Pinellas and Hillsborough counties in the Tampa Bay area, has been continuing without incident. Smaller counties were expected to begin reviews between Monday and Wednesday.\n\nState law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Once completed, if the differences in any of the races are 0.25 percentage points or below, a hand recount will be ordered.\n\nRepublicans urged their Democratic opponents to give up and let the state to move on.\n\nGillum and Nelson insist that each vote should be counted and the process should take its course.\n\nScott said Sunday that Nelson wants fraudulent ballots and those cast by noncitizens to count, pointing to a Nelson lawyer's objection of Palm Beach County's rejection of one provisional ballot because it was cast by a noncitizen.\n\n\"He is trying to commit fraud to win this election,\" Scott told Fox News. \"Bill Nelson's a sore loser. He's been in politics way too long.\"\n\nNelson's campaign issued a statement later saying their lawyer wasn't authorized to object to the ballot's rejection, as \"Non-citizens cannot vote in US elections.\"\n\nGillum appeared Sunday evening at a predominantly African-American church in Fort Lauderdale, declaring that voter disenfranchisement isn't just about being blocked from the polling booth. He said it also includes absentee ballots not being counted and ballots with mismatched signatures that \"a volunteer may have the option of ... deciding that vote is null and void.\"\n\nBoth the state elections division, which Scott runs, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement have said they have found no evidence of voter fraud.\n\nThat didn't stop protests outside Snipes' office, where a mostly Republican crowd gathered, holding signs, listening to country music and occasionally chanting \"lock her up,\" referring to Snipes. A massive Trump 2020 flag flew over the parking lot and a Bikers For Trump group wore matching shirts. One protester wore a Hillary Clinton mask.\n\nRegistered independent Russell Liddick, a 38-year-old Pompano Beach retail worker, carried a sign reading, \"I'm not here for Trump! I'm here for fair elections! Fire Snipes!\" He said the office's problems \"don't make me feel very much like my vote counted.\"\n\nFlorida also is conducting a recount in a third statewide race. Democrat Nikki Fried had a 0.07 percentage point lead over Republican state Rep. Matt Caldwell for agriculture commissioner, one of Florida's three Cabinet seats.\n\nFor some, the recounts bring back memories of the 2000 presidential recount, when it took more than five weeks for Florida to declare George W. Bush the victor over Vice President Al Gore by 537 votes, thus giving Bush the presidency.\n\nMuch has changed since then.\n\nIn 2000, each county had its own voting system. Many used punch cards \u2014 voters poked out chads, leaving tiny holes in their ballots representing their candidates. Some voters, however, didn't fully punch out the presidential chad or gave it just a little push. Those hanging and dimpled chads had to be examined by the canvassing boards, a lengthy, tiresome and often subjective process that became fodder for late-night comedians.\n\nNow the state requires all Florida counties to use ballots where voters use a pen to mark their candidate's name, much like a student taking a multiple-choice test, and the process for recounts is clearly spelled out.", "Marvel stars and other celebrities paid tribute to Marvel legend Stan Lee, who died at a Los Angeles hospital Monday, a family attorney said.

The Cook County sheriff's office says officers responded shortly after 4 a.m. Sunday to a call of shots fired at Manny's Blue Room in Robbins. Sheriff's spokeswoman Sophia Ansari says an officer from nearby Midlothian arrived and shot a man later identified as 26-year-old security guard Jemel Roberson.\n\nThe officer shot Roberson despite people \"screaming\" that he was a security guard, said Adam Harris, who told WGN-TV that he witnessed the shooting. Witness Rev. Marvin Hunter said Roberson played the organ at his and other area churches, and called him an \"upstanding\" man.\n\nWitnesses said Roberson was armed and was holding down the gunman responsible for the initial shooting, when the Midlothian officer shot him, reports CBS Chicago.\n\nRoberson's mother has filed a federal lawsuit against the unnamed officer and the village of Midlothian, accusing the officer of using excessive force, the station reports. The lawsuit alleges the officer's decision to shoot Roberson, an aspiring police officer, was unreasonable, unprovoked, and unjustified.\n\n\"We're still processing,\" pastor and family friend LeAundre Hill told the station. \"To be on the job, saving lives \u2013 again, which is what he loves to do, just to help people \u2013 and then to lose his life, in essence doing what he wanted to do, is just complete devastation.\"\n\nAnsari says four other people had gunshot wounds, but their injuries weren't considered life-threatening. She says at least one of them was believed to have fired shots during the shooting before police arrived. The suspected gunman remains hospitalized and charges are pending against him, she said.\n\nOfficers from Robbins and Midlothian were the first on the scene. Robbins police Chief Roy Wells told reporters Sunday the initial shooting stemmed from an argument.\n\nIllinois State Police have taken over the investigation. The agency didn't immediately return a message seeking details about the case Monday.\n\nMidlothian Police declined to comment on the circumstances of the shooting until the state police investigation is completed, reports CBS Chicago.\n\nMidlothian Police Chief Daniel Delaney told the station the officer involved is on paid administrative leave.\n\nDelaney told the station the unidentified officer has been with the Midlothian Police Department for about four years, and was previously an officer at another department for three years. The officer is a Midlothian patrol officer, and team leader for the South Suburban Emergency Response Team, a regional SWAT team, Delaney said.\n\nFamily and friends told the station they believe the officer may have mistaken Roberson for the gunman.\n\n\"They just want answers, so that his mom, his loved ones can have some peace, if there's ever any peace that comes with these type of situations,\" Hill said.", "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will not appear before an \"international grand committee\" of at least five governments investigating disinformation and election meddling, according to a letter from Facebook obtained by CBS News. The hearing is scheduled for Nov. 27.\n\nZuckerberg initially turned down an invitation by Damian Collins, a member of British Parliament, and Bob Zimmer, a Canadian lawmaker. But he was invited again after Argentina, Australia and Ireland signed on to the joint inquiry.\n\nOn Monday, Facebook's Head of Public Policy for the United Kingdom, Rebecca Stimson, declined on Zuckerberg's behalf, writing in the letter that Zuckerberg will be unavailable.\n\n\"Thank you for the invitation to appear before your Grand Committee. As we explained in our letter of November 2nd, Mr. Zuckerberg is not able to be in London on November 27th for your hearing and sends his apologies,\" Stimson wrote.\n\nZimmer told CBS News that the international group of politicians intend to respond to the rejection soon. Zimmer is chair of the Canadian Parliament's Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics.\n\nHe noted that Facebook did not address whether Zuckerberg might be available in the future. Facebook did not immediately reply to an email from CBS News seeking clarification on that point.\n\nThe letter from Facebook includes a rundown of efforts and studies documenting the company's ongoing push to combat false news and the work done by its election teams to bring transparency to political advertising.\n\n\"You may have heard us refer to some of this work already during the many hearings and communications we've had with committees and Governments around the world,\" Stimson wrote.\n\nFacebook has repeatedly noted in its refusals to send Zuckerberg to Westminster that Zuckerberg has appeared before Congress and the European Union Parliament, saying in a Nov. 2 letter, \"It is not possible for Mr. Zuckerberg to be available to all Parliaments.\"\n\nThe grand committee says its five governments represent 170 million Facebook users. It proposed meeting in one location, offering a way for Zuckerberg to address their concerns.\n\nMore governments may sign on, according to a spokesperson for the British Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee.\n\n\"There is growing interest from other nations to join the committee,\" the spokesperson said in an email to CBS News. She did not indicate which specific countries are interested. On Monday, the U.K. committee launched a social media campaign aimed at pressuring Zuckerberg to attend.\n\nFive Parliaments from across the world who represent 170 million @facebook users are asking Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence to them.

A refusal to comply with a subpoena could ultimately lead to a finding of contempt of Parliament, he said.\n\nThe effort to get Zuckerberg to appear before the multi-nation investigation comes after Britain's Information Commissioner released a report on November 5 concluding that \"Facebook... failed to keep [users'] personal information secure because it failed to make suitable checks on apps and developers using its platform.\"\n\nThat conclusion mirrors a scathing preliminary report on \"disinformation and fake news\" written by the U.K. committee in July. It called for increased oversight of social media companies and election campaigns, while highlighting the use of \"scraped\" Facebook data by companies associated with the successful Brexit campaign and President Donald Trump's 2016 run.", "A Black Panther-inspired claw and a Power Rangers \"superstar blade\" are on the naughty list of toys this holiday season. That's because a consumer safety group warns that they're among the most dangerous for children.\n\nThe annual list of the holiday's worst toys include playthings that have the potential to harm children, according to World Against Toys Causing Harm, or W.A.T.C.H. The consumer advocacy group said the 10 toys on its 2018 list can cause injuries such as choking, strangulation, blunt force trauma or eye damage.\n\n\"The toys nominated for the 2018 'Worst Toys' List are illustrative of some of the types of potential hazards parents may encounter while holiday shopping but should not be considered the only potentially hazardous toys on the market,\" said W.A.T.C.H. President Joan Siff. \"The list is a hands-on-tool to help parents recognize what some of these potential hazards may look like.\"\n\nW.A.T.C.H.\n\nStill, the list may needlessly worry parents, said Steve Pasierb, CEO of the Toy Association, a toy industry trade group.\n\n\"Everything sold in the U.S. has to go through the strictest regimen in the world\" for safety testing, he said. A bigger issue, he said, are knock-off toys that appear on online marketplaces, which might not have gone through the same testing as toys approved to be sold in the U.S., he noted.\n\n\"A counterfeit could have sharp edges, it could break easily, it could have small parts,\" he said. \"If everything is $19, and you find one for $9,\" it could be a counterfeit, he added.\n\nToy sales increases slow down\n\n\n\nThe holiday season is the prime buying season for toys, and many retailers are expanding their toy selection in the wake of Toys R Us' demise earlier this year. Still, toys are under pressure from electronic games and apps, with toy sales rising 2 percent to $11.6 billion this year through September, according to NPD Group. That's half the pace of increase seen during the same time last year.\n\nWith movie and TV tie-ins popular with kids, it's no surprise that a few of them are on the list of W.A.T.C.H.'s toys to avoid. Among them are the Black Panther-related toy and Power Rangers gadget, but some retro toys are on the list as well, such as a Cabbage Patch Kid doll.\n\nThe U.S. recorded about 240,000 toy-related injuries in 2016, while 35 children died from toy-related incidents between 2014 to 2016, W.A.T.C.H. said, citing the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Every three minutes, a child is treated in an emergency room for a toy-related injury.\n\nParents and other consumers should be wary of buying toys online, since not being able to closely inspect packaging and the toy itself can lead to overlooking obvious hazards, the group said. W.A.T.C.H. recommends \"defensive\" toy shopping by inspecting products for defects and poor designs.\n\n\"W.A.T.C.H. cautions toy shoppers not to be lulled into a false sense of security that a toy is safe because it has a familiar brand name on the package or it's available from a well-known retailer,\" the group said in the statement.\n\nHere are the 10 toys W.A.T.C.H. said shoppers should avoid this holiday season:\n\nNickelodeon Nella Princess Knight Pillow Pets Sleeptime Lites: $19.99\n\nThis toy projects night-sky images, marketed as a way to make bedtime fun. Yet W.A.T.C.H. said even though it's marketed for infants as a nightlight, its packaging warns that it's \"not intended\" for crib use. Other parts of the toy present a potential ingestion hazard, and the manufacturer warns that \"battery acid leakage\" could be a hazard. The toy is found at Target and other retailers, W.A.T.C.H. said.\n\nNerf Vortex VTX Praxis Blaster: $34.99\n\nIn the wisdom of the holiday classic \"A Christmas Story,\" this toy gun might put your eye out. That's according to W.A.T.C.H., which said the toy's launch force presents the potential for eye and facial injuries.\n\nMarvel Black Panther Slash Claw: $9.99\n\nThis Hasbro toy is accompanied by a warning that children shouldn't hit or swing at people or animals, nor should it be used around breakable objects. Based on the popular Marvel movie, the claw is marketed to children as young as 5 who just might be tempted to \"slash\" like the superhero they look up to, W.A.T.C.H. said.\n\nPower Rangers Super Ninja Steel Superstar Blade: $29.99\n\nThe toy encourages children to \"power up,\" but doing so could cause injuries to themselves or others, thanks to the spring-loaded plastic blade, W.A.T.C.H. said. The packaging includes warnings about never hitting people with the toy, nor swinging or poking at them with it.\n\nCabbage Patch Kids Dance Time Doll: $14.99\n\nThis retro toy may appeal to millennial and Gen X parents who want their kids to relive mom and dad's fun with the Cabbage Patch Kid phenomenon, but the nostalgia probably doesn't include choking hazards. The doll has a removable headband that can be ingested, W.A.T.C.H. said.\n\nZoo Jamz Xylophone: $14.96\n\nThis toy, recommended for ages 1.5 to 4, doesn't come with any warnings, but W.A.T.C.H. said the drumstick handle can be mouthed and potentially occlude a young child's airway.\n\nNici Wonderland Doll: Miniclara the Ballerina: $24.99\n\nThis ballerina doll is marketed for children as young as 2, but it doesn't come with any warnings. It does come with a plush kitten that can detach from the doll and present a choking hazard for children.\n\nStomp Rocket Ultra Rocket: $19.99\n\nAimed at children 6 and up, this rocket stomper toy could lead to eye or facial injuries. The toy works when a kid stomps on an air pad, forcing air into a foam rocket that shoots upward. The toy includes warnings that it can lead to \"serious eye or face injuries.\"\n\nCutting Fruit: $39.99\n\nThis toy, aimed at children as young as 2, comes with a \"slicing knife\" made of hard plastic. The knife could potentially create blunt trauma injuries, W.A.T.C.H. said.\n\nChien A Promener Pull Along Dog: $14.99\n\nManufacturers continue to make \"pull toys\" with cords that are longer than 12 inches, which create a strangulation hazard, W.A.T.C.H. said. This toy has a string that's about 19 inches long, but it doesn't come with any warnings. The toy is marketed to children as young as 12 months old.", "Dr. Cathleen London isn't anti-gun. She's anti-gun violence.\n\nWhile volunteering at San Francisco General Hospital in the 1990s London helped a family whose daughter had fatally shot herself in the stomach. The patient, who was no older than 16, wasn't trying to kill herself; she was in a fight with a boyfriend and was trying to get his attention.\n\n\"I remember this girl on the gurney, sitting up screaming, 'Help me,'\" London, who now is a primary care physician in rural Maine, said in an interview with CBS News on Monday. \"It's not an injury you could get from any weapon besides a gun.\"\n\nThat moment, plus other experiences like it, pushed London to join scores of other doctors in a Twitter brawl that erupted over the weekend, pitting members of the medical community against the National Rifle Association. The physicians strongly pushed back after the gun lobby publicly told doctors to \"stay in your lane\" when it comes to gun research.\n\n\"Someone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane,\" wrote the NRA's twitter account. \"Most upsetting, however, the medical community seems to have consulted NO ONE but themselves.\"\n\nSomeone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane. Half of the articles in Annals of Internal Medicine are pushing for gun control. Most upsetting, however, the medical community seems to have consulted NO ONE but themselves. https://t.co/oCR3uiLtS7 \u2014 NRA (@NRA) November 7, 2018\n\nThe NRA was denouncing a recent American College of Physicians policy statement which deemed gun violence a \"public health crisis\" that \"requires the nation's immediate attention.\" The tweet came just hours before the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, which claimed 12 lives and once more refocused national attention on the gun debate.\n\nMany in the medical community jumped on the tweet, using the hashtag #ThisIsOurLane.\n\n\"Do you have any idea how many bullets I pull out of corpses weekly? This isn't just my lane. It's my f**king highway,\" wrote Judy Melinek, a forensic pathologist, in a tweet that went viral. Melinek, who regularly appears as an expert witness in homicide cases involving guns, estimates she's autopsied about 300 bodies that were victims of firearm violence.\n\nJudy Melinek\n\n\"That's the absurdity of some of the criticism, we know exactly what damage they do to the human body,\" Melinek said in a telephone interview with CBS News on Monday.\n\nLondon, who herself owns two handguns and two shotguns, aimed her Twitter ire at Ann Coulter, the conservative commentator known for provocative opinions.\n\n\"Emergency room doctors pull cue balls, vines & gummy bears out of human orifices every week,\" Coulter wrote. \"That doesn't make them experts on pool, horticulture or chewy candy.\"\n\n\"We do examine a**holes all day so it does make us an expert on them. You qualify,\" London fired back in a tweet.\n\nWhether doctors should be conducting research on gun violence has been the subject of intense debate between the medical community and pro-gun groups like the NRA for years. Such work has been limited by the Dickey Amendment, a provision in the 1996 omnibus federal spending bill which instructed that \"none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may be used to advocate or promote gun control.\"\n\nMany public health advocates, including London, view the bill as effectively a gag order on gun-violence research.\n\n\"It's the most reprehensible piece of legislative ever written,\" London said. \"It's disgusting and needs to go away.\"\n\nBecause of the legislation limiting federal funding, most research on gun violence occurs on a smaller scale. In its full critique of the American College of Physicians, the NRA points to the policy statement's reliance on studies with small sample sizes as a reason why the findings are not conclusive.\n\n\"The authors acknowledge evidence is limited but cite their own belief there is 'enough evidence' or simply argue the policy should be enacted anyway,\" wrote the NRA. \"Inconclusive evidence is not 'enough evidence.'\"\n\nMany in the medical community, including Melinek, feel it's their responsibility to address the what they believe is an epidemic of gun violence. She points out how research conducted by physicians on the automotive and cigarette industries helped inform public opinion and prompt regulations that ultimately saved countless lives.\n\n\"If you're muzzling doctors, then you can't do that research,\" Melinek said. \"How are we suppose to solve this problem?\"\n\nThe NRA did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nWhile the Dickey Amendment hasn't been repealed in full, a change of language introduced earlier this year did allow for a CDC study on gun deaths published on Friday. The study found that after a decade of decline, homicides by gun were on the rise and firearm suicides have steadily increased since the financial meltdown of 2007 and 2008, despite the economic rebound.\n\nCDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield told CBS News in an interview last month that his agency is \"poised\" for additional research on the causes of gun violence if Congress chooses to give it additional funding.", "Amid California's deadly wildfires, shares of two major California electric utility companies, PG&E and Edison International, sank Monday. Investors are worried the companies may be liable in the historic fires now engulfing large swaths of the state, killing at least 31 people.\n\nPG&E fell around 14 percent in late Monday trading, bringing its two-day decline to as much as 48 percent since the Camp Fire began to burn near San Francisco last week.\n\nEdison International lost more than one-third of its value over two trading days since the Woolsey and Hill fires broke out near Los Angeles late last week. The stock fell some 12 percent further on Monday.\n\nThe utilities could find themselves in a situation called inverse condemnation, a legal action under which the government takes private property but doesn't pay compensation, leaving the companies to sue, some analysts said.\n\n\"Although no evidence tying either firm to the fires has been released, we think that both utility companies face significant risk under the currently expansive definition of inverse condemnation,\" Height Capital analysts Clayton Allen and Katie Bays wrote in a note Monday.\n\nPG&E said in a statement it will cooperate with any investigations stemming from the massive wildfires in Northern California. The company told state regulators Thursday that it experienced a problem on an electrical transmission line near the site of the blaze minutes before the fire broke out. PG&E later saw damage to a transmission tower on the line.\n\nLynsey Paulo, a PG&E spokesperson, said the information was preliminary and stressed the cause of the fire has not been determined, according to a report from the Associated Press.\n\nPG&E equipment has been involved with several deadly wildfires this year in California, racking up costs of more than $2 billion, net of insurance payments tied to those fires, according to industry publication Utility Dive. The company warned of potential liabilities tied to 2017 wildfires and the risk of inverse condemnation in its annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nSouthern California Edison, a unit of Edison International serving that area, said in a statement Friday that it filed an initial report with preliminary information on the Woolsey fire with the California Public Utilities Commission. Like PG&E, the company also cited potential liability tied to last year's Southern California wildfires in its 2017 annual SEC filing.\n\nThere \"has been no determination of origin or cause of either wildfire,\" Southern California Edison said in the statement, the latest on its website. The company added it would \"fully cooperate with any investigations.\"\n\n--The Associated Press contributed to this story.", "", "", "Stan Lee, the legendary Marvel Comics co-creator and publisher, has died at 95. Kirk Schenck, an attorney for Lee's daughter, J.C. Lee, confirmed to CBS News that Lee died at a Los Angeles hospital on Monday.\n\nThe beloved \"God of the Marvel Universe\" was behind superheroes like Spider-Man, Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, the X-Men, the Avengers and the Fantastic Four. Lee was known for his cameos in Marvel movies, as well.\n\n\"J.C. Lee and all of Stan Lee's friends and colleagues want to thank all of his fans and well wishers for their kind words and condolences,\" Schenck said in a statement. \"Stan was an icon in his field. His fans loved him and his desire to interact with them. He loved his fans and treated them with the same respect and love they gave him.\"\n\nLee celebrated his 95th birthday in December, but showed no signs of putting his career to rest. In 2016, he talked to \"CBS Sunday Morning\" about his career and said of retirement, \"That's a dirty word. ... Well, you know, retired to do what? I'm doing what I want to do. So why would I want to retire from it?\"\n\nLast August, he revisited his career with a tribute in Beverly Hills called \"Stan Lee: Extraordinary.\" Ruffalo, Aisha Tyler, Lou Ferrigno, RZA and comics creator Todd McFarlane were among the speakers at the event hosted by Chris Hardwick.\n\nLee, who was born Stanley Martin Leiber in 1922, grew up in the Bronx during the Great Depression. He started working at a publishing house with a division called Timely Comics in 1939. That's where Lee got his start in storytelling.\n\n\"I'd fill the ink wells -- in those days they used ink!\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"I'd run down and get them sandwiches at the drug store, and I'd proofread the pages, and sometimes in proofreading I'd say, 'You know, this sentence doesn't sound right. It ought to be written like this.' 'Well, go ahead and change it!' They didn't care!\"\n\nLee helped shape characters like Destroyer, Father Time and Jack Frost at Timely Comics. Later, when he joined the army, he found that his skills were best used drawing.

The vast majority of those women winners are Democrats. Of the 99 women who have won, 86 of them are Democrats and only 13 are Republicans. There are 435 total seats in the House.\n\nIn the Senate, CBS News estimates the composition of the new Senate will at least match the current Senate, which has 23 women. That includes the race in Arizona, where both candidates for U.S. Senate, Martha McSally and Kirsten Sinema, are women. The number of women in the Senate could potentially increase if Cindy Hyde Smith in Mississippi wins her run-off election for U.S. Senate come Nov. 27. There were firsts for women in the Senate, too. Tennessee elected its first female senator in choosing Republican Marsha Blackburn, and Arizona is set to do the same, regardless of who wins.\n\nWomen have emerged victorious so far in nine races for governor. One additional race remains undecided in Georgia, where Democrat Stacy Abrams still hopes to best Republican Brian Kemp.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi emphasized in an interview with CBS News \"Face the Nation\" host Margaret Brennan that having so many women in Congress is a \"major accomplishment\" for Congress and the American people. There were just 12 women in Congress when Pelosi arrived in Congress three decades ago.\n\n\"I hope we will have a woman president very soon, but that's not the fact that we almost had one would have been motivation for me to say, 'There's a woman at the table.' It's very important,\" Pelosi said. \"You cannot have the four leaders of Congress, the president of the United States, these five people, and not have the voice of women. Especially since women were the majority of the voters, the workers in campaigns, and now part of this glorious victory.\"\n\n\"But these women bring each their individual excellence to the Congress, and we're very proud of it.

And is unending political warfare what the midterm voters wanted?\n\nAxios.com quoted a senior Democratic source on Monday who said the new Nancy Pelosi-led Congress (and yes, Pelosi will be the next speaker) is preparing a \"subpoena cannon\" to unload on the Trump White House.\n\nAnd \"cannon\" is right. Though the votes are still being counted in at least three states, Democrats have already identified at least 85 different targets, according to Axios, for their new investigatory powers. No, that's not a typo: 85 potential investigations.\n\nAnd counting.\n\nI have seen the future of American politics and it's 85 #RussiaGates with a dozen committee-chair Bob Muellers camped out round-the-clock on cable TV. And, as Pelosi told The Atlantic on Friday, the Democrats' anti-Trump artillery can reach even farther.\n\n\"Recognize one point,\" she said, \"What Mueller might not think is indictable could be impeachable.\"\n\nAnd there it is: The \"I\" word. In the months leading up to the midterms, Democrats insisted they had no interested in impeachment, no, no no. They just wanted to fix healthcare, maybe tinker with taxes. Republicans rejected this as political 'strategery' (as President George W. Bush might have said), promising that if Pelosi became Speaker on a Monday, the impeachment efforts would start on Tuesday.\n\nIt appears the Republican were onto something. \"Top Democrats, who had largely avoided the subject during the campaign, now tell us they plan to almost immediately begin exploring possible grounds for impeachment,\" Axios reports.\n\nTo be fair, Pelosi also told the Atlantic that she doesn't want to impeach President Trump. And the future speaker told Margaret Brennan on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that \"We are not scattershot...I think a word that you could describe about how Democrats will go forward in this regard is we will be very strategic.\"\n\nSo it's an \"impeachment cannon\" but it's not \"scattershot.\" That may be unclear, but the ultimate conclusion is obvious: Democrats are coming after Trump. Bigly.\n\nRepublicans claim to be delighted by the prospect. The phrase \"Democrats overplay their hand\" is running on a Fox News loop. In a National Review piece entitled \"Trump vs. Pelosi: A Match Made in Heaven,\" former Trump advisor Stephen Moore writes that with Pelosi in charge, \"liberals are about to hand to the GOP the gift that just keeps giving\u2026Trump finally has what he's been missing since he vanquished Crooked Hillary two years ago: a foil.\"\n\nThe pro-Trump spin has been that losing the House is really a win because it gives Trump something to run against\u2014think Harry Truman in 1948. And given the new majority's volatile mix of passionate progressives (like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York) and suburb-friendly moderates (such as Pennsylvania's Conor Lamb), it's likely the House will be a source of intra-party squabbling and liberal excess. As Democrats learned\u2014or should have\u2014last year, one over-the-top speech from a Maxine Waters goes a long way.\n\nThat's what Republicans are telling themselves. What they aren't talking about\u2014or even allowing themselves to think about\u2014is the very real possibility that one of the House committees could come up with a smoking gun. And not just about Russia and collusion.\n\nIn fact, that's probably the least of the president's worries. The Russia collusion story always suffered from an improbable plot line. What could Russia really do to win an election for Trump? Facebook ads and Twitter bots? And what has he delivered in return? This is hardly the stuff of impeachment.\n\nBut President Trump's tax returns, his business practices, the overlap between his personal interests and administration actions, etc.? Donald Trump has left a long line of rocks to be overturned, and Democrats finally have their hands on the shovels. How confident are Republicans that a person as undisciplined and (ahem) ethically-elastic as Donald Trump hasn't left a single thing for them to find?\n\nTrump supporters argue that their guy's been hit again and again already and nothing sticks. \"Teflon Don,\" they say.\n\nBut now that Democrats have the ability to prosecute their case via committee hearings and televised testimony, will the Teflon hold?

In many U.S. cities, there's a new metric to describe just how out of reach housing has gotten: The million-dollar neighborhood.\n\nMore than 800 neighborhoods across the country have a median home value over $1 million, according to a recent report from Trulia. Nationwide, the share of homes costing $1 million or more has doubled since 2012.\n\nIn many coastal cities, the million-dollar home has long been the rule, not the exception. In San Francisco, million-dollar homes have been the majority of real estate sales since 2015. Today, 81 percent of the city's housing stock is valued above $1 million. In San Jose, the figure is 70 percent. Indeed, there isn't a single neighborhood in the San Jose metro area where the median home costs less than $1 million, according to Trulia.\n\nBut the phenomenon has increasingly moved inland, Trulia data show. In the last year, more than 100 neighborhoods crossed the million-dollar mark, and three cities gained their first million-dollar neighborhoods: Indianapolis, Austin and Newport, Rhode Island.\n\n\"It's not just your LAs, San Franciscos and Long Islands\u2014a lot of cities have these really small enclaves of high-end housing,\" said Cheryl Young, senior economist at Trulia.\n\nBarton Creek, a suburb in the southwest of Austin, Texas, saw the median home value jump to $1.02 million, up 9% from $935,000 just one year ago. It's a newer gated neighborhood, with many houses built after 2000, according to Young, and immediately west of the area is the Barton Creek Habitat Preserve, a 4,000-acre nature preserve.\n\n\"It's a neighborhood that was certainly developed for luxury real estate, and it was just a matter of time until we could attach a million-dollar price tag to the neighborhood itself,\" said Young.\n\nCrows Nest, near Indianapolis, saw median home prices hit $1.07 million, up from about $977,000 last year.\n\n\"It has more of that estate feel. Some of the homes are relatively new, so it's seen as a really tony suburb of Indianapolis,\" said Young. Trulia currently lists two properties on sale in the neighborhood: a $5 million \"European-Inspired Masterpiece\" with four bedrooms and six bathrooms on 2.25 acres, and a 5,000-square-foot mansion recently reduced from $1.55 million to $1.43 million.\n\nNewport, Rhode Island, also saw a neighborhood jump the $1 million mark. In Lily-Almy Pond, the median home value increased from $843,000 last year to $1.15 million.

But one guy who's delivering heavy equipment in a Chinook\u2026 You don't go rescuing people in a Chinook \u2013 goes and turns around to his crew and says, 'Guys, should we go get them? We just heard the call.' And everybody on the crew said, 'Let's go get them.'

Their instructor offers advice: Don't think of your target as a human being.\n\n\n\nSo when these boys and girls shoot, they will shoot to kill.\n\n\n\nMost are in their teens, but some are as young as 8 years old. They are at a summer camp created by one of Ukraine's radical nationalist groups, hidden in a forest in the west of the country, that was visited by The Associated Press. The camp has two purposes: to train children to defend their country from Russians and their sympathizers - and to spread nationalist ideology.\n\n\n\n\"We never aim guns at people,\" instructor Yuri \"Chornota\" Cherkashin tells them. \"But we don't count separatists, little green men, occupiers from Moscow, as people. So we can and should aim at them.\"\n\nThe nationalists have been accused of violence and racism, but they have played a central, volunteer role in Ukraine's conflict with Russia - and they have maintained links with the government. Earlier this year, the Ministry of Youth and Sports earmarked 4 million hryvnias (about $150,000) to fund some of the youth camps among the dozens built by the nationalists. The purpose, according to the ministry, is \"national patriotic education.\"\n\nMinistry spokeswoman Natalia Vernigora said the money is distributed by a panel which looks for \"signs of xenophobia and discrimination, it doesn't analyze activities of specific groups.\"\n\nFelipe Dana / AP\n\nCherkashin is a veteran of the fight against pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine; he was wounded in combat and later came to lead Sokil, or Falcon, the youth wing of the Svoboda party. It is important, he says, to inculcate the nation's youth with nationalist thought, so they can battle Vladimir Putin's Russia as well as \"challenges that could completely destroy\" European civilization.\n\n\n\nAmong those challenges: LGBT rights, which lecturers denounce as a sign of Western decadence.\n\n\"You need to be aware of all that,\" said instructor Ruslan Andreiko. \"All those gender things, all those perversions of modern Bolsheviks who have come to power in Europe and now try to make all those LGBT things like gay pride parades part of the education system.\"\n\nWhile some youths dozed off during lectures, others paid attention. Clearly, some were receptive.\n\n\n\nDuring a break in training, a teenager played a nationalist march on his guitar.

Stumbling out of their tents, soldiers in training struggled to hold AK-47s that were, in some cases, almost as tall as they were. They were required to carry the heavy rifles all day, and one of the girls broke down in tears from exhaustion.\n\n\n\nAt 18, Mykhailo was the oldest of the campers.

He will be greatly missed.

But in his most famous role, he didn't even show his face.\n\nRain provided the voice in \"2001\" for the HAL 9000, a sentient computer controlling a spaceship bound for Jupiter. HAL can speak with the astronauts and follow their commands, and the computer calls itself \"incapable of error.\" But when the humans on board start questioning its performance, and consider shutting the system down, HAL finds ways to compute revenge.\n\nWith few characters and little dialogue in the film, HAL 9000 emerged as the most iconic \u2014 and the most human \u2014 figure in Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi epic. The character also turned out to be a precursor to AI devices that are now household items, like Alexa and Google Home.\n\nKubrick cast Rain for the role near the end of production, after scrapping other actors \u2014 including an Oscar winner, Martin Balsam \u2014 because he thought their voices were too distinctly American or British. Kubrick heard Rain's voice as the narrator of a 1960 space documentary, \"Universe,\" and thought his flat but formal delivery was exactly right.\n\n\"I think he's perfect,\" Kubrick said about Rain, according to Kate McQuiston's book \"We'll Meet Again: Musical Design in the Films of Stanley Kubrick.\" The director said Rain's voice had \"the intelligent friend next door quality, with a great deal of sincerity, and yet, I think, an arresting quality.\"\n\nBut Rain said he treated his immortal role as just another job. He recorded his lines without watching the footage or meeting any other actors, and he told The New York Times earlier this year that, 50 years after its release, he still hadn't seen \"2001.\" He also downplayed his work on the film, telling the Times, \"If you could have been a ghost at the recording you would have thought it was a load of rubbish.\"\n\nRain also voiced HAL 9000 in a sequel, \"2010: The Year We Make Contact,\" which came out in 1984 and was one of his final screen credits.\n\nEdgar Wright, the director of \"Baby Driver\" and \"Shaun of the Dead,\" wrote on Twitter that Rain delivered one of \"the best performances in film, with just his voice.\"", "Registered dietitian Wendy Lopez, of Food Heaven Made Easy, provides this delicious breakfast recipe.\n\n\"This frittata is ridiculously easy to prepare, and you can make it once and eat it for the whole week,\" Lopez writes. \"This dish is also a one-pot wonder, meaning there is less to clean up after you're done.\n\n\"For our busy bees who don't have 10 minutes to sit down and savor breakfast in the AM (because snooze is life), we got you.

But some of the Black Friday deals already announced this month should be avoided \"like the plague,\" according to online shopping expert Phil Dengler of BestBlackFriday.com. Other products can simply be found for less elsewhere. Here are some of Dengler's tips for Black Friday shoppers this year:\n\nAvoid Walmart's shipping fees...\n\nOnline shopping for orders under $35 are to be avoided at Walmart, given its main rivals are all offering free shipping with no minimum order size for Black Friday and the rest of the holiday season. Having to pay shipping fees \"is a quick way to kill an otherwise great Black Friday deal,\" Dengler wrote in a recent blog post. If your order is less than 35 bucks, \"shop confidently at Target, Best Buy and Amazon without having to worry or calculate added shipping charges,\" he advised.\n\n... but consider its Apple iPhone deals\n\nThat said, Walmart is the place to go for Apple iPhones. The retailer is offering a free $300 Walmart gift card with purchase and qualifying activation of an iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max or iPhone XR. In addition, Walmart is offering a free $400 Walmart gift card with purchase and qualifying activation of an iPhone 8, iPhone 8+ or iPhone XR.\n\nGiven the retailer sells a broad ranges of products, including electronics, pet supplies, auto parts and groceries, \"a gift card at Walmart is as close to cash as you are going to get,\" Dengler noted.\n\nMeanwhile, Target's gift card offers represent between $50 to $250 less than what Walmart offers for the same phone. \"This is one of the worst disparities for the same deal we have ever seen on Black Friday,\" Dengler offered.\n\nKohl's the spot for Xbox One S 1TB Minecraft Creators\n\nThe Xbox One S 1TB Minecraft Creators bundle is hot this year, and should be purchased at Kohl's, Dengler advised. Here's his math: Of Walmart, Best Buy and Target, it is Target that offers the best deal, for $199.99 plus a free $20 Target gift card. And while Kohl's offer is 99 cents more expensive than at Target, it come with a $60 in Kohl's cash. Hello, extra $39.\n\nTarget's $99 Google Home Hub: less than meets the eye\n\nTarget is offering the Google Home Hub for $99, a savings of $50 and 99 cents cheaper that what it costs at Best Buy. Still, Dengler recommends buying the Google Home Hub elsewhere for extra incentives offered at Best Buy, Walmart and Kohl's.\n\nBest Buy best for Samsung Galaxy Note9, S9 or S9+\n\nBest Buy is the best bet for buying the Samsung Galaxy Note9, S9 or S9+, since the retailer is offering a direct savings of $300 with qualified activation. Walmart and Target both make the offer with free $300 gift cards in their own brands. Given the discounts are the same, best to go with Best Buy's immediate discount as opposed to getting gift cards from the others, Dengler said.", "Fresh off winning a third term in the U.S. Senate last week, Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown says that it's possible he'll run for president in 2020.\n\nIn an interview with The Columbus Dispatch on Monday, Brown cautioned that \"we're not close to saying yes\" to a presidential run. However, his wife Connie Schultz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, tweeted the Dispatch article with a concise message: \"We're thinking about it.\"\n\nBrown told the paper that since winning reelection on Tuesday, he's been encouraged by many to run for president and said, \"[I]t's been kind of overwhelming.\"\n\nBrown won his race by 6 points in what was otherwise a tough night for Democrats in Ohio. His ability to win in the swing state, which went for President Trump in 2016, has attracted the attention of national Democrats eager to take back industrial states around the Great Lakes in 2020.\n\nMr. Trump's victories in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin were crucial to his success in 2016. President Barack Obama won all four states in 2008 and 2012, but Mr. Trump's wins there left Democrats worried that they would now trend Republican.\n\nThe midterm election results helped allay these concerns. But Democrats are still looking for a candidate who could move these states back into the blue column in a presidential year. In addition to Brown, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who overwhelmingly won reelection in Minnesota on Tuesday, is sometimes touted as a possible Democratic presidential contender.\n\n\"My first mission is to encourage people to start talking about [American workers] more, reaching out to people in the industrial Midwest,\" Brown told the Dispatch. \"We'll see later on about the presidential race.

Amy Bauernschmidt, the first woman in Navy history to hold the title of executive officer, or XO, of a nuclear aircraft carrier.\n\nAs the XO, Bauernschmidt is the second in command of the USS Abraham Lincoln, one of 11 U.S. aircraft carriers stationed around the world. Bauernschmidt manages the ship's day-to-day operations, so the commander can focus on strategy. She basically runs a floating city of 5,000 people \u2013 a city with a mission.\n\nAt 7:30 every morning, Bauernschmidt leads what she calls \"XO power hour.\" Bauernschmidt keeps an eye on the sailors as they clean their stations aboard the USS Lincoln.\n\nCBS News\n\nFour-and-a-half acres of sovereign U.S. territory, the warship is on the front lines of disaster relief, humanitarian crises and armed conflict.\n\n\"What does it mean that you are the executive officer of this carrier? Do you ever stop and think about that?\" CBS News correspondent Jan Crawford asked.\n\n\"Not usually because my days are really busy,\" Bauernschmidt said. \"It is incredibly humbling though. \u2026 I'm glad I'm busy every day because if you think about it too much, it can get a little daunting. So it's easier to just get in and do the work.\"\n\nThe Milwaukee native has been doing the work since her days in the U.S. Naval Academy. In 1994, during her senior year, Congress repealed the law preventing women from serving on combat ships or planes.\n\n\n\n\"That law absolutely changed my life,\" Bauernschmidt said. \"We were the first class that graduated knowing and feeling honored with the privilege to be able to go serve along the rest of our comrades in combat.\"\n\n\n\nBauernschmidt soon became a naval aviator. Through six deployments and beyond, she lives by a motto her mother instilled in her: Never pass up an opportunity to grow.\n\n\n\n\"There are a lot of times in life that you're a little nervous or afraid to do something, 'cause you think you're gonna fail. Well, so what? I mean\u2026 what's the worst that's gonna happen if I fail?\" Bauernschmidt said. \"You know, If you fail you get up and you may realize in that failure that what you're really meant to do is something else.\"\n\nIn an environment where a mistake can mean life or death, Bauernschmidt routinely spot checks the ship's systems, including the missiles. Despite the high stakes, the XO's leadership style is unique.\n\n\"How many times have you said 'awesome sauce' today?\" Crawford asked Bauernschmidt.\n\n\"A lot,\" Bauernschmidt said.\n\n\"That's not typically what you think of from a high-ranking Navy officer,\" Crawford said.\n\n\"You know, I think there's a time and a place for everything,\" Bauernschmidt said. \"There have been plenty of people that have seen me the opposite of the 'awesome sauce' side of the executive officer. And there is a time and a place for that. \u2026 I can make my point differently.\"\n\nAsked what it means to be the first female XO of a nuclear aircraft carrier, Bauernschmidt said it's taken her a while to get there.\n\n\"I hope that I'm a good leader and a mentor to both men and women in the service. But I've still a little uncomfortable with it, but I'm growing to appreciate the role and the fact that if you can see it, you know, you can believe it,\" Bauernschmidt said.\n\nSailor Jordan Gould is so inspired by the XO that, when she re-enlisted in the Navy last December, she asked Bauernschmidt to do the honors.\n\n\"I'm very proud to serve under her,\" Gould said. \"It was probably one of the best experiences of my life.\"\n\n\n\n\"And why did you want her to re-enlist you?\" Crawford asked her.\n\n\"I think it was because I can see a little bit of myself,\" she responded. \"It's okay to be assertive. It's okay to be in control.\"\n\n\"Your personal story really shows what it means to have women in these roles for other women,\" Crawford said.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Gould said.\n\n\n\nTo Bauernschmidt, service is \"contributing to something greater than yourself.\"\n\n\"For me, it is about supporting and defending the Constitution of the United States. But it's also about these young men and women that I lead every day,\" she said.\n\n\"That's a pretty awesome responsibility,\" Crawford said.\n\n\"They're pretty awesome,\" Bauernschmidt said.\n\nIn the new year, the XO will get a new assignment that puts her in the running to possibly become the first woman ever to command an aircraft carrier.\n\n\n\nWatch other Profiles in Service:", "It was announced Monday that Michelle Obama's new memoir, \"Becoming\" (published by Crown), is the latest selection of the Oprah Book Club. It's the 80th book to receive the coveted \"Oprah seal of approval.\"\n\nCBS News\n\n\"I got an advance copy of what everybody is calling 'the book of the season,'\" said Winfrey, \"and I loved it so much, I've already read it twice.\n\n\"It's a tour de force. I laughed and I cried. It is exquisitely written. It is so vulnerable, so vivid. I want the whole world to read this book, and if you're in a book club, I encourage you to choose this book for your club, and let's all read it together.\n\n\"It's Michelle Obama's personal story but I know it will spark you to think about your own becoming.\"\n\nThe book goes on sale Tuesday.\n\nIn a preview of her interview with Obama (to be broadcast in a primetime special on the OWN network on Thursday, November 15), Winfrey asked the former first lady about her remarks in the book about then-\"Apprentice\" host Donald Trump's provocative \"birther\" comments, suggesting that President Barack Obama, running for reelection, was not really an American citizen.\n\n\"Donald Trump, with his loud and reckless innuendos, was putting my family's safety at risk. And for this I'd never forgive him,\" Michelle Obama wrote.\n\nCrown\n\n\"Why was it important for you to say that at this time?\" Winfrey asked.\n\n\"Because I don't think he knew what he was doing,\" Obama said. \"That for him, it was a game.\n\n\"And for the Commander in Chief, which he now is, the threats and security risks that you face as the Commander in Chief, not even within your home country but around the world, are real. And your children are at risk. And the difference when you're now in that position [is], you understand that while you live in a bubble, your children have to live outside of the bubble. And in order for my children to have a normal life, even though they had security, they were in the world in a way that we weren't.\"\n\nMichelle Obama will also be interviewed by Gayle King on \"CBS This Morning\" on Wednesday, November 15.", "Former President George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush received the Liberty Medal on Sunday at the Constitution Center in Philadelphia for their work with veterans, reports CBS Philly. The award, in its 30th year, honors people for their commitment to veterans.\n\n\"It is not about Democrats or Republicans,\" said former Vice President Joe Biden, who presented the award. \"It's about who we are. It's about standing up for men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us every single day.\"\n\n\"We share a belief that those democratic values are precious, they exist above party, and they have to be defended\" Biden said. He also presented the Bushes with Philadelphia Eagles jerseys.\n\nA group of veterans protested the ceremony, blocking the entrance to the National Constitution Center. The group, Veterans Against the War, represents post-9/11 service members and veterans and seeks to end \"a foreign policy of permanent war and the use of military weapons, tactics and values in communities across the country,\" according to a statement.\n\nFormer recipients of the Liberty Medal award include John McCain, Hillary Clinton and Muhammad Ali.", "An epidemic of loneliness is sweeping the workplace, and it could be hurting job performance and loyalty.\n\nEmployees today spend half their day using technology to communicate, rather than relying on face-to-face or phone conversations, finds a new study from human resource advisory firm Future Workplace and Virgin Pulse, a company that works with businesses to improve employees' health.\n\nSlightly more than half of workers said they always or very often feel lonely as a result, according to the study, which is published in a new book called \"Back to Human: How Great Leaders Create Connection in the Age of Isolation\" by Future Workplace Research Director Dan Schawbel. The study interviewed over 2,000 managers and employees in 10 countries.\n\nThe ubiquity of technology in the workplace has helped millions of workers turn to telecommuting, a benefit that many employees crave because it cuts out travel time and provides more flexibility. But remote workers appear to be more likely to suffer from loneliness and disengagement, the study found.\n\n\"The illusion that we're hyperconnected\"\n\n\n\n\"Maybe we have gone too far -- we tap our devices constantly and are addicted to using alerts and texts,\" Schawbel said in an interview about the research and his new book. \"It creates the illusion that we're hyperconnected and have lot of friends, but your Facebook friend may not be a real friend.\"\n\nHe added, \"People talk about the upside, but no one talks about the dark side -- the isolation and loneliness from not having those connections.\"\n\nEmployers risk a downside, as well: Greater feelings of loneliness and disconnection can lead to lower engagement from employees. And those workers may be more likely to move on, the study found. For remote workers, that's even more true.\n\nAbout one-third of employees work remotely either occasionally or full-time, but two-thirds of them aren't engaged, the study found. More than 40 percent of remote workers said they believed more face time would help them build stronger relationships with their team. Those disconnected remote workers are more likely to quit than in-office workers, who tend to enjoy the benefit of seeing co-workers and engaging in face-to-face discussions, the study noted.\n\n\"If you work remote, you're less likely to stay with a company,\" Schawbel said. \"More people want to work remote, and more people are offering flexible work, not understanding it can have a big impact unless it's handled with care.\"\n\nWhat managers can do\n\n\n\nFor managers, that means acknowledging that managing remote workers takes skill and effort beyond simply relying on collaborative technologies like email, Schawbel wrote in \"Back to Human.\" He recommended that managers also need to reach out to their remote workers via phone, in-person visits and teleconferencing to help strengthen those interpersonal ties.\n\nIt's an issue that cuts close to home for Schawbel, who said he has been a remote worker for about eight years. The flexibility is great, but he said he also felt the challenges of making personal connections, leading him to rethink how he connects with clients and co-workers.\n\n\"We have four events every year, so I see clients in person -- and that makes a difference,\" he noted. \"If you don't see people in person, you're losing out.\"\n\nThe loneliest workers\n\nSome workers suffer more from loneliness and isolation than others, the study found. Worst off are men, introverts and younger workers, which Schawbel said reflects both societal changes and the challenges that face certain demographics.\n\nIntroverts, for instance, may not need as much external stimulation as extroverts, yet they still need human contact. And because they tend to like working independently, they may be more likely to dip into remote work -- leading to greater isolation.\n\n\"Introverts are more comfortable being independent and isolated, so we almost create our own isolation,\" said Schawbel, who identifies as an introvert. \"That's why we would rather work at home than at a co-working space. But that shouldn't be an excuse not to get coffee with someone or use videoconferencing to see someone.\"\n\nAlmost 60 percent of men are lonely at work, compared with slightly more than 40 percent of women, the study found. Men may be less likely to make emotional connections with others, including co-workers, Schawbel noted. Men tend to suffer from isolation as they get older -- and loneliness is a predictor for several health issues, even premature death.\n\nYounger workers are also more isolated, with almost half of millennials and Gen Z reporting loneliness in the workplace. By comparison, slightly more than one-third of Gen X workers said they were lonely, and only 29 percent of baby boomers reported feeling isolated in the workplace.\n\nYounger generations want \"meaningful work,\" Schawbel noted. That means belonging to a group or community that will support their ambitions, including in the workplace.\n\nSearching for connections\n\n\n\nManagers should pay attention to these feelings of isolation because low engagement may prompt workers to go on the job hunt. Sixty percent of those surveyed said they would be more likely to stay with their company longer if they had more workplace friends, the study found.\n\nCreating a welcoming experience for employees can help them cement relationships. That can range from assessing what motivates your employees and hiring for personality fit, as well as giving your office space a fresh assessment by asking workers what design changes might make it more welcoming, \"Back to Human\" recommends.\n\nCompanies that are listed as \"best places to work\" in various surveys are those \"that feel like a family,\" Schawbel noted. Workers and managers who don't examine how they interact with their co-workers \"might be thinking they're OK, because the tech is almost deceiving them. But the relationships become a little weaker as a result.\"", "The Woolsey and Hill Fires have been blazing through Southern California, forcing some residents to flee their homes and hope there will be something left when they come back. Actor Gerard Butler returned to his Malibu residence Sunday and posted a devastating photo showing it in ruins.\n\n\"Returned to my house in Malibu after evacuating. Heartbreaking time across California,\" wrote the \"300\" actor, including a photo of himself in front of a charred home and car.\n\nButler thanked the Los Angeles Fire Department saying,\"Inspired as ever by the courage, spirit and sacrifice of firefighters. Thank you @LosAngelesFireDepartment. If you can, support these brave men and women at SupportLAFD.org.

Half gone.\"\n\nAnother video shows the scene in the photo he posted, with the actor appearing shocked, stating \"Wow,\" and shaking his head.\n\nButler is not the only public figure who was forced to evacuate, with Lady Gaga and Kim Kardashian West \u2014 among others \u2014 posting about leaving their residences due to the fires.\n\nThe fast-moving \"Woolsey Fire\" began Thursday night and by Friday it prompted evacuations in Malibu, Calabasas and other nearby areas. In under two days, the \"Woolsey Fire\" and the \"Hill Fire\" have prompted evacuation orders for over 250,000 people.\n\nFirefighters also faced the \"Camp Fire\" in Northern California's Butte County that destroyed over 6,700 structures and is reported to be the most destructive fire in state history.\n\nThe wildfires burning in the northern and southern parts of the state have led to the deaths of at least 31 people.", "We take our music seriously at \"CBS This Morning.\" Keep up with the music we play on the broadcast by following our \"CBS This Morning\" Spotify playlist and checking CBSThisMorning.com for daily playlist posts.\n\n\"Shut Up And Drive\" \u2013 Rihanna\n\n\"Holiday\" \u2013 Green Day\n\n\"Physical\" \u2013 Olivia Newton-John\n\n\"The Way You Move\" \u2013 OutKast, Sleepy Brown\n\n\"Check Yo Self\" \u2013 Ice Cube\n\n\"The Wrong Year\" \u2013 The Decemberists\n\n\"Anna Sun\" \u2013 WALK THE MOON\n\n\"Pompeii\" \u2013 Bastille\n\n\"I Feel It All\" \u2013 Feist\n\n\"First\" \u2013 Cold War Kids\n\n\"Half The World Away\" \u2013 Oasis\n\n\"Smooth Sailin'\" \u2013 Leon Bridges\n\n\"Sorry\" \u2013 Justin Bieber\n\n\"breathin\" \u2013 Ariana Grande\n\n\"Sir Duke\" \u2013 Stevie Wonder\n\n\"Together Again\" \u2013 Janet Jackson\n\n\"(Nice to Meet You) Anyway\" \u2013 Gavin DeGraw\n\n\"Second Hand News\" \u2013 Fleetwood News\n\n\"Heartbreak Warfare\" \u2013 John Mayer", "A Wisconsin school district is investigating a photo showing a group of high school boys apparently making the Nazi salute.

While few candidates have announced, many likely contenders spent the 2018 campaign stumping and fundraising for candidates in the hopes of making their respective marks within the party. With so many Democrats expressing interest in taking on Trump, CBS has compiled a list of potential candidates and where they are staking their claim in what figures to be the most crowded field yet. The record year was 2016, when 17 major candidates vied for the GOP nomination.\n\nCBS News / James Morris\n\nSenate Scramble\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris\n\nThe first-term senator has seized her perch on the Judiciary Committee as a national platform, most notably during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when she asked, \"Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?\" Additionally, Harris spent much of the 2018 midterm election cycle campaigning for colleagues and building a network of candidates.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\n\nA former mayor of Newark, Booker is known for his social media savvy and attention-getting performances \u2014 most notably, his \"I am Spartacus\" moment at the Kavanaugh hearings. Booker has already been testing the waters in Iowa, and told reporters there recently that he wants to \"be a voice in this country for love.\" The primary process will test whether this approach matches or clashes with party voters' sentiments about the president.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\n\nKnown as a progressive darling, Warren has built the most extensive political network yet, reaching all 50 states. The senator has also shown, for better or for worse, a knack for going toe-to-toe with President Trump, releasing the results of a DNA test on any Native American ancestry and using Twitter to fire back at the president.\n\nNew York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand\n\nEasily re-elected in 2018, Gillibrand has developed a network to engage more women in politics through her Off the Sidelines PAC. She has also show she's not afraid to take on her own party \u2014 leading the charge to oust fellow Democrat Al Franken from the Senate over misconduct allegations and arguing last year that former President Bill Clinton should have resigned over the scandal involving Monica Lewinsky.\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar\n\nKlobuchar was overwhelmingly re-elected to a third term in November in a state Donald Trump came close to winning in 2016, and is a frequent guest at various state party gathers, including in early states. She was a prominent figure during the Kavanaugh hearing as one of the few women of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and earned acclaim within the party for her back and forth with the judge. Kavanaugh apologized to Klobuchar after responding harshly to her question about drinking, after she had detailed her father's alcoholism. Klobuchar is known for her \"Minnesota nice\" personality, but cut her chops as a Hennepin County prosecutor and has degrees from Yale and the University of Chicago.\n\nOregon Sen. Jeff Merkley\n\nPerhaps among the lesser known of this group, Merkley garnered national attention for being among the first politicians to visit a detention center at the southern border. When he was turned away by officials there, he streamed the experience in a Facebook video that went viral, and drew attention to the humanitarian crisis there spurred by the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy.\n\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown\n\nFresh off winning his Senate re-election bid last week, the Ohio Democrat says that it's possible he'll run for president in 2020. A liberal who can win in Trump country. Brown picked up his third term in a state the president won by eight points \u2014 on the same day voters there chose a Republican for governor. Known for his scratchy voice and disheveled look, Brown has carved out a niche for himself as a working class champion \u2014 and one whose views on trade policy and China are more in line with Trump than most traditional Republicans.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\n\nThe runner-up for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, Sanders has a vast grassroots network that has continued to work through the midterms. While many of Sanders' candidates foundered in the midterms, many of the policies he has championed \u2014 like \"Medicare for All\" and a federal minimum wage \u2014 have become policy mainstays in the party.\n\nThe Early Bird\n\nMaryland Rep. John Delaney\n\nWhile candidates usually play coy, Delaney blew past convention and announced his candidacy in July of 2017, just half a year into Trump's first year in office. Delaney, a wealthy former businessman, is still the the least known candidate, though he has made frequent trips to the early states and has endorsed local office candidates in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nThe Youths or The Young Guns\n\nCalifornia Rep. Eric Swalwell\n\nThe 37-year-old congressman is a familiar face on cable news, using his perch as a member of the House Intelligence Committee to challenge the president, and he has also become a prominent figures in the congressional investigation into Russian meddling and allegations of collusion.\n\nTexas Rep. Beto O'Rourke\n\nCould losing be winning when it comes to the Democratic presidential primary? The 46-year old El Paso lawmaker came within three points of winning a Senate seat in ruby red Texas, and raised over $38 million in the process. His candidacy inspired a nationwide Democratic obsession and garnered endorsements from the likes of Beyonce.\n\nMassachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton\n\nA former Marine Corps officer, the 40-year-old, two-term Moulton set out to create a green wave of military vets running for office in the 2018 cycle. He has also been critical of his party's leadership, calling for fresher faces to lead the party.\n\nRichard Ojeda\n\nThe West Virginia state senator and veteran of Army tours in Iraq and Afghanistan announced his 2020 on Monday, nearly a week after losing his bid to represent the 3rd Congressional District by a dozen points. Ojeda, who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, garnered national attention over the course of the 2018 cycle running as a Democrat in a state where the president is most popular. \"The President of the United States, Republicans and Democrats, have focused more on infighting, political wars, than they have focused on being there for the working class citizens,\" Ojeda said in a Facebook live post announcing his presidential bid.\n\nInterlopers\n\nMichael Avenatti\n\nThe attorney for adult film actress Stormy Daniels and a prolific cable news presence has made visits to early states and developed his own super PAC. Avenatti's style has irked fellow Democrats, particularly during the Kavanaugh hearings, but the attorney argues he's best positioned to play and beat Mr. Trump at his own game.\n\nHoward Schultz\n\nThe newly retired Starbucks CEO has inserted himself into political discourse, criticizing Mr. Trump's rhetoric. CNBC reports that Schultz is building a public relations team to help with the release of a new book and a possible presidential run. One member of that PR team is Steve Schmidt, who managed John McCain's 2008 presidential bid. Schmidt left the GOP in June and is a frequent critic of the president.\n\nBillionaires Club\n\nTom Steyer\n\nThe former hedge fund manager has long been involved in Democratic politics, and spent over $120 million on the midterms. He has found his niche in the field by leading the calls for Mr. Trump's impeachment. In an interview with CBSN, Steyer called for \"transformational leadership\" and someone \"who will not try to meet in the middle\" when it comes to a candidate for president. Steyer hasn't made up his mind about running, but said \"I promise I'm thinking of it really hard.\"\n\nMichael Bloomberg\n\nThe businessman and former New York City mayor spent over $110 million on the midterms, and has been an outspoken advocate for gun control. Bloomberg is a businessman who was elected mayor as a Republican and as an independent, and recently joined the Democratic Party. Bloomberg spoke at the Democratic National Convention in 2016, and drew attention for saying of Mr. Trump, \"I'm a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one.\"\n\nStatesmen\n\nColorado Gov. John Hickenlooper\n\nThe Colorado governor and former businessman is leaving office in January, but is openly talking about his 2020 prospects, telling reporters in New Hampshire recently that he was \"leaning strongly\" towards running. Hickenlooper has been twice elected in a purple state critical to winning the presidency. He signed gun control measures in Colorado that were met with backlash there, but could be appealing among Democratic primary voters.\n\nMontana Gov. Steve Bullock\n\nThe Montana governor has a proven ability to win in a red state, having been re-elected by four points in 2016 when Trump carried the state by over 20 points. Bullock was elected to lead the National Governors Association, which helps him build a network of office holders and donors. The governor would be seen as a moderate force in a Democratic primary, but has also voiced support for tougher gun laws, including an assault weapons ban.\n\nFormer Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe\n\nHaving served as governor of Virginia and chairman of the DNC, the longtime friend of the Clintons has built a critical fundraising network around the country. McAuliffe campaigned for candidates in the 2018 midterms, including in the first caucus state of Iowa. He touts economic developments and low unemployment in Virginia as a calling card. He pushed for Medicaid expansion in his state, though it met resistance in the GOP legislature, and moved to restore voting rights to felons.\n\nFormer Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick\n\nThe former Massachusetts governor is being forced to defend his current position with the private equity firm Bain Capital, and could raise problems with Democratic primary voters who have shown a resistance to Wall Street. \"I've never taken a job where I've left my conscious at the door and I haven't started now,\" he said on CNN over the summer. Patrick, who was appointed by President Clinton to oversee the civil rights division at the Justice Department, is popular among former Obama officials. But he has also told former Obama adviser David Axelrod that \"I'm not sure there is a place for me\" in the crowded Democratic primary field.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\n\nThe New York governor, and son of Mario Cuomo, soundly won his primary against Cynthia Nixon in September and was easily reelected to a third term in November. Cuomo ruled out a presidential run during a debate with Nixon, pledging to serve a full term if elected. But the governor has proposed legislation like free college tuition for middle and low income families, and that would be appealing to Democratic primary voters.\n\nCity Slickers\n\nFormer New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu\n\nA southern Democrat from a prominent political family, the former mayor of New Orleans could appeal to voters seeing a moderate force in the party to be successful in a general election. Landrieu wrote a book this year titled \"In the Shadow of Statues: A White Southerner Confronts History\" in which he describes his decision to remove four confederate statues in his city, a decision that gained national attention as the then-mayor confronted the difficult issues of race and division.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti\n\nThe mayor of Los Angeles has been a frequent traveler to early caucus and primary states, making no secret of his interest in running for president in 2020. Jewish and also of Mexican descent (and the son of former district attorney Gil Garcetti, who prosecuted OJ Simpson), Garcetti sees opportunity in the Democratic Party's diversity, and he considers his management of the country's second largest city to be his calling card.\n\nFormer San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro\n\nThe former mayor of San Antonio and Housing and Urban Development secretary in the Obama administration has been considered a rising star in the party ever since he was tapped to speak at the Democratic National Convention in 2012. He has traveled to early states and recently published a biography and has said he is \"likely\" to run in 2020.\n\nObama 2.0\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\n\nThe former vice president tops early polling of the 2020 field and has been traveling around the country over the past few months campaigning for Democratic candidates in the midterm. After sitting 2016 out, Biden told CBS This Morning that \"I think about whether or not I should run based on very private decisions relating to my family and the loss of my son and what I want to do with the rest of my life...I think people are going to judge it, if I were to run. I think they're gonna judge me on my vitality.\"\n\nFormer Attorney General Eric Holder\n\nThe former attorney general garnered national controversy for his \"When they go low, we kick 'em\" remark and has been a top opponent for Republican lawmakers. But the Obama alum has also been visiting early states and has made gerrymandering reform a top priority since leaving the Justice Department.\n\nA League of Her Own\n\nOprah\n\nOprah Winfrey went door-to-door campaigning for gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams earlier this month, but has continued to pour cold water over her own political aspirations. Oprah piqued interest with a stirring speech at the Golden Globes in January.

As part of his 24K Magic World Tour, the singer will be bringing a bit of magic to his home state of Hawaii.\n\nHe'll be providing Thanksgiving meals for 24,000 in need, The Associated Press reports.\n\nThe nine-time Grammy winner donated money for the food to the Salvation Army's Hawaiian and Pacific Islands Division, he announced Sunday. The holiday meal program is an annual event hosted by the Salvation Army. Hawaii has one of the nation's highest homelessness rates.\n\nMars stopped at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu last week, performing for three nights in a row. \"Let's show love and aloha to everyone driving down and attending the concert,\" the Hawaii native posted on Instagram ahead of his first show on Friday. \"I've missed you all and I can't wait to perform and sing on the island I call home.\"\n\nThe performer's 200-date tour is in support of his multi-platinum 2016 album, \"24K Magic,\" which won six Grammy Awards earlier this year.", "", "A soldier says a stranger's Christmas card got him through Vietnam.

Beginning today, its leadership responsibilities fall to Dr. Leana Wen, who takes over as the organization's new president.\n\nDr. Wen, who was Baltimore's health commissioner, is a practicing emergency room physician and mother of a 14-month-old. She's the first doctor to lead Planned Parenthood in half a century. Appearing on \"CBS This Morning\" Monday, she said the organization's mission is \"deeply personal\" to her.\n\n\"I was a patient of Planned Parenthood, and so was my mother and my sister, just like one in five women in America,\" she said \"When we first came to this country, my mother didn't have health care anywhere else. And Planned Parenthood was there for her, just like it's there for women across the country, to provide cancer screenings, to provide birth control.\"\n\nCBS News\n\nNow she has the perspective of a doctor as well as a patient.\n\n\"For me, it's deeply personal. I treated a woman who waited more than a year before she had a lump in her breast examined. And by the time she got treated, it was too late. She had metastatic cancer and she died not long after I saw her, leaving behind three young children.\n\n\"For me, that's what it's about. It's about saving people's lives. That's the work that we've done at Planned Parenthood for over 100 years. And I'm proud to keep on providing health care and protecting access to that care.\"\n\nWen was asked if she had any trepidation about taking the job, since Planned Parenthood has come under attack by anti-abortion activists. \"Being a parent has clarified my values,\" she said. \"And what I want to do is to shape the future for my son, Eli. And it's a future where all people are treated the same, that all people have the right to health care, and where it's a society where we trust women and we trust all people to make the best decisions for themselves and their bodies.\"\n\n\"Were you encouraged after the [midterm] elections?\" asked co-host Gayle King.\n\n\"Yes and no. On the one hand, we saw people \u2013 women, people of color \u2013 rise up to speak in favor of reproductive rights and access to health care. But on the other hand, less than 24 hours after the election, the Trump administration came out with new rules that would allow employers to deny women birth control coverage.\n\n\"I can't believe it's 2018 and we're still debating birth control. Imagine if we're having the same conversation about vasectomies or about insulin. Women's health care is health care, and health care shouldn't be political.\n\nCo-host John Dickerson asked, \"You said becoming a mother clarified your values. So many people I've talked to who want to restrict abortion rights said parenthood clarified their values, and that's why they want to restrict abortion rights. What do you tell those people who have the same parent-based authenticity to their beliefs that you claim?\"\n\n\"I respect each person's beliefs for themselves; my problem is if they want to impose their own beliefs on other people,\" Wen said. \"As a physician, I trust my patients. My job is to give medically accurate information to my patients and allow them to make the best choices about their health. I don't think that politicians have any role to play in the exam room in determining people's personal medical decisions. I trust women.\"\n\nCo-host Norah O'Donnell also asked about last week's election results, which saw seven pro-reproductive rights candidates elected as governors, but also anti-abortion measures passed in Alabama and West Virginia.\n\nThough she admitted seeing mixed results, Wen was positive: \"We are seeing people rise up in record numbers in favor of women's health care. We have more than 25 governors now who are pro-women's health. We're also seeing solidly red states, like Utah, Idaho, and Nebraska, vote in favor of Medicaid expansion, which indicates that people want more health care, not less. I strongly believe the position that health care has to be a human right, and women's health care is health care.\"\n\nWhen asked if she would characterize talk that Roe v. Wade may be overturned as hyperbole, Wen described seeing a real threat. \"There's a very high likelihood that Roe v. Wade could be overturned in this Supreme Court, which would leave 25 million women \u2013 which is a third of women of reproductive age in this country \u2013 without access to reproductive rights.\n\n\"There are 15 cases right now that are just one step away from the Supreme Court. And in the last seven years there have been 400 laws passed in different states that directly restrict women's access. And I'm deeply concerned about this from a public health perspective.\"", "The vast majority of baby boomers haven't accumulated enough savings to fully retire at age 65 with their preretirement standard of living. That's the sobering conclusion of recent studies from both the Stanford Center on Longevity and HR consulting firm Aon.\n\nAs a result, boomers will need to either work longer, reduce their standard of living in retirement or do some combination of the two. In addition, it's critical that they squeeze the most from their modest financial resources.\n\nThat means baby boomers have to make some choices. Following are the top five retirement planning decisions that will have the biggest impact on most older workers' financial security. If you're in this category, you'll need to determine:\n\nWhen and how to retire (including whether to work part-time for a while) When to start taking Social Security benefits How to build your retirement income portfolio, including deploying retirement savings and, for the lucky few, any pension benefits What choices to make regarding Medicare Which living expenses\n\nFive scenarios\n\n\n\nLet's consider one example that illustrates the power of the first three choices. We'll look at a married couple, both age 62, who have $350,000 in retirement savings (which, by the way, is above the average savings amount for similar older workers). Let's consider the following five scenarios regarding decisions they can make:\n\nRetire at age 62, immediately start collecting Social Security and begin drawing down retirement savings Implement a downshifting strategy by working part-time, just enough to cover living expenses but with no additional contributions to savings, then start Social Security and savings drawdown at age 66 Work full-time until age 66, while continuing to add to savings, then starting Social Security and savings drawdown Downshift until age 70, then start Social Security and savings drawdown Work full-time until age 70, then start Social Security and savings drawdown\n\nThe graph below shows the estimated annual retirement income for each of these scenarios (by my calculations).\n\nHere are a few key conclusions we can draw from this graph:\n\nThere's a large difference between retiring at age 62, with a total estimated retirement income of $42,586, and retiring at age 70, with a total estimated retirement income of $73,167. As a result, the period between age 62 and 70 is the \"retirement opportunity zone.\" Decisions about working and retiring during this time can make a major impact on your retirement security.\n\nCompare Scenarios 2 and 3 -- downshifting between ages 62 and 66 and working full-time during that period. These two scenarios don't show a large difference in retirement income. Therefore, older workers who want to free up some time to enjoy their lives might want to consider downshifting, if they have the capability\n\nSocial Security benefits protect against inflation risk, investment risk, longevity risk, cognitive decline and death of a spouse. The graph illustrates that Social Security contributes the largest portion of most workers' retirement benefits. That's why it's important to optimize your benefits\n\nAny volatility in retirement income introduced by stock market investing is concentrated in the relatively small light-green portions of the graph. This might give retirees insights about the amount of their retirement savings they might invest in stocks.\n\nYour retirement planning job\n\n\n\nA big part of your retirement planning job is to learn as much as you can about generating income after you stop working and to understand the implications of when and how you should retire. You might want to prepare your own version of the above graph or find a qualified financial adviser who can help you with this analysis.\n\nMy latest book, \"Retirement Game-Changers: Strategies for a Healthy, Financially Secure, and Fulfilling Long Life,\" goes into more detail on the advantages and issues for a downshifting strategy, as well as other key decisions facing older workers as they transition into retirement.\n\nEither way, it would be wise to spend some time learning about the choices you should be making during your own retirement opportunity zone.", "", "Stepping up Democratic efforts to shield the Russia investigation, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would seek to tie a measure protecting special counsel Robert Mueller to must-pass legislation if acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker does not recuse himself from oversight of the probe.\n\n\"Democrats in the House and Senate are going to attempt to put on must-pass legislation, mainly the spending bill, legislation that would prevent Whitaker from interfering in any way with the Mueller investigation,\" Schumer told The Associated Press Sunday.\n\nSchumer said keeping Whitaker in charge of the investigation would create a \"constitutional crisis\" and said if he doesn't recuse himself, Democrats would push to introduce legislation to protect Mueller's investigation.\n\nSchumer sent a letter to the Justice Department on Sunday along with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats that calls for Lee Lofthus, an assistant attorney general and the department's chief ethics officer, to disclose whether he had advised Whitaker to recuse himself from oversight of the probe.\n\nThe Democrats cited Whitaker's past public statements, which have included an op-ed article in which he said Mueller would be straying outside his mandate if he investigated President Donald Trump's family finances. In a talk-radio interview he maintained there was no evidence of collusion between the Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\nThe letter to the Justice Department asked Lofthus to explain his reasoning for any recommendation he made to Whitaker regarding recusal and to provide all ethics guidance provided to the acting attorney general.\n\nWhitaker, a Republican Party loyalist and chief of staff to just-ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was elevated Wednesday after Trump forced Sessions out.\n\nWhitaker has faced pressure from Democrats to recuse himself from overseeing Mueller based on the comments, which were made before he joined the Justice Department last year. He has also tweeted an ex-prosecutor's opinion piece that described a \"Mueller lynch mob,\" which he said was \"worth a read.\"\n\n\"Let's face it, Whitaker is already biased,\" Schumer said. \"He has already talked about ways to strangle the Mueller investigation, such as cutting off their funding.\"\n\nThe Mueller protection bill would give any special counsel a 10-day window to seek review of a firing and ensure that the person was fired for good cause.\n\nIt's unclear if Republicans would agree to add the bill to the spending legislation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said there is no need for it, but other Republicans, like Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, have called for the bill since Whitaker was appointed.\n\nOn \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said legislation to shield Mueller from removal was \"unconstitutional.\" And Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said on \"Face the Nation\" that he talked to Whitaker last week and plans to meet with him this week, and he shouldn't have to remove himself from the probe. \"I am confident the Mueller investigation will be allowed to come to a good solid conclusion, that there'll be no political influence put on Mr. Mueller by Mr. Whitaker to do anything other than Mr. Mueller's job. I'm confident that Mr. Mueller will be allowed to do his job without interference.\"\n\nSchumer declined to say whether Democrats would be willing to force a government shutdown if Congress did not pass a measure protecting Mueller suggesting it wouldn't come to that because of bipartisan support. \"There's no reason we shouldn't add this and avoid a constitutional crisis,\" he told CNN's State of the Union. \"If that doesn't happen, we will see what happens down the road.\"\n\nThe bipartisan Mueller legislation was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in April and was co-sponsored by Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Thom Tillis of North Carolina.\n\nRep.

In terms of the omega 3s, the best thing to do is to try to have more dietary fish,\" Manson said. \"If people aren't going to eat fish, there really may be some benefits from taking a fish oil supplement. We recommend they discuss that with their health care provider.\"\n\nResults from both clinical trials were to be presented Saturday at the American Heart Association's annual meeting, in Chicago, and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFor the VITAL trial, nearly 26,000 U.S. men and women aged 50 and older were randomly assigned to take 1 gram of fish oil or 2,000 International Units of vitamin D daily, or a placebo. Participants had no history of heart problems.\n\nThe fish oil supplements reduced risk of heart attack by 28 percent over a five-year follow-up period, but they did not affect a person's risk of stroke or cancer, researchers found.\n\n\"The lower risk of heart attack was found particularly in those who have low fish consumption,\" Manson said. \"That group had 19 percent reduction in all major cardiovascular events, plus they had a 40 percent reduction in heart attack.\"\n\nVITAL also found overwhelming benefit of fish oil supplements for black participants, who had a 77 percent reduction in their risk of heart attack.\n\n\"If that can be confirmed in a follow-up study, then it could point to a very promising approach to reducing a health disparity,\" Manson said. Blacks tend to have a greater risk of heart disease than whites and other racial groups.\n\nThe clinical trial found no heart health benefit from vitamin D, although it did reduce the risk of cancer death by 25 percent.\n\nDr. Satjit Bhusri is a cardiologist with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"This is a very important and impressive trial. Its results will have a lasting change in the prevention of heart disease,\" said Bhusri, who was not involved with the studies. \"A reduction in heart attacks this profound has not seen been since in primary prevention since the early trials of aspirin therapy.\"\n\nIn the REDUCE-IT trial, another research team at Brigham and Women's Hospital tested the benefits of a pure and stable form of the omega-3 fatty acid known as EPA.\n\nThe supplement, icosapent ethyl, is a prescription medication approved to reduce triglyceride levels in people with high cholesterol.\n\nREDUCE-IT included more than 8,000 patients taking statins to lower their cholesterol and prevent either a first or repeat heart attack or stroke. About 7 in 10 patients in the study had hardened arteries, while the rest had diabetes and at least one other heart risk factor.\n\nPeople taking icosapent ethyl had a 20 percent reduction in their risk of heart-related death, a 31 percent reduction in heart attack and a 28 percent reduction in stroke, compared to those given a placebo, researchers found.\n\n\"The REDUCE-IT trial sets a new standard of care for patients who have elevated triglycerides and are at increased cardiovascular risk despite statin therapy,\" lead researcher Dr. Deepak Bhatt, executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said in hospital news release. \"This may be the biggest development in cardiovascular prevention since statins.\"\n\nThere are many ways that omega-3 fatty acids could help heart health, Manson said. They are known to lower triglyceride levels, reduce inflammation, decrease blood clotting and help stabilize heart rhythm.\n\nPeople interested in taking fish oil supplements should discuss it with their doctor first, said Dr. Helene Glassberg, an associate professor of clinical cardiovascular medicine at the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Medicine. She was not involved with the studies.\n\n\"It does have a blood-thinning effect. If you are on blood thinners, this may not be for you,\" Glassberg said.\n\nGlassberg and Manson agree that the best first step would be to increase fish in your diet. Eating at least two servings a week would be good, Manson said.\n\nFor someone who's healthy but looking to prevent heart disease, \"still at the top of my list is lifestyle,\" Glassberg said. \"Get it in your diet if you can, from omega-3 fatty fish like salmon or sardines. That's the place to start because these are natural. This is the best way to get it and not spend $30 on a bottle of supplements at a health food store.\"", "", "", "", "A singing nurse at Bronson Hospital in Kalamazoo, Michigan, helped light up a man's life in a remarkable way. When nurse Brenda Buurstra learned one of her patients liked the song \"You Light Up My Life\" by Debby Boone, she started to sing it to him. One week later, he was discharged from hospice care.\n\nBuurstra has been lighting up the lives of patients for more than a decade. \"I have sung to patients for 14 years, and this is just the first time I got caught,\" Buurstra told CBS affiliate WWMT. She was \"caught\" by Roberta Lytle, whose dad was admitted to the hospital last month.\n\nLytle's dad Robert Olson was having trouble breathing. She said her dad has always been strong -- he didn't retire until he was 85 years old. But this time, the family knew it was different, and he was put in hospice care.\n\n\"He has heart problems but because of his age, they can't put a pacemaker in,\" Lytle told WMMT. \"He had an episode at the house, and he couldn't breathe. So they took him to Bronson Hospital. He was there about a week. We did not think he was coming home this time.\"\n\nLytle said it was tough for her father to even speak just a few words at a time. Then Buurstra walked in. Not only did the nurse get Olson speaking, but singing.\n\n\"We were watching a show on Pat Boone, and he told the nurse 'I don't like him, but I like a song that his daughter sings.' And this lady just starts singing,\" Lytle said of Buurstra. \"And I'm just blown away. Because the woman's got a voice.\"\n\n\"He said, 'My favorite song is \"You Light Up My Life\".' And I just started singing it,\" Buurstra told the station.\n\nShe didn't know all the words, so she promised to print out the lyrics and come back the next day to sing to some more. Sure enough, she did. \"He was beaming,\" Buurstra said. \"Even through his little venting mask he was wearing, his eyes lit up. His whole countenance changed, and he had a big smile. You could tell that song lit him up. Literally 'You Light Up My Life,' that song really just lit him up. You could tell it touched his heart.\"\n\nLytle took a video of her dad singing with the nurse and posted the heartwarming moment on YouTube. \"If you listen to the video, you can hear him trying to sing at the very end. But it changed him. It was like he knew he was going to go home,\" Lytle said.\n\nJust one week later, Olson had regained enough strength to be discharged from the hospital. Once in hospice care, he was now going home.\n\nBuurstra said she's been singing to patients since she began her medical career. She started signing 17 years ago in church.\n\nShe said being a nurse is about a lot more than just caring for a patients' medical needs: \"Not just taking care of the illness in a patient; to touch them. To touch their life. To touch their heart.\"\n\n\"To make that awful hospital stay they're going through just a little bit better, a little bit brighter,\" Buurstra said. \"I wanted to be on a team of positive people, and that's what we have here at Bronson. I'm not the only nurse who goes above and beyond at Bronson. This is what we do every day.\"\n\n\"I just hope this woman knows what she's done for my dad,\" Lytle said. \"I just hope Bronson Hospital knows what they have in her.\"\n\nAs the song goes, she lit up his life and she gave him hope to carry on.

But there are plenty of differences between New York's Long Island City and Crystal City in northern Virginia.\n\nSet within eyeshot of the nation's capital, Crystal City is a thicket of 1980s-era office towers trying to plug into new economic energy after thousands of federal jobs moved elsewhere.\n\nRapidly growing Long Island City is an old manufacturing area already being reinvented as a hub for 21st-century industry, creativity and urbane living.\n\nSeattle-based Amazon, which set out last year to situate one additional headquarters but now may reportedly open two, has declined to comment on its plans. But people familiar with the talks said this week that Long Island City and Crystal City have emerged as front runners for the \"HQ2\" project and its total of 50,000 jobs. Here's a look at the two communities.\n\nLONG ISLAND CITY: PUMP UP THE VOLUME\n\nIt's already the fastest-developing neighborhood in the nation's most populous city, and Amazon could pump up the volume in this buzzy part of Queens.\n\nIf chosen, the neighborhood stands to burnish New York City's reputation as a tech capital. Landing Amazon would also cement Long Island City's transformation from a faded manufacturing zone to a vibrant, of-the-moment enclave of waterfront skyscrapers, modernized warehouses and artsy-tech ambiance across the East River from midtown Manhattan.\n\n\"I joke that we're experiencing explosive growth 30 years in the making,\" says Elizabeth Lusskin, president of the Long Island City Partnership, a neighborhood development group.\n\nBut Long Island City also has been straining to handle its growth.\n\nDays before the potential Amazon news emerged, the city announced a $180 million plan to address Long Island City's packed schools, street design and a sewage system that groans in heavy rain. But those projects will just catch up with current needs, says area City Councilman Jimmy van Bramer.\n\n\"I know that there are a lot of people cheerleading for this, but HQ2 has to work for Queens and the people of Queens. It can't just be good for Amazon,\" says van Bramer, a Democrat.\n\nOnce a bustling factory and freight-moving area, Long Island City saw many of its plants and warehouses closed as manufacturing shriveled in New York City.\n\nThe neighborhood's rebirth began in the 1980s, when officials broached redeveloping a swath of the waterfront, while artists were drawn by warehouse spaces, affordable rents and a building that is now the MoMA PS1 museum. Silvercup Studios \u2014 where such TV shows as \"Sex and the City,\" ''30 Rock\" and \"The Sopranos\" have been filmed \u2014 opened in 1983.\n\nLong Island City gained a new commercial stature, and the start of a high-rise skyline, when the banking giant now called Citi opened an office tower there in 1989. But the area's growth lately has been driven by residential building.\n\nSome 9,150 new apartments and homes have been built since 2010, more than in any other New York City neighborhood, according to the city Planning Department . Thousands more units are in the works.\n\nNew York has striven for nearly a decade to position itself as a tech hotspot.\n\nVenture capitalists poured $5.8 billion into New York-area startups last quarter, more than any other region except the San Francisco area, according to the consulting and accounting firm PwC . Established tech giants, including Google and Facebook, have been expanding their New York footprints.\n\nStill, landing HQ2 would represent \"incredible validation of just how far New York has come,\" says Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the Center for an Urban Future think tank.\n\nWaiting for a subway, Long Island City community board chairwoman Denise Keehan-Smith could envision Amazon benefiting the neighborhood.\n\n\"But I think we have to be careful about it,\" she said.\n\nCRYSTAL CITY: TUNNEL VISION\n\nIf any place in America can absorb 25,000 Amazon jobs without disruption, it may well be Crystal City, Virginia, where nearly that many jobs have vanished over the last 15 years.\n\nThe neighborhood in Arlington County is bounded by the Potomac River and the nation's capital on one side, by the Pentagon on another and Reagan National Airport on a third.\n\nDespite its prime location and abundant transportation options, the neighborhood has been hit by a massive outflow of jobs. The Patent and Trademark Office began moving more than 7,000 jobs out of Crystal City in 2003. In 2005, the Defense Department announced plans to move roughly 17,000 jobs elsewhere as part of a base realignment.\n\nArlington County has worked hard to bring in new employers, and had some success. The Public Broadcasting Service moved its headquarters to Crystal City in 2006.\n\nStill, large swaths of the neighborhood remain vacant. Among other challenges, the area has fought to overcome a reputation for outdated architecture.\n\nCrystal City is populated by '70s and '80s-era office buildings. The buildings are connected by a network of tunnels populated with food-court style dining options, hair salons and newsstands. The tunnels leave the ground-level outdoor streetscape sometimes looking empty.\n\nBrookings Institution urban planner Jenny Schuetz suggested the buildings may require an upgrade, or even replacement. But she noted that while people often associate tech companies with converted lofts or state-of-the art workspaces, many big Silicon Valley tech companies actually work out of '80s-era office buildings.\n\nFor all the talk about antiquated architecture, people who've actually worked in Crystal City appreciate its convenience and its worker-friendly features, including the tunnels.\n\n\"I loved it here,\" said Christine Gentry of Greenbelt, Maryland, as she ate breakfast in a largely empty food court. She works for the Patent and Trademark Office and preferred the days when her office was in Crystal City.\n\n\"Everything is accessible here,\" she said. \"When it was raining or snowing or sleeting, I never had to go out.\"\n\nPerhaps no place better illustrates the vibe of Crystal City than the region's only revolving restaurant, the Skydome atop the Doubletree Crystal City. Diners enjoy a panoramic view of the D.C. skyline, completing a full rotation every 47 minutes.\n\nSam Getachew, the hotel's food and beverage manager, said the restaurant fits the neighborhood's retro atmosphere.\n\n\"It's huge draw,\" Getchew said. \"People come for the curiosity of it.\"\n\nThe only downside, he said, is that \"when customers get up to go to the restroom, they don't know where they are when they come back.\"", "", "", "In the face of criticism raised against President Donald Trump's pick to fill the seat of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana advocated patience with Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, given that he is a short-term appointment. After firing Sessions last week, Mr. Trump ignored the line of succession at the Justice Department and appointed Whitaker, who was a former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa, a cable news pundit, and a vocal critic of the Special Counsel's investigation into Russian interference in U.S. elections.\n\nWhitaker, who has not been confirmed by the Senate, has taken the position amid criticism of his qualifications, his impartiality, and his resume, including his role in a Florida patent company that was fined nearly $26 million for defrauding customers.\n\nCBS News\n\n\"CBS This Morning\" co-host John Dickerson asked Kennedy, \"What is your view about the fact that [Whitaker] is not a Senate-confirmed person?\"\n\n\"I think he will be there for a short while,\" Kennedy replied. \"I think the president will very shortly announce a permanent nominee.

John Kennedy next week on \"CBS This Morning.\"", "Pabst Brewing Company and MillerCoors are heading to trial, with hipster favorite Pabst contending that MillerCoors aims to put it out of business by ending a long-term partnership through which it brews Pabst's beers.\n\nThe case has high stakes for Pabst, whose lawyers argue that the company's very existence relies on the partnership with Chicago-based MillerCoors, which produces, packages and ships nearly all its products, which include Pabst Blue Ribbon, Old Milwaukee, Natty Boh and Lone Star. MillerCoors, meanwhile, says it's not obligated to continue brewing for Pabst and that Pabst doesn't want to pay enough to justify doing so.\n\nThe trial in Milwaukee County Circuit Court begins Monday and is scheduled through Nov. 30.\n\nPabst's attorneys have said in court documents and hearings that MillerCoors LLC is lying about its brewing capacity to break away from Pabst and capture its share of the cheap beer market by disrupting Pabst's ability to compete. At a March hearing in which MillerCoors tried to have the lawsuit dismissed, Pabst attorney Adam Paris said \"stunning documents\" obtained from MillerCoors show that it went as far as hiring a consultant to \"figure out ways to get rid of us.\" MillerCoors has called that a mischaracterization of the consultant's work.\n\nThe 1999 agreement between MillerCoors and Pabst, which was founded in Milwaukee in 1844 but is now headquartered in Los Angeles, expires in 2020 but provides for two possible five-year extensions. The companies dispute how the extensions should be negotiated: MillerCoors argues that it has sole discretion to determine whether it can continue brewing for Pabst, whereas Pabst says the companies must work \"in good faith\" to find a solution if Pabst wants to extend the agreement but MillerCoors lacks the capacity.\n\nPabst needs 4 million to 4.5 million barrels brewed annually and claims MillerCoors is its only option. It is seeking more than $400 million in damages and for MillerCoors to be ordered to honor its contract.\n\nDuring 2015 negotiations about extending the contract, MillerCoors announced it would close its brewing facility in Eden, North Carolina, and that it eventually might have to shutter another facility in Irwindale, California. Pabst contends that MillerCoors refused to provide any information to substantiate its claim that it would no longer have the capacity to continue brewing Pabst's beers, and that it wouldn't consider leasing the Eden facility and would only sell it for an \"astronomical\" price.\n\nPabst says MillerCoors wouldn't agree to an extension unless Pabst paid $45 per barrel \u2014 \"a commercially devastating, near-triple price increase\" from what it pays now. At the March hearing, Paris said MillerCoors knew Pabst couldn't accept that proposal \"because it would have bankrupted us three times over.\"\n\nIn court filings, MillersCoors said Pabst's proposals to keep the Eden facility open \"were commercially unreasonable\" and that Pabst sought \"a windfall through litigation\" instead of offering to pay enough to keep a facility open. It also said the facility's closing was \"to ensure the longer-term sustainability\" of MillerCoors because thousands of new brewers have entered the market over the past decade.\n\nMillerCoors and Anheuser-Busch, which have the biggest U.S. market share at 24.8 percent and 41.6 percent, respectively, have been losing business to smaller independent brewers, imports, and wine and spirits in recent years, according to the Brewers Association.\n\n\"The beer market has shifted and beer lovers are increasingly demanding more variety, fuller-flavor, and local products from small and independent producers,\" said Bart Watson, the Brewers Association's chief economist.\n\nOverall U.S. beer sales have declined, with shipments down from 213.1 million barrels in 2008 to 204.2 million in 2017, according to the Brewers Association.\n\nPabst depends on MillerCoors because the only other U.S. brewer with capacity to make its products is Anheuser-Busch, which doesn't do contract brewing, Paris said.\n\n\"It really is an existential issue for Pabst because it has no real alternatives,\" Paris said at the March hearing.\n\nParis said the report from the consultant MillerCoors hired in 2013 proves the company never intended to act in good faith. Pabst's attorneys say the report had sections focused on how to \"eliminate Pabst altogether\" and noted that MillerCoors would need to close two breweries \"to be sure they don't have excess capacity for contract manufacturing.\"\n\nMillerCoors' attorney, Eric Van Vugt, said in court that the company didn't rely on the consultant's report when it decided to close Eden or when it has contemplated closing the Irwindale brewery.\n\n\"If we keep Irwindale open, yes, we can supply their beer,\" Van Vugt said. \"No one disputes that. That's the only factor that we need to look at.\"", "", "", "bad url", "The federal government unveiled new, updated guidelines for physical activity on Monday. The recommendations aim to help fight the obesity epidemic that affects nearly 40 percent of American adults and adds nearly $117 billion to health care costs.\n\nIt's been 10 years since the first physical activity guidelines were issued, and the updated guidelines for adults allow more flexibility, counting short bursts of exercise and activity such as housework into the recommended weekly total of 150 minutes.\n\nThe report said physical activity reduces the risk of eight types of cancer, up from two in the previous guidelines. For the first time, the government is adding recommendations for 3- to 5-year-olds, reports CBS News' Dr. Tara Narula.\n\nSome preschoolers start their day on the run to condition their bodies and their minds.\n\n\"You need to run around. You need to get the energy out, and they actually then focus and somehow regroup and they can actually be more effective in class,\" mother Marguerite Sheehan said. She said physical activity is a priority for her three children, including 4-year-old Miles.\n\n\n\n\"You want to strengthen muscles early on. Because you want the kids to start being able to be independent. Activity is a big part of that,\" Sheehan said.\n\nAdm. Brett Giroir helped craft the guidelines for the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\"We know that what happens early in childhood really charts a course that can last for decades,\" Giroir said.\n\n\"How is the future different for kids who start by being physically active?\" Narula asked.\n\n\"Children who have unhealthy body weights even at 3, 4 ,5 year olds are much more likely to become obese later in life,\" Giroir said. \"These children should have three hours a day of activity and that could be light exercise, moderate exercise.\"\n\n\n\nThe guidelines tell parents and caregivers to encourage active play and to be models of movement.\n\n\"We go to the playground unless it's really raining bad or cold and even inside we do different activities,\" said Ben Augustine, father of 3-year-old Lina. He found one strategy to overcome the pull of screen time.\n\n\"In addition to reading a book, trying to get them to play and it seems like having a friend to do it with is the best way,\" Augustine said.\n\n\n\nExercise is important for everyone.

Democrats also broke up several Republican strongholds, forcing GOP lawmakers who have been cutting taxes and curbing union powers to deal with a new reality of a Democratic governor.\n\nAll told, Democrats gained seats in 62 of the 99 state legislative chambers, according to data provided by the National Conference of State Legislatures (Nebraska is the lone state with a single legislature). Democrats also added seven new governorships.\n\nIn New York, where a new Democratic-run Senate will provide the missing link in liberals' political power, the expansive agenda could go beyond guns, pot and health care to also include more protections for abortion rights and higher taxes on millionaires.\n\n\"We will finally give New Yorkers the progressive leadership they have been demanding,\" said Sen. Andrea Stewart-Cousins, who stands to lead the Senate when the new session begins in January.\n\nThe U.S. is a deeply divided nation politically, a fact reflected in a midterm vote that gave Democrats the U.S. House while adding to the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate. But within states, the overall outcome of the 2018 elections was a continued trend of one-party control \u2014 Democrats in some places, Republicans in others.\n\nFor the first time since 1914, there will be only one state \u2014 Minnesota \u2014 with its two legislative chambers led by different parties.\n\nIf Republican gubernatorial candidates maintain their slim leads in Florida and Georgia, Republicans will hold full control over the governor's office and legislative chambers in 22 states compared with 14 for Democrats. Just 13 states will have a split partisan control between the governor's office and legislature, nearly matching the 60-year low point set in 2012.\n\nThere also has been a decrease in ticket-splitting between governors and state attorneys general, with the number of such divisions expected to decline from 12 to 10 as a result of Tuesday's elections.\n\n\"This is the most hyper-polarized, hyper-partisan time we've see in generations, and nobody can deny that,\" said Illinois state Sen. Toi Hutchinson, a Democrat who is president of the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nIllinois is one of a half-dozen states where Tuesday's election put Democrats in control of the governor's office and legislature.\n\nDemocrat J.B. Pritzker, who ousted Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, wants to legalize and tax recreational marijuana. He also has promised to push for a constitutional amendment to replace Illinois' flat income tax system with a progressive one that requires the wealthy to pay a greater share.\n\nDemocrats also are planning aggressive agendas in other states where they expanded their political power:\n\n\u2014 Nevada is expected to pass a ban on bump stocks on guns as the state Legislature meets for the first time since the October 2017 mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip. Democrats also will be pushing to spend more on education, expand Medicaid coverage, raise the minimum wage and require employers to provide paid sick leave.\n\n\u2014 In New Mexico, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth said minimum wage and teacher pay increases will be at the top of the agenda. Democrats also could overhaul the state's approach to climate change, gun control and marijuana.\n\n\u2014 In Colorado, Democrats are planning a renewed push to expand health coverage, adopt gun controls, boost public education funding and enhance environmental protections.\n\n\u2014 In Maine, new Democratic Gov.-elect and Attorney General Janet Mills has vowed to finally expand Medicaid. Voters demanded that in a 2017 referendum, but the effort has been slowed by departing Republican Gov. Paul LePage.\n\nThe states shifting to Democratic dominance can look to New Jersey, which held its governor's election in 2017 and replaced a Republican with a Democrat. With the Legislature already controlled by Democrats, the state promptly tightened gun regulations, passed a paid sick-leave requirement and restored funding to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBut it hasn't been like Christmas every day for liberals. It took a last-day deal before the budget expired over the summer to avoid a state government shutdown as Democrats disagreed over which taxes to raise. Lawmakers have missed their own deadlines on legalizing marijuana for adults, and some advocates are upset the state has not moved faster to boost the minimum wage.\n\nNew Jersey state Sen. Loretta Weinberg, a Democrat who's been in the legislature since 1992, said there's a big difference in legislative debates when there's one-party control.\n\n\"It is more about details than the broader principles,\" she said.\n\nSome states that became accustomed to Republican control over the past decade also will be making adjustments.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers have been privately discussing ways they could limit the rule-making powers of Democratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers, who narrowly defeated Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said they are looking at reconstituting boards to make sure they have equal representation.\n\nNorth Carolina's Republican-led Legislature did something similar after Democrat Roy Cooper won the governor's race in 2016. But Cooper successfully sued over a law weakening his influence over the state elections board.\n\nIn Kansas, Democrat Laura Kelly's election as governor immediately recasts the debate over several big fiscal issues.\n\nShe supports expanding the state's Medicaid health coverage as encouraged by the Affordable Care Act. While bipartisan backing for that has grown, supporters had not achieved the legislative supermajorities that would have been needed to overcome the opposition of Republican Govs. Sam Brownback and Jeff Colyer.\n\nKelly also is pledging to reinstate an executive order barring anti-LGBT bias in state hiring and employment decisions, something Brownback rescinded in 2015.\n\nIn Michigan, Democratic Gov.-elect Gretchen Whitmer broke a Republican trifecta while campaigning to \"fix the damn roads\" and replace aging water pipes with a multibillion-dollar infrastructure plan. But tax increases or increased borrowing could be a tough sell in the Legislature, which remains under Republican control.\n\nThe next Senate majority leader, Republican Sen. Mike Shirkey, signaled that he would oppose raising Michigan's corporate income tax and said he would fight any attempt to repeal Michigan's right-to-work laws \"with every ounce of my body.\"\n\nRepublicans who control the Minnesota state Senate said they will fight Democratic Gov.-elect Tim Walz if he follows through with a proposal to raise the gas tax to pay for infrastructure improvements. A number of states have taken that step in recent years to fund road repairs. That includes states where Republicans control the legislature and governor's office, including Indiana, Oklahoma and Tennessee.\n\nSplit power at the Minnesota Legislature also could lead to gridlock on the top issue from the election \u2014 health care. Walz campaigned on expanding one of the state's low-income health care programs to offer a public option, but Senate Republicans have shot that down as an unworkable government takeover of health care.", "", "", "PARIS -- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday became the first Western leader to acknowledge his country had received the recordings of the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\"Canada has been fully briefed up on what Turkey had to share,\" Trudeau said from the Canadian Embassy in Paris, where he was attending the Peace Forum following the WWI Armistice centenary.\n\nOn Saturday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he had given recordings \"to Saudi Arabia, to America, to the Germans, the French, to the British, to all of them.\"\n\nThe Canadian leader is the first since that announcement to officially confirm that his country's intelligence had listened to the audio.\n\nTrudeau said that he himself had not heard them, and he wouldn't give any details on the contents of the tapes.\n\nTrudeau said he thanked Erdogan for \"his strength in responding to the Khashoggi situation\" at the sidelines of the Paris ceremonies this weekend.\n\nFrance's account of Erdogan's claim to have shared the tapes differs somewhat.\n\nWhen questioned on France 2 television Monday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said that Turkey has \"not to my knowledge\" given the French government any such recordings, and suggesting the Turks were playing games.\n\n\"If the Turkish president has information to give to us, he must give it to us,\" Le Drian said.\n\n\"That means he has a political game in this situation,\" Le Drian added, referring to Erdogan.\n\nCIA Director Gina Haspel, who visited Turkey last month for information on the investigation, is reported to have heard the audio recordings of the killing.

In an interview with The Associated Press, she said Long was a \"ticking time bomb\" who constantly lost his temper, threw tantrums and would scream at coaches when he didn't like their decisions. She said she once witnessed him assault a fellow coach.\n\nThat coach, Dominique Colell, said Long grabbed her rear and midsection after she refused to return a cellphone. Another time, he used his hand to mimic shooting her, Colell said, adding that she feared for herself whenever she was around him.\n\nCluke said she also witnessed Long pretending to shoot Colell.\n\n\"When Dominique turned around and saw that, she turned pale as a ghost and it was very, very scary.\" Cluke said. \"Just sadistic. ... He was out of control. He would scream and cuss and his face would turn bright red and people would actually back away from him.\"\n\nLong, a 28-year-old former Marine machine-gunner who served in Afghanistan, opened fire during college night at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks on Wednesday night. He killed 11 people and a police officer who responded, and then fatally shot himself, police said.\n\nAuthorities haven't determined a motive.\n\nColell kicked Long off the track team immediately after he assaulted her, but she and Cluke said the boy's track coach urged her to reconsider because that could compromise Long's goal of joining the Marines.

Attempts to get comment by phone and in person from officials at the school and its district were unsuccessful Friday, when both were closed because of a massive and deadly wildfire in the area.\n\nCluke recalled a time when she and her father sat down with Long for a talk and asked him why he wanted to join the military. His answer, she said, \"is burned in my soul.\"\n\n\"He said he wanted to be in the Marines because he wanted to go fight in the war for our country and he wanted to kill for our country,\" she said. \"When you hear somebody say they want to be in the military because they want to kill people in the name of our country, that's chilling. It chilled me right down to my bones.\"\n\nShe said it's time for school administrators across the country to take behavioral problems seriously.\n\n\"It's not the military or video games or music that causes this,\" she said. \"It's the inaction of people in authority.\"\n\nShe said that if other coaches and school administrators had acted following complaints about Long, \"he could've gotten help and 12 innocent people wouldn't be dead now.\"\n\n\"The warning signs were there,\" she said.\n\nTodd Stratton was at the bar the night of the shooting.

Instead there are more than a dozen fires burning across California currently \u2014 a few of which are historically destructive like the Camp Fire and Woolsey Fire.\n\nBut why are such volatile wildfires persisting past typical fire season, into mid-November? There are many answers, involving both current weather and longer term climate shifts.\n\nRight now a combination of dry ground, low relatively humidity and gusty winds from the mountains are making conditions ripe for fires to spread out of control. Gusts on Sunday morning were clocked over 50 mph in parts of north Central California.\n\nSome strong wind gusts being recorded this morning as northerly winds increase. Gusts of 40 to 50+ mph are being measured in the mountains, locally up to 37 mph in the Valley. #cawx pic.twitter.com/eHg457kOxS \u2014 NWS Sacramento (@NWSSacramento) November 11, 2018\n\nBut there is good news for the northern half of the state. Winds are forecast to slow down making the fires easier to fight.\n\nThe opposite is true, however, for Southern California, where a high wind warning is in effect for parts of the area near the \"Woolsey Fire.\" Winds will easily gust over 50 mph, with some isolated gusts near hurricane force. This makes fighting fires nearly impossible and makes the likelihood of fires spreading out of control even greater. These strong wind gusts will remain an issue at least through Tuesday, with some indication the winds will start to cooperate more by midweek.\n\nRecently, it's been very dry in the Golden State. Over the past 30 days, most of California has seen little if any rain.\n\nIf Northern California had received anywhere near the typical amount of autumn precipitation this year (around 4-5 in. of rain near #CampFire point of origin), explosive fire behavior & stunning tragedy in #Paradise would almost certainly not have occurred. (1/n) #CAfire #CAwx pic.twitter.com/2LBKjSVBMF \u2014 Daniel Swain (@Weather_West) November 10, 2018\n\nWhile normal values of rain are only a couple of inches the first half of autumn, any lack of rain at the very end of fire season, even an inch or two, exacerbates an already grave fire threat. The ground is parched and the brush is like a tinder box.\n\nIn the longer term, a more elaborate story emerges: One of population increases and climate changes.\n\nCalifornia's population has nearly doubled since the 1970s, from around 20 million to nearly 40 million today. As a result, people are encroaching on once sparsely populated areas more vulnerable to fires. Across the country the number of homes on the wildland-urban interface has increased dramatically. A recent study in the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences illustrates the encroachment issue: \"Within the perimeter of recent wildfires (1990-2015), there were 286,000 houses in 2010, compared with 177,000 in 1990.\" High populations mean a higher propensity for fires to be started in those forested areas. This is the direct human element.\n\nBut there is another human element which appears more subtle, yet has substantial real world consequences: That is a changing climate. Since the 1970s, fire season has increased by three to four months. Some have said that California does not have a fire season anymore. It's all year round. Probably the most astonishing fact is that large fires have tripled since the 1970s.\n\nSince the 1970s the number of large fires has Tripled! The reasons are numerous including both climate change & human encroachment on vulnerable land. The climate has warmed, leading to less snow pack, more evaporation, more prevalent droughts and drier ground! @_ClimateMatters pic.twitter.com/J3Et4gdg60 \u2014 Jeff Berardelli (@WeatherProf) November 11, 2018\n\nOver the past few decades temperatures have warmed in the American West. That increases evaporation from plants, trees and soil. At the same time snow pack has decreased and rain is less reliable. Combine all those changing climate factors and you end up with long periods of very dry vegetation. The end result are fires that burn faster, longer and larger.\n\nThe proof of that can be found in just the last several years. Looking at records back to 1930, four out of five of California's largest wildfires have burned in just the past six years.\n\nSo is there any relief in sight? The answer is: Not in the immediate future. Over the next 10 days little, if any, significant rain will fall in the West.\n\nFor the upcoming winter, there is a weak to moderate El Ni\u00f1o forecast. This may be good news for Southern California. But the emphasis is on the word \"may.\" As is typical of El Ni\u00f1o winters, NOAA is predicting slightly above normal rain, but only in the very southern tip of the state. However, the news on temperatures is not as favorable. NOAA forecasts a greater likelihood of above normal temperatures for all of the western U.S.\n\nLooking decades ahead into the more distant future, climate change is forecast to make conditions even more challenging in California. Our best science tells us that the climate will continue to get warmer and drier in most of the state.\n\nAll the evidence points to dangerous wildfires, like the ones currently burning in California, being a new reality of life in the western U.S. Smart land use, planning and development will be necessary to minimize the damage. In the long run, a global effort to fight global warming would also help to stem the destruction. But even if we start now, greenhouse gases lingering in our atmosphere mean trends like warming and drying are now baked in for decades to come.", "", "Fans picked the winners at the 44th annual People's Choice Awards, now called the E!

To get to the bottom of the Moab Khotsong mine, the scientists pile on to an elevator called the cage, jammed in along with the gold miners heading to work. The cage drops slowly at first, then faster and faster, descending 450 stories underground. For comparison, the world's tallest building, Dubai's Burj Khalifa, has only 163 floors.\n\nGuided only by the light of their helmet lamps, the scientists walk miles through a vast maze of tunnels, before taking a chairlift even deeper into the Earth. Here, almost two miles underground, they find rock that was formed three billion years ago. Borgonie and his team collect samples of water trapped in the ancient rocks, untouched by humans.\n\nIn 2011, they made a break-through discovery: Never-before-seen worms were found living in a pocket of water 5,000 years old. The worms were living without sunlight in unbearable heat. Until that point, no one thought animals could exist that deep in the planet's crust.\n\nIt wasn't just worms. Four years later, Borgonie and his colleagues found more animal life in other South African gold mines: an arthropod, a flatworm, and a tiny crustacean, only about one sixty-fourth of an inch. These are among the deepest living creatures ever discovered.\n\nThe discoveries have important implications for where else extreme life might exist \u2014 not just the deep subsurface of Earth, but elsewhere in the solar system. That includes Mars, a planet that has harsh conditions similar to the bottom of the gold mines.\n\n\"Because it means if they can do it here, why would they not be able to do it there?\" Borgonie told 60 Minutes correspondent Bill Whitaker in the video above.\n\nBorgonie said Mars likely doesn't have multicellular organisms, but rather, simple life forms, like bacteria. He also thinks the organisms are most likely to live deep underground. Because the atmosphere on Mars has been blown away by solar wind, there is no longer any water above ground. Without an ozone layer, the sun's rays would destroy anything organic. But there is still water underground on Mars, much like the water trapped deep in the rocks at the Moab Khotsong mine.\n\nBorgonie thinks the chance of finding these simple life forms is much higher than many scientists admit \u2014 and NASA has been following their work closely.\n\n\"Life always finds a way,\" Borgonie said. \"Make no mistake.\"\n\nTo watch Bill Whitaker's 60 Minutes report on the South African gold mine, click here.\n\nThe video above was edited by Will Croxton.", "Eight-year-olds can say a lot of things they don't mean.

When Alfonsi asked how Shaquem learned to catch a ball with only one hand, Terry explained that, getting hit in the face enough times motivated his son to figure it out.\n\nTerry and Tangie's lessons in love also included assuring their sons' focus was on each other. When Shaquem considered quitting football in college, Tangie told him he couldn't.\n\n\"I said, 'Your brother sacrificed a lot,'\" she told Alfonsi. \"'He's playing. He's turned down a lot of schools for you. Now, you're going to have to continue to sacrifice\u2026You're going to stay there, and you're going to support him.'\"\n\nThat sacrifice and dedication to each other is what makes Shaquem's remarkable story also one about Shaquill, Campanile said.\n\n\"This story's about family,\" he said. \"It's about brotherly love, about this commitment that two little boys made in their bedroom in St. Petersburg, Florida: 'We're going to stick together, come hell or high water.'\"\n\nTo watch Sharyn Alfonsi's 60 Minutes report on Shaquem and Shaquill Griffin, click here.\n\nThe video above was produced by Ann Silvio and Lisa Orlando.

Some, like del Toro and Caitlyn Jenner, did not know the fate of their homes, but the wind-driven wildfire has destroyed the home of \"Dr. Strange\" director Scott Derrickson.\n\nThe blaze started Thursday night. By Friday, it had pushed toward Malibu and the Pacific Ocean, prompting evacuations in Malibu, Calabasas, Agoura Hills and other nearby areas.\n\nGerard Butler\n\n\n\nGerard Butler said his home is \"half-gone\" after it was torched by the wildfire. \"Returned to my house in Malibu after evacuating. Heartbreaking time across California. Inspired as ever by the courage, spirit and sacrifice of firefighters,\" the actor wrote on Instagram.\n\nButler shared an image of himself standing outside a burned-out section of the house.\n\n\"Westworld\" set at Paramount Western Town ranch\n\nThe Woolsey Fire reached the ranch that has been the set of numerous movies over the years. The 2,700-acre ranch located between Malibu and the Conejo Valley was purchased by Paramount Sudios in 1927.\n\nWestern Town specifically was built for TV productions in the 1950s and was used for TV series including \"The Cisco Kid\" and \"Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre.\" Filming continued for decades even as the ranch changed hands. It was acquired by the National Park Service in 1980 but has continued to function as a filming location, serving as a location for the first two seasons of the sci-fi series \"Westworld.\"\n\nHBO expressed concern for \"all those affected by these horrible fires.\"\n\nSad for fans of @WestworldHBO and shows like Dr Quinn Medicine Woman, the Paramount Ranch western town movie set has burned to the ground in the Woolsey Fire @CBSLA #westworld #Woolseyfire pic.twitter.com/DhZWaGbr6g \u2014 John Schreiber (@johnschreiber) November 9, 2018\n\nWhen not in use for filming, visitors could stroll through Western Town while hiking, or ride through on horseback.\n\nThe Bachelor Mansion\n\nThe Woolsey Fire reached the Bachelor mansion, according to reports, after Mike Fleiss, head of reality programming for ABC and the creator of The Bachelor, tweeted Friday that the mansion was \"in grave danger.\"\n\nEntertainment Tonight reported Friday afternoon the Villa De La Vina, as it's called, was partially destroyed by the fire. The latest season started filming at the mansion in September, but has since moved to other locations.\n\nThe location is home to three structures. The lower house was destroyed, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nAlyssa Milano on her Malibu home evacuation\n\nAlyssa Milano said Friday her home was \"in jeopardy\" and tweeted, \"If anyone can get 5 horses out the fire please help me.\"\n\nThe actress ultimately got the help she needed and tweeted later in the day that her \"Horses are finally safe. My children are safe. My home is in jeopardy but... everything with a heartbeat is safe. Thank you all for your concern.\"\n\nShe is now helping to raise money for the California Fire Foundation and local animal shelters, tweeting and retweeting resources and ways her followers can help.\n\nHelp me support the firefighters who are risking their lives on the front lines of 3 horrific wildfires: #CampFire #HillFire and #WoolseyFire Donate today to @CAFireFound at https://t.co/cOY5itBGvz #CaliforniaFires \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) November 10, 2018\n\nActor James Wood is united with Milano in helping save animals. He also tweeted resources for horse owners seeking evacuation and called Milano's report that her family and horses were evacuated \"good news.\"\n\nWoods was not among those displaced, tweeting that he was on the East Coast. He asked his nearly two million Twitter followers to use the hashtag #CampFireJamesWoods to help share the names of those who are missing in a separate wildfire in Northern California.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner\n\nCaitlyn Jenner posted a video to Instagram reassuring followers that she, partner Sofia and the dogs are \"safe and sound.\" The status of Jenner's mansion featured on the TC show \"I Am Cait\" wasn't immediately known. Jenner has lived in the home since 2015.\n\nLady Gaga\n\n\n\nThe Woolsey Fire also forced Lady Gaga and her family to evacuate Friday. The singer and \"A Star is Born\" actress posted pictures and video of her family packing and leaving to her Instagram story. One photo depicted thick clouds of smoke and appeared to have been taken from inside a car. It was captioned \"Sending my prayers to everyone today.\"\n\nLady Gaga/Instagram\n\nKim Kardashian West and family\n\nKardashian West posted video on Instagram showing a portion of the blaze. \"Pray for Calabasas. Just landed back home and had 1 hour to pack up & evacuate our home,\" she wrote. \"Firefighters are arriving. Thank you for all that you do for us!!!\"", "Now that Democrats have captured control of the House for the next two years, the party's most senior members are poised to regain the wide-ranging power of committee chairmanships.\n\nWhile some of the Democrats have gained fame in feuds with President Trump, others are relatively little-known outside of Capitol Hill. But in a matter of weeks, they'll have the authority to issue subpoenas, launch investigations and control hearings schedules, among other things.\n\nHere's look at the Democratic lawmakers expected to wield the gavels and shape the party's top priorities:\n\nNITA LOWEY\n\nAppropriations Committee\n\nLowey, 81, would be the first woman to oversee the committee that determines where the federal government spends its money. The New York Democrat, who represents the lower Hudson Valley, said the committee will seek to increase funding for infrastructure and for safety-net programs such as Head Start and Pell grants. The committee will also work to increase budget caps so lawmakers can avoid steep cuts to defense and non-defense programs.\n\nThe committee can also conduct oversight of any Trump administration action that involves government funding, such as how much Cabinet members are spending on travel or how much it is costing the Pentagon to send troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n___\n\nADAM SCHIFF\n\nIntelligence Committee\n\nSchiff, 58, represents parts of Los Angeles, including Hollywood and Burbank. As the top Democrat on the intelligence panel, he has been one of Trump's favorite foils in Congress. Schiff has repeatedly criticized the House's Russia investigation, which his GOP colleagues conducted, saying it was inadequate.\n\nNow Schiff will get his chance to conduct his own targeted investigation into Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign and its ties to Russia. He has said that he wants to look at whether Russians used laundered money for transactions with the Trump Organization. He also wants more information about communications the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., had with his father and others about a June 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer.\n\n___\n\nELIJAH CUMMINGS\n\nOversight and Government Reform Committee\n\nCummings, 67, will likely head the committee that could make life the toughest for the Trump White House because of its broad investigative powers.\n\nCummings would likely seek Mr. Trump's business tax returns and other company-related financial records. He said he will work to make the president accountable, but will also challenge Republicans to uphold their oversight responsibilities, saying, \"I think we as a body can do better.\"\n\nThe Maryland Democrat, who represents parts of Baltimore city and most of Howard County, has said he would also like the committee to examine prescription drug prices and whether some states have engaged in voter suppression.\n\n\"We cannot have a country where it becomes normal to do everything in Trump's power to stop people from voting,\" Cummings said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nHe would also seek to bring Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross before the committee to testify about the decision to include a citizenship question in the 2020 census.\n\n___\n\nJERROLD NADLER\n\nJudiciary Committee\n\nNadler, 71, has been in Congress since 1992 and has served on the Judiciary Committee for much of that time. He represents a large swath of Mr. Trump's hometown of New York.\n\nHe is expected to make one of his first priorities as chairman protecting special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and requesting that Mueller's materials are preserved in case he is fired. Nadler said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week\" that Matthew Whitaker, whom Trump named acting attorney general last week, \"should recuse himself\" from Mueller probe because he \"expressed total hostilities to the investigation\" and \"if necessary\" the Judiciary Committee will \"subpoena\" him to appear before the committee\n\nThe Judiciary panel would also oversee impeachment proceedings, if Democrats decided to move in that direction. But Nadler has expressed caution about the idea, saying there would have to be \"overwhelming evidence\" from Mueller and some bipartisan support.\n\nThe panel is also expected to look into family separation at the border and the Trump administration's management of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n___\n\nMAXINE WATERS\n\nFinancial Services Committee\n\nWaters, 80, is expected to chair a committee with oversight of banks, insurers and investment firms. She has opposed Republican-led efforts to roll back the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and is promising colleagues that she will prioritize protecting consumers from abusive financial practices. The California lawmaker, whose district centers on south Los Angeles County, can also conduct aggressive oversight of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and steps it has taken to reduce enforcement actions against student lenders, pay-day lenders and others.\n\nThe president railed against Waters on the campaign trail this year, frequently mentioning her during his rallies. Waters accuses Republicans of serving as Mr. Trump's \"accomplices.\"\n\n___\n\nCOLLIN PETERSON\n\nAgriculture Committee\n\nPeterson, 74, is a moderate from a heavily rural congressional district in western Minnesota. He is a strong critic of Trump's trade policies and could use his platform to highlight how farmers have been harmed by retaliatory tariffs from China and other nations. His top priority now is to get a farm bill passed, if not in the current Congress, then in the next one. Peterson will also have the committee take a close look at the reorganization underway at the Agriculture Department, including the push to move its top independent research office out of Washington.\n\n___\n\nJOHN YARMUTH\n\nBudget Committee\n\nYarmuth, 71, is serving his sixth term from Kentucky, where he represents much of the Louisville area. He'll put together a budget blueprint that includes Democratic lawmakers' top priorities. He also has said he will hold hearings on a single-payer health plan modeled on the Democratic push to create \"Medicare-for-All.\"\n\n___\n\nELIOT ENGEL\n\nForeign Affairs Committee\n\nEngel, 71, who represents parts of the Bronx and New York City's northern suburbs, has been a consistent critic of the president's foreign policy. He has told colleagues that one of his top priorities will be to investigate where the Trump administration's foreign-policy actions are intertwined with the president's business interests. Protecting the State Department is also a priority for him, including looking into whether career officials have been \"purged\" because they were deemed insufficiently loyal to the president.\n\n___\n\nRICHARD NEAL\n\nWays and Means Committee\n\nNeal, 69, who represents western and parts of central Massachusetts, is expected to lead the committee that has oversight of tax and trade issues. He is promising hearings on the $1.5 trillion tax cut Republicans pushed through last year and has said he would consider a middle-income tax cut, but only if rates for the top income earners go up to help pay for it.\n\nThe committee has jurisdiction over trade, and Neal said he expects Trump's trade deal with Mexico and Canada to come before his committee soon. The panel is also expected to seek Trump's tax returns from the IRS, likely triggering a court fight.\n\n___\n\nBOBBY SCOTT\n\nEducation and the Workforce Committee\n\nScott, 71, is poised to lead the Democratic oversight of changes that Secretary Betsy DeVos has enacted at the Education Department. The Virginia Democrat, who represents parts of the Tidewater area, has told colleagues that he would continue work to free students from the burden of crippling debt, ensure workers have a safe job environment and conduct rigorous oversight to the administration's \"deregulatory agenda.\"\n\n___\n\nFRANK PALLONE\n\nEnergy and Commerce Committee\n\nPallone, 67, hails from north-central New Jersey and was a key player when a Democratic-led Congress passed President Barack Obama's health care law. Pallone said he'll focus on putting forward legislation to protect that law and on lowering the cost of prescription drugs. He'll likely revisit legislation he has sponsored that would, among other things, restore marketing and outreach efforts to get more people enrolled in health insurance coverage and increase subsidies for poor and middle-income Americans.\n\nPallone said he also wants to boost broadband access, renewable energy and access to clean drinking water.\n\n___\n\nPETER DeFAZIO\n\nTransportation and Infrastructure\n\nDeFazio, 71, has hopes of working with the Trump administration on infrastructure legislation to generate jobs and repair roads, bridges and airports. He said he wants to work fast, before the 2020 presidential election process kicks in and makes it harder for anything substantial to get done. The obvious barrier is finding the money, at a time when the national deficit is already exploding. DeFazio, who represents Oregon's southern coastal counties, has put a tiny uptick in gasoline and diesel taxes on the table, but that's a tough sell with lawmakers.\n\nThe committee also has jurisdiction over the General Services Administration, the agency that manages real estate for the federal government, including the lease for the Trump Hotel in Washington. Democrats have sought information about the hotel's profitability and whether Mr. Trump is using the office of the presidency for private gain.\n\n___\n\nADAM SMITH\n\nArmed Services Committee\n\nSmith, 53, says his top national security priority for the next Congress is oversight of the president, from \"the politicization of the military, to his mismanagement of disaster response, to the lack of a consistent policy concerning civilian casualties, to his policies on Russia, and more.\" He said the panel needs to conduct aggressive oversight of the Pentagon's budget and weapons programs to ensure taxpayers are getting the best value. The Democrat from Washington state, who represents the central Puget Sound area, also said it's also important to safeguard \"an inclusive military\" by eliminating discriminatory barriers.\n\n___\n\nBENNIE THOMPSON\n\nHomeland Security Committee\n\nThompson, 70, of Mississippi, will lead aggressive oversight of actions that the administration has taken on immigration, including its \"zero tolerance\" policy of prosecuting all adults caught crossing the border illegally and putting their children under the care of the Department of Health and Human Services. The committee will also examine the administration's response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico, incidents of domestic terrorism by U.S. citizens and what can be done to ensure election security. He represents the western and central parts of Mississippi.\n\n___\n\nRAUL GRIJALVA\n\nNatural Resources Committee\n\nGrijalva, 70, will likely lead a committee that has oversight over national parks and other public lands. The Arizona Democrat has pushed back against the Trump administration's efforts to expand mining and drilling on federal lands. He'll conduct oversight into the environmental toll of the administration's actions. He'll also emphasize stronger consultation with federal tribes before energy projects are approved. Tribes have complained that the Trump administration moved forward with the Keystone XL pipeline without adequate consultation and analysis of the potential impact on tribal lands. Grijalva's southwest Arizona district includes parts of Tucson.\n\n___\n\nMARK TAKANO\n\nVeterans Affairs\n\nTakano, 57, who represents the Riverside, California, area, is the favorite to serve as chairman of the committee after being endorsed by Rep. Tim Walz, who won election to serve as governor of Minnesota. The committee will have oversight of efforts to expand access to private health care providers. He says he would work to hold for-profit colleges accountable when they mislead student veterans and that he would continue work to advocate for deported veterans to ensure they get their citizenship and can access their benefits.\n\n___\n\nJIM McGOVERN\n\nRules Committee\n\nMcGovern, 58, will likely lead a panel that determines what bills are debated on the floor and what amendments are allowed to be voted on. McGovern has been critical of Republicans for blocking votes on amendments with broad public support, but it's unclear how far Democrats will go in reversing those practices. Pelosi has tasked McGovern, who represents central Massachusetts, with coming up with a package of rules governing the chamber, and it's expected to include a ban on House members sitting on corporate boards.\n\nRep. Julia Brownley of California, 66, is vying to serve as chairwoman. She tells colleagues that she would focus on ensuring the VA has the necessary resources to get veterans care from local health care providers without cannibalizing other VA programs. She would also seek to ensure that the administration takes steps to fill senior leadership vacancies and an estimated 46,000 vacant positions within the VA.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "Days after the deadly shooting that left 12 people dead at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is criticizing Democrats for not supporting his legislation to boost law enforcement efforts to prevent mass shootings.\n\n\"The Democrats filibuster any efforts to target the bad guys because their political agenda is instead to try to restrict the Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens,\" Cruz said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"I have right now school safety legislation that would allow money to be directed to hardening schools putting more armed police officers there, making our kids safer. The Democrats have been blocking that.\"\n\nCruz called the shooting \"horrific\" and said it was \"yet another violent crime [where] one of the first inquiries needs to be, how could this have been preventable?\"\n\n\"It appears this young man had significant issues with mental illness. That needs to be examined,\" Cruz said. \"Many of these mass murderers, as you examine them after the fact, there are obvious red flags and failures in the system.\"\n\nPresident Trump blamed the shooting on mental illness on Friday, calling gunman Ian Long \"a very sick puppy\" who had \"a lot of problems.\"\n\nIn April, police responded to a call at the home Long shared with his mother. A mental health specialist who examined Long worried the 28-year-old Marine veteran might have post-traumatic stress disorder but concluded he couldn't be involuntarily committed for observation.\n\nInvestigators have not said whether mental illness was a factor in the shooting. Officials have said Long used a legally purchased handgun in the shooting. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said it was investigating how and when Long purchased the gun.\n\nOn \"Face the Nation,\" Cruz pointed to the shooting last November in Sutherland Springs, Texas, as an example of the failure of the federal background check system.\n\n\"The shooter [in Texas], it was already illegal for him to buy a gun,\" Cruz said. \"And the reason he was able to buy a gun is because the Air Force under the Obama administration never reported his felony conviction to the background check database system. And so, when he when he ran for a background check it came up clean.\"\n\nAlthough California has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, Long would not have been prevented from legally owning a gun without a dishonorable discharge from the military or mental-health red flag.\n\nCruz also said there are \"common sense steps we can and should take concerning law enforcement\" and to prevent those with \"serious mental illness\" from being able to purchase firearms.\n\nIn 2013, Cruz and Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa introduced legislation that would have provided funding for school safety, mental health and prosecuting gun crimes.\n\nThe bill placed no new restrictions on gun ownership and did not expand the federal background check system. It was defeated in a filibuster led by Democrats who pushed for stricter gun control measures in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre.", "", "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \u2014 Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson called on Republican Gov. Rick Scott to recuse himself from \"any role\" in Florida's recount process as the supervisors of elections across the state began a mandatory machine recount of more than 8.2 million ballots cast in this year's U.S. Senate race.\n\nDuring an emergency hearing Monday, Circuit Chief Judge Jack Tuter said he's seen no evidence of wrongdoing in the vote-counting in Broward County and urged all sides to \"ramp down the rhetoric.\" Tuter said there is a need to reassure citizens that the integrity of the Florida recount is being protected.\n\nBut President Trump again alleged without evidence that the state was dealing with voter fraud, writing in a Tweet Monday morning that \"large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged.\"\n\nThe state's law enforcement arm and elections monitors have found no evidence of wrongdoing, but lawyers for the Republican party and the GOP candidates joined with Mr. Trump in alleging that irregularities, unethical behavior and fraud have taken place since the polls closed last week.\n\nThe developments make this a tumultuous political moment in Florida. This recount process is unprecedented even in a state notorious for settling elections by razor-thin margins. State officials said they weren't aware of any other time a race for governor or U.S. Senate required a recount, let alone both in the same election.\n\nIn a video statement, Nelson said Scott is \"using his power as governor to try to undermine the voting process,\" as he called on him to remove himself from the recount. \"He's worried when all the votes are counted, he'll lose the election,\" he said. The Scott campaign said he will be coming to Washington this week to participate in some orientation activities for new members of Congress, including the photo and voting in leadership elections.\n\nUnofficial results showed Republican former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points in the governor's contest.\n\nIn the Senate race, Scott's lead over Nelson was 0.14 percentage points.\n\nIn Broward County, the recount was delayed for hours Sunday because of a problem with one of the tabulation machines. That prompted the Republican Party to accuse Broward's supervisor of elections, Brenda Snipes, of \"incompetence and gross mismanagement.\"\n\nBroward officials faced further headaches after acknowledging the county mistakenly counted 22 absentee ballots that had been rejected. The problem seemed impossible to fix because dismissed ballots were mixed in with 205 legal ballots and Snipes said it would be unfair to throw out all the votes.\n\nScott filed suit against Snipes. He's seeking a court order for law enforcement agents to impound all voting machines, tallying devices and ballots \"when not in use until such time as any recounts.\" The suit accused Snipes of repeatedly failing to account for the number of ballots left to be counted and failing to report results regularly as required by law.\n\nThe court didn't immediately respond, though the outcry from Democrats was immediate.\n\nJuan Penalosa, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, accused Scott of \"using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our democracy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Palm Beach County, the supervisor of elections said she didn't think her department could meet Thursday's deadline to complete that recount, throwing into question what would happen to votes there.\n\nThe recount in other major population centers, including Miami-Dade and Pinellas and Hillsborough counties in the Tampa Bay area, has been continuing without incident. Smaller counties were expected to begin reviews between Monday and Wednesday.\n\nState law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Once completed, if the differences in any of the races are 0.25 percentage points or below, a hand recount will be ordered.\n\nRepublicans urged their Democratic opponents to give up and let the state to move on.\n\nGillum and Nelson insist that each vote should be counted and the process should take its course.\n\nScott said Sunday that Nelson wants fraudulent ballots and those cast by noncitizens to count, pointing to a Nelson lawyer's objection of Palm Beach County's rejection of one provisional ballot because it was cast by a noncitizen.\n\n\"He is trying to commit fraud to win this election,\" Scott told Fox News. \"Bill Nelson's a sore loser. He's been in politics way too long.\"\n\nNelson's campaign issued a statement later saying their lawyer wasn't authorized to object to the ballot's rejection, as \"Non-citizens cannot vote in US elections.\"\n\nGillum appeared Sunday evening at a predominantly African-American church in Fort Lauderdale, declaring that voter disenfranchisement isn't just about being blocked from the polling booth. He said it also includes absentee ballots not being counted and ballots with mismatched signatures that \"a volunteer may have the option of ... deciding that vote is null and void.\"\n\nBoth the state elections division, which Scott runs, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement have said they have found no evidence of voter fraud.\n\nThat didn't stop protests outside Snipes' office, where a mostly Republican crowd gathered, holding signs, listening to country music and occasionally chanting \"lock her up,\" referring to Snipes. A massive Trump 2020 flag flew over the parking lot and a Bikers For Trump group wore matching shirts. One protester wore a Hillary Clinton mask.\n\nRegistered independent Russell Liddick, a 38-year-old Pompano Beach retail worker, carried a sign reading, \"I'm not here for Trump! I'm here for fair elections! Fire Snipes!\" He said the office's problems \"don't make me feel very much like my vote counted.\"\n\nFlorida also is conducting a recount in a third statewide race. Democrat Nikki Fried had a 0.07 percentage point lead over Republican state Rep. Matt Caldwell for agriculture commissioner, one of Florida's three Cabinet seats.\n\nFor some, the recounts bring back memories of the 2000 presidential recount, when it took more than five weeks for Florida to declare George W. Bush the victor over Vice President Al Gore by 537 votes, thus giving Bush the presidency.\n\nMuch has changed since then.\n\nIn 2000, each county had its own voting system. Many used punch cards \u2014 voters poked out chads, leaving tiny holes in their ballots representing their candidates. Some voters, however, didn't fully punch out the presidential chad or gave it just a little push. Those hanging and dimpled chads had to be examined by the canvassing boards, a lengthy, tiresome and often subjective process that became fodder for late-night comedians.\n\nNow the state requires all Florida counties to use ballots where voters use a pen to mark their candidate's name, much like a student taking a multiple-choice test, and the process for recounts is clearly spelled out.", "", "Read more transcripts from Face the Nation here.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It's Sunday, November 11th. I'm Margaret Brennan and this is FACE THE NATION.\n\nWith a split decision in the midterm election for control of the House and Senate, and after igniting controversy, after controversy after controversy at home, President Trump is honoring the one hundredth anniversary of the end of World War I. But at a somber gathering today in Paris, the chill among his fellow world leaders seem to match the weather with a notable exception. We'll talk to two newsmakers who won on Tuesday, including a familiar rival of the President. With Democrats retaking control of the House, leader Nancy Pelosi hopes to regain her job as speaker.\n\nSENATOR TED CRUZ: God bless Texas.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And Texas Republican Ted Cruz will also join us. What are his thoughts on the President's new immigration orders.\n\nCROWD (in unison): Brenda Snipes has got to go.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And chaos in the Sunshine State. Plus, as momentum grows for new acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller probe, we'll talk with South Carolina's Lindsey Graham.\n\nPlenty of politics and news all ahead on FACE THE NATION.\n\nGood morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. It has been a difficult week in America. Following record voter turnout in the midterm elections, some races are still not decided. And the partisan political divide has ripped even wider. A mass shooting killed twelve in California. The suspect is a veteran who may have been suffering from PTSD. Then wildfires exploded in the state, one in Northern California is already the most destructive in California's history. President Trump sparked outrage with tweets blaming California forest management for the disaster and threatening to cut off funding.\n\nToday the President is in Paris attending a ceremony honoring the one hundredth anniversary of the Armistice ending World War I. We begin there with CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang who filed this report.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nWEIJIA JIANG (CBS News White House Correspondent/@weijia): A solemn Sunday in Paris. As President Trump marked the day World War I ended a century go.\n\nBOY: November 11, 1918.\n\nWEIJIA JIANG: He stood alongside dozens of world leaders at the Arc de Triomphe, where the Tomb of the Unknown soldiers symbolizes the ultimate sacrifice. French President Emmanuel Macron seemed to take a veiled swipe at the President's America First agenda.\n\nEMMANUEL MACRON (through translator): Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism by saying, our interest first, who cares about the others, we erase what a nation holds dearest what gives it life, what makes it great and what is essential--its moral values.\n\nWEIJIA JIANG: Mister Trump did not appear amused. While in France, President Trump also recognized the need to maintain strong alliances but he often receives criticism for warming up to adversaries, including Russian President, Vladimir Putin.\n\n(End VT)\n\nWEIJIA JIANG: The White House says President Trump and President Putin will likely meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina later this month. Today, the President is heading back to Washington. Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Weijia Jiang, thank you.\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham joins us this morning from Clemson. Senator, welcome to FACE THE NATION. I want to get right--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina/@LindseyGrahamSC): Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --to it. The French president seemed to be saying the liberal world order is being undermined by forces, nationalist forces, that seem to be represented to many by President Trump. Do you agree to-- with him?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: No. I think he's got a political problem at home Macron does and probably picking a fight with Trump is good politics. I like the idea of President Trump pushing NATO to pay more. Getting out of the intermediate ballistic missile treaty with Russia made sense to me because Russia's cheating and the treaty doesn't cover China and North Korea. I think the main friction is getting out of the Iran deal which I thought was bad for America and really bad for the world. So Republican presidents always have a hard time in Europe. I'm not really worried about this at all.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, let's move to what's happening here at home. You're seeing some of the worst fires in California history raging there.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Nearly dozen dead, yet, the President is-- is taking an aggressive combative stance here.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Even threatening to cut off funding. What's achieved by doing things like this?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, number one, my heart goes out to the people who lost their homes I think about twenty-five people killed. These are historically large wildfires in California. But we do have a forest management problem all over the country we need to address. But, you know, California will receive the money they need. But going forward, we need to look at some of the underlying causes of these fires and it's just not California we need to look at better forest management in-- in terms of federal lands all over the country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you agree with the sentiment, but, perhaps, not the tone is what I hear you saying there.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. Well, this has been a debate for a while about underbrush clearing--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --in federally owned lands, but now is not time to talk about cutting off money. With all due respect we're going to help our friends in California. They need help.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you since you sit, and are an important voice, on the Judiciary Committee--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --about what's happening now with the search for the new attorney general now that Jeff Sessions has been--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --forced out.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You said you're going to meet with the acting attorney general this week.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to ask him to recuse himself? And is Matthew Whitaker's appointment to this role constitutional?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Good question. I talked with Matt yesterday. I'm going to meet with him next week when we get our schedules aligned here. I think he's-- was appropriately appointed legally. I don't think he has to recuse himself. I am confident the Mueller investigation would be allowed to come to a good solid con-- con-- conclusion that there'll be no political influence put on Mister Mueller by Mister Whitaker to do anything other than Mr. Mueller's job. I am confident that Mister Mueller will be allowed to do his job without interference.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I ask you that question because, as you know, there have been a number of public statements made by Whitaker, including saying there's no criminal obstruction of justice charge to be had against--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Mm-Hm. Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --President Trump--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --that seems prejudice-- prejudicial to many. He's referred to special counsel--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --as the Mueller lynch mob. What about these comments suggest to you that he's going to be impartial?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Mm-Hm. Well, you don't recuse somebody because they have opinions different than the people they are overseeing. Trust me there is politics abounds when it comes to the Mueller investigation that Trump is guilty and no matter what Mueller finds. But the bottom line here is that Mister Mueller will be allowed to do his job without political interference by-- by Mister Whitaker. Mister Whitaker, I think, is legally qualified and otherwise qualified to oversee this investigation until a new attorney general will be appointed. And I think that will happen early next year.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Early next year what's your first question for that nominee?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, depends on what the lay of the land is. If Mueller is still not finished with this investigation, are you going to allow him to do his job? But a lot of questions about-- about how the Department of Justice works.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The President issued an order this week and says he is going to issue another executive order having to do with immigration.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Does he have the authority to bypass Congress in doing these things?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: You know, the Fourteenth Amendment birthright citizenship, that's got to get to the court. Maybe the executive order is the way to start that discussion. But when it comes to changing asylum laws saying that somebody here illegally cannot apply for asylum, I don't know if you can do that by executive order, but I support that policy. Right now people are marching on our border, if they-- they cross illegally then they asked for asylum. Asylum shouldn't be a magnet for illegal immigration. So I support the policy change. I'm not so sure you can do it by executive order but we'll see.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the ACLU suggests that that's actually contravening Congress and established law.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I might want to get another-- I might want to get another opinion than the ACLU. But the point is that I do believe asylum laws are being abused. They've become magnets for illegal immigration. People cross the border illegally, then apply for asylum. That's not the way asylum is set up to work. I support the policy change. Congress probably should do it, but I am open-minded to the executive order. I-- I just don't know the answer really.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You've been speaking a fair amount about what's going on in Florida and the recount there.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Florida Department of-- of-- of Elections has presented no evidence whatsoever of criminal activity there.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The President has been sort of fanning the flames, some would say, of conspiracy here, saying Democrats are trying to steal it. Don't you think in--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I think--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --some ways that this undermines election integrity when you're actually trying to uphold it?\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think what undermines election integrity-- integrity is Broward County can't get their act together over multiple elections. If the Florida law enforcement officials see no fraud, I'll accept that. But they are in violation of the law, Broward County. They're supposed to report results within thirty minutes--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --of the polls closing. They counted almost eighty thousand votes days after the polls closed. So the problem is not with the President Trump's rhetoric. The problem is with the incompetence and the mischief--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --in Broward County.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Graham, thank you very much. Lots to get--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --through today.\n\nOn Friday, we sat down with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi who is working to round up the votes among Democrats to become speaker once again. We began our discussion with the Democrats' call for the new acting attorney general to recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller probe after the President asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to step aside last week.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think under Whitaker that the integrity of this investigation is in peril?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (D-California/@NancyPelosi): Yes, I do. First of all, I think that he should recuse himself for any review of the investigation because of statements he has made already in the public domain about the fact that this investigation should not--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You don't have confidence in him as America's top enforcement officer?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: No, I don't, and don't just take it from me. There's bipartisan editorializing about this that-- that he should never have been appointed and that it-- it does violence to the Constitution and the vision of our founders to appoint such a person in such a manner to be the chief legal officer in our country and that's bipartisan.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There are questions about what will happen when Bob Mueller wraps up his investigation, the report and the conclusions he comes to--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --and whether they will ever see the light of day, because we don't know if they are going to be shared with Congress. In a Democrat-controlled House with subpoena power would you force that?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, we don't know if-- if-- the-- what he will decide and what will be made public. But we do want the truth.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The public has a right to know.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Public has a right to know and no one is above the law in terms of our having access to that information.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you don't think it would require a subpoena to the DOJ to release it?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, let us hope not but the Congress-- the beauty of our constitution is the system of checks and balances and in doing so to have oversight responsibility, to be a check. So, in our oversight responsibilities we would want that information.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What are the bounds of-- of that oversight? Because, you know, one of the concerns you hear is Democrats are just going to issue subpoena after subpoena and make the President's life legally more difficult. Is there a limitation to that that you see?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, we are responsible. We are not scattershot. We are not doing any investigation for a political purpose but to seek the truth. So, I think a word that you could describe about how Democrats will go forward in this regard is we will be very strategic.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: No investigation for political purpose you say.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: That's right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: A number of Republicans would say, come on. There's always a-- a political upside or downside to moving forward with some of these in-- investigations.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, if the Republicans would say that they're just projecting their own attitude toward investigations, which was very political. We are coming to do something that is very important for our country; a more open Congress with accountability to the public, with a seeking bipartisanship where we can find it, stand our ground where we can't.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The President has been saying that there's election fraud in Florida.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think is happening in-- in Broward County? Is this election fraud, and is there a role that Congress needs to play in upgrading election infrastructure?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, yes to the second part, but let's go to the first part first. My experience with the President is that any time he charges somebody with something he's just projecting what he might have done himself. We are not engaged--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Election fraud?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, obstruction-- suppression of the vote. Those-- those kinds of issues I think are wrong and not in honor of our sacred right to vote. So, no, there is no election fraud. What there is is an honest count of the vote.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: On immigration, would you try to block any attempt to fund the border wall?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Let's just enlarge that issue into what we need to do as a country. We certainly have to protect our borders, and Democrats know that, and we have always worked to do that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you'd be open to supporting this.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: No, I'm saying that I would--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: As Speaker, would you ever--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --I support protecting--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --shepherd that legislation?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --protecting our border, and we have done that, and there are many ways to protect the border before tens of billions of dollars building a wall where technology and personnel and the rest could possibly do the job. But whatever it is has to be tied to comprehensive immigration reform. What this administration has done is undermining our values. Taking babies out of the arms of their moms as you, a new mom, you understand that bonding--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --very well, with me-- as my-- mother of five, grandmother of nine, understand that bonding very well. Let's take the baby out of the arms of their moms. Let's separate families. Shameful. And what the President just did in the last day on the executive order flies in the face of even what the evangelicals, who are his big supporters, have said. The evangelicals have said the United States amnesty, excuse me, the United States Refugee Resettlement Program is the crown jewel of America's humanitarianism. And what the President did does not recognize what the law of the land is and-- in terms of refugees.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There is a lot more of our interview with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi ahead, including her plans for fixing the Affordable Care Act and the record number of women in the next Congress. That's coming up in our next half hour.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to another of Tuesday's winners, Texas Republican Ted Cruz, a key member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and he joins us from his home in Houston. Senator, welcome to FACE THE NATION.\n\nSENATOR TED CRUZ (R-Texas/@tedcruz): Thank you, Margaret. Good morning. And-- and-- and welcome back yourself. Congratulations on your new son.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I appreciate that. Thank you very much. A little bit of history here. You were part of President Bush's legal team back in 2000 during the Florida recount. We are looking once again at questions about what is happening and a recount there. What is going on? Is this political conspiracy like the President suggests or is this just incompetence?\n\nSENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, listen, I think there is certainly reason to be concerned. Florida's history on recounts has-- has not been great. You've got each of the counties there that-- that have different-- different commissioners. I spoke yesterday with my colleague Marco Rubio who's-- who's following what's happening there closely and is-- and is deeply concerned that-- that-- that what might be playing out is as an attempt to steal the election. I hope that's not it. I think everyone needs to be vigilant. Every vote needs to be counted. But at the same time we can't allow people to be stealing votes and we-- we need to be on guard against that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: A bit of both, you say-- it could be getting stolen or it could just be incompetence?\n\nSENATOR TED CRUZ: It-- the-- the-- it could almost always be a bit of both of incompetence and-- and the potential for malfeasance. But-- but any time you have a recount, you have an invitation for people to-- to-- to violate the law and try to advance their partisans. In-- in 2000, in Bush versus Gore, on election night, George W. Bush had about-- a three-thousand-vote lead and there ended up being a total of four recounts in Florida over and over and over again, and over the course of those four recounts, Bush's lead dropped from about three thousand votes all the way down to five hundred and thirty-seven votes--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR TED CRUZ: --and-- and-- and the mantra of the Democrats is they wanted to keep counting and counting and counting the same votes over and over again until they managed to drop the votes to the other side. I-- I think that suggests if you're recounting the numbers ought to stay the same or roughly the same and if they're moving consistently in one direction it-- it-- it suggests you may not have a fair and level playing field in terms of those counting.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you since you're on the Judiciary Committee about what happened this week, Jeff Sessions being forced out. Now there's an attack-- an acting attorney general overseeing the Russia probe. Do you believe that the special counsel's investigation is now in peril and needs to be protected?\n\nSENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, I-- I don't think anyone was surprised to see Jeff Sessions move on. Jeff-- Jeff is a good man, an honorable man. He's someone who's been a friend a long time. But it was clear that his relationship and the President's relationship were not working, that there was no longer trust and confidence there and-- and that's not a long-term, sustainable situation to have an attorney general and-- and a President in-- in direct and open conflict the way they were. I think Jeff did a number of very good things at DOJ, including on immigration, including on religious liberty, so I am grateful for those efforts. But I think it will be good to see new leadership come into the Department of Justice. Now, Mister Whitaker, as I understand it, has been appointed just in an acting position and-- and the White House has announced they intend to nominate a new attorney general. I-- I expect that to happen quickly and when it does, the-- the Senate will take up the advise and consent role and-- and I'm on the Senate Judiciary Committee so whoever the nominee is, I-- I look forward to hearing from that individual, their background, their record, their qualifications, and-- and-- and their vision for what the Department of Justice should be doing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Should there be legislation to protect the special counsel?\n\nSENATOR TED CRUZ: No, I don't believe there should. We-- we-- we had a bill come through the Judiciary Committee that tried to make it impossible for a special counsel to be removed. I believe that legislation was unconstitutional, that-- that it was inconsistent with Article II of the Constitution.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You were very critical of the Obama administration for taking action via executive fiat as you said, you called it dangerous.\n\nSENATOR TED CRUZ: Mm-Hm. Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: This week President Trump on immigration has issued orders bypassing Congress to restrict how migrants crossing the border illegally can claim asylum. Are you okay with that now?\n\nSENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, I'm still studying the specific immigration order but-- but I'll tell you, look, here's my view on executive orders--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But bypassing Congress?\n\nSENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, let-- let me explain my view on-- on immigra-- on-- on executive orders whether from Trump or Obama, George W. Bush or anybody else, which is there is a legitimate role for an executive order and that is governing how the executive branch operates. How under Article II of the Constitution the president of the executive branch is charged with-- with taking-- taking due care that the laws are faithfully executed. And an executive order is perfectly appropriate to direct the executive branch, this is the manner in which we shall execute the law. What Obama did repeatedly that was so lawless is his executive orders didn't do that. Instead, they said here is the federal law passed by Congress signed by the President that we will defy, that we will ignore, and-- and that the President can't do. And-- and so that's the question on any executive order is-- is it-- is it directing how the executive will behave or is it flying in defiance to-- to laws passed by Congress. If it's the latter it's unconstitutional.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, I-- I don't hear a clear answer on whether you think this asylum change is okay. Do you think via executive order, it is appropriate for the President to end birthright citizenship, again bypassing Congress?\n\nSENATOR TED CRUZ: Well-- well-- well, Margaret, as-- as I said on-- on the-- on the executive order on immigration I have not studied that order, yet, it just came out this week. You know I have to admit I-- I was kind of busy, we had an election a couple of days ago. And-- and-- and that-- that so, I have not yet reviewed the executive order, and I try on legal decisions. My career has been being a constitutional litigator, so I-- I don't-- I don't reach constitutional opinions lightly. If the order defies the laws of Congress, then, yes, it's unconstitutional. If the order constrains and directs how the executive will implement the law then it's not. Now my understanding is this executive order does things directing resources to the border. Those resources are clearly within the purview of an executive order for the President--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And birthright citizenship executive order that's coming.\n\nSENATOR TED CRUZ: And the President is charged under existing law-- the-- the President is charged under executive un-- under federal law with securing the border, and if the executive order is in furtherance of the statute then it's not only allowable, it-- it-- it's appropriate and good. I mean this so-called migrant caravan of-- of over ten thousand people marching north, declaring their intention to cross the border illegally. I can tell you I told the President just recently when he and I spoke. I said Mister President under no circumstances should we let them cross, we should use whatever tools are available, whether it is border patrol whether it is National Guard whether-- whether--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR TED CRUZ: --it is the military that the President has called up but we shouldn't allow ten thousand people to blatantly and deliberately violate the law. There is a right way to come to this country and-- and that's following the law--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR TED CRUZ: --waiting in line and following the rules.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well, we look forward to hearing your views on birthright citizenship and those asylum decisions. We've got to leave it here, Senator.\n\nWe will be back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Don't go away.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We also talked to Senator Cruz about what could be done about gun violence for people suffering from mental illness following that shooting in California this week. That clip is available on our website at FaceTheNation.com.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION on this Veterans Day. More from Leader Pelosi and our panel. So, stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We want to continue our conversation with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. In the next Congress, there will be at least a hundred women in the House; that's a record. We asked Leader Pelosi about the new freshman class.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (D-California/@NancyPelosi): We got twenty-three women, got us to the majority. And then we have many men, some of people of color among those men. It's to take us to bigger heights. I want to salute them--quality of our candidates who-- who took their message, their why--why they wanted to be in-- in Congress, what they cared about, and what they knew about that, and how they connected in a very personal way with their constituents. They-- we own the ground because people were inspired by them, and the outside groups did so much--door to door, telling stories about health care and why that was important in this election, and so many other personal stories. So, personal stories won the day. Health care was the big issue. I am here to protect that health care. In terms of the diversity, we used to be over fifty percent women, people of color and LGBTQ. Now we're over sixty percent and that's a-- a beautiful thing, that diversity for our country. The additional people who will be-- who will change the face of security in our country and of our-- not only our national security, but our-- our-- our national economy. People say, oh, you're going to have more women so you'll have more emphasis on child care. Well, we already have that, and we'll do more. But the-- the point is is that every issue is a women's issue.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: One of the issues that Democrats campaigned on was protection of the existing health care law.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Republicans and the President have talked about precon-- preexisting conditions and something they want to actually protect. So, what does that actually mean in practical sense? Do you think that there is any room for reform of ACA, of Obamacare?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, you have two different questions. One is the-- the preexisting condition as a-- not being a barrier to getting coverage is part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: The Republicans have tried to disrupt that. They did it in their Trumpcare or I don't care bill that he had, and it was defeated. They now are going-- they didn't succeed in the Congress. So, now they are going to the courts, and a large number of Republican attorneys general throughout the country have brought suit against the preexisting condition benefit. And instead of protecting the law of the land the President has sided with those attorneys general who want to eliminate that benefit. They misrepresented during the campaign where they were on this. They have another chance now, with us in the majority, to join us into removing all doubt that the pre-existing medical condition is the law-- the benefit-- is the law of the land.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Does this change anything for you, in terms of your-- your sense of needing to stay here right now?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: But I-- the-- I-- the more--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Needing to stay as Speaker?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, I-- I'm staying as Speaker to protect the Affordable Care Act. That's my main issue, because I think that's, again, about the health and financial health of the America's families and if Hillary had won, I could go home. Nobody from California ever gets Potomac fever. You may know that. But--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's still your north star right now, though?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: What?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The protection of the Affordable Care Act?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Yes. that-- that-- that--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --as speaker?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --I mean, I-- I hopefully, we will have a-- a-- a woman President very soon, but that's not the-- the-- the fact that we almost had one would have been motivation for me to say, \"There's a woman at the table.\" It's very important. You cannot have the four leaders of Congress, the President of the United States, these five people, and not have the voice of women. Especially, since women were the majority of the-- the voters, the workers in campaigns and now part of this glorious victory. But these women bring each their individual-- individual excellence to the Congress, and we're very proud of it. When I came to Congress, there were twelve Democratic women. I said, \"We have to change this.\" Now we'll have close to ninety. And that's a-- a major accomplishment for-- for the American people, but also for the Congress.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: How do you respond to those who say there still needs to be more diversity in the leadership, either age wise, because you look at-- at the other two leaders alongside you in-- seventy-eight years old at--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Yeah. Well, that's a--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you need to have some of these new progressives who've come in younger--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: We've had them. We have had them--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --in leadership?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --in the leadership along the way, and that more will be in now that we have more positions. When you have-- when you have the majority, you have more positions--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --to put people in leadership. But our leadership doesn't just extend to the caucus chair, vice chair, all that. It's about the leadership of our co-- committees. And in our leadership of our committees, we have beautiful diversity--women, people of color, LGBTQ. It's a-- it's a sight to behold, to see all of that diversity, all of that talent leading the way. And some of the people here like being a chair--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --more than they'd rather be chair of the caucus, they would be the chair of the Armed Services Committee or chair of the Financial Services Committee--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And that's how you would resolve these questions?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, it's-- it-- people have to run. When I first ran, people said, \"Who said she could run?\" Nobody smoothed a path for me. I've tried to smooth the path for others, but you have to run, you have to want to do it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Policy wise, what does that mean?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Policy wise that means that the face of security-- national security in our country will be very different and very diverse. We have many women coming in with experience in national security. We have many men-- women here moving up in the ranks on national security, but I want to make sure that everybody has a security credential--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --whether it's all-- in all of the different committees of jurisdiction in that regard. It also means that women will be taking the lead on our-- our-- our economy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: When you said you're a transitional figure. Is that what you're transitioning towards? Handing off to these women?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, I have always considered myself a transitional figure. I am on a mission and that mission was to honor what we did with the Affordable Care Act. It-- it stands with Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid as pillars of economic, as well as health security for the American people. When we had the opportunity to do it, we fought hard and we won. And now we have to protect it. Not just as a legislative matter, but as what it means in the lives of the American people. And so I-- I think we're on a good path to-- to protect it. It was the central issue in this campaign. And so many of the outside groups told their stories, walked their precincts, won their votes, for us to preserve and protect the Affordable Care Act and improve it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with our panel.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Now for some analysis on a week that defies words here in Washington. We welcome our political panel. Dan Balz is the chief correspondent at The Washington Post, Rachael Bade covers Capitol Hill for Politico and she is also a CNN political analyst, Mark Landler is a White House correspondent for The New York Times, and Ed O'Keefe is a political correspondent here at CBS News. Ed, let's start off with you. We have these midterm races Tuesday.\n\nED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do we have final results from some of these other races that are outstanding?\n\nED O'KEEFE: Well, first of all, welcome back.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks.\n\nED O'KEEFE: We're glad to have you back in the building, in fact.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congrats to you. You're a new dad as well.\n\nED O'KEEFE: That's a-- well, yes. But the answer to your question is, no, there is still several unresolved races. We should start with the big one in Florida, of course, the Senate race where Rick Scott maintains a fifty percent to 49.9-percent lead. But you can see there, just about as many people that show up in a traffic jam in Miami separate these two from, you know, first and second place. Florida governor's race, obviously, is still very tight. The Arizona Senate race: what was notable there, of course, since the Democrat Kyrsten Sinema has pulled into the lead. You talked to Republicans in Arizona, they quietly concede Sinema will probably hold on and win. And the Georgia governor's race, the goal of Democrat Stacey Abrams is to see if Brian Kemp gets below fifty percent. But in the ongoing recounts, he hasn't done that. So he may ultimately hold on there. Handful of House races have not, yet, been called. CBS and the other networks do it slightly differently than the Associated Press, so we're a little more cautious in-- in-- when that-- those calls are made. And as the speaker mentioned, speaker-to-be we presume, more than thirty seats will be picked up by Democrats. So she will grow the size of her caucus. And, notably, too, they were going to have more than one hundred women in the House which I think really transforms the governing dynamic up on Capitol Hill and will make for really interesting few years.\n\nRACHAEL BADE (Politico/@rachaelmbade): Hmm. That's true.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So that's where we are in terms of the numbers. But in terms of the opinions, some have very different views on where these races are, Dan. I mean, the President has weighed in and you heard Senator Lindsey Graham also cast some doubt on what's happening in Florida and the-- the integrity of that election there.\n\nDAN BALZ (The Washington Post/@danbalz): Yeah. The President weighed in and-- and, basically, accused Democrats of trying to steal both the-- the elections in Florida and in Arizona without any evidence of theft or fraud. There are problems in some of the counties in Florida, which is, unfortunately, not a new situation in Florida and-- and those of us who, you know, covered the two thousand recount--remember all of the problems down there--and some of those have not been solved. But there is a-- you know, the counting often goes slowly and it takes sometimes days and weeks in some states to actually get a final vote on these elections. And there's a process underway. It will be closely watched, at this point. The opportunity for fraud will probably be quite minimal, at this point, given all the attention that's going on. But the President by doing that undermines faith in the basic process of our democracy. And it would be better, obviously, if-- if people in positions of power let the process play out, there are a lot of people who think that the Republicans likely will hold on to both of those tight races in Florida. They are ahead narrowly, but they may have enough votes to be able to hold on. People should simply wait.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Rachael, biggest Democrat gain in the House since 1974 and more women than we have ever seen winning elected office for this new Congress.\n\nRACHAEL BADE: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Given this environment, does that change much?\n\nRACHAEL BADE: You know we'll have to see. I mean I think that Republicans know that they have bled in the suburbs. Republican leadership, they were encouraging the President before the election to sort of tone down a lot of this heated rhetoric. He did not, and they paid a price for it. The question here is, do Republicans learn from it going forward? And the President in terms of looking at 2020, I think, he thinks his own reelection is better. If he continues that rhetoric, which is a different, sort of, election than House Republicans would need to retake the House. In terms of Republican or-- in terms of women coming to Washington, I can tell you that you on Capitol Hill there is already discussions about changing the campus to make sure they can accommodate all these women. And make sure that it's a friendly work environment for mothers. There's new baby changing tables in bathrooms for lawmakers and there's talk about nursing stations around the Capitol. But, again, policy changes, you saw Pelosi talk about health care making that a key issue next year. And I think that would be smart for them, especially, because Republicans sort of tried to deflect a lot of attacks on health care by saying, \"We do care about preexisting conditions when, in fact, they tried to repeal Obamacare.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Sliding in the suburbs, I think, is how Leader McConnell put it--\n\nRACHAEL BADE: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --in terms of a-- a problem for the GOP. But, Mark, for the President--as Rachael just said--does this necessarily cause a change in tone, a change in behavior for him because certainly after Tuesday he seemed as combative as ever?\n\nMARK LANDLER (The New York Times/@MarkLandler): If anything more combative. I mean, he came out and-- and made this rather hapless effort to claim victory. And then when it became clear over the ensuing days that, really, he had taken a stinging setback in the House. You saw his mood, sort of, deteriorate through the week. And, as Rachel said and Dan, he-- he went after the electoral process in Florida, he went after the press, he went after the rule of law in a sense in putting Matt Whitaker into a job in the-- in the Justice Department on an acting basis that many people have profound problems with. So you really saw him shift to an aggressive stance on almost across the board. There are issues where the President has said he could work with the Democratic House--infrastructure being one; potentially, immigration. But the big question that-- that I would have is, is the President going to be capable of compartmentalizing potentially productive work on the legislative side with an unrelenting round of investigations that he now faces in a Democrat-controlled House. I think that's emotionally going to be very difficult for him and he already made clear in the past week that if the Democrats really investigate him aggressively, he will respond in a war-like way. He will try to investigate them. So it's sort of difficult from where we sit based on watching his demeanor over the past three days to see how he shifts to a more cooperative, collaborative stance. It feels like we're in for more and more partisan combat.\n\nRACHAEL BADE: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And what should we expect in terms of cabinet member departures, Jeff Sessions that was telegraphed for months.\n\nMARK LANDLER: I think the big one-- I think the big one to watch out for is Jim Mattis, the defense secretary. You-- you may recall the interview where the President said, well, Jim Mattis is--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nMARK LANDLER: --basically a Democrat. So-- so the-- the question is, does Jim Mattis really take this as a cue to either leave on his own steam or will the President now put pressure on him. John Kelly, the chief of staff, is another person to watch. The President-- John Kelly, rather, has said that he's been asked to stay through 2020. We'll see whether that really happens. There's evidence his wings have already been clipped within the White House. But I think the really consequential one is-- is Mattis. And that's one that would have really a profound affect in foreign perceptions of the United States and in the foreign policy and the national security of this administration for its last two years of the first term.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Ed, how does that environment that we just heard describes shape up for the President? I mean you've had already a number of the Democrats who expect to be in leadership positions in the new Congress say they're readying subpoenas.\n\nED O'KEEFE: Right. And-- and I think actually while we watch the dynamics among the President and his staff, one of the more interesting subplots in Washington over the next few months at least certainly will be bringing in that new wave of Democrats, many of whom were elected on the idea that they want to come here and serve as a check on the President. A lot of younger people who were inspired to run because of him and their opposition to him and how they run into a leadership class led by or at least for now Nancy Pelosi, and older committee chair-- chairman and chairwoman who will want to do a lot of this work but aren't necessarily going to want to go as far as a lot of base Democratic voters across the country want them to go. Jerry Nadler, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, reiterated again this morning as has speaker-presumed Pelosi that they will only go into impeachment if the evidence is overwhelming and if there is bipartisan support for doing so. That is a high bar--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nED O'KEEFE: --both of those. And I think that could create some early conflict among Democrats. But you'll see them go after things like, what was going on at EPA when Scott Pruitt was there? Why does the Secret Service have to pay money at Trump Tower and Mar-a-Lago and all these other places? And try to go after the President's tax returns. And each one of those has the potential to really upset him.\n\nRACHAEL BADE: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Still Republican-controlled Senate as a backstop for that. But we have more to talk about in a moment with our panel. So stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with our panel of journalists. And we want to discuss some explosive exchanges this week between the President and members of the White House press corps.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's enough.\n\nJIM ACOSTA (CNN): Mister President, if I may ask one other question.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's enough.\n\nJIM ACOSTA: Pardon me, Ma'am.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, that's enough.\n\nI'm not-- I'm not responding. I'm responding to-- excuse me, I'm not responding to you. I'm talking to this gentleman. Will you please sit down?\n\nAPRIL RYAN (American Urban Radio Networks): But you (INDISTINCT).\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. Excuse me. Will you please sit down? Please, go ahead.\n\nYAMICHE ALCINDOR (PBS NewsHour): On the campaign trail, you called yourself a nationalist. Some people saw that as emboldening white nationalists. Now people are also saying that the--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't know why you'd say that. That's such a racist question.\n\nYAMICHE ALCINDOR: There are some people--\n\nABBY PHILLIP (CNN): Do you want him to rein in Robert Mueller?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: What a stupid question that is. What a stupid question. But I watch you a lot. You ask a lot of stupid questions.\n\nMAN: Mister President--\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That was the President there speaking about Abby Phillips (sic) of CNN who is a very smart journalist. You also heard Jim Acosta of CNN; April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks; Yamiche Alcindor of PBS, all getting real fire from the President. Mark, what's happening here? I mean the President always seems to be combative with the press but to many this seems a new level of aggression.\n\nMARK LANDLER: Yeah. I think that-- that the midterm election and the setback he suffered there has maybe changed his psychological frame and not for the better. We were used to this kind of a vexed relationship. We've had it with him from the start. But what you saw this past week was really of a very different order. Stripping the credential of the CNN correspondent Jim Acosta, that's something that-- that no recent President in memory has tried to do. And-- and the attacks, the verbal attacks on April Ryan, Abby Phillipm and Yamiche Alcindor are-- are particularly, I think, problematic because the three of them are African-American women. For him to say to Yamiche, a former colleague of mine, that asking him a very valid question about his inflammatory rhetoric is somehow a racist question I think really is at some level beyond the pale. Likewise with Abby she asked an absolutely valid question about the future of the Mueller investigation under a new leadership at the Department of Justice. And April Ryan who, by the way, wasn't even present for the session where he simply went after her--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARK LANDLER: --presumably, because she had tried to ask him a question at his press conference earlier in the week. These are all professional women doing their jobs the right way and for him to single them out and be so ad hominem I think is a new level for those of us in the press corps that have been used to this I think we're-- we're all a little bit stunned by what we saw this past week.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And, Dan, there is a lot to be said in parsing this, and that the media shouldn't be talking about itself as much as we have been in terms of this aggressive line with the President. But tell us why this matters in the broader political sense? You did have some journalists organizations come out and even criticize the phrasing of questions from fellow journalists. Is there a policing of the Fourth Estate that needs to be done or is this in any way acceptable of this kind of language?\n\nDAN BALZ: Well, there's always self-reflection that needs to be done by those of us in the press. I mean I think we all have to constantly think about how-- what's the best way to do our job, particularly, in a very difficult environment. And I think every news organization and every reporter who covers stories like this does ask those questions. But-- but that begs the issue of what the President has done, not just this week and I agree with Mark, this was-- this was another, you know several levers up in his attacks on the press. But he has done it consistently and it is-- it is strategic on his part because it is designed to undermine the validity of a free press.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nDAN BALZ: And, secondly, we know that it inflames his base supporters. I mean, I think everybody around this table gets e-mails from people who are very loyal to Donald Trump.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nDAN BALZ: Who, in fact, believe that-- that we take it as our job to try to undermine him. That is not the case. We hold people in power accountable whether they're Democrats or Republicans. We can be tough on Presidents, and we often are, and Presidents don't particularly like that. But most Presidents or all previous Presidents have reacted differently than President Trump has. And I think that's the issue. And-- and as Mark said particularly, the attacks on three African-American female correspondents, all of whom are professional in the way they approach their job, is-- is another aspect of this that is even different from simply attacks on the press.\n\nED O'KEEFE: Well, and he's-- and he's taken on two Latino correspondents as well. Cecilia Vega at a previous one, and Jim Acosta. And, you know, for some of us, that isn't coincidence.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nED O'KEEFE: And I think that's part of what is so troubling. But, you know, one thing we need to point out with this President, like him or hate him--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nED O'KEEFE: --the press corps sees him and gets to question him more often--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right, a lot of access.\n\nED O'KEEFE: --than we did George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nDAN BALZ: It's a very good point.\n\nED O'KEEFE: Yeah.\n\nDAN BALZ: Very good point.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Rachael, just button us up here quickly. I mean, for those who say this is-- we're being overly sensitive that there's nothing racist in what the President did. There was a lot of strains these nationalist tones, so to speak, that were rewarded on the campaign trail. Were they not?\n\nRACHAEL BADE: Yeah, absolutely. I think that, you know, race right now is like-- is one of those topics that Republicans-- it's-- it's hurting them right now when they hear and they're following the President, they're trying to distance themselves from the President but, you know, this keeps coming back and hurting them on the campaign trail. I mean, that of Steve King--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nRACHAEL BADE: --and some of the rhetoric that has come out of, you know, his mouth and it sort of divided the Republican leadership about whether or not to back him or just not say anything and we actually saw one Republican leader, the NRCC chairman Steve Stivers come out and say, \"Listen, this kind of rhetoric is not acceptable. We have to stand up against it.\" Notably, no other House Republican leaders did that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: They use resilient.\n\nRACHAEL BADE: Yeah. And-- and he is-- he was re-elected.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But we have so much to digest from this week, I think all of us by the end of it.\n\nWe are going to be right back here on FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. It's great to be back with you.

But out of more than 300 new models, Kelley Blue Book just named the subcompact luxury SUV as the 2019 model year's best offering in that category and the overall \"best new model.\" With a starting retail price of $33,700 Kelley Blue Book called it the top value for 2019.\n\nThe XC40 is among the 14 cars cited in the 2019 Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Awards. It's the fifth annual survey of new or redesigned models by the Irvine, California, automotive research company, which specializes in telling people the value of their cars. Blue Book picks different model categories ranging from compacts to pickup trucks and luxury vehicles, with a nod to minivans, performance cars and electric/hybrids.\n\n\"This is a real-world-based award,\" said Executive Publisher Karl Brauer. \"Most automotive journalists focus on speed and handling. We use that, but also bring in the costs of maintenance, fuel, dependability of the vehicle, safety and depreciation.\"\n\nKelley Blue Book\n\nKelley Blue Book began publishing in 1926 and focuses on resale value and five-year cost to own, for which it maintains a huge database. But while it has been offering awards since 2003, it began its best buy list in 2015. Consumer Reports, Edmunds and J.D. Power also compile similar lists.\n\nForeign cars dominate the list\n\n\n\nThe Kelley Blue Book 2019 best buys are heavily weighted toward foreign cars, with Honda's Civic compact, midsize Accord and Odyssey minivan taking top honors in their respective categories, as did Honda's compact SUV, midsize SUV and plug-in hybrid. New models from Audi and Hyundai each grabbed two categories. The only U.S. models on the list were two Fords: the venerable, but redesigned, F-150 pickup and the full-size SUV Expedition.\n\nGuy Spangenberg\n\nBrauer said the deciding factor was how people viewed older vehicles. Most cars are on the road for 10 to 11 years, with the original owner keeping it for six. \"Statistically in resale, foreign cars have the advantage,\" he said. \"They depreciate less. The Honda Odyssey and the Chrysler Pacifica are both fantastic values, but the Honda wins in resale.\"\n\nWhile Americans may be prejudiced toward foreign cars, their love affair with autos -- particularly big vehicles -- continues, even though prices have gone up as incentives go down. Once-massive dealer inventories have also been kept in check. This means those TV ads claiming \"we are overstocked\" are probably more of a come-on than a reality.\n\nKelley Blue Book\n\nThe industry remains on track to crack 17 million units in sales for the fourth year in a row, which Blue Book calls unprecedented. \"There may still be some slowing yet, but it's hardly a buyer's market,\" it said.\n\nIts latest list covered all the ground between small cars and large trucks, crossovers and SUVs. But it's clear that SUVs are taking more than two-thirds of the market, while traditional car sales dropped to less than a third.\n\nWhy bigger instead of smaller? The industry has been able to build smoother-riding, more luxurious and more fuel-efficient SUVs and trucks, Brauer said. But perhaps the real reason is psychological. \"Sitting up higher gives you a lot more confidence,\" he added.\n\nComplete 2019 list of \"Best Buys\"\n\n\n\n(Base price)\n\nCompact car\n\nHonda Civic ($19,450)\n\nMidsize car\n\nHonda Accord ($23,570)\n\nSubcompact SUV\n\nHyundai Kona ($19,990)\n\nCompact SUV\n\nHonda CR-V ($24,250)\n\nMidsize SUV\n\nHonda Pilot ($31,450)\n\nFull-Size SUV\n\nFord Expedition ($52,130)\n\n\n\nMinivan\n\nHonda Odyssey $30,090)\n\nSubcompact Luxury SUV\n\nVolvo XC40 ($33,700)\n\nCompact Luxury SUV\n\nAudi Q5 ($42,950)\n\nMidsize Luxury SUV\n\nAudi Q7 ($53,550)\n\nPickup Truck\n\nFord F-150 ($28,115)\n\nPerformance Car\n\nHyundai Veloster N ($30,000 estimated)\n\nElectric/Hybrid Car\n\nHonda Clarity Plug-In Hybrid ($34,290)\n\nLuxury Car\n\nLexus ES ($39,600)\n\nBest New Model\n\nVolvo XC40 ($33,700)", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Two people were killed and four others were wounded Saturday in a shooting in Tennessee, authorities said.

Whitaker's skepticism of the scope and authority of Mueller's role has prompted some Democrats call for him to either recuse or step aside.\n\nGraham told \"Face the Nation\" host Margaret Brennan on Sunday he believes the acting attorney general was \"appointed appropriately\" and \"legally,\" and he's \"confident\" Whitaker won't interfere in Mueller's ongoing investigation.\n\n\"I talked with Matt yesterday,\" Graham said. \"I'm going to meet with him next week when we get our schedules aligned here.

I'm confident that Mr. Mueller will be allowed to do his job without interference.\"\n\nWhitaker took on oversight of Mueller's investigation after President Trump announced Whitaker would replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Twitter Wednesday. Mr. Trump's Twitter announcement, hours after Tuesday's midterm elections, launched Whitaker into the spotlight.\n\nFormerly Sessions' chief of staff, Whitaker had questioned the scope of Mueller's investigation and made some comments interpreted as critical of Mueller's appointment itself. Sessions had recused himself in the Russia probe, citing his involvement in the Trump campaign, an action the president never seemed to forgive.\n\nMr. Trump grew testy with CNN's Abby Phillips earlier this week when she asked him he if will ask Whitaker to rein in the Mueller probe.\n\n\"What a stupid question,\" the president said, adding that Phillips \"asks a lot of stupid questions.\"\n\nOn another topic, Graham didn't express particular concern over the president's treatment of allies during his trip to Paris. French President Emmanuel Macron said in a speech celebrating Armistice Day in Paris Sunday that the liberal world order is being undermined by nationalist forces.

Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona has introduced legislation along with Democratic Sen.

I believe that legislation was unconstitutional, that it was inconsistent with Article II of the Constitution,\" Cruz added.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has describes Flake's legislation to shield Mueller as unnecessary.\n\nMr. Trump berated a reporter last week on the White House South Lawn for asking whether Mr. Trump will ask Whitaker to rein in the Mueller investigation.\n\n\"What a stupid question,\" the president told CNN's Abby Phillips.\n\nBut Cruz demurred on whether ending birthright citizenship through executive order would be unconstitutional. Mr. Trump has threatened to sign an executive order attempting to do just that. Asked repeatedly by Brennan whether issuing such an order and bypassing Congress would defy the Constitution, Cruz stuck to other points, focusing on the president's decision to send troops to secure the border and proclamation limiting asylum claims signed on Friday.\n\n\"Well, Margaret, as I said on the executive order on immigration I have not studied that or yet, it just came out this week,\" Cruz said. \"You know, I have to admit I was kind of busy we had an election a couple of days ago. And so I have not yet reviewed the executive order, and I try on legal decisions, my career has been being a constitutional litigator, so I don't reach constitutional opinions lightly.\"\n\n\"If the order defies the laws of Congress then, yes it's unconstitutional.

Whoever first coined \"He's a rockstar\" as shorthand for boldfaced success could easily have had Daltrey in mind.\n\nJim Axelrod asked Daltrey how long it took him to get used to grand-scale fame. \"About 50 years!\" he laughed.\n\nNow pushing 75, Daltrey is at the point where he's considering not just his career, but his life \u2013 and for the first time, he's looking back on it, with a memoir called \"Thanks a Lot, Mr. Kibblewhite\" (Henry Holt), a title that nods to the source of his ambition: his school principal who threw him out at the age of 15 for misbehaving.\n\nHenry Holt\n\nDaltrey said, \"There was that moment when he kicked me out of the school. And as I was going through the door with my back to him, he said, 'You'll never make anything of your life, Daltrey.' And that was it. If he hadn't have said that, maybe I wouldn't have made anything of my life.\"\n\nBorn in a working class neighborhood in London, Daltrey met a couple of schoolmates \u2013 Pete Townshend and John Entwhistle \u2013 who shared his love for Elvis, Bo Diddley, and the Everly Brothers.\n\nDaltrey pointed out to Axelrod the house where he'd lived from age 11 until he left home. \"This is the house where I made my first guitar, and that room up there was my mother's bedroom, that's where The Who started. We made hell of a racket! The neighbors never complained; they were so happy I gave up the bugle and started a band!\"\n\nThey would refine that \"racket,\" add drummer Keith Moon, and build a sound around Townshend's hard-driving chords that spoke to teenagers' rage, angst and isolation.\n\nThe Who's music was different from what The Beatles and Rolling Stones were producing. \"Yeah, this was in-your-face stuff,\" Daltrey said. \"And the stuff that came from the inside of youth of the day.\"\n\nWhile the chemistry clicked, they'd go on to sell 100 million records, it was a combustible mix. \"It was a very volatile group of people,\" said Daltrey. \"We were more like a gang, we much more like a gang than a group,\" he laughed.\n\nThe band's success was matched only by its excess \u2013 a threat that constantly shadowed The Who from the beginning.\n\n\"We went on our first European tour and they started taking amphetamines and all kinds of drugs,\" Daltrey recalled. \"And the last show, they were playing things so fast and I couldn't get the lyrics in. I said, 'I'm gonna put a stop to this.' So, went straight into the dressing room after the show, raided Keith Moon's suitcase and flushed it all down the toilets!\"\n\nBut the drugs never really went away. Keith Moon fatally overdosed in 1978. \"I wish we could have saved him,\" said Daltrey. \"I mean, knowing what we know now about drug abuse and rehab and all that, we might have done better.\"\n\nA cocaine-fueled heart attack claimed bassist John Entwistle in 2002.\n\nThat left just Daltrey and Townshend, who don't actually see much of each other these days.\n\nAxelrod asked, \"So after half a century working so closely with this guy, it's never ring him up and go get a beer and talk about life?\"\n\n\"No, [we] don't have that kind of relationship.

If he ever wanted to have it again, he would make an approach but I don't want to play golf.

When asked if he ever saw the inspiration for his memoir's title, Mr. Kibblewhite, again, Daltrey said, \"No. I don't know if he's still alive.\"\n\n\"He must have known Roger Daltrey made something of himself,\" Axelrod said.\n\n\"I said it as, you know, a kind of 'F--- you' moment.

I know he lost his eye in war or whatever.\"\n\nOn Saturday's \"SNL,\" Davidson returned to Weekend Update and offered an apology for the jibe.\n\n\"In what I'm sure is a huge shock for people who know me, I made a poor choice last week,\" Davidson said. \"I made a joke about Lt. Com. Dan Crenshaw, and on behalf of the show and myself, I apologize ... I mean this from the bottom of my heart. It was a poor choice of words. The man is a war hero, and he deserves all the respect in the world.\"\n\nCrenshaw wheeled into frame, thanking Davidson for \"making a Republican look good.\" His phone then rang to the tune of \"Breathin\" by pop star Ariana Grande, who was engaged to Davidson until the two split in October.\n\nCrenshaw took the opportunity to make fun of a photo of Davidson: \"He looks like if the meth from 'Breaking Bad' was a person.\"\n\nThe incoming congressman ended by encouraging viewers to remember the sacrifices of those who served on Veterans Day weekend.\n\n\"Maybe say, 'Thanks for your service.' I would actually encourage you to say something else. Tell a veteran, 'Never forget,'\" Crenshaw said. \"When you say 'never forget' to a veteran, you are implying that, as an American, you are in it with them. Not separated by some imaginary barrier between civilians and veterans, who will never forget the sacrifices made by veterans past and present.\"", "", "", "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says her party's use of subpoena power when Democrats take back control of the House will be \"very strategic.\"\n\nPelosi, who says she believes she will once again be selected by her colleagues as speaker of the House, said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday that Democrats aren't \"scattershot\" and will use their newfound authority carefully.

I knew it wasn't real. I cried myself to sleep so many nights praying, 'God, please change me.'\"\n\nTrimmer grew up outside Richmond, Virginia, struggling to keep a secret from his deeply-religious Southern Baptist parents. \"I was hiding. I was singing at church, I was a missionary. I did everything to try to be the best Christian,\" he told correspondent Erin Moriarty. \"And I would just wake up, and I was still gay.\"\n\nAnd so, at 17, Adam came out to his mother, Paulette. It didn't go well. She recalled, \"He said, 'I am gay. I know I am gay.' And I just turned and looked to the side and tears just rolling down my face. And I looked at him and I said, 'Adam, a man shall not lay with another man.' And he started crying. I wanted him to know that it's in the Bible, and you're going against God.\"\n\nMoriarty asked, \"Did you hug him at that moment?\"\n\n\"No, I did not hug him,\" she replied, crying. \"And I remember hearing him tell someone, 'When I went to my mom, instead of getting love and support, I got religion.'\"\n\nCBS News\n\nA year later, after Adam was also rejected by his first love at college, he attempted suicide. He said, \"I was trying to leave this world. I just wanted to die.\"\n\nWhile in the hospital, a youth pastor suggested a controversial treatment, known as reparative (or conversion) therapy. It was called \"Healing from Homosexuality.\"\n\nEven though it's been 45 years since the American Psychiatric Association determined that homosexuality is not an illness that can be \"cured,\" an estimated 700,000 adults in the U.S. have received some kind of conversion therapy.\n\nAnd yet in some religious communities, conversion therapies and support groups for parishioners who don't want to be gay continue to thrive.\n\n\"Evangelical people essentially believe that homosexuality is a sin. It's a transgression against God's heart and mind,\" said Stan Mitchell, a pastor in Nashville, Tennessee. He told Moriarty that conversion therapy is still used every day to \"save souls,\" even those of children as young as 10.\n\nCBS News\n\n\"These children are dealing with the fear that they might spend eternity tortured because of their natural way of being in the world.\n\n\"So, to ask them, 'Do you want that? Do you wanna be gay?' You're asking them, 'Do you wanna go to hell?'\"\n\nTo avoid that fate, Adam Trimmer asked his family to help him pay for a retreat with an organization called Exodus International. The mission of Exodus, according to Alan Chambers, was \"to help people who were same-sex-attracted to not act on that.\"\n\nExodus was once the leader in the field, in part because of Chambers, its charismatic director, who refused to even say the word \"gay.\" Instead, he would say \"a person with same-sex attractions.\"\n\n\"Why is that better?\" asked Moriarty.\n\n\"Because I felt like even using the word was caving in on something that we shouldn't cave in on,\" Chambers replied.\n\nHe was the organization's best advertisement: he had undergone conversion therapy himself, and now had a wife and two children.\n\nWhen asked if that gave him hope, Adam Trimmer said, \"Absolutely, I looked at it and I said, 'Wow, this can really happen.'\"\n\nThe therapy is based on the belief that homosexuality is caused by nurture, not nature, and so it can be reversed. There are classes (as depicted in the current movie \"Boy Erased\") on how to act less \"gay.\"\n\nTrimmer was also introduced to something called \"cuddle therapy,\" intended to create aversion to another man's touch, by cuddling with a man in bed.\n\nLike most who go through conversion therapy, Trimmer was also told his homosexuality could be traced back to a troubled family relationship, in his case a distant father and over-involved mother.\n\nTrimmer recalled a counseling session which his mother had attended: \"The counselor looked at her and just told her that she was just so overbearing as a mother and that she needed to let me go. And mind you, this is being told to a mother of a son who just tried to kill himself.\"\n\nCBS News\n\nMoriarty asked Paulette, \"What did that therapy do to your relationship with Adam?\"\n\n\"It killed it,\" she replied. \"It all but killed it. He didn't want to have anything to do with me.\"\n\nAlex Cooper says that what she was subjected to when she was 15 almost killed her. Raised in a loving and devout Mormon home in Southern California, when Cooper came out to her parents, they sent her to Utah, to live with a couple recommended by church leaders, who offered unlicensed therapy.\n\nHarperCollins\n\nCooper said, \"I was there to become straight.\"\n\n\"Your parents thought that this couple could turn you straight?\" Moriarty asked.\n\n\"It's wild to think that it's even a thing that goes through people's minds, but it happens every day.\n\n\"At first, it was just meetings, just going through the Gospel and talking about why I was there. This giant, terrible mind game.\"\n\nBut the most unbearable part, Cooper says, was a backpack filled with rocks that she was forced to wear all day, every day. \"I think about 40 pounds,\" she said.\n\nAnd the point of the backpack, she said, was to represent \"the physical burden and pain of being gay.\"\n\nThe so-called therapy didn't change her sexual orientation, but Cooper said it broke her spirit, and after several months, she, too, tried to take her life. \"On my sixteenth birthday, it was kind of like a gift to myself,\" she recalled. \"I just took every pill in the house, and I just remember being so excited to not be there anymore.\"\n\nCBS News\n\nPastor Stan Mitchell, who once himself sent parishioners to conversion therapy, has been speaking out against it since 2015. \"I was a pastor in a megachurch, and I was party to destroying these people,\" he said.\n\nMoriarty asked, \"Do you have any idea of how many young people you had recommended go through conversion therapy?\"\n\n\"I've tried to forget. I've tried to forget,\" Pastor Mitchell replied.\n\nBut he can't forget the damage he's seen. \"In the last four years, I've done at least three or four funerals of people who took their life because of this issue,\" he said.\n\nHe's paid a big price for speaking out; he lost two-thirds of his congregation. \"The only thing I regret is that I didn't do it sooner. People died while I was trying to find courage.\"\n\nAs for the American Medical and Psychological Associations, they warn against the use of conversion therapy. And now, more than a dozen states ban licensed therapists from using those practices on children.\n\nBut some powerful religious organizations, such as Focus on the Family, say the government is going too far. Jeff Johnston, the group's issues analyst, insists people who don't want to be gay \u2014 even children \u2014 have the right to try to change.\n\nCBS News\n\n\"I want people to know that God changes people, that leaving homosexuality is a possibility, and that we should have the freedom to do so,\" Johnston said. \"The Government shouldn't step between me and my counselor. That's not their role.\"\n\n\"But you know the state has the right to limit any kind of therapy when there is some evidence that it can be harmful?\" asked Moriarty.\n\n\"I know there's some outrageous things that happen in life, like backpacks with rocks,\" Johnston said. \"I know that's horrific. But those are such wildly-extreme examples, and that's not what we are talking about in general.\n\n\"I have met dozens and dozens of people who have had deep change and deep transformation,\" Johnston said. \"And that's why we continue to advocate for their freedom.\"\n\nBut even the man who was once the living example of the power of conversion therapy admits he's never seen it work. Alan Chambers told Moriarty, \"It didn't make me straight. Here I am, happily married to a woman for almost 21 years ...\"\n\nZondervan\n\n\"But you're still attracted to men?\" asked Moriarty.\n\n\"Yes, that hasn't gone away, you know? And it won't.\"\n\nChambers shut down Exodus in 2013.\n\nAlex Cooper finally ran away from the home where she was placed, and a Utah judge ruled she could return to her family and live as a gay woman. She is now 23 and shares an apartment with her girlfriend in Portland, Oregon.\n\nMoriarty asked her, \"Where did you get that kind of strength?\"\n\n\"I knew what happy felt like,\" Cooper replied. \"I grew up happy, and I just knew I could have that again.\"\n\nAnd Adam Trimmer quit therapy on his own, and says he is now trying to undo the damage.\n\n\"Today, my mom and I have a restored relationship that conversion therapy tried to take away from us,\" he said. \"And it has been powerful to reconnect with her.\"\n\nMoriarty asked his mother, Paulette, \"You have your church, and your church tells you that homosexuality is wrong. But you've got your son.\"\n\n\"The only way I can answer that is, I love God, I am not going to change that. And I love my son, and I'm not going to change that.\"\n\nCBS News\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Sari Aviv.\n\n\n\nCorrections: In the online article, Adam Trimmer's mother's name was corrected as Paulette.

Senator welcome to \"Face the Nation.\" I want to--\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --get right to it. The French president seemed to be saying the liberal world order is being undermined by forces -- nationalist forces -- that seem to be represented to many by President Trump. Do you agree to- with him?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: No I think he's got a political problem at home Macron does and probably picking a fight with Trump is good politics. I like the idea of President Trump pushing NATO to pay more, getting out of the intermediate ballistic missile treaty with Russia made sense to me because Russia's cheating and the treaty doesn't cover China and North Korea. I think the main friction is getting out of the Iran deal which I thought was bad for America and really bad for the world. So Republican presidents always have a hard time in Europe. I'm not really worried about this at all.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, let's move to what's happening here at home. You're seeing some of the worst fires in California history raging--\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --there--\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Nearly [two] dozen dead yet the president is- is taking an aggressive combative stance here.\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Even threatening to cut off funding. What's achieved by doing things like this?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Well number one my heart goes out to the people who lost their homes I think about 25 people killed these are historically large wildfires in California. But we do have a forest management problem all over the country. We need to address. But you know California will receive the money they need. But going forward we need to look at some of the underlying causes of these fires and it's just not California we need to look at better forest management in terms of federal lands all over the country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you agree with the sentiment but perhaps not the tone is what I hear you saying there.\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. This has been a debate for a while about underbrush clearing--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: --in federally owned lands, but now is not time talk about cutting off money. With all due respect, we're going to help our friends in California. They need help.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you since you sit, and are an important voice, on the Judiciary Committee about what's happening now with the search for the new Attorney General now that Jeff Sessions has been forced out.\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You said you're going to meet with the acting Attorney General this week--\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --are you going to ask him to recuse himself? And is Matthew Whittaker's appointment to this role constitutional?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Good question. I talked with Matt, yesterday. I'm going to meet with him next week when we get our schedules aligned here. I think he's- was appropriately appointed legally. I don't think he has to recuse himself. I am confident the Mueller investigation will be allowed to come to a good solid conclusion, that there'll be no political influence put on Mr. Mueller by Mr. Whitaker to do anything other than Mr. Mueller's job. I'm confident that Mr. Mueller will be allowed to do his job without interference.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I ask you that question because, as you know, there have been a number of public statements made by Whitaker, including saying there's no criminal obstruction of justice charge to be had against--\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --President Trump--\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --that seems prejudicial to many. He's referred to special counsel as the Mueller lynch mob. What about these comments suggest to you that he's going to be impartial?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Well, you don't recuse somebody because they have opinions different than the people they are overseeing. Trust me there is politics abounds when it comes to the Mueller investigation that Trump is guilty and no matter what Mueller finds. But the bottom line here is that Mr. Mueller will be allowed to do his job without political interference by-by Mr. Whitaker. Mr. Whitaker I think is legally qualified and otherwise qualified to oversee this investigation until a new attorney general will be appointed. And I think that will happen early next year.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Early next year, what's your first question for that nominee?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Well, depends on what the lay of the land is. If Mueller is still not finished with this investigation, are you gonna allow him to do his job? But a lot of questions about- about how the Department of Justice works.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN:The president issued an order this week and says he's going to issue another executive order having to do with immigration--\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Does he have the authority to bypass Congress in doing these things?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: You know the 14th Amendment birthright citizenship, that's got to get to the court. Maybe the executive order is the way to start that discussion. But when it comes to changing asylum laws saying that somebody here illegally cannot apply for asylum, I don't know if you can do that by executive order, but I support that policy. Right now people are marching on our border, if they- they cross illegally then they asked for asylum. Asylum shouldn't be a magnet for illegal immigration. So I support the policy change. I'm not so sure you can do it by executive order but we'll see.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well the ACLU suggests that that's actually contravening Congress and established law.\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: I might want to get another- I might want to get another opinion than the ACLU. But the point is that I do believe asylum laws are being abused. They've become magnets for illegal immigration. People cross the border illegally, then apply for asylum. That's not the way asylum is set up to work. I support the policy change. Congress probably should do it, but I'm open minded to the executive order. I- I just don't know the answer really.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You've been speaking a fair amount about what's going on in Florida and the recount there.\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Florida Department of- of- of Elections has presented no evidence whatsoever of criminal activity there.\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The president has been sort of fanning the flames, some would say, of conspiracy here, saying Democrats are trying to steal it. Don't you think in--\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: --Well, I think--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --some ways that this undermines election integrity when you're actually trying to uphold it?\n\nSEN. GRAHAM: I think what undermines election integrity is Broward County can't get their act together over multiple elections. If the Florida law enforcement officials see no fraud, I'll accept that. But they are in violation of the law, Broward County. They're supposed to report results within 30 minutes of the polls closing. They counted almost 80,000 votes days after the polls closed. So the problem is not with President Trump's rhetoric. The problem is with the incompetence and the mischief--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\n\nSEN.

Ted Cruz of Texas that aired Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to another of Tuesday's winners, Texas Republican Ted Cruz, a key member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and he joins us from his home in Houston. Senator, welcome to \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nSENATOR TED CRUZ: Thank you, Margaret. Good morning and- and- and welcome back yourself. Congratulations on your new son.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I appreciate that. Thank you very much. A little bit of history here you were part of President Bush's legal team back in 2000 during the Florida recount. We are looking once again at questions about what is happening and a recount there. What is going on? Is this political conspiracy like the president suggests or is this just incompetence?\n\nSEN. CRUZ: Well listen, I think there is certainly reason to be concerned. Florida's history on recounts has- has not been great. You've got each of the counties there that- that have different- different commissioners. I spoke yesterday with my colleague Marco Rubio who's- who's following what's happening there closely and is- and is deeply concerned that- that- that what might be playing out is as an attempt to steal the election. I hope that's not it. I think everyone needs to be vigilant. Every vote needs to be counted. But at the same time we can't allow people to be stealing votes and we need to be on guard against that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: A bit of both, you say-- it could be getting stolen or it could just be incompetence?\n\nSEN. CRUZ: It- the- the- it could almost always be a bit of both of incompetence and- and the potential for malfeasance. But- but any time you have a recount, you have an invitation for people to- to- to violate the law and try to advance their partisans. In- in 2000, in Bush versus Gore, on election night, George W. Bush had about- a 3,000 vote lead and there ended up being a total of four recounts in Florida over and over and over again, and over the course of those four recounts, Bush's lead dropped from about 3,000 votes all the way down to 537 votes and- and- and the mantra of the Democrats is they wanted to keep counting and counting and counting the same votes over and over again until they managed to drop the votes to the other side. I- I think that suggests if you're recounting, the numbers ought to stay the same or roughly the same and if they're moving consistently in one direction it- it- it suggests you may not have a fair and level playing field in terms of those counting.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you since you're on the Judiciary Committee about what happened this week, Jeff Sessions being forced out. Now there's an acting attorney general overseeing the Russia probe. Do you believe that the special counsel's investigation is now in peril and needs to be protected?\n\nSEN. CRUZ: Well I- I don't think anyone was surprised to see Jeff Sessions move on. Jeff- Jeff is a good man, an honorable man. He's someone who's been a friend a long time. But it was clear that his relationship and the president's relationship were not working, that there was no longer trust and confidence there and- and that's not a long term sustainable situation to have an attorney general and- and a president in-in direct and open conflict the way they were. I think Jeff did a number of very good things at DOJ including on immigration, including on religious liberty, so I'm grateful for those efforts. But I think it will be good to see new leadership come into the Department of Justice. Now Mr. Whitaker, as I understand it, has been appointed just in an acting position and- and the White House has announced they intend to nominate a new attorney general. I- I expect that to happen quickly and when it does, the- the Senate will take up the advise and consent role and- and I'm on the Senate Judiciary Committee so whoever the nominee is, I- I look forward to hearing from that individual, their background, their record, their qualifications, and- and - and their vision for what the Department of Justice should be doing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Should there be legislation to protect the special counsel?\n\nSENATOR CRUZ: No I don't believe there should. We- we- we had a bill come through the Judiciary Committee that tried to make it impossible for a special counsel to be removed. I believe that legislation was unconstitutional, that- that it was inconsistent with Article II of the Constitution.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You were very critical of the Obama administration for taking action via executive fiat as you said, you called it dangerous. This week President Trump on immigration has issued orders bypassing Congress to restrict how migrants crossing the border illegally can claim asylum. Are you OK with that now?\n\nSENATOR CRUZ: Well I'm still studying this specific immigration order but- but I'll tell you look here's my view on executive orders--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But bypassing Congress?--\n\nSEN. CRUZ: Well let- let me explain my view on- on executive orders whether from Trump or Obama, George W. Bush or anybody else, which is there is a legitimate role for an executive order and that is governing how the Executive Branch operates. How under Article II of the Constitution the president of the Executive Branch is charged with- with taking- taking due care that the laws are faithfully executed. And an executive order is perfectly appropriate to direct the Executive Branch, this is the manner in which we shall execute the law. What Obama did repeatedly that was so lawless is his executive orders didn't do that. Instead they said here is the federal law passed by Congress signed by the president that we will defy, that we will ignore, and- and that the president can't do. And- and so that's the question on any executive order is-is it- is it directing how the executive will behave or is it flying in defiance to- to laws passed by Congress. If it's the latter it's unconstitutional.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So I- I don't hear a clear answer on whether you think this asylum change is OK. Do you think via executive order, it is appropriate for the president to end birthright citizenship, again bypassing Congress?\n\nSEN. CRUZ: Well- well- well Margaret as I said on- on the- on the executive order on immigration I have not studied that order yet, it just came out this week. You know I have to admit I- I was kind of busy, we had an election a couple of days ago. And- and- and that- that so, I have not yet reviewed the executive order, and I try on legal decisions - my career has been being a constitutional litigator, so I- I don't- I don't reach constitutional opinions lightly. If the order defies the laws of Congress, then yes it's unconstitutional. If the order constrains and directs how the executive will implement the law then it's not. Now my understanding is this executive order does things directing resources to the border. Those resources are clearly within the purview of an executive order for the president --\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And birthright citizenship executive order that's coming--\n\nSEN. CRUZ: And the president is charged under existing law-- The- The president is charged under executive un-under federal law with securing the border, and if the executive order is in furtherance of the statute then it's not only allowable, it- it- it's appropriate and good. I mean this so-called migrant caravan of- of over 10,000 people marching North, declaring their intention to cross the border illegally. I can tell you I told the president just recently when he and I spoke. I said Mr. President under no circumstances should we let them cross, we should use whatever tools are available, whether it is border patrol whether it is National Guard whether- whether it is the military that the president has called up, but we shouldn't allow 10,000 people to blatantly and deliberately violate the law. There is a right way to come to this country and- and that's following the law, waiting in line and following the rules.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Alright, well, we look forward to hearing your views on birthright citizenship and those asylum decisions. We've got to leave it here, senator. We will be back with a lot more Face The Nation. Don't go away.", "", "The following is a transcript of the interview with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi that aired Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, we sat down with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is working to round up the votes among Democrats to become Speaker once again. We began our discussion with the Democrats' call for the new acting attorney general to recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller probe after the president asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to step aside last week.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think under Whitaker that the integrity of this investigation is in peril?\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: Yes I do. First of all, I think that he should recuse himself for any review of the investigation because of statements he has made already in the public domain about the fact that this investigation should not-\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You don't have confidence in him as America's top enforcement officer?\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: No I don't, and don't just take it from me. There's bipartisan editorializing about this that- that he should never have been appointed and that it- it does violence to the Constitution and the vision of our founders to appoint such a person in such a manner to be the chief legal officer in our country. And that's bipartisan.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There are questions about what will happen when Bob Mueller wraps up his investigation, the report and the conclusions he comes to, and whether they will ever see the light of day, because we don't know if they're going to be shared with Congress. In a Democrat controlled House with subpoena power would you force that?\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: Well we don't know if- if- the- what he will decide and what will be made public. But we do want the truth.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --The public has a right to know--\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: The public has a right to know and no one is above the law in terms of our having access to that information.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't think it would require a subpoena to the DOJ to release it?\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: Well let us hope not but the Congress- the beauty of our Constitution is the system of checks and balances. And in doing so to have oversight responsibility, to be a check. So in our oversight responsibilities we would want that information.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What are the bounds of that oversight? Because, you know, one of the concerns you hear is Democrats are just going to issue subpoena after subpoena and make the president's life legally more difficult. Is there a limitation to that that you see?\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: Well we are responsible. We are not scattershot. We are not doing any investigation for a political purpose, but to seek the truth. So I think a word that you could describe about how Democrats will go forward in this regard is we will be very strategic.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: No investigation for political purposes you say--\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: --that's right--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: A number of Republicans would say, \"Come on.\" There's always a- a political upside or downside to moving forward with some of these investigations.\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: Well if the Republicans would say that they're just projecting their own attitude toward investigations, which was very political. We are coming to do something that is very important for our country; a more open Congress with accountability to the public, with a seeking bipartisanship where we can find it, stand our ground where we can't.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The president has been saying that there's election fraud in Florida. What do you think is happening in- in Broward County? Is this election fraud, and is there a role that Congress needs to play in upgrading election infrastructure?\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: Well, yes to the second part, but let's go to the first part first. My experience with the president is that any time he charges somebody with something, he's just projecting what he might have done himself. We are not--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Election fraud?\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: Well obstruction- suppression of the vote. Those- those kinds of issues I think are wrong and not in honor of our sacred right to vote. So no, there is no election fraud. What there is is an honest count of the vote.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: On immigration, would you try to block any attempt to fund the border wall?\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: Let's just enlarge that issue into what we need to do as a country. We certainly have to protect our borders, and Democrats know that, and we have always worked to do that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you'd be open to supporting this--\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: --No, I'm saying that I would--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --As Speaker, would you ever--\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: --I support protecting--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- shepherd that legislation?\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: --protecting our border, and we have done that, and there are many ways to protect the border before tens of billions of dollars building a wall where technology and personnel and the rest could possibly do the job. But whatever it is has to be tied to comprehensive immigration reform. What this administration has done is undermining our values. Taking babies out of the arms of their moms -- as you, a new mom, you understand that bonding very well, with me a- as my- mother of five, grandmother of nine, understand that bonding very well. Let's take the baby out of the arms of their moms. Let's separate families. Shameful. And what the president just did in the last day on the executive order flies in the face of even what the evangelicals, who are his big supporters, have said. Evangelicals have said the United States amnesty- excuse me- The United States Refugee Resettlement Program is the crown jewel of America's humanitarianism. And what the president did does not recognize what the law of the land is and- in terms of refugees.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But Speaker Pelosi, if you're Speaker, as you said you were confident you will be--\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: --Yes--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --would not, in principle, oppose a border wall. You would have the conversation if it's part of comprehensive immigration reform?\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: No, I- I- I- I didn't say that. I didn't say that. I said that we- we think there are better ways to protect the border, but everything that we do is related to how many people we protect in our country in terms of comprehensive- comprehensive immigration reform. Remember the president says, \"I'm going to build a wall and Mexico is going to pay for it.\" Well, it's tens of billions of dollars. But it- again, I think it's wrong. I don't think it's effective. I think it's costly, and I think it- it- there's a better way to protect our border.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot more of our interview with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi ahead, including her plans for fixing the Affordable Care Act and the record number of women in the next Congress. That's coming up in our next half hour.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We want to continue our conversation with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. In the next Congress, there will be at least 100 women in the House; that's a record. We asked Leader Pelosi about the new freshman class.\n\nHOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADER NANCY PELOSI: We got 23 women, got us to the majority. And then we have many men, some of people of color among those men. It's to take us to bigger heights. I want to salute the quality of our candidates who- who took their message, their \"why\" \u2013 why they wanted to be in Congress, what they cared about, and what they knew about that, and how they connected in a very personal way with their constituents. They- we own the ground because people were inspired by them, and the outside groups did so much \u2013 door to door, telling stories about health care and why that was important in this election, and so many other personal stories. So, personal stories won the day. Health care was the big issue. I'm here to protect that health care. In terms of the diversity, we used to be over 50 percent women, people of color and LGBTQ. Now we're over 60 percent and that's a- a beautiful thing, that diversity for our country. The additional people who will be- who will change the face of security in our country and of our- not only our national security, but our- our- our national economy. People say, \"Oh you're going to have more women so you'll have more emphasis on child care.\" Well, we already have that, and we'll do more. But the- the point is, is that every issue is a women's issue.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: One of the issues that Democrats campaigned on was protection of the existing healthcare law--\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Republicans and the president have talked about preexisting conditions and something they want to actually protect. So what does that actually mean in practical sense? Do you think that there is any room for reform of ACA \u2013 of Obamacare?\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: Well you have two different questions. One is the- the preexisting condition as a- not being a barrier to getting coverage is part of the Affordable Care Act. The Republicans have tried to disrupt that. They did it in their \"Trumpcare\" or \"I don't care\" bill that he had, and it was defeated. They now are going- they didn't succeed in the Congress. So now they're going to the courts, and a large number of Republican attorneys general throughout the country have brought suit against the preexisting condition benefit. And instead of protecting the law of the land the president has sided with those attorneys general who want to eliminate that benefit. They misrepresented during the campaign where they were on this. They have another chance now, with us in the majority, to join us into removing all doubt that the pre-existing medical condition is the law- the benefit- is the law of the land.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Does this change anything for you, in terms of your- your sense of needing to stay here or--\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: But I- the- I- the more--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --needing to stay as Speaker?\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: Well, I- I'm staying as Speaker to protect the Affordable Care Act. That's my main issue, because I think that's, again, about the health and financial health of the America's families and if Hillary had won, I could go home. Nobody from California ever gets Potomac fever. You may know that. But--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --That's still your north star right now, though?\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: What?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The protection of the Affordable Care--\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: --Yes, that--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Act?\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: That- that- I mean, I- I hope we will have a- a- a woman president very soon, but that's not the- the- the fact that we almost had one would have been motivation for me to say, \"There's a woman at the table.\" It's very important. You cannot have the four leaders of Congress, the President of the United States, these five people, and not have the voice of women. Especially since women were the majority of the- the voters, the workers in campaigns, and now part of this glorious victory. But these women bring each their individual- individual excellence to the Congress, and we're very proud of it. When I came to Congress, there were 12 Democratic women. I said, \"We have to change this.\" Now we'll have close to 90. And that's a- a major accomplishment for- for the American people, but also for the Congress.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: How do you respond to those who say there still needs to be more diversity in the leadership, either age wise, because you look at- at the other two leaders alongside you in- 78 years old--\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: --Yeah, well that's a--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you need to have some of these new progressives who've come in younger--\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: We've had them. We have had them--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --in leadership?\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: --in the leadership along the way, and that more will be in now that we have more positions. When you have- when you have the majority, you have more positions to put people in leadership. But our leadership doesn't just extend to the caucus chair, vice chair, all that. It's about the leadership of our committees. And in our leadership of our committees, we have beautiful diversity \u2013 women, people of color, LGBTQ. It's a- it's a sight to behold, to see all of that diversity, all of that talent leading the way. And some of the people here like being a chair more than they'd rather be chair of the caucus, they would be the chair of the Armed Services Committee or chair of the Financial Services Committee--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And that's how you would resolve these questions?\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: Well it's- it- people have to run. When I first ran, people said, \"Who said she could run?\" Nobody smoothed a path for me. I've tried to smooth the path for others, but you have to run, you have to want to do it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Policy wise, what does that mean?\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: Policy wise that means that the face of national security in our country will be very different and very diverse. We have many women coming in with experience in national security. We have many women here moving up in the ranks on national security, but I want to make sure that everybody has a security credential, whether it's- in all of different committees of jurisdiction in that regard. It also means that women will be taking the lead on our- our economy, the strength of our economy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: When you said you're a transitional figure. Is that what you're transitioning towards? Handing off to these women?\n\nDEMOCRATIC LEADER PELOSI: Well I've always considered myself a transitional figure. I am on a mission and that mission was to honor what we did with the Affordable Care Act. It-it stands with Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid as pillars of economic, as well as health security for the American people. When we had the opportunity to do it we fought hard, and we won, and now we have to protect it, not just as a legislative matter, but as what it means in the lives of the American people. And so I-I think we're on a good path to- to protect it. It was the central issue in this campaign. And so many of the outside groups told their stories, walked their precincts, won their votes, for us to preserve and protect the Affordable Care Act and improve it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with our panel.", "", "PARIS \u2014 President Trump paid tribute Sunday to U.S. and allied soldiers killed in World War I as he and dozens of other world leaders commemorated the 100th anniversary of the end of \"a horrible, horrible war\" that marked America's emergence as a world power.\n\n\"We are gathered together at this hallowed resting place to pay tribute to the brave Americans who gave their last breath in that mighty struggle,\" Mr. Trump said at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in the suburbs of Paris, where more than 1,500 Americans who died in the war are buried.\n\n\"It is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended and to protect the peace they so nobly gave their lives to secure one century ago,\" he said.\n\nAP\n\nThe Veterans Day speech came a day after Mr. Trump was criticized for failing to visit a different American cemetery about 60 miles outside of Paris Saturday because rain grounded the helicopter he had planned to take.

Ian David Long, a 28-year-old ex-Marine machine-gunner, fatally shot 11 people at the Borderline Bar and Grill and a police officer who responded Wednesday.\n\nThe officer exchanged gunfire with Long, who was found dead at the scene. An autopsy determined Long fatally shot himself, Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub said Saturday.\n\nAuthorities have yet to determine a motive and are exploring all possibilities. Among them is whether Long believed a former girlfriend might have been at the bar, which was filled with about 150 people on its popular college night that attracts students from several nearby schools.\n\nSheriff's Capt. Garo Kuredjian said investigators were still interviewing witnesses, have served a search warrant at Long's home and searched the car Long drove to the bar.\n\n\"We're going to exhaust every investigative means possible,\" Kuredjian told the Ventura County Star.\n\nKuredjian said there is no timeline for completing the investigation. The analysis of items obtained in the searches could take months, he said.\n\nFormer Sheriff Geoff Dean, whose last day on the job was Friday, said investigators believe Long targeted the bar but don't know why. At least a half-dozen people interviewed by The Associated Press who described themselves as regulars at the bar don't ever recall seeing Long there.\n\nAuthorities described an attack of military efficiency . When Long shot his .45-caliber pistol, he killed. All of the injured suffered cuts, bruises and other minor injuries in frantic attempts to escape the gunfire. Some smashed windows and jumped out.\n\nBased on time stamps, investigators said, Long posted to Instagram during the attack. Social media platforms have scrubbed that and any other posts following Wednesday night's massacre. But one law enforcement official said Long posted about his mental state and whether people would believe he was sane.\n\nThe official, who was briefed on the investigation but not authorized to discuss it publicly, spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nLong grew up in Thousand Oaks and several people who knew him described him in disturbing terms. Long made others feel uncomfortable going back to his teens.\n\nDominique Colell, who coached girls' track and field at the high school where Long was a sprinter, remembers an angry young man who could be verbally and physically combative. In one instance, Colell said Long used his fingers to mimic shooting her in the back of the head as she talked to another athlete. In another, he grabbed her rear and midsection after she refused to return a cellphone he said was his.\n\n\"I literally feared for myself around him,\" Colell said in an interview Friday. \"He was the only athlete that I was scared of.\"\n\nPolice said Long had no criminal record. There were rumors Long suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. Donald Macleud could hear loud arguments across his backyard fence.\n\n\"He was a lot worse when he came back from the military,\" Macleud said. \"I suspected he had a gun there because I heard a gunshot one night, over a year ago.\"\n\nDuring one disturbance, neighbor Tom Hanson took action. \"I called the police on him that time,\" he said, \"just because I didn't know if he was hurting himself.\"\n\nDeputies responded and a mental health specialist who assessed Long worried he might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder but found no grounds to hospitalize him.", "", "", "", "KINSHASA, Congo \u2014 Congo's current Ebola outbreak is the worst in the country's recorded history with 319 confirmed and probable cases, the health ministry said.

Two of our colleagues in the Rapid Response Medical Unit even lost their lives in an attack.\"\n\nArmed groups vying for control of Congo's mineral-rich east have staged regular attacks in Congo's Ituri and North Kivu provinces, complicating the response by health officials who are also meeting community resistance.\n\nHealth officials, however, have managed to vaccinate more than 27,000 high-risk contacts, of which at least half could have developed Ebola, the health minister said.\n\n\"This epidemic remains dangerous and unpredictable, and we must not let our guard down. We must continue to pursue a very dynamic response that requires permanent readjustments and real ownership at the community level,\" he said.\n\nThe head of U.N. peacekeeping operations vowed this week to do more with Congo's government to help improve security in the country's east.\n\nThis is the first time an Ebola outbreak has occurred in Congo's far northeast. The health ministry has said teams responding to the Ebola outbreak are attacked three or four times a week on average, a level of violence unseen in the country's nine previous outbreaks of the virus. Ebola is spread via the body fluids of infected people, including the dead.", "", "A pair of Harvard scientists say a massive, fast-moving visitor to our solar system may have been a probe sent by an alien civilization. Most astronomers believe Oumuamua \u2013 Hawaiian for \"messenger\" or \"scout\" \u2013 is a comet or an asteroid, except a half a mile long. But there are things about its behavior they can't quite explain. Enter two Harvard scientists with an idea even they admit is a little out there, reports CBS News correspondent Tony Dokoupil.\n\nWhen Oumuamua was discovered last October, it was tumbling past the sun at 196,000 mph. To some the reddish object looked like a cigar. Others thought it was shaped like a pancake.\n\n\n\n\"It looks very different from objects that we have found in the solar system,\" said Avi Loeb, chair of the Harvard University astronomy department. Loeb said Oumuamua did not behave like an ordinary asteroid or give off gas like a comet.\n\n\"There seemed to be an extra force that is pushing it, and it's not clear what this push is from,\" he added.\n\nIn an upcoming paper, he and colleague offer what they call a \"more exotic scenario... Oumuamua may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to earth vicinity by an alien civilization.\"\n\nAccording to their calculations, Oumuamua is less than a millimeter thin, but very wide like a sail, harnessing solar radiation to propel itself \u2013 similar to the spaceship used by Count Dooku in the \"Star Wars\" films.\n\n\"I just want everybody to take that with a gigantic grain of salt,\" said Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History. She said Oumuamua didn't emit any signals suggesting it was a space craft.\n\n\"If you say that the top 10 list of explanations does not include alien probe, what is on that list of top 10 explanations?\" Dokoupil asked.\n\n\"It's a comet. Or an asteroid. Or a rock,\" Faherty said.\n\n\"So where is alien civilization on the list of explanations?\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't know. Real low. Real low. Real, real low,\" Faherty said.\n\nFaherty doubts Oumuamua's appearance means we're on the verge of an alien encounter like the one in the movie, \"Arrival.\"\n\n\"Oumuamua, as it stands, is a phenomenal discovery and a really important object for astronomers to study and for the public to get excited about,\" Faherty said. \"It's OK that it's not aliens.\"\n\n\n\nOumuamua is now so far away we can no longer see it with our satellites. Faherty did have a theory on why we keep coming up with these exotic explanations: As hard as it is to fathom the existence of aliens, it's apparently even harder to fathom the idea that we're alone.\n\n", "", "", ""]
