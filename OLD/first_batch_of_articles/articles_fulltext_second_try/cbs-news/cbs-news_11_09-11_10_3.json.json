["", "bad url", "This 94-year-old's journey from Pennsylvania all the way to a tiny grave in Cologne, Germany, is deeply personal. \"I'm sorry Katharina. I never forget you,\" whispered Clarence Smoyer.\n\nHe never met Katharina Esser. Yet, always feared her death might be his fault.\n\n\"What were you thinking when you were at her grave?\" asked correspondent Seth Doane.\n\n\"I ask her forgiveness if it was my shot that harmed her,\" Smoyer replied.\n\nCBS News\n\nIt was a shot that still haunts him, more than 70 years after he fired it in World War II.\n\nCBS News\n\nAt the time, Smoyer was a gunner with the U.S. Army's 3rd Armored Division. He'd come ashore in Normandy three weeks after D-Day, criss-crossed France and Belgium, and in March of 1945, the fight to capture the key city of Cologne lay ahead:\n\n\"Our lieutenant got on the radio and he said, 'Gentlemen, I give you Cologne. Let's knock the hell out of it,'\" Smoyer said.\n\nIncredibly, Army photographer Jim Bates, who was documenting the Allied advance, filmed Smoyer's Pershing tank in a battle with a German Panzer \u2013 a fight that's now seared into Smoyer's mind: \"I saw movement over my left side,\" he recalled. \"I fired armor-piercing shells through the corner of the building, thinking maybe I'd get a lucky hit that would knock the tank out. This little German car came around the corner right down the street in front of us, and I think I may have been the one who hit the car and wounded Katharina.\"\n\nKatharina Esser was a grocery store clerk.\n\n\"A young girl was taken out and lying in the street there,\" Smoyer said. \"Still alive, but she was shot in the chest. I saw the medics were there and treated here, and left her lying beside the car. She didn't deserve to die in that way.\n\n\"All the time I see her, I see her lying in the street.\"\n\nNational Archives\n\nDoane went back to that street, now bustling, with Smoyer. To him it was almost unrecognizable.\n\nHe said it was the film that jogged his memory. He admits he's a little confused between what he recalls from that day versus what he later saw in that film stored away for decades at the National Archives.\n\n\"I could see her hair,\" he said. \"And I remember seeing her eyes blink.\"\n\nHistorian Adam Makos is author of the book, \"Spearhead\" (out in February), which chronicles Clarence Smoyer's battles through Europe. \"He had heard somebody said, 'Hey, they've uncovered the film of the 3rd Armored Division fighting in Cologne and I think that's your tank.' And he plugged it into his VHS player, and the war came back to him.\"\n\nBallantine Books\n\n\"Clarence had seen a lot of death and destruction, but it was this moment in Cologne that stayed with him,\" said Doane.\n\n\"I think there was something about Cologne,\" said Makos. \"It's the narrow streets. I mean, it was close urban warfare. They're worried about Germans dug into the basement. You have German soldiers and snipers moving through tunnels, through the walls of the houses, and then on top of that you have to worry about a German tank coming around the corner.\"\n\nInside the German tank, which also fired toward Esser's car, was bow gunner Gustav Schaefer, whom Smoyer met years after the war, and befriended. The former fighters from both sides were united by the fear they'd been the one who'd killed Katharina Esser.\n\nWhile working on the book, Adam Makos also developed a friendship with Smoyer, and tried to help the man he sees as a war hero come to terms with the past.\n\n\"And so the more he watches the film, the more he replays it in his mind, the deeper it sinks, and now it's part of him,\" said Makos. \"You don't think a WWII veteran as holding onto something like this. But they suffered just like the guys in the modern wars.\"\n\nHe set up a dinner in Cologne so Smoyer could meet some of Katharina Esser's extended family, including her niece, Leni, who's 83.\n\nThey shared stories, and toasted to her memory.\n\n\"How should I say? History becomes real,\" said Mark Hieronimus, who has a Ph.D. in history, and is a relative of Esser's.\n\n\"It was a nice friendly meeting, but this is a man who was responsible for taking the life of your great aunt?\" asked Doane.\n\n\"Yes. Yes, and no. Is there really [responsibility] in a war like the Second World War? There's never been a war like this before, and no again. Is there responsibility for the death of one person? I don't think so.\"\n\nMore than 70 years later, on what he acknowledged was likely his last trip, Smoyer went up to the top of Cologne's cathedral, to look over a now-peaceful city that's been rebuilt.\n\nDown in the nave of the cathedral, he took another moment to reflect, and to light a candle. \"I ask her forgive me if it was my shots that harmed her,\" he said.\n\nCBS News\n\nDoane said, \"You probably have to forgive yourself.\"\n\n\"Yeah \u2026 it just don't go away.\"\n\nHe still has nightmares, and admits there are still tears. This veteran is proud of his service, but says the battle never truly goes away.\n\nREAD A EXCERPT: \"Spearhead: The World War II Odyssey of an American Tank Gunner\"\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Jane Whitfield.", "President Trump is receiving some criticism on social media for not finding a way to visit a cemetery in France for Americans killed in World War I. Mr. Trump was to visit the the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery at Belleau Wood on Saturday, but the White House canceled the trip because of bad weather, which grounded the presidential helicopter that was to fly him to Belleau, outside of Paris. The White House sent a delegation that included chief of staff John Kelly in his place.\n\n\n\nDavid Frum, a frequent Trump critic who was once a speechwriter for President George W.

It takes place in 1989, it's based on my grandmother and my family, and it's about her last years trying to hold onto her life and her gallery as she kind of slips away. She's got dementia, and it's about how she tries to hang on to what she's got, and how her family, her daughter and grandson and all them cope with this extremely difficult end of life.\n\nALTSCHUL: Is it your most autobiographical work?\n\nLONERGAN: [As Matthew Broderick put it], it's my most literally autobiographical work. The details are all very much drawn from my experience and from my family. And all the characters are very closely modeled on my family. There's a character who's a painter who's inspired by a real guy, but his personality bears no resemblance to the real guy, who I didn't know that well. That character's somewhat invented. But it's a play. It's not a memoir. But it is a memoir play, I guess! (CHUCKLES)\n\nALTSCHUL: You said she was a lover of life and people, more than the art and the gallery.\n\nLONERGAN: She lived for company and for society \u2013 I mean the society of others, not \"high society.\" Her apartment was a social hub in the '40s, '50s and '60s. I think more the '50s. She was a big Village leftie. She was kind of a soft communist, I like to describe her. She wasn't, like, a hard-core political person, but she was always very active in politics. She was a member of the American Labor Party. She did a lot of work on housing issues. She was somehow connected in with real estate, as she always found apartments for everyone, her friends and family I mean. This was all before I was born, so I don't know all the details.\n\nALTSCHUL: But she was an extraordinary woman.\n\nFamily Photo\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah, she was amazing. She was very, very gregarious. She really liked to talk to people and she really liked to talk. And then when she got older she became deaf and her mind started to fall away, and so it became harder for her to enjoy the main thing in life that she liked, which was to connect with people and to talk to them. She started to talk at them, and it became harder and harder for her to be engaged in the world the way she wanted to be. And also 'cause people tend to push older people aside when they start to slip away. And it's unfortunate, 'cause people kind of hasten an end that's inevitable and doesn't have to be quite as separate. People don't quite have to be as separated from the company of others as sometimes we separate them, in this culture anyway.\n\nALTSCHUL: And the gallery itself, there wasn't much going on there in the end.\n\nLONERGAN: No.\n\nALTSCHUL: But she was going there.\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah, she went there all the time. She doesn't do it to make money, but it's a way to spend her time. And for years it was a really functioning local, Greenwich Village gallery, which doesn't really exist anymore, I guess. The real estate wasn't sky-high in those days. She rented the gallery from the early '60s to the late '80s, right before the kind of gentrification and real estate boom really hit the Village. She leased the space from the hotel. But not for a lot of money, I don't think. And then they kicked her out. I think this happens a lot. You know, kind of the rug's pulled out from under you before you're ready, and before it needs to be. And in the play the gallery's taken away before she's really ready to get out of it, and it seems so gratuitous, 'cause she would have been gone a year later anyway. And just to hasten the inevitable by kind of taking people away from their homes and away from their lives because they become an inconvenience, is really not great.\n\nCBS News\n\nALTSCHUL: When did the idea kind of start saying, \"I'm a play\"?\n\nLONERGAN: As I recall, a couple of years after my grandmother died, I think, or shortly afterwards. She died two years after she moved in with my mother and out of her apartment where she'd been for 30 years. I rented an apartment in the back of the building she owned. So I was there for her last two years.\n\nALTSCHUL: And you were caring for her, in some ways, during that time?\n\nLONERGAN: Peripherally. I was there. She rang the bell, I could check in. My mother really took care of her, but my mother lived uptown and I was on the scene, so I was \u2013\n\nALTSCHUL: So, you would have to say, \"Mom, things have progressed here. We need help now\"?\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah, and I'd check in on her like that. But it wasn't, like, I was 25 or 26. I wasn't, like, a saint, spending all my time taking care of her. But I was there a lot. This really painful final experience of hers happened right in my face, basically. Just the last couple years of her functioning where, you know, it's a very slow, gradual decline. We don't even know if she had Alzheimer's or vascular dementia or what it was. Alzheimer's wasn't quite coined as the catch-all for most forms of dementia. That would come a couple of years later. But in any case, I mean people were still using the word senile, which has gone out of fashion now.\n\nALTSCHUL: I guess what I'm asking is, why write it?\n\nLONERGAN: I don't know.\n\nALTSCHUL: I mean, it's painful to think about and talk about and to watch. Why?\n\nLONERGAN: I think because it was painful. I was young. I hadn't had a lot of life experience. You know, had had some close friends who were older go through real difficult medical situations. My best friend's father died quite young, and I was there for a lot of that.\n\nBut I hadn't had a lot of bad life experience. I grew up pretty easy circumstances. And this was a big deal for me. Anyway, it seemed like this enormous thing that I really didn't know what to make of.\n\nALTSCHUL: So when you find yourself in those situations, then you say, \"I'm gonna write this. I'm gonna put this on paper and then I can grapple with it better\u2014\"?\n\nLONERGAN: I think so. You don't really choose. You do feel like the subject is something you really have to put on paper, and you don't know why all the time.\n\nALTSCHUL: Once you've written something and put it down on paper, does it then inhabit a separate space from your memory? Is it a kind of a separation? Or is it still all blended together?\n\nLONERGAN: It does. It's funny, though, because it's still attached to the real events that inspire it. But it does also become a play, you know? Or a film.\n\nAnd this play particularly has a real strong presence as just flat-out memories. When I watch the play, I'm watching these actors in this story and this theatricalization of it, but I think of the actual events that it mirrors just as often, which is not quite the case with my other work, which is a little bit less literally transcribed from my life. But also I was trying to do with the \u2013 it's always weird to talk about your own work.\n\nALTSCHUL: Thank you for indulging us!\n\nLONERGAN: No, no. It's not that. Just you feel you do want it to stand on its own and not require your descriptions of it. But it also is sort of the idea of an attempt to do a play in some kind of documentary theatricalization, 'cause it's very literal, and the events are not written in any way as to try to compress or bend the reality to make it more like a story.\n\nIt's a funny word to use, but there's something fun for me about tryin' to put it down as if you looked into the room, that's exactly what you would see. You wouldn't see anything bigger or smaller than real life, and yet if you can tell a story with a beginning, middle and an end in that aesthetic, then that's quite interesting to try to do. And it's interesting for the actors and the director to try to make that come to life. And that's quite fun to do even if the material is painful.\n\nCBS News\n\nALTSCHUL: Yeah. It's difficult, I imagine.\n\nLONERGAN: It is difficult. But it's interesting. In a funny way, your memories of something you're using directly, if you're pulling actual memories or experiences into the material, and pulling invented people and events into the material, in a funny way it's the same function. It's just you have to invent less when you're using real life. And real life is richer usually than your imagination. If you borrow a character from your life, you can borrow their entire biography. You can know a lot more about them they you might know about a character that you have invented.\n\nOr if you combined people, it's very easy to pull details. This one person's father was a professor and his mother came from Ireland. And you know, you have this information about the person in the back of your head while you're writing the person's dialogue. And it may never appear in the material, but you have it feeding everything that they say and do.\n\nALTSCHUL: So the constraints of the facts kind of give you freedom to explore the little details?\n\nLONERGAN: Well, it gives you backup. They give you backup and depth. And the more you can draw from your life, as they say, the less you have to invent.\n\nAnd her personality is very vivid. And you know, I think a lot of her impressiveness is there, and her zest for being alive and involved and all of her unique qualities are on display, I suppose. And I'm sure she'd love that Elaine May was playing her. I'm sure she'd get kick outta that.\n\nALTSCHUL: It was 20 years ago that you were writing \"The Waverly Gallery.\" As far as caring for elderly and people with dementia, aging people with Alzheimer's or any of these diseases, not much has changed today.\n\nLONERGAN: Oh, I'm afraid that's true. Yeah, I'm sure that's true. I think it's just really difficult. You know, you feel like there are these options and none of them lead to a good place. It's really hard to take care of someone all day long. Even if you have the wherewithal to do it, it's almost impossible. It's very expensive to pay for someone else to do it. It's very painful to put someone you love in a hospital or a nursing home, which is essentially a hospital. Most people don't like being in those facilities. Most of those facilities aren't so great. People who are lucky who don't mind being in them and the ones that are very nice, if you can afford them, are great. Not to quote myself, but there's a moment in the play when the narrator, the grandson says, \"It feels like there's some option, but you just can't figure out what it is.\"\n\nAnd I think the main thing about it is that the person is still as alive as you are, and they can't be relegated into the status of an invalid. They wanna be involved. They wanna be alive. They don't understand that they don't understand. And they don't see themselves as someone who should be put on the shelf. And so that's who you're dealing with, and they have to be treated with that respect at the same time you have to take care of them.\n\nALTSCHUL: And as someone who you love, dearly, the person is still in there, even though things are scrambled.\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah. And you kinda wanna say, \"Where are you?\" But then sometimes they just reach out and there they are.\n\nALTSCHUL: Yes.\n\nLONERGAN: And that's when it's a bit tricky, if you're on the inside, to say, \"Well, that's okay. We'll just set them up in this \u2026. I'll visit once a week or I'll--\" but often you have to do that, because there's no other practical way.\n\nAnd that's the other thing that I'm interested in, anyway, is that a lot of these big situations come down to practicalities, like who can be there at 5:00? How are we gonna get her to go to the bathroom without embarrassing her? How are we gonna make sure, the person might not wanna take a shower, or they take too many, you know? Or the locks on the doors, the gas on the stove, or just arrangements of who's gonna take so-and-so to the doctor, to the eye doctor, and that becomes a big part of your life. And it's something that's kinda skipped over often times.\n\nALTSCHUL: Yes. And their loneliness, their isolation, their confusion, their anxiety, real and unreal. All of those things that you touch on in this are really, it's heavy. And funny, yreah.\n\nLONERGAN: There's all these attachments. You know, it's not just awful. Like, people, their good strengths come out not in a sentimental way, but in a real inspiring way. People really work hard to help take care of their loved ones everywhere, all over the world. And really the bonds are very strong. It doesn't make it okay when things go badly, but it is something that is beautiful that's brought out when these very difficult things happen.\n\nALTSCHUL: Yeah, the ties within the family were beautiful in the short hand. And the moments where there's, you know, laughter or that easiness or understanding.\n\nWhy did you want to bring this back now?\n\nLONERGAN: Well, you want your plays to have a life. You don't want them to be done once and forgotten. I would have brought it back earlier, if the circumstances had lined up. It's hard to get these productions up. And mainly you wanna get a great person in the lead role, and that's where Elaine May comes in.\n\nBrigitte Lacombe\n\nALTSCHUL: Would you have brought it back without her?\n\nLONERGAN: I would have tried to. She was my first choice. She was all of our first \u2013 all of our-- the first choice of all of us. I'm not sure what the grammar is there! (LAUGHTER) But she's a genius, and she's incredible in the part, and I always wanted her to play this role.\n\nALTSCHUL: Why was she perfect for it?\n\nLONERGAN: She's a brilliant woman. She's really funny. She's really smart. She's a great actor. Her moment to moment reality in the play is remarkable. She's incredibly insightful and she's a lotta fun. And she belongs in this world, even though she's nothing like my grandmother and the character is her invention, really. There are places where there's this uncanny resonance that's both Elaine, the character she's playing, and my grandmother. And I don't know how she does that.\n\nALTSCHUL: Just speakin' through her, right--?\n\nLONERGAN: She's incredible.\n\nALTSCHUL: \"Waverly\" opened to critically great reviews. It's been a box office hit. What would your grandmother say? (LAUGHS)\n\nLONERGAN: I don't think she'd be too happy!\n\nALTSCHUL: She wouldn't?\n\nLONERGAN: No, I mean the play is about her at a age she wouldn't wanna be seen at, and a state of mind she wouldn't want anyone to be witness to.\n\nALTSCHUL: Right.\n\nLONERGAN: I'm sure she'd love something that was about her in her heyday, but I don't think she would enjoy this at all. Although she'd be very happy for me. She might be able to put her personal feelings aside. (CHUCKLES)\n\nALTSCHUL: You mentioned that you were living next door to her. How did you say yes? \"Yeah, I'm gonna live in grandma's building. I'm movin' in\"?\n\nLONERGAN: It was a great apartment! I was outta college, and was living in an apartment on Bank Street that I was subletting from my brother-in-law. And my grandmother owned this eight-unit building in the Village and this huge apartment in the back, which was $900 a month in 1986, which was a lot for me, became available, 'cause the guy who'd lived there for 17 years moved to Texas.\n\nAnd my older brother was gonna move in, but then he moved to Brazil. So I got to move in. And one of my college friends was my roommate, so we split the rent. And I stayed there for 20 years, 28 years.\n\nALTSCHUL: Both of your parents were psychiatrists. Do you think that had an influence on your ability to bring so much understanding and depth and character analysis?\n\nLONERGAN: I'm sure it did. I mean, who knows?\n\nALTSCHUL: Did you ever think you would be interested in being an analyst or a psychologist? And how the brain works and how people make the choices they make?\n\nLONERGAN: No. Although I think it's something I would be good at and that I would like and be interested in. It seems very interesting. But I don't know if I really have the temperament for it.\n\nMy stepfather, who's still practicing, you hear him talk about his work and it's fascinating. He loves it. He's very interested in people. He's very undogmatic. He's very smart. And it just sounds like a fascinating thing to do all day long.\n\nALTSCHUL: They're psychotherapists or psychiatrists?\n\nLONERGAN: They're psychoanalysts. They're Freudian psychoanalysts. Right down the line!\n\nALTSCHUL: Five days a week?\n\nLONERGAN: I don't know that, nobody does that anymore. But yeah, I don't think he has any full-time analytic patients anymore.\n\nALTSCHUL: What about the process of writing? Who kinda guided you there?\n\nLONERGAN: Well, you know, a bunch of people. The main person who helped me was Matthew Broderick's mother, Patsy Broderick. She was a really good friend, so I always feel funny calling her a teacher or a mentor, but she that also. She was just the smartest person I've ever met.\n\nALTSCHUL: Really the smartest person you've ever known?\n\nLONERGAN: I'd say so. Yeah. As far as I'm aware. I may have met other smarter people but not spoken to them. No, she was really brilliant. She had this incredible insight. She just was very thoughtful and also very, very insightful.\n\nALTSCHUL: I love that she kind of got to the heart of what some of your works were about, before you knew.\n\nLONERGAN: Oh yeah. She'd always know what you were doing. And she'd know when you weren't quite doing it the way it wanted to be done. And she just had a very profound understanding of \u2013 I hate to call it this \u2013 how the creative process works. And she also had a profound understanding of how elusive it can be. I showed her every single thing I wrote that I cared about, from the time I was in 10th or 11th grade to, I was about, well, 40 years old. And she died, so that was the end of that. But I didn't really feel like I had finished, I didn't feel safe with the material till she'd said it was okay.\n\nALTSCHUL: Really?\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah. It wasn't, like, I always agreed with her. And I got to know her tastes a little bit, and I got to understand where they diverged from mine. And she was also very, very honest and blunt, without being mean, but it was very valuable, 'cause most people, you beg your friends to be truthful with you, and they tend to soft-pedal their criticisms a bit anyway, unless they're just smart asses who like to criticize you, in which case you don't need their help. (LAUGHTER) But it's nice to have someone who's supportive, but very, very truthful with you.\n\nALTSCHUL: You're so well known for your natural dialogue between characters, it almost feels as though we're eavesdropping on a conversation. Where did you hone that? This natural, relaxed dialogue between characters?\n\nLONERGAN: Well, I try to recreate actual human speech as best I can. And I mean, I have a good ear for dialogue, obviously, and I have a good desultory memory for some things. I miss huge swaths of experience, but (LAUGHS) of little pieces that I remember, I remember pretty well. I've always liked dialogue. I've always been interested in the way people talk. I wrote a science fiction novel when I was 11 and 12, or 12 and 13, something like that. It was called \"The Wonderful World of Pluto.\" (LAUGHS)\n\nALTSCHUL: Oh my gosh. Your parents had their hands full.\n\nLONERGAN: No, no! I was just sitting there typing. I don't think it was too much to cope, I was. But anyway, my father read something that I had written and he said, \"Your dialogue is very good.\" And I was so pleased that he had liked anything that I had done, that I then thought, \"Oh, I'm very good at dialogue.\" And I don't know if I was or not, but I think that one compliment directed me, fueled me a bit and encouraged me. Who knows? I mean, nobody knows why anybody's good at anything.\n\nALTSCHUL: And it gives you confidence. You know? You do something, and somebody acknowledges a job well done, it gives you that extra little something.\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah, or even if they say you're good at something you're not good at, you think, \"Oh, well maybe \u2026\" It might encourage you to go in that direction a bit more.\n\nALTSCHUL: So, speaking of things that stood the test of time, how does \"The Wonderful World of Pluto\" hold up now?\n\nLONERGAN: Not too well! The pictures are good. (LAUGHTER)\n\nALTSCHUL: So, \"Waverly Gallery,\" \"This Is Our Youth,\" pieces of yours that just stand the test of time. Years go by, you watch them again, they feel fresh, relevant. What is it? Is it that dialogue that makes a piece feel timeless?\n\nCBS News\n\nLONERGAN: Who knows? The only thing I can say, I consciously try to avoid being topical.\n\nALTSCHUL: Issues of the day are not on your plate \u2013\n\nLONERGAN: Not really. There's nothing wrong with them, and if they have some depth to them, you know, you read plays that are topical that are 30, 40, 50 years old and they're wonderful because they have something besides topicality to them.\n\nBut I don't know whether this is grandiosity or what, or just a desire for the material to stay alive, but I try not to worry about that too much. And it's hard, it's not really for me to say. I hope the plays are good and good enough to live beyond the first couple years when they appeared.\n\nALTSCHUL: You know, \"This Is Our Youth,\" it's a play, it's young people, and it's just talking. They're just all talking. Lots of talking. One might think, \"Oh, well, that's, you know, kind of a simple play. They're talking.\" But that's actually the most complicated thing to do, is to have people simply talking.\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah. Most plays are just talking!\n\nALTSCHUL: Yes, yes. (LAUGHTER)\n\nLONERGAN: You know, you can turn the lights on and off, (LAUGHTER) if someone walks in or out. But yeah, because I'm trying to make it resemble real life as much as I can, I think some of the \u2013 people have said, \"Well, nothing happens in that play, but the dialogue's very good.\" But I think if all that happened to you in two days, you'd think you'd had quite an eventful weekend. So I actually think a lot happens to those characters. And there's not exactly a plot in \"Waverly Gallery,\" but there's this progression. There's a plot of some kind. There's a structure to it, or you couldn't write it. And I don't know that I feel peeved or pleased when sometimes people say, \"There's no stories in my plays,\" 'cause I try very hard to give \u2013 you can't function without a structure. You can't just throw stuff down and have it be interesting.\n\nALTSCHUL: Right.\n\nLONERGAN: You might be interested for five or ten minutes, but then the bottom drops out and you're just like, \"What's gonna happen next? And I don't care.\"\n\nALTSCHUL: Right. So when people say there's no story, there are no plot line, it's no beginning, middle and end. No, they mean something else?\n\nLONERGAN: I don't know what they mean exactly, because you know, I often find when I'm watching something, it's when they bring in the sensational event that I start to lose interest. Unless it's a sensationalist story, in which case it's great. You know, can be really good. Like a spy novel. But even those depend somewhat on their verisimilitude to be compelling. And I mostly have verisimilitude as an anchor. But with no story, it's not interesting.\n\n\"You Can Count On Me\"\n\nALTSCHUL: Let's talk about \"You Can Count On Me\" and how that story developed.\n\nLONERGAN: It was a Naked Angels theatre company one act. This is different from how I usually work, but we would do one act plays, evenings of short pieces, which would be on a single theme, but very, very broad strokes. Like, one would be censorship and the other would be faith and the other would be women. I mean that's a pretty broad \u2013 half the human race is a very broad topic! (LAUGHTER) So you can kind of write whatever you want.\n\nSo there was an evening about faith, whatever it meant to you. And I have no religious faith at all, but I'm curious about people who do. And I'm interested in people who don't think the way I do.\n\nSo, I had this idea about a brother and a sister, just started to think what it means to me. And I thought of faith in other people, faith in other people, and the idea of putting your faith in someone who may not necessarily have earned it. And then the fact when people put their faith in you, sometimes you try to live up to it. Even if initially they were making a mistake.\n\nALTSCHUL: Right.\n\nLONERGAN: And that somehow got around to this brother and sister, one of whom was a religious person and the other of whom wasn't. One of 'em had kind of a restricted existence. The other is all over the place. Has a lot of freedom, but no foundation. And then I thought, \"Well, this is great. I like these two characters. I love this little scene.\" And then I was unable to write it for eight months. I don't know why.\n\nALTSCHUL: So it just had to sit there. A little seed in your brain somewhere, and you just let go. Let it sit back there. And then what happens? What changes where you feel like, \"Oh, I've got something \u2013 \"?\n\nLONERGAN: I have no idea. No idea. It percolates somehow. I sometimes wonder about that, 'cause there's often a delay between when you have an idea and you're able to write it.\n\nALTSCHUL: And you take that idea that was just a little nugget of a brother-sister, different worlds, different perspectives on meaning. And it changes into something bigger now.\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah, so I wrote the scene. It was about 12 pages long. And I really liked it. We performed it. The two actors were just great. And it seemed to me, I really liked the characters. I thought maybe I would use them for something else someday.\n\nAnd I was watching a play, it had a little kid in it. My mind was kinda wandering. And I thought, \"Oh gee. What if the sister in the one act had a son, and the brother, who's a bit irresponsible, formed a relationship with him and then kind of let him down a lot?\" And I thought, \"Oh, that sounds like a really good story.\" To me, anyway.\n\nAnd I immediately thought of the whole film in a way in my head, when I was watching that play. And I knew I had a good arc for a full story. And then it's often hard to describe how these things come about. In that case I kind of knew what the main relationship was, what the ending would be, and what the structure of the events was going to be. And then it was a question of filling things in. Like I thought, \"Okay, so he'll let the kid down in various ways, three or four times.\" But I didn't know what those would be. And then other things start to happen. It's like doing a crossword puzzle. Like, you're stuck, stuck, stuck on one word, and then there's an adjacent word that you figure out and it gives you one letter to the word you don't have. And then it gives you that whole word, and the whole thing starts to come into place.\n\nParamount Classics\n\nALTSCHUL: Right. The structure builds from the inside-out.\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah.\n\nALTSCHUL: So then from writing novels, plays, screenplays, you decide, \"I'm gonna try directing.\" When does a young man decide, \"I'm going to try directing now. This feels like a good choice?\"\n\nLONERGAN: When he realizes that he's being more of a backseat driver as a playwright than he ought to be.\n\nALTSCHUL: Not enough control.\n\nLONERGAN: Well, or being too controlling without being in charge, because if you're gonna have a director, you have to let them direct.\n\nALTSCHUL: Yes.\n\nLONERGAN: And if you wanna do everything for them, you should direct it yourself (LAUGH) or shut up. (LAUGHTER) Or at least step back a little bit.\n\nALTSCHUL: How did you learn that?\n\nLONERGAN: Well, I just [had] one small theatre experience after another. And then I also noticed, not to be immodest, that I often had an idea about how the scene could be played out. I think I'm more oriented towards actors than some of the directors that I had worked with were. And I found that I was able to communicate with the actors, I thought, better than some of the directors that I'd worked with.\n\nALTSCHUL: So you're an actor's director?\n\nLONERGAN: I am, I guess, because I was oriented that way from a very young age. Matthew's mom was an acting coach, and one of the things she would help me with when I was writing plays was to say, \"Listen, no one can act this. This is descriptive. This would go nicely in a book, but no one would say this and no one can act it.\" For whatever reason that passage wasn't actable. And she was very much towards what was towards the behavior, and not so much the words.\n\nBut I also worked with some wonderful directors. But even if they were wonderful, I could feel myself kind of getting in their hair, more than was appropriate. And I thought, the other thing is that I still don't feel the need to direct theatre all the time. I have two plays that I directed 'cause I had a real specific idea of how I wanted them to be, the whole design. But my other play, \"The Waverly Gallery,\" had this great director, Lila Neugebauer. And I'm able to participate without taking over. And it works fine. For a movie, if you're not gonna direct it you might as well say goodbye to the material forever, if you're the writer.\n\nALTSCHUL: Do you feel that way about screenplays now? If you're not directing it, you just say goodbye to whatever vision you had?\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah. That's just--\n\nALTSCHUL: And just walk in the other direction--\n\nLONERGAN: But that's the system. I mean there's two parts. One part is that that's the convention for screenplays in this country. The other is that when you do direct you can kinda see why you might not want the writer hanging around, because there's so much you have to do that is not to do with the script. That you have to have some flexibility with what you do with the script. On the other hand, if the convention was to be more respectful of the screenplay, everyone would work around that just fine.\n\n\"Manchester by the Sea\"\n\nALTSCHUL: Can you talk about \"Manchester by the Sea\"?\n\nLONERGAN: That was unusual, 'cause that was an assignment at first, that became my own project. Because Matt Damon and John Krazinski came to me with the idea for the story.\n\nALTSCHUL: So they come with a story idea, and say, \"Here are the characters. We're kinda thinking this is the story.\" They don't come with material presented. They say \"We really want you to write this\"?\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah, they had an idea for a movie that they liked. And then they liked my writing, so they wanted me to write it. And Matt was gonna direct it and he was also gonna be in it. And then eventually he wasn't. When he read the script he suggested that I direct it. And then as it turned out, he wasn't able to be in it either because of his schedule. 'Cause he's always working. They had, like six projects backed up and there was a teeny window which closed. So that's how that came about. And it was unusual because it wasn't an assignment and I didn't generate the material, but very quickly everything in the film became, it did generate after a short time, 'cause I wasn't able to write the script any other way.\n\nRoadside Attractions/Amazon Studios\n\nALTSCHUL: And you cast Casey.\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah. And we ended up casting Casey. We went right to Casey after Matt became unavailable.\n\nALTSCHUL: Actually, great choice.\n\nLONERGAN: He is amazing.\n\nALTSCHUL: Just getting those kinds of performances out of actors, it only happens when you've got somebody who is an actor's director who understands what it's like on both sides.\n\nLONERGAN: Well, they bring so much to it. And without that, you don't really have much of anything. I mean, there are some directors, great directors, who aren't particularly oriented towards the acting. And they kind of let the actors do what they're gonna do. And if you get good actors, that's great.\n\nALTSCHUL: But when you do it, you're allowing actors to take the chances and the risks.\n\nLONERGAN: Oh, you have to. Well, I mean most of it's casting. If you cast the right person, and the more you direct, the more you learn that it's casting. Well, I knew that from the beginning, but the more you learn to get out of their way and shut up. (LAUGHS) 'Cause they don't really need you telling them everything all the time. They come in quite a lot, and they have a big job to do. And if they're anywhere near www you want them to do, it's really a good idea not to say too much. And it's really hard to learn that, because you're, like, full of ideas of your own.\n\nALTSCHUL: Right. So does that come with time? Wisdom? Mistakes?\n\nLONERGAN: Mistakes. Like, you notice that after you talk they get worse. (LAUGHS) So then it's very simple to understand that you shouldn't talk!\n\nALTSCHUL: So \"Manchester by the Sea\" was profoundly sad, disturbing, moving, emotional, let's just say very, very sad.\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah.\n\nALTSCHUL: But the film didn't scare people away. I mean, that kind of topic and the sadness, the grief, the loss. That could have just been something people just retreated from, but it didn't. What was it that resonated with people in that? Why were the audiences drawn to that film?\n\nLONERGAN: Well, it's always hard to say, but I think it's not a punishing movie. It's not a movie that's tryin' to beat you over the head. It's not tryin' to make you miserable and it's not tryin' to shove your face into misery. It tries to be a human story about people going through something very difficult and doing their best. And that's something interesting, there's a natural dramatic content in there.\n\nALTSCHUL: Right.\n\nLONERGAN: And it makes it a story and not just a dirge. If it was dirge it would be terrible. And not something false about it. I feel like there's a falseness to the shrill nature of some comedies. And there's an opposite falseness on the other end of the scale to when things are just too heavy, too miserable, too relentless, too bleak. Even though life can often be extremely difficult, there's always other things happening, so there's a feeling there's a false manipulative feeling to me when you forget to mention that the person at the other table is having a great time while you're being broken up with by your girlfriend or worse.\n\nWe're not all having the same experience all the time. Or you know, it doesn't rain when you're in a bad mood. You're in a terrible mood, you go outside and it's a beautiful day. Or you're in a great mood and it's a rainy day. And I think keeping all those balls in the air keeps it from being a depressing experience.\n\n\"Analyze This\"\n\nALTSCHUL: So let's go back a little bit in time, kinda early on. You had early success in the film business. \"Analyze This.\" You know, how did that come about?\n\nWarner Brothers\n\nLONERGAN: \"Analyze This\" was an original script that I wrote. I never wanted to be a screenwriter or a director, or I didn't at first. I wanted to be a playwright, but you can't make any money as a playwright unless you're a very big deal.\n\nAnd I had friends who were making good money writing screenplays, and they kept urging me to do the same. And my stepfather gave me the idea for \"Analyze This,\" 'cause it was based on a real anecdote where a famous Mafioso went to one of his colleagues \u2013 the only Sicilian psychoanalyst in New York at the time, (LAUGHS) who had been approached by a famous mobster who wanted to talk to him. And he saw him once and said, \"Just don't tell me anything. I don't wanna know anything about you or your life or anything.\" 'Cause he didn't wanna get involved.\n\nALTSCHUL: No. (LAUGHS)\n\nLONERGAN: I thought it would be funny if he took him on and all sorts of terrible things happened afterwards! (LAUGHTER) It was a bit too high concept for me. But the idea was to write a script and sell it, and let them do to it whatever they were gonna do to it, but make some money. Which is how it turned out. And then they ended up making the film a few years later.\n\nALTSCHUL: What was your experience with that process?\n\nLONERGAN: I sold the script. I got a lotta money for it. I did two rewrites, studio rewrites, which were terrible. (LAUGHS) Terrible ideas, terribly executed by me. And then they bought the script outright, which is unusual.\n\nALTSCHUL: So the two rewrites were scrapped and \u2013\n\nALTSCHUL: You go to the original. So I lived off of that script. My overhead was very low. I lived off that one script for three years. And I was able to write plays and do what I wanted for three years. And it gave me an entry into the screenwriting world, and I rewrote other people's scripts.\n\n\"Gangs of New York\"\n\nALTSCHUL: So Martin Scorsese says to you, \"I need your help. Could you maybe add some depth to the characters.\" What does that mean, add some depth to the characters and the script?\n\nLONERGAN: Oh, it just means make them better.\n\nALTSCHUL: So you take the script and there are specific characters that he gives you an assignment? Or this six characters? Or two? And I want you to really bring them to life more. Make them more approachable?\n\nMiramax\n\nLONERGAN: You know, they were having structural problems with the script. Mostly they were having problems with Leonardo DiCaprio's character. They tried a bunch of different ideas for him. Tried him being a cold blooded killer. And so they basically come to you with their problems, and then also say, \"And if you have other problems with the script, you know, let us know what you think, and maybe we should address those, too.\"\n\nALTSCHUL: So it's a draft?\n\nLONERGAN: They're very far along in that process. I was asked to come on two weeks before they were supposed to start shooting.\n\nALTSCHUL: Holy \u2013 wow!\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah. So they actually delayed shooting for a couple of weeks because they needed to work on the script. I read the script. It was pretty clear where it was working and where it wasn't. Most of the stuff with Daniel Day-Lewis' character was really good, so I barely touched that. Leo's character was sort of all over the place.\n\nAnd so you just kinda get in there and you just try to \u2013 same as with your own work, you try to think of a person who feels vivid to you. You try to put that person into scenes. A lotta the dialogue I thought needed work, so I tried to make the dialogue scenes better. I tried to beef up Cameron Diaz's character as much as I could. You never know what to do until you're faced with a problem, then it's quite obvious what you wanna try to do, anyway. And it was really exciting.\n\nALTSCHUL: Do you love being given a problem?\n\nLONERGAN: Yes.\n\nALTSCHUL: Do you like to fix stuff?\n\nLONERGAN: I do, yeah. And I do like that. It can be really fun. And it's nice to come in and save the day. That movie was so late in the process that every other movie I've ever script doctored, they always rewrite you after you're done anyway. It's more like an exercise than a real creative endeavor. But you're not there to express yourself. You're there to help them out. So it's easy to walk away from.\n\nALTSCHUL: Triage.\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah, and it's not your movie. You're there to consult and help. And it can be really fun to try to do that.\n\n\"Margaret\"\n\nALTSCHUL: So \"Margaret\" is perhaps your least-seen movie, but also considered your master work.\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah, I think it's the best one I've done of the three [I directed]. I like all three of them, but I think that's the most interesting.\n\nALTSCHUL: Was that story drawn from something in your life? Do you know those characters?\n\nLONERGAN: Just a little, well, a lot of the material. It also takes place on the Upper West Side, where I grew up. The high school that the girl goes to is based on my high school very closely.\n\nALTSCHUL: Walden?\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah. Very closely. And a lotta those conversations in the classroom were taken strictly out of our [classes]. Yeah, smart (LAUGH) and smart-alecky [kids]! Everything you write is culled from your own experience or the experience of people you meet or see in other films or plays, and it's translated. Just a lot of borrowing and drawing on from all sorts of places.\n\nALTSCHUL: And at its core, what is it about?\n\nLONERGAN: That's a little hard to say. If I could say in a sentence, I wouldn't be taking up three hours of anyone's time. (LAUGHS)\n\nFox Searchlight\n\nALTSCHUL: Well, there was a lot of beautiful things in that film to look at.\n\nLONERGAN: It's a little hard to say what it's about. It's about a teenage girl who's facing what the real world is like for the first time. And it's a very big world. And everyone else in it is just as interested in their life as she is in her own.\n\nALTSCHUL: Yes.\n\nLONERGAN: And that's probably why it's so hard to get anything done. (CHUCKLES) Or get anything right in life, 'cause everyone else is pursuing their own agenda, with perfect reason. Why shouldn't they?\n\nALTSCHUL: I mean that's what it is about, right? It's just about coming to terms as a young person realizing that everybody's really doing their own thing. And you may feel like you're at the center of something important, and that is true, in your own world.\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah. So is everybody else.\n\nALTSCHUL: But in the grand scheme of things it's hard to wake up. Yeah.\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah, it is hard. And especially as you're becoming an adult, and becoming not just a function of your family and your parents, to be facing the complexity of the rest of the world, and the fact that other people are just as important as you are at that moment when your own ego is identifying itself, is a very tricky moment in life. And it's something that some people never come to terms with.\n\nALTSCHUL: Why was that film a hard film to make in the end? Why were there so many troubles, if you read about it or you read some of the, you know, the lawsuit. What happened? Where did it go wrong?\n\nLONERGAN: It's a long story. The short version is that they didn't trust me to take care of the film after it was shot, in the editing, and I didn't have the smarts to put them at ease. And it just escalated. And none of us would budge. And it just went on and on and on.\n\nALTSCHUL: So if you were to do something differently, you might have said, \"Okay, guys.\" You mighta walked them through it a little more?\n\nLONERGAN: I woulda walked them through it more. I would have had more respect for their anxieties, even though I don't think I could have had more respect for their opinions about the film, 'cause they weren't very interesting or original or anything. But on the other hand, that's not what they're there for. That's what I'm there for.\n\nThey're there to support and pay for the film, and they're very anxious about how it's gonna turn out. And I think I just \u2013 I would be a little more \u2013 I would spend more time assuaging them and less time tryin' to convince them to get off my back.\n\nALTSCHUL: And that's just life experience, right?\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah, yeah.\n\nALTSCHUL: Chalk it up to \u2013\n\nLONERGAN: Unfortunately. I wish I had had that realization before I went into it. But it worked out in the end.\n\nALTSCHUL: Well, it worked out in the end in that if one wants to see your version of the film, you're a click away.\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah. Just watch the extended \"Margaret,\" the extended edition.\n\nALTSCHUL: And that was what you wanted to make.\n\nLONERGAN: More or less. It was a long way getting to the film that I wanted to make in the editing, so by the time I got there I wasn't able to completely execute everything I wanted to. But it's closer. So there's a theatrical version and the extended edition. And I really don't care for the theatrical version in retrospect, and the extended edition is more representative of the film I wanted to make.\n\nALTSCHUL: Earlier you said first and foremost, you are a playwright. That is what you want to do most of all.\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah.\n\nALTSCHUL: Still?\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah. Well, now that I've directed these three films, I really do think of myself as a director, as a filmmaker also. I think that's come up to occupy equal space in my mind.\n\nALTSCHUL: It does?\n\nLONERGAN: Yeah. I like it. It's not like having a real job, but it's very difficult and absorbing and interesting. And as much so as being a playwright, I'd say. I'd say it's much more work in a funny way, 'cause as a playwright you can do the writing and pass it on to others, and hang around nervously to see if it turns out the way you wanted it to.\n\nALTSCHUL: Right.\n\nLONERGAN: Director really has to, you can't do anything else for at least a year. It's quite a full-time job all the time.\n\nALTSCHUL: Are you working on any plays, films?\n\nLONERGAN: I'm trying to work, yes. (LAUGHTER) I have a play I wanna write. I have a film I'm trying to write. And I'm supposed to write a television show, too, but I don't know what that's gonna be.\n\n\n\nFor more info:", "Amazon is taking a page from the Home Shopping Network and its owner, QVC as retailers turn the entire month of November into an non-stop barrage of Black Fridays.

When 23-year-old Helen Hargan and her mother, 63-year-old Pamela Hargan, were found dead in a McLean home in July 2017, police initially reported the deaths as a murder-suicide.\n\nBut at a press conference Friday, Fairfax County Police said detectives quickly realized the crime scene had been staged. Megan Hargan was arrested Friday morning in Monongalia County, West Virginia.\n\nWUSA-TV\n\nFairfax County Police Maj.

It was like it all blew up in your face,\" North said.\n\nShe said she believes the motive was money and jealousy. North said Pamela had bought the younger daughter Helen a house that she was about to move into, before they were killed.\n\nPolice say this case remains active and there could be more charges. It was unclear Friday if Megan Hargan had an attorney.", "In June 2015, a pair of convicted killers vanished from their cells inside a maximum security prison in upstate New York. It seemed only a matter of time before their brazen escape, and the 23-day manhunt that followed, got its Hollywood close-up. What might surprise you is just who's behind that close-up.\n\n\"I was out of the country shooting 'Zoolander 2' when it happened, so I wasn't as familiar with it,\" said Ben Stiller, one of the funniest actors on the planet, the star of three separate billion-dollar comedy franchises (\"Night at the Museum,\" \"Madagascar,\" and \"Meet the Parents\") \u2013 not to mention favorites like \"There's Something About Mary,\" \"Tropic Thunder,\" and those \"Zoolander\" movies.\n\n\"So, this is what's confusing: It's sort of like, 'There was a big prison break. We should make this into a great drama. Let's get the 'Zoolander' guy to take a look at it!'\" said correspondent Tony Dokoupil.\n\nCBS News\n\n\"Yeah, some people might think that this could actually be funnier than 'Zoolander 2'!\" Stiller laughed. \"I don't blame them for that. Because I would probably think that, too, if I didn't know anything about what I was doing and they said, 'Oh, Ben Stiller's gonna do this?' 'cause they don't know what's going on in my head.\"\n\nAs it turns out, nothing was more serious than directing a real-life drama.\n\nThe result is \"Escape at Dannemora,\" a seven-part miniseries, debuting next Sunday on Showtime (a division of CBS). It stars Benicio Del Toro as Richard Matt, serving 25 years-to-life for the kidnap-murder of his former employer; and Paul Dano as David Sweat, also sentenced to life for murdering a sheriff's deputy.\n\nTo watch a trailer for \"Escape at Dannemora\" click on the video player below:\n\nDokoupil asked, \"How do you even get a hacksaw blade into prison?\"\n\n\"Well, that's why you sleep with the woman who runs the tailor shop!\" Stiller replied.\n\nThe key to their escape was help from a prison employee with a romantic appetite: Joyce Mitchell, played by Patricia Arquette. \"I think she's bored and she's looking to feel something,\" she said.\n\n\"What does Ben do to help you bring out this character?\" Dokoupil asked.\n\n\"I wasn't sure how he was going to be as a director. But he's really generous with actors and gives you a lot of support and listens to your ideas, and really lets you try them out in a really authentic way.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough Stiller, at 52, has directed in the past, this marks the first time he's taken on directing exclusively. Asked how he felt about taking on the job, Stiller said, \"It was a personal revelation, directing and not acting. 'Cause you know, who wants to direct me, right? I don't!\"\n\nStiller says it was the nitty-gritty details of the story that hooked him, so much so that while filming on location last February, he made sure we saw the actual manhole cover where the two escapees emerged to freedom. \"I just kept coming back to the facts. Like, what really happened? And if there were something that seemed kind of almost unbelievable but it was true, that was something I wanted to try to include so that people would have that reaction, and go: Come on, that can't be true!\"\n\nCBS News\n\nBut Stiller couldn't get permission to film inside the prison, so he and the team built a full-scale replica of the cell block where Sweat and Matt hatched their plan.\n\nFirst, they pounded through a wall. They then cut their way into a steel pipe, and shimmied 15 feet to cut a second hole, to freedom.\n\nStiller shimmied through the pipe as well. \"Yeah, I mean, as a director, I felt like I had to!\"\n\nPerhaps that's because the son of comedy greats Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara didn't always dream of following the family into performing. \"In my mind I was always thinking, I want to be a director. I want to be a director.\"\n\nParamount Pictures\n\n\"So the whole got-a-Super-8-camera-at-age-8-or-9, that's true?\" Dokoupil asked.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah. I mean, that was the only option back then!\" he laughed. \"Lots of fake blood. I remember making my sister throw up yogurt once in the elevator.\"\n\nBut after directing the 1996 movie \"The Cable Guy,\" Hollywood executives had a message for Ben Stiller, the director: \"The message being that, like, the phone not ringing!\" Stiller laughed. \"That being, there is no message. Checking your messages and there is no message. Yeah, 'Cable Guy' was not a hit!\"\n\nIn fact, the opening of the New York Times review of \"Cable Guy,\" which starred Jim Carrey as a devious cable technician, announced it as \"the true disaster movie of the summer.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I remember reading that [opening paragraph]. I don't know if I read the rest of it!\" Stiller laughed.\n\n\"I wouldn't have,\" Dokoupil offered.\n\nTwo years later, \"There's Something About Mary\" was a surprise hit, beginning actor Ben Stiller's career as a master of gross-out humor, humiliation and pain.\n\n\"Are there gags that you've looked at in the script and been like, 'I'm sorry. I'm just not doin' that'?\" Dokoupil asked.\n\n\"Sure, yeah. Those are the ones you didn't see.\"\n\nStill, broad comedy has always co-existed with the more serious roles Stiller says he's proud of, but he now admits humor may have to take a backseat. \"I'm not really that interested in doing that kind of stuff,\" he said. \"That's just where I'm at in my life now.\"\n\n\"Are we seeing a kind of semi-retirement from comedy?\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" he laughed.\n\n\"Full-on retirement?\"\n\n\"It always goes well for actors, when they announce their retirement, doesn't it?\"\n\nEven so, \"Escape at Dannemora\" does sound more and more like an escape for Ben Stiller, too. \"That would be a great escape!\" he laughed. \"I would love it.\"\n\n\"You'd be happy with that?\"\n\n\"Yeah, for sure. I love directing. I would be very happy to do this as long as I can do it, for sure.\"\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\"Escape at Dannemora\" (Showtime), begins November 18\n\n\n\nStory produced by Jay Kernis.", "Jimmy Butler has his wish: He's out of Minnesota. And just like that, Philadelphia has a new Big Three - one that could make serious noise in the Eastern Conference.\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation said Saturday that Butler is being traded to the 76ers in a package that will send Dario Saric and Robert Covington to the Timberwolves. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the trade had not yet been announced by either team and was still pending NBA approval, which is not expected until Monday.\n\nJustin Patton will also be sent to Philadelphia, and Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick are also going to Minnesota, the person said.\n\nESPN, citing league sources, also reported the deal.\n\nMinnesota has agreed to a deal to send Jimmy Butler to Philadelphia for a package that includes Robert Covington and Dario Saric, league sources tell @ZachLowe_NBA and me. \u2014 Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) November 10, 2018\n\nThe Athletic first reported the agreement.\n\nPhiladelphia's \"Process\" led it to the second round of the playoffs last season behind two of the game's youngest, brightest stars in big man Joel Embiid and point guard Ben Simmons. Butler, an elite wing and outstanding defender, will join them in a quest to rule the Eastern Conference now that LeBron James has left that league to join the Los Angeles Lakers following eight straight trips to the NBA Finals with Miami and Cleveland.\n\nThe first order of business will be making the trade official, something that could come in time to get Butler in uniform for a game at Miami on Monday. The next step for Philadelphia will be coming to an agreement on an extension for Butler, a pending free agent who made clear to Minnesota that he would not be re-signing there in 2019.\n\nTranslated: The Wolves had to trade him, or they would lose him for nothing over the summer.\n\nThere has been Butler drama every step of the way this season.\n\nESPN reported that at his first practice with Minnesota this fall, Butler verbally challenged players, coaches and general manager Scott Layden while dominating in scrimmages, even when going up against stars like Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins.\n\nButler said the report was true.\n\n\"All my emotion came out at one time,\" Butler told ESPN later that day. \"Was it the right way to do it? No. But I can't control that when I'm out there competing. That's my love of the game. That's raw me. Me at my finest, me at my purest. That's what you're going to get inside the lines.\"\n\nButler continued to be miserable in Minnesota, and the Timberwolves have gotten off to a lousy start waiting for this inevitable move. Minnesota finished a 0-5 road trip with a loss in Sacramento on Friday night and is 4-9 overall - winless in eight games on the road.\n\nButler played in 10 of those games, averaging 21.3 points. It was a peculiar arrangement; the Timberwolves were still running things through him often, even while the worst-kept secret in the NBA was that he wanted a change of address. Plenty of teams were mentioned along the way - Houston, the Los Angeles Clippers, Miami among them - as top candidates.\n\nButler, who turned 29 on Sept. 14, has been an All-Star in each of the last four seasons. There are also concerns, though they clearly didn't put off Philadelphia. Butler has missed at least 15 games in four of the last five seasons, including a career-high 23 games last year while dealing with a knee injury.\n\nPhiladelphia will become Butler's third team, after Chicago and Minnesota. He's a career 16.5 point-per-game scorer, though that is skewed by his first two seasons that were very meager on the scoring front. He's on pace this season to average at least 20 points for the fifth consecutive year.\n\n\"Welcome to the best sports city in America,\" quarterback Carson Wentz of the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles tweeted to Butler.\n\nSaric is in his third season and averaging 11.1 points, shooting only 36 percent. Covington had been a starter for Philadelphia for the bulk of the last four-plus seasons and is averaging 11.3 points per game this year.\n\nPhiladelphia and Minnesota don't meet until Jan. 15. Butler's return trip to Minnesota this season would be March 30, when he's sure to be showered with boos from a Target Center crowd that jeered him at the beginning of the home opener before quickly letting up. Butler had 33 points on 10-for-12 shooting from the floor in 36 minutes that night against Cleveland, a reminder amid the drama why coach Tom Thibodeau was so eager to acquire him the year before.\n\nThibodeau swung a draft-night deal with Chicago that sent Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn and a first-round pick that became Lauri Markkanen to the Bulls for Butler and a later first-rounder Minnesota used on Patton. In the wake of that move, long-frustrated Wolves fans figured they were finally on their way to contending in the Western Conference for the first time since the Kevin Garnett era ended.\n\nPaired with Towns and Wiggins, the first overall picks in the 2015 and 2014 drafts, respectively, Butler immediately provided the experience, tenacity and defense the Wolves were missing, in addition to his scoring touch. He loved playing for Thibodeau, his coach for his first five seasons with the Bulls, and they helped Minnesota get to the playoffs last spring for the first time in 14 years.\n\nBut the roster never truly meshed. Butler used his brash, blunt personality to challenge Towns and Wiggins to become more consistent defenders.\n\nAnd now, a new start awaits them all.", "", "The Florida secretary of state is ordering recounts in the U.S. Senate and governor races, an unprecedented review of two major races in the state that took five weeks to decide the 2000 presidential election.\n\nSecretary Ken Detzner issued the order on Saturday after the unofficial results in both races fell within the margin that by law triggers a recount.\n\nThe unofficial results show that Republican former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis led Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by less than 0.5 percentage points, triggering a required machine recount of ballots.\n\nGillum told reporters Saturday that he's not conceding yet, although he had said he was conceding on Tuesday night.\n\n\"I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call that we count every single vote,\" Gillum said. \"We count every vote and I say this recognizing that my fate in this may or may not change. What I do know is that every single Floridian who took time to go out, to cast their vote, to participate in this process deserve the comfort of knowing that in a democratic society and in this process, every vote will be counted.\"\n\nHe went on to say he's prepared to accept any outcome of the election as long as every vote is counted.\n\nDeSantis thanked the elections workers and ignored the recount now underway. \"With the election behind us, it's now time to come together as a state as we prepare to serve all Floridians,\" he said in a video statement. \"Since Tuesday night, that is what I have been doing, that is what I have been doing, and that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead, as I prepare to take office as the 46th governor of the state of Florida.\"\n\nIn the Senate race, Republican Gov. Rick Scott's lead over Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson is less than 0.25 percentage points. This race, too, will be starting a machine recount. If, after that's finished, there remains margin of .25 perceent, election officials will begin a required hand recount of ballots from tabulation machines that couldn't determine which candidate got the vote.\n\nScott's campaign declared that he had already won the election, argued that the margin of 12,562 votes was insurmountable and urged Nelson to decline the recount.\n\n\"It's time for Senator Nelson to accept reality and spare the state of Florida the time, expense and discord of a recount,\" Scott campaign spokesman Chris Hartline said in a statement.\n\nNelson declined to end his bid and released a statement saying, \"We have every expectation the recount will be full and fair and will continue taking action to ensure every vote is counted without interference or efforts to undermine the democratic process. We believe when every legal ballot is counted we'll win this election.\"\n\nThe ballot-counting issues are centered in Broward County and Palm Beach County, two populous counties that tend to vote Democratic. On Friday, Scott won two lawsuits -- one ordering the Palm Beach County elections supervisor to submit \"over-voted\" and \"under-voted\" absentee ballots to the Palm Beach County Canvassing Board for public review of each vote before they are counted. Over-votes are ballots in which the machines read that the voter may have selected more than one candidate, and under-votes occur when the machine does not register a vote on the ballot. The other lawsuit ordered the Broward County elections supervisor to release records of voter information.\n\nScott and President Trump have claimed without offering evidence that Democrats are tampering with the election. Mr. Trump wrote a tweet Saturday afternoon that seemed to allude to the recount, saying: \"Trying to STEAL two big elections in Florida! We are watching closely!\"\n\nJack Turman contributed to this report.\n\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this story suggested that the Bill Nelson - Rick Scott Senate race would undergo a mandatory hand recount. However, there must be a machine recount first, and if, after that process is finished, there remains a margin of under 0.25 percent separating the two candidates, there would be a hand recount, The story has been updated to reflect this.", "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Federal and airport authorities are investigating why an air traffic controller became incapacitated and went silent while working a night shift alone in the tower at busy McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. CBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave reports that in air traffic audio of the incident, the controller appeared to become incoherent and eventually unresponsive until she was discovered by another controller returning from a break.\n\n\"The FAA is very concerned about this incident and what occurred is not acceptable,\" an agency spokesperson told CBS News.\n\nThe controller can be heard slurring her words, confusing flight numbers and being otherwise incoherent before an alarming open mic incident where she can be heard coughing and choking.\n\nAir traffic recordings available on the internet show commercial airline pilots having trouble understanding the controller during radio communications about approaches to land, clearances to take off and directions for taxiing. Some begin talking between themselves about something being amiss.\n\nAt one point, a pilot on a flight waiting to depart asks, \"Is there somebody up there who knows what they are doing?\"\n\nLater in the incident, one of the flights radioed, \"I hate to ask this but do you have a supervisor?\"\n\nAnother pilot responded, \"Something's wrong.\"\n\n\"Somethings going on up there,\" another concerned pilot can be heard saying.\n\nOn Friday, the FAA changed its staffing rules to ensure two controllers in the tower before midnight.\n\n\"No safety events occurred during this incident,\" the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement about what officials said amounted to a 40-minute span during which the female controller apparently lost consciousness shortly before midnight Wednesday.\n\n\"An air traffic controller at the Las Vegas tower became incapacitated while on duty,\" the agency said. It did not identify the controller or the cause of her incapacitation.\n\nAirport director Rosemary Vassiliadis issued a statement saying initial findings echoed the FAA assessment.\n\nFive inbound aircraft remained airborne during the incident, and aircraft on the ground held positions or communicated between themselves to maintain safety while moving, the FAA said.\n\nAt one point, the controller sounds sleepy and apologizes over the radio, saying she is \"choking a little bit.\" Minutes later, she misstates an aircraft's call numbers. Finally, her microphone opens to the sound of coughing and grunting.\n\nShe does not respond to a pilot's inquiry before the sound of a male voice is heard in the room asking if the woman is all right.\n\nOfficials said a male controller who had been on break was summoned to return to the tower. Paramedics responded.\n\nThe FAA said the woman was put on administrative leave, and the agency ordered two controllers to be in the tower during busy hours.\n\nMcCarran is among the 10 busiest airports in the U.S. in passenger volume. The unidentified controller worked for a little more than an hour before trouble began and communicated with pilots of 29 aircraft before she was replaced, the FAA said.\n\nNational Air Traffic Controllers Association chief Paul Rinaldi issued a statement praising the work of thousands of union members around the country and promising cooperation in the FAA investigation \"so that all of the facts are known.\"", "HOUSTON -- The Houston Chronicle has retracted eight stories by a former political reporter after an independent investigation found they were based on sources whose existence couldn't be confirmed.

He did not respond to numerous phone messages, emails or attempts to reach him through former colleagues.\"\n\nJohn Bridges, managing editor for the Austin American-Statesman, told Wood that the paper had taken a limited look at Ward's work there, but would now go deeper.\n\n\"After the initial allegations, we conducted a preliminary review of Ward's final years of work for the Statesman and did not find conclusive evidence of the kind of pattern uncovered by the Chronicle's investigation,\" Bridges told Wood for his investigative report. \"But given the Chronicle's new findings and the seriousness of these allegations, we are enlisting outside journalists to conduct further investigation into work that appeared in the Statesman.\"\n\nDuring Ward's time at the Houston and Austin papers, The Associated Press has distributed to its members more than a dozen stories reported by him for use in their own publications.

Two officials say Ian David Long, a 28-year-old former Marine, apparently paused in the middle of his deadly rampage to post to Instagram.\n\nSocial media platforms have scrubbed that and any other posts following Wednesday night's massacre. But one law enforcement official said Long posted about his mental state and whether people would believe he was sane.\n\nAuthorities also were investigating whether he believed his former girlfriend would be at the Borderline Bar and Grill, said the official, who was briefed on the investigation but not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nA second law enforcement official, Ventura County Sheriff's Capt. Garo Kuredjian, said that - based on time stamps - the gunman apparently stopped shooting inside the bar and posted to Instagram. Kuredjian said he didn't know the content of any posts.\n\nInstagram and Facebook typically refuse to discuss individual accounts and did not respond to a request for comment. However, a spokesperson from Facebook told CBS News that the gunman did not post a story to Instagram.\n\nFurthermore, in a Facebook update attributed to Long by CNN, which said it was posted around the time of the shootings, he writes: \"I hope people call me insane (laughing emojis).. wouldn't that just be a big ball of irony? Yeah... I'm insane, but the only thing you people do after these shootings is 'hopes and prayers'.. or 'keep you in my thoughts'... every time... and wonder why these keep happening...\"\n\nAuthorities described an attack of military efficiency. None of those injured was hurt by gunfire. When the gunman shot his .45-caliber pistol, he killed. As scores of police officers closed in, Long apparently shot and killed himself.\n\nSeveral people who knew Long in the suburb of Thousand Oaks where the gunman went to high school and eventually moved back in with his mother described him in disturbing terms.\n\nLong made others feel uncomfortable going back to his teens.\n\nDominique Colell, who coached girls' track and field at the high school where Long was a sprinter, remembers an angry young man who could be verbally and physically combative.\n\nIn one instance, Colell said Long used his fingers to mimic shooting her in the back of the head as she talked to another athlete. In another, he grabbed her rear and midsection after she refused to return a cellphone he said was his.\n\n\"I literally feared for myself around him,\" Colell said in an interview Friday. \"He was the only athlete that I was scared of.\"\n\nColell said she wanted to kick Long off the team, but the boy's coach urged her to reconsider because that could compromise his goal of joining the Marines. She relented when, at the next track meet, Long apologized in front of several coaches and administrators.\n\nAttempts to get comment by phone and in person from officials at Newbury Park High School and its school district were unsuccessful. Both were closed because of a destructive wildfire in the area.\n\nAs investigators worked to figure out what set him off, President Donald Trump blamed mental illness, describing the gunman as \"a very sick puppy\" who had \"a lot of problems.\" At the White House on Friday, Trump touted his efforts to fund work on post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans and ignored questions about stricter gun control laws.\n\nInvestigators have not commented on whether mental illness played a role in the rampage. But a mental health specialist who assessed Long after sheriff's deputies responded to a call about his agitated behavior last spring worried he might be suffering from PTSD.\n\nThe incident happened in April, when yelling and loud banging noises coming from the home Long shared with his mother prompted a next-door neighbor to call authorities. The mental health specialist concluded there were no grounds to have him involuntarily committed.\n\nTodd Stratton was at the bar Wednesday night. He'd also been friends with Long for 11 years and said he thought he might be suffering from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when he came back from deployment in Afghanistan in 2013.\n\n\"There was times where people would ask him about it and he got kind of, you know, upset and said he didn't, you know, like talking about it,\" Stratton said.\n\nAmong the dead in the shooting rampage were a sheriff's sergeant gunned down as he entered the bar and a U.S. Navy veteran who survived last year's massacre in which a gunman in a high-rise Las Vegas hotel killed 58 people at an outdoor country music festival.", "In 40 years of making music, Elvis Costello has often collaborated across genres like with fellow Liverpudlian Paul McCartney, Burt Bacharach, and Questlove and the Roots. He continues that tradition of collaboration with his new album, \"Look Now,\" which Rolling Stone said \"finds him squaring his restless artistic impulses with his storied past.\"\n\nHe's back on tour after taking a sudden break last summer, canceling dates after surgery to remove a \"small, but very aggressive cancerous malignancy.\" But things got complicated last year when the British tabloids blew it up into a life-threatening cancer scare.\n\n\"I was answering letters for three weeks, you know, 'No, I am not dying.' You know, but it's not to make a joke of it,\" he said. \"Because you don't have to walk very far to find somebody who you love who's genuinely having a fight.\"\n\nOn his first new album in five years, Costello teams up with Burt Bacharach, who he's written with for 20 years, and his band The Imposters.\n\n\"Sometimes I lead the way, sometimes he leads the way. Sometimes the music is entirely his. In the case of the song, 'Stripping Paper,' which was intended for this show, I wrote all the music and sent it to him, said 'Burt, do you want to try and add something to this?' He said, 'No, this song is finished.' So that's a pretty good compliment, isn't it?\" Costello said.\n\nCostello also has an old song he wrote with Carole King in 1995 on the record which finds his voice stronger than ever. But Costello didn't always think of himself as a singer.\n\n\"No, not originally ... one of my favorite songwriters of my teenage years was Robbie Robertson. He didn't sing in the band. He was the main writer and yet there were three people in the band that sang. I just couldn't find a Rick Danko and a Richard Manuel and a Levon Helm to play with. So I had to do the singing myself. It was simple as that. You know it was forced upon me. Everybody took a step back and I was just left there.\"", "French artist Francoise Gilot has made a name for herself with her paintings, but it's two other names that have given her special notoriety. She was a longtime companion of Pablo Picasso and later, she was the wife of renowned scientist Dr. Jonas Salk. As a couple, they traveled all over the world, and now three of her sketchbooks from those trips have been published in a book by Taschen.\n\n\n\nGilot still has her sketchbook from her trip to Venice in 1974. She'd make observations, like that gondolas look like scorpions, and record her impressions of the city.\n\n\n\nShe'd been to Venice with her parents as a child. She was 53 when she made the trip again with her husband, the late Dr. Salk, pioneer of the polio vaccine. Now, she's 97, and having trouble getting used to the idea that she's just three years away from 100.\n\n\n\nBut she's still painting, and three of her travel sketchbooks were just published. At Sotheby's in New York last month, her fans clamored to get signed copies.\n\nCBS News\n\nAs for when she knew she wanted to be an artist, Gilot said it wasn't much of a decision.\n\n\"Well, you know that is something that is not necessarily willful,\" she said. \"From the age of 5, I started drawing a lot. Like for example, when I was at school, I was always drawing and that used to exasperate my teachers. They said, 'Are you listening?' I said, 'Yes, I am listening. The fact that I am drawing doesn't prevent me from listening.'\"\n\n\n\nShe was 22 when she met Pablo Picasso in Paris. The artist was 40 years older, but they'd spend a decade together until she became the only woman ever to leave him. She told Anthony Mason about it two years ago in an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning.\"\n\n\"I said, 'I am here because I love you, but the day when I don't love you I go.' 'Ha, ha, ha, nobody leaves a man like me.' I said, 'Wait and see,'\" Gilot recalled.\n\nThe day she left, according to Gilot, Picasso said \"merde.\"\n\nShe eventually found her way to New York and, as an artist, earned her own acclaim. With Salk, she traveled the world. They went to India in 1979 where she found herself fascinated by the saris.\n\n\n\nWhile in Senegal in 1981, she was drawn to the dancers. But with her sketchbooks she does less documenting of what she says and more of what she feels.\n\n\n\n\"I notice what I feel,\" Gilot said, \"Not what is there.\"\n\nShe said most of her drawing took place on a plane, from memory.\n\n\"I'm not somebody who is good at working from nature ... because reality is always contradicting me,\" she said. \"We all have that type of experience. That reality is just there to annoy you and limit us. No, it's not exactly like that, you know.\"\n\nGilot still works every day, and at 97, thinks about hitting that century mark, an imposing number.\n\n\n\n\"Well, if I got there, you know, why not a little bit more?\"\n\n", "This has not been a great year for big tech; on Wall Street or in Washington. For decades, companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have made vast sums monetizing the personal information of their users with almost no oversight or regulation. They are still making vast sums of money, but public attitudes about their size and power and their ability, or willingness, to police themselves are being called into question. A consensus is developing that something has to change and once again the impetus is coming from Europe which is becoming the world's leader in internet privacy and data protection. With a 31-year-old lawyer as the catalyst, the European Parliament has enacted a tough new law that has Silicon Valley scrambling to comply, and pressuring lawmakers here to do something about protecting your data.\n\nSeven times this year big tech has been called on the carpet to answer for data breaches, fake news, political meddling on the internet, and the endless amounts of personal information being gathered on Americans.\n\nSen. John Kennedy: I don't want to vote to have to regulate Facebook, but by God I will.\n\nSen. Mark Warner: The era of the Wild West in social media is coming to an end.\n\nSen. John Thune: The question is no longer whether we need a federal law to protect consumers' privacy, the question is what shape will that law take?\n\nIn Europe, they already have a law in place. After levying multi-billion dollar fines against Google for anti-competitive behavior, the European Union enacted the world's most ambitious internet privacy law, even winning support from the CEO of the biggest tech company in America, Apple's Tim Cook.\n\nReuters\n\nTim Cook: This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them.\n\nSpeaking in Brussels, Cook did not say which companies he was talking about but Apple wasn't one of them. Its business model is making and selling phones and computers, not marketing personal information for advertising like Google and Facebook.\n\nTim Cook: Our own information from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency. It is time for the rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead.\n\n\"Americans have no control today about the information that's collected about them every second of their lives.\"\n\nMost people would agree that the point man in Europe has been a spikey-haired 31-year-old Viennese lawyer named Max Schrems who has been inflicting misery in Silicon Valley for the past seven years. He not only brought international attention to the issue of data privacy, he brought big tech lawyers into court. In the information age, he says data is the most important commodity. The question is who does it belong to.\n\nSteve Kroft: Who owns your data?\n\nMax Schrems: The legislation here says it's you that your data belongs to.\n\nSteve Kroft: You should have control over it.\n\nMax Schrems: You should have control over that. However, in an environment where there is no such law, basically, whoever factually has the power over it, which is usually the big tech company, owns it, in that sense.\n\nMax Schrems was a major force in drafting the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR. It became law in May, after a long battle with big tech, and every company that does business in Europe, including the most powerful ones in America, must comply. It was designed specifically to ensure that consumers, not tech companies, have control over the collection and use of their own personal information.\n\nSteve Kroft: What kind of new rights does this law give European citizens that people in the United States might not have?\n\nMax Schrems: The default under the European system is you're not allowed to use someone else's data unless you have a justification. And the result of that is that you have rights, like a right that-- you walk up to a company and say, \"Delete everything you have about me.\" You have a right to access. So you can say, \"I want to have a copy of everything you have about me.\" And all of these little elements in the law, overall, are meant to give you that power over your data that in an information society we should probably have.\n\nCBS News\n\nAnd right now in the United States you have none of those legal rights.\n\nJeffrey Chester: Americans have no control today about the information that's collected about them every second of their lives.\n\nJeff Chester is the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy. He has been a major voice on digital privacy for two decades, and says the only Americans guaranteed privacy on the internet are children under 13. He says there are some limitations on some specific medical and financial information, but the internet has rendered them obsolete.\n\nJeffrey Chester: There are no rules, there's not a government agency really protecting them. Any-- the companies can do whatever they want in terms of gathering our information and using it in any way they see fit.\n\nSteve Kroft: How did the big tech companies come to collect all this information?\n\nJeffrey Chester: No one ever told them they couldn't collect it all. There've been no limits at all ever established.\n\nSteve Kroft: And that's what's going on with GDPR, somebody saying, \"You can't?\"\n\nJeffrey Chester: That's exactly right. GDPR says you can't collect it without permission.\n\nThe big tech companies have always argued that consumers have given them permission to take their personal data in exchange for using the product. It's buried in the fine print on those long impenetrable online privacy agreements that you have to click on. Max Schrems says it's not free choice but constitutes coercion under the new European law.\n\nOn the day it was enacted Schrems' nonprofit group \"None of Your Business\" took action against Facebook and Google for allegedly violating European privacy laws.\n\nMax Schrems: It's this take it or leave it approach. You know it whenever you open an app it says, \"agree, or don't use the app\" and your choice is basically not existent because either you go offline \u2013 or you have to agree.\n\nSchrems cited the example of Google's Android operating system, the software which runs up to 80% of the world's smartphones. But to use one, you must first activate it and give Google consent to collect your personal data on all of its products.\n\nMax Schrems: You paid $1,000 right now and you're not allowed to use your $1,000 phone unless you agree that all the data goes to someone else. And that is basically forced consent.\n\nSteve Kroft: The tech companies say, \"Look, you, the user, you gave us permission to take this information to use it the way we wanted to. You agreed to it.\"\n\nMax Schrems: And that--\n\nSteve Kroft: \"You signed on. You made the deal.\"\n\nMax Schrems: The individual doesn't have the power, the time, the legal expertise to understand any of that. And then you're sitting at home at your desk and have the option to only say yes. This is not what any reasonable person would consider a fair deal.\n\nSchrems has been waging this battle since 2011 when he spent a semester in California at Santa Clara University School of Law. A lawyer from Facebook told his class that big tech didn't pay any attention to European privacy laws because they were rarely enforced and that the fines were very small.\n\nMax Schrems: it was obviously the case that ignoring European privacy laws was the much cheaper option. The maximum penalty, for example, in Austria was 20,000 euros. So just a lawyer telling you how to comply with the law was more expensive than breaking it.\n\nAt the time most people had no idea how much personal information was being collected on them, so when the 23-year-old Schrems returned to Austria he decided to ask Facebook if he could see what they had collected on him. By mistake or miracle, someone at Facebook sent him this stack of information, lifting the veil on the extent of the company's interest in him.\n\nMax Schrems: And after a while I got a PDF file with 1,200 pages after using Facebook for three years and I'm not a heavy user or anything like that.\n\nCBS News\n\nFacebook had created a dossier of max's life. That included his location history, events he attended, all of his contact information and his private Facebook messages, even the ones he thought he had deleted.\n\nSteve Kroft: So these were personal conversations you had that you thought were between yourself and the other person?\n\nMax Schrems: Yeah.\n\nSteve Kroft: And they're all here?\n\nMax Schrems: They're all here, and they're basically undeletable.\n\nIt created a huge stir at the time, but it's nothing compared to what's being gathered now. Today, Facebook collects information on people who don't even have an account. Google's Android software knows whether the user is walking, running, or riding in a car. And Amazon has patented algorithms that could be used on its Echo smart speaker to listen in on continuous conversations, and even read the mood of people in the room.\n\nMax Schrems: The reality is that this industry is so fast-moving right now, even if you have perfect enforcement mechanisms, usually they will get away with it. Unless there is a serious penalty.\n\nToday, if one of the big tech companies chooses to ignore Europe's new data protection law it could cost them 4 percent of their global revenues, which for the biggest companies would mean billions of dollars.\n\nThose decisions will likely be made here in Dublin, the busiest of Europe's 28 data protection centers, and the place where most American tech companies have their European headquarters. They flocked here years ago because of Ireland's low corporate taxes and its reputation for relaxed regulation.\n\nIreland's data protection commissioner Helen Dixon says it's not going to be business as usual.\n\nHelen Dixon: U.S. internet companies have no doubt that this law is serious, it has serious bite And all of them are eager to avoid any engagement with that.\n\nSteve Kroft: How would you describe your relationship with these companies right now? Is the relationship cooperative or contentious?\n\nHelen Dixon: It's all of those things in any one week.\n\nCBS News\n\nDixon says tech companies are spending tens of millions of dollars hiring lawyers, compliance officers and engineers to make sure they are operating within the law. The data protection authorities have only a few thousand employees in Europe to police some of the most powerful companies in the world, but they have subpoena power, can conduct raids, and even shut down operations.\n\nSteve Kroft: You think the big tech companies, the people in Silicon Valley are taking this seriously?\n\nEoin O'Dell: I think they have to.\n\nEoin O'Dell is a law professor at Trinity College in Dublin and a leading expert on European privacy law. He says Europe has now established an international standard for internet privacy, and companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon are not about to retreat from a $17 trillion market.\n\nEoin O'Dell: We have safety standards in cars, but that hasn't stopped us driving cars. We have emissions standards for \u2013 for the gas in the cars but that hasn't stopped us using the gas in the cars . The data companies are \u2013 going to comply in the same way as the \u2013 car companies have complied\n\nSteve Kroft: To stay in business.\n\nEoin O'Dell: To stay in business.\n\nSince the European privacy law was passed, at least ten other countries have adopted similar rules. So has the state of California.\n\nPerhaps sensing the inevitable, Facebook, Twitter, Google and Amazon are now saying they could support a U.S. privacy law if they were given considerable input. The Internet Association, which lobbies for big tech, and its president Michael Beckerman say they would support giving Americans reasonable access to their information and some privacy rights now enjoyed by the Europeans.\n\nCBS News\n\nSteve Kroft: From your point of view, who owns the data that's collected?\n\nMichael Beckerman: I think individuals should have complete control over their information. You should have access to it, both how you're giving it in the online world and offline world, and full transparency on who has the information and what you're getting for it.\n\nSteve Kroft: But who owns it?\n\nMichael Beckerman: People should have control over it. I don't view it as an ownership, you know, the way you're-- the way you're asking. But I think the individual--\n\nSteve Kroft: The Europeans do, the Europeans says it's a right. You own your information. You have a right--\n\nMichael Beckerman: We have--\n\nSteve Kroft: --to go to the companies and say, \"I want this information.\"\n\nMichael Beckerman: Under the law that we're pushing, and the rules that we're pushing, and what our companies already do, people can download the information-- their personal information that they've shared with the sites, and delete it if they want, and cancel their accounts.\n\nPrivacy advocate Jeff Chester says the industry wants people to believe that it's cooperating and open to change, but that it won't do anything until it's forced to by law.\n\nJeffrey Chester: This is simply a bait and switch in terms of protecting privacy in America today. The companies have no intention of supporting a privacy law that actually would stop them from collecting our information and give Americans the same rights the Europeans now have.\n\nProduced by Maria Gavrilovic.

Associate producer, Alex Ortiz.", "The PGA of America started a new chapter Friday night when it swore in the first female president in the organization's 102-year history. Suzy Whaley now leads one of the world's largest working sports organizations, and she plans to change it for the better.\n\nAs a young girl growing up in Syracuse, New York, Whaley craved sunshine, skiing and outdoor sports. But she found her true passion on the driving range.\n\nThe Title IX era was just beginning, so Whaley competed on a boy's high school golf team since there wasn't one for the girls. Still, gender wasn't an issue until Whaley tried entering a tournament and found it was only for boys, reports \"CBS This Morning: Saturday\" co-host Dana Jacobson.\n\n\"I didn't think it was fair and I remember thinking, 'Well I don't understand, I just want to play golf. I want to have fun playing golf just like they do.' But we didn't dwell on that in my house,\" Whaley said. \"And my parents ended up moving clubs where I was allowed to play, right? So there was just always this support that if you want to do it, go do it the best you can. ... And that's really the way my sister and I both grew up. We weren't afraid to fail.\"\n\nWith that support behind her, Whaley played collegiate golf. She then passed on law school to go to PGA tour school. She competed in some LPGA Tour events where she met her husband, Bill, also a PGA professional, and they started a family. That's when Whaley realized she wanted more opportunities to play.\n\n\"I watched my husband play in these tournaments literally weekly, and it was aggravating. I wanted to play against him and I wanted to win!\" Whaley said.\n\nThat tradition of support continued with Bill, who encouraged her to join the PGA of America. In 2002, while working as a head golf pro in Connecticut, Whaley became the first woman to qualify for a PGA Tour event in 58 years \u2013 and just the third ever.\n\n\"We celebrated and about two minutes after I had signed my scorecard finishing the event, I had a phone call. It was the PGA tour asking me if I was going to accept the exemption. ... I said, 'Can I have some time to think about it?'\" Whaley recalled. \"I hadn't even considered it! I hadn't even \u2013 I really honestly had never imagined that they would allow a woman to play on the PGA Tour.\"\n\nThe win kicked off a media storm with Whaley, fielding about 3,500 interviews. Three months later, she still hadn't decided on playing. It was her then 9-year-old daughter Jenn who helped her make the decision.\n\n\"We were reading a story at night as we always did and it was about taking opportunities and taking chances and being brave and when we finished the story she said, 'Well then mom, why aren't you playing?' And I said, 'Well you know, I am.' And I walked down the stairs and that was the night I told my husband I was in,\" she said.\n\nSince then, three other female golfers have competed in a PGA Tour event, and Whaley has spent her career promoting inclusion in the sport. But leading that effort as one of the sport's top instructors wasn't enough, so in 2014, she decided to run for secretary of the PGA of America \u2013 a path that automatically leads to the presidency. She faced a delegation of 111 men and only three women. Whaley got the votes needed, becoming the first woman elected a national officer of the PGA of America.\n\nA month before the election, the PGA of America fired its president for using sexist language on social media. Four years later, Whaley is taking over that role.\n\n\"One of our biggest challenges I think, which I look at as an enormous opportunity, is getting more people on our golf courses. We want to welcome women to golf courses. We want more junior girls and junior boys playing golf,\" she said. \"Can you wear sneakers? Absolutely. Do you have to have a golf outfit? No you do not. Do you have to have equipment? No. Most facilities across the country have equipment for you. You can just walk right in the door and do it.\"\n\nInclusivity in a sport known for its exclusivity -- and while that's something Whaley learned firsthand, for her, golf was never about breaking down barriers. It was -- and is -- about the love of the game.\n\n\"I'm blessed, and I have this amazing association that has given me opportunities that are tremendous. And giving back to that is something that I cherish. ... It's just given me so much. I'm just incredibly grateful.\"", "Election Day was last week, but several of the biggest races have yet to be called. Florida's gubernatorial and Senate races and the Georgia gubernatorial race are still up in the air, with slim margins between Democratic and Republican candidates.\n\nHere's a look at where things stand in the marquee races that have yet to be decided -- and one that just was:\n\nFlorida: Senate and governor races\n\nSen. Bill Nelson has called on Republican Gov. Rick Scott to recuse himself from \"any role\" in Florida's recount process as supervisors of elections across the state begin the mandatory machine recount of more than 8.2 million ballots cast in this year's U.S. Senate race.\n\nDuring an emergency hearing Monday, Circuit Chief Judge Jack Tuter said he's seen no evidence of wrongdoing in the vote-counting in Broward County and urged all sides to \"ramp down the rhetoric.\" Tuter said there is a need to reassure citizens that the integrity of the Florida recount is being protected.\n\nBut President Trump again alleged without evidence that the state was dealing with voter fraud, tweeting Monday morning that \"large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged.\"\n\nThe state's law enforcement arm and elections monitors have found no evidence of wrongdoing, but lawyers for the Republican Party and the GOP candidates joined with Mr. Trump in alleging that irregularities, unethical behavior and fraud have taken place since the polls closed last week.\n\nAdditional sheriff's deputies were sent to guard ballots and voting machines in Broward County Monday. And Tuter said no Republican who's publicly alleged fraud in Broward's process has filed a criminal complaint.\n\nFlorida election law dictates a machine recount must be undertaken if the margin between two candidates is within half a percentage point.\n\nScott is leading incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson by less than 15,000 votes, or roughly .2 percent. Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis is leading Democrat Andrew Gillum by less than 40,000 votes, around .4 percent.\n\nScott will be in Washington, D.C., this week for new Senate member orientation, despite the recount.\n\nScott has filed multiple lawsuits over the recount, including ones directed at the elections officials in Broward and Palm Beach counties.\n\nScott won two lawsuits last week to crack open records kept by elections officials open. He filed further lawsuits on Sunday in an attempt to keep elections officials from counting ballots submitted past Election Day.\n\nIf the machine recount finds one or both of the races to be within one quarter of a percentage point, a manual recount will be held.\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum expressed outrage Monday evening that some voters in hurricane-ravaged Bay County had been allowed to vote by email against state rules.\n\nGillum spoke at an African-American church in Boynton Beach.\n\nElections Supervisor Mark Andersen in heavily Republican Bay County told the Miami Herald earlier on Monday that he allowed about 150 people to cast ballots by email, which is illegal under state law.\n\n\"These are the stories that we know,\" Gillum said. \"Imagine the ones that we don't.\"\n\nMr. Trump tweeted earlier Monday that the election should be called for Gillum's Republican opponent, Ron DeSantis, and Gov. Rick Scott, who is running for U.S. Senate. Mr. Trump said an honest vote count is no longer possible.\n\nGillum disagreed with the tweet, saying, \"Not one supervisor, not one governor, not one president - if that's what we want to call him -- should be able to take away our sense of hope.\"\n\nGillum questioned the Republicans' rush to stop counting votes when the new governor won't be sworn in until January.\n\n\n\nGeorgia governor race\n\nA federal judge in Atlanta has ordered Georgia to wait until Friday to certify the results of the midterm elections that include the unsettled race for governor and to take steps to protect provisional ballots.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg ruled late Monday that Georgia must not certify the election results before Friday at 5 p.m., which falls before the Nov. 20 deadline set by state law.\n\nBut state elections director Chris Harvey testified at a hearing last week that the state had planned to certify the election results on Wednesday, a day after the deadline for counties to certify their results. He said that would allow preparations to begin for a runoff, which is already projected in the secretary of state race.\n\nTotenberg also ordered the secretary of state's office to establish a hotline or website where voters can check whether their provisional ballots were counted and, if not, the reason why. And, for counties with 100 or more provisional ballots, she ordered the secretary of state's office to review, or have county election officials review, the eligibility of voters who had to cast a provisional ballot because of registration issues.\n\nCurrent unofficial returns show Republican Brian Kemp leading by a margin that would make him the victor in one of the nation's premier midterm election contests. But Democrat Stacey Abrams maintains enough outstanding votes remain to pull Kemp below the majority threshold and force a Dec. 4 runoff.\n\nTotenberg's order stemmed from a lawsuit filed Nov. 5 by Common Cause Georgia. It accuses Kemp, who was the state's top elections official until he resigned as secretary of state last week, of acting recklessly after a vulnerability in Georgia's voter registration database was exposed shortly before the election.\n\nKemp's actions increased the risk that eligible voters could be illegally removed from the voter registration database or have registration information illegally altered, the lawsuit says.\n\nSara Henderson, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, said in an emailed statement that the ruling helps increase voter confidence in elections. A spokeswoman for the secretary of state's office did not respond to an email sent late Monday seeking comment.\n\nTotenberg's order doesn't change the Tuesday deadline for counties to certify their results. But Abrams' campaign filed a lawsuit Sunday asking a federal court to push that deadline to Wednesday, while also requiring that elections authorities count certain provisional and absentee ballots that have been or would be rejected for \"arbitrary reasons.\"\n\nA judge ruled absentee ballots rejected because of issues with the date of birth listed should be counted on Tuesday.\n\n\"The rulings from last night and this morning were wins for Georgians' fundamental right - the right to cast a ballot,\" Abrams campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo said in a statement on the rulings. \"Given the confusion sowed by the Secretary of State's office last week and the number of voters who experienced irregularities regarding their registration status, these victories were necessary steps in the fight to count every eligible vote in Georgia.\n\nAbrams said in a statement explaining her refusal to end her bid to become the first black woman elected governor in American history that she was \"fighting to make sure our democracy works for and represents everyone who has ever put their faith in it.\"\n\nKemp's campaign retorted that Abrams' latest effort is \"a disgrace to democracy\" and ignores mathematical realities. \"Clearly, Stacey Abrams isn't ready for her 15 minutes of fame to end,\" said Kemp spokesman Ryan Mahoney.\n\nUnofficial returns show Kemp with a lead just shy of 60,000 votes out of more than 3.9 million cast; Abrams would need a net gain of about 21,000 votes to force a Dec. 4 runoff.\n\nAccusations of voter suppression cast a shadow over the vote tabulation. Kemp was Georgia secretary of state until his resignation Thursday. During his tenure, his office removed 1.5 million voters from the rolls. His office also suspended the registration of 53,000 voters shortly before the election, 70 percent of whom were black, although a judge ruled these voters could cast a ballot on election day. Democrats argue Kemp's seeming victory is due to tactics of voter suppression.\n\nArizona Senate race\n\nIn a year of liberal challenges to Mr. Trump, an avowed centrist scored the Democratic Party's biggest coup -- flipping a red state's U.S. Senate seat.\n\nRep. Kyrsten Sinema won the Arizona Senate seat being vacated by Republican Jeff Flake. The race against Republican Rep. Martha McSally was tight enough that a winner wasn't decided until Monday, after a slow count of mail-in ballots gave her an insurmountable lead.\n\nSinema's win achieves a longtime Democratic goal of making Arizona, with its growing Latino population, a competitive state. And she did it by pointedly not running against the president, or even critiquing his hardline immigration stance.\n\n\"She didn't put the progressive bit in her mouth and run with it,\" said Chuck Coughlin, a GOP strategist in Phoenix. \"She spit it out and did something else.\"\n\nSinema targeted moderate Republican and independent women by painting herself as a nonpartisan problem-solver who voted to support Trump's agenda 60 percent of the time. Her nearly single-issue campaign talked about the importance of health care and protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nShe knew McSally was vulnerable there because she backed the Republicans' failed attempt to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law.\n\nSinema tailored her campaign for conservative-leaning Arizona rather than the national environment, but it may be a guide for Democrats who hope to expand the electoral map in 2020. While some liberals won important races in California, Colorado and Kansas, the left's highest-profile champions disappointed on Election Day.\n\nGrace Segers contributed to this report", "President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump are taking part in memorial events in France this weekend to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. Meanwhile, across the channel in London, a very public tribute is lighting the night sky to remember those Britain lost in the \"war to end all wars.\"\n\nAs a bugler played \"The Last Post\" on the Tower of London wall, a flame appeared carried by one of the tower's ceremonial Beefeater guards. One flame became two, then three. Civilian volunteers began lighting the others until a massive river of fire surrounded the ancient tower. Eventually, 10,000 lights filled the dry moat to honor the hundreds of thousands who fell in a war that ended a century ago.\n\n\"The flames to me represent both the kind of spirit and the energy of all those lost men but also the hope of peace,\" said the tribute's designer Tom Piper. He said the flickering flames represent something else, too: the fragile nature of peace.\n\n\"We have to safeguard our democracy even now,\" he said.\n\nThe commemoration featured a soundtrack of powerful poetry that speaks of love and death, written by long-forgotten American Mary Borden, a wealthy Chicago socialite who had moved to England with her British husband.\n\nWhen WWI broke out, she set up and worked at a field hospital on the front lines. There she met a British officer, who would become her second husband, and to whom she wrote the words that now complement the flames.\n\n\"You would not falter at the last my friend nor put to shame your clear courageous mind under the menace of the desolate end,\" the poem reads.\n\n\"I'm totally in awe of this woman. I'm so glad the world has sort of woken up to her a little bit because too often female artists seem to vanish from history,\" said Mira Calix, the sound artist who discovered Borden's poems.\n\nNow, like those she wrote about, Mary Borden is again part of the history of that terrible time.\n\n", "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Voters in conservative Utah have decided to join the growing number of states legalizing medical marijuana and expanding Medicaid to cover tens of thousands more low-income residents \u2014 two issues that had long stalled out with conservative state lawmakers.\n\nUtah will be on the list of more than 30 states allowing patients legal access to medical marijuana after the plan maintained a vote lead in Friday tabulations. The measure will be revised, though, under a compromise that won the approval of influential Mormon church leaders.\n\nThe faith had opposed the ballot proposal over fears it could lead to broader use, but after months of fierce debate agreed to the deal. It will change the law by blocking marijuana edibles like cookies that might appeal to children and won't allow people to grow their own marijuana if they live too far from a dispensary.\n\nThe state Legislature is expected to meet in early December to hammer out the details of revising the newly passed law.\n\nMissouri also passed a medical marijuana initiative in this midterm election. Michigan became the first Midwestern state to legalize recreational marijuana while North Dakota voted against it.\n\nUtah's approval of medical marijuana shows the state's residents can think for themselves despite opposition from powerful groups such as the Utah Chiefs of Police Association, Utah Medical Association and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Utah's population, said DJ Schanz, director of the group that put the proposition on the ballot.\n\n\"We're excited that these sick and ailing patients will finally be able to find relief without being criminalized in Utah,\" said Schanz, director of the Utah Patients Coalition. \"This a big message that Utahns are compassionate people ... that people can think and vote autonomously.\"\n\nWith the Medicaid vote, Utah joins two other Republican-leaning states, Idaho and Nebraska, where voters also approved expanding the program under President Barack Obama's health care law. The measure includes a sales tax increase that is expected to generate $90 million that will combine with $800 million in federal money to fund the expansion.\n\nState lawmakers, however, remain concerned the plan wouldn't cover the cost of the program. Incoming Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson said Friday the state already struggles to fund schools because of the state's large families, so lawmakers fear full Medicaid expansion could cut into education dollars.\n\n\"The legislature has some tough decisions to make regarding which programs will receive less funding in the future,\" he said in a statement.\n\nCurtis, though, said advocates calculated the sales-tax increase to more than cover the costs estimated by state analysts.", "Writer Kenneth Lonergan's \"The Waverly Gallery\" is a story of family relationships and a grandmother's last years in decline. It's just opened on Broadway, starring Elaine May, Lucas Hedges and Joan Allen.\n\n\"I want to tell you what happened to my grandmother, Gladys Green, near the end of her life.\"\n\nIt is a play whose beginnings trace back to the late 1970s, when the lives of two teenagers, and a gallery owner, intersected in New York's Greenwich Village.\n\n\"I grew up a few blocks right down the street, across the street from the Waverly Gallery,\" said Lonergan's childhood friend, the celebrated actor Matthew Broderick. \"And I would see his grandmother in there before I knew Kenny.\"\n\nCBS News\n\nAt fifteen, Lonergan and Broderick met in school, at auditions for \"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\" Almost immediately, they began taking note of who got what role. \"He got a bigger, much bigger part than me,\" Broderick told correspondent Serena Altschul.\n\n\"Yeah, but you got a better part!\" Lonergan laughed.\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\n\"I think it's a better part, yeah.\" [Broderick was the Wall, and Lonergan was Demetrius.]\n\nAlthough he had the chops to perform even Shakespeare, Lonergan didn't stick with acting. \"I started writing plays, I guess, in ninth grade, and I was really interested in writing all through high school, really,\" he said.\n\nCBS News\n\nIn fact, he went on to write and direct a movie, 2000's \"You Can Count on Me.\" \"For a movie, if you're not going to direct it, you might as well say goodbye to the material forever if you're the writer,\" he said.\n\nFamily Photo\n\nAll the while he was writing plays, of course, like \"The Starry Messenger\" featuring Broderick and Lonergan's wife, J. Smith-Cameron.\n\nAnd last year, his \"Manchester By the Sea\" earned Lonergan an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, and a Best Director nomination.\n\nA constant of his films: his movie-star pal. \"Always a little, teeny [role]. And they get smaller and smaller, as time passes,\" Broderick laughed.\n\n\"Yeah, they have gotten smaller and smaller,\" Lonergan said.\n\n\"Eventually I'll just walk by!\"\n\nKidding aside, their support for each other is unwavering. So it's no surprise that Broderick was there when Lonergan's once-vibrant grandmother began showing signs of dementia.\n\n\"It was very gradual,\" Broderick said. \"I knew about thinking her dog was still alive. That always broke my heart, that she had to be told, again, that her dog was dead, 'cause she'd forgotten.

In this revival, Lucas Hedges plays a version of a young Lonergan; his mother is played by Tony Award-winning actress Joan Allen. The grandmother, Gladys, is played by the legendary comedy writer and actress Elaine May. She last appeared on Broadway more than 50 years ago with another legend, Mike Nichols.\n\nBrigitte Lacombe\n\nMay is \"incredible in the part,\" Lonergan said.\n\nWhy was she perfect for it? \"There's this uncanny resonance that's both Elaine [and] the character she's playing, and my grandmother,\" he said.\n\nAnd Broderick says her performance shows an anguish that's usually kept private. \"It's rare that somebody has held a glass up to it like that intensely and that accurately,\" he said.\n\nLonergan said, \"They don't understand that they don't understand. And they don't see themselves as someone who should be put on the shelf.\"\n\nIt's said that Kenneth Lonergan's works are timeless, and that \"The Waverly Gallery\" might just be his best so far.\n\nOf course, Matthew Broderick sees them as only a best friend can: \"I love all of them, to tell you the truth. I really can't pick, and I can't pick from his three wonderful movies. I like all of 'em.\n\n\"I like the first movie because I have a larger part in it!\" he laughed.\n\nREAD AN EXTENDED TRANSCRIPT: Serena Altschul's interview with Kenneth Lonergan\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\"The Waverly Gallery\" at the Golden Theatre, New York City (through January 27, 2019) | Ticket info\n\nThanks to Minetta Tavern, New York City\n\n\n\nStory produced by Mary Raffalli.", "Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S., but colonoscopies have been found to reduce the risk of death from the disease by 70 percent by finding and removing benign polyps before they have time to turn into cancer. Doctors, however, don't always find every polyp.\n\nAs a gastroenterologist, CBS News medical contributor Dr. Jon LaPook knows all too well that colon polyps can be tough to spot. They may be partly hiding behind a fold, or so flat and subtle that they're barely visible to the eye.\n\nA new high-tech tool may be able to help doctors spot them. LaPook decided to give the new technology a test run -- not as a doctor, but as a patient.\n\nThe colonoscopy was performed by Dr. Mark Pochapin, chief of gastroenterology at NYU Langone Health. Assisting Dr. Pochapin is a second set of eyes: a computer powered by artificial intelligence.\n\n\"The good news is what we do really prevent cancer \u2026 but we do miss polyps, and we have to recognize that anybody, no matter how good they are, has the potential to miss something because we're only human,\" Pochapin said.\n\nA recent study published in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering found artificial intelligence was able to detect polyps more than 90 percent of the time. Researchers in China had fed the computer more than 5,000 images from colonoscopies, and the computer used those pictures to teach itself to recognize polyps.\n\nDr. Seth Gross is heading one of the first studies exploring whether AI can help find polyps not just in a computer lab but in patients actually undergoing colonoscopy.\n\n\"The parts that we're trying to improve upon detection are those flat ones, very subtle. \u2026 And this is where artificial intelligence can be most helpful,\" Gross said.\n\nLaPook is one of the early participants in the study, which began about two months ago. The first polyp spotted by the AI in LaPook's colon was very subtle, small and flat. Pochapin removed it but can't say for sure whether he or the computer spotted it first. As Pochapin withdrew the instrument, the AI spotted another small polyp.\n\nWe're happy to report that the polyps were totally benign, and not precancerous. LaPook's colonoscopy also highlighted the importance of doing a good job with the prep. His polyps were so subtle, they could easily have been missed if the lining of the colon wasn't clean.", "bad url", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Growing up in New Jersey, Sott Tacinelli shared his Italian-American family's passion for food.

Make the oven-dried tomatoes: Set the oven to 225\u00b0F. Spray an oven rack with non-stick cooking spray. Place the oven rack over a roasting tray. Drain San Marzano tomatoes, reserving the tomato juice. Mix sugar, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Place the drained tomatoes on the oven rack. Sprinkle the salt mixture over the drained tomatoes, coating as evenly as possible. Place the tomatoes in the oven and allow to cook until tomatoes are partially dried, about 1 hour. Remove tomatoes from oven and let them cool before roughly chopping them.\n\n2. Make the garganelli: Place dry ingredients in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Gradually add in the yolks and whole eggs. Depending on the humidity of the environment, more or less whole eggs will be needed to achieve desired consistency. Dough should appear a bit dry and firm; it will soften and relax as it sits and hydrates. Remove from mixer, wrap in plastic and allow to rest for at least an hour. Pass through sheeter, cut into 3-inch squares, then roll each square into a giant garganelli shape using a 1\" diameter dowel and a cavarola board. Store in freezer until ready to cook.\n\n3. Make the meatballs: Heat the oven to 450\u00b0F. Wrap the garlic in foil and cook until roasted and soft, about 30 minutes. Squeeze the garlic out, discarding the skins, and place in a large bowl with the beef, veal, cheeses, pepper, salt, parsley, and egg. Place the bread in a large bowl and cover with the milk. Let sit for 5 minutes, then squeeze out all the milk, discarding it. Add the bread to the bowl with the meat and cheeses. Meanwhile, place the onion in a food processor and pur\u00e9e. Squeeze out all the liquid, then add the onion to the bowl. Gently mix until everything is combined, taking care not to overmix. Roll into 2 ounce|50 gram balls (about 2 tablespoons). Transfer to a baking sheet and bake for 12 minutes, rotating halfway through. Allow to cool and then break meatballs into smaller pieces. Set aside.\n\n4. Make the guanciale sauce: Place the guanciale in a large saucepan over medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the fat has rendered, about 5 minutes. Add the onion and chili flakes and cook until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the tomato juice and chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Cook until reduced and thick, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Set aside to cool.\n\n5. Make the breadcrumbs: Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet over medium. Add the garlic, thyme, and bay leaf and cook until the garlic is golden, 2 1/2 minutes. Add the breadcrumbs, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring, until the breadcrumbs are golden, 4 minutes. Lay the finished bread crumbs out on paper towels to cool. Set aside.\n\n6. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. In a saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat, cook garlic and shallot in olive oil until fragrant and garlic is cooked through, 2 1/2 minutes. Add guanciale sauce and tomato juice and bring to a simmer. Cook until reduced by half, 4 minutes. Add the oven dried tomatoes and meatballs.

The cause of the blazes was not known.\n\nFor Thousand Oaks, which had been considered one of the safest cities in the nation before a gunman massacred 12 people at a country music bar, the spasm of violence jolted the city's sense of security. Encroaching flames, despite the near-constant threat of fire in the bone-dry state, presented an entirely different hazard.\n\n\"It's devastating. It's like 'welcome to hell,'\" resident Cynthia Ball said about the dual disasters while she was outside the teen center serving as a shelter for evacuees. \"I don't even know what to say. It's like we're all walking around kind of in a trance.\"\n\nA day earlier, the facility had been the location where grieving family members had gathered and received the grim news on the fate of loved ones who had not returned from the Borderline Bar and Grill, where a Marine combat veteran went on a shooting rampage Wednesday. The investigation into what drove 28-year-old Ian David Long to kill was continuing even as the city about 40 miles from Los Angeles was under threat. Three-quarters of the city of 130,000 was under evacuation orders, and that likely included people affected by the shooting, Thousand Oaks Mayor Andy Fox said.\n\n\"Here we are just a few hours later talking now about another crisis right here in Thousand Oaks,\" Fox said, making the distinction that the shooting victims and their families had experienced a permanent loss. \"Those lives will never be recovered. Tonight we're talking about a serious fire situation, but thankfully we have not lost a single life. And as difficult as it may be, homes can be rebuilt, property can be reacquired.\"\n\n\n\nIn the city, flames creeping down a hillside were visible from a teen center on Janss Road.\n\nEvacuees described harrowing escapes from flames that picked up unexpectedly Thursday afternoon. At the Vallecito mobile home park for seniors, the fire came so quickly that residents had no time to gather medications and documents.\n\nVentura County Supervisor Peter Foy made a plea at a fire news conference to residents to help their neighbors during this difficult time. \"We appreciate everybody's efforts and kind prayers for all the people from our victims that lost their lives in the shooting to now what's happening with people losing their homes,\" he said.\n\nThree major fires are burning in California. In addition to the Woolsey and Hill blazes burning in Southern Carolina, the Camp Fire in the north has left a town in ruins. At least nine people have been killed by that blaze, which burned 90,000 acres and destroyed more than 6,700 structures.", "President Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron worked Saturday to ease tensions after a dustup over their comments about European security that threatened to divert attention away from a weekend celebration marking 100 years since the end of World War I.\n\nThe American and French leaders, who have had somewhat of an up-and-down relationship, worked to project unity on whether Europe should create an army as they addressed reporters before they retreated behind closed doors at the Elysee Palace.\n\nMr. Trump's visit to France opened on a testy note after he unleashed an angry Twitter jab at his host as he arrived for the celebration. Just as Air Force One touched down in Paris Friday night, Mr. Trump tweeted that Macron \"has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\"\n\nMacron's office said Mr. Trump misunderstood Macron's comments about sharing the defense burden and the two men struck a more friendly tone as they opened their meeting at the grand presidential residence.\n\n\"We want to help Europe but it has to be fair. Right now, the burden-sharing has been largely on the United States,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that Macron \"understands that and he understands the United States can only do so much, in fairness to the United States.\"\n\nMr. Trump added that the U.S. wants to \"absolutely be there\" to help defend Europe but that \"different countries have to also help.\"\n\nMacron defended his viewpoint, saying \"I do share President Trump's views that we need a much better burden sharing with NATO and that's why I do believe that my proposal for a European defense\" is \"utterly consistent with that.\"\n\nMacron said it's \"unfair to have the European security today being assured just by the United States.\"\n\nJacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nAn official in Macron's office said Mr. Trump lumped together two different comments by the French president, and that the leaders would discuss the comments. By custom, the official was not authorized to be publicly named.\n\nMacron said in an interview earlier this week that Europe needs to protect itself against \"China, Russia and even the United States\" in terms of cyberspace. Later, Macron reiterated that Europe needs to build up its own military because it can no longer depend on the U.S. for defense.\n\nMr. Trump has made similar arguments, particularly in urging NATO members to increase their defense spending.\n\nIt was the latest instance of Mr. Trump introducing tension before meeting with a world leader, then playing nice when they were face to face. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump insulted British Prime Minister Theresa May at an especially vulnerable time for her government in an interview with a British tabloid. He also threatened not to work toward a trade deal with Britain and said May's political nemesis would make a great prime minister. The interview was published as Mr. Trump attended a grand welcome dinner hosted by May hours after he arrived in London.\n\nBut Mr. Trump was far more cordial to May's face. He complimented her leadership and expressed his great respect for her.\n\nMr. Trump's comments aside, Macron welcomed Mr. Trump in the courtyard of the Elysee Palace with a handshake and pats on the arm. Inside a gilded meeting room, Macron referred to Mr. Trump as \"my good friend\" and tapped him on the thigh. Mr. Trump said they had become \"very good friends over the last couple of years\" and were \"similar in our views\" on many issues.\n\nThe tweet by Mr. Trump marked a fresh sign that the \"America first\" president was ready to go his own way yet again as world leaders gather to remember the coalition that brought an end to the first global war in which millions were killed.\n\nMr. Trump was joining scores of other world leaders for a Sunday ceremony in the shadow of the Arc de Triomphe to mark the WWI centennial. On Saturday afternoon, Macron will meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the town of Compiegne in northern France, BBC News reports.\n\nOn Saturday, the White House called off Mr. Trump's scheduled visit to a World War I cemetery due to poor weather. The Aisne-Marne American Cemetery is the site of a 1918 battle in which the American and French repelled German forces. More than 1,800 Americans died there.\n\nWhite House chief of staff John Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, his wife and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will visit instead.", "\"Sunday Morning\" took us this morning to Stinson Lake, at White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire.

Hassain Khalif Shire Ali, 30, had his passport canceled in 2015 after it was learned he planned to travel to Syria, police said.\n\nThe attack occurred on Friday when Shire Ali got out of a pickup vehicle, which he then set on fire, and stabbed three men, one of whom died at the scene. The attack horrified hundreds of onlookers during the afternoon rush hour in Australia's second-biggest city.\n\nVictoria state Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said Shire Ali, who was shot by police and died in a hospital, had also made an \"unsophisticated\" plan for his vehicle to explode to cause many more fatalities. He had placed several barbecue gas canisters in the back of his pickup, with the outlet valves open, but they had failed to ignite.\n\n\"It looks like he's attempted to ignite a fire in the car, we believe at this stage with a view to igniting those canisters with some sort of explosion, but that didn't eventuate,\" Ashton told reporters.\n\nShire Ali, who moved to Australia with his family from Somalia in the 1990s, was known to police and the federal intelligence authority ASIO. He had a criminal history for cannabis use, theft and driving offences, Ashton said.\n\nAustralian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Ian McCartney told a media briefing on Saturday it was believed the attack was inspired by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), though it was thought Shire Ali had no direct links to the organization.\n\nREUTERS\n\n\"It's fair to say he was inspired. He was radicalized, with the rise of the caliphate and the propaganda that was put out on the internet. We're not saying there was direct contact. We're saying it was more from an inspirational perspective,\" McCartney said.\n\nMcCartney said the incident was a \"reality check\" for security agencies that \"even with the fall of the (ISIS) caliphate ... the threat continues to be real.\"\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said \"radical, violent, extremist Islam\" poses the greatest threat to Australia's national security.\n\n\"Here in Australia, we would be kidding ourselves if we did not call out the fact that the greatest threat of religious extremism in this country is the radical and dangerous ideology of extremist Islam,\" he said.\n\nMorrison said he had long-standing relationships with the Muslim community and it was them who had raised with him concerns about radicalism in recent years.\n\nShire Ali had family and associates who were also known to police. His brother Ali Khalif Shire Ali is currently on remand awaiting trial next year for allegedly planning an attack, Ashton said.\n\nISIS claimed responsibility for Friday's attack but provided no evidence. It said the man was an ISIS fighter and had responded to the group's calls for attacks in countries that are part of the international coalition fighting the militants in Syria and Iraq.\n\nPolice and civilians had tried unsuccessfully to subdue Shire Ali before he was shot in the chest by a police officer, who Ashton said only graduated from the police academy three months ago.\n\nA man aged 74, who had been stabbed in the face, died at the scene. Two other men, aged 26 and 58, are in a hospital with what police describe as non-life threatening injuries.\n\nAshton also said police had searched two Melbourne properties on Saturday in relation to the attack, but that police did not believe there were any ongoing threats to the public. It's the second time in four years Australia has witnessed militant violence.\n\nIn December 2014, a 17-hour siege in which a gunman took 18 people hostage in a Sydney cafe ended with two hostages dead and the assailant killed by police. Though the erratic gunman demanded that police deliver him an Islamic State flag at the outset of the crisis, there was no evidence he had established contact with the militant group. However, at a later inquest, the coroner of New South Wales state said the gunman's actions fell \"within the accepted definition of terrorism.\"\n\nMelbourne was also the scene of two fatal car-ramming incidents last year, but neither was linked by police to terrorism.\n\nAshton said there is no suggestion Shire Ali was inspired by James \"Dimitrious\" Gargasoulas, who faced court this week on six charges of murder over the first ramming attack, in January 2017.", "", "", "", "", "", "bad url", "LOS ANGELES \u2014 The fast-moving \"Woolsey Fire\" ravaging Southern California has scorched the homes of some celebrities and a historic movie site recently used by the HBO series \"Westworld.\" The wildfire forced celebrities to join thousands of others who have fled flames that have claimed homes and forced an evacuation of Malibu.\n\nKim Kardashian West, Scott Baio, Rainn Wilson and Guillermo del Toro are among those who have evacuated their homes.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018\n\nIt was a clear sign that the \"America first\" president was ready to chart his own course yet again as world leaders gathered to remember the coalition that brought an end to the first global war. Mr. Trump's visit comes on the heels of midterm elections in which Americans delivered a split referendum on his presidency, keeping the Senate in his party's control but ceding the House to opposition Democrats.\n\nHe planned to meet with Macron on Saturday for talks on topics expected to include European security, Syria and Iran. As he arrived, Mr. Trump tweeted that Macron \"has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\"\n\nMr. Trump's brief visit to Europe comes amid uncertainty about the U.S. relationship with the continent. Mr. Trump has railed against trade deals with the European Union and has criticized some EU nations, including France, for not spending enough to defense to sustain NATO, the decades-old Western alliance formed as a bulwark to Moscow's aggression.\n\nAt a NATO meeting in July, Mr. Trump similarly railed against the European leaders as he was meeting them, tweeting \"What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy?\" The president's tweet about Germany came after he had what he described as a \"great meeting\" with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nMr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, said Friday in Paris that the U.S. was concerned about stability in Europe and that Mr. Trump was not shirking from global engagement. \"I think the enduring lesson (of World War I) for the United States is that when you become a global power ... you have global interests to protect,\" Bolton said. \"Great world leaders,\" he said, are \"driven by national interests.\"\n\nFor Sunday's armistice anniversary, Mr. Trump was to join world leaders at a ceremony in the shadow of the Arc de Triomphe.\n\n\"It should be a very beautiful period of time, the 100th anniversary of the ending of World War I. We have many countries \u2014 the leadership from many countries will be there, especially since they heard the United States will be there.

Mr. Trump ordered the Pentagon to come up with plans for his own version, but they were eventually scrapped over concerns about costs and the damage tanks weighing many tons would do to the streets in Washington.\n\nMr. Trump and Macron's early relationship was marked by kisses, frequent meetings and marathon power handshakes. Early on, Macron tried to position himself as a sort of \"Trump whisperer\" and Mr. Trump returned the favor, hosting Macron at the first and only state dinner of his presidency.

Patrick, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAt the same time, Macron has increasingly been positioning himself as a bulwark against the rising tide of Trump-style populism across Europe, speaking out loudly against the dangers of nationalism and isolationist retreat.\n\n\"He's starting to become the antithesis of President Trump's public messaging,\" said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nThe president and first lady Melania Trump were expected to visit several memorial sites in France that are dedicated to American service members.

That now seems more likely for later this month, when they attend the Group of 20 summit of international leaders in Argentina.\n\nMr. Trump and Putin have met previously on the sidelines of two summits and had their own bilateral meeting in July in Helsinki.

He was 19 years old.\n\nWord spread across Orange County. Blaze Bernstein, brilliant, kind-hearted, Jewish and gay, had come home from college for the holidays and vanished.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: He wanted to spend time with us. He's not gonna just disappear like that.\n\nTracy Smith: But your thought was?\n\nGideon Bernstein: Well it was just so highly unusual.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: Where had he been? Who had he gone with? We didn't know. Where is he?\n\nGideon Bernstein\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: We had a happy life. We really did. We had good -- many, many good memories.\n\nThe memories and magic that remain began when the baby was born.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: That night I dreamt that his name was Blaze.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: And the first time I saw him, I looked in his eyes. \u2026 Something about this baby, he's gonna change the world someday. In his own way, he did change the world. He already has.\n\nIt was 1998 when Jeanne Pepper Bernstein and Gideon Bernstein welcomed their first of three children, Blaze, into their Orange County, California, home -- an oasis of love and creativity.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: I call him a unicorn \u2026 He was magnificently creative.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: We were best friends when we were very young, yeah.\n\nTracy Smith: What'd you learn about Blaze? What'd you know about him?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: Blaze was always a very kind and caring person. He was always a very cuddly kid.\n\nCuddly and creative, it was no surprise to Raiah Rofsky when Blaze joined her for high school at OCSA -- the Orange County School of the Arts.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: It's very prestigious. \u2026It's known for getting a quality arts education with a quality academic education.\n\nClaire Velau: Blaze was honestly one of the smartest people I've ever met.\n\nAnother classmate, Claire Velau, also knew Blaze was more than brilliant.\n\nClaire Velau: Something that was really unique about Blaze is he always made you feel important \u2026 Like, if you were talking to him, like you knew he was actually listening.\n\nFor Blaze, OCSA was a feast of educational riches.\n\nEric Tryon | OCSA teacher: He was just like a beam of light.\n\nEric Tryon taught his student about writing, which became Blaze's focus.\n\nEric Tyron: He wanted to do the work, which you can't always say for kids that age \u2026 that's a dream student.\n\nAnd then there was another classmate, Sam Woodward.\n\nPhilip Schwadron | OCSA teacher: He was just a very serious guy. He didn't crack jokes. Didn't laugh at jokes.\n\nPhilip Schwadron taught Sam acting.\n\nPhilip Schwadron: He wanted to do a monologue about the military. He wanted to play an Army guy, a general or something.\n\nIn a school that embraced tolerance and diversity, many thought Sam had deeply troubling ideas.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: I have a friend who was in a playwriting class with him, and they were reading \"Raisin in the Sun\" and they all got their individual copies. When everybody gave theirs back, he had had the \"N\" word written all through it.\n\nRacist scrawls in the classic American drama about the struggles of a black family.\n\nTracy Smith: He had a reputation of being what?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: Racist, homophobic, sexist.\n\nBut for Rofsky, one particular incident is impossible to shake.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: He was drawing guns in his notebook in class.\n\nTracy Smith: Did you say anything?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: No.\n\nTracy Smith: But you thought--\n\nRaiah Rofsky: This is terrifying.\n\nTracy Smith: What were people saying about Sam?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: People were saying that they wouldn't be surprised if he came and shot up the school.\n\nTracy Smith: People said that about him?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: Yes. And I felt that too. He's gonna be that kid.\n\nTracy Smith: Did Sam stay at OCSA?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: He left after sophomore year of high school.\n\nTracy Smith: And did you find out why?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: No.\n\nSam Woodward transferred to a more traditional high school. Blaze went on at OCSA, learning more about his world. He had already learned a key thing about himself.\n\nTracy Smith: So you guys were kind of walking down the beach alone together and he came out to you?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nTracy Smith: Did you get the sense that Blaze had told anyone else that he thought he was bi?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: I don't think that he did. He was kind of upset to say it.\n\nTracy Smith: Something that clearly was a big secret for him.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: Yeah, you know coming out to yourself is a really mature, difficult thing to do.\n\nTracy Smith: And what did you tell him?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: I told him, \"It's OK. If you like boys that's totally fine. Love who you love.\"\n\nAnd while he hadn't yet come out to his parents, Gideon and Jeanne sensed Blaze might be gay.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: We went up to him and said, \"Listen, whatever your situation is, we embrace it. We love you. We don't care.\"\n\nGideon Bernstein: \"We love you for whoever you are.\"\n\nIt was late summer 2016 and Blaze, who'd already achieved so much, was headed to an Ivy League School, the University of Pennsylvania. There'd be new friends, mentors and challenges. And Blaze seemed ready for it all.\n\nGrayson Honan | Blaze's friend: I can still remember, like he was wearing this really cool overall outfit the first time I met him [laughs].\n\nTracy Smith: Overalls?\n\nGrayson Honan: Yeah.\n\nTracy Smith: Took some fashion risks it sounds like.\n\nGrayson Honan: Yeah.\n\nAmy Marcus | Blaze's friend: But he didn't care.\n\nNoel Zhang\n\nCollege friends Amy Marcus and Grayson Honan sensed, even by Ivy League standards, Blaze was something special.\n\nAmy Marcus: The track that he was headed down was psychology, and he was really, really excited to do some psychological research, especially into happiness, which I thought was really cool. He was also an incredible writer.\n\nAnd a gourmet chef. He now was also considering a career in medicine.\n\nGrayson Honan: He wanted to help as many people as he could and it was really impressive to see.\n\nDuring Winter break 2017, Blaze came home to Southern California.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: It was a much anticipated visit. He was really looking forward to being with us, too.\n\nThere were holiday celebrations. Then, sometime on the night of Jan. 2, 2018, Blaze left the house.\n\nTracy Smith: So that night, when did you realize that he was missing?\n\nGideon Bernstein: We didn't.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: I didn't know that night.\n\nGideon Bernstein: We didn't even know. We thought he slept in and the next day we were --\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: I had my aha moment when I was at the dental appointment.\n\nThe next day, Blaze was due to meet his mom for a dentist appointment. But Blaze never showed up and wasn't answering his cellphone.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: I called Gideon \u2026 he asked me if Blaze had ever come home the night before. And I screamed out, \"I don't know!\"\n\nGideon Bernstein: That's when I just basically just rushed outta the office and came home.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: We both did. We flew home.\n\nBlaze's parents rushed home and checked his room.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: His wallet. His retainers. His keys.\n\nGideon Bernstein: Those were all still at the house.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: His glasses. Yeah, all of that stuff was at the house.\n\nThey called the police, and then tried to log on to Blaze's social media accounts.\n\nGideon Bernstein: \u2026and then we just jumped on his computer, tried to get into his, you know, files and this was a big challenge for us.\n\nWith the help of family and friends, Jeanne and Gideon got access to Blaze's Snapchat account. That's where they discovered that Blaze had sent his home address to someone: Sam Woodward, Blaze's one-time classmate.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: The only reason I could think of Sam meeting up with Blaze is because either number one, he wanted to hook up with him, or two, because he was planning to murder him.\n\nTHE SEARCH FOR BLAZE\n\nRabbi Arnold Rachlis nurtured Blaze's spirit at Orange County's University Synagogue.\n\nRabbi Arnold Rachlis: \u2026a good heart, a good soul. That's what Blaze had. \u2026within less than a day of Blaze being missing, word spread.\n\nBorrego Park became the center of the search.\n\nLt. Brad Valentine | Orange County Sheriff's Dept. [to reporters]: So it's gonna be a slow, tedious search as they get out there and beat the bushes and look for any signs of him.\n\nEdgy hours turned into anxious days.\n\nGideon Bernstein [to reporters]: We're here today to get your help to find our son.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein [to reporters]: Please keep your eyes open for my baby. I want him home with me. Now.\n\nAll Jeanne and Gideon Bernstein had to go on was that clue they found on Blaze's computer: their home address sent out to a seeming stranger: Sam Woodward.\n\nGideon Bernstein: We never heard the name.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: We never heard the name before.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: It was already terrifying that I found out that Blaze was missing. But it was even more terrifying to find out he was with Sam Woodward.\n\nTracy Smith: Why?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: Because he was literally known as being a crazy, homophobic, racist guy.\n\nSam Woodward, now a college drop-out, was working part-time and living at home.\n\nOrange County cops went to meet him.\n\nSam Woodward couldn't have been more cooperative. He told Blaze's parents and police that he and Blaze came to Borrego Park to hang out. And according to Sam, after awhile Blaze walked down a path alone and disappeared into the brush. The search for Blaze Bernstein heated up.\n\nGideon Bernstein/Facebook\n\nRabbi Arnold Rachlis: We printed up thousands and thousands of fliers that people in the congregation put up on wall boards, coffeehouses, on poles and everything.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: There was a Facebook page, \"Find Blaze Bernstein.\" There were like helicopter searches.\n\nRabbi Arnold Rachlis: The police are looking. Everybody's looking.\n\nNEWS REPORT: The search for Blaze Bernstein went airborne Sunday with more than a dozen drone pilots.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: I really didn't know if we would ever find him --\n\nGideon Bernstein: As the days passed it became more and more difficult.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: And I thought we're never gonna know. We're never going to know what happened exactly. We're never going to figure it out. [Pauses, shakes her head] Yeah. That's what I thought.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: And I just got this gut feeling in my stomach. That I just\u2014I just thought to myself, \"Oh my God.\"\n\nBernstein Family\n\nFrom day one, Blaze's oldest friend had an instinct that chilled.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: I immediately thought, \"He's dead. He's dead.\"\n\nTracy Smith: Just from hearing that he was with Sam?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: Yes.\n\nIt was day seven since Blaze last left home. A family and a community were beyond frustrated. Detectives had searched Borrego Park over and over again. But they decided to give it one more look. In the pouring rain, hidden under a large tree branch was a mound of dirt. Under the wet caked earth lay Blaze Bernstein.\n\nGideon Bernstein [to reporters]: Needless to say our family is devastated by the news. \u2026We, like so many of you around the world, loved Blaze and we wanted nothing more than to seek his safe return.\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas | Orange County: [to reporters] This is a senseless murder of a young man who possessed the combination of a high-caliber mind and the heart of a poet.\n\nTracy Smith: How did Blaze Bernstein die?\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas: He was stabbed multiple times in the neck -- 19 stab wounds in the neck.\n\nTracy Smith: What does that tell you?\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas: Well it tells me that there was a lot of hate.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: All I could think of was just, \"I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.\"\n\nTracy Smith: You knew.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: I knew.\n\nRabbi Arnold Rachlis: Then the funeral happened \u2026 And it was shattering.\n\nThe grief seemed to stretch across Orange County -- neighbors, friends, strangers, teachers.\n\nNeighbor [tying a blue ribbon around a tree]: We're hugging them right now. We're all hugging them. This is our big giant hug to them.\n\nEric Tryon | Teacher: It was devastating to hear. And it's so horrifying to think about what happened.\n\nRabbi Arnold Rachlis: And not stabbed once or twice, but over and over and over again in a crazed angry murderous rage.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: I just try not to think about what that really meant. I don't think that I physically can deal with the trauma of what's happened yet.\n\nREPORTER: Can you tell us what happened to Blaze? SAM WOODWARD: [Grunts] No comment. REPORTER: Were you there when he disappeared? SAM WOODWARD: No comment. [Goes inside house and shuts the door]\n\nDays after Blaze Bernstein's body was found, investigators were ready to take the next step.\n\nKCBS\n\nREPORTER MICHELE GILE | CBS LOS ANGELES: Undercover officers made their move on Sam Woodward this afternoon as he pulled out of his Newport Beach driveway and went down the road. They pulled that car over and arrested him.\n\nD.A. Tony Rackaukas: Sam Woodward was charged with murder with the personal use of a knife.\n\nWoodward pleaded not guilty.\n\nA community -- a school, a synagogue, and a family were in shock.\n\nBut another community \u2013 small, twisted with sick rage -- greeted the news of Blaze Bernstein's brutal murder in a very different way.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: He killed a Jew. Like, was there a party? No, but like did people joke about it? Yeah. Everyone celebrated him.\n\nEveryone in the hate group this man belonged to. They say they are Nazis. And they rejoiced for one of their own, Sam Woodward.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: I never physically met the guy but I knew him online.\n\nFor months, \"48 Hours\" has been trying to learn more about the violent neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen from the inside.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: Like, he killed a gay Jew.\n\nAnd finally, a one-time member agreed to talk. The words are unimaginable, but to understand Atomwaffen we felt it necessary to hear some of the hate.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member [via Skype]: You know, he killed two birds with one stone essentially.\n\nTracy Smith: Which is even better in Atomwaffen's eyes?\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: Yeah, of course.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: It's dangerous. Their ideology is at the core deeply hateful.\n\nJoanna Mendelson has spent close to 20 years monitoring the dark world of extreme hate at the Los Angeles office of the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: It's important that we shine a very bright light on these groups and understand them for what they are. Not to glorify them and not to give them any more notoriety than they already have.\n\nTracy Smith: But at the same time, to be able to recognize what they're doing?\n\nJoanna Mendelson: We have to be able to call them out.\n\nJake Hanrahan | Journalist: Atomwaffen is essentially a extreme, extreme, far-right militant neo-Nazi group in America. And their end goal is \u2026 the destruction of America as a whole.\n\nWHY?\n\nTracy Smith: How would you describe Blaze?\n\nRichard Bernstein: He had a lot of imagination. And very curious.\n\nIt's a truth as timeless as the human family.\n\nLeah Bernstein: We just loved him.\n\nThere is no love like the love of a grandparent for a grandchild. And so it was for Leah and Richard Bernstein, and their grandson Blaze.\n\nCBS News\n\nLeah Bernstein: I feel that he lives in our heart. And every night I have a difficult time going to sleep because I always think of him before I go to sleep.\n\nRichard Bernstein: I think the world lost a beautiful soul.\n\nThe evidence marking the loss of that soul was revealed when the heavens opened up and the rain came down.\n\nLeah Bernstein: If not the rain, we would have never known what happened to him \u2026 The person that murdered him made like a, you know --\n\nRichard Bernstein: Grave.\n\nLeah Bernstein: -- a grave and covered him all with mud, so the rain uncovered his face.\n\nThen, in Borrego Park, where Blaze ended up with one-time classmate Sam Woodward, investigators found Blaze's phone. And in Woodward's car, according to the D.A.:\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas: The blood on the headliner belonged to both Sam Woodward and Blaze Bernstein.\n\nTracy Smith: Blaze Bernstein's blood was in Sam Woodward's car?\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas: Yes. Yes.\n\nTracy Smith: And then they went on to search the house?\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas: Yes.\n\nTracy Smith: What kind of forensic evidence did they gather?\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas: There was a knife \u2026 The knife had blood on it \u2026 Blaze Bernstein's blood on the knife.\n\nGideon Bernstein: [In tears] Just wanna know why.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: I don't -- I don't even wanna know because I'm not gonna like that answer.\n\nBut it's \"the why\" Blaze was murdered that makes an unbearable loss almost unspeakable. And as with those 11 people slaughtered in a Pittsburgh synagogue, transforms the murder of Blaze Bernstein into a national issue.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: It's very alarming that this is happening \u2026 This is atrocious hate. It's just right there.\n\nJake Hanrahan: Sam Woodward was \u2026 absolutely, definitely \u2026 a member of Atomwaffen Division.\n\n\"48 Hours\" spoke via Skype with British journalist and CBS News consultant Jake Hanrahan. For Hanrahan, the arrest of Woodward brought an awful confirmation: Atomwaffen was right at home glorifying an accused killer.\n\nJake Hanrahan: Oh yeah. Absolutely. They made T-shirts using Sam Woodward's mug shot.\n\nHanrahan had been reporting on Atomwaffen for nearly two years. They weren't all that hard to find. Hanrahan obtained their secret chat logs and first made note of an angry college dropout, Sam Woodward.\n\nJake Hanrahan: Doing like Nazi salutes next to other members of Atomwaffen.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: I joined Atomwaffen in 2016\n\nTracy Smith: Did you consider yourself a neo-Nazi?\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: I just considered myself a Nazi.\n\nThe man Hanrahan introduced \"48 Hours\" to wouldn't tell us his name or dare to show his face. He claims to have been a member of Atomwaffen for more than a year.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: I joined Atomwaffen because of the militancy and the brotherhood that they offered\n\n\n\nTracy Smith: Brotherhood.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: Yeah. It was like a camaraderie type of feeling \u2026 common interests.\n\nTracy Smith: And those interests were hating other groups, hating Jews, hating gays, hating blacks?\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: Yeah. Oh yeah.\n\nJoanna Mendelson | Anti-Defamation League: This is some of the most intense and some of the most extreme rhetoric that I've seen in a long time.\n\nAtomwaffen began in Florida in 2015. The group believes that the so-called alt-right that converged at the violent 2017 demonstration in Charlottesville doesn't go nearly far enough.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: They don't even like to be associated with the alt right at all. They hate the Alt Right.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: Their rhetoric and their ideology is white supremacy on steroids \u2026 In fact, the name of Atomwaffen translates in German to atomic weapon.\n\nTracy Smith: We'll just obliterate you.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: We'll wipe you out.\n\nAccording to investigators, Sam Woodward, a privileged upper middle class kid from Southern California, was drawn to this ideology -- drawn to Atomwaffen's heroes: Adolf Hitler, Charles Manson, Timothy McVeigh and James Mason, author of Atomwaffen's favorite neo-Nazi publication, \"Siege.\" Woodward went to meet him.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: Did I think that like, this guy was going to do something like this? Honestly, I wasn't surprised.\n\nAnd by 2017, Sam Woodward, at times sporting his absurd Atomwaffen mask, attended their version of a corporate retreat.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: Hate camps have occurred across the country, involving Atomwaffen members.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: They talk about cutting telephone wires and power grids. And shutting down the system. A system that they detest.\n\nThe images and ambitions are surreal, but their hatred could not be more real.\n\nJake Hanrahan: They want to kill, obviously, first and foremost Jews. They want to kill gays.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: There were people congratulating this accused killer, for what he has done, killing my son. Congratulating him.\n\nJake Hanrahan: They call him the gay, the one-man gay, Jew wrecking ball. You know, like kind of reveling in this idea that he's killed this gay, Jewish kid.\n\nNazi \"wannabes\" laughing at the murder of Blaze in Orange County.\n\nTracy Smith: \"LOL OC.\"\n\nJoanna Mendelson: \"LOL OC.\" Laughing at the fact that Blaze Bernstein's life was extinguished.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: Everyone in Atomwaffen believes Jewish people just need to be wiped off the face of the earth.\n\nRabbi Arnold Rachlis : As the story unfolded that the murder was related to homophobia and anti-Semitism, well then the anger in the community and the anxiety ratcheted up.\n\nTracy Smith: Do you think that Blaze was murdered because he was gay, and because he was Jewish?\n\nRaiah Rofksy:Yes, 100 percent.\n\nRabbi Arnold Rachlis: Permission has been granted for the ugliest kind of racism, anti-Semitism, immigrant bashing and hatred.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: We used to monitor these groups that lurked in the shadows. But today they are emerging front and center.\n\nTracy Smith: Had you ever heard of Atomwaffen before this?\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: No. But we should have. Because we're a perfect target for that group.\n\nA perfect target for today's Nazi, just as Blaze's grandma Leah, a Holocaust survivor, was so many years ago. A little Jewish girl forced by Hitler's Nazis to wear a yellow star.\n\nLeah Bernstein: Yes. We did wear the stars.\n\nTracy Smith: You all had to wear the stars. You've seen a lot.\n\nLeah Bernstein: Quite a bit.\n\nTracy Smith: It's a horrible irony, that what you escaped is.\n\nLeah Bernstein: Is following me. Yeah.\n\nTHE TENTACLES OF HATE\n\nClear across the country from where Sam Woodward morphed into an Atomwaffen Nazi, Nick Giampa grew up with his own set of insecurities and issues that eventually led him to find Atomwaffen's online propaganda.\n\nEmily: By the time he was in second grade Nicholas wasn't your ordinary little boy.\n\nNick's sister Emily and her husband Chris stuck by Nick. They say he was bipolar and suffered from other psychological issues.\n\nChris: He was in one school in the second grade, another school in the third grade, another school in the fourth grade. I think it was eight or nine different schools.\n\nEmily: Nicholas was bullied, called a freak, called a retard, stupid, dumb.\n\nEmily: He thought he was invisible. He said, \"Nobody ever sees me. Nobody ever calls my phone. \u2026He was a lonely child on the internet.\n\nFacebook\n\nA perfect profile to be vulnerable to the postings of a hate group. Still, in his junior year of high school, Nick's life changed in a positive way.\n\nEmily: It was such a self confidence boost, like \"Wow, I found someone that loves me.\"\n\nChris: Everything in the world was going good for him.\n\nNick had his first-ever girlfriend, a classmate. \"48 Hours\" agreed not to show her face. She was the 16-year-old daughter of a Reston, Virginia, couple -- Scott Fricker and his wife Buckley Kuhn Fricker.\n\nDeb Merriner: She was always learning, always wanting to see if she could figure out how to serve people better.\n\nBuckley Kuhn Fricker was a lawyer-turned-advocate for the elderly. Deb Merriner was her assistant.\n\nFacebook\n\nDeb Merriner: They were amazing parents. \u2026I was blown away by the dedication to making sure their kids were raised right.\n\nJustin Jouvenal | Washington Post crime reporter: It was three days before Christmas.\n\n911 CALL: Caller is still upstairs with her boyfriend. Shots fired.\n\nJustin Jouvenal: And I got a call from the office very early in the morning, saying that there had been this horrific double murder in a fairly upscale neighborhood just outside of D.C.\n\nWashington Post crime reporter Justin Jouvenal would learn about the rich family values of Scott and Buckley and the bankrupt ideology of Atomwaffen.\n\nJustin Jouvenal: So I jumped in my car early that morning and made my way out to the neighborhood and began reporting on what happened.\n\nAccording to Nick Giampa's own family, just hours earlier, Nick grabbed a gun from his home, and drove to the Fricker's home.\n\nA house decked out for the holidays.\n\nJustin Jouvenal: There was yellow crime tape up around the house \u2026 There were snowflakes on the house. Christmas wreathes. \u2026Detectives going in and out, crime scene investigators.\n\nBuckley and Scott Fricker had been shot to death in their own home, likely in front of their 16-year-old daughter -- Nick Giampa's first girlfriend.\n\nJustin Jouvenal: It was absolutely horrific\n\nThe daughter was not shot. But Nick Giampa was in the house, still alive after allegedly shooting himself through the skull. A trail of blood led to Atomwaffen.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: Nick Giampa allegedly killed his girlfriend's parents because they found out about his white supremacist beliefs.\n\nTracy Smith: And they told her not to date him anymore?\n\nJoanna Mendelson: They forbade their daughter from dating him.\n\nJustin Jouvenal: The daughter agreed to stop seeing her boyfriend. \u2026This set him off.\n\nBuckley, a concerned and involved mom, had confronted her daughter after discovering Nick's retweets of Atomwaffen on her daughter's phone. The teenage girl had nothing to do with Atomwaffen, but Nick was sharing their racist posts.\n\nJustin Jouvenal: Very slick propaganda, which they've pushed out via social media, that's been picked up by people who are, you know perhaps, vulnerable.\n\nEmily: It was a way for Nicholas to be the bully for once.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: If you're looking at their propaganda \u2026 they're seeking to attract ostracized youth and outcast youth. Especially \u2026 white kids that are just bullied.\n\nChris: That was just him trying to get a rise outta people on the internet \u2026 And that's what he did.\n\nThe boy who once felt invisible, had found a horrendous way to get the world's attention.\n\nChris: Nicholas was not part of any Atomwaffen group. He was never part of that.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: He was an initiate in the Virginia chapter \u2026 You can't say Nick was a member of AW But you can say Nick was an initiate in AW.\n\nChris: I don't think he would ever be part of any Atomwaffen group. This was my little brother.\n\nBut just as they did when Blaze Bernstein was murdered, Atomwaffen's small membership of Nazi wannabes mocked a murder -- this time the unconscionable killing of Scott and Buckley Kuhn Fricker.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: Yeah. They made Nick Giampa propaganda.\n\nJustin Jouvenal: They sent out a tweet with his picture superimposed on a Kalashnikov.\n\nSam Woodward allegedly embraced Atomwaffen. Nick Giampa was infected by far more casual contact. But in each case, the Nazi cancer proved deadly.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: They reaffirm hate, they desensitize the viewer, and they create a sense of normalcy.\n\nTracy Smith: That this is OK.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: This is acceptable.\n\nTracy Smith: Do you think if Buckley and Scott hadn't found those Nazi images on their daughter's phone, would they still be alive today?\n\nJake Hanrahan: [Sighs] Probably.\n\nFIGHTING HATE WITH LOVE\n\nDetectives say Sam Woodward went online trolling gay men, pretending he was interested in a sexual hookup. But the D.A. believes it wasn't a hookup Sam had in mind with Blaze Bernstein; it was a setup for murder.\n\nTracy Smith: Does it seem like Sam is sexually conflicted himself?\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas | Orange County: He doesn't claim to be sexually conflicted. He claims to be somebody who hates gays and wants to cause harm to them.\n\nJake Hanrahan: In fact on his Tinder he said, \"I'm going hunting.\" \u2026The kid was planning to kill someone because of his ideology.\n\nOn Aug. 2, 2018, the Orange County D.A. added an enhancement to the charges against Sam Woodward in the murder of Blaze Bernstein. From Blaze's family to his friends, no one was surprised by the D.A.'s decision:\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas [to reporters]: This increases the maximum penalty to life without the possibility of parole. We will prove that Woodward killed Blaze because Blaze was gay.\n\nAfter police seized physical evidence, including an Atomwaffen mask in Woodward's car, they found a trove of Nazi hate on his phone and computer.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: They found evidence of Sam being involved in Atomwaffen.\n\nBlaze's murder was now considered a hate crime.\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas: Sam Woodward is a hater. \u2026He hates homosexuals. He hates people who are Jewish. He hates people of all different kinds of categories who are not white.\n\nFor Gideon and Jeanne Bernstein, it deepened the darkest tragedy.\n\nGideon Bernstein [to reporters]: Today we suffer an added layer of pain from learning that he was likely killed simply because of who he was as a human being.\n\nFor Blaze's oldest friend Raiah Rofsky, who is Jewish and identifies as bisexual, it brings an unsettling fear.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: I have to be careful and I'm terrified.\n\nTracy Smith: You truly feel unsafe.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: I do.\n\nRabbi Arnold Rachlis: There has to be zero tolerance of homophobia, zero tolerance of racism, of anti-Semitism, of immigrant bashing.\n\nFor Blaze's grandma Leah, who wore that yellow Nazi star, sadness and belief blend into one.\n\nLeah Bernstein: It's very painful. It's very, very hard.\n\nTracy Smith: After seeing all this, are you hopeful?\n\nLeah Bernstein: I'm very hopeful. Because there are lots of good people in the world.\n\nAnd at least one new way to fight hate with love.\n\nLeah Bernstein: Well, we BlazeItForward.\n\nCBS News\n\nBlazeItForward. Just days after they learned of their son's death, the Bernsteins made the remarkable decision to channel their grief into kindness.\n\nGideon Bernstein: Let's do something where we go onto this, you know, BlazeItForward Facebook page and tell people to give money to some charity.\n\nGideon and Jeanne targeted foster care kids and at-risk youth.\n\nThey raised money for a scholarship at OSCA, the high school where Blaze shined so bright.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein [at scholarship event]: We are delighted to award two scholarships this year from the Blaze Bernstein memorial endowment scholarship.\n\nThousands of friends and strangers gathered to honor Blaze.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: I want to do my piece to repair the world in Blaze's honor and to promote his legacy.\n\nAs they embraced each other, their community \"Blazed it\" right back.\n\nPride Parade Organizer [addressing parade goers]: This parade is rededicated as our community's official Blaze Forward OC LGBT Pride Parade\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein [addressing parade goers]: We thank you for giving us this honor. For honoring my son and his memory and for Blazing It Forward.\n\nBlazeItForward. It's much more than a slogan. It is now a calling, a new way of life for Jeanne and Gideon Bernstein. At its heart is finding some sort of silver lining in an unspeakable tragedy. And at Orange County's Pride Day, the spirit of BlazeItForward is everywhere. It's a promise made to a young man targeted by hate, now inspiring love.\n\nAnd perhaps steering one hater away from the poison that is Atomwaffen.\n\nTracy Smith: Do you feel like you owe Blaze Bernstein's family an apology?\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: Yes, I do.\n\nAnd if he is to be believed, because of the murder of Blaze Bernstein he says he's no longer a Nazi and has quit Atomwaffen.\n\nTracy Smith: You could say something now.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: To them?\n\nTracy Smith: Sure.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: Yeah, so, I'm so sorry that -- I'm so sorry that this happened to your son \u2026 I would like to see AW brought down. I would like to see Sam put behind bars for life.\n\nBernstein family\n\nIn Borrego Park, where Blaze Bernstein's light was extinguished, people from around the world leave stones in his memory.\n\nLeah Bernstein: It's beautiful.\n\nRichard Bernstein: You see all the stones, you feel the love.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: I think that sometimes I dream. I can't control that. And I dream. And I wake up. And it [sighs] just haunts me. Those dreams can haunt me for days.\n\nTracy Smith: Dreams about?\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: About my son. Just him, alive.\n\nSam Woodward and his defense would not speak to \"48 Hours.\" Woodward's murder trial is expected in 2019.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2017 there was a 57 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents in America.", "Produced by Jaime Stolz and Gayane Keshishyan Mendez\n\n\"Not again.\" Yes again. \"Not again.\"\n\nThis week in Thousand Oaks, California, a madman's bullets left at least a dozen dead. In America this has become a devastating ritual.\n\nTwo weeks ago it was Pittsburgh. Before that Parkland, Charleston and Las Vegas. Some victims, linked by faith or the color of their skin. Others, simply in the wrong place at the worst possible time.\n\n\"48 Hours\" correspondent Tracy Smith has the story about one young man targeted by hate.\n\nMeet Blaze Bernstein. He was 19 years old.\n\nWord spread across Orange County. Blaze Bernstein, brilliant, kind-hearted, Jewish and gay, had come home from college for the holidays and vanished.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: He wanted to spend time with us. He's not gonna just disappear like that.\n\nTracy Smith: But your thought was?\n\nGideon Bernstein: Well it was just so highly unusual.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: Where had he been? Who had he gone with? We didn't know. Where is he?\n\nGideon Bernstein\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: We had a happy life. We really did. We had good -- many, many good memories.\n\nThe memories and magic that remain began when the baby was born.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: That night I dreamt that his name was Blaze.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: And the first time I saw him, I looked in his eyes. \u2026 Something about this baby, he's gonna change the world someday. In his own way, he did change the world. He already has.\n\nIt was 1998 when Jeanne Pepper Bernstein and Gideon Bernstein welcomed their first of three children, Blaze, into their Orange County, California, home -- an oasis of love and creativity.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: I call him a unicorn \u2026 He was magnificently creative.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: We were best friends when we were very young, yeah.\n\nTracy Smith: What'd you learn about Blaze? What'd you know about him?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: Blaze was always a very kind and caring person. He was always a very cuddly kid.\n\nCuddly and creative, it was no surprise to Raiah Rofsky when Blaze joined her for high school at OCSA -- the Orange County School of the Arts.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: It's very prestigious. \u2026It's known for getting a quality arts education with a quality academic education.\n\nClaire Velau: Blaze was honestly one of the smartest people I've ever met.\n\nAnother classmate, Claire Velau, also knew Blaze was more than brilliant.\n\nClaire Velau: Something that was really unique about Blaze is he always made you feel important \u2026 Like, if you were talking to him, like you knew he was actually listening.\n\nFor Blaze, OCSA was a feast of educational riches.\n\nEric Tryon | OCSA teacher: He was just like a beam of light.\n\nEric Tryon taught his student about writing, which became Blaze's focus.\n\nEric Tyron: He wanted to do the work, which you can't always say for kids that age \u2026 that's a dream student.\n\nAnd then there was another classmate, Sam Woodward.\n\nPhilip Schwadron | OCSA teacher: He was just a very serious guy. He didn't crack jokes. Didn't laugh at jokes.\n\nPhilip Schwadron taught Sam acting.\n\nPhilip Schwadron: He wanted to do a monologue about the military. He wanted to play an Army guy, a general or something.\n\nIn a school that embraced tolerance and diversity, many thought Sam had deeply troubling ideas.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: I have a friend who was in a playwriting class with him, and they were reading \"Raisin in the Sun\" and they all got their individual copies. When everybody gave theirs back, he had had the \"N\" word written all through it.\n\nRacist scrawls in the classic American drama about the struggles of a black family.\n\nTracy Smith: He had a reputation of being what?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: Racist, homophobic, sexist.\n\nBut for Rofsky, one particular incident is impossible to shake.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: He was drawing guns in his notebook in class.\n\nTracy Smith: Did you say anything?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: No.\n\nTracy Smith: But you thought--\n\nRaiah Rofsky: This is terrifying.\n\nTracy Smith: What were people saying about Sam?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: People were saying that they wouldn't be surprised if he came and shot up the school.\n\nTracy Smith: People said that about him?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: Yes. And I felt that too. He's gonna be that kid.\n\nTracy Smith: Did Sam stay at OCSA?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: He left after sophomore year of high school.\n\nTracy Smith: And did you find out why?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: No.\n\nSam Woodward transferred to a more traditional high school. Blaze went on at OCSA, learning more about his world. He had already learned a key thing about himself.\n\nTracy Smith: So you guys were kind of walking down the beach alone together and he came out to you?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nTracy Smith: Did you get the sense that Blaze had told anyone else that he thought he was bi?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: I don't think that he did. He was kind of upset to say it.\n\nTracy Smith: Something that clearly was a big secret for him.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: Yeah, you know coming out to yourself is a really mature, difficult thing to do.\n\nTracy Smith: And what did you tell him?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: I told him, \"It's OK. If you like boys that's totally fine. Love who you love.\"\n\nAnd while he hadn't yet come out to his parents, Gideon and Jeanne sensed Blaze might be gay.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: We went up to him and said, \"Listen, whatever your situation is, we embrace it. We love you. We don't care.\"\n\nGideon Bernstein: \"We love you for whoever you are.\"\n\nIt was late summer 2016 and Blaze, who'd already achieved so much, was headed to an Ivy League School, the University of Pennsylvania. There'd be new friends, mentors and challenges. And Blaze seemed ready for it all.\n\nGrayson Honan | Blaze's friend: I can still remember, like he was wearing this really cool overall outfit the first time I met him [laughs].\n\nTracy Smith: Overalls?\n\nGrayson Honan: Yeah.\n\nTracy Smith: Took some fashion risks it sounds like.\n\nGrayson Honan: Yeah.\n\nAmy Marcus | Blaze's friend: But he didn't care.\n\nNoel Zhang\n\nCollege friends Amy Marcus and Grayson Honan sensed, even by Ivy League standards, Blaze was something special.\n\nAmy Marcus: The track that he was headed down was psychology, and he was really, really excited to do some psychological research, especially into happiness, which I thought was really cool. He was also an incredible writer.\n\nAnd a gourmet chef. He now was also considering a career in medicine.\n\nGrayson Honan: He wanted to help as many people as he could and it was really impressive to see.\n\nDuring Winter break 2017, Blaze came home to Southern California.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: It was a much anticipated visit. He was really looking forward to being with us, too.\n\nThere were holiday celebrations. Then, sometime on the night of Jan. 2, 2018, Blaze left the house.\n\nTracy Smith: So that night, when did you realize that he was missing?\n\nGideon Bernstein: We didn't.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: I didn't know that night.\n\nGideon Bernstein: We didn't even know. We thought he slept in and the next day we were --\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: I had my aha moment when I was at the dental appointment.\n\nThe next day, Blaze was due to meet his mom for a dentist appointment. But Blaze never showed up and wasn't answering his cellphone.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: I called Gideon \u2026 he asked me if Blaze had ever come home the night before. And I screamed out, \"I don't know!\"\n\nGideon Bernstein: That's when I just basically just rushed outta the office and came home.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: We both did. We flew home.\n\nBlaze's parents rushed home and checked his room.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: His wallet. His retainers. His keys.\n\nGideon Bernstein: Those were all still at the house.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: His glasses. Yeah, all of that stuff was at the house.\n\nThey called the police, and then tried to log on to Blaze's social media accounts.\n\nGideon Bernstein: \u2026and then we just jumped on his computer, tried to get into his, you know, files and this was a big challenge for us.\n\nWith the help of family and friends, Jeanne and Gideon got access to Blaze's Snapchat account. That's where they discovered that Blaze had sent his home address to someone: Sam Woodward, Blaze's one-time classmate.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: The only reason I could think of Sam meeting up with Blaze is because either number one, he wanted to hook up with him, or two, because he was planning to murder him.\n\nTHE SEARCH FOR BLAZE\n\nRabbi Arnold Rachlis nurtured Blaze's spirit at Orange County's University Synagogue.\n\nRabbi Arnold Rachlis: \u2026a good heart, a good soul. That's what Blaze had. \u2026within less than a day of Blaze being missing, word spread.\n\nBorrego Park became the center of the search.\n\nLt. Brad Valentine | Orange County Sheriff's Dept. [to reporters]: So it's gonna be a slow, tedious search as they get out there and beat the bushes and look for any signs of him.\n\nEdgy hours turned into anxious days.\n\nGideon Bernstein [to reporters]: We're here today to get your help to find our son.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein [to reporters]: Please keep your eyes open for my baby. I want him home with me. Now.\n\nAll Jeanne and Gideon Bernstein had to go on was that clue they found on Blaze's computer: their home address sent out to a seeming stranger: Sam Woodward.\n\nGideon Bernstein: We never heard the name.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: We never heard the name before.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: It was already terrifying that I found out that Blaze was missing. But it was even more terrifying to find out he was with Sam Woodward.\n\nTracy Smith: Why?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: Because he was literally known as being a crazy, homophobic, racist guy.\n\nSam Woodward, now a college drop-out, was working part-time and living at home.\n\nOrange County cops went to meet him.\n\nSam Woodward couldn't have been more cooperative. He told Blaze's parents and police that he and Blaze came to Borrego Park to hang out. And according to Sam, after awhile Blaze walked down a path alone and disappeared into the brush. The search for Blaze Bernstein heated up.\n\nGideon Bernstein/Facebook\n\nRabbi Arnold Rachlis: We printed up thousands and thousands of fliers that people in the congregation put up on wall boards, coffeehouses, on poles and everything.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: There was a Facebook page, \"Find Blaze Bernstein.\" There were like helicopter searches.\n\nRabbi Arnold Rachlis: The police are looking. Everybody's looking.\n\nNEWS REPORT: The search for Blaze Bernstein went airborne Sunday with more than a dozen drone pilots.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: I really didn't know if we would ever find him --\n\nGideon Bernstein: As the days passed it became more and more difficult.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: And I thought we're never gonna know. We're never going to know what happened exactly. We're never going to figure it out. [Pauses, shakes her head] Yeah. That's what I thought.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: And I just got this gut feeling in my stomach. That I just\u2014I just thought to myself, \"Oh my God.\"\n\nBernstein Family\n\nFrom day one, Blaze's oldest friend had an instinct that chilled.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: I immediately thought, \"He's dead. He's dead.\"\n\nTracy Smith: Just from hearing that he was with Sam?\n\nRaiah Rofsky: Yes.\n\nIt was day seven since Blaze last left home. A family and a community were beyond frustrated. Detectives had searched Borrego Park over and over again. But they decided to give it one more look. In the pouring rain, hidden under a large tree branch was a mound of dirt. Under the wet caked earth lay Blaze Bernstein.\n\nGideon Bernstein [to reporters]: Needless to say our family is devastated by the news. \u2026We, like so many of you around the world, loved Blaze and we wanted nothing more than to seek his safe return.\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas | Orange County: [to reporters] This is a senseless murder of a young man who possessed the combination of a high-caliber mind and the heart of a poet.\n\nTracy Smith: How did Blaze Bernstein die?\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas: He was stabbed multiple times in the neck -- 19 stab wounds in the neck.\n\nTracy Smith: What does that tell you?\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas: Well it tells me that there was a lot of hate.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: All I could think of was just, \"I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.\"\n\nTracy Smith: You knew.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: I knew.\n\nRabbi Arnold Rachlis: Then the funeral happened \u2026 And it was shattering.\n\nThe grief seemed to stretch across Orange County -- neighbors, friends, strangers, teachers.\n\nNeighbor [tying a blue ribbon around a tree]: We're hugging them right now. We're all hugging them. This is our big giant hug to them.\n\nEric Tryon | Teacher: It was devastating to hear. And it's so horrifying to think about what happened.\n\nRabbi Arnold Rachlis: And not stabbed once or twice, but over and over and over again in a crazed angry murderous rage.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: I just try not to think about what that really meant. I don't think that I physically can deal with the trauma of what's happened yet.\n\nREPORTER: Can you tell us what happened to Blaze? SAM WOODWARD: [Grunts] No comment. REPORTER: Were you there when he disappeared? SAM WOODWARD: No comment. [Goes inside house and shuts the door]\n\nDays after Blaze Bernstein's body was found, investigators were ready to take the next step.\n\nKCBS\n\nREPORTER MICHELE GILE | CBS LOS ANGELES: Undercover officers made their move on Sam Woodward this afternoon as he pulled out of his Newport Beach driveway and went down the road. They pulled that car over and arrested him.\n\nD.A. Tony Rackaukas: Sam Woodward was charged with murder with the personal use of a knife.\n\nWoodward pleaded not guilty.\n\nA community -- a school, a synagogue, and a family were in shock.\n\nBut another community \u2013 small, twisted with sick rage -- greeted the news of Blaze Bernstein's brutal murder in a very different way.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: He killed a Jew. Like, was there a party? No, but like did people joke about it? Yeah. Everyone celebrated him.\n\nEveryone in the hate group this man belonged to. They say they are Nazis. And they rejoiced for one of their own, Sam Woodward.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: I never physically met the guy but I knew him online.\n\nFor months, \"48 Hours\" has been trying to learn more about the violent neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen from the inside.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: Like, he killed a gay Jew.\n\nAnd finally, a one-time member agreed to talk. The words are unimaginable, but to understand Atomwaffen we felt it necessary to hear some of the hate.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member [via Skype]: You know, he killed two birds with one stone essentially.\n\nTracy Smith: Which is even better in Atomwaffen's eyes?\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: Yeah, of course.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: It's dangerous. Their ideology is at the core deeply hateful.\n\nJoanna Mendelson has spent close to 20 years monitoring the dark world of extreme hate at the Los Angeles office of the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: It's important that we shine a very bright light on these groups and understand them for what they are. Not to glorify them and not to give them any more notoriety than they already have.\n\nTracy Smith: But at the same time, to be able to recognize what they're doing?\n\nJoanna Mendelson: We have to be able to call them out.\n\nJake Hanrahan | Journalist: Atomwaffen is essentially a extreme, extreme, far-right militant neo-Nazi group in America. And their end goal is \u2026 the destruction of America as a whole.\n\nWHY?\n\nTracy Smith: How would you describe Blaze?\n\nRichard Bernstein: He had a lot of imagination. And very curious.\n\nIt's a truth as timeless as the human family.\n\nLeah Bernstein: We just loved him.\n\nThere is no love like the love of a grandparent for a grandchild. And so it was for Leah and Richard Bernstein, and their grandson Blaze.\n\nCBS News\n\nLeah Bernstein: I feel that he lives in our heart. And every night I have a difficult time going to sleep because I always think of him before I go to sleep.\n\nRichard Bernstein: I think the world lost a beautiful soul.\n\nThe evidence marking the loss of that soul was revealed when the heavens opened up and the rain came down.\n\nLeah Bernstein: If not the rain, we would have never known what happened to him \u2026 The person that murdered him made like a, you know --\n\nRichard Bernstein: Grave.\n\nLeah Bernstein: -- a grave and covered him all with mud, so the rain uncovered his face.\n\nThen, in Borrego Park, where Blaze ended up with one-time classmate Sam Woodward, investigators found Blaze's phone. And in Woodward's car, according to the D.A.:\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas: The blood on the headliner belonged to both Sam Woodward and Blaze Bernstein.\n\nTracy Smith: Blaze Bernstein's blood was in Sam Woodward's car?\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas: Yes. Yes.\n\nTracy Smith: And then they went on to search the house?\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas: Yes.\n\nTracy Smith: What kind of forensic evidence did they gather?\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas: There was a knife \u2026 The knife had blood on it \u2026 Blaze Bernstein's blood on the knife.\n\nGideon Bernstein: [In tears] Just wanna know why.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: I don't -- I don't even wanna know because I'm not gonna like that answer.\n\nBut it's \"the why\" Blaze was murdered that makes an unbearable loss almost unspeakable. And as with those 11 people slaughtered in a Pittsburgh synagogue, transforms the murder of Blaze Bernstein into a national issue.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: It's very alarming that this is happening \u2026 This is atrocious hate. It's just right there.\n\nJake Hanrahan: Sam Woodward was \u2026 absolutely, definitely \u2026 a member of Atomwaffen Division.\n\n\"48 Hours\" spoke via Skype with British journalist and CBS News consultant Jake Hanrahan. For Hanrahan, the arrest of Woodward brought an awful confirmation: Atomwaffen was right at home glorifying an accused killer.\n\nJake Hanrahan: Oh yeah. Absolutely. They made T-shirts using Sam Woodward's mug shot.\n\nHanrahan had been reporting on Atomwaffen for nearly two years. They weren't all that hard to find. Hanrahan obtained their secret chat logs and first made note of an angry college dropout, Sam Woodward.\n\nJake Hanrahan: Doing like Nazi salutes next to other members of Atomwaffen.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: I joined Atomwaffen in 2016\n\nTracy Smith: Did you consider yourself a neo-Nazi?\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: I just considered myself a Nazi.\n\nThe man Hanrahan introduced \"48 Hours\" to wouldn't tell us his name or dare to show his face. He claims to have been a member of Atomwaffen for more than a year.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: I joined Atomwaffen because of the militancy and the brotherhood that they offered\n\n\n\nTracy Smith: Brotherhood.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: Yeah. It was like a camaraderie type of feeling \u2026 common interests.\n\nTracy Smith: And those interests were hating other groups, hating Jews, hating gays, hating blacks?\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: Yeah. Oh yeah.\n\nJoanna Mendelson | Anti-Defamation League: This is some of the most intense and some of the most extreme rhetoric that I've seen in a long time.\n\nAtomwaffen began in Florida in 2015. The group believes that the so-called alt-right that converged at the violent 2017 demonstration in Charlottesville doesn't go nearly far enough.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: They don't even like to be associated with the alt right at all. They hate the Alt Right.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: Their rhetoric and their ideology is white supremacy on steroids \u2026 In fact, the name of Atomwaffen translates in German to atomic weapon.\n\nTracy Smith: We'll just obliterate you.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: We'll wipe you out.\n\nAccording to investigators, Sam Woodward, a privileged upper middle class kid from Southern California, was drawn to this ideology -- drawn to Atomwaffen's heroes: Adolf Hitler, Charles Manson, Timothy McVeigh and James Mason, author of Atomwaffen's favorite neo-Nazi publication, \"Siege.\" Woodward went to meet him.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: Did I think that like, this guy was going to do something like this? Honestly, I wasn't surprised.\n\nAnd by 2017, Sam Woodward, at times sporting his absurd Atomwaffen mask, attended their version of a corporate retreat.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: Hate camps have occurred across the country, involving Atomwaffen members.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: They talk about cutting telephone wires and power grids. And shutting down the system.

They want to kill gays.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: There were people congratulating this accused killer, for what he has done, killing my son. Congratulating him.\n\nJake Hanrahan: They call him the gay, the one-man gay, Jew wrecking ball.

But today they are emerging front and center.\n\nTracy Smith: Had you ever heard of Atomwaffen before this?\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: No. But we should have. Because we're a perfect target for that group.\n\nA perfect target for today's Nazi, just as Blaze's grandma Leah, a Holocaust survivor, was so many years ago.

Yeah.\n\nTHE TENTACLES OF HATE\n\nClear across the country from where Sam Woodward morphed into an Atomwaffen Nazi, Nick Giampa grew up with his own set of insecurities and issues that eventually led him to find Atomwaffen's online propaganda.\n\nEmily: By the time he was in second grade Nicholas wasn't your ordinary little boy.\n\nNick's sister Emily and her husband Chris stuck by Nick. They say he was bipolar and suffered from other psychological issues.\n\nChris: He was in one school in the second grade, another school in the third grade, another school in the fourth grade. I think it was eight or nine different schools.\n\nEmily: Nicholas was bullied, called a freak, called a retard, stupid, dumb.\n\nEmily: He thought he was invisible. He said, \"Nobody ever sees me. Nobody ever calls my phone. \u2026He was a lonely child on the internet.\n\nFacebook\n\nA perfect profile to be vulnerable to the postings of a hate group. Still, in his junior year of high school, Nick's life changed in a positive way.\n\nEmily: It was such a self confidence boost, like \"Wow, I found someone that loves me.\"\n\nChris: Everything in the world was going good for him.\n\nNick had his first-ever girlfriend, a classmate. \"48 Hours\" agreed not to show her face. She was the 16-year-old daughter of a Reston, Virginia, couple -- Scott Fricker and his wife Buckley Kuhn Fricker.\n\nDeb Merriner: She was always learning, always wanting to see if she could figure out how to serve people better.\n\nBuckley Kuhn Fricker was a lawyer-turned-advocate for the elderly. Deb Merriner was her assistant.\n\nFacebook\n\nDeb Merriner: They were amazing parents. \u2026I was blown away by the dedication to making sure their kids were raised right.\n\nJustin Jouvenal | Washington Post crime reporter: It was three days before Christmas.\n\n911 CALL: Caller is still upstairs with her boyfriend. Shots fired.\n\nJustin Jouvenal: And I got a call from the office very early in the morning, saying that there had been this horrific double murder in a fairly upscale neighborhood just outside of D.C.\n\nWashington Post crime reporter Justin Jouvenal would learn about the rich family values of Scott and Buckley and the bankrupt ideology of Atomwaffen.\n\nJustin Jouvenal: So I jumped in my car early that morning and made my way out to the neighborhood and began reporting on what happened.\n\nAccording to Nick Giampa's own family, just hours earlier, Nick grabbed a gun from his home, and drove to the Fricker's home.\n\nA house decked out for the holidays.\n\nJustin Jouvenal: There was yellow crime tape up around the house \u2026 There were snowflakes on the house. Christmas wreathes. \u2026Detectives going in and out, crime scene investigators.\n\nBuckley and Scott Fricker had been shot to death in their own home, likely in front of their 16-year-old daughter -- Nick Giampa's first girlfriend.\n\nJustin Jouvenal: It was absolutely horrific\n\nThe daughter was not shot. But Nick Giampa was in the house, still alive after allegedly shooting himself through the skull. A trail of blood led to Atomwaffen.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: Nick Giampa allegedly killed his girlfriend's parents because they found out about his white supremacist beliefs.\n\nTracy Smith: And they told her not to date him anymore?\n\nJoanna Mendelson: They forbade their daughter from dating him.\n\nJustin Jouvenal: The daughter agreed to stop seeing her boyfriend. \u2026This set him off.\n\nBuckley, a concerned and involved mom, had confronted her daughter after discovering Nick's retweets of Atomwaffen on her daughter's phone. The teenage girl had nothing to do with Atomwaffen, but Nick was sharing their racist posts.\n\nJustin Jouvenal: Very slick propaganda, which they've pushed out via social media, that's been picked up by people who are, you know perhaps, vulnerable.\n\nEmily: It was a way for Nicholas to be the bully for once.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: If you're looking at their propaganda \u2026 they're seeking to attract ostracized youth and outcast youth. Especially \u2026 white kids that are just bullied.\n\nChris: That was just him trying to get a rise outta people on the internet \u2026 And that's what he did.\n\nThe boy who once felt invisible, had found a horrendous way to get the world's attention.\n\nChris: Nicholas was not part of any Atomwaffen group. He was never part of that.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: He was an initiate in the Virginia chapter \u2026 You can't say Nick was a member of AW But you can say Nick was an initiate in AW.\n\nChris: I don't think he would ever be part of any Atomwaffen group. This was my little brother.\n\nBut just as they did when Blaze Bernstein was murdered, Atomwaffen's small membership of Nazi wannabes mocked a murder -- this time the unconscionable killing of Scott and Buckley Kuhn Fricker.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: Yeah. They made Nick Giampa propaganda.\n\nJustin Jouvenal: They sent out a tweet with his picture superimposed on a Kalashnikov.\n\nSam Woodward allegedly embraced Atomwaffen. Nick Giampa was infected by far more casual contact. But in each case, the Nazi cancer proved deadly.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: They reaffirm hate, they desensitize the viewer, and they create a sense of normalcy.\n\nTracy Smith: That this is OK.\n\nJoanna Mendelson: This is acceptable.\n\nTracy Smith: Do you think if Buckley and Scott hadn't found those Nazi images on their daughter's phone, would they still be alive today?\n\nJake Hanrahan: [Sighs] Probably.\n\nFIGHTING HATE WITH LOVE\n\nDetectives say Sam Woodward went online trolling gay men, pretending he was interested in a sexual hookup. But the D.A. believes it wasn't a hookup Sam had in mind with Blaze Bernstein; it was a setup for murder.\n\nTracy Smith: Does it seem like Sam is sexually conflicted himself?\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas | Orange County: He doesn't claim to be sexually conflicted. He claims to be somebody who hates gays and wants to cause harm to them.\n\nJake Hanrahan: In fact on his Tinder he said, \"I'm going hunting.\" \u2026The kid was planning to kill someone because of his ideology.\n\nOn Aug. 2, 2018, the Orange County D.A. added an enhancement to the charges against Sam Woodward in the murder of Blaze Bernstein. From Blaze's family to his friends, no one was surprised by the D.A.'s decision:\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas [to reporters]: This increases the maximum penalty to life without the possibility of parole. We will prove that Woodward killed Blaze because Blaze was gay.\n\nAfter police seized physical evidence, including an Atomwaffen mask in Woodward's car, they found a trove of Nazi hate on his phone and computer.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: They found evidence of Sam being involved in Atomwaffen.\n\nBlaze's murder was now considered a hate crime.\n\nD.A. Tony Rackauckas: Sam Woodward is a hater. \u2026He hates homosexuals. He hates people who are Jewish. He hates people of all different kinds of categories who are not white.\n\nFor Gideon and Jeanne Bernstein, it deepened the darkest tragedy.\n\nGideon Bernstein [to reporters]: Today we suffer an added layer of pain from learning that he was likely killed simply because of who he was as a human being.\n\nFor Blaze's oldest friend Raiah Rofsky, who is Jewish and identifies as bisexual, it brings an unsettling fear.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: I have to be careful and I'm terrified.\n\nTracy Smith: You truly feel unsafe.\n\nRaiah Rofsky: I do.\n\nRabbi Arnold Rachlis: There has to be zero tolerance of homophobia, zero tolerance of racism, of anti-Semitism, of immigrant bashing.\n\nFor Blaze's grandma Leah, who wore that yellow Nazi star, sadness and belief blend into one.\n\nLeah Bernstein: It's very painful. It's very, very hard.\n\nTracy Smith: After seeing all this, are you hopeful?\n\nLeah Bernstein: I'm very hopeful. Because there are lots of good people in the world.\n\nAnd at least one new way to fight hate with love.\n\nLeah Bernstein: Well, we BlazeItForward.\n\nCBS News\n\nBlazeItForward. Just days after they learned of their son's death, the Bernsteins made the remarkable decision to channel their grief into kindness.\n\nGideon Bernstein: Let's do something where we go onto this, you know, BlazeItForward Facebook page and tell people to give money to some charity.\n\nGideon and Jeanne targeted foster care kids and at-risk youth.\n\nThey raised money for a scholarship at OSCA, the high school where Blaze shined so bright.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein [at scholarship event]: We are delighted to award two scholarships this year from the Blaze Bernstein memorial endowment scholarship.\n\nThousands of friends and strangers gathered to honor Blaze.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: I want to do my piece to repair the world in Blaze's honor and to promote his legacy.\n\nAs they embraced each other, their community \"Blazed it\" right back.\n\nPride Parade Organizer [addressing parade goers]: This parade is rededicated as our community's official Blaze Forward OC LGBT Pride Parade\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein [addressing parade goers]: We thank you for giving us this honor. For honoring my son and his memory and for Blazing It Forward.\n\nBlazeItForward. It's much more than a slogan. It is now a calling, a new way of life for Jeanne and Gideon Bernstein. At its heart is finding some sort of silver lining in an unspeakable tragedy. And at Orange County's Pride Day, the spirit of BlazeItForward is everywhere. It's a promise made to a young man targeted by hate, now inspiring love.\n\nAnd perhaps steering one hater away from the poison that is Atomwaffen.\n\nTracy Smith: Do you feel like you owe Blaze Bernstein's family an apology?\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: Yes, I do.\n\nAnd if he is to be believed, because of the murder of Blaze Bernstein he says he's no longer a Nazi and has quit Atomwaffen.\n\nTracy Smith: You could say something now.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: To them?\n\nTracy Smith: Sure.\n\nFormer Atomwaffen member: Yeah, so, I'm so sorry that -- I'm so sorry that this happened to your son \u2026 I would like to see AW brought down. I would like to see Sam put behind bars for life.\n\nBernstein family\n\nIn Borrego Park, where Blaze Bernstein's light was extinguished, people from around the world leave stones in his memory.\n\nLeah Bernstein: It's beautiful.\n\nRichard Bernstein: You see all the stones, you feel the love.\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: I think that sometimes I dream. I can't control that. And I dream. And I wake up. And it [sighs] just haunts me. Those dreams can haunt me for days.\n\nTracy Smith: Dreams about?\n\nJeanne Pepper Bernstein: About my son.

The settlement was announced in a Phoenix courtroom. The counties have until Nov. 14 to address the issue.\n\nThe Republican lawsuit alleged that the state's county recorders don't follow a uniform standard for allowing voters to address problems with their mail-in ballots, and that Maricopa and Pima counties improperly allow the fixes for up to five days after Election Day.\n\nDemocrat Kyrsten Sinema has jumped into a slight lead over Republican Martha McSally in the midst of the slow vote count.\n\nFour local Republican parties filed a lawsuit Wednesday night challenging the state's two biggest counties for allowing voters to help resolve problems with their mail-in ballot signatures after Election Day. If the signature on the voter registration doesn't match that on the sealed envelope, both Maricopa and Pima County allow voters to help them fix, or \"cure\" it, up to five days after Election Day.\n\nMany other counties only allow voters to cure until polls close on Election Day.\n\nOnly a few thousand votes would be affected by the issue, but every one counts in the razor-close U.S. Senate race.\n\nAt a brief hearing Thursday, a Maricopa County official said only about 5,600 ballots are at affected in her county and the rate is similar in the 14 smaller counties. More than 2.2 million votes were cast statewide.\n\nOn Thursday, Sinema jumped into a minuscule lead of about 9,000 out of 1.9 million votes counted after trailing since Tuesday. Her lead came from the two counties singled out by Republicans in their lawsuit, Maricopa and Pima Counties.\n\nThe race remained too close to call with at least 400,000 ballots still uncounted. Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes said counting may continue until Nov. 15. \"We know there's urgency out there, but we want to get it right, not quick,\" he said.\n\nArizona is notoriously slow at tallying ballots even though about 75 percent of votes are cast by mail. Each of those ballots must go through a laborious verification process.", "The climate science printing press has been working overtime the past two weeks spitting out study after study. Even for a discipline used to eye-opening research, the recent revelations have been particularly alarming, and for scientists like myself, they deserve a big neon sign on Broadway.\n\nIn climate circles, what really sounded the sirens recently were three separate reports that show the oceans are warming at a staggering rate.\n\nOne study published in the scientific journal Nature concludes that the oceans are absorbing 60 percent more heat than previous estimates from the U.N.'s International Panel on Climate Change. The study calculates that over the past 25 years, the oceans gained energy equivalent to more than 5 billion Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs.\n\n\"What makes the result robust is that it actually agrees with the top of the range estimates based on temperature, which is indeed 60 percent higher than what IPCC published,\" said the lead author of the study, Laure Resplandy of Princeton University.\n\nIt should be noted that the methods used in the study are novel, prompting some caution from the scientific community. Experts at Climate Feedback, a global network of scientists, reviewed an article written on the paper. They said the \"the study's conclusions (and implications) require additional investigation.\"\n\nDr. Kevin Trenberth of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, has researched extensively on ocean heat. He was not involved in the study and has questions about some of its assertions, but said \"the results are quite compatible with our estimates for the most part. They have implications because the planet is clearly warming at faster rates than previously appreciated.\"\n\nAny previously unaccounted for heat in the oceans is significant. One unit of water holds four times the amount of heat that one unit of air holds. You can think of the oceans as our climate control, sucking up heat and keeping our daily air temperatures moderated. In fact, more than 90 percent of heat trapped by greenhouse gases is eventually stored in our oceans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). That stored ocean heat is called ocean heat content (OHC).\n\nThat leads us to a lesser-circulated report from Zeke Hausfather of Carbon Brief, a U.K.-based website covering issues related to climate. In his report on the website, Hausfather said ocean heat content just set a new record in 2018, and the year is not yet over. This is not surprising. New OHC records are set every year because the heat keeps accumulating.\n\nInsane increases in Ocean Heat Content. The best way to measure year to year warming. Human-emitted greenhouse gases trap extra heat in the atmosphere. While some of this warms the Earth\u2019s surface, upwards of 90% goes into the oceans.\u201d https://t.co/1aVQXb6Uit Nice work @hausfath pic.twitter.com/0aucn3fp7i \u2014 Jeff Berardelli (@WeatherProf) November 4, 2018\n\nThat makes the ocean a better gauge in measuring global warming trends than the atmosphere, which warms and cools more erratically. There is a very stable overall trend in the oceans.\n\nBut where does all the heat go? Some of it stays in the upper layer of the oceans, making it the heat that comes back to haunt us. Trenberth said we experience the extra ocean heat when it powers stronger hurricanes, melts ice shelves, raises sea levels and helps fuel El Nino.\n\nThe rest of the heat is dispersed throughout the ocean depths, some sinking to the bottom.\n\nAnd that leads us to the final report. For three decades, researchers have been sailing around the world on repeated cruises looking for this stored heat. New research published by NOAA shows that a portion of the heat is being stored in the oceans deepest layers, 6,000 to 20,000 feet down.\n\nThe agency concludes, \"human-caused climate change has reached one of the most remote corners of the oceans circulatory system.\"\n\nIt's now clear that the influence of man pervades every nook and cranny of this planet, even the most isolated. And while it's not clear how drastically Earth's system will react, tracking ocean heat is scientists' best tool to measure human fingerprints on the climate system.", "Diego Luna is set to star in a new \"Star Wars\" TV series for Disney's upcoming streaming service, Disney+.

Violent crime rose 6.1 percent in cities with populations of 250,000 or more in 2016, while the increase was only 2.2 percent in suburban areas and 1.6 percent in nonmetropolitan counties.\n\nThe report noted that the rates of firearm homicides varied drastically from city to city. The rate was the lowest in the Providence and Warwick, Rhode Island, area, which recorded a rate of 1.1 for every 100,000 people, and the highest in the New Orleans and Metairie, Louisiana, area, with a rate of 16.6 for every 100,000 people.\n\nWhile the increase in gun-related homicide is a recent reversal after a decade-long decline, the 2015-2016 rise in firearm suicides continues continues a 10-year trend, according to the CDC. The suicide rate jumped after the financial meltdown of 2008 and has continued to increase since then. From 2006 to 2016, suicides by firearm increased 21 percent, after declining 7 percent from 1999 to 2006.\n\nAs with gun homicides, the CDC recorded drastically different gun-related suicide rates in various areas of the country, ranging from 1.6 to 13.5 for every 100,000 people.

While some retailers are absorbing the cost of the September tariffs, consumers are likely to feel a bigger pinch in 2019. That's because the levy, which is paid for by American companies importing goods from China, will jump to 25 percent at year start.\n\nThe tariffs target a wide range of Chinese-made goods, from televisions to backpacks, according to a list released earlier this year by the U.S. Trade Representative. In recent weeks, companies have tempered profit forecasts as they rush to cut future costs by importing more goods from China now.\n\n\"Everybody's trying to bring in more goods before the holidays before the prices go up,\" said Rick Helfenbein, CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, which represents more than 1,000 brands. \"We encourage everybody who will listen, you know, if you're going to buy one sweater this Christmas, buy two.\"\n\nOne tech company, Swivl, is actively alerting its video equipment customers that its prices are likely to rise in January because of the tariffs: \"We will absorb the additional costs in order to keep our current prices until January 1st, 2019,\" founder Vlad Tetelbaum wrote in a blog post. \"At that time, our prices will increase.

Richard Westenberger, Carter's CFO, likened the looming 25 percent tariff to a spike in cotton prices that prompted the company to raise prices in 2011 amid a cotton shortage.\n\n\"During the cotton crisis we improved our pricing about -- by about 50 cents a unit,\" Westenberger said, according to a transcript of the company's recent earnings call. That year, Carter's had good sales growth \"and did a good job recovering from that spike in cotton prices. So I think we have a handle on what's possible with the price increases.\"\n\nAmerican companies paid $4.4 billion in tariffs in September, a 54 percent increase compared with 2017 according to the group of industry associations put together to protest tariffs over the summer, called Tariffs Hurt the Heartland. That figure is projected to rise next year.\n\n\"President Trump's trade war with China and the threat of even higher tariffs in 2019 have created a mini-boom in imports and businesses have rushed to bring goods into the country ahead of the tariffs,\" Ben Hackett, the founder of Hackett Associates, said in the National Retail Federation statement. \"We are clearly in a politically motivated trade environment.\"\n\nLuckily for many retailers, they are looking at the strongest growth in holiday sales since 2011, thanks to healthy consumer confidence, low unemployment and growing wages.

Across the Bay Area, residents took precaution as the raging Camp Fire's massive smoke plume enveloped the region, prompting authorities to classify air quality in some parts as unhealthy, CBS SF Bay Area reports.\n\nMany residents awoke Friday with their homes filled with the smell of burning wood. Officials issued an air quality advisory for smoke for the Bay Area region starting Thursday and lasting through Friday. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District also issued a Winter Spare the Air Alert, making it illegal to use fireplaces, wood stoves, pellet stoves or fire pits while the alert is in effect.\n\nThe government agency warned that \"heavy smoke from the Camp Fire in Butte County is causing very elevated levels of particulate pollution in the region, especially in the North and East Bay.\"\n\nOfficials advised children and older people to move any physical activities indoors, while everyone was encouraged to limit their outdoor activity.\n\nAccording to the federal EPA air quality site, Alameda, California, had an unhealthy air index of 165 and a particle pollution measure of PM2.5. That's the same particle pollution measurement as Beijing, China \u2014 a city notorious for some of the worst air pollution in the world.\n\nOakland resident Danny Wertheimer wore a surgical mask as he went for his Thursday evening walk in Oakland. \"I looked out my window and I saw the smoke filter in,\" he said. \"It looked bad.

The scare heightened tensions before the crucial midterm elections, but he was arrested within days.\n\nProsecutors followed through on a promise to upgrade the charges with an indictment that led with five counts alleging use of a weapon of mass destruction. The document said he mailed 16 improvised explosive devices though the U.S. mail to victims across the country.\n\nThe charges said he aimed to \"kill, injure and intimidate an individual and unlawfully to damage and destroy a building, vehicle, and other real and person property.\"\n\nNone of the devices \u2014 some of which arrived at New York addresses \u2014 exploded.\n\nA message left with Sayoc's lawyer was not immediately returned.\n\nSayoc appeared in New York earlier this week. He was held without bail. Sayoc had been arrested outside a South Florida auto parts store. He had been living in a van covered with stickers of Trump and showing images of some Trump opponents with crosshairs over their faces.\n\nIn the indictment, prosecutors noted that an improvised explosive mailed to former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in Chappaqua, New York, contained a picture of Clinton and members of her family marked with a red \"X.\"\n\nThe indictment said others targeted by the mailings also received similarly marked pictures of themselves along with the explosives.\n\nOthers targeted by the mailings included former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Packages were also mailed to CNN in New York and Atlanta.\n\nProsecutors say evidence against Sayoc includes DNA linking him to 10 of the explosive devices and fingerprints on two of them.\n\nThe case was randomly assigned to U.S. District Judge Jed S.

Two years earlier, the former Vice President had lost a razor-thin presidential election to John F. Kennedy, and he had just lost his second high-profile election, this time to be Governor of California.\n\nEven Pat Buchanan, who would become one of Nixon's speechwriters, knew rehabilitating him would be tough. \"He was a loser; he had lost and lost and lost. The only way you that you get rid of this loser image is to win!\" Buchanan laughed.\n\nBut by 1968, the stage was being set for a \"law and order\" candidate like Nixon.\n\n\"The country was prerevolutionary in 1968,\" said historian Evan Thomas, the author of \"Being Nixon: A Man Divided\" (Random House). \"There were race riots, riots on campuses. The country was divided in a way that it had not been since the Civil War, worse than it is today.\"\n\nRandom House\n\nNixon's main Republican rivals, George Romney and Nelson Rockefeller, dropped out.\n\n\"Nixon was lucky in that the Republican Party was falling apart around him,\" said Thomas. \"And Nixon, the old pro, was there to fill the vacuum.\"\n\n\"So, was Nixon lucky or good?\" asked correspondent Richard Schlesinger.\n\n\"All great politicians are lucky and good, and Nixon was both.\"\n\nLucky for Nixon, the Democrats were being divided on the left by the Vietnam War, and on the right by George Wallace, who was siphoning off voters attracted by his race-based populism.\n\nNixon was ready to get kicked around again, but he still had a lot of kick left in him. He told CBS News' Mike Wallace, \"Those who have lost elections in the past have come back to win. I hope to come back to win.\"\n\nThe plan was to run against Lyndon Johnson, the incumbent president. But just two months after Nixon got into the race, luckily for him everything changed. Johnson announced on March 31, 1968. \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\n\nBuchanan recalled telling Nixon on board the candidate's plane that, after his Republican competitors had dropped out, now the Democratic president had, too.\n\n\"Did he seem surprised?\" asked Schlesinger.\n\n\"Oh, he was stunned. We were stunned!\" Buchanan said.\n\nNixon accepted the Republican nomination in August of 1968, just a few weeks before his biggest break yet. The Democrats had their calamitous convention in Chicago. While the cops were outside clubbing demonstrators on the head, delegates were inside shooting themselves in the foot.\n\nThomas said, \"Nixon loved every minute of the Democratic convention. 'Don't elect those crazy Democrats; you're going to have riots in the streets. Elect me, and I'll bring some order and quiet.'\"\n\nVice President Hubert Humphrey won the nomination, but as his old friend, then-Senator Walter Mondale remembers, it didn't mean much.\n\n\"He finally had his chance, and the nomination was worthless,\" Mondale said.\n\nWorthless? \"Well, proved to be worth something, but at the time, it looked like it was poisoned.\"\n\nBy contrast, Nixon's campaign ran with military-grade discipline. He traveled with an entourage of managers and message men, overseen by John Mitchell. \"We do operate, I believe, in an orderly fashion, and that comes from preparation,\" Mitchell said then. \"We have planned it and programmed it and have had the time to carry it out.\"\n\nIt was all working. Nixon was up, way up in the polls, until September 30, when Humphrey turned the tide with a speech repudiating President Johnson's war policy. \"I want to talk with you about Vietnam,\" the Vice President said. \"As president I would stop the bombing of the North, as an acceptable risk for peace.\"\n\nThe announcement would narrow the polls dramatically. Nixon immediately had an unexpected order for his personal aide, Dwight Chapin: \"Get President Johnson on the phone.\"\n\n\"He said it to me,\" Chapin said. \"And I had no idea what to do! So I asked Rose Woods, who was Nixon's secretary, She said, 'Call 456-1414 in Washington. That's the White House number, and ask to speak to the president.'\"\n\nPresident Johnson recorded the call, in which Nixon said of Humphrey's announcement, \"This will be interpreted, as I'm sure you know, as a dramatic move away from the administration. It's my intention not to move in that direction.\"\n\nSchlesinger asked Chapin, \"Did you have a sense of how strange that call was?\"\n\n\"I felt that it was one of the most intriguing political maneuvers that I had ever heard,\" he replied. \"For Richard Nixon to be calling Lyndon Johnson and he's telling the president, 'I'm with you,' not exactly the words, but implying it.\"\n\nMondale thinks it's evidence that Johnson might have been rooting against his own party's nominee, his own vice president.\n\nSchlesinger asked, \"Do you think Johnson wanted Humphrey to win?\"\n\n\"Maybe. I'm not sure,\" Mondale said. \"I think at the end, the last two weeks, he wanted him to win. But I think the early part of the campaign, he was mad at Humphrey. He thought Humphrey wasn't being loyal enough.\"\n\n\"Do you think Johnson wanted Nixon to win?\"\n\n\"I thought so for a while, because he was doing things to help Nixon,\" Mondale said.\n\nAP Photo\n\nBut Johnson ended up helping Humphrey come within a hair of winning, with a speech on October 31, five days before the election, announcing a halt to the bombardment of North Vietnam.\n\nBuchanan said, \"I thought we had lost. Humphrey had momentum.\"\n\n\"I thought we could make it,\" said Mondale.\n\n\"I bet those must have been very heady days,\" said Schlesinger.\n\n\"Yes. Might get a Minnesotan president!\" laughed the Minnesotan who'd succeeded Humphrey in the Senate in 1964.\n\nThey almost did. But Nixon held on to win by just about 500,000 votes.\n\nRichard Nixon had known bitter defeat in elections even closer than this, and he was magnanimous in victory. He had Dwight Chapin set up a meeting with Humphrey just days after the election, and as the meeting ended, Chapin saw a side of Nixon few others ever saw.\n\n\"The men had their arms around one another,\" Chapin said. \"Humphrey was sobbing. Nixon was patting him on the back saying, 'Hubert, you know, everything's gonna be okay. You and Muriel [are] gonna have a great life.' Humphrey chokes out, 'If there's anything that I can ever do, I wanna be doing it for you.' It was such a poignant moment.\"\n\nPresident Richard Nixon was reelected in 1972. Two years later, the Watergate scandal led to his resignation.\n\nDwight Chapin served eight months in prison in connection with Watergate. He is writing a memoir.\n\nPat Buchanan ran unsuccessfully for president in 1992, 1996 and 2000.\n\nWalter Mondale served as Vice President in the Carter administration and then ran unsuccessfully for president in 1984.

This is the first person in Utah to die from rabies since 1944, according to the state's health department. The person's name and other details were not released.\n\nRabies is a viral disease in mammals that infects the central nervous system. If left untreated, it attacks the brain and ultimately causes death.\n\nThe incidence of rabies has dramatically dropped in the United States over the past 100 years, but the threat still exists.\n\nIn fact, earlier this year, a 6-year-old Florida boy died from rabies after being scratched by infected bat. The boy's father washed the wound thoroughly but didn't take the boy to the hospital because he cried when he was told he would get shots, according to local reports. The child developed symptoms a week later and soon died.\n\nA couple of months later, a coyote that tested positive for rabies bit 8 people in suburban Westchester, New York, before being shot and killed by police. Everyone who had been exposed in this case received preventive treatment so there were no fatalities.\n\nThe majority of rabies cases reported to the CDC each year occur in wild animals like raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes.\n\nIn Utah, officials say people and animals are most likely to come into contact with rabies through exposure to bats.\n\n\"If you find yourself near a bat, dead or alive, do not touch, hit, or kill it,\" Dallin Peterson, epidemiologist with the Utah Department of Health, said in a statement.\n\nBecause the animals' teeth and claws are so small, a bite or scratch may not even be noticeable. This can be especially concerning if a bat has entered your bedroom while you're sleeping.\n\n\"If you've awakened and see a bat in your bedroom, you should assume you've been bitten in your sleep even if you haven't felt it or see a bite mark and go to the local emergency room,\" Noreen Hynes, M.D., director of the Johns Hopkins Geographic Medicine Center of the Division of Infectious Diseases, told CBS News.\n\nSymptoms of rabies\n\nExperts stress the importance of seeking treatment right away, because once symptoms start to appear, it's already too late. The first symptoms of rabies include fever, headache, and general weakness or discomfort. There may also be a prickling or itching sensation in the area of the bite.\n\nMore specific symptoms will begin to show as the disease progresses, including insomnia, anxiety, confusion, and agitation. Partial paralysis may set in and the person may have hallucinations and delirium. Other symptoms include an increase in saliva, difficulty swallowing, and hydrophobia (fear of water) because of the difficulty swallowing.\n\nDeath usually occurs within a few days after symptoms appear.\n\n\"Once there's a single symptom of rabies, it is no longer treatable,\" Hynes said.\n\nTreatment for rabies\n\nThe good news is that death from rabies is 100 percent preventable.\n\nThe first thing you should do if bitten or scratched is wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water to reduce the risk of infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises.\n\nSee your doctor if you have been bitten or scratched by a wild animal, or any animal if you don't know whether it's been vaccinated or not. Your doctor, possibly in consultation with state or local health authorities, will decide if you need rabies vaccine shots.\n\nThe vaccine \u2014 given in a series of shots called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) \u2014 prevents rabies symptoms from developing. Health officials say the current treatment is much less painful than in years past.\n\nEach year, about 40,000 people nationwide receive the rabies prevention treatment, according to the Utah Department of Health, after a bite or scratch from a domestic animal, such as dogs or cats, with unknown vaccination status.\n\nDeath from rabies is rare in the U.S., with only one or two fatalities occurring each year. The statistics are different in less developed nations, where more than 55,000 people die each year from the disease, mostly in Africa and Asia.\n\nReducing the risk of rabies\n\nOfficials recommend following these guidelines to help reduce your risk for getting rabies:\n\nEnsure your pets' rabies vaccines are up-to-date.\n\nNever touch a bat.\n\nKeep your pets inside and supervise them when outside. This will help keep your pets from coming in contact with wild animals that could spread rabies.\n\nReport stray animals to local authorities.\n\nDon't approach wild animals.\n\nIn domestic animals, look out for signs of rabies, including behavior changes, general sickness, trouble swallowing, an increase in drool or saliva, and biting at everything if excited.\n\nIf you're traveling to a country where rabies is common and you'll be there for an extended period of time, ask your doctor whether you should receive the rabies vaccine before you travel.", "", "A Wells Fargo executive who reportedly referred to women bank employees as \"girls\" or told them to put their \"big girl panties on\" will step down next year.\n\nWithout addressing claims made against him, Wells Fargo confirmed that private bank head Jay Welker would retire effective March 31.

The group broke up briefly, then reached a detente: no drugs before a show or onstage.\n\nIn this excerpt from his new memoir, \"Thanks a Lot Mr. Kibblewhite: My Story\" (published by Henry Holt and Co.), Daltrey writes about recording the title track of 1965's \"My Generation,\" named by Rolling Stone magazine as the 11th greatest song of all time.\n\nRead the excerpt below (you can listen along to an excerpt from Roger Daltrey's audio book recording), and don't miss Jim Axelrod's interview with Daltrey on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" November 11!\n\nRoger Daltrey reads from \"Thanks a Lot Mr. Kibblewhite\" Your browser does not support the audio element.\n\nOn October 13, 1965, two weeks after we split up, two days before we got back together again, we arrived at IBC studios in Portland Place to finish our much-delayed debut LP. I think the atmosphere was quite frosty, which was a good thing because we were going to record \"My Generation.\" Pete had written the song six months earlier, after the Queen Mother got his Packard hearse\u2014yes, he had a hearse\u2014towed from outside his flat because it'd reminded Her Majesty of Her Majesty's late husband.\n\nHenry Holt\n\nThat was just the sort of thing that could wind him up for a week. How dare she.\n\nThe first demo he played us was much slower. More of a chink-a- chink-a-chink Bo Diddley number. I didn't like it. Kit wasn't sure either, but he told him to keep going. The second demo had the key changes and the call and response, but it still didn't feel right.\n\nThen we got to IBC studios and Keith just stuck it on the onbeat, which gave it the kick up the arse it needed. That was the thing about Moon\u2014he was never a conformist drummer. He never practiced. He just did it. When you tried to pin him down to a straight four-four time, it was impossible. He could do it but it killed him to do it. The whole reason for his genius was the absolute, utter anarchy. So he was off, on the onbeat, full of aggression. I tried to follow him and I stuttered on the first line. Next take, I corrected it, but Kit popped out and said, \"Keep it. Keep that in.\" Pete had a long \"fffff\" in the demo. \"Why don't you all ffffffffade away?\" But it wasn't a stutter. Not until Kit came out and said keep it. \"Keep that blues stutter.\" And it worked. To me, it wasn't a sign of weakness. It wasn't a slip of the tongue. It was aggression, pure aggression, pushed forward by that onbeat. Bottled-up rage, barely controlled, spilling out onto vinyl, shouting I hope I die before I get old.\n\nAlmost all the great things that happen in studios are accidents, and that's when you've got to rely on your producers to spot the ones that work and the ones that don't. Pete always hated Kit's production. I understand technically why Pete didn't like it. Some of the mixes Kit did were terrible. He was always a bit bass-light, which used to upset John, but recording circumstances were difficult in those days. We only had a three-track recorder\u2014eight-tracks were still three years away\u2014so we didn't have a lot to play with. But Kit was incredibly adventurous. He'd fly in, throw everything at the wall, tear it down, and rebuild it. We'd do layers and layers. We'd do harmonies all over the place, building them up by bouncing one track onto another on those three-tracks. This allowed us to get the backing vocal harmonies sounding like we were a twelve-piece vocal group. The price to pay for this was that these things had to be mixed at the time of recording and that mix could never be changed. Put on too much echo and the result was permanent.\n\n\"My Generation\" didn't need all that. It just needed a punch. It was another street song, like \"Anyway Anyhow Anywhere,\" and I think, Zen ducks aside, we were all in the mood for a bit of aggression. We were in the mood to tell everyone to f-f- f-fade away. So the stutter stayed, we crashed through the rest of the album, and we went home.\n\nThe track was released at the end of October and the album came out on December 3. It should have been a great end to the year, but it wasn't quite like that. I was still the enemy. Everyone was talking about leaving. Keith and John were going to do their own thing. Keith asked Paul McCartney if he could join the Beatles. \"We already have a drummer,\" said Paul. Then he was going to join the Animals. Then he was going to join the Nashville Teens. Pete was going to join a supergroup with Paddy, Klaus, and Gibson.\n\nThe legal battles didn't help. Kit and Chris had fallen out with Shel Talmy. For five months, they were in and out of the High Court, trying to break Talmy's contract, and all that time we couldn't release any more music. Given that the average band lasts eighteen months and we were far more volatile than the average band, five months was a lifetime.\n\nBut we just kept gigging. We played our last show at the Goldhawk Road Social Club on December 3, 1965. This had been our home turf since the beginning, so it's been described as an important moment. A turning point. The night we left our mod roots behind. It certainly wasn't a particularly salubrious night. Someone remembers a bouncer with a big stick on the end of a chain. But there was always a bouncer and they never needed big sticks on chains. They were massive. And I think the audience has made much more of it than we did. We weren't leaving them behind. We were moving on because we couldn't get them all in the place. I wasn't moving on from being a mod either because I was never a mod in the first place.\n\nI've always been the same through my life. I never liked uniforms. When everybody else was wearing mod gear, I'd wear a leather jacket. And when they were wearing leather jackets, I'd wear a suede coat. We might have been the mod band. Dressing like a mod did the job for a while. But I didn't feel that we had to answer to anybody. I felt, and Pete did, too, that by the time we were making our own music, people were following us for that, not how we dressed.\n\n\n\nExcerpted from \"Thanks a Lot Mr. Kibblewhite: My Story\" by Roger Daltrey.

At least that was her excuse for nagging a young hiker she met along the Pacific Crest Trail in Washington State a couple weeks ago.\n\nThat hiker's name was Katharina Groene, and all Katharina did was mention to Nancy her plan to continue hiking alone up to the Canadian border.\n\n\"She was from Germany. She had no idea what she was getting into,\" Nancy said, adding that she tried to talk her out of it.\n\n\"In fact I told her, 'If you were my daughter I wouldn't let you do this,'\" Nancy said.\n\nNancy Abell\n\nKatharina had already walked the first 2,500 miles of the trail, which starts at the Mexican border, and she had just 150 to go. So Katharina brushed aside nosy Nancy's carping concern.\n\n\"That's the last I saw of her,\" Nancy said.\n\nBut it wasn't the last of her worry. For the next seven nights, Nancy grew increasingly restless. She knew it was pretty late in the season to be walking that final stretch without snowshoes. When she read the forecast for two feet of snow in the mountains, Nancy went full-on mother hen.\n\n\"I was really stressed out. I felt really compelled that I really needed to get help for her,\" Nancy said.\n\nShe called 911 to report a hiker who was \"probably at risk.\" Now, as a general rule, the authorities don't go looking for missing people who aren't missing. This hiker hadn't put out a distress call and hadn't even missed a checkpoint. Yet somehow, Nancy convinced them that her hunch was an educated one, so they went searching.\n\nThe Snohomish County Sheriff's department scoured the mountains where Nancy suggested. That's when they spotted her \u2013 frostbit, with maybe a day to live. The rescue crew said Nancy saved Katharina's life.\n\nNeedless to say, Nancy is sleeping much better now. She invited Katharina to stay with her for a few days before her flight back to Germany. As for Katharina, she said Nancy rescued her in more ways than one.\n\nCBS News\n\n\"Someone cared,\" Katharina said.\n\nShe said the whole reason she did the hike alone was because she'd given up on people.\n\n\"I lost faith in humanity,\" Katharina said.\n\nBut she said she got her faith back in a \"really big way.\"\n\n\"Come to America,\" Katharina said.\n\nSo if you need faith restored, come to America -- or just find your nearest mom.\n\nTo contact On the Road, or to send us a story idea, email us: OnTheRoad@cbsnews.com.", "", "If Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg refuses to address an unprecedented joint \"international grand committee\" of members of at least five parliaments on Nov. 27, a Canadian politician told CBS News he'll consider issuing a subpoena for the social media baron to appear before that country's legislature, which could even hold Zuckerberg in contempt if he's a no-show again.\n\nZuckerberg initially turned down an initial invitation by Canadian Member of Parliament Bob Zimmer and his British counterpart Damian Collins, whose committees are investigating disinformation and online election influence campaigns, but he was invited again Wednesday after Argentina, Australia and Ireland signed on to the joint inquiry.\n\nA spokesperson for the British Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, which is heading up the effort, wrote in an email to CBS News Friday that lawmakers from even more countries may soon join the effort.\n\n\"There is growing interest from other nations to join the committee,\" the spokesperson said. She did not indicate which specific countries are interested.\n\nFacebook was given a Nov. 12 deadline to reply to the renewed offer, and has not yet done so. The company did not respond when asked if the total number of nations involved in the committee would affect its decision.\n\nZimmer, who is chair of the Canadian Parliament's Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics, said the growling list of countries participating should be a sign to Facebook that the governments won't be satisfied unless Zuckerberg meets with them.\n\n\"What we hope he's seeing in us is that we're not quitting,\" Zimmer said. \"There are some tools in Parliament that we have available. We can subpoena him and if he does not come we can hold him in contempt.\"\n\nZimmer acknowledged that because Zuckerberg is an American citizen, he cannot be forced to appear before Canada's governing body, but added, \"If he wants to do business in Canada being held in contempt isn't helpful.\"\n\n\"Being held in contempt of Parliament really does not look good on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\" Zimmer said.\n\nFacebook did not reply to a question from CBS News about the possibility that Zuckerberg could face a subpoena or contempt finding.\n\nContempt of parliament citations for individuals have very rarely been invoked in Canada's history. The most recent instance was a 2011 case involving a government official accused of misleading a committee.\n\nThe effort to get Zuckerberg to appear before the multi-nation investigation comes after Britain's Information Commissioner released a report Monday concluding that \"Facebook... failed to keep [users'] personal information secure because it failed to make suitable checks on apps and developers using its platform.\"\n\nHer conclusion mirrors that of a scathing preliminary report on \"disinformation and fake news\" written by the U.K. committee in July.

I mean mining is one of those activities where at the end of every shift you know whether you won or lost.\n\nGold was the lifeblood of South Africa. The way it's dug out has changed little since apartheid when underpaid black miners often worked in mortal danger. At its worst, more than 800 workers a year died in mining accidents. No coincidence the struggle that led to apartheid's defeat started underground.\n\nBill Whitaker: Gold and gold mining seem to be in the DNA of South Africa.\n\nBernard Swanepoel: South African gold mining especially has always been at the center of all political and other activities in our country. I mean our bad apartheid history is intertwined with gold mining. I mean a lot of the-- a lot of the legislation to dispossess black people of land was in order to create cheap labor for South African gold mines.\n\nBill Whitaker: You grew up in a small mining town, during the era of apartheid. What are your strongest memories?\n\nBernard Swanepoel: Well, ultimately I'm a privileged person that, because I was white and I was male, those were the two requirements at the time to become a mining engineer.\n\nBill Whitaker: So are you the new face of South African mining?\n\nMonga Kasongo: I will say yes. We are the new generation in the mining.\n\nJust a dozen years after apartheid ended, engineer Monga Kasongo started managing the smelter. He told us he chose to move here from the Congo to work in the mines.\n\nBill Whitaker: Has that wound in South Africa been healed?\n\nMonga Kasongo: Not 100 percent healed. But there is some healing happening, there is some healing, yes because you have a different-- different people working in the mines and the mindset has been changing.\n\nNow safety is paramount. You'll find women underground and blacks are senior managers. Once some of the lowest-paid laborers are now among the highest. But this generation of gold miners know they may be the last. Of the 11 gold mines that once flourished around here, only three still operate. The mines are now so deep, it's becoming too expensive to get the gold out. The story of the ultra-deep mines is nearing its final chapter. To dig the riches from such astounding depths took grit and brute force.

A crustacean, about one sixty-fourth of an inch. An arthropod, a flatworm, and single-cell bacteria. It set off a storm of speculation about where else extreme life might exist, perhaps even on Mars. NASA helped fund their research.\n\nGaetan Borgonie: If there is life here in the deep, then you should definitely dig on Mars because if life was ever there you will find some life form, I believe very strongly, still on Mars.\n\nBill Whitaker: So the Martians we meet in the future could be these single-cell organisms you're--\n\nGaetan Borgonie: I think that would be the--\n\nBill Whitaker: --you're talking about.\n\nGaetan Borgonie: --that is-- yes, indeed. I think that would be the most likely. But be prepared to be surprised, I would say.\n\nSouth Africa's gold mines are now so deep they might as well be on another planet.\n\nCBS News\n\nBernard Swanepoel: I'm not sure that we really want to send human beings much deeper.\n\nBernard Swanepoel started his career underground and ended it as the CEO of Harmony Gold, which now owns Moab Khotsong.\n\nBernard Swanepoel: If you are in a successful mining team, it must be like a successful sports team. I mean mining is one of those activities where at the end of every shift you know whether you won or lost.\n\nGold was the lifeblood of South Africa. The way it's dug out has changed little since apartheid when underpaid black miners often worked in mortal danger. At its worst, more than 800 workers a year died in mining accidents. No coincidence the struggle that led to apartheid's defeat started underground.\n\nBill Whitaker: Gold and gold mining seem to be in the DNA of South Africa.\n\nBernard Swanepoel: South African gold mining especially has always been at the center of all political and other activities in our country. I mean our bad apartheid history is intertwined with gold mining. I mean a lot of the-- a lot of the legislation to dispossess black people of land was in order to create cheap labor for South African gold mines.\n\nBill Whitaker: You grew up in a small mining town, during the era of apartheid. What are your strongest memories?\n\nBernard Swanepoel: Well, ultimately I'm a privileged person that, because I was white and I was male, those were the two requirements at the time to become a mining engineer.\n\nBill Whitaker: So are you the new face of South African mining?\n\nMonga Kasongo: I will say yes. We are the new generation in the mining.\n\nJust a dozen years after apartheid ended, engineer Monga Kasongo started managing the smelter. He told us he chose to move here from the Congo to work in the mines.\n\nBill Whitaker: Has that wound in South Africa been healed?\n\nMonga Kasongo: Not 100 percent healed. But there is some healing happening, there is some healing, yes because you have a different-- different people working in the mines and the mindset has been changing.\n\nNow safety is paramount. You'll find women underground and blacks are senior managers. Once some of the lowest-paid laborers are now among the highest. But this generation of gold miners know they may be the last. Of the 11 gold mines that once flourished around here, only three still operate. The mines are now so deep, it's becoming too expensive to get the gold out. The story of the ultra-deep mines is nearing its final chapter. To dig the riches from such astounding depths took grit and brute force. Now South Africa's resolve must be deployed to solving the next challenge: what to do when the gold runs out.\n\nProduced by Heather Abbott.

Why can't women make movies about men?\"\n\nThe film stars Tony Revolori as Nathan, a teenager embarking on a solo road trip to begin art college, who picks up Richard (Jason Mantzoukas), a motormouth drifter, along the way.\n\nRevolori says he and his co-star first met in a situation that forced them to learn how to work as a team immediately.\n\n\"The first time I met him was in an escape room,\" he says. \"Having that escape room experience \u2014 we learned that we got along very well, so we could be in a car for hours on end and have chats about anything from politics to jokes to history.\" By the way, they did escape the room, even with just the two of them.\n\nRevolori's Nathan is much more reticent than Mantzoukas' manic character, but he says he enjoyed the dynamic.\n\n\"It's not so much that Nathan has less to say, it's just that Richard is spouting a bit more nonsense and really has no filter and lets out everything, as opposed to Nathan being more cautious,\" he explains. \"I knew I had to play Batman to the Joker, which was fine, and it was great and we kind of switched around a little bit. We don't stick to that model all the time, which is awesome that we were able to explore different aspects of the characters.\" Revolori says he enjoyed seeing his character grow by the end of the story: \"He's making decisions for himself confidently and assertively and it's him growing and learning.\"\n\nAt one point in the film, during an argument, Richard accuses Nathan of using him for his own amusement and art, while Nathan hits back that Richard is using him for a ride and money.\n\n\"That's human nature in general; we all use each other and it doesn't have to have a negative connotation,\" says Revolori of his character. \"But yeah, I do think they were using each other for one, company, and two, his own art, and three, Richard wanting to have someone to talk to. Sometimes human connection is something people strive for the most, so I do think they were kind of using each other.\"\n\n\"The Long Dumb Road\" is not a straightforward comedy, blending in serious moments along with the absurd. Fidell wrote the script with Carson Mell, who writes for \"Silicon Valley.\" She says, \"He very much handled the jokes and I handled the inherent drama \u2014 I think the best comedy comes from drama.\"\n\nFidell says that their different sensibilities occasionally put them at odds with each other, particularly over a tense scene in the film in which Richard curses out a woman.\n\n\"He really didn't want to have Richard say the C-word and I fought for it,\" she says. \"I really needed Richard to be unhinged. I needed it to be a scary moment. I needed it to propel the story in a new direction and if he said anything else, it wouldn't have made the right impact, and I am actually glad I fought for that.\n\nThe film has a sadness to it, and Fidell says that she intentionally set out to subvert the buddy comedy genre.\n\n\"I don't think anything I do will not have an undercurrent of sadness to it,\" she says with a laugh.\n\n\"The Long Dumb Road\" is in theaters now.", "", "", "", "As Florida heads towards a machine recount for the Senate and gubernatorial races, prominent Republicans are alleging voter fraud by Democrats trying to create new votes for their candidates. Republicans have not cited any evidence to back up their accusations, but both parties have expressed frustration with Broward County, whose beleaguered electoral system has been under scrutiny since ballot confusion played a major role in the 2000 presidential election.\n\n\"Every Floridian should be concerned there may be rampant fraud happening in Palm Beach and Broward counties,\" Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott said in a press conference Thursday evening. Scott is currently 15,000 votes ahead of incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. \"I will not sit idly by while unethical liberals try to steal this election from the people of Florida,\" Scott added, though he offered no proof to back up his claim.\n\nPresident Trump has echoed Scott's ire on Twitter. \"Law Enforcement is looking into another big corruption scandal having to do with Election Fraud in #Broward and Palm Beach. Florida voted for Rick Scott!\" Mr. Trump wrote, referring also to Palm Beach County, which has also been slow in its vote-counting process.\n\nScott filed a lawsuit against Broward County Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes on Thursday, claiming that Snipes is withholding information and should reveal how many ballots are left to count. He also filed suit against Palm Beach County Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher, and a West Palm Beach circuit court judge ruled in favor of Scott and granted an injunction ordering Bucher to submit \"overvoted\" and \"undervoted\" absentee ballots to the Palm Beach County Canvassing Board for an open and public review of each vote before they are counted.\n\nNelson filed a lawsuit Friday morning asking that the deadline for local election officials to file preliminary unofficial vote totals to the state be extended past noon Saturday, a deadline dictated by Florida law. If the margin between two candidates is half a percentage point or less by Saturday, the state must do a machine recount. Scott's campaign fired back in a statement.\n\n\"They aim to disenfranchise law abiding Florida voters by producing ballots out of thin air until they have enough to win,\" Scott campaign manager Jackie Schutz Zeckman said in a press release Friday, accusing Nelson's campaign of \"working on voter fraud.\"\n\nIn a statement on Friday afternoon, Nelson countered that Scott \"is abusing the full force of his public office as governor to stop a complete and accurate counting of all the votes in Florida.\"\n\nBroward County is at the center of the controversy in part because nearly 25,000 more votes were cast for governor than for the Senate, a discrepancy larger than the current margin between Nelson and Scott. The Broward County ballot was designed so that the Senate race appeared in the lower left-hand corner, below the instructions, spurring the theory that many voters missed the contest.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, thousands of ballots remained to be counted. Snipes claimed that this was because of the high volume of mail-in ballots which arrived before the deadline on Tuesday. Both Snipes and Bucher claim that few ballots remain to be counted, according to the Florida Sun-Sentinel. The Elections Canvassing Boards of Broward and Palm Beach Counties were set to meet Friday afternoon. New York Times reporter Patricia Mazzei captured video of protesters chanting \"lock her up\" about Snipes before the meeting in Broward.\n\nThe scene at the Broward elections office where the canvassing board is preparing to meet. Also chants of, \u201cLock her up!\u201d pic.twitter.com/sfJ98ubdt3 \u2014 Patricia Mazzei (@PatriciaMazzei) November 9, 2018\n\nSnipes has previously been accused of mismanaging elections, and a a circuit court judge ruled that Snipes broke federal and state law by too quickly destroying ballots from the August 2016 primaries earlier this year. She also was unable to explain why ballot counting was going so slowly, telling local reporters that it was because of Broward's large population, although Miami-Dade County has a similarly large population and had votes counted more quickly.\n\nMr. Trump has been fuming over the situation in Florida, hinting at unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud on the parts of Democrats, and on Friday tweeted a threat of federal intervention -- that he is \"sending much better lawyers\" than the Democrats have \"to expose the FRAUD!\"\n\nAs soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer, Marc Elias, to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes. Don\u2019t worry, Florida - I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018\n\n\"As soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer, Marc Elias, to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes. Don't worry, Florida - I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD!\" he tweeted on his way to Paris to celebrate Armistice Day.\n\nMoments before that tweet, the president \u2014 who might interact with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Paris this weekend \u2014 appeared to mock allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election as he questioned why people are \"just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia.\"\n\n\"You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia \u2013 but the Election was on Tuesday? Let's blame the Russians and demand and immediate apology from President Putin!\" he tweeted.\n\nHe continued to tweet about Broward County specifically on his flight to France. \"Mayor Gillum conceded on Election Day and now Broward County has put him \"back into play.\" Bill Nelson conceded Election - now he's back in play!? This is an embarrassment to our Country and to Democracy!\" Mr. Trump tweeted. Nelson actually did not concede to Scott, but Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum did concede to Republican Ron DeSantis on election day. A concession is largely symbolic and not legally binding.\n\n\"In the 2016 Election I was winning by so much in Florida that Broward County, which was very late with vote tabulation and probably getting ready to do a \"number,\" couldn't do it because not enough people live in Broward for them to falsify a victory!\" Mr. Trump said in another tweet. In 2016, Broward's electronic voting system was later found to have been targeted by Russian government hackers, although it's unclear if that had an effect on election results.\n\nWhen CBS News' chief White House correspondent Major Garrett asked Friday morning \u2014 before the president suggested he'll send lawyers down to Florida \u2014 whether the federal government will get involved, the president said that \"could be.\" Mr. Trump blasted the records of Broward County in particular, saying they're \"finding votes out of nowhere\" now.\n\n\"Well it could be because if you look at Broward and Palm Beach to a lesser extent, if you look at Broward County, they have had a horrible history,\" the president told reporters on the White House South Lawn.\n\n\"And Rick Scott who won by, you know it was close, but he won by a comfortable margin, every couple of hours it goes down a little bit,\" he added.\n\nMr. Trump has raised the possibility of voter fraud in the past, after the 2016 elections, creating an entire commission to investigate it nationwide. The president ultimately disbanded the commission, which issued a report suggesting voter fraud is not nearly as widespread as the president claims.", "Massive wildfires are tearing through parts of California, destroying hundreds buildings and forcing thousands of people from their homes. An emergency evacuation order was issued for several neighborhoods west of Los Angeles as firefighters frantically fought back the Woolsey Fire. The Camp Fire in Northern California exploded in size Thursday, burning about 20,000 acres and overtaking the town of Paradise, where around 30,000 people were forced to evacuate at the last minute.\n\nThe fire in Paradise burned fast, reports CBS News' David Begnaud. At one point, the unrelenting flames burned about 2,000 acres per hour taking down everything \u2013 big box stores, homes, and businesses \u2013 in its path. Nearly 2,300 firefighters are battling the flames, but as of Friday morning, it was still zero percent contained.\n\nSurrounded by walls of flames, people drove through hell trying to escape as their homes burned to the ground. Powerful winds caused the Camp Fire to spread quickly, filling the sky with toxic smoke that could be seen from San Francisco.\n\n\"We grabbed our animals and some food and some clothes and we're getting the heck out of here,\" one man said.\n\nThere was little time for the 27,000 people who live in Paradise to evacuate. Some were forced to abandon their cars and sprint to safety as the intense flames closed in. Those who couldn't leave were taken to refuge centers until danger passed.\n\n\"Everything was ignited by the time I got out of my house, everything was on fire,\" another person said.\n\nCal Fire Capt. Scott McLean said Paradise is no longer standing.\n\n\"We're talking devastated,\" McLean said. \"The town center is completely on the ground. The south side as well as the north side has been hit very hard as well.\"\n\nRetired engineer Duane D'Amico and his dog narrowly escaped the oncoming flames.\n\n\"I hope people got out. I woke up all my neighbors, got them out of bed. Next thing you know their house is on fire. I saved their lives,\" D'Amico said. \"I don't think, there's not going to be a home left in Paradise. I don't know. When I left it was all on fire.\"\n\nWinds are expected to die down Friday morning and firefighters said that should help for now, but they are expected to pick back up again on Sunday. Fire officials said it could take days to figure out how many people died.\n\nMeanwhile, the intensifying Woolsey Fire in Oak Park, northwest of Los Angeles, quadrupled in size in just hours, reports CBS News' John Blackstone. It's already burned dozens of homes and threatens 30,000 more. The conditions there are bone dry and erratic winds with speeds ranging from 20 to 55 mph are rapidly fanning the flames.\n\n\n\nThirty-thousand people have been evacuated so far and the number of evacuees is expected to rise as embers push ahead of the fire. One evacuation center was even forced to close down as the flames spread.\n\nAnother blaze just west of that area, dubbed the Hill Fire, topped 10,000 acres on Thursday. Hundreds of firefighters are still struggling to contain it. The devastation these communities are facing cannot be understated.", "", "", "", "There's a lot you can learn from looking at a person's tax return. You can tell how much a taxpayer gave to charity; what their sources of income are; whether they're married or divorced. You can learn how much or how little they made, whether they moved for a job and (sometimes) whether they have children.\n\nAt least, you can learn these things from looking at the tax returns of an ordinary worker. When it comes to President Donald Trump and taxpayers at his rarified income level, a tax return can deliver plenty of personal information but still lack some of the most tantalizing stuff -- their total net worth, for instance, or what real estate they own.\n\n\"I think [President Trump] is worried about two things: One, the income is probably lower than his pride will be able to deal with, and I think the charitable deductions will be way lower [than he has claimed]. I think that's going to be an embarrassing number for him,\" said Mark Matthews, an attorney at tax law firm Caplin & Drysdale. (Matthews, like all the tax attorneys consulted for this article, made his assessment based on media reports about Mr. Trump's wealth and his own knowledge of the tax code.)\n\nThe first billionaire president, who made his business acumen a focal point of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump now faces the prospect of a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives examining those claims through his tax documents. Accounting experts and tax attorneys told CBS MoneyWatch what Mr. Trump's tax returns might hold for Americans\u2014and what they won't show.\n\nWhat's in and what's out\n\n\"It's not so much about what's on the return that matters -- it's about what's not on the return,\" said Bruce Dubinsky, managing director of Disputes and Investigations at Duff & Phelps, a corporate advisory firm. If a taxpayer is known to own many business entities, like resorts, hotels or country clubs, those items should appear on the tax returns, he said.\n\nDubinsky, who said he has prepared about 10,000 tax returns for high-net-worth clients over his career, estimated that Mr. Trump's return at \"probably 200 to 300 pages long, with multiple schedules that have summary-level detail.\"\n\nSigning my tax return.... pic.twitter.com/XJfXeaORbU \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 15, 2015\n\nThe operative term here is \"summary.\" A tax return lists how much income a person made from a variety of sources, including a business, but it does not demand documentation to back up that figure. (If the IRS asks to see documents, that's a sign you're being audited.)\n\nMarriage or divorce\n\nUntil this year, taxpayers could deduct alimony payments from their income\u2014and seeing someone's payments, year over year, might provide a hint about their broader financial situation.\n\n\"If someone is receiving $2 million a year in alimony, it's a clue that the person paying it has at least that much coming in every year,\" said Dubinsky.\n\nMr. Trump reached alimony agreements with both of his ex-wives, which his tax returns could corroborate. They could also confirm or refute certain media reports, such as whether Mr. Trump ever made good on a reported threat to withhold alimony from Marla Maples, his second ex-wife.\n\nBroader details, such as the particulars of a divorce settlement, are another matter. Mr. Trump's two divorce settlements remain sealed.\n\nGifts to charity\n\nCharitable donations appear regularly on tax returns for the roughly 30 percent of Americans who itemize their deductions. The IRS form doesn't go into detail, however. There are only two lines: one for donations in cash or check, and another for donations made in any other form (such as donations of real estate, stock or art.)\n\nSuch a line would be a starting point to request tax returns from linked accounts\u2014such as foundations that received his contributions. And it would not necessarily be complete since there are ways to structure charitable donations that don't require an individual to report them. The Trump Foundation is shutting down, but Mr. Trump could also have charitable trusts, and those trusts' contributions to causes would not be reported on a tax return, said Dubinsky.\n\nGifts\u2014not to charity\n\nGift taxes, one line of inquiry used in The New York Times' recent investigation of Fred Trump's real estate empire, could be similarly fruitful for his son. Gift tax returns could, for instance, show whether Mr. Trump has given away any assets and whether he has placed any into trusts, said Beth Kaufman, an attorney at Caplin & Drysdale.\n\nThe IRS requires people to report gifts anytime they give away cash or goods valued at more than $15,000, and report it on a completely separate form from the 1040. The gift tax return is obscure enough that it's only a concern for the wealthy.\n\n\"Your run-of-the mill person never files one in their entire life; your millionaire or billionaire files one every year,\" Kaufman said.\n\nForeign income\n\nThe U.S. taxes income its citizens earn anywhere in the world, which means money earned abroad must be reported. Americans are also required to report foreign bank accounts to the Treasury.\n\nInterest earned on foreign bank accounts would also be reported as \"interest income\" on a tax return, though the form itself would not indicate if the interest income came from a domestic or foreign bank.\n\nFor owners of companies outside the U.S., it's more complicated. American owners of foreign corporation's aren't always required to report that income, Dubinsky said: \"If you own a hotel in Singapore, and that's set up as a foreign corporation, there are rules that maybe you don't need to report that income.\"\n\nForeign income reporting also runs into the same problem as before: It's income, not wealth. And finding out how much interest someone earned on an account won't tell you how much that account is worth. A return could show interest income of $100, \"but you don't know if that's one night's interest on a million dollars, or a year's interest on $3,000,\" as one attorney put it for CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nDeductions\n\nCharitable donations are the best-known, but taxpayers have a number of expenses they're allowed to deduct from income, reducing the taxes they pay. A loss from an investment or a business is one such deduction\u2014and Mr. Trump reported business losses on the partial tax returns for 1995 and 2005 that have become public. His 1995 loss, in particular, was listed at $916 million -- \"so huge that he could conceivably have used them to avoid paying any federal income taxes for nearly 20 years,\" CBS MoneyWatch previously reported.\n\nHigh medical expenses, the costs of moving for work, mortgage interest on buildings you directly own, and property taxes and local taxes could all count as deductions until recent changes under this year's GOP tax cuts. But they're not likely to appear on the president's tax returns, experts say, since much of his property is owned via more than 500 limited-liability corporations\u2014each of which has its own income, expenses and business records. Getting a full picture of business activity would require not just the tax returns from those LLCs but a complete accounting record as well.\n\nFor any congressional committee looking into the president's finances, Mr. Trump's tax returns would be just a starting point.\n\n\"They're going to have to dig down into returns filed by LLCs, partnership returns. Almost none of that is copied on [Mr.] Trump's returns,\" Kaufman said. \"I think there are going to be waves of requests to get into this.\"", "", "", "As 2017 starts drawing near its end, many retirees with IRAs face a deadline that's easy to overlook -- but can be costly if you do. If you're 70\u00bd and have a balance in an IRA, you must take the so-called required minimum distribution (RMD). If you don't take your RMD, you could face a stiff penalty.\n\nThere's one exception to this rule, and it's for anyone who turned 70 this year. In that case, you can delay taking the first RMD until April 1 of the year following the year you turn 70\u00bd . But it's often not wise to wait until the April deadline. If you do, you'll also have to take the RMD for 2019 in the same year, meaning you're on the hook for two RMDs -- the one you delayed from 2018 and one for 2019. Two RMDs in the same year could bump you into a higher tax bracket and increase what you owe Uncle Sam.\n\nYou'll want to make sure to take the required amount and not a penny less. Underwithdrawing can cost you. If you don't withdraw enough or fail to make your withdrawal on time, the IRS can levy a penalty of up to 50 percent of the difference between the amount you actually withdrew and the amount you should have taken out.\n\nThe minimum amount you must withdraw is specified in IRS Publication 590-B, which lists the factor to use, based on your age, for calculating the amount you must withdraw.\n\nA loophole for workplace retirement plans\n\nIf you're over age 70\u00bd and are still working, you're also subject to the RMD rules. However, you can put off distributions from your employer's retirement plans, such as a 401(k), while you're working. You can wait to start withdrawals from that plan until the later of April 1 following the year in which you reach age 70\u00bd or the year you actually retire. So if you remain working for an employer, even part-time, you don't have to take an RMD from that employer's retirement plan until after you retire.\n\nThis special rule doesn't apply to an IRA, and after-tax Roth IRAs are not subject to RMDs.\n\nSome advisers recommend that you sell shares of stocks, bonds or mutual funds by now if you face an RMD trigger. That way you'll be sure the proceeds from the sale will be available as cash that you can then use to make the RMD. This advice seems to imply (and most people think it does) that RMDs must be made in cash.\n\nBut that's not the case. You can actually take distributions from your IRA for any reason, not just RMDs, either in cash or \"in kind.\" This means you can distribute the actual shares of stock or mutual funds from an IRA and use them to satisfy your RMD.\n\nWhat to know about \"in-kind\" distributions\n\nThe advantages of using an in-kind distribution of shares is that it allows you to keep the amount of the distribution fully invested. If a specific stock's price is down or you believe it's undervalued, you might want to hold onto the shares and distribute them, instead of selling them to take a cash withdrawal.\n\nOf course, the market value of the shares on the date they were distributed from the IRA would be taxed as ordinary income (the same as for cash distributions). But any gain on the shares after the date of distribution would be taxed at capital gains tax rates.\n\nAnother advantage of taking an in-kind distribution is that you don't have to sell the position in your IRA and then buy it back in another account with the distributed cash. Avoiding these round-trip transactions will save a trade commission for each trade. In the case of shares of a mutual fund that charges a front-end load or a redemption fee, you'll avoid those charges as well when you take an in-kind distribution.\n\nFinally, if the mutual fund you own is closed to new investors, you may want to distribute the shares in-kind, instead of selling them in the IRA to raise cash for the RMD.\n\nThe downside of taking in-kind distributions is that if the position involved typically experiences significant price swings, you'll have to distribute a few extra shares to ensure that their value at the time of the distribution was sufficient to meet the RMD amount.", "NEWBURY PARK, Calif. -- A former track coach at Newbury Park High School in California says Ian David Long, the 28-year-old suspect in the Wednesday mass shooting at a Thousand Oaks bar, assaulted her while he was a student there.\n\nDominique Colell told CBS Los Angeles her \"jaw dropped\" when she saw Long identified at the suspect on the news.\n\n\"He attacked me. He attacked his high school track coach,\" Colell said. \"Who does that?\"\n\nAuthorities say Long, a former Marine combat veteran who had been stationed in Afghanistan, used a .45-caliber Glock handgun with an illegal, extra-capacity magazine in the shooting that left 12 dead. Witnesses said he first shot a security guard outside the bar and deployed smoke bombs before going in and aiming at employees and customers, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.\n\nLong, who lived with his mother in Newbury Park, then apparently killed himself.\n\nColell told CBS Los Angeles that Long groped and assaulted her over a cell phone while she was his high school track coach. Colell said it happened during practice when someone found a phone and she was trying to figure out who it belonged to.\n\nCBS LA\n\n\"Ian came up and started screaming at me that was his phone,\" said Colell. \"He just started grabbing me. He groped my stomach. He groped my butt. I pushed him off me and said 'for that \u2014 you're off the team.' \"\n\nColell said she didn't report the incident because she was encouraged by other coaches and the school to accept an apology to not ruin his future in the Marine Corps.\n\n\"I should have reported it then,\" Colell said.\n\nA school district spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS News.\n\nOfficials had previously implied that Long may have suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder because of his military background, but Colell says he showed signs of aggression before his military service. The Marine Corps said Long entered active duty in Los Angeles in August 2008 and served until March 2013. He ranked as a corporal in 2011 and his military occupational specialty was machine gunner, the Marine Corps said.\n\nVentura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said his department's mental health crisis team was called to Long's home in April for a disturbance call and concluded that Long did not need to be taken into custody under a \"5150\" order, an evaluation that determines whether a person needs to be involuntarily held for up to 72 hours because they are a threat to themselves or others.\n\nThe episode was thought to be possible PTSD, Dean said.\n\n\"There are hundreds of thousands of people with PTSD,\" said Colell. \"They don't go around shooting people. This kid was mentally disturbed in high school. There were signs and the administration knew it.\"\n\nAuthorities say they are still investigating a motive.", "NEW YORK \u2014 Federal health officials on Thursday reported the first death in an ongoing salmonella outbreak linked to raw turkey. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the death was in California but didn't have any immediate details.\n\nSince last November, the agency said 164 people have fallen ill in 35 states, with the most recent case being reported on Oct. 20.\n\nNo products have been recalled, and the agency hasn't recommended that people avoid turkey. But it said it believes the outbreak is widespread and ongoing, and it reminded people to properly cook and handle turkey with Thanksgiving approaching.\n\n\"We are still seeing new illnesses being reported on a weekly basis,\" said Colin Basler, an epidemiologist with the CDC.\n\nBasler noted there is a lag time between when a person gets sick and when the illness gets reported to health officials.

Metallic. The sound of hot engines ticking and pinging, decompressing after a long drive.\n\nBallantine Books\n\nWith silent efficiency, tank crewmen worked to rearm and refuel their tired Sherman tanks before the last hues of color fled the sky.\n\nCrouched behind the turret of the leftmost tank, Corporal Clarence Smoyer carefully shuttled 75mm shells into the waiting hands of the loader inside. It was a delicate job\u2014even the slightest clang could reveal their position to the enemy.\n\nClarence was twenty-one, tall and lean with a Roman nose and a sea of curly blond hair under a knit cap. His blue eyes were gentle, but guarded. Despite his height, he was not a fighter\u2014he had never been in a fistfight. Back home in Pennsylvania he had hunted only once\u2014for rabbit\u2014and even that he did halfheartedly. Three weeks earlier he'd been promoted to gunner, second in command on the tank. It wasn't a promotion he had wanted.\n\nThe platoon was in place. To Clarence's right, four more olive-drab tanks were fanned out, \"coiled,\" in a half-moon formation with twenty yards between each vehicle. Farther to the north, beyond sight, was Mons, a city made lavish by the Industrial Revolution. A dirt road lay parallel to the tanks on the left, and it ran up through the darkening fields to a forested ridge, where the sun was setting behind the trees.\n\nThe Germans were out there, but how many there were and when they'd arrive, no one knew. It had been nearly three months since D-Day, and now Clarence and the men of the 3rd Armored Division were behind enemy lines.\n\nAll guns faced west.\n\nBoasting 390 tanks at full strength, the division had dispersed every operational tank between the enemy and Mons, blocking every road junction they could reach.\n\nSurvival that night would hinge on teamwork. Clarence's company headquarters had given his platoon, 2nd Platoon, a simple but important mission: guard the road, let nothing pass.\n\nBallantine Books\n\nClarence lowered himself through the commander's hatch and into the turret, a tight fit for a six-foot man. He slipped to the right of the gun breech and into the gunner's seat, leaning into his periscopic gun sight. As he had no hatch of his own, this five-inch-wide relay of glass prisms and a 3x telescopic gun sight mounted to the left of it would be his windows to the world.\n\nHis field of fire was set.\n\nThere would be no stepping out that night; it was too risky even to urinate. That's what they saved empty shell casings for.\n\nBeneath Clarence's feet, the tank opened up in the hull, with its white enamel walls like the turret's and a trio of dome lights. In the bow, the driver and bow gunner/assistant driver slid their seats backward to sleep where they had ridden all day. On the opposite side of the gun breech from Clarence, the loader stretched a sleeping bag on the turret floor. The tank smelled of oil, gunpowder, and a locker room, but the scent was familiar, even comforting. Ever since they'd come ashore, three weeks after D-Day, this M4A1 Sherman had been their home in Easy Company, 32nd Armor Regiment, of the 3rd Armored Division, one of the army's two heavy tank divisions.\n\nTonight, sleep would come quickly. The men were exhausted. The 3rd Armored had been charging for eighteen days at the head of the First Army, leading two other divisions in the breakout across northern France. Paris had been liberated, the Germans were running back the way they'd come in 1940, and the 3rd Armored was earning its nom de guerre: the Spearhead Division.\n\nThen came new orders.\n\nThe reconnaissance boys had spotted the German Fifteenth and Seventeenth Armies moving to the north, hightailing it out of France for Belgium and on course to pass through Mons's many crossroads. So the 3rd Armored turned on a dime and raced north\u2014107 miles in two days\u2014arriving just in time to lay an ambush.\n\nThe tank commander dropped into the turret and lowered the split hatch covers, leaving just a crack for air. He slumped into his seat behind Clarence, his boyish face still creased by the impression of his goggles. Staff Sergeant Paul Faircloth of Jacksonville, Florida, was also twenty-one, quiet and easygoing, with a sturdy build, black hair, and olive skin. Some assumed he was French or Italian, but he was half Cherokee. As the platoon sergeant, Paul had been checking on the other crews and positioning them for the night. Normally the platoon leader would do this, but their lieutenant was a new replacement and still learning the ropes.\n\nBallantine Books\n\nFor two days Paul had been on his feet in the commander's position, standing halfway out of his hatch with the turret up to his ribs. From there he could anticipate the column's movements to help the driver brake and steer. In the event of a sudden halt\u2014when another crew threw a track or got mired in mud, for instance\u2014Paul was always the first out of the tank to help.\n\n\"I'm taking your watch tonight,\" Clarence said. \"I'll do a double.\"\n\nBallantine Books\n\nThe offer was generous, but Paul resisted\u2014he could handle it.\n\nClarence persisted until Paul threw up his hands and finally swapped places with him to nab some shut-eye in the gunner's seat.\n\nClarence took the commander's position, a seat higher in the turret. The hatch covers were closed enough to block a German grenade, but open enough to provide a good view to the front and back. He could see his neighboring Sherman through the rising moonlight. The tank's squat, bulbous turret looked incongruous against the tall, sharp lines of the body, as if the parts had been pieced together from salvage.\n\nClarence snatched a Thompson submachine gun from the wall and chambered a round. For the next four hours, enemy foot soldiers were his concern. Everyone knew that German tankers didn't like to fight at night.\n\n\n\nPartway through Clarence's watch, the darkness came alive with a mechanical rumbling.\n\nThe moon was smothered by clouds and he couldn't see a thing, but he could hear a convoy of vehicles moving beyond the tree-lined ridge.\n\nStart and stop. Start and stop.\n\nThe radio speaker on the turret wall kept humming with static. No flares illuminated the sky. The 3rd Armored would later estimate there were 30,000 enemy troops out there, mostly men of the German Army, the Wehrmacht, with some air force and navy personnel among them\u2014yet no order came to give pursuit or attack.\n\nThat's because the battered remnants of the enemy armies were bleeding precious fuel as they searched for a way around the roadblocks, and Spearhead was content to let them wander. The enemy was desperately trying to reach the safety of the West Wall, also known as the Siegfried Line, a stretch of more than 18,000 defensive fortifications that bristled along the German border.\n\nIf these 30,000 troops could dig in there, they could bar the way to Germany and prolong the war. They had to be stopped, here, at Mons, and Spearhead had a plan for that\u2014but it could wait until daylight.\n\n\n\nAround two a.m. the distinctive slap of tank tracks arose from the distant rumble.\n\nClarence tracked the sounds\u2014vehicles were coming down the road in front of him. He knew his orders\u2014let nothing pass\u2014but doubt was setting in. Maybe this was a reconnaissance patrol returning? Had someone gotten lost? They couldn't be British, not in this area. Whoever they were, he wasn't about to pull the trigger on friendly forces.\n\nOne after the other, three tanks clanked past the blacked-out Shermans and kept going, and Clarence began to breathe again.\n\nThen one of the tanks let off the gas. It began turning and squeaking, as if its tracks were in need of oil. The sound was unmistakable. Only full-metal tracks sounded like that, and a Sherman's were padded with rubber.\n\nThe tanks were German.\n\nClarence didn't move. The tank was behind him, then beside him. It slowed and sputtered then squeaked to a stop in the middle of the coiled Shermans. Clarence braced for a flash and the flames that would swallow him. The German tank was idling alongside him. He'd never even hear the gun bark. He would just cease to exist.\n\nBallantine Books\n\nA whisper shook Clarence from his paralysis. It was Paul. Without a word, Clarence slipped back into the gunner's seat and Paul took over.\n\nClarence strapped on his tanker's helmet. Made of fiber resin, it looked like a cross between a football helmet and a crash helmet, and had goggles on the front and headphones sewn into leather earflaps. He clipped a throat microphone around his neck and plugged into the intercom.*\n\n[*A WWII tanker's helmet was in fact patterned after a 1930s-era football helmet and carried the manufacturer's stamp of sporting goods companies such as Rawlings, A. G. Spalding & Bros., and Wilson Athletic Goods.]\n\nOn the other side of the turret, the loader sat up, wiping the sleep from his eyes.\n\nClarence mouthed the words German tank. The loader snapped wide-awake.\n\nFrom his hatch, Paul tapped Clarence on the right shoulder, the signal to turn the turret to the right.\n\nClarence hesitated. The turret wasn't silent, what if the Germans heard it?\n\nPaul tapped again.\n\nClarence relented and turned a handle, the turret whined, gears cranked, and the gun swept the dark.\n\nWhen the gun was aligned broadside, Paul stopped Clarence. Clarence pressed his eyes to his periscope. Everything below the skyline was inky black.\n\nClarence told Paul he couldn't see a thing and suggested they call in armored infantrymen to kill the tank with a bazooka.\n\nPaul couldn't chance some jittery soldier blasting the wrong tank. He grabbed his hand microphone\u2014nicknamed \"the pork chop\" due to its shape\u2014and dialed the radio to the platoon frequency, alerting the other crews to what they likely already knew: that an enemy tank was in the coil. In a Sherman platoon at that time, only the tanks of the platoon leader and platoon sergeant could transmit. Everyone else could only listen.\n\n\"No noise, and no smoking cigarettes,\" Paul said. \"We'll take care of him.\"\n\nWe'll take care of him? Clarence was horrified. He had hardly used the gun in daylight and now Paul wanted him to fire in pitch-darkness, at what? A sound? An enemy he couldn't see?\n\nHe wished he could return to being a loader. A loader never saw much. Never did much. On a tank crew, the loader was pretty much just along for the ride. That was the good life. A gentle giant, Clarence simply wanted to slip through the war without killing anyone or getting killed himself.\n\nNo time for that. The German tank crew had likely realized their mistake by now.\n\n\"Gunner, ready?\"\n\nPanicked, Clarence turned and tugged on Paul's pant leg.\n\nPaul sank into the turret, exasperated. Clarence rattled off his doubts. What if he missed? What if he got a deflection and hit their own guys?\n\nPaul's voice calmed Clarence: \"Somebody has to take the shot.\"\n\nAs if the Germans had been listening, they suddenly cut their power. The hot engine hissed, then went silent.\n\nClarence felt a wave of relief. It was a reprieve. Paul must have been biting his lip in anger, because he said nothing at first. Finally, he informed the crew that now they would have to wait to fire at first light.\n\nClarence's relief faded. His indecision had cost them whatever advantage they'd had. And against a German tank, they'd need every advantage they could get, especially if they were facing a Panther, the tank of nightmares. Some GIs called it \"the Pride of the Wehrmacht,\" and rumor had it that a Panther could shoot through one Sherman and into a second, and its frontal armor was supposedly impervious.\n\nThat July, the U.S. Army had placed several captured Panthers in a field in Normandy and blasted away at them with the same 75mm gun as in Clarence's Sherman. The enemy tanks proved vulnerable from the flanks and rear, but not the front. Not a single shot managed to penetrate the Panther's frontal armor, from any distance.\n\nClarence checked his luminescent watch, knowing the Germans were probably doing the same. The countdown had begun. Someone was going to die.\n\n\n\nThe loader fell asleep over the gun breech.\n\nThree a.m. became four a.m.\n\nClarence and Paul passed a canteen of cold coffee back and forth. They had always joked that they were a family locked in a sardine can. And like a family, they didn't always see eye to eye. Unlike Paul, who was always running off to help someone outside the tank, all Clarence cared about was his family on the inside\u2014him and his crew.\n\nThis had been his way since childhood.\n\nGrowing up in industrial Lehighton, Pennsylvania, Clarence lived in a row house by the river, with walls so flimsy he could hear the neighbors. His parents were usually out working to keep the family afloat. His father did manual labor for the Civilian Conservation Corps and his mother was a housekeeper.\n\nWith the family's survival at stake, Clarence was determined to contribute. When other kids played sports or did homework, twelve-year-old Clarence stacked a ballpark vendor's box with candy bars and went selling door-to-door throughout Lehighton. Just a boy, he had vowed: I've got to take care of my family because no one is going to take care of us.\n\nClarence checked his periscope. To the east, a faint tinge of purple colored the horizon.\n\nHe kept his eyes glued to the glass until a blocky shape appeared about fifty yards away.\n\n\"I see it,\" he whispered.\n\nPaul rose to his hatch and saw it too. It looked like a rise of rock, highest at the midpoint. Clarence turned handwheels to fine-tune his aim.\n\nPaul urged him to hurry. If they could see the enemy, the enemy could see them.\n\nClarence settled the reticle, as the gun sight's crosshairs were known, on the \"rock\" at center mass and reported that he was ready. His boot hovered over the trigger, a button on the footrest.\n\n\"Fire,\" Paul said.\n\nClarence's foot stamped down.\n\nOutside, a massive flash leapt from the Sherman's barrel, momentarily illuminating the tanks\u2014an olive-drab American and a sandy-yellow German\u2014both facing the same direction.\n\nSparks burst from the darkness and a sound like an anvil strike pierced the countryside. Inside the turret, without the fan operating, smoke hung thick in the air. Clarence's ears throbbed and his eyes stung, but he kept them pressed to his sight.\n\nThe loader chambered a new shell. Clarence again hovered his foot over the trigger.\n\n\"Nothing's moving,\" Paul said from above. A broadside at this range? It was undoubtedly a kill shot.\n\nThe intercom came alive with voices of relief, and Clarence moved his foot away from the trigger.\n\nPaul radioed the platoon; the job was done.\n\nThrough his periscope, Clarence watched the sky warm beneath the dark clouds, revealing the boxy armor and the 11-foot, 8-inch long gun of a Panzer IV tank.\n\nKnown by the Americans as the Mark IV, the design was old, in service since 1938, and it had been the enemy's most prevalent tank until that August, when the Panther began taking over. But even though it was no longer the mainstay, the Mark IV was still lethal. Its 75mm gun packed 25 percent more punch than Clarence's.\n\nMore light revealed the tank's dark green-and-brown swirls of camouflage and the German cross on the flank. Clarence had nearly placed his shot right on it.\n\n\"Think they're in there?\" One of the crewmen posed the question, seeing that the Mark IV's hatch covers hadn't budged.\n\nClarence envisioned a tank full of moaning, bleeding men and hoped the crew had slipped out in the night. He had no love for the Germans, but he hated the idea of killing any human being. He wasn't about to look inside his first tank kill. A shell can ricochet like a supersonic pinball within the tight quarters, and he'd seen maintenance guys go inside to clean and come out crying after discovering brains on the ceiling.\n\n\"I'll go.\" Paul unplugged his helmet.\n\nClarence tried to dissuade him. It wasn't worth looking inside and getting his head blown off by a German.\n\nPaul brushed away the concerns and radioed the platoon to hold their fire.\n\nThrough his periscope, Clarence watched Paul climb the Mark IV's hull and creep toward the turret with his Thompson at the ready. With one hand steadying his gun, Paul opened the commander's hatch and aimed the Thompson inside.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nHe leaned forward and took a long look, then shouldered his gun.\n\nPaul sealed the hatch shut.\n\n\n\nExcerpted from \"Spearhead: the World War II Odyssey of an American Tank Gunner.\" Copyright \u00a9 2018 by Adam Makos.

Most astronomers believe Oumuamua \u2013 Hawaiian for \"messenger\" or \"scout\" \u2013 is a comet or an asteroid, except a half a mile long. But there are things about its behavior they can't quite explain. Enter two Harvard scientists with an idea even they admit is a little out there, reports CBS News correspondent Tony Dokoupil.\n\nWhen Oumuamua was discovered last October, it was tumbling past the sun at 196,000 mph. To some the reddish object looked like a cigar. Others thought it was shaped like a pancake.\n\n\n\n\"It looks very different from objects that we have found in the solar system,\" said Avi Loeb, chair of the Harvard University astronomy department. Loeb said Oumuamua did not behave like an ordinary asteroid or give off gas like a comet.\n\n\"There seemed to be an extra force that is pushing it, and it's not clear what this push is from,\" he added.\n\nIn an upcoming paper, he and colleague offer what they call a \"more exotic scenario... Oumuamua may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to earth vicinity by an alien civilization.\"\n\nAccording to their calculations, Oumuamua is less than a millimeter thin, but very wide like a sail, harnessing solar radiation to propel itself \u2013 similar to the spaceship used by Count Dooku in the \"Star Wars\" films.\n\n\"I just want everybody to take that with a gigantic grain of salt,\" said Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History. She said Oumuamua didn't emit any signals suggesting it was a space craft.\n\n\"If you say that the top 10 list of explanations does not include alien probe, what is on that list of top 10 explanations?\" Dokoupil asked.\n\n\"It's a comet. Or an asteroid. Or a rock,\" Faherty said.\n\n\"So where is alien civilization on the list of explanations?\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't know. Real low. Real low. Real, real low,\" Faherty said.\n\nFaherty doubts Oumuamua's appearance means we're on the verge of an alien encounter like the one in the movie, \"Arrival.\"\n\n\"Oumuamua, as it stands, is a phenomenal discovery and a really important object for astronomers to study and for the public to get excited about,\" Faherty said. \"It's OK that it's not aliens.\"\n\n\n\nOumuamua is now so far away we can no longer see it with our satellites. Faherty did have a theory on why we keep coming up with these exotic explanations: As hard as it is to fathom the existence of aliens, it's apparently even harder to fathom the idea that we're alone.\n\n", "We take our music seriously at \"CBS This Morning.\" Keep up with the music we play on the broadcast by following our \"CBS This Morning\" Spotify playlist and checking CBSThisMorning.com for daily playlist posts.\n\n\"Heartbreak Warfare\" \u2013 John Mayer\n\n\"Message Man\" \u2013 Twenty One Pilots\n\n\"A-Punk\" \u2013 Vampire Weekend\n\n\"Suddenly I See\" \u2013 KT Tunstall\n\n\"Thunder Clatter\" \u2013 Wild Cub\n\n\"Swim\" \u2013 Jack's Mannequin\n\n\"Nobody Knows\" \u2013 The Lumineers\n\n\"Counting Stars\" \u2013 OneRepublic\n\n\"Just Like Heaven\" \u2013 The Cure\n\n\"Speed Of Sound\" \u2013 Coldplay\n\n\"Good Vibrations\" \u2013 Marky Mark And The Funky Bunch, Loleatta Holloway\n\n\"Dark Blue\" \u2013 Jack's Mannequin\n\n\"Satellite\" \u2013 Dave Matthews Band", "", "We take our music seriously at \"CBS This Morning.\" Keep up with the music we play on the broadcast by following our \"CBS This Morning\" Spotify playlist and checking CBSThisMorning.com for daily playlist posts.\n\n\"Heavenly\" \u2013Pale Waves\n\n\"This Morning\" \u2013 Picture This\n\n\"Helpless\" \u2013 John Mayer\n\n\"Take Me Down\" \u2013 Gary Clark Jr.\n\n\"So Fresh, So Clean\" \u2013 OutKast\n\n\"Live In The Moment\" \u2013 Portugal.

Claire Busby, 46, suffered severe spinal injuries when she fell off her bed in 2013. She accused bed seller \"Beds Are Uzzzz\" of selling her a bed with missing pieces, which she said caused her to fall.\n\nHigh Court Judge Barry Cotter ruled on Friday that the case was a \"tragic accident,\" caused by, \"a most unfortunate and unusual combination of positioning on the bed and movement.\"\n\nCotter rejected Busby's case against the Berkshire Bed Company, which runs the Beds Are Uzzz store, finding that the bed was \"not defective.\"\n\nBusby had told the court she was kneeling on the bed during sex with her partner and that when she went to change positions she \"swung her legs\" out from underneath her, and the bed gave way.\n\n\"I spun around, I put my hand down and then I felt like I was catapulted off the back,\" she said, according to CBS News partner network BBC News. \"I fell to the side and heard what felt like a spring in my body snap.\"\n\nBusby argued that the super-king sized bed, formed of two base pieces called divans, had come without a pair of casters, leaving it angled downward toward the foot of the bed. She was seeking \u00a31 million (about $1.3 million) in damages from the bed company.\n\nBut Judge Cotter found that the slight decline couldn't be blamed for Busby's topple backwards.\n\n\"Having carefully considered the totality of the evidence I am not satisfied that the difference in level between the two divans played any part in Ms Busby's loss of balance,\" the judge said. \"Rather, I am satisfied that this was a simple but tragic fall; she simply overbalanced probably in part because she was sitting on a mattress as opposed to a firm surface, and underestimated the amount of give underneath her body.\"", "", "", "President Trump, en route to Paris for the Armistice Day celebration, told reporters he's never spoken with controversial Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\n\"I didn't speak to Matt Whitaker\" about special counsel Robert Mueller, the president said, claiming he \"didn't know\" Whitaker but that he is \"highly thought of.\"\n\nThe president's trip to Paris comes after a contentious midterm election that Mr. Trump declared a tremendous victory, and after he ousted his attorney general Jeff Sessions and named Whitaker acting attorney general.\n\nHe also commented on his latest move to tighten the nation's asylum rules, saying, \"We want people to come into our country, but they have to come into the country legally.\" On Thursday the administration posted an interim final rule that would withhold asylum protection from immigrants who first cross the border illegally.\n\nAs he left town, there remained several undecided high-profile races, including the Florida gubernatorial and Senate contests. The tally is still coming in from Palm Beach and Broward counties, and Mr. Trump did not rule out a federal role in potential recounts. \"Could be,\" he told reporters, and he mentioned a \"horrible history\" in Broward and declared \"we won easily.\" Rick Scott is locked in a tight race with incumbent Bill Nelson, and Todd Gillum's race against Ron DeSantis is also undecided.\n\nThe president is expected to arrive in Paris later Friday afternoon.", "", "The Trump administration is placing new restrictions on immigrants seeking U.S. asylum, but some advocates say the move violates federal law. The mandate, targeting a caravan of Central Americans moving toward the border and announced on Thursday, declares that anyone crossing the southern border illegally will be ineligible for asylum.\n\nCBS News' Mireya Villarreal was with army troops all day Thursday as they put up barbed wire fencing at the border. But just 20 feet behind that barbed wire is the border wall, which has some locals questioning what exactly a four-foot barrier will do that the wall and agents can't.\n\nIn less than a week, the U.S. military turned nearly 40 acres of barren land in the small border town of Donna, Texas, into a fully operational military base.\n\n\"So really what it takes is a lot of teamwork to make something like this run,\" said Captain Lauren Blanton, who helps run the base.\n\nMore than 600 soldiers staff the base, set up by the Trump administration to support Customs and Border Protection agents. In the middle of the base there's a makeshift parking lot that's been created for the dozens of military vehicles there including cargo trucks, Humvees \u2013 anything that can go into the rural parts of the Rio Grande Valley. From what we know, more are still coming.\n\nThe camp is a fortress equipped with massive housing tents and endless yards of barbed wire fence. It also features a fully functioning hospital that 1st Lieutenant Lee Dimaculangan said can hold up to four trauma patients, but could be expanded. According to Dimaculangan, they'll have four physicians, two PA's and a nurse on hand.\n\nIn part, the personnel there are preparing for a migrant caravan expected to arrive at the border before year's end. It consists of roughly 5,000 asylum-seekers from Central American countries.\n\nCritics have accused President Trump of using the military move as a political stunt. Captain Blanton said that kind of talk matters to the soldiers stationed there.\n\n\"That matters and if it matters to the American citizens, we are too. So in the same way we ask every informed citizen to go and do research, ask questions, listen to what's going on and then have a real conversation, we ask our soldiers to do that as well,\" Blanton said.\n\nMore than 5,600 troops right now are stationed along the U.S.-Mexico border.", "", "", "bad url", "", "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Prospects have improved for Congress to pass a bipartisan farm bill before the end of the year after Democrats secured the House majority during the midterm elections, a key lawmaker and other experts said.\n\nWork requirements for food stamps, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, had been the biggest stumbling block holding up an agreement. The version that narrowly passed the House with no Democratic votes includes the tougher rules. The bipartisan version that won easy Senate approval does not, and few Senate Republicans want them.\n\nObservers say it's likely that House Republicans will now be ready to pass a compromise in the upcoming lame duck session rather than starting over in a Democratic-controlled House and risking a result they would like even less.\n\n\"There isn't any reason why this thing can't get done,\" said Rep. Collin Peterson, of Minnesota, the ranking Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee and the likely chairman next year. \"The only thing I care about between now and the end of the year is getting this farm bill done.\"\n\nFarm bills traditionally set federal agricultural and food policy for five years. While they include safety net programs for farmers, nutrition programs including SNAP are most of the spending. The current law expires at the end of the year. While Peterson might have even more influence on shaping the legislation as chairman, he told The Associated Press that he doesn't want to wait, given how hard farmers have been hit by low prices and trade disputes.\n\n\"The farmers need certainty,\" he said. \"They're facing some of the toughest times we've had for a long time. The last thing they need is not knowing what the farm bill is going to be.\"\n\nRepublicans would have kept pushing hard for the work requirements if they'd retained control of the House, said Marin Bozic, a professor of applied economics and agricultural policy expert at the University of Minnesota. But the impending Democratic takeover, including Peterson's expected rise to the chairmanship, have changed the dynamics, Bozic said.\n\nPeterson said he spoke this week with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and the current House Agriculture Committee chairman, Michael Conaway, as well as key senators, and those conversations left him optimistic about getting their remaining differences resolved.\n\nConaway, a Texas Republican, has said little publicly, and his spokeswoman said he was not available for an interview Thursday. But he put out a statement Wednesday that said: \"This week's election results don't change the circumstances in farm country. I remain 100 percent committed to completing the farm bill this year.\"\n\nPresident Trump said at a news conference Wednesday that he still wants the stricter work requirements.\n\n\"Everybody wants it, the farmers want it, but the Democrats are not approving the farm bill with work rules,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We could have it very fast without the work rules, but we want the work rules in and the Democrats just don't want to vote for that. So at some point, they'll have to pay maybe a price.\"\n\nBut Peterson said Perdue did not say during their conversation Tuesday night that Mr. Trump would veto a version that lacked stricter work requirements. He said SNAP already has work requirements, but many states have been granted waivers, and a compromise could include tightening the waiver rules.\n\nMajor farm groups made fresh calls this week for lawmakers to finish the job this year. Paul Bleiberg, vice president of government relations for the National Milk Producers Federation, said the tone from all the key players and everything else he's hearing is that \"they're pretty intent on getting it done by the end of the year. ... I don't think anyone wants it to linger in the coming year.\"\n\nThe prevailing attitude on Capitol Hill and among farm groups, Bleiberg said, is: \"You've gotten this far. Who wants to hit the reset button now?\"", "Seniors in many states will be able to receive additional services such as help with chores, safety devices and respite for caregivers next year through private \"Medicare Advantage\" insurance plans.\n\nIt's a harbinger of potentially big changes for Medicare, reflecting a growing recognition that simple help at home can have a meaningful impact on patients' well-being \u2014 and reduce some costs for taxpayers. A couple of hundred dollars to install grab bars in the shower can prevent a fall leading to a broken hip, a life-changing injury.\n\nThe newly covered services are similar to what people might need if they required long-term care, said Howard Gleckman, a senior researcher at the nonpartisan Urban Institute think tank. \"It begins to break down the wall between long-term care and Medicare, which with very few exceptions, has never paid for long-term care.\"\n\nChange is starting slowly, which may make it tough for seniors to find plans that offer the services. The services will be offered by some Medicare Advantage plans in about 20 states next year, expected to grow over time.\n\nAbout 780,000 beneficiaries will have access to the new benefits next year, or a fraction of the 23 million Medicare beneficiaries with Advantage plans. In-home helpers and support for caregivers are the most popular.\n\nThere has to be a health-related reason to qualify, and costs will vary among plans. In some plans, there's no added cost. But limits do apply. For example, a plan may cover one day per week at an adult day care center.\n\nMore than 1 in 3 Medicare recipients are expected to be covered by a Medicare Advantage plan next year. The private plans generally offer lower out-of-pocket costs in exchange for limits on choice of doctors and hospitals and other restrictions such as prior authorization for services. It's a growing business for insurers.\n\nMedicare Advantage open enrollment for 2019 ends Dec. 7, providing seniors with a chance to make changes to their health care coverage. For instance, experts recommend that seniors make sure they are covering their coverage gaps with supplement plans or an Advantage plan.\n\nBut it's not easy to use Medicare's online plan finder to search for plans with expanded benefits, so beneficiaries and their families will have to rely on promotional materials that insurers mail during open enrollment.\n\nFor years, Medicare has permitted private plans to offer supplemental benefits not covered by the traditional program. Think free gym memberships, transportation to medical appointments or home-delivered meals following a hospitalization.\n\nMajor insurers\n\nThe new benefits take that to a higher level, with Medicare's blessing.\n\n\"It is a big concept, in the sense that it is officially encouraging plans to get across the line into the many, many things that affect the health and well-being of beneficiaries,\" said Marc Russo, president of insurer Anthem's Medicare business. \"I, for one, who have been in and around Medicare for decades, believe it pays.\"\n\nInsurers under Anthem's corporate umbrella are offering different packages in 12 of 21 states they operate in. They can include alternative medicine, like acupuncture, or adult day care center visits or a personal helper at home.\n\nOther major insurers like UnitedHealthcare and Humana are participating.\n\nStill, Medicare's opening is no substitute for full long-term care coverage, which many people need for at least part of their lives and remains prohibitively expensive. Seniors trying to get long-term care through Medicaid \u2014 the program for low-income people \u2014 must spend down their life savings.\n\n\"Medicare policy has not kept up with the times,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., one of the authors of bipartisan legislation seen as a catalyst for expanded services through Medicare Advantage.\n\nWyden said he's working to bring similar options to traditional Medicare, which is still the choice of 2 out of 3 seniors. \"Clearly this is going to have to be an effort that is going to have to be built out,\" he added.\n\nThe changes represent a rare consensus at a time when health care issues are among the most politically divisive. Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as Seema Verma, the Trump administration's Medicare chief, are pulling in the same direction.\n\nThe idea of broader services through Medicare Advantage was embodied in a bipartisan Senate Finance Committee bill to improve care for chronically ill seniors. The legislation got spliced into a massive budget bill passed earlier this year. The Trump administration issued regulations in the spring trying to accelerate the changes.\n\nAccording to Medicare, 12 insurers will be offering expanded supplemental benefits next year through 160 plans in 20 states. In four other states and Puerto Rico, such benefits may be available to seniors with certain health conditions.\n\n\"The guidance came out fairly late in the annual planning process, and that's one reason why some of these benefits may start out small,\" said Steve Warner, head of Medicare Advantage program development for UnitedHealthcare.\n\nConsumer advocates recommend that seniors carefully weigh whether Medicare Advantage is best for them. If they don't like it, they can go back to traditional Medicare, but those with a pre-existing condition may not be able to buy a \"Medigap\" policy to help cover out-of-pocket costs. They can also switch to another Medicare Advantage plan.\n\nMedicare doesn't pay the insurers more for offering added benefits. Under a complex formula, they're primarily financed out of the difference between bids submitted by insurers and Medicare's maximum payment to plans. If the companies bid below Medicare's rate, they can return some of that to beneficiaries in the form of added benefits. Costs for beneficiaries may vary. Some will face no added costs.", "If you're searching for the best Neapolitan pizza in the world, you'd probably head to Naples, Italy. After all, it is the birthplace of the namesake pie known for its San Marzano tomatoes and mozzarella di bufala. But now some of the world's tastiest pizza is being made in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nTsubasa Tamaki is a pizza maker who has never set foot in Italy. \"Of course, I would like to visit Italy,\" said Tamaki. \"But in my mind, I want to focus on creating Japanese Neapolitan pizza.\"\n\nCBS News\n\n\"What makes your pizza Japanese-style?\" asked correspondent Ben Tracy.\n\n\"Giving the pizza a salt punch is Japanese-style,\" he replied.\n\nTamaki throws the salt directly into the oven, where it bakes into the dough, enhancing the flavor. He also pushes his pizzas closer to the fire than the Italians do, in search of the perfect char.\n\nCBS News\n\nHis oven is heated to a searing 900\u00b0, resulting in pies that are too hot to handle if you're in a hurry.\n\nBut what really sets Tamaki's pizza apart is the handful of Japanese cedar chips he tosses in at the last minute, which smoke the oven and glaze the dough with a slight bitterness.\n\nTracy said, \"I'm one of those guys who don't eat the crust; I eat the whole thing, then leave the crust. But when I came here and ate your pizza, I ate the whole crust. It's so good!\"\n\n\"Arigato!\" Tamaki laughed. \"That's exactly the way I want it, for you to eat every last morsel.\"\n\nJust 10 months after Tamaki opened the doors of Pizza Studio Tamaki (or PST) last year, the famed Michelin guide was already recommending his pizza. Perhaps more importantly, it's kid-tested and mother-approved.\n\n\"I never thought I would say this coming from close to New York, in New Jersey,\" said one woman. \"I think pizza here in Tokyo is better than a lot of the places in the U.S.\"\n\n\"Them's fighting words,\" said Tracy.\n\n\"They are fighting words, you're right!\"\n\nCraig Mod is a writer who has been spreading the word about the new wave of Japanese pizza. \"When I first found Tamaki, it was a total revelation,\" he said. \"Friends would visit from New York and I'd say, 'I know you are in Tokyo, but trust me, let's go have a pizza.' And they'd go, 'C'mon, let's go get ramen, let's go get sushi.' We'd sit at the counter, Tamaki would serve us our pizza, and they would just be speechless.\"\n\nCBS News\n\nTracy asked, \"Is there something culturally here \u2013 the exactness, the striving for perfection \u2013 that is making this work?\"\n\n\"Japan has a history and a culture of valuing commitment as a way of defining success \u2013 not necessarily connecting success with making the most number of pizzas, but making the best pizzas as well as you can make them,\" Mod replied.\n\nBut if Tokyo has become an unlikely pizza mecca, it's thanks largely to a restaurant that opened more than two decades ago, called Seirinkan. Its owner, Susumu Kakinuma, studied pizza making in Naples and brought it home to Tokyo. To this day, he serves only the original \"M & M\"s: margherita and marinara.\n\nCBS News\n\n\"Learning was a pleasure,\" Kakinuma said. \"Pizza is really like playing music. Mozzarella, tomato and basil form a melody.\" it's a metaphor he takes literally at the end of each day, banging on a drum set in the basement of his restaurant.\n\nKakinuma is considered the godfather of Tokyo's pizza culture, and has now trained many of the city's top pizza makers. He also inspired Tamaki, who worked at one of his restaurants before deciding he finally had the skills to open his Pizza Studio.\n\nTracy asked Tamaki, \"Do you think the Japanese or the Italians are making better pizza?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure I should answer this!\" he laughed. \"This is all I know: If Italian was tastier, I'd be making it.\"\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Lucy Craft.", "", "", "", "PHOENIX \u2014 As the Arizona Senate vote count starts to tip into Democratic terrain, a judge Friday will hear a lawsuit by the GOP seeking to limit the tally -- or expand it in the state's conservative-leaning rural areas.\n\nFour local Republican parties filed a lawsuit Wednesday night challenging the state's two biggest counties for allowing voters to help resolve problems with their mail-in ballot signatures after Election Day. If the signature on the voter registration doesn't match that on the sealed envelope, both Maricopa and Pima County allow voters to help them fix, or \"cure\" it, up to five days after Election Day.\n\nMany other counties only allow voters to cure until polls close on Election Day.\n\nOnly a few thousand votes would be affected by the suit, but every one counts in the razor-close U.S. Senate race between Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Rep. Martha McSally. On Thursday, Sinema jumped into a minuscule lead of about 9,000 out of 1.9 million votes counted after trailing since Tuesday. Her lead came from the two counties singled out by Republicans in their lawsuit, Maricopa and Pima Counties.\n\nThe race remained too close to call with at least 400,000 ballots still uncounted. Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes said counting may continue until Nov. 15. \"We know there's urgency out there, but we want to get it right, not quick,\" he said.\n\nArizona is notoriously slow at tallying ballots even though about 75 percent of votes are cast by mail. Each of those ballots must go through a laborious verification process.\n\nIf the signature on the envelope does not match the signature on the voter file, elections officials can contact the voter to try to resolve the discrepancy. Such situations arise, for example, when voters have Parkinson's disease and can no longer sign as they did in the past or as their signature changes over the years.\n\nThe GOP lawsuit centers on that \"cure\" process. It asks that the judge either stop Maricopa and Pima from contacting voters to fix their ballots after Election Day or permit the rest of the state to do it. At least two other rural counties also allow post-Election Day \"cures\" but several others do not.\n\nAttorney Brett Johnson said in an interview the party would be happy if the end result is more votes counted. \"At the end of the day, each vote should be treated the same way,\" Johnson said.\n\nAt a brief hearing Thursday, a Maricopa County official said only about 5,600 ballots are at issue in her county and the rate is similar in the 14 smaller counties. More than 2.2 million votes were cast statewide.\n\nThere were more than 600,000 mail-in ballots left to process statewide as of Wednesday, about 75 percent in Maricopa County. That huge amount has put pressure on a system that spends a lot of time already verifying the mail ballot signatures.\n\nFontes said his office's 1980s-era computer system is partly to blame. It was put in when Maricopa was far smaller and only a handful of its residents voted by mail.\n\nHe said the system only allows his office to tally about 75,000 votes a day. There are another 375,000 votes outstanding in Maricopa County alone as of Thursday night.\n\nThe two Senate campaigns have long braced for a slow vote count. McSally is no stranger to the issue. It took The Associated Press 12 days to declare a winner in McSally's first race for Congress, which she narrowly lost in 2012.\n\nOn Thursday, she tweeted: \"Woke up this morning dreading a long and painful process.

She also reflects on early struggles in her marriage to Barack Obama as he began his political career and was often away. She writes that they met with a counselor \"a handful of times,\" and she came to realize that she was more \"in charge\" of her happiness than she had realized. \"This was my pivot point,\" Obama explains. \"My moment of self-arrest.\"\n\nObama writes that she assumed Mr. Trump was \"grandstanding\" when he announced his presidential run in 2015. She expresses disbelief over how so many women would choose a \"misogynist\" over Hillary Clinton, \"an exceptionally qualified female candidate.\" She remembers how her body \"buzzed with fury\" after seeing the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which Trump brags about sexually assaulting women.\n\nShe also accuses Mr. Trump of using body language to \"stalk\" Clinton during an election debate. She writes of Mr. Trump following Clinton around the stage, standing nearby and \"trying to diminish her presence.\"\n\nMr. Trump's message, according to Obama, in words which appear in the book in darkened print: \"I can hurt you and get away with it.\"\n\nThe Associated Press purchased an early copy of \"Becoming,\" one of the most anticipated political books in recent memory. Obama is admired worldwide and has offered few extensive comments on her White House years. And memoirs by former first ladies, including Clinton and Laura Bush, are usually best-sellers.\n\nObama launches her promotional tour Tuesday not at a bookstore, but at Chicago's United Center, where tens of thousands of people have purchased tickets \u2014 from just under $30 to thousands of dollars \u2014 to attend the event moderated by Oprah Winfrey. Other stops on a tour scaled to rock star dimensions are planned at large arenas from New York City's Barclays Center to the Los Angeles Forum, with guests including Reese Witherspoon and Sarah Jessica Parker. While some fans have criticized the price as too high, 10 percent of tickets at each event are being donated to local charities, schools and community groups.\n\nIn \"Becoming,\" Obama shares both pain and joy. She writes lovingly of her family and gives a detailed account of her courtship with her future husband, whom she met when both were at the Chicago law firm Sidley Austin LLP; she was initially his adviser. Secretaries claimed he was both brilliant and \"cute,\" although Michelle Obama was skeptical, writing that white people went \"bonkers\" any time you \"put a suit\" on a \"half-intelligent black man.\" She also thought his picture had a \"whiff of geekiness.\"\n\nBut she was more than impressed after meeting him, by his \"rich, even sexy baritone\" and by his \"strange, stirring combination\" of serenity and power. \"This strange mix-of-everything-man,\" when she finally let him kiss her, set off a \"toppling blast of lust, gratitude, fulfillment, wonder.\"\n\nBut throughout her husband's life in politics, she fought to balance public and private needs, and to maintain her self-esteem. She agonized over what she feared was a cartoonish, racist image. She remembered being labeled \"angry\" and, by the Fox network, \"Obama's Baby Mama.\" At times, she feared she was damaging her husband's 2008 presidential campaign, especially after conservatives seized on a line from one of her speeches \u2014 taken out of context, she notes \u2014 that for the first time as an adult she was \"really proud\" of her country.\n\nThe remarks faded from the news, but she sensed lasting damage, a \"pernicious seed,\" a \"perception\" that she was \"disgruntled and vaguely hostile.\"\n\nAs the first black first lady, she knew she would be labeled \"other\" and would have to earn the aura of \"grace\" given freely to her white predecessors. She found confidence in repeating to herself a favorite chant: \"Am I good enough? Yes I am.\"\n\n\"Becoming\" is part of a joint book deal with former President Barack Obama, whose memoir is expected next year, that is believed worth tens of millions of dollars. The Obamas have said they will donate a \"significant portion\" of their author proceeds to charity, including the Obama Foundation.\n\nWidely praised as a gifted orator and communicator, the former first lady has long said she has no interest in running for office, although she held a few campaign-style rallies before the midterms urging people to register to vote.

Those places traditionally have little or no security in place.\n\nLike Wednesday at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, Thursday night was college night at Billy Bob's in Fort Worth, Texas. It's a massive honky tonk near three Texas colleges and considered a local landmark. A night like that could bring in 1,000 students, and the folks in charge there are serious about ensuring their safety.\n\nChris Knowles is Billy Bob's manager. He said about 6,000 people show up on weekends for a big concert, which makes security a chief concern.\n\n\"Before a person enters the building, they're already looked at two to three times,\" Knowles told CBS News correspondent Omar Villafranca, referring to the surveillance cameras. \"And then they pass two check points where they're eyed by individuals as well.\"\n\nDespite a security presence that includes armed Fort Worth police officers, Billy Bob's goes one step further with its own employees by offering active shooter training to its management staff. Still, Knowles said \"you can never protect yourself 100 percent.\"\n\n\n\nRobert Smith trains security personnel at venues nationwide and said soft targets like Billy Bob's need to have a plan in place.\n\n\"There are active shooting incidents in bars around our country every weekend,\" Smith said. \"There is no change in the training for a nightclub, a bar, a sports venue, a church, a synagogue\u2026.and if the plan is to duck and hide, duck and hide.

One of those companies, Juul, holds more than 70 percent of the e-cigarette market share overall, and has become overwhelmingly popular with minors.\n\nExperts say these flavored products, like mango and fruit, particularly appeal to young people. Now, commissioner Scott Gottlieb plans to ban sales of most flavored e-cigarettes in two places: convenience stores and gas stations.\n\nThe restriction would reportedly not apply to mint flavors because menthol cigarettes are sold. He's also considering online restrictions, including having age-verification requirements for those sales.\n\nAdvocacy groups looking to protect teens said that they are pleased to see what they call \"first steps\" from the FDA, but also pointed out that this move will not affect mint flavor, at least for now, and they worry kids may just switch over to that.\n\nCBS News reached out to Juul about these new possible restrictions, but the company has not yet offered comment.

The administration announced on Thursday that it was moving forward with a regulation withholding asylum protection from immigrants who cross the border illegally first.\n\nThe interim final rule posted by the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security would bar immigrants who cross the \"southern border unlawfully\" from \"eligibility for asylum.\" Immigrants would have to apply for asylum status at designated points of entry, and those already in the country illegally would not be able to apply.\n\nThe announcement that the caravan would push northward on Friday, toward the official crossing at Tijuana, came shortly after caravan representatives met with officials from the local United Nations office and demanded buses to take them to the border.\n\nCaravan coordinator Milton Benitez told the migrants that they were still waiting for a response. But he later said to The Associated Press the officials had offered them buses for women and children but organizers demanded that they be for everyone. U.N. representatives could not be immediately reached to confirm this.\n\nThe migrants hoped that buses would arrive for them Friday morning but decided to leave Mexico City even if they didn't.\n\n\"God, please let the buses arrive, but if not we will walk,\" said 18-year-old single mother Delia Murillo who left her girl in Honduras because she feared for her safety on the trek.\n\nAddressing the assembly in the Mexico City sports complex, organizer Walter Cuello yelled: \"Five in the morning Tijuana!\" The migrants responded with enthusiastic applause and shouts. Their plan was to walk to the central Mexican city of Queretaro on Friday.\n\nSome migrants doubted the buses would arrive.\n\n\"There will be no buses,\" said Hector Wilfredo Rosales, a 46-year-old electrician from Olancho, Honduras, who was traveling with his 16-year-old son-in-law. \"They have lied to us a lot but we will walk like we have done so far.\"\n\nMexico City is more than 600 miles from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas, and a previous caravan in the spring opted for the longer route to Tijuana in the far northwest, across from San Diego. That caravan steadily dwindled to only about 200 people by the time it reached the border.\n\n\"California is the longest route but is the best border, while Texas is the closest but the worst\" border, said Jose Luis Fuentes of the National Lawyers Guild to gathered migrants.\n\nRosales said he would have preferred a shorter route \"because there are a lot of women with children with us and it is going to be very hard.\" But he agreed with the decision to leave Mexico City and hoped people along the way would give them lifts.\n\nThe migrants said they wanted buses to take them to the U.S. border because it is too hard and dangerous to continue walking and hitchhiking. Benitez noted that it would be colder in northern Mexico and it wasn't safe for the migrants to continue along highways, where drug cartels frequently operate.\n\n\"This is a humanitarian crisis and they are ignoring it,\" Benitez said as the group arrived at the U.N. office.\n\nThe Central American migrants began their arduous trek toward the United States more than three weeks ago and were turned by President Trump into a campaign issue in the U.S. midterm elections.\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum or work visas to the migrants, and its government said 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them while they wait for the 45-day application process for a more permanent status.\n\nBut most want to continue on toward the United States. Authorities say most have refused offers to stay in Mexico, and only a small number have agreed to return to their home countries. About 85 percent of the migrants are from Honduras, while others are from the Central American countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\nOn Wednesday, a bus left from Mexico City to return 37 people to their countries of origin.\n\nThere have already been reports of migrants on the caravan going missing, though that is often because they hitch rides on trucks that turn off on different routes, leaving them lost.\n\nThe U.N. human rights agency said its office in Mexico had filed a report with prosecutors in the central state of Puebla about two buses that migrants boarded in the last leg of the trip to Mexico City early this week, and whose whereabouts are not known.\n\nIn Mexico City, the migrants received medical attention and humanitarian assistance, including food, water, diapers and other basics. They searched through piles of clothes and grabbed boxes of milk for children.\n\nMarlon Ivan Mendez, a farm worker from Copan, Honduras, waited in line for donated shoes to replace the worn crocs he has used since leaving his country three weeks ago. He said he left because gangs were charging him rent to live in his own home.\n\nMendez said it wasn't fair that people talk of the migrants as criminals or bad people with gang members in their midst.\n\n\"It is not just that the good ones pay for the sinners,\" he said.", "Thousand Oaks, California \u2013 once considered one of the safest cities in America \u2013 is grieving the loss of 12 people gunned down at a bar filled with college students.

Police said Long used a .45-caliber Glock handgun with an illegal, extra-capacity magazine, first shooting a security guard outside the bar.

Police said the gunman appeared to fire at random.\n\n\"They ran out of back doors, they broke windows,\" Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said. \"Unfortunately, our young people, people at night clubs have learned that this may happen.\"\n\nIn a Facebook update attributed to Long by CNN, which said it was posted around the time of the shootings, he writes: \"I hope people call me insane (laughing emojis).. wouldn't that just be a big ball of irony? Yeah... I'm insane, but the only thing you people do after these shootings is 'hopes and prayers'.. or 'keep you in my thoughts'... every time... and wonder why these keep happening...\"\n\nLong had a run-in with law enforcement earlier this year.

No one has issued any reaction on her behalf, although her lawyers were expected to appeal the ruling, which anti-Marcos activists and human rights victims welcomed as long overdue.\n\nThe court disqualified Marcos from holding public office, but she can remain a member of the powerful House of Representatives while appealing the decision.

The Reuters news agency notes that she frequently accompanies him to official events.\n\nReuters reports that Duterte's spokesperson, Salvador Panelo, said the ruling against Imelda Marcos was proof that Duerte \"is not in the business of exerting undue interference or influence\" on courts, and he respects the decision.\n\nDuterte permitted the moving of Ferdinand Marcos' body to a special heroes' cemetery in 2016, Reuters adds.\n\nFerdinand Marcos had placed the Philippines under martial rule a year before his term was to expire.

Schneiderman, 63, said he recognizes that Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas' decision \"does not mean I have done nothing wrong.\"\n\nIn closing the six-month investigation, Singas implored lawmakers to pass legislation to criminalize slapping, shoving and other violence committed for sexual gratification.\n\nSingas, who was appointed to conduct the investigation by Gov. Andrew Cuomo in May, said investigators conducted an \"exhaustive review\" and that she personally interviewed each woman who had accused Schneiderman of assault. Investigators also spoke with members of Schneiderman's security detail and people who worked for him in the attorney general's office, she said.\n\n\"I believe the women who shared their experiences with our investigation team, however legal impediments, including statutes of limitations, preclude criminal prosecution,\" Singas said in a statement announcing her decision.\n\nShe said she found no misconduct by attorney general's office staff.\n\nSchneiderman said through a publicist he accepts \"full responsibility for my conduct in my relationships with my accusers, and for the impact it had on them.\"\n\n\"After spending time in a rehab facility, I am committed to a lifelong path of recovery and making amends to those I have harmed,\" Schneiderman said. \"I apologize for any and all pain that I have caused, and I apologize to the people of the State of New York for disappointing them after they put their trust in me.\"\n\nSchneiderman, a Democrat, announced his resignation in May, hours after The New Yorker published an expose saying that four women had accused him of slapping or choking them.\n\nSome of the women said Schneiderman was a heavy drinker.\n\nSchneiderman at the time didn't deny the allegations, but implied in an initial statement his conduct was either welcomed or was not as the women described.\n\nMichelle Manning Barish, a Democratic activist and writer, said Schneiderman became controlling and abusive - slapping her hard across the face and choking her - soon after they started dating in mid-2013.\n\nManning Barish said Thursday she felt \"completely vindicated\" by Schneiderman's acknowledgement he had abused women, and said she would work to ensure that legislation outlawing such behavior is passed into law.\n\nTanya Selvaratnam, an author and film producer who dated Schneiderman in 2016 and 2017 and described similar abuse, thanked Singas \"for the care she gave to the investigation.\"\n\n\"This experience underscores the need for legislation addressing intimate violence so all of those who experience it can come forward knowing they have protection under the law,\" Selvaratnam said in a statement.\n\nUnder current New York law, a slap, shove, or kick that doesn't cause physical injury can be charged as a non-criminal violation, but only if the offender's intent is to \"alarm, harass, or annoy\" the victim.\n\nCharges can't be brought if the offender's intent is sexual arousal or gratification, unless the victim proves the violence caused substantial pain or injuries that go beyond bumps, bruises and cuts.\n\nSingas' proposal calls for classifying sexually motivated violence as a misdemeanor, which would carry punishment of up to one year in jail, along with a two-year statute of limitations.\n\nManning Barish's lawyer, Debra Katz, said closing the gap in the law is \"crucial to protect victims of sexual abuse and violence from the deeply emotionally scarring injuries they experience in their intimate relationships.\"\n\n\"Without it, abusers can get off scot-free - even when they later admit to the behavior, as Mr. Schneiderman did today,\" Katz said.\n\nIn the meantime, Manning Barish is calling on Schneiderman to donate millions of dollars left in his campaign coffers to women's shelters and domestic abuse programs in the state, and that she wished him well in his recovery.\n\n\"This is a victory for all women but we need more than words,\" she said.\n\nSchneiderman's campaign fund had about $7.4 million as of July, according to a campaign finance report filed with the state. He had even more money stockpiled, but his campaign refunded about $1 million in donations in the two months after he quit.\n\nSchneiderman's publicist didn't immediately respond to a question about his plans for the money.\n\nCuomo appointed Singas as a special prosecutor, bypassing Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. because of a potential conflict of interest. At the time, the attorney general's office was investigating how Vance's office had handled a sexual misconduct allegation against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.\n\nThe allegations tarnished Schneiderman's reputation as a defender of women at the forefront of the #MeToo movement. Schneiderman launched an investigation last year into movie producer Harvey Weinstein's studio, and in February filed a lawsuit aimed at securing better compensation for his sexual misconduct accusers.\n\nLetitia James was elected to succeed Schneiderman Tuesday. She will take over the post from Interim Attorney General Barbara Underwood, who was appointed to serve out the remainder of Schneiderman's second term, through Dec. 31, CBS New York reports.\n\nAfter The New Yorker story was published, Manning Barish wrote on Twitter: \"After the most difficult month of my life-I spoke up. For my daughter and for all women. I could not remain silent and encourage other women to be brave for me. I could not.\"", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Actress Tamera Mowry-Housley and her husband, former Fox News correspondent Adam Housley, said that their niece, Alaina Housley, is one of the victims killed in the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, California.\n\n\"Our hearts are broken,\" the couple said in a statement. \"We just learned that our niece Alaina was one of the victims of last night's shooting at Borderline bar in Thousand Oaks.

Twitter has suspended the anti-fascist group that promoted the protest and tweeted Carlson's address.\n\nAbout 20 protesters gathered in front of Carlson's home Wednesday night, chanting loudly and using a bullhorn, according to a police report obtained by CBS News. Carlson said he was at his Fox News office, preparing for his 8 p.m. show, and his wife Susie was home alone at the time. The couple's four children were not there.\n\nCarlson's wife said she heard \"loud banging and pounding on her front door,\" the police report says. When officers arrived, they found politically-charged signs left on cars in the driveway, a sign on the front door and the anarchy symbol spray painted on the driveway.\n\nThe police report describes the protest as \"anti-political\" and a \"suspected hate crime.\" Police are investigating an offense of defacing public property, but the department told CBS News no arrests have been made.\n\nA group called Smash Racism D.C. posted messages on social media encouraging the protest and revealing Carlson's address. \"Fascists are vulnerable. Confront them at their homes!\" the group wrote in a Facebook post. In a tweet, Smash Racism D.C. said Carlson spreads \"fear into our homes\" every night and would be reminded \"that you are not safe either.\"\n\nIn videos posted on Facebook and Twitter, protesters are heard calling Carlson a \"racist scumbag\" and chanting, \"Tucker Carlson, we will fight!

It was a threat.\" He said someone \"started throwing himself against the front door and actually cracked the front door.\" He said his wife, thinking it was a home invasion, locked herself in a pantry and called 911.\n\n\"They weren't protesting anything specific that I had said. They weren't asking me to change anything,\" Carlson told the Post.\n\n\"They were threatening me and my family and telling me to leave my own neighborhood in the city that I grew up in.\"\n\nFox News issued a statement calling the protest \"reprehensible.\"\n\n\"The violent threats and intimidation tactics toward him and his family are completely unacceptable,\" the statement said. \"We as a nation have become far too intolerant of different points of view. Recent events across our country clearly highlight the need for a more civil, respectful, and inclusive national conversation. Those of us in the media and in politics bear a special obligation to all Americans, to find common ground.\"\n\nOther news organizations, including CNN and The Washington Post, published op-eds condemning the protest and saying it went too far. Former Fox News host Megyn Kelly called it \"stomach-turning,\" writing in a tweet, \"This has to stop. Who are we? What are we becoming?\"\n\nThis has to stop. Who are we?
