Sanders said Ricardel will \"continue to support the president as she departs the White House to transition to a new role within the administration.\"\n\nRicardel's departure comes after she clashed with first lady Melania Trump in a dispute that spilled into public view. The first lady told President Trump she was unhappy with Ricardel after the two fought over seating on the first lady's plane and National Security Council resources allotted during her visit to Africa in October, White House sources told CBS News. The two have never actually met.\n\n\"It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\" Stephanie Grisham, communications director for the first lady, said Tuesday. The statement was a rare public rebuke of a White House official by the first lady's office.\n\nRicardel was picked by national security adviser John Bolton earlier this year.\n\nBolton, in an email sent to NSC staff Thursday, said he is \"deeply grateful for all Mira has done on behalf of the NSC, her deep knowledge of the national security issues we confront daily, and her unwavering commitment to the president.\"\n\nRicardel, too, issued a statement, more than a day after her announced departure.\n\n\"It's been an honor to serve the president as deputy national security adviser. I'm proud of my tenure helping Ambassador Bolton build and lead a diverse team while working across the interagency to implement the president's national security agenda. I admire the president and first lady and have great respect for my colleagues who are dedicated to supporting the president's policies, and I look forward to working with them in the months ahead.\"\n\nThe White House said Mr. Trump is \"grateful for Ms. Ricardel's service to the American people and her steadfast pursuit of his national security priorities.\"\n\nRicardel's departure comes amid speculation that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Chief of Staff John Kelly may also be ousted from the administration.\n\nNielsen was Kelly's first choice for her post, and the chief of staff has urged the president to keep her at the White House.\n\n\u2014 CBS News' Kathryn Watson contributed to this report", "Using coupons and shopping for sales are a recipe for economic ruin. Those who employed these tactics to save money were far more likely to overspend during the holidays than those who didn't, according to a new report.\n\nA survey of more than 1,000 consumers found that less than one-third who didn't bother with coupons overspent, but more than 40 percent who did use coupons spent more than they planned on holiday shopping, according to Elevate's Center for the New Middle Class, which sponsored the study.\n\nThe results were nearly identical when it came to shopping for sales. Consumers who said they waited for sales promotions to control their holiday spending were 50 percent more likely to say they overspent than those who didn't.\n\n\"Realize that retailers have done this for a long time, and they may know something about how to open our wallets,\" said Jonathan Walker, executive director of the Center for the New Middle Class. \"There is something about the feeling that we've saved money that gives us license to spend more.\"\n\nTwo groups of spenders\n\n\n\nNotably, planned expenses are pretty high for the holidays even before consumers engage in budget-busting. The study broke consumers into two groups based on their credit scores -- \"prime\" consumers with credit scores over 700, and everyone else. It then asked how much individuals planned to spend during the holiday season. Those who put themselves on strict spending budgets and could thus predict their spending said they'd budgeted between $658 and $1,182.\n\nBut when all respondents were asked to break out how much they actually did spend last year on gifts, travel, parties, meals, charity and decorations, the numbers were far different. The \"prime\" consumers, who have credit scores above 700, said they actually spent a whopping $1,702, including $770 on gifts and $435 on holiday travel. The \"nonprime\" consumers spent considerably less, but still a healthy $988 on average. Roughly one-third of all consumers spent more than they had planned.\n\nPart of the problem may be that people forget the myriad of extraordinary costs that crop up during the season, from travel to additional charitable gifts, Walker said. This may be why the survey found that people who made gifts by hand and budgeted for each gift purchase weren't effective in stopping overspending. He suspects they forgot that only about 60 percent of holiday costs are for gifts. Decorations, travel and parties need to be accounted for, too.\n\nHowever, holiday overspending wasn't the only Yuletide budget-buster. More than half of survey respondents said some unusual expense -- a car or appliance repair, a medical problem or veterinary bill, an unexpected high utility bill -- hit them from out of the blue last holiday season.\n\n\"Car problems don't take two months off just because you're buying gifts,\" Walker said. \"You've got to have some money in reserve for the things that you wouldn't expect.\"\n\nHave a budget, and stick to it\n\n\n\nThe result of budget-busting was a big boost in average post-holiday debt for about one-third of the nonprime consumers and for roughly 20 percent of the prime group.\n\nThe one bright note: Individuals who put themselves on a strict overall budget were far less likely to overspend. Only about one-quarter of the nonprime and 30 percent of the prime consumers who had budgeted spent more than they planned. The budgeters were also more likely to say they ended up better off financially after the holidays than they were before, Walker said.\n\n\"We were trying to see what techniques people employed to avoid overspending and whether they worked,\" he said. \"Having a strict budget was the only effective method.\"", "Michael Avenatti, the attorney for Stormy Daniels and a prominent critic of President Trump, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, the Los Angeles Police Department said Wednesday.

Within three seconds, investigators believe the engine blew and shrapnel burst out a window in the passenger cabin, killing passenger Jennifer Riordan.\n\nNew testimony just released by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) says passengers rushed to help Riordan after they saw her with her seat belt still fastened, her head, torso and arm hanging out of the broken window. One even reached outside the plane to help pull her back in.\n\nRiordan's husband spoke to CBS News days after the accident, saying if he could talk to her, he'd tell her, \"I love you.\"\n\n\"I have no idea how I can do this without her, but because of her I know I can,\" he said.\n\nThe engine maker told the NTSB during a hearing Wednesday the failed engine blade had made about 32,000 flights, and was last been inspected for fatigue in 2012.\n\nAn examination of that blade after the deadly accident found signs it was likely beginning to suffer cracks from metal fatigue in 2012, but those cracks were smaller than what the tests at the time could detect.\n\nAnother Southwest Airlines 737 had an eerily similar engine failure in 2016 that prompted some additional engine inspections.

The \"backstop\" plan involves keeping the U.K. in a customs union with the EU until a permanent trade treaty is worked out.\n\nIt's a breakthrough, but the path to Brexit day -- just over four months away on March 29 -- remains rocky. May still faces pitfalls and threats from her domestic opponents as she tries to navigate the U.K.'s orderly exit from the EU.\n\nThe prime minister hailed the Cabinet decision as a \"decisive step\" toward finalizing the exit deal with the EU within days. It sets in motion an elaborate diplomatic choreography of statements and meetings.\n\nMany in the divided Conservative Party believe May's proposal leaves Europe with too much control over Britain's trade and borders, certainly if the U.K. remains for any considerable period part of the bloc's customs union. More philosophically, and perhaps more important from a public perspective, they argue that such a deal would betray the British public's will after the majority vote to leave the EU.\n\nMay insists her proposal delivers on key promises to reduce Europe's checks on British trade and immigration. \"We will deliver Brexit. We will not rerun the referendum,\" she vowed on the floor of the British Parliament on Wednesday.\n\n\"I firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of the United Kingdom,\" she said. And in a warning to her opponents, May added that the choice was between her deal, \"or leave with no deal; or no Brexit at all.\"\n\nThe draft divorce agreement between Britain and the European Union has two parts: a legally binding withdrawal agreement, which runs more than 580 pages, and a looser political declaration on future relations.\n\nHere are some key points in the deal May got her government to agree to:\n\nWithdrawal agreement\n\nTransition period: Britain will leave the EU on March 29 but remain inside the bloc's single market and be bound by its rules until the end of December 2020, while the two sides work out a new trade relationship. The transition period can be extended by joint agreement before July 1, 2020 if both parties decide more time is needed.\n\nIrish border: The deal commits the two sides to a \"backstop\" solution to guarantee the border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.'s Northern Ireland remains free of customs posts or other obstacles. It keeps the U.K. in a customs arrangement with the EU, and it will last until superseded by permanent new trade arrangements. Both sides said they hope to have a new deal in place by the end of 2020, so the backstop is never needed.\n\nDivorce bill: Britain agrees to cover contributions to staff pensions and commitments to EU programs the U.K. made while a member for the funding period that runs to 2020. The bill has previously been estimated at about 39 billion pounds ($50 billion).\n\nCitizens' rights: EU citizens living in Britain, and Britons elsewhere in the bloc, will continue to have the rights to live and work that they have now.\n\nPolitical declaration\n\nThe seven-page political declaration says Britain and the EU will seek a \"free trade area combining deep regulatory and customs cooperation,\" and \"ambitious, comprehensive and balanced\" arrangements for the services sector.\n\nOther ambitions include visa-free travel for short-term visits, smooth railroad, air and sea transport, and \"comprehensive, close, balanced and reciprocal law enforcement and judicial cooperation.\"\n\nDetails will be worked out after the U.K. leaves the EU on March 29.\n\nHere's a look at what's likely to happen next:\n\nBeeline to Brussels\n\nMay is due to update Parliament on Thursday on what has been agreed, while Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab will likely head to Brussels to meet with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier.\n\nBarnier declared there has been \"decisive progress\" toward a deal -- the phrase that allows EU leaders to call a special summit to approve the deal. They have penciled in a meeting for Nov. 25.\n\nPeril in Parliament\n\nOnce the EU has signed off on it, the deal also must be approved by the European and British parliaments\n\nMay hopes to get it passed by U.K. lawmakers before Christmas. Business groups warn that most U.K. companies will implement Brexit contingency plans -- cutting jobs, stockpiling goods, relocating production -- if there isn't clarity by then about the terms of Brexit.\n\nBut she faces an uphill battle. May's Conservative Party doesn't hold a majority of seats in the House of Commons and relies on 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to win votes. But the DUP said it will reject any deal that treats Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the U.K.\n\nSeveral dozen pro-Brexit Conservatives have vowed to oppose any arrangement that keeps Britain in a customs union and tied to EU trade rules, indefinitely.\n\nThe main opposition Labour Party also said it will oppose any deal that doesn't offer the same benefits Britain currently has as a member of the EU's single market and customs union.\n\nMay is calculating that, faced with the prospect of a chaotic \"no-deal\" exit -- complete with financial turmoil, gridlock at U.K. ports and shortages of essential goods -- most Conservatives and some opposition lawmakers will crumble and support the deal.\n\nPossibility of a party rebellion\n\nIf enough senior members of May's party balk at the deal, it could still lead to a challenge for the leadership of the party. In Britain's version of democracy, that means she could theoretically be unseated as Prime Minister and her entire government replaced through a snap election.\n\nA senior party member warned hardline Conservative \"Brexiteers\" on Wednesday, that if they fail to back May's proposal, it could backfire on them.\n\nFormer Conservative Party leader William Hague, who voted to \"Remain\" in the 2016 referendum, said the public's decision must now be respected, and warned that rejecting May's proposal in hopes of a better deal would be inherently risky: \"If you don't take this opportunity to leave the EU, to get Brexit over the line, you might never leave at all,\" he told BBC's Radio 4.\n\nUncharted territory\n\nIf Parliament rejects the deal, Britain enters unknown territory.\n\nLawmakers could try to send the government back to the negotiating table with the EU, though there's no simple mechanism to make that happen. They could defeat the government in a no-confidence vote in an attempt to trigger a national election.\n\nThey could even vote for a new referendum on EU membership, though it seems unlikely there would be time to hold one before the U.K.'s scheduled departure date. The U.K. will cease to be an EU member on March 29 -- deal or no deal.\n\nIain Begg, a professor at the London School of Economics' European Institute, said rejection of a deal would trigger a major political crisis because Britain's patchwork constitution offers no \"prescribed way out of that dilemma.\"\n\nHe said in that case, \"we really are into a period of great uncertainty about what happens next. I think nobody can know how it would unfold.\"", "OKAYAMA, Japan \u2014 Takuto Kawakami, 10, has a lot of questions.

The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court alleges Weinstein raped de la Huerta twice in New York in December 2010, taunting her with phone calls between the two assaults.\n\nNew York police said a year ago that they were investigating de la Huerta's allegations. No charges have been filed in the case, but Weinstein is charged there with sexually assaulting two other women.\n\nIn a new allegation, the suit states that the following month Weinstein exposed himself to the actress in a Beverly Hills hotel when she went to confront him. She alleges Weinstein tried to get de la Huerta to have a sexual encounter with him and another woman.\n\nCBS News\n\nAbout a year after the incidents, de la Huerta was fired from the HBO show \"Boardwalk Empire,\" and the lawsuit states she has reason to believe Weinstein was involved. It cites a photo that appeared in The New York Times of Weinstein talking to Martin Scorsese, a director and executive producer on the show, a few weeks before her firing.\n\nPolice officials and Mayor Bill de Blasio called de la Huerta's claims \"highly credible\" last year, reports The New York Times, but she was never added to the Manhattan criminal case. Her lawyer, Aaron G. Filler, told The Times one reason was because the Manhattan District Attorney's office couldn't corroborate the date for the alleged incident in Los Angeles. Filler told the paper the lawsuit seeks to use archival photos to corroborate de la Huerta's claims and show that she and Weinstein were both at the locations where she said the assault occurred. Filler said he forwarded additional evidence to the district attorney's office Sunday.\n\nThe office declined to comment to the paper on Tuesday.\n\nWeinstein's attorney Ben Brafman, in response to the suit, pointed out the lack of charges in New York. He said in an emailed statement that de la Huerta's \"newly minted version of events including her new California claims are equally preposterous and unfortunately, the product of an unstable personality with a vivid imagination.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Scorsese, who is not a defendant in the case, had no immediate comment.\n\nDe la Huerta, 34, alleges Weinstein damaged her career by at least $60 million.\n\nAshley Judd, who is among numerous women suing Weinstein, says in her own lawsuit that Weinstein hurt her career and prevented her from getting at least one role. Judd cites an interview last year with director Peter Jackson, who said that Weinstein warned him against hiring Judd and Mira Sorvino for his \"Lord of the Rings\" films. Both women have alleged that Weinstein sexually harassed them.\n\nDe la Huerta's lawsuit alleges Weinstein first pressured her for sex in her apartment after the two had been at a party celebrating the premiere of the film \"Blue Valentine\" in 2010, and threatened to harm her career if she didn't submit, then raped her when she refused.\n\nThe lawsuit states that Weinstein taunted her with phone calls for two weeks, and on Dec. 23 she agreed to see him at her apartment with the intention of demanding that he stop the calls. She drank large amounts of alcohol in her anxiety, making her vulnerable, and Weinstein raped her again, according to the suit.\n\nThree weeks later in January 2011, the two were both in Los Angeles for series of awards-season events when de la Huerta again tried to confront Weinstein. Her lawsuit states the mogul opened the door of his room at the Four Seasons Hotel and exposed himself to her and invited her to have a sexual encounter with him and another woman who was in the room and undressed, the suit states.\n\nCBS New York\n\nDe la Huerta left feeling \"embarrassed, scared, shocked and humiliated,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nShe then drank excessively and was denied entry to a GQ party at the Chateau Marmont. Photographers captured video of the drunken actress, further damaging her reputation and career, the lawsuit states.\n\nMore than 75 women have accused Weinstein, who was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, of wrongdoing. Weinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex, with his attorney challenging the credibility of his accusers.\n\nWeinstein faces criminal charges in New York over allegations that he raped an unidentified woman in his hotel room in 2013 and performed a forcible sex act on a different woman in 2006. A judge last month agreed to dismiss charges related to a third accuser, Lucia Evans, after evidence emerged that a police detective had coached a witness to stay silent about evidence that cast doubt on her account.\n\nBrafman said the detective had corruptly attempted to influence the case, affecting its integrity. But attorney Carrie Goldberg said Evans has no doubt that when Evans was an aspiring actress in 2004, Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him at his Manhattan office. Goldberg accused the district attorney's office of failing to investigate evidence and witnesses properly.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon insisted in court last month the rest of the case, involving two other accusers, was strong.\n\n\"In short, your honor, we are moving full steam ahead,\" she said.\n\nWeinstein had previously pleaded not guilty to the six sex crimes he was initially charged with.

Real estate agents say they're hearing from investors who'd like to become landlords and from sellers who've decided to pull their homes off the market, sit back and wait for prices to go up, up, up.\n\nThe surge of interest has followed Amazon's selection of those two areas to each receive 25,000 new jobs paying an average of $150,000.\n\nThe two localities already reflect the ultra-pricey New York and Washington metro areas, though real estate sales there had been relatively modest of late. Worries are arising, in fact, that housing prices in both places\u2014 whether for renters or buyers \u2014 are destined to price out all but the most affluent in the coming years.\n\nThe same trend, critics note, has long been evident in such high-tech centers as San Francisco, San Jose, California, and Seattle, where Amazon is based. In those cities, low- and moderate-income families increasingly struggle to afford housing anywhere near their workplaces.\n\nOut of concern that Amazon's arrival could make homes prohibitively expensive, buyers around Crystal City are suddenly rushing to close on sales, said Brian MacMahon, a real estate agent with Redfin in Northern Virginia.\n\nEnvisioning a stream of rising rental income, investors are calling from as far as California to inquire about buying homes they could rent out or just allow to appreciate in value, MacMahon said. Two sellers have just pulled listings from the market, he said, so the homes could be re-listed next year, presumably at higher prices, after the market adjusts to Amazon's arrival.\n\n\"When we have nice stuff coming onto the market, it's flying off the shelf,\" MacMahon said.\n\nBy choosing the New York and Washington areas, Amazon has inadvertently thrown a spotlight on the gulf between a small group of thriving but high-cost U.S. cities and the rest of the country. Housing in Amazon's two new hubs are well more than twice the median home price nationwide of $255,000, according to ATTOM Data Solutions.\n\nThe median price in Arlington County has surged 12.5 percent so far this year to $585,000. In Queens County, the median has risen 7 percent to $630,000.\n\nAmazon executives were drawn to the sizable pools of well-educated and skilled workers in the two areas, which they chose over 18 other finalists with housing that has generally been less expensive. \"Home affordability was not a prime deciding factor for Amazon,\" said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president of ATTOM.\n\nIn some ways, Amazon had injected adrenaline into a New York City market where price growth had exceeded wage gains to the point that residential sales had begun to slow. Until last weekend, real estate agents say, attendance at open houses for condos in Long Island City had been sparse.\n\nThe $1.7 million condo at the Foundry building, with its private terrace and skyscraper views, was once the kind of showcase property that triggered competing bids within a few weeks. Buyers, though, had adopted a wait-and-see stance as mortgage rates rose, luxury construction flooded the market and interest from foreign buyers waned.\n\nYet over the weekend, open house attendance in Long Island City suddenly tripled as word of Amazon's announcement became public, said Christopher Austad, a real estate broker with Douglas Elliman.\n\n\"We just caught a huge breath of fresh air \u2014 it's like someone just resuscitated us,\" Austad said. \"I've had a dozen new buyers and investors reach out this week. I've had past sellers contracting me and saying, 'Chris, we want to invest in LIC.' It's great.\"\n\nIn the Seattle area, Amazon's presence, along with that of other tech giants like Microsoft, is thought to have contributed to home values that have priced out even relatively affluent families and have left poorer residents with few options. Homelessness has worsened. Over the past five years, the median home value in Seattle has rocketed 73 percent to $739,600, according to an analysis by the real estate firm Zillow, which is also based there.\n\nPartly in response, the city approved a series of increases to its minimum wage that will reach as high as $16 an hour next year. It approved a corporate tax this year to help the homeless, though the tax was repealed after being challenged by the local business community, including Amazon.\n\nAaron Terrazas, a senior economist at Zillow, said he thinks metro New York and Washington will avoid the same predicament. \"I don't think we should expect a similar jump,\" Terrazas said. \"Both New York and D.C. have demonstrated a capacity to add supply in ways that Seattle was reluctant to.\"\n\nBoth metro areas are already comfortable with building blocks of apartment and condo towers, he said. Their high-density construction makes it easier to accommodate the job growth than cities that prioritize single-family housing.\n\nThey also contain extensive mass transit networks. In theory at least, the New York and Washington subway systems can ease housing price pressures by enabling workers to spread out.\n\nStill, the benefits of mass transit depend on New York and Washington maintaining and improving their systems \u2014 a severe challenge in recent years amid breakdowns, deteriorating tracks and rising expenses in both public transportation systems.\n\nYet the underlying message from Amazon's two selections is that big tech companies seem not to view housing costs as a barrier for hiring workers. Companies in Seattle and San Francisco have increasingly expressed concern that tech talent there would migrate to Salt Lake City, Boise or other cities where homes are more affordable.\n\nAmazon appears less concerned. \"There was anxiety in Silicon Valley that there are all these up-and-coming tech hubs that would challenge them,\" Terrazas said. \"What the selection of D.C. and New York underlines is how the dominant players continue to be dominant.\"", "New government research shows that tickborne diseases like Lyme disease continue to rise. The report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds that in 2017, state and local health departments reported a record number of cases of illnesses spread by ticks.\n\nCases of Lyme disease, Powassan virus; spotted fever rickettsiosis, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis and tularemia all increased last year. The CDC said there were 59,349 confirmed cases of tickborne diseases in 2017, up from 48,610 in 2016. In past years, health officials have acknowledged that the true number of cases is likely many times higher than the officially tally.\n\nThe findings reflect an accelerating trend of tick-related diseases reported in the U.S. Between 2004 and 2016, the number of such cases doubled. Researchers also discovered seven new tickborne pathogens that infect people.\n\nWhat's behind the increase?\n\nScientists say the reason for surge in tickborne diseases is unclear. However, a number of factors are likely at play.\n\nAfter another CDC report published earlier this year found that the number of illnesses caused by mosquito, tick, and flea bites have tripled in the United States over the last 13 years, experts noted that host populations play an important role.\n\nFor example, an increase in deer populations in residential areas can also bring an increase of deer ticks, which can lead to more people being infected with Lyme disease and other infections. This has been a growing problem in many communities as suburban development moves into formerly rural areas.\n\nScientists have also warned about the impact of climate change in spreading ticks and the diseases they carry to wider areas.\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nIn a 2017 report from the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, an organization representing 500,000 clinical practitioners aimed at taking action against climate change, Dr. Nitin Damle, president of the American College of Physicians and an internist in Wakefield, Rhode Island, said his practice has seen a significant rise in tickborne diseases, including Lyme disease and other infections, over the past five years.\n\n\"Those blacklegged ticks, the carriers of Lyme disease, thrive in warm, muggy weather. In my home state of Rhode Island, where winters have gotten warmer and shorter, these tiny, sesame seed-sized insects have more time to bite humans and spread Lyme disease. Tick season used to be relegated to summer; it now spans spring and autumn. And this isn't limited to the typical tick hotspot states,\" he said.\n\nHow to prevent tickborne diseases\n\nHealth officials warn that the United States is not fully prepared to control the rising threat of tick-related diseases. The CDC says better methods are needed to prevent tick bites and to control ticks and the diseases they spread.\n\nIn the meantime, health experts recommend the following steps to help protect yourself and your family from ticks:\n\nAvoid wooded and brushy areas with high grass and leaf litter; walk in the center of trails.\n\nUse repellents that contain 20 to 30 percent DEET on exposed skin and clothing for protection that lasts up to several hours.\n\nUse products that contain permethrin to treat clothing and gear, such as boots, pants, socks and tents.\n\nBathe or shower as soon as possible after coming indoors (preferably within two hours) to wash off and more easily find ticks that are crawling on you.\n\nConduct a full-body tick check using a hand-held or full-length mirror to view all parts of your body upon return from tick-infested areas.", "", "Devastating wildfires have seized California, scorching an entire town and forcing thousands of residents to flee from their homes.

His cast mates, Lance Barber, who plays George, and Montana Jordan, who plays Georgie, will join him on the episode. They will play their \"Young Sheldon\" characters in their cameos.\n\nThe episode will air in December, but no further details are available on the storyline. Considering the events of the two shows take place nearly 30 years apart, it's unclear how the worlds will merge.\n\nHopefully actor Jim Parsons, who plays an adult Sheldon Cooper on \"The Big Bang Theory,\" will get to pass on some wisdom to Armitage before he signs off the series, as \"The Big Bang Theory\" is set to end after its Season 12 finale.\n\nIn August, it was announced that \"The Big Bang Theory\" will come to a close after the end of this season, which kicked off in September. Cast members of the show, which has aired on CBS since 2007, shared their thoughts on the announcement.\n\nParsons said that he was especially grateful to the show's crew and writers. He said, \"I feel grateful to our crew - many, many of whom have been with us since day one - and who are the people who bring a sense of steadiness and dependability ... I am grateful to all the writers of our show - those with us now and those that have come and gone - because, without them, there would literally be no Big Bang Theory at all, ever.\" He concluded, \"I will miss all of you and all of this more than I can say and more than I can know at this time.\"\n\nA source told Entertainment Weekly that the show is coming to an end because Parsons, who plays Sheldon, wanted to leave.

Before the day was out, there was talk the utility's equipment had sparked another wildfire.\n\nSuch speculation was anything but idle. California state investigators in June faulted PG&E-owned power lines for sparking a dozen blazes in Northern California in the fall of 2017 that killed 46 and incinerated nearly 9,000 homes and other structures.\n\nPG&E's potential liability for the deaths and massive property loss in the Camp Fire is slamming the company financially. Shares of the utility plunged as much as 32 percent on Thursday and are down nearly 63 percent since Nov. 8.\n\nThat was the date PG&E notified the California Public Utilities Commission that a transmission line in Northern California's Butte County, just north of Sacramento, had failed at 6:15 a.m. Pacific time. The fire was reported at roughly 6:30 a.m.\n\nBillions in potential liabilities\n\nThe plunge in PG&E's stock price has lopped nearly $15 billion off its value as a public company and raised questions about its viability.\n\nPG&E said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it could face \"significant liability in excess of insurance coverage\" if its equipment is found to have caused the Camp Fire, while noting that the blaze remains under investigation.\n\nThe company has $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents after drawing down all of its revolving credit facility, and it has an additional $1.4 billion in wildfire insurance coverage, according to the filing. In statement to CBS MoneyWatch, PG&E said it tapped its credit facility \"to provide greater financial flexibility, including to pay down upcoming debt maturities and for general business purposes.\"\n\nInvestors estimate PG&E could be on the hook for $12 billion in liabilities, said Tim Hynes, head of North American research for Debtwire. That total exceeds the company's market capitalization of $9.7 billion.\n\nAnother Wall Street analyst pegged the estimated cost of the 2018 fire at $15 billion, noting it's still only partially contained. \"Liabilities are going to be significant,\" Citigroup analyst Praful Mehta said.\n\nAbout two dozen lawsuits have already been filed against PG&E for allegedly failing to maintain its power lines.\n\nLaw protects utilities from fire losses\n\nCalifornia lawmakers in August passed a wildfire measure that provided utilities some relief from wildfire-related liabilities. But the law, which covered damages only in 2017, was criticized as favoring companies over survivors. A new legislative session is set to begin in January, and incoming Governor Gavin Newsom has not yet weighed in on any plan to help the utility.\n\n\"The only real solution is to go back to Sacramento and get some form of recovery for 2018 damages,\" Mehta said of the newly enacted law, which doesn't address any potential financial toll from this year's infernos.\n\nThe pummeling of PG&E shares reflects that the market views the odds of a legislative fix to be low, he said.\n\nDebtwire's Hynes said the utility has enough cash to get through the next year, and he believes the state will step in to keep the company operating.\n\n\"It's the bondholders and the equity holders that will bear the costs,\" he said. \"If you're a utility customer, you're fine.\"", "The U.S. government strongly believes Austin Tice, a Marine-turned-reporter who vanished in Syria in the summer of 2012, is alive and being held captive in the war-torn Middle Eastern country, according to a senior State Department official.\n\n\"I want to make it very clear that the United States government believes Austin Tice is alive,\" U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Robert O'Brien told reporters on Tuesday. \"We are deeply concerned about his well-being after six years of captivity.\"\n\nIn an event hosted by the National Press Club, O'Brien said the State Department is spearheading an investigative and diplomatic multinational effort to locate the missing journalist and secure his release. The special envoy called on the Russian government \u2014 which has provided significant financial and military assistance to the regime of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad \u2014 to take part in this humanitarian cause.\n\n\"There are plenty of areas of disagreements between the United States and Russia at this time,\" O'Brien said. \"One of the things that both Russia and the United States should agree on is that innocent Americans, or innocent Russians for that matter, should not be held hostage and should not be held against their will.\"\n\nSince 2011, Syria has been embroiled in a bloody and convoluted war involving forces loyal to President Al-Assad, moderate rebel groups, Iranian-backed Hezbollah cells, ISIS and Russian and American military units.\n\nTice, a former Marine Corps captain who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, traveled to Syria in the spring of 2012 to document the nation's then-young civil war as a freelance reporter before starting his final year at Georgetown Law School. After filing award-winning reports for various outlets \u2014 including McClatchy, The Washington Post and CBS News \u2014 Tice disappeared in Aug. 14, 2012.\n\nFive weeks after his disappearance, a video surfaced showing an alive and blindfolded Tice surrounded by a group of unidentified armed militants.\n\nIn April of this year, when the FBI announced a $1 million reward for information \"leading directly to the safe location, recovery, and return\" of Tice, CBS News reported that although some believe he was captured by Syrian regime forces or pro-government militias, the circumstances surrounding Tice's disappearance remained a mystery.\n\nAlthough he said he could not disclose intelligence information that supported the government's assessment that Tice was alive, O'Brien, the State Department envoy, highlighted the fitness of the combat veteran as a beneficial characteristic during this type of ordeal.\n\n\"He's got the toughness of a Marine. And I'm sure that's sustaining him through these incredibly trying circumstances,\" he said.\n\nO'Brien noted that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been \"intimately\" and \"actively\" involved in the case and added that, along with U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and National Security Adviser John Bolton, America's chief diplomat has met with Tice's parents, Marc and Deborah Tice, on several occasions to brief the couple on any new developments.\n\nBefore the end of the year, Marc and Deborah Tice will undertake their seventh trip to the Middle East to apply for a visa to enter Syria. There, the couple hopes to be closer to Tice and reach out to whomever may be holding him captive.\n\n\"We continue our relentless effort to find the key that will open the door for Austin's freedom,\" Mr. Tice said.", "President Trump officially threw his support behind a criminal justice reform bill at the White House Wednesday afternoon, giving the legislation the push it might need to overcome a stall in the Senate.\n\n\"Working together with my administration over the last two years, these members have reached a bipartisan agreement. Did I hear the word bipartisan? Did I hear, did I hear that word? That's a nice word, bipartisan agreement, on prison reform legislation known as the First Step,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday. \"And that's what it is, it's a first step, but it's a very big first step. Today I'm thrilled to announce my support for this bipartisan bill that will make our communities safer and give former inmates a second chance at life after they have served their time, so important.\"\n\n\"It's the right thing to do. It's the right thing to do,\" Mr. Trump concluded, without taking questions from reporters in the room on the bill or pressing administration staffing matters.\n\nThe First Step Act, which has already passed the House, would constitute what would be a major overhaul of the criminal justice system. Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who was in the Roosevelt Room on Wednesday, has been working with senators and private sector stakeholders to make improvements to the country's prison and sentencing policies. Mr. Trump personally thanked Kushner, senators and law enforcement officials in the room.\n\nMr. Trump \u2014 despite his tough law-and-order rhetoric \u2014 has expressed some openness to making changes to the system. When Jeff Sessions was still his attorney general, Mr. Trump said he'd overrule Sessions \u2014 a known critic of sentencing reform \u2014 if the attorney general tried to thwart him on criminal justice reform efforts. Criminal justice reform may be one of the few things the Senate can pass in the lame duck session ahead of January, when Democrats gain control of the House.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House faces a slew of other controversies. Mr. Trump told the Daily Caller Wednesday he will announce a decision about the fate of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen \"shortly.\" His pick for acting attorney general, Matt Whitaker, faces scrutiny over his appointment and relationship to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. And first lady Melania Trump's office has called for the ouster of deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel in a public statement.", "", "Training for a marathon can be a long and strenuous process, and it can also be a lonely one. So, after years of training alone, longtime runner Jessie Rix decided to seek out some companionship.\n\n\"I came across this organization and it pairs runners with athletes that have disabilities of any and all sorts,\" Rix told CBS News of the day she first volunteered at Achilles International. \"It was a way for me to volunteer doing something I loved.\"\n\nWhat she didn't realize was that she would soon be introduced to something she'd love even more \u2013 a blind runner named Anthony Butler.\n\nCourtesy Jessie Rix\n\n\"I remember seeing him and he was just like the funnest person there and having the time of his life,\" she recalled. \"He had a ton of people around him talking, laughing.

Then, connected by a tether, the two began training for a marathon.\n\n\"When you're training for a marathon, you're spending probably 12 hours a week with someone,\" explains Butler. \"So you're there for a lot, like when someone loses their job or when someone gets out of a relationship, or someone's just having a hard day.

The automated spacecraft is packed with 7,385 pounds of equipment and supplies, including fresh fruit and ice cream.\n\nLaunch originally was planned for Thursday, but a 90 percent \"no-go\" forecast prompted a 24-hour delay. Liftoff now is targeted for 4:23:55 a.m. Friday, roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries MARS pad 0A into the plane of the space station's orbit. Forecasters expect a 45 percent chance of good weather, improving to 90 percent \"go\" on Saturday.\n\nHalf a world away at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, engineers are readying a Russian Progress cargo craft for a second launch to the International Space Station Friday afternoon.

From there, flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston will take over, pulling the supply ship in for berthing at the Earth-facing port of the central Unity module.\n\nRoscosmos\n\nTen hours later, the Progress is expected to arrive, guiding itself to an automated docking at the aft port of the Russian Zvezda service module around 2:30 p.m. It will be the first time two cargo ships have reached the station on the same day. Cosmonaut Sergey Prokopyev and Expedition 57 commander Alexander Gerst will be standing by in the Russian segment of the station to take over by remote control if any problems develop.\n\n\"Alexander Gerst is going to be helping out his Russian colleague for the Progress vehicle,\" said Joel Montalbano, deputy manager of the space station program at the Johnson Space Center. \"Normally, it's an automated docking, but they need to be prepared to go ahead and do a remote controlled docking (if necessary).

The booster, one of four making up the first stage, crashed into the rocket's central core stage, throwing the it out of control and triggering the abort.\n\nSince then, the Russians have launched three Soyuz boosters without incident for non-station flights. The Progress MS-10/71P launch Friday will be the fourth since the abort and if all goes well, the Russians will press ahead with plans to launch a fresh crew -- Soyuz MS-11/57S commander Oleg Kononenko, Canadian flight engineer David Saint-Jacques and NASA astronaut Anne McClain -- on Dec. 3.\n\nThey will join Gerst, Au\u00f1\u00f3n-Chancellor and Prokopyev aboard the station, boosting the lab's crew back to six for the first time since Oct. 4 when three other station fliers returned to Earth.\n\nThe day after the new crew's arrival, SpaceX is scheduled to launch a Dragon cargo ship that is expected to reach the space station on Dec. 6.\n\nGerst and his crewmates will return to Earth on Dec. 20, closing out a 196-day mission.

In addition, the court documents claim Herrell was declared the winner of New Mexico open 2nd congressional district by some New Mexico media outlets on election night.\n\nSome media outlets reported that Herrell was projected to win the race but rescinded that projection after Democrat Xochitl Torres Small began to close the gap and took the lead thanks to outstanding absentee ballots in Dona Ana County \u2014 a traditional Democratic stronghold.\n\nHerrell, 54, had declared victory on election night with early returns showing her in the lead and despite the high number of outstanding ballots in Dona Ana County.\n\nThe Associated Press called the race for Torres Small after the absentee ballots tallied Wednesday put her over the top.\n\nThe Dona Ana County Canvassing Board voted unanimously to certify the results Tuesday between Torres Small and Herrell following the last counting of provisional ballots.\n\nBut Herrell refused to concede and has alleged voting irregularities without providing evidence. On Saturday, Herrell told Fox News host Jeanine Pirro there were \"over 100 documented complaints\" about voting irregularities in the race.\n\nShe didn't provide evidence. Her campaign has not returned repeated voicemails, text messages and emails from The AP.\n\nHerrell also complained about the untallied absentee ballots from Dona Ana County and suggested fraud was involved.\n\n\"Everybody goes to bed on Tuesday night thinking that I've been declared the winner, and then suddenly on Wednesday morning they start hearing that there were 8,000 ballots that came up out of nowhere,\" Herrell said on Fox News.\n\nAlex Curtas, a spokesman for the New Mexico secretary of state's office, said the department had not received any complaints about any irregularities.\n\n\"Dona Ana County voters can have every confidence that their votes were counted properly and in accordance with the law and any suggestion that absentee ballots were somehow 'magically found' on election night is simply false,\" the secretary of state's office said in a statement in response to Herrell's Fox News appearance.\n\nRepublican Party of New Mexico chairman Ryan Cangiolosi said that the party would work with the Herrell campaign to evaluate \"concerning reports\" from voters.\n\nThe AP did not call the race for New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District late Tuesday because the secretary of state's website showed outstanding votes in Dona Ana County.\n\nThe Dona Ana County clerk early Wednesday said there were around 8,000 absentee ballots that had yet to be counted. Those ballots were eventually counted Wednesday evening.\n\n\"Xochitl was honored to receive a resounding majority of the votes cast, and she looks forward to working with all southern New Mexicans to help improve our health care system, fix our broken immigration system and grow our local economies,\" said Brian Sowyrda, Xochitl's campaign manager.\n\nHerrell is a member of the Cherokee Nation and would have been one of the first Native American women elected to the House. Herrell ran as a staunch backer of President Donald Trump, his support for a border wall and refused to take part in any television debates with Torres Small.\n\nHowever, Herrell also didn't campaign heavily in Hispanic neighborhoods and instead focused on pushing social issues to get her conservative base. She touted endorsements from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other conservatives.\n\nTorres Small, 33, ran as a moderate Democrat who promised to help the district's lucrative oil and gas industry and push for immigration reform while protecting the district's \"rural values.\" She highlighted endorsements from some Republicans.\n\nDemocrats have long targeted the heavily Hispanic congressional district that sits along the U.S.-Mexico border, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans.", "House Republicans voted on Wednesday to make current House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy the minority leader by a wide margin, 159 to 43, in their leadership elections for the 116th Congress. McCarthy was challenged by Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch conservative and prominent member of the Freedom Caucus. Rep. Steve Scalise won a unanimous vote to become minority whip.\n\nCurrent House Speaker Paul Ryan is retiring after this term, which left the minority leader post up for grabs. McCarthy was widely believed to be the favorite, but Jordan had some allies on the far right in the House. A few dozen members comprise the Freedom Caucus, which was instrumental in the ousting of former House Speaker John Boehner in 2015. McCarthy briefly ran to replace Boehner, but soon withdrew his candidacy, in part due to opposition from more conservative members of the Republican conference.\n\nMcCarthy has taken a harder line on issues such as immigration in recent weeks. He proposed a bill last month to provide full funding to build the border wall between the United States and Mexico, a campaign promise and passion project for President Trump.\n\nScalise was considering running for House speaker if Republicans kept their majority, but opted to stay in his current post as whip.\n\nMcCarthy and Scalise will remain in their current positions as majority leader and majority whip, respectively, until the new Congress is seated in January. Democrats hold their vote on leadership positions later this month.\n\nSeveral other positions were decided by unanimous voice vote: Rep. Liz Cheney was elected GOP conference chair, Rep.

The catch is that you have to work somewhere else.\n\nIn partnership with the George Kaiser Family Foundation, which is footing the bill, Oklahoma's second-largest city announced an incentive package targeting remote workers to relocate to Tulsa. The deal includes $2,500 toward relocation costs, a $500 monthly stipend and a $1,500 bonus at the completion of 12 months in the city, according to the program's website. To qualify, you must be a full-time remote worker or self-employed outside of the state.\n\nIn other words, if you get a job in Tulsa, you don't qualify for the cash.\n\n\"I suspect that they don't want to be subsidizing people who come here and would otherwise be competing for jobs with local people,\" said Gene Perry, a director of strategy and communications at Tulsa-based Oklahoma Policy Institute. Perry spoke with CBS News in a telephone interview Wednesday.\n\nIt's not the first time cities and even states have offered cash to entice would-be residents. Burlington, Vermont, rolled out a similar program in June and all Alaskans are eligible for payouts via the state's Permanent Reserve Fund.\n\nBut what makes Tulsa's program unique is its focus on remote workers. On top of the cash subsidies, the program, dubbed \"Tulsa Remote,\" comes with a free membership to 36 Degrees North, a co-working space in the city, which ordinarily charges members $149 per month or more.\n\nIt's a growing segment of the workforce. According to a 2018 Upwork report, 63 percent of companies surveyed had at least one employee working remotely, and hiring managers predicted that in the next 10 years, 38 percent of their full-time employees will work mostly remotely.\n\nBut Tulsa Remote's backers anticipate some of the participants won't be remote workers forever. The idea is that some may eventually start their own businesses and permanently relocate to Tulsa, according to Ken Levit, executive director of the George Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n\"So many people share with us that they're attracted to potentially moving here, especially from people in more expensive cities,\" wrote Levit in an email to CBS News on Wednesday. \"If you can come to town, and bring your job here, it can be a home run.\"\n\nThe George Kaiser Family Foundation is funding the program in its entirety and expects to spend somewhere between $250,00 to $500,000 in 2019 on 20 to 25 program recipients, but there's no hard limit to how many the program will welcome. Levit expects the first cohort will touch down in Tulsa in early 2019.\n\nMultiple calls to a Tulsa spokesperson were not immediately returned.\n\nOklahoma is one of the very few states whose cities rely entirely on sales tax for the government operating costs, said Perry.

The city's population was 401,800 in 2017, a 2.2 percent increase from 2000.\n\n\"This is about getting people to move to Tulsa,\" said Matt Fabian, a partner at Massachusetts-based Municipal Market Analytic, in a telephone interview with CBS News on Wednesday. \"They need warm bodies.\"\n\nTulsa's current economic base is anchored on manufacturing and aerospace.

One such neighborhood store is its Stamford Town Center location in Stamford, Connecticut, which The Wall Street Journal noted has reduced square footage by 8 percent.\n\nThat strategy could pay off, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, in a research note.\n\n\"One of the factors that necessitate a reduction in space is Macy's success in digital, where online sales continue to grow at a good clip,\" Saunders wrote. \"However, the flip side of this is that, in many locations, Macy's does not need to carry so many options and choice -- especially in categories like fashion.

Congressional aides and advocacy groups said lawmakers are close to an agreement on the legislation, which would boost rehabilitation efforts for federal prisoners and give judges more discretion when sentencing nonviolent offenders, particularly for drug offenses.\n\nHolly Harris, executive director of Justice Action Network, a lead advocacy group, said, \"We're hoping for a full-throated endorsement\" from the president.\n\n\"This will be the most significant departure from the failed mandatory minimum policies of the 1990s,\" Harris said.\n\nThe bill is a rare bipartisan endeavor in a typically log-jammed Congress and has attracted support from a coalition of liberal and conservative groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and groups backed by the political donors Charles and David Koch. Critics say current sentencing guidelines are unfair and have had a lopsided impact on minority communities.\n\nMark Holden, general counsel for Koch Industries and a longtime champion of prison reform, said an endorsement from the National Fraternal Order of Police has been critical in generating momentum for the bill.\n\n\"You have a lot of people who want to get this done,\" Holden said.\n\nHe said the legislation would save taxpayer dollars by reducing prison populations and giving federal inmates the opportunity to be better people when they leave prison than when they entered. \"We wouldn't be in favor of it if it didn't protect public safety,\" Holden said.\n\nThe Senate package overhauls some of the mandatory sentencing guidelines that have been in place since 1994 legislation approved by Congress and signed into law by then-President Bill Clinton. Talks involved a bipartisan group headed by Sen. Chuck Grassley, the GOP chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Dick Durbin, the chamber's second-ranking Democrat, and others.\n\nBut Trump's backing remains key to proceeding with any final product.\n\n\"Senator Durbin has been negotiating in good faith, but there won't be any agreement on a criminal justice reform compromise unless and until President Trump supports it and asks the Republicans who control both chambers of Congress to move it forward,\" said Emily Hampsten, a spokeswoman for the Illinois Democrat.\n\nGrassley said the bill would be easier to pass after the departure of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was ousted by Trump last week. Sessions was a longtime opponent of criminal justice reform.\n\n\"I think we have a commitment from the Justice Department now to work with us on it,\" Grassley said.\n\nKushner may play an outsized role in the final outcome after having steered the legislation this far. \"History will say this was a man with a mission,\" Harris said. \"He was really the critical voice that was able to hold the bipartisan alliance together.\"\n\nThe federal inmate population has been on the decline since 2013, when it peaked at just more than 219,000. The total now stands at about 181,400, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Still, that's about triple the number of inmates in federal detention 30 years ago.\n\nThe House approved a prison reform bill in May, but the Senate package makes additional changes and adds the sentencing component.\n\nThe Senate approach would allow thousands of federal prisoners sentenced for crack cocaine offenses before August 2010 the opportunity to petition for a reduced penalty. It would also lower mandatory minimum sentences for some drug offenses. The life sentence for some drug offenders with three convictions, or \"three strikes,\" would be reduced to 25 years.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he would test support for the measure during the lame-duck session.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he talked to the president about the legislation Monday night and that he \"seemed supportive.\"\n\n\"I've never been more optimistic than I am now, but we're not there yet,\" Graham said.\n\nAll but two Republicans voted for the House bill when it was overwhelmingly approved in May, 360-59. Democratic lawmakers supported the bill by about a 2-to-1 margin, but opponents voiced concerns that it did not go far enough in giving judges more discretion to make the punishment fit the crime.\n\nThe House bill directs the Bureau of Prisons to conduct assessments for every offender once he or she is sentenced and to offer rehabilitation plans designed to lower the chance of recidivism. The plans would include vocational training, education, counseling and substance abuse treatment.\n\nThe National Fraternal Order of Police said the extra help should be targeted to those with the lowest risk \"to re-offend.\" The group said that \"truly dangerous offenders,\" such as those who traffic in fentanyl or commit crimes while armed, would be ineligible under the compromise legislation it's worked on with the Trump administration.\n\nThe debate comes after Florida voters approved a measure restoring the voting rights of felons who have served their sentences. The Freedom Partners Action Fund, backed by the Koch brothers, and the ACLU chapter in Florida called the measure a way to provide a second chance for Floridians who have served their time and paid their debts.", "House Democrats are launching an investigation into Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker's involvement in World Patent Marketing, where he served as a paid adviser for the Florida company shut down by a federal judge earlier this year and fined almost $26 million for allegedly running an invention-promotion scam.\n\nThe Democrats poised to take over the committees on Oversight, Government Reform, Judiciary, Energy and Commerce and Intelligence announced on Wednesday that they are requesting information relating to Whitaker's role at World Patent Marketing.\n\n\"Because Mr. Whitaker was not confirmed by the Senate, both Republican and Democratic constitutional law experts warned that his appointment was, and continues to be, unconstitutional. In addition, because the Senate was not given an opportunity to properly vet Mr. Whitaker's background, serious questions are now arising about his fitness to serve in this position of trust,\" Reps. Elijah Cummings, Jerrold Nadler, Frank Pallone, Jr., and Adam Schiff said in a statement.\n\nClosed down by a federal judge in May, World Patent Marketing allegedly \"bilked thousands of consumers out of millions of dollars\" by promising inventors lucrative patent agreements, according to a complaint filed by the Federal Trade Commission in March 2017. The company did not admit or deny wrongdoing in the settlement.\n\nAccording to a statement from the lawmakers, they sent letters requesting briefings and documents to Mr. Whitaker; Scott Cooper, the former Founder and CEO of World Patent Marketing; the Federal Trade Commission; the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office; the U.S. Postal Inspection Service; and the Better Business Bureaus serving Metro New York and Southeast Florida and the Caribbean.\n\nIf these actors do not respond to the requests, House Democrats can subpoena them for information when they take the majority in January.\n\nDemocrats have protested Whitaker's appointment to acting attorney general, in part because he leapfrogged over Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was next in line. Whitaker, previously the chief of staff for the attorney general, has expressed skepticism over the special counsel's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, leading some Democrats to fear that he would not be neutral in overseeing the probe.\n\nThe Justice Department released a memo justifying Whitaker's appointment earlier on Wednesday.\n\nRebecca Kaplan and Katie Gibson contributed reporting", "ESCUINAPA, Mexico -- A caravan of thousands of Central American migrants is speeding its journey to the U.S. border, breaking up into smaller groups as buses and trucks carry some hundreds of miles in a day while others behind remain stranded.\n\nAuthorities have been struggling to deal with the first sizeable group of 357 migrants who arrived in the border city of Tijuana, Mexico, aboard nine buses.

The state police account contradicts witnesses who say Roberson, 26, was wearing clothing that identified him as a security guard; police say he was wearing \"plain black clothing with no markings.\"\n\nState police are investigating the shooting by the white officer from the Midlothian Police Department, who has not been identified. Protesters gathered Tuesday outside the Midlothian Police headquarters, some carrying portraits of Roberson, an aspiring police officer who played the organ at his and other area churches. A family attorney has said the young man was a father and that his girlfriend is pregnant with their second child.\n\nWednesday, community activists held a rally to call for Cook County State's Attorney Kimberly Foxx to investigate the shooting and for the officer involved to resign.\n\n\"This young man has a nine-month-old son -- he'll never see his child grow up,\" said local pastor Anthony Williams. \"This young man wanted to be a police [officer.] This young man was a child of God -- he worked in the church and lost his life, unfortunately, so we want justice.\"\n\nVia CBS Chicago\n\nPolice said a gunman had entered Manny's Blue Room Lounge in Robbins early Sunday morning, and shot and wounded multiple people inside the bar. When officers arrived at the scene, Roberson was holding down a suspect on the ground outside the bar, witnesses told CBS Chicago.\n\n\"A Midlothian Police Officer encountered a subject in plain black clothing with no markings readily identifying him as a Security Guard, armed with a gun in the west parking lot,\" state police said late Tuesday. \"According to witness statements, the Midlothian officer gave the armed subject multiple verbal commands to drop the gun and get on the ground before ultimately discharging his gun and striking the subject.\"\n\nIllinois State Police said the investigation later determined that the \"armed subject\" was a security guard and was \"attempting to subdue a subject believed to be involved in the initial shooting\" when he was killed.\n\nAn attorney for Roberson's mother says Roberson was wearing a hat emblazoned with the word \"security\" when he was shot. Gregory E. Kulis, who filed a lawsuit contending the shooting was unjustified and unprovoked, said the police release is woefully incomplete.\n\nFor starters, he said witnesses have told him that they yelled repeatedly both before and as the officer raised his weapon that Roberson was a security guard. Kulis suggested it's possible there was no mention of Roberson's knit cap because witnesses said it came off as emergency workers tried to administer CPR.\n\nAnother security guard at the tavern said the officer jumped onto the bar and waved an assault rifle before running outside and fatally shooting the guard, Kulis said.\n\nKulis said the surviving guard told him that the officer pointed a gun at him until he screamed at him that he was a security guard.\n\n\"That's when he jumped off the bar, waving the gun, and ran outside the door,\" said Kulis, who declined to identify the other security guard.\n\nAn official in a neighboring community has echoed the call for prosecutors to investigate, saying he's concerned race played a role in the shooting.\n\n\"Here is a security guard who is subduing a suspect,\" but the officer \"just sees a black man with a gun and kills him,\" Alderman Keith Price said.\n\nKulis would not say if he thinks race played a role in Chicago-area shooting, but the fact that the officer is white and Roberson was black has prompted some \u2014 including a prominent local African-American newspaper columnist \u2014 to question the officer's thinking.\n\n\"I believe a police officer showing up at a chaotic scene where a white man has a gun would have at least hollered for him to put the gun down before opening fire,\" Chicago Sun-Times columnist Mary Mitchell wrote after the shooting. \"But too often, black men are not given the benefit of the doubt.\"\n\nThe Illinois State Police wouldn't respond to a series of questions from CBS News, including regarding the contradictory accounts of Roberson's clothing, how much time elapsed between the time the officer shouted commands and opened fire, whether video exists of the shooting, whether the officer pointed his gun at another security guard, and how they respond to those who say race played a role.\n\nA spokesman said the investigation is ongoing and no further information outside of the statement would be released at this time.\n\nIn an initial statement, Midlothian Police Chief Daniel Delaney said only that the officer shot \"a subject with a gun.\" The officer has been placed on administrative leave, which is standard in such shootings until the investigation is complete, the chief said.\n\nDelaney later issued a statement Tuesday saying that there were conflicting reports immediately after the shooting about whether Roberson was a suspect or a security guard, reports the Chicago Tribune.\n\nDelaney said in the statement: \"Jemel Roberson was a brave man who was doing his best to end an active shooter situation at Manny's Blue Room.\"\n\n\"The Midlothian Police Department is completely saddened by this tragic incident and we give our heartfelt condolences to Jemel, his family and his friends. There are no words that can be expressed as to the sorrow his family is dealing with,\" the statement says.\n\nKulis said he is trying to gather information about the officer, who he said came to the Midlothian department four years ago from another department and is a member of a SWAT team.\n\n\"Where is the footage?\"\n\nPrice, the alderman, said he learned from witnesses that there are security cameras inside and outside the bar.\n\nFootage from surveillance or body cameras could explain whether Roberson was clearly identifiable as a security guard. Audio could determine what, if anything, was said to the officer before the shooting and whether, as witnesses have told the media, they shouted to the officer before he fired that Roberson was a security guard.\n\nSuch footage could also help investigators determine what kind of charges should be filed against the man who is suspected of firing a gun inside the bar. The man was one of four people who suffered non-life threatening gunshot wounds. Some community members have called for the release of any video, reports CBS Chicago.\n\n\"They say there's footage. Where is the footage? Let due process properly take its place in terms of what happened here,\" pastor Mitchell Lee Hicks told the station.\n\nIf any police bodycam video exists, no state law requires that it be released. The Chicago Police Department releases video within 90 days of a shooting, but that policy does not apply because that agency's officers were not involved.\n\nKulis also said he doesn't yet know how many times Roberson was shot or where on his body he was shot.\n\n\"I talked to the family after they viewed his body and they said they (authorities) did not tell them how many times he'd been shot,\" he said.\n\nIn his $1 million federal lawsuit, Kulis contends that the officer who shot Roberson violated the man's 4th Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\n\"The use of force is considered a seizure, and he needed probable cause to use force and he did not have that,\" he said.", "A Wisconsin manufacturing company gave its employees what may be one of the more unusual corporate Christmas gifts: firearms.\n\nBenShot, which makes glassware embedded with bullets, gave guns to its 16 full-time employees as a holiday gift because it wanted to provide a \"memorable\" present to its workers. Owner Ben Wolfgram told CBS MoneyWatch that the gift was also about \"personal safety,\" and that the company offered a handgun safety course to employees.\n\nEmployees could choose which type of gun they wanted, with a value of up to $500, Wolfgram said. Some employees chose smaller firearms, while others picked larger ones. Some had enough money left over to buy additional equipment, like holsters and ammunition, he added.\n\n\"They were excited. They went home and told wives and husbands, and not everyone believed them,\" he said. \"Guys want to buy guns and their wives won't let them.\"\n\nA couple of employees didn't want the guns, and were given gift cards instead, he said. The value of the gift is far beyond what most corporations provide to their workers at the holidays, with one study finding the typical company gift worth about $79 per employee.\n\nThe gift is in the vein of the company's culture and customer base, which tends to represent law enforcement, such as police and military officers. Wolfgram, who said he's a gun owner, started the family business three years ago as a way to spend more time with his retired father. The company's business has grown from just himself and his father to 16 employees currently.\n\nThe gift may raise eyebrows given the current debate about gun safety and violence. And Wolfgram said he received a few messages that \"aren't friendly.\" He added, \"But that's life, I guess.\"", "The U.S. Postal Service on Wednesday reported a financial loss for the 12th straight year, citing declines in mail volume and the costs of its pension and health care obligations, as the agency braces for an upcoming report ordered by President Donald Trump to address its \"unsustainable financial path.\"\n\nPostal officials said they expected next year's finances to be helped by a strong holiday season of package deliveries and a just-approved increase to the price of its first-class stamp, from 50 cents to 55 cents.

The company said it will roll out the home-bar device to more markets in 2019.\n\nThe product works in a similar fashion to Keurig's coffee machines, with consumers popping in a pod for the type of drink they want to consume. The machine will add carbonation for drinks that require fizz, and the machine takes about 30 to 60 seconds to brew or mix the drink, the company said. Adding ice is up to the consumer, however.\n\nThe device comes as Keurig is seeking avenues to expand beyond coffee. Its soda-brewing machine, the Keurig Kold, fizzled out after less than a year on the market, after consumers complained about its $370 price tag and disappointing flavors.\n\nWhile the Drinkworks home bar costs less than the Keurig Kold, consumers still need to buy individual pods, which adds to the price of at-home cocktails. A four-pack of cocktail pods costs $16 and a four-pack of beer pods is $10, according to CNET. Consumers will also need to buy carbon dioxide canisters, which cost $15 for a two-pack. Each one can make 15 drinks.\n\nMany of its ingredients are sourced from suppliers, such as barrel-strength whiskeys from distillers that haven't yet been diluted water, CNET noted. But whether it tastes as good as what a bartender can whip up will be the question on many drinkers' tongues.", "", "ST. LOUIS, Mo. \u2014 The body of a St. Louis ballet dancer was found in a rural northeast Missouri lake on Wednesday, a day after she was reported missing. A private pilot flying over Mark Twain lake discovered her body, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said.\n\nAbout 150 people were searching for Raffaella Maria Stroik, 23, when her body was found. Authorities said foul play is not suspected.\n\nAutopsy results are pending, CBS St. Louis affiliate KMOV-TV reports.\n\nAn investigation started Tuesday after Stroik's car was found parked for a second day straight near a boat ramp.\n\nStroik, dancer with the St. Louis Ballet Company, joined the ballet last year. Her profile on the ballet's website said she is from South Bend, Indiana.\n\nThe high school she attended in South Bend issued a statement Wednesday on her death.\n\n\"This is a sad time for the Saint Joe family,\" John Kennedy, the principal of Saint Joseph High School, said. \"We pray earnestly for the repose of Raffaella's soul, for the healing of the Stroik family, and for all those who knew and loved Raffaella.\"", "WAVERLY, Ohio -- Tony Rhoden, whose two brothers were among eight members of his family killed two years ago, said the family was still processing the recent news about the arrests of four people in the case.\n\n\"We just don't know what to think,\" Rhoden told the Columbus Dispatch. \"We're just trying to process it all. It's a lot to take in.\"\n\nProsecuting the Ohio family of four arrested in the killings could take years to conclude, a county prosecutor said Tuesday as the first break in the case was announced. The announcement marked the culmination of a massive investigative effort that began after seven adults and a teenage boy were found shot in the head at four separate homes in April 2016.\n\nPolice said that for the months leading up to the massacre, the suspects studied the layout of their victims' homes, their routines, and even their sleeping patterns, CBS News' David Begnaud reports.\n\n\"There is a lot of hard work ahead of us. I cannot emphasize that enough. An indictment is only the beginning of the case,\" said Pike County Prosecutor Rob Junk.\n\nOhio Attorney General Mike DeWine said a grand jury indicted the four members of the Wagner family on aggravated murder charges. Police arrested George \"Billy\" Wagner III, 47; his wife, 48-year-old Angela Wagner; and his sons George Wagner, 27, and Edward \"Jake\" Wagner, 26. They could be sentenced to death if convicted, DeWine said.\n\nThe victims were identified as 40-year-old Christopher Rhoden Sr.; his ex-wife, 37-year-old Dana Rhoden; their three children, 20-year-old Clarence \"Frankie\" Rhoden, 16-year-old Christopher Jr., and 19-year-old Hanna; Clarence Rhoden's fianc\u00e9e, 20-year-old Hannah Gilley; Christopher Rhoden Sr.'s brother, 44-year-old Kenneth Rhoden; and a cousin, 38-year-old Gary Rhoden.\n\nDeWine gave scant detail about why the victims were killed but said the custody of a young child played a role. Edward Wagner was the long-time former boyfriend of 19-year-old Hanna Rhoden, one of the eight victims, and shared custody of their daughter at the time of the massacre.\n\nEdward Wagner was also charged with unlawful sexual conduct with a minor for having sexual contact with Rhoden when she was 15 years old and he was 20 years old, DeWine's office said.\n\nThe Wagner family lived near the scenes of the killings about 60 miles south of Columbus. They moved to Kenai, Alaska, in June 2017, then returned to Ohio this past spring.\n\nKelly Cinereski, an Alaskan pastor and friend of the family, told the Dayton Daily News he was shocked by their arrests. \"These people wept over dogs, I can't imagine them taking people's lives,\" he said.\n\nThe mothers of Angela Wagner and George Wagner also were arrested in Ohio and charged with misleading investigators.\n\nBoth Edward Wagner and Angela Wagner previously told the Cincinnati Enquirer that they were not involved in the killings. Angela Wagner said in an email to the newspaper that what happened was devastating and Hanna Rhoden was like a daughter to her. Wagner also told The Enquirer that her husband, George, and Christopher Rhoden Sr. were more like brothers than friends.\n\nJohn Clark, a lawyer who has been representing the Wagners, has said previously that four of the Wagner family members provided laptops, phones and DNA samples to investigators, and agreed to be interviewed about the slayings.\n\n\"We look forward to the day when the true culprits will be discovered and brought to justice for this terrible tragedy,\" Clark said in a statement Tuesday.", "In a viral social media post, a group of white women challenged a Tennessee mall's unwritten policy against hoodies and accused the facility of racial profiling. The social experiment comes after a video from a local former journalist showed mall security stopping four young black men wearing hoodies, and placing one of them in handcuffs, at Wolfchase Galleria in Cordova earlier this month.\n\nAlong with three of her friends, Shannon Arthur set out Saturday to prove a point about the incident, according to her Facebook post. By walking around the mall with their hoodies on and off, the women wanted to show how they were treated differently than people of color.\n\n\"If a security guard spotted us with our hoods up, they very politely asked us to take them down,\" Arthur wrote. \"One guard said it was because they need to be able to identify everybody's faces. So we said, 'Sure,' took them down, walked on, and put the hoods back up a bit later. Repeat. No threats. Point made.\"\n\nShe concluded there's no doubt her group was given a \"pass\" compared to the men in the Nov. 4 encounter with mall security for wearing hoodies.\n\nWe four white women walked more than a mile through the Wolfchase Galleria wearing our hoodies and our privilege, just...

We must do better.\"\n\nThe post tallied thousands of reactions and shares on Facebook. Rapper Yo Gotti, who has more than 3.8 million followers on Instagram, praised the women on social media for putting a spotlight on the \"double standard.\"\n\n\"Last week a group of young black men were targeted by Wolfchase Galleria's racist 'No Hoodie' policy,\" he wrote in a caption. \"These women helped bring light to the double standard we face in our community and across America.\"\n\nCBS affiliate WREG spoke to ex-journalist Kevin McKenzie, who took the video of four men being tailed and confronted by security at the mall over their hoodies. Law enforcement agents \u2013\u2013 from both Memphis Police and the Shelby County Sheriff's Office \u2013\u2013 kicked the young men out of the mall, and one was taken into custody, according to WREG.\n\n\"I'm disturbed that even today and especially today probably because race is back on the front burner in America, young black men have a very hard time,\" McKenzie said. \"They're perceived as threats and they shouldn't be.\"\n\nIn a statement obtained by WREG, Wolfchase Galleria said the individual was removed from the mall after he did not remove his hoodie, despite multiple directives from a Memphis Police Department officer. Memphis police told WREG, \"MPD does not create policies for the Wolfchase Galleria. The owner of any private property has the right to ask patrons to leave their premises.\"\n\nCBS News reached out to Wolfchase Galleria for comment explaining the dress-code policy and the incident. Michael McGrath, a spokesperson for the mall, said in a statement Wednesday that it doesn't have a specific policy against hoodies.\n\n\"Wolfchase Galleria does not have a policy against hooded garments as has been reported. Our retailers sell hooded garments. We do, however, ask our shoppers to not conceal their identities while on mall property for security reasons. Our focus in on the safety of all shoppers. Security personnel are trained and required to enforce mall policies fairly and evenly.\"\n\nAccording to McGrath, the individual refused to comply with the policy and he was escorted out of the mall with instructions to not return for the rest of the day. When he returned a second time, he was escorted again. On the third time, he became \"belligerent\" when approached by Memphis police, who later detained his group he was with briefly. Police charged him with a misdemeanor before releasing him.\n\nMcGrath said the women in the Facebook post were not asked to leave the mall because they complied immediately and did not become \"belligerent.\"", "Reporting by CBS News' Fin Gomez, Arden Farhi and Kathryn Watson\n\nDeputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel is at the White House and working Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters, after First Lady Melania Trump's office issued an unusual statement Tuesday declaring Ricardel no longer belongs in the White House.\n\nBut her future remains uncertain.

Her memoir, \"Becoming,\" released Tuesday, already sits on top of best-seller lists. In it, the former first lady details her unlikely path from growing up in a small apartment in Chicago's South Side to living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In a wide-ranging conversation, \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King spoke to Obama in Chicago about the current state of American politics, overcoming self-doubt, and couples' therapy with Barack Obama. In their first national TV interview together, King also spoke with Obama with her mother, Marian Robinson, about life inside the White House.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 1: \"The presidency isn't ours to own\"\n\nGAYLE KING: It seems that whatever the Obama administration has done, it seems the current administration wants to undo. How do you handle that when you look at the work that you all have done?\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA: You know, the truth is, is that the-- the presidency isn't ours to own... It's the people's jobs. ... It's not how me and Barack feel... Because we occupied that seat for eight years and did the best that we could do. And the next president that is voted in gets to do the same thing. You know, the question that we have to ask, as citizens and as voters, what direction do we want our country to go in? And we-- we saw here that when you sit out, sometimes you get what you want, sometimes you don't. That's the nature of our democracy.\n\nKING: Why do you think Donald Trump won this election? You probably don't spend much time thinking about it.\n\nOBAMA: Because a lot of people came to the polls, and a lot of people didn't. ... Our democracy is clear. It's just sometimes people think, \"My vote doesn't count.\" And that's just so wrong. ... Voting matters. And the people who go to the polls determine how the country is going to be led. The notion that voting doesn't work, that it's fixed. No, it's not. You know? We saw in this midterm people wanted the country to move in a different direction. And they came out in record numbers. And they voted. And that's how it works.\n\nKING: Do you still believe, 'When they go low, we go high?' After all that has happened?\n\nOBAMA: Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, what's the alternative? You know, because going low means you're operating from your place of emotion. You know? It doesn't necessarily mean you're operating from a place of results... More often than not, you don't get results when you go low. You just, you know, get your attitude out. ... And... when you're in the White House, and you have that platform, and that responsibility where every word matters, you know, you're often thinking-- or at least Barack and I often thought, is what we're about to say gonna help? Is it gonna move the needle forward? Or is it just gonna make us feel vindicated in the moment? And you learn that vindication in the moment is so short term. ... Going high doesn't mean you don't feel-- have feelings, and that you don't express feelings... That you don't acknowledge hurt, or pain, or anger. You know, that's not what going high is. Going high means now you-- now you have the feeling. How do you express that feeling in the world? And how do you do that responsibly?\n\nKING: You end your book with, \"Let's let kindness in.\" You still feel optimistic about our country.\n\nOBAMA: Yes.\n\nKING: And we the people. We as a nation.\n\nOBAMA: Yeah. Because I-- I lived in the country, you know? I traveled the country. ... I saw the heart of who we are... Forget race, or party, or ethnicity, or gender. People agree with us or not. People were kind. ... People are worried. People have issues. But everybody's working for the same thing. The same goal. And I got to see that part of America.\n\nPart 2: \"Series of punches\" and almost leaving the campaign\n\nAs first lady, Obama found herself on the world stage as one of the most visible women in the world. But growing up she says she was haunted by self-doubt \u2013 one of the revelations in her memoir. In her conversation with King, Obama describes learning that she was not alone in wondering, \"Am I good enough?\"\n\nKING: You've been out of the White House for 663 days.\n\nOBAMA: Oh my gosh. (LAUGHTER)\n\nKING: How's it going?\n\nOBAMA: It's going okay.\n\nKING: I want people to get a sense, Michelle, of your life.\n\nOBAMA: Uh-huh. Yeah. My life now?\n\nKING: Your life now.\n\nOBAMA: Uh-huh.\n\nKING: And that first day. It's one of those rare moments. I call it Toast-gate for lack of a better thing. Toast-gate.\n\nOBAMA: Yeah. (LAUGH) This is how I open up the book, as sort of the life that I was living months after we had moved out of the White House. ... I was alone for the first time in a long time. ... Because for eight years prior to that, I had lived a life where I was always with somebody. There was always a constant presence in the White House. ... But that day... Barack was traveling, Malia was in college, Sasha was somewhere doing something. And it was just me, and Bo, and Sunny, my dogs. ... And I did what I didn't do for eight years, which was open up my own cupboard, pull out some bread, and make some cheese toast.\n\nKING: Did you remember how to do that?\n\nOBAMA: I remembered! ... I still had cheese toast skills.\n\nKING: Throughout the book there is a lot of, \"Am I good enough?\" ... You're told by a school counselor, \"You're not Princeton material\"... Why did that not destroy you at the time?\n\nOBAMA: Well, because fortunately... it was the direct opposite of everything I had ever been told about myself. ... I had grown up with love and support and encouragement and high expectations. ... But here I walked into this room with a woman who really didn't know me, because it was a big high school, and she had to make a quick assessment. And her assessment could've been-- and I don't know-- was, \"Grade point average? Yeah, you're a good student. You know, your scores are good. You're black. You're here in this public school. Maybe you're stretching.\" She didn't even know my brother went to Princeton. She didn't ask me any questions. ... She didn't try to figure me out. She just decided that the dream I presented was wrong. ... But let me tell you... we could probably go into any room of black women, or people of color, or people who grew up in poor communities, or rural communities, and you'd ask them, \"Has anybody ever told you you couldn't?\" And everyone would raise their hand.\n\nKING: You get to Princeton, and one of the first things you notice is... \"They're not smarter than me.\"\n\nOBAMA: Mmm-hmm. So now I'm expecting brilliance. Genius. And then what I discover is, wow, there's a lot of arbitrariness to this stuff, you know? Because while a lot of students are sort of criticized, there's a debate about affirmative action when it comes to race. What I point out is that I got to Princeton, I realized there's a whole-- all kinds of affirmative action that goes on. There are kids who get in because they're athletes. There are kids who get in because there's a legacy. ... It's just that race stands out. ... But it was important for me to see that.\n\n[OBAMA during the 2008 campaign: \"Are you tired of the way the country is going? Are you mad enough?\"]\n\nKING: Did you feel you were judged differently? Because you write in the book your grace would have to be earned.\n\nOBAMA: Mmm-hmm.\n\nKING: You knew that you-- you felt you could not stumble.\n\nOBAMA: Yeah. Well I-- I had experienced that over the course of the campaign. ... I write in Chapter 17, you know, that chapter was probably one of the hardest for me to write. And it's the hardest, still, for me to read. Because it goes over a painful time in the campaign when I thought I was doing great telling my story, sharing it honestly. But... my whole persona was distorted. This was the time I was called an 'angry black woman.' I was called 'Obama's babies' mama.' I was called someone who didn't love her country. And I-- I-- I-- I-- it's important for me to paint all that. Because people don't remember that. They see Michelle Obama. Now, especially young girls. And they don't-- they don't-- they were too young to know that part of my journey.\n\nKING: Let's go back to 'angry black woman.' How did you process that? ... It's painful.\n\nOBAMA: It's like the punch in the gut that the counselor... it was another series of punches. Someone who judged me without knowing me. It was just happening at a bigger level. ... But I had to draw on the same foundation of, I cannot let one, or two, or a few people's judgements of me control me. And at that point I had thought about getting off the campaign trail. And I--\n\nKING: You went to Barack Obama and said--\n\nOBAMA: Yeah. I was like, \"Look, if I'm not an asset, then just pull me out.\" And he was like, \"No. You are--you're the closer. You know, we need you out there.\" And so I had to get myself together... I'm gonna have to show the world that I do belong. I am good enough to be the first lady. I do love my country.\n\nPart 3: Martial counseling, and her mother, Marian Robinson\n\nMichelle Obama says it was never easy being the wife of a driven politician. The demands of campaigning and politics strained their marriage, she said, and they sought help in couples' therapy. In their first national TV interview together, King also spoke with Marian Robinson, Obama's mother, about her eight years in the White House.\n\nKING: You've had a complicated relationship, it seems, with politics.\n\nOBAMA: Mmm-hmm. Every time Barack came to me with the idea of running for an office, I was just like, \"Please don't do this. Pick another career. You're gifted. Y'all went to college. You got a law degree. Can't you do anything else besides this?\" There's so many ways to save the world. But every time I had to think to myself, that approach is selfish. Because I knew I was married to someone who was gifted and someone who could contribute. And but for the fact that I was married to him... it would be hard on me-- I would want him to run.\n\nKING: Yeah. But he was always a different kind of guy.\n\nOBAMA: He's a different guy--\n\nKING: He's a different kind of dude. There's a great story in the book where you said, you wake up one night, and he's staring into space. Is he thinking about his dad? Or is something bothering him?\n\nOBAMA: (LAUGH) Right.\n\nKING: And what was he thinking about?\n\nOBAMA: Like, income inequality. It's like, really, dude? I thought you were dreaming about me.\n\nKING: So you knew he was different. ... You're very candid about talking about marital counseling.\n\nOBAMA: Mmm-hmm. You know, I-- I tell young couples it's like when you get married, you've got that moment. Those-- those years, if you're lucky, where it's just the two of you. Individuals on your paths. You come together when you need to. It all works until you have kids. Your first joint project where the inequalities are felt, you know... I'm working, and managing child care, and sick kids, and trying to coordinate my job, and he's flittering in... Tension started to-- to arise. And we knew that we needed to have a place where we could really work these feelings out.\n\nKING: Was he like, \"Great, let's go to counseling\"?\n\nOBAMA: Oh, no. Oh, no. No, he was--\n\nKING: \"I can't wait to go.\"\n\nOBAMA: He was-- Barack is a problem solver. It's like, \"I'll buy a book, and we will study--\"\n\nKING: (LAUGH) On relationships.\n\nOBAMA: On relationships. And we still study Chapter 12. You read Chapter 13. And we can figure this out. You know? It's just one of those things. It's like we don't need help from anybody. And I was like-- Because for me I was like, I need to go to somebody who's going to tell you you're wrong-- exactly, and I talk about that. It's like, well, I didn't get that. The period of counseling, for me, was a turning point. Because I learned that... I was still responsible for my own happiness. ... It wasn't his job to solely make me happy. I had to figure out my space in this.\n\nKING: Do you still feel if we need to go back, we would do that? Even--\n\nOBAMA: Absolutely.\n\nKING: --even though that you're so well known now?\n\nOBAMA: Oh, gosh, yes! Yeah. I-- I-- I think counseling is one of those tune up times. ... Marriage is hard. All marriages are hard. And even-- look, I-- you-- you know us. I love my husband.\n\nKING: Yeah.\n\nOBAMA: We have a wonderful marriage. But it takes work.\n\nLazarus Jean-Baptiste/CBS News\n\nKING (to ROBINSON): The whole eight years you were in the White House, I think I could count how many times I saw you on TV. And I got up to one, and then I had to stop.\n\nMARIAN SHIELDS ROBINSON: Stop. (LAUGH)\n\nKING: Yeah. It's just not something that you do. ... But why is it that you didn't want to do interviews, Mrs. Robinson?\n\nROBINSON: I didn't want to say anything that would-- you know how you accidentally say things? I figured if I didn't say anything, then I wouldn't say the wrong thing. (LAUGH)\n\nKING: We don't have to worry about that. ... When your daughter becomes first lady of the United States, and your son-in-law is the president, how do you wrap your brain around that? What are you thinking?\n\nROBINSON: It's pretty difficult. Let's face it.\n\nKING: Uh-huh. Why?\n\nROBINSON: Because I felt like this was going to be a very hard life for both of them. And I want-- was worried about their safety. And I was worried about my grandkids. I mean, that's what got me to move to D.C.\n\nKING: Why did you want her there? Why was it important to you?\n\nOBAMA: Oh, because-- for the girls. You know, I-- I-- I wanted them to come home to family... There was just parts of the girls' lives that I just knew were gonna be okay 'cause mom was there. When I traveled internationally, grandma was there. When I wasn't home at the end of the day, grandma was there. When the kids were still little and they needed to have someone be with them in school. I mean, you think about my girls were being driven around in a motorcade of three cars with at least four grown adults with guns in each of those cars. And I just thought that that's an unnatural way for a little second grader to go to school. Well, mom would ride in the car with her to make it feel like a regular carpool.\n\nKING: You're in the White House where they say, \"Mrs. Robinson, can we get you something? Mrs. Robinson, do you need anything?\"\n\nROBINSON: Right.\n\nKING: Was that a big adjustment for you?\n\nROBINSON: It was a huge adjustment. As a matter of fact, I had talked them into allowing me to do my own laundry.\n\nKING: You were doing your own laundry?\n\nROBINSON: Yes. (LAUGH)\n\nOBAMA: And she taught the girls how to do their laundry. They would go upstairs for laundry lessons. And she was the most beloved figure in the White House. Let me tell you.\n\nKING: I believe that.\n\nOBAMA: And she had a stream of people. The butlers, the housekeepers. They would all stop by, and they would-- grandma's room was like the confessional. You know, everyone would go there and just unload, you know? And then they'd leave. People still visit mom in Chicago.\n\nROBINSON: They were like family.\n\nOBAMA: Some of the staff come and visit.

(LAUGH)", "bad url", "LONDON -- Prime Minister Theresa May has managed to hash out a draft agreement with the European Union on the terms of Britain's looming divorce from the EU, and to convince her own divided cabinet that the deal is a better than the default alternative -- a \"no-deal Brexit.\" May emerged from her official residence at No. 10 Downing Street in London on Wednesday evening after a five-hour, \"detailed and impassioned debate\" to say her cabinet had taken a \"decisive step\" in the Brexit process.\n\nHer government still needs the British Parliament, and all other EU member states, to sign off on the deal. May's government or the EU were expected to make the full details of the draft Brexit proposal public this week.\n\nMay's negotiating team handed its 500-page proposal over to cabinet members earlier on Wednesday, after they finally nailed down an agreement with EU counterparts on what has proved the most contentious issue; keeping the border between Northern Ireland (which is Britain) and Ireland (which is Europe) open and unrestricted.\n\nThe proposal from May's team would, according to details leaked to British media, temporarily keep the entire U.K. within the European customs union, in exchange for the EU allowing the Irish border to remain free of physical barriers or checkpoints. That key tradeoff means Britain would still, for an unclear period, be subject to the EU's collective trade rules.\n\nThe trade union mandates tariff-free movement of goods across national boundaries within the bloc, and sets standardized rates for imports from outside the EU. It also sets dozens of other rules for trade within the EU.\n\nMay must convince her own\n\nIt has taken more than two years of agonizing negotiations in Brussels, set in motion by the 2016 public referendum result demanding the U.K. leave the European bloc, to get to this point. With her cabinet's backing secured, May must now win over even more skeptics in her own party.\n\nMany in the divided Conservative Party believe her proposal leaves Europe with too much control over Britain's trade and borders, certainly if the U.K. remains for any considerable period part of the bloc's customs union. More philosophically, and perhaps more importantly from a public perpective, they argue that such a deal would betray the British public's will after the majority vote to leave the EU.\n\nShe insists her proposal delivers on key promises to reduce Europe's checks on British trade and immigration.\n\n\"We will deliver Brexit. We will not rerun the referendum,\" she vowed on the floor of the British Parliament on Wednesday.\n\nShe has framed the choice that faced her senior aides, and which now faces the British Parliament, in stark terms: accept her deal with the EU, which she says is the best one Britain could possibly attain, or reject it and leave Britain susceptible to as-yet-unclear consequences when the divorce happens anyway on March 29, as stipulated by EU rules.\n\nExperts, politicians and pundits have warned for months that such a \"no-deal\" Brexit could cripple trade and the flow of essential goods into Britain, given that the kingdom would suddenly have no trade agreements in place with its most vital trading partner; the other 27 members of the European Union.\n\nWhat May does not often discuss in public is the third option: a rejection of her Brexit proposal, and her leadership entirely.\n\nPossibility of a party rebellion\n\nIf enough senior members of May's party balk at the deal, it could still lead to a challenge for the leadership of the party. In Britain's version of democracy, that means she could theoretically be unseated as Prime Minister and her entire government replaced through a snap election.\n\n(Put simply, in the U.K. the public elects a party to lead the government, rather than a single person to lead the executive branch, as in the U.S. Party leaders are elected internally, and the leader of the party which wins a majority of seats in Parliament [when there is a clear majority] serves as prime minister.)\n\nA senior party member warned hardline Conservative \"Brexiteers\" on Wednesday, that if they fail to back May's proposal, it could backfire on them.\n\nFormer Conservative Party leader William Hague, who voted to \"Remain\" in the 2016 referendum, said the public's decision must now be respected, and warned that rejecting May's proposal in hopes of a better deal would be inherently risky: \"If you don't take this opportunity to leave the EU, to get Brexit over the line, you might never leave at all,\" he told BBC's Radio 4.\n\nA second referendum?\n\nThat last remark from Hague was an acknowledgement of a growing movement in the U.K. -- in the public and among lawmakers from all major parties, including some Conservatives -- for a second public referendum on any Brexit deal eventually agreed on by Parliament.\n\nBoth left-leaning British lawmakers who never wanted to leave the EU, and some ardent backers of the vote to \"Leave\" have pushed for a second referendum, albeit with starkly different motivations.\n\nWhile the Brexiteers are hoping another vote would bolster the mandate for a \"hard\" Brexit (a clean break, with the U.K. leaving all EU customs and trade agreements), many \"Remainers\" believe a second referendum could see the British public completely reverse its 2016 decision and reject any Brexit at all. The EU has left open the possibility of a British reversal.\n\nRemainers point to polls which show a shift in opinion over the last two years, during which time the Brexit movement has been accused of lying about the potential benefits and pitfalls of a divorce from the EU -- and breaking Britain's election laws -- during the bitter campaign ahead of the first referendum.\n\nHague suggested on Wednesday that if May's cabinet had failed to back her proposal, \"it would probably mean a different government.\"\n\nWith the cabinet's backing secured, any potential challenges appeared to be staved off on Wednesday, at least for the time being,\n\nBut senior members of May's cabinet have already left over her handling of the entire Brexit negotiations, including lead Brexit campaigner and former London Mayor Boris Johnson. If anyone from within the Conservative Party was to stage a challenge to May for leadership, his name is high in the betting odds.\n\nThe terms of the divorce still need to be agreed not only by Britain's Parliament (and possibly the public if a second referendum is called), but also by the governments of all 27 other EU member states.\n\nIf a deal is not finalized and put in place by March 29, the British withdrawal from the EU will be triggered automatically (no-deal Brexit) and all standing trade agreements between Britain and the EU will end. Britain's trade with all non-EU nations is also currently controlled to a large degree by EU regulations -- it also currently benefits from the collective bargaining power of membership in the 28-member bloc.\n\nBroad World Trade Organization rules would apply under that scenario, but without specific deals in place, economists say the cost of trade for the U.K. would increase significantly, at least until new agreements are reached.", "", "The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel on Wednesday released the legal advice it gave the White House as to whether a senior Justice Department official like Matt Whitaker could be appointed acting attorney general, CBS News' Paula Reid reports.\n\nIn short, the Justice Department's lawyers, in the memo dated Wednesday, argued an appointment Whitaker's is lawful.\n\nA senior Justice Department official who worked on the memo and spoke to reporters on a conference call Wednesday morning confirmed the Justice Department gave the White House verbal advice, then codified that advice in a memo.\n\nMaryland's attorney general has already filed a lawsuit arguing Whitaker's appointment is illegal and unconstitutional. Critics of the Trump administration say that Sessions cannot be replaced, even temporarily, by someone who is not Senate-confirmed.\n\nA senior official on the conference called Wednesday refused to answer questions about when the White House sought advice from the Justice Department.\n\nRead the Justice Department memo here:\n\nThe Justice Department says the last time a senior official was appointed acting attorney general without Senate confirmation was 1886 \u2014 before the Justice Department even existed. Assistant Attorney General Steven Engel, who wrote the memo for the Justice Department, argued that an acting attorney general is not a principal officer because he is only in the job temporarily. Whitaker can serve in a temporary position for 210 days.\n\n\u2014 CBS News' Kathryn Watson contributed to this report", "SIMPSONVILLE, S.C. -- The winner of a massive $1.537 billion Mega Millions jackpot has yet to come claim the prize weeks after the drawing, CBS Columbia affiliate WLTX reports.\n\nOne winning ticket for the jackpot was sold in Simpsonville, South Carolina, in the northwest part of the state. The drawing took place on October 23, and state lottery officials told WLTX there is no word yet on the winner.\n\nSouth Carolina lottery officials previously said the winner has 180 days to claim the prize and that they can stay anonymous. The retailer that sold the ticket gets a $50,000 cut once the prize is claimed.\n\nThe winning ticket had to match all five white balls in the October 23 drawing as well as the yellow Mega Ball to claim the jackpot. The winning numbers were 5, 28, 62, 65, 70 and Mega Ball 5.\n\nThe jackpot had been soaring since July, when a group of office workers in California won $543 million.", "", "DES MOINES, Iowa\u2014 While in private business, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker walked away from a taxpayer-subsidized apartment-rehabilitation project in Iowa after years of cost overruns, delays and other problems, public records show.\n\nThe city of Des Moines ultimately yanked an affordable housing loan that Whitaker's company had been awarded, and another lender began foreclosure proceedings after Whitaker defaulted on a separate loan for nearly $700,000. Several contractors complained they were not paid, and a process server for one could not even find Whitaker or his company to serve him with a lawsuit.\n\nAfter being appointed last week by President Trump to the nation's top law enforcement job, Whitaker's history as a former federal prosecutor, Republican Party loyalist and critic of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation has come under scrutiny, as have some of his business dealings.\n\nWhitaker is expected to return to his home state Wednesday to speak at a conference at a downtown Des Moines hotel, about two miles from the Ingersoll Avenue apartment building that he once saw as an investment opportunity. After years of rising costs, Whitaker stopped work on the project by early 2016 and sold the building months later.\n\n\"He did not complete the project due to cost overruns and a bad general contractor,\" Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said late Tuesday.\n\nKupec didn't identify the contractor, but a handyman listed in public records as working under Whitaker on the project didn't return a phone message.\n\nCity officials raced to see the project completed to avoid losing federal money, and contractors filed liens seeking compensation for more than $32,000 in unpaid work.\n\nA company formed by Whitaker and two partners, MEM Investment, was awarded a $166,000 city loan to renovate the vacant three-story complex in 2012, through a Department of Housing and Urban Development grant program to promote affordable housing. A reorganization in 2014 made Whitaker the company's sole owner.\n\nAll but $25,000 of the loan would be forgiven as long as the project was completed by 2017 and half of its 22 units were restricted to low-income tenants for five years. But what was once thought to be a $400,000 project for lead testing and site improvements became more expensive as additional work and damage piled up, records show.\n\nWhitaker refinanced his mortgage on the building to get more funding and put an undisclosed amount of his own money into the project.\n\nBeginning in February 2015, city officials said they repeatedly communicated the urgency of finishing the project to Whitaker during meetings, letters and phone calls. But by March 2016, an inspection showed \"there had been minimal, if any, additional rehabilitation work completed since the previous inspection\" several months earlier, city planner Mary Neiderbach wrote to Whitaker on April 1, 2016.\n\n\"In addition, more damage had occurred to the building's interior because of what appears to be a roof leak and missing downspouts on the back of the building,\" she wrote, adding that Whitaker's company \"appears to have abandoned the property.\"\n\nThe letter informed Whitaker that the city was terminating the loan agreement and gave him 30 days to pay back $151,620 that he had been advanced. It noted that the city had to complete the work by the end of 2016 or repay HUD, and that it did not have confidence Whitaker's company was up to that task.\n\nWhitaker did not reply to the city's notice. His lender, Lincoln Savings Bank, soon declared Whitaker's company in default after he ignored demands to pay back a mortgage that had ballooned to $687,000, records show. The bank initiated foreclosure proceedings on the property in July 2016, seeking to be paid back ahead of the city and contractors.\n\nThe contractors included an electrician who filed a lawsuit seeking to collect more than $14,000 in unpaid invoices. A process server said in a court filing that repeated visits to three addresses listed for Whitaker's company and his law firm turned up nothing other than dark, locked offices. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed after both Whitaker and the contractor failed to show up to a scheduled court hearing that had been announced in the newspaper.\n\nWhitaker's company did add value to the building, which it bought for $200,000 in 2012 and sold for $650,000 four years later.\n\nAs part of an exit agreement, Whitaker's company agreed to sell the building to developer Jeff Young, to \"provide a portion of the Lincoln Savings Bank repayment and to settle all contractor liens against the property,\" an August 2016 city memo showed. It's unclear whether the contractors have been repaid in full.\n\nThe memo said Young was expected to complete the project by the looming December 2016 HUD deadline.\n\nKupec said the buyer also assumed Whitaker's loan, and the city didn't take any legal action.\n\nAttorney Jeff Courter, who represented Lincoln Savings Bank, said its foreclosure petition had been resolved but declined to comment further.", "LOS ANGELES -- An Egyptian man was held without bail Tuesday on federal charges of fraudulently collecting insurance payouts after driving his severely autistic children to their deaths when he sped off a pier into the Port of Los Angeles.\n\nAli Elmezayen plotted for over two years before launching his plan into action April 9, 2015, when he barreled down a commercial fishing dock in San Pedro, turned his Honda abruptly toward a parking space and gunned the engine, federal authorities said.\n\n\"Witnesses heard the tires of the car screech loudly and saw the car accelerate before it flew off the edge of the wharf, crashed into the water and immediately sunk,\" FBI agent Matthew Parker wrote in an affidavit in support of Elmezayen's arrest last week.\n\nElmezayen's car window was open, and he surfaced within 30 seconds and swam to a ladder on the pier. His partner, Rabab Diab, couldn't swim, but she was rescued by a fisherman after surfacing and screaming, \"My kids, my kids.\"\n\nTwo boys, Abdelkarim, 8, and Elhassan, 13, couldn't swim and were strapped in child seats. They were pulled lifeless from the car by rescue divers and died from drowning.\n\nElmezayen collected more than $260,000 in insurance payouts for the deaths and wired more than $170,000 back to his native Egypt, prosecutors said.\n\nElmezayen, 44, did not enter a plea in the case in U.S. District Court, but he has told investigators and others he may have accidentally accelerated instead of hitting the brake, according to court papers. He blamed the city, Honda, and Jiffy Lube and others for negligence.\n\n\"In short, there were functionally no precautionary measures taken by any public defendant to this action to prevent a car from plunging into the deep waters below the berth,\" a lawsuit filed in 2016 stated, CBS Los Angeles reported. \"This (also) included a lack of adequate signage or other such warnings to the public.\"\n\nHis lawsuit was tossed out.\n\nThe Los Angeles County district attorney declined to bring charges in the deaths because of insufficient evidence. A police mechanic found evidence that the brake pedal didn't properly work, but couldn't tell if that was the case before the tragedy or because of salt water corrosion.\n\nWhile a county prosecutor said the father's explanation could create reasonable doubt, they suggested police tell federal prosecutors about evidence of insurance and other fraud. Federal investigators said they found that Elmezayen spent about a quarter of his reported $24,000 salary to insure himself, his longtime partner and three sons for $6 million.\n\nElmezayen repeatedly called insurers to confirm they wouldn't automatically investigate a claim made more than two years after a policy was written, federal prosecutors said. The deadly plunge occurred two years and 12 days after the final policy took effect, authorities said.\n\nProsecutors argued that Elmezayen should not be free awaiting trial because he was likely to flee to his homeland. They also argued he still posed a danger to Diab because he had intended to kill her and still pays premiums on her life insurance policy and that of another son, who was at camp when his siblings were killed.\n\nA public defender representing Elmezayen argued that nothing had happened to Diab and the other son in over three years. He asked to have Elmezayen use $250,000 in equity in two houses he owns to secure his bond.\n\nElmezayen and Diab came to the U.S. in 2000 and overstayed their tourist visas, prosecutors said. Both married other partners in hopes of becoming permanent residents. Elmezayen has acknowledged his was a sham marriage.\n\nJudge Alka Sagar said Elmezayen lacked credibility and she denied bail, in part, because of what she called the \"ghastly scheme to obtain insurance benefits.\"", "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said he would support legislation to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller's job, after Democrats said they would step up their effort to shield the Russia investigation in light of the appointment of a new acting attorney general.\n\n\"If we bring it to the floor I'll definitely vote on it,\" Graham, a South Carolina Republican and a close ally of President Trump, told reporters. \"I don't see any movement to fire Mueller but legislatively it'd probably be good to put it into law for the future.\"\n\nGraham's comments represent a bit of daylight between his support for Mr. Trump and his opposition to the Mueller probe. Graham previously said he does not believe the new Acting Attorney General Mathew Whitaker needs to recuse himself from overseeing the matter.\n\nHe told \"Face the Nation\" host Margaret Brennan Sunday, \"I am confident the Mueller investigation will be allowed to come to a good solid conclusion, that there'll be no political influence put on Mr. Mueller by Mr. Whitaker to do anything other than Mr. Mueller's job. I'm confident that Mr. Mueller will be allowed to do his job without interference.\"\n\nThe Mueller protection bill would give any special counsel a 10-day window to seek review of a firing, and ensure that the person was fired for good cause. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said there is no need for it, but other Republicans, like Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, have called for the bill since Whitaker was appointed.\n\nFlake, in comments yesterday to reporters, reiterated his support for the bill. \"The leader has always said there's no need for this because nobody has been fired, the special counsel is fine, but I don't think anybody can say that after Jeff Session's forced removal. It's not that easy to object to this. But if somebody does we can bring it back up again and again. I think we plan to do so.\"\n\nThe legislation, which passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in April, has gotten some new life as the Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, says Democrats will seek to tie it to must-pass legislation if Whitaker did not recuse himself.\n\nWhitaker, a Republican Party loyalist and chief of staff to Sessions, was elevated last week after Mr. Trump forced Sessions out.

In their first national TV interview together, Robinson and Obama tell \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King about their eight years in the White House together and the challenges of raising kids at America's most famous address.\n\nWhen her son-in-law made history as the nation's first African-American president, Robinson admits she was worried about her granddaughters. \"I felt like this was going to be a very hard life for both of them and I\u2026was worried about their safety. And I was worried about my grandkids,\" Robinson said.\n\nIt was that worry for Sasha and Malia that got her to move to D.C., where her daughter admits she needed her, too.\n\n\"I wanted them to come home to family\u2026.there was just parts of the girls' lives that I just knew were going to be okay 'cause Mom was there. When I traveled internationally, grandma was there. When I wasn't home at the end of the day, grandma was there. When the kids were still little and they needed to have someone be with them in school. I mean, you think about my girls were being driven around in a motorcade of three cars with at least four grown adults with guns in each of those cars. And I just thought that that's an unnatural way for a little 2nd grader to go to school. Well, Mom would ride in the car with her to make it feel like a regular carpool,\" Obama said.\n\nLife at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue was a \"huge adjustment\" for Robinson who insisted on doing her own laundry. She also taught her granddaughters how to do it, giving them \"laundry lessons\" as her daughter described it. Even with her low public profile, Obama said her mother became the most \"beloved figure\" in the White House.\n\n\"She had a stream of people. The butlers, the housekeepers.

Now workers are re-doing that part of the recount, making it even more unlikely that legal deadlines will be met.\n\nA mechanic was flown in to fix the problems, but \"we don't have a lot of assurances,\" Palm Beach County Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher told WPTV Tuesday night.\n\nThis is only the latest complication in Florida's legally mandated vote recount, which is drawing national attention, including a stream of tweets from President Donald Trump.\n\nBucher said the county's 11-year-old machines began having problems on Monday as early voting ballots were being counted in the U.S. Senate race. They \"started overheating so as a result the tally types are not reconciling properly.\" And when the totals were added up on Tuesday, they didn't match.\n\nWorkers are feeding ballots into the machines around the clock, but the machines can only tally one race at a time, and Bucher has already said they will not meet the state's Thursday deadline to report the recounted votes.\n\nMeanwhile, lawyers for Democrats planned to ask a federal judge on Wednesday to set aside the state law mandating that mailed-in votes be thrown out if the signature on the envelope doesn't match the signature on file with election authorities.\n\nTrump on Tuesday called on Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson to admit that he lost his re-election bid to Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Trump implied, again without evidence, that officials in two pivotal South Florida counties are trying to steal the election.\n\n\"When will Bill Nelson concede in Florida?\" Trump wrote. \"The characters running Broward and Palm Beach voting will not be able to 'find' enough votes, too much spotlight on them now!\"\n\nThere have been other bumps as Florida undergoes recounts for both the governor and Senate races.\n\nIn oft-criticized Broward County, additional sheriff's deputies were sent to guard ballots and voting machines, a compromise aimed at alleviating concerns. But Broward's supervisor has said the county will meet Thursday's deadline.\n\nNot so in Palm Beach, where Bucher said the machines aren't fast enough. The county is doing the Senate race first and will then do the governor's race. If the deadline is not met in a race, the results it reported Saturday will stand. Both counties are Democratic strongholds.\n\nStill, the state elections department and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, both run by Republican appointees, have said they have seen no evidence of voter fraud. A Broward County judge challenged anyone who has evidence of fraud to file a report.\n\nWhile the counting goes on, there are now four lawsuits pending in a Tallahassee federal court that seek to throw out ballot counting rules or extend deadlines for recounts.\n\nMarc Elias, a campaign attorney for Nelson, argued ahead of the looming court battle that \"we should all be able to agree that the goal here is a legal and accurate count.\" Republicans have responded by contending that Democrats want to bend or skirt existing election laws to alter the outcome.\n\n\"We got to keep the heat on these people to make sure they follow the law,\" said Republican U.S. Rep. Francis Rooney to reporters on a recount update organized by Scott's campaign.\n\nPresidents have historically sought to rise above the heated partisan drama surrounding election irregularities. Former President Barack Obama wasn't so publicly involved when a recount and legal process in the 2008 election delayed a Democrat taking a Minnesota Senate seat until July 2009. Former President Bill Clinton struck a lower tone during the 2000 presidential recount, which also centered on Florida.\n\nBut this Florida recount has been personal for Trump. He aggressively campaigned in the state, putting his finger on the scales of the Republican gubernatorial primary this summer by endorsing former Rep. Ron DeSantis for governor. After Election Day, Trump's aides pointed to the GOP's seeming success in the state as a validation that the president's path to re-election remained clear \u2014 a narrative that has grown hazier as the outcomes have become less certain.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Mercedes Schlapp said Tuesday the president \"obviously has his opinion\" on the recount.\n\n\"It's been incredibly frustrating to watch,\" she said.\n\nU.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump is attempting to bully Florida election officials out of doing their jobs. Schumer and Nelson, both Democrats, spoke with reporters Tuesday in Washington.\n\n\"It's just plain wrong. It's un-American.\" Schumer said. \"If he really wants an honest and fair election, President Trump will stop bullying, harassing and lying about the vote in Florida, and let the election proceed without the heavy hand of the president tipping the scale of justice.\"\n\nState law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points.

Now workers are re-doing that part of the recount, making it even more unlikely that legal deadlines will be met.\n\nA mechanic was flown in to fix the problems, but \"we don't have a lot of assurances,\" Palm Beach County Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher told WPTV Tuesday night.\n\nThis is only the latest complication in Florida's legally mandated vote recount, which is drawing national attention, including a stream of tweets from President Donald Trump.\n\nBucher said the county's 11-year-old machines began having problems on Monday as early voting ballots were being counted in the U.S. Senate race. They \"started overheating so as a result the tally types are not reconciling properly.\" And when the totals were added up on Tuesday, they didn't match.\n\nWorkers are feeding ballots into the machines around the clock, but the machines can only tally one race at a time, and Bucher has already said they will not meet the state's Thursday deadline to report the recounted votes.\n\nMeanwhile, lawyers for Democrats planned to ask a federal judge on Wednesday to set aside the state law mandating that mailed-in votes be thrown out if the signature on the envelope doesn't match the signature on file with election authorities.\n\nTrump on Tuesday called on Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson to admit that he lost his re-election bid to Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Trump implied, again without evidence, that officials in two pivotal South Florida counties are trying to steal the election.\n\n\"When will Bill Nelson concede in Florida?\" Trump wrote. \"The characters running Broward and Palm Beach voting will not be able to 'find' enough votes, too much spotlight on them now!\"\n\nThere have been other bumps as Florida undergoes recounts for both the governor and Senate races.\n\nIn oft-criticized Broward County, additional sheriff's deputies were sent to guard ballots and voting machines, a compromise aimed at alleviating concerns. But Broward's supervisor has said the county will meet Thursday's deadline.\n\nNot so in Palm Beach, where Bucher said the machines aren't fast enough. The county is doing the Senate race first and will then do the governor's race. If the deadline is not met in a race, the results it reported Saturday will stand. Both counties are Democratic strongholds.\n\nStill, the state elections department and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, both run by Republican appointees, have said they have seen no evidence of voter fraud. A Broward County judge challenged anyone who has evidence of fraud to file a report.\n\nWhile the counting goes on, there are now four lawsuits pending in a Tallahassee federal court that seek to throw out ballot counting rules or extend deadlines for recounts.\n\nMarc Elias, a campaign attorney for Nelson, argued ahead of the looming court battle that \"we should all be able to agree that the goal here is a legal and accurate count.\" Republicans have responded by contending that Democrats want to bend or skirt existing election laws to alter the outcome.\n\n\"We got to keep the heat on these people to make sure they follow the law,\" said Republican U.S. Rep. Francis Rooney to reporters on a recount update organized by Scott's campaign.\n\nPresidents have historically sought to rise above the heated partisan drama surrounding election irregularities. Former President Barack Obama wasn't so publicly involved when a recount and legal process in the 2008 election delayed a Democrat taking a Minnesota Senate seat until July 2009. Former President Bill Clinton struck a lower tone during the 2000 presidential recount, which also centered on Florida.\n\nBut this Florida recount has been personal for Trump. He aggressively campaigned in the state, putting his finger on the scales of the Republican gubernatorial primary this summer by endorsing former Rep. Ron DeSantis for governor. After Election Day, Trump's aides pointed to the GOP's seeming success in the state as a validation that the president's path to re-election remained clear \u2014 a narrative that has grown hazier as the outcomes have become less certain.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Mercedes Schlapp said Tuesday the president \"obviously has his opinion\" on the recount.\n\n\"It's been incredibly frustrating to watch,\" she said.\n\nU.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump is attempting to bully Florida election officials out of doing their jobs. Schumer and Nelson, both Democrats, spoke with reporters Tuesday in Washington.\n\n\"It's just plain wrong. It's un-American.\" Schumer said. \"If he really wants an honest and fair election, President Trump will stop bullying, harassing and lying about the vote in Florida, and let the election proceed without the heavy hand of the president tipping the scale of justice.\"\n\nState law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points.

A soldier was severely wounded in the attack.\n\nSchools were closed in Gaza and in southern Israel on Tuesday as the two sides warned each other they would respond forcefully to any further violence.\n\nAfter an Israeli security cabinet meeting that reportedly lasted some six hours on Tuesday, a statement was issued saying the ministers \"instructed the (military) to continue its operations as necessary.\"\n\nMissile defences intercepted more than 100 rockets from Gaza and most others fell in open areas, though some hit houses and other civilian structures.\n\n\"Close call\" as rockets hit Southern Israel\n\nAshkelon is just eight miles from the Gaza border, and as CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported on Tuesday, that makes it an easy target for Palestinian rockets.\n\nD'Agata and his crew saw the aftermath on Tuesday of one of the Hamas rockets, which hit an Israeli house. It blew a hole in the living room wall, where a woman was watching TV when the warning siren rang out.\n\nShe begged her son to come with her to a reinforced safe room in the house, a move which may have saved both of their lives. Just minutes before the explosion, her son was in the shower.\n\n\"That's a close call,\" Baney told D'Agata.\n\n\"Within two seconds (after air sirens) we heard a huge boom, we saw our curtains flying in the air, windows (broken), and only after a few minutes when we went out, we realised that the missile had hit the building next to us,\" a man who lives near a block of flats hit by another rocket in Ashkelon said.\n\nIsrael hit back with major air strikes, with targets including Hamas's Al-Aqsa TV station and internal security headquarters in Gaza City.\n\nThe military said it struck some 160 targets in the enclave.\n\nIsraeli strikes \"like an earthquake\" in Gaza\n\n\"What happened was like an earthquake,\" said Abu Ayman Lemzeni, who lives near the targeted TV building.\n\nAt least five of the dead in Gaza were claimed as members of various militant groups. Some 26 other people were wounded in the Palestinian territory, according to Gaza's health ministry.\n\nThe escalation came despite Netanyahu's decision to allow Qatar to transfer millions of dollars in aid to Gaza for salaries as well as fuel to ease an electricity shortage.\n\nThe agreements had led to calmer protests along the Gaza border after months of deadly unrest.\n\nSunday's special forces operation and resulting clash upset those efforts, leading to questions over the timing of the covert Israeli move.\n\nIsrael said it was an intelligence-gathering operation and that those efforts must continue to defend the country.\n\nIsrael and Palestinian militants in Gaza have fought three wars since 2008, and protests and clashes along the Gaza border since March 30 have repeatedly raised fears of a fourth.\n\nAt least 234 Palestinians in Gaza have since been killed by Israeli fire, the majority during protests and clashes.\n\nTwo Israeli soldiers have been killed over the same period.", "WASHINGTON -- Even as newly-elected members of the House arrived in Washington Wednesday for orientation, Democrats jockeyed behind the scenes in the battle over who the new House speaker should be.\n\nA small but vocal group of returning Democrats is continuing a previous effort to block current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi -- the first woman elected speaker in 2006 --from getting the gavel again.

The group isn't backing or putting forward an alternative to Pelosi; their sole aim is to ensure she's not elected speaker.\n\nCritics of the anti-Pelosi group say it's wrong to try to kick out the highest-ranking woman in Congress in a year that saw hundreds of women run for office and dozens win.\n\n\"I think every single one of us that are part of this effort to forge new leadership are very mindful of the fact that women form a large part of our caucus,\" Rep. Filemon Vela, D-Texas, who opposes Pelosi, told reporters, \"It's difficult to say now but I think every single one of us are motivated to ensure that we have a woman leading the caucus.\"\n\nPelosi's backers are also working to prove she has the necessary support among caucus members. Reps. Rosa DeLauro, D-Ct., is working on a letter from female lawmakers to show their support for the leader.\n\n\"We took the House of Representatives back. It was one individual who worked with many others but as the leader made it happen,\" she told reporters. \"There would not have been an Affordable Care Act without Nancy Pelosi. I was there on economic recovery and we wouldn't have done that. Major, major pieces of legislation that got passed because of the strength of her knowledge, her experience, and the gut about what are the values of this country and what do we need to do. Therefore, she deserves to be speaker of the House.\"\n\nOther backers argue that there's plenty of fresh perspective in the Democratic leadership sitting just below the current trio of Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and Jim Clyburn, D-SC.\n\n\"We're going to have a new generation of leadership. That is going to happen,\" said Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-IL, a Midwesterner who is wrapping up her first two years in leadership and running to chair the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \"We don't just have the top three spots in our leadership.

In his opening remarks, the prosecutor told the jury of seven women and five men in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn this is a case about drugs, money, violence, prison escapes and billions of dollars involved in a criminal enterprise.\n\nGuzman seated at the defense table, flanked by his attorneys and assisted by an interpreter, appeared to listen with rapt attention as prosecutor Adam Fels outlined the government's case against him.\n\nGuzman, 61, has pleaded not guilty to charges involving international drug trafficking, conspiracy to murder, gun and money laundering charges.

He ran the Memphis Noticias online news outlet and reported on the effects of U.S. immigration policies in the Hispanic community. Duran's lawyers have said he came to the U.S. without permission in 2006 after receiving death threats related to reporting on corruption in El Salvador.\n\n\"It's dangerous for me to return to my country,\" he said in Spanish during a conference call.\n\nDuran had been critical of law enforcement in his reporting. Activists say he faced retaliation for it. Memphis police have repeatedly denied those allegations, saying officers arrested Duran after an order to clear the street was given.\n\nDuran said he was just doing his job as a journalist when he was arrested.\n\n\"I was doing the right thing,\" he said.\n\nIn October, the Board of Immigration Appeals in Virginia denied an appeal in the case. Duran's lawyer, Michelle Lapointe, said he could be deported within two weeks if the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta does not agree to delay his removal and reopen his deportation case. A ruling is pending.\n\nLapointe, who works with the Southern Poverty Law Center, said she will ask for asylum for Duran if the court does agree to open his case because reporters are facing worsening conditions in El Salvador.\n\nDuran was issued a deportation order in 2007 after he failed to show up for court. His lawyers have said that he did not receive notice to report to court before the deportation order was issued.\n\nAfter Duran's April 3 arrest, disorderly conduct and obstruction of a highway charges were dropped. Authorities in Memphis then handed him over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\n\"We would not be in this situation if he had not been targeted for exercising his First Amendment rights reporting the news that was critical of local policies and ICE policies that harmed his community,\" Lapointe said.\n\nDuran was transferred from Memphis to an ICE facility in Louisiana. Duran said he has experienced poor conditions, including bad food and dirty bathrooms with no toilet paper, in ICE facilities in Louisiana.\n\nICE spokesman Bryan Cox denied Duran's allegations. Cox said the facility where Duran is being held in Jena, Louisiana, has been inspected by multiple groups and has passed inspection.\n\nDuran's lawyers have sought his release from ICE custody as they fight his deportation. Duran's longtime partner, Melisa Valdez, said the past months without Duran have been \"a nightmare.\"\n\nShe said Duran is not a criminal and is not a danger to the Memphis community.\n\n\"His arrest and detainment only show the government has displaced priorities,\" Valdez said during the conference call. \"I find it extremely unfair that someone can be jailed indefinitely without committing a crime.\"", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "CBS NEWS - WASHINGTON BUREAU\n\nINTELLIGENCE MATTERS - ERIC EDELMAN\n\nINTERVIEW WITH ERIC EDELMAN\n\nCORRESPONDENT: MICHAEL MORELL\n\nPRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS\n\nMEDIA ID: 1113 INTELLIGENCE MATTERS RAW RECORDING.MP3\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nEric, thanks for taking the time to be with us today. Great to have you on the show and to talk about the just released, just today report of the National Defense Strategy Commission.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nGreat to be here with you.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nI need to start by telling our listeners that I am not an unbiased interviewer here. I myself was a member of the commission-- and a member who believes deeply in the conclusions that we reached. And I want the listeners to know that, and I want there to be full transparency here as to-- as to my bias. And to try to compensate a little bit for that, Eric, I'm gonna try to ask some questions that a critic of the report might ask, okay?\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nFair enough.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nI also want to note that you are one of two co-chairs of the commission. We tried to work out schedules so that your counterpart, the other co-chair, Admiral Gary Roughhead, former chief of Naval Operations, could join us today, but that didn't work out. But I wanted to note Gary's important role in the commission, and I know you want to do that as well.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nAbsolutely. He's been fabulous co-chair, and the-- good thing about it is, I think he and I have all through this process been very much, you know, on the same wavelength and have seen things the same way, as did you and all the other commissioners. I mean, one of the things that was really great about this experience was how not only bipartisan it was, but how nonpartisan it was.\n\nAnd I think if your listeners had been able to, you know, be a fly on the wall for our deliberations over the last year-plus-- they would have had a hard time figuring out who had been nominated to this commission by Republican members of the House and Senate and who by the Democrats. Because it was a truly serious group of professionals wrestling with very difficult issues.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nIt's the way Washington should work.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nOne would hope.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nOkay, Eric. The, perhaps the place to start is to ask, what is the National Defense Strategy Commission? And what was its charter?\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nSo the congress going back almost 20 years has periodically appointed independent commissions to give it a second opinion on the strategies and particularly the strategy documents that the Department of Defense has produced pursuant to legislation.\n\nSo it was the case that after the end of the Cold War the Department of Defense stated producing quadrennial defense reviews. In 2010 and 2014, congress appointed a commission to review those Q.D.R. documents. And in accord with some of the recommendations that came out of the 2014 commission, the congress actually changed the legislative requirement on the Department of Defense and said, \"We want you to produce not a Q.D.R. but a National Defense Strategy.\"\n\nBut they also appointed a commission to provide some input into that strategy from a group of national security professionals appointed by members of congress, but also then to, as with the other commissions provide them with an expert second opinion on the strategy produced by the DOD\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd that was us.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nAnd that was us.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd the report is to the congress?\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nIt is to the congress. I mean, it is-- in the legislation, it originally was to the president and to the Secretary of Defense as well. And of course both the White House and the Department of Defense have received advanced copies of the report.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd congress has it as well?\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nThe congress has advanced copies as well, and they have had it for several days.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd I know that you and Gary are scheduled to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee in a few weeks.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nOn November 27th, we'll be testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House Armed Services Committee yet to be scheduled, but we're working on scheduling a hearing date there as well.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd the last question before we jump into the report. Where can the public find a copy of this?\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nThe, it will be posted on the web. And-because U.S.I.P., the U.S. Institute of Peace has hosted us, I think you can look there, and you will be able to find a copy, a downloadable copy of the report.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nGreat. So Eric, what I'd like to do with the rest of the interview is walk through the commission's view of the state of our military. Talk about why the commission believes the situation has evolved in the way it has. And then discuss what the commission recommends we do about all of that. Does that make sense?\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd with that outline in mind let's dig in on where we find ourselves today. And let me start by reading four quotes from the executive summary. \"First, the security and wellbeing of the United States than at any time in decades. America's military superiority has eroded to a dangerous degree. Second, many of the skills necessary to plan for and conduct military operations against capable adversaries have atrophied.\"\n\n\"Third, America's edge is diminishing or has disappeared in many key technologies that underpin U.S. military superiority. And fourth,\" and kinda the punchline, \"these trends are undermining deterrents of U.S. adversaries and the confidence of American allies, thus increasing the likelihood of military conflict. The U.S. military could suffer unacceptably high casualties and the loss of major capital assets in its next conflict. It might struggle to win or perhaps lose the war against China or Russia.\"\n\nSo those are stark, even grim words. Couple of questions about all of that. First is, can you give us a concrete example of the situation that we find ourselves in? Either talking about the Baltics or Taiwan or something else to put this in context for folks?\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nSo, if I could, let me kind of pull the camera back a little bit, and because I suffer from the deficiency that I'm a recidivist on this panel. I was also on the 2010 and 2014 panel, so I watched three panels, and this one I got to be a co-chair on. But I've watched three panels wrestle with these issues over the better part of the decade.\n\nAnd in the 2010 report the commission, the then independent commissioner reviewed the Q.D.R., concluded that budget cuts and an increasingly complex international environment were leading to a potential train wreck. And then in 2014 and that was, first report was before the Budget Control Act of 2011. In 2014, in the aftermath of the Budget Control Act, we said that the B.C.A. was a strategic misstep that was disabling the U.S. because it was facing greater challenges around the world. And we quoted then Secretary of Defense Hagel saying that, \"Our margin of superiority vis-\u00e0-vis our potential great power competitors, Russia and China was declining.\"\n\nAnd in this report, I think what we had to wrestle with was the consequences of all those warnings having been ignored. And so we have over a very long period of time been engaged since 9/11 and you and I were both part of this, in a very long conflict with irregular forces, with terrorist forces around the world.\n\nWe've gotten extremely good at combating those kinds of terrorist forces, and I would say the proof is in the pudding, which is since 9/11, the United States has not suffered a similar mass casualty attack of that kind. And it's not for lack of trying by our adversaries, as you yourself have written about.\n\nIn that time, however Russia and China in particular, but other actors in the international arena, particularly would be nuclear powers, a new nuclear power in North Korea and a would-be nuclear power in Iran, have studied the way that we fight and that we're prepared to fight, and have developed a suite of capabilities that are meant to in an asymmetric way be able to counter the kinds of things we can do. So, for instance, you have seen, in the case of China, the development of very robust set of capabilities. Anti-ship cruise missiles, anti-ship ballistic missiles that create what strategists call-- anti-access area denial problem. What that means is that we can't fight traditionally the way we have fought which is to--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nMeant to keep us away.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nIt's meant to keep us further away, push us further out into the Pacific, away from the Asian literal. And the way we have traditionally dealt with great power aggressors, the way we did, for instance, in the Gulf War was, the aggression occurs, and then we come in with unimpeded access, both by air and sea.\n\nWe build up a so-called iron mountain. We, you know, load up our troops, we load up our equipment, and then we go and reverse the aggression. And with Russia and China we find that they are developing capabilities precisely meant to preclude our ability to do that.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThey've learned from it--\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nThey've learned from what we've done. They've learned from our success. And while we've been off doing a different kind of warfare, they've been prepared for a kind of warfare at the high end that we really haven't engaged in for a very long time.\n\nAnd which we have not been training for. And therefore our forces have not maintained the kind of proficiency that you would like to see in in that kind of warfare were it to become necessary. And where those shrinking margins might entice-- a future Russian leader or future Chinese leader to think, \"I can take these actions because the Americans are unlikely to respond, because they are not as capable of responding as they once were.\"\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYou mentioned the 2010, 2014 reports-- both review panels on which you served. And I had my assistant go through both of them. And she cited exactly what you cited. A 2010 report provided quote, \"an explicit warning that things were heading in the wrong direction.\" 2014, the warning got stronger. What really strikes me about our report is the extraordinary strong sense of urgency about where we now are.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nYou know, I think for a lot of reasons both the American public and members of congress have not been as attentive to this set of issues as they ought to be. One reason is, Americans in general have paid less attention to the world than other countries have historically.\n\nAnd I think there's been a disposition to believe that we spend so much money on defense that, you know, obviously we should be able to deal with all comers. But what I think people have lost sight of is that the international environment has just become so much more complicated.\n\nDuring the Cold War, we had one major superpower adversary. And everything else we dealt with was in some sense a lesser included case of the overall U.S.-Soviet confrontation. And that provided a kind of ordering mechanism for thinking your way through problems. Sometimes our leaders thought through them better and sometimes worse. And we weren't always successful, but at least we had a framework that made it possible to kinda go through a decision tree and make reasonable decisions about national security issues.\n\nToday, we face both two great power challengers, one in Asia, one in Europe. We have a new nuclear power in North Korea that is developing a larger, more capable arsenal I think than almost anybody anticipated. I think most people anticipated that North Korea would develop a handful of weapons in order to hold off America's overwhelming conventional power and prevent a forcible regime change of the Kim family dynasty.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSimple deterrent on their part.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nSimple deterrent. But now it looks like they're developing all the appurtenances of a nuclear triad with mobile I.C.B.M. and a submarine launched I.C.B.M. And numerical arsenal that could run as high, if you look at the higher-end calculations of where they might go in unclassified sources, could be, you know, as close to the size of the U.K.'s arsenal.\n\nThat's a different-order problem I think than most people had anticipated, which is why I hope President Trump and Secretary Pompeo and Steve Biegun, my former colleague are successful in their endeavor. I have some doubts about it, but I hope they're successful in defanging that particular threat. And then we have the threat from Iran which is destabilizing an entire region, and that's had plenty of news focused on it in the last few weeks of course.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd developing their own significant military capabilities.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nDeveloping their own capabilities, in many ways aping a lot of these capabilities at a different context-- a Gulf context, but similar anti-access, area denial-- capabilities to try and push U.S. forces further and further away from the Gulf.\n\nAnd then we have all the steady state activity that we continue to have to engage in to deal with the jihadist threat, which remains. A threat from, you know-- radical Islamist, violent extremists-- is going to be a persistent one that we're going to have to maintain an eye on as well--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo you've looked at the U.S. defense needs for a long time. Is this the worst you've seen it? Is there a comparable time in the post-war-- post-World War II period that you can think of? How does this compare?\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nI can't think of a time where the international security environment was as complicated as it was, and places as many potential conflicting demands on U.S. forces as this situation could, you know, in extremis inflict on us.\n\nAnd I think that's one of the challenges that our colleagues in the Pentagon have had. You, they have to be prepared potentially for a fight tonight on the North-- in the Korean Peninsula with North Korea. That-- that's something they've had to be prepared for for a long time. But they now also have to be prepared for potential activities by China, whether in the East China Sea or the South China Sea, Taiwan.\n\nThey've gotta worry about Iran because of the Russian activities beginning in 2008 really, the invasion of Georgia and the annexation of Abkhazia and Ossetia. There has been a reawakening of awareness that Russia poses a threat to its neighbors.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd now Ukraine.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nAnd now Ukraine. The seizure of Crimea and its incorporation into Russia and violation of Russia's international undertakings. And the potential threat to the Baltics, which are NATO allies and have an Article V guarantee. All of those things are things that the Department of Defense has to be prepared for while they're also out hunting and killing terrorists.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah, so here's I think-- a really important question, and I know we talked about this in the commission, which is the ability to articulate why the average American should care about all this, right? You know, for many Americans, and I certainly see this traveling around the country, there's a view that the U.S. has its own problems here at home.\n\nWe should focus on those. Those should be the priority. We shouldn't pay the high price necessary to lead in the world and therefore we don't need the kind of military power we're talking about in this report. How do you respond to that?\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nWell, it's a fair question. And it's one that I think the national security elite, and very much this is, you know, as much self-criticism as it is criticism of anybody else, has not done a very good job of making this case to this broader public since the Cold War ended. And we tend to talk about it in terms of sort of bloodless abstractions. Like, the liberal, normative rules-based order, which doesn't mean very much to most people.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nOr global stability.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nOr global stability. I mean, what we're really talking about is a system of trading relationships and a system of political military alliances that, at the end of World War II, the U.S. created. And they created them to manage the world really in a way that would hopefully first-- prevent Communist power from expanding and becoming dominant, which at the end of World War II it looked like it might well do. Both in Europe and in Asia, particularly after the revolution in China in 1949.\n\nAnd also to allow the international economy that had been devastated by the most costly war in history, both in lives and in treasure had laid waste the economy, both in Asia and in Europe. And the United States was largely responsible for creating a set of institutions that made it possible for trade to resume and for economic growth to occur. And it led to the so-called \"European miracle,\" the rebirth of Europe. A prosperous, peaceful Europe instead of one that was challenging the peace of the world twice in the 20th century.\n\nIt led to the development of industrial powerhouse in Japan and then the rise of the so-called \"Asian Tiger\" economies. It led to the longest period of great power peace and prosperity in the history of the world. So this is really about maintaining peace and maintaining prosperity of Americans--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd U.S. military power underpins all of that.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nAll of that depended on the fact that the United States was the preeminent military power in the world.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd it's your view, I don't want to put words in your mouth. But it's your view that if we don't have that, and we don't lead in the world, then our prosperity will suffer. There will be conflict in the world in which we will inevitably get drawn into. And that's going to cost lives. Is that fair--\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nI'm glad you put the words in my mouth, because I put, couldn't have put them better. (LAUGH)\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo the second issue is why we're here. You've talked a little bit about that already in terms of how our adversaries have changed and advanced and grown. But the report also talks about developments here at home. In particular what's going on in terms of the budget. Can you talk about that a little bit?\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nWell. Again, I think one has to-- you know, pull back the lens a little bit, because otherwise we, you know, get into the dangerous territory which we frequently do here in Washington of, you know, being like an amnesiac trying to understand, you know, how they got to where they are.\n\nAt the end of the Cold War, the United States essentially took a peace dividend. We began to cut the defense budget from the kind of high levels that we had had during the Cold War, and in one sense that was completely understandable. But it also coincided with a period in which the U.S. operational tempo for the military got a lot higher. I mean, we were intervening in Somalia. We were intervening in Bosnia. We were intervening in Kosovo. We were-dealing with lots of-- Haiti. We were dealing with lots of different challenges to order.\n\nWe were the sole superpower. It was the so-called \"unipolar moment,\" and really nobody else could take on these challenges or organize the response, and we ended up doing it. So at the same time that we were cutting defense, the operational tempo was increasing, which meant that we were not investing in future capability. After 9/11, when we began to deal with the war on terror we ended up chewing through even more of the capital stock, the equipment-- the force structure as the Pentagon calls it-- that we had inherited, essentially from the Reagan defense buildup.\n\nAnd then while we did have-- you know, some increases in defense during the years, early years of the war on terror, when the change of administrations came, there was a downturn in defense spending, which was then compounded by the Budget Control Act, which ended up cutting even more out of prospective defense budgets. And that means that we have basically been underfunding the Defense Department for quite a period of time--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThis was a deal between the Obama White House and the Republicans in congress.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nRight. This is, I mean there's plenty of blame to go around about this. I mean, both sides agreed to it. As my former colleague at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments now at C.S.I.S., Todd Harrison, used to like to say, \"The problem with the Budget Control Act was it took the defense budget hostage,\" in part because President Obama thought that if he took the defense budget hostage, the Republicans in congress would agree to increase taxes.\n\nAnd the Republicans in congress thought that if they held the defense budget, they could get Obama to agree to different things that they wanted in the in the budget. And as Todd used to say, \"Problem is, you know, if two people take someone hostage, it usually doesn't work out well for the hostage.\"\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight, and certainly that's the case here. So I want to move on to what do we do about all this? But before we get to that, part of our charter as a commission was to assess how the Pentagon is thinking about this, right? To actually look at their national defense strategy and assess it. And can you talk about where we came out on that? That's kind of important.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nSo the Pentagon's strategy, which Secretary Mattis rolled out, first of all-- was nested beneath a national security strategy, overarching strategy that President Trump announced in December of 2017 that was prepared under General McMaster, when he was the national security advisor.\n\nAnd what both those documents did and both those strategies did was raise in priority, although it had been recognized certainly by members of the previous administration, particularly Secretary Ash Carter, Secretary of Defense Carter in the Obama administration-- he recognized that we were increasingly in competition with great powers. And we were back in that kind of great power competition business with China and Russia.\n\nThe national security strategy and the national defense strategy took that insight and took it a little further and said, these are actually long-term security competitions that we're in. And they're going to really be the defining competitions of potential military conflict in the 21st century. And so we have to reprioritize, shift our priorities around a bit in the Department of Defense to focus more on those long-term challenges. And I think that's a reorientation that we on the commission I think unanimously agreed with. That is the correct focus for the, both the national security strategy and also the national defense strategy of the United States.\n\nSo I think we are largely in agreement with the objectives of the strategy. And we can talk more about the other findings we have. But the general vector that we have to be-- first of all prioritizing long-term competition with Russia and China while being mindful of these other threats that we have been discussing this morning, and which include North Korea, Iran, jihadism-- that has to be the way that the United States-- conducts itself in the world.\n\nAnd in particular, that we need to maintain a balance of power in Europe, in Asia, and in the Middle East that is conducive to American interests. And that is-- I think-- a formal recognition of something that essentially has been an informal part of American grand strategy since the end of the Second World War.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThe critique though, right, was while the vector is right, there's not a strong sense in the national defense strategy about how to get there.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nYes. So I think the concerns we had about the strategy-- there were several, and we could spend time on any one of them. We could probably spend a podcast on each one, but first the strategy needs to be adequately resourced. And I would, that's my personal view, I would place that first.\n\nAnd in that context Secretary Mattis and Chairman Dunford, before they produced the national defense strategy testified before congress that in order to execute the strategy they had-- inherited, Secretary Mattis inherited under President Obama that was the so-called Defense Strategic Guidance of 2012, that strategy they believed was going to require additional resources for the Department of Defense beyond what the Budget Control Act caps allow.\n\nThey were talking about 3% to 5% annual real growth. I think it was our judgment that this new strategy is clearly more ambitious than the earlier strategy, which was largely just a kind of refocus towards Asia from Europe and was-actually written before Russia invaded Crimea and Eastern Ukraine and before it became completely clear where North Korea was going with its nuclear program.\n\nSo the resource level has to be commensurate with the objectives of the strategy. And we were unable I think to put an exact number. I'm not sure we would have agreed as a commission as the exact number, but we certainly could say that you need to have greater resources devoted, if you're going to execute this strategy.\n\nAnd we also I think faulted, and this is not the Department of Defense's fault, but the congress and the executive branch for not taking action to get out of this Budget Control Act trap of arbitrary caps on defense and a series of continuing resolutions, rather than regular order in budgeting, so that the Department of Defense can have predictable, appropriate funding to execute the strategy. That was the first gap we saw.\n\nThe second gap I think we identified is that, there was-- it wasn't clear from the strategy itself what kinds of operational concepts we would use in the future to fight these more able competitors. And therefore, we were directing in essence the congress to say, \"This is one area where your oversight responsibilities are important.\" You need to be.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThis is the how to fight.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nThis is the how to fight piece, and you need to be pressing the Department of Defense to tell you what kind of novel, creative ways, because even if you get all the funding that we would want, even-- I probably, maybe I and one or two other commissioners would probably be at the high end of what we would be willing to spend on defense among the commissioners. That even if I got everything I would want-- that's not gonna be enough. We are also gonna have to fight differently, fight smarter, and we are base--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nExactly what the Chinese and Russians are doing, right?\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nExactly, we gotta-- we've gotta match the kind of intellectual fire power they're bringing to the problem with that kind of fire power of our own, and we were directing the congress to say, \"This is where you ought to be holding the Department of Defense's feet to the fire to make sure that that the strategy is executable.\"\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah. So on the resource piece-- 3% to 5% real growth is a huge dollar figure over a period of years. And we did not take a position on where that money should come from. But stepping out of your role as the co-chair of this thing, where is that money gonna come from?\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nWell, we do address some of the issues that-- that are raised by the resource question. First, if you look at the long-term budget projections of the Congressional Budget Office, the C.B.O., it's very clear what's driving the long-term deficits. And that is, the entitlement programs of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.\n\nThat makes up the bulk of it. Defense is, you know, part of the so-called discretionary budget that congress gets to play with. And it's only about 25% of that budget. Yet it's been varying under the B.C.A. 50%, you know, of the cuts. Clearly, I think where this money has to come from is some combination of reform of entitlements and revenue.\n\nAnd speaking personally I'm willing to bear a higher tax burden in order to make sure that the, we can defend the United States. I think it's the first obligation that the constitution imposes on the congress, which is to provide for the common defense, which is part of our title.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah, and at the end of the day, it's part of the responsibility of the leaders of the country, both the president and the congress to make the case to the American people why that's important.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nWhy that's important, exactly. And we talked about that.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYou know, we spend some time talking about technology and the fact that the rest of the world has caught up. Critically with regard to technologies that are important to the military. And there's a very interesting line in our report that recommends, and I'll quote here, \"pursuing selective economic disintegration with rivals to avoid dangerous dependencies.\" What does that mean? What does that look like?\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nSo one of the things that-- you know, has become clear and which we delved into as part of our deliberations was the degree to which the supply chain for the major defense contractors who provide the weaponry and the equipment for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, the men and women of all of our military services have dependency on-- in particular on things made in China.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThis is a consequence of globalization and?\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nYeah, this is not anybody's fault. This is just-- you know, a consequence of.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nHow the world economy works.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nThe world economy works, the law of comparative advantage and labor rates and the comparative labor rates, what have you. But we want to make, we need to make sure we have to as a country make sure we don't find ourselves in a position where one of our adversaries could throw a monkey wrench into our ability to defend ourselves.\n\nAnd so we may have to do some things that would, you know, require us maybe to not buy the cheapest product but the one that we have the most control over, in order to prevent that you know, from happening. And I think that's-- I'm glad you highlighted that, because I think that's something that hasn't gotten as much attention as it should. But there's a whole--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd something that's going to require private sector understanding at the end of the day.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nThat's a very important point. You know, we, in-- in the Cold War era-- a lot of commercial development came on the back of, you know, military technical development. So I mean when you and I were growing up, you know -- Tang was a product that came out of the space program. You know, sort of a freeze-dried orange juice that you could stir into a glass of water, which had been originally produced for astronauts.\n\nI mean, so a lot of commercial aviation grew on the back of the military. And that's now reversed-- particularly because of the importance of information technology. And so the Department of Defense and the military are going to be much more dependent on the commercial world.\n\nAnd we've already seen instances where there has been some resistance on parts of the tech community to working with the U.S. government and particularly the Department of Defense, of people objecting to companies bidding on the DoD Cloud for instance, or opposing participation in the DoD so-called Maven program. Those are issues that we're going to have to wrestle with as a society.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd-- maybe this is a good place to-- I just want to ask two more questions about the report, and maybe this is a great place to ask the first one. This is not just DoD's issue. Right? This is, and-- in some cases it's not even just the federal government's issue. This is a whole of government, a whole of society issue when you think about education, when you think about this private sector-government relationship that has to happen here. So this is not just the Defense Department at the end of the day.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nWell, I couldn't agree more. So first, the strategy, the national defense strategy, national security strategy argued that we have these long-term competitions with Russia and China that the United States has to position itself to be able to prevail in.\n\nBut I think we as a commission were impressed by the fact that we're actually not just in competition with these countries. In some areas like cyber, we're actually in conflict with them every day. And that's ongoing, and it's happening now. And a lot of those competitions, this goes on in the so-called \"gray zone--\" whether it's a functional or geographic gray zone. A lot of that competition is not particularly the province of the Department of Defense.\n\nI mean, in some cases, it's because China relies on so-called private fishing fleet or maritime militias that are not military. They're more sort of police forces that are not strictly speaking, you know, a counterpart to our military forces. And so a lot of these activities are not things that are necessarily in the Department of Defense's gambit. They're either part of the intelligence community, the State Department, other departments of the government treasury, et cetera.\n\nSo you're right, and this is going to take a whole of government effort. And I'm glad you said whole of society, because some of the challenges we face, particularly as new technologies come online, and I have in mind things like hypersonics and artificial intelligence-- quantum computing, areas where Russia and China, particularly China are putting enormous amount of effort into. And that's going to require commensurate effort from the United States. And a lot of that's going to rest on our educational system, not just the Department of Defense.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight. So just one more question Eric, aand maybe it's a little unfair.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nThose are the best kind.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nBut given everything you just talked about, are you optimistic or pessimistic that the United States as a nation, that incoming congress, future congresses, current administration, future administrations are going to get this right?\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nIt's-- I am by nature and have always been a very optimistic person. And certainly when you look at the history of the United States, we have been an incredibly resilient nation. Overcoming a devastating Civil War that, you know, cost 600,000 lives. Overcoming the history of slavery and racial bigotry that marked our country.\n\nWe've made enormous strides as a nation. And coming back from the Great Depression, winning the Second World War with the greatest generation. So we've historically been very resilient and able to come back from either setbacks or defeats of one sort or another. So I hope that we will be able to rise to this challenge, which is as we've been discussing a serious challenge and a complicated challenge.\n\nYou know, one thing that gives me a little bit of hope is the way our own commission operated. As you said at the outset, you know, this is the way you would want, you know, Washington to work, which is for the good of the country with party not really being a factor. And it's there that I have my greatest worries about whether we will again rise to this challenge and continue our history of national resilience.\n\nAnd that is, that our political institutions have become more brittle-- and more tribal. And I hope that we can move beyond that so that the country can come together. I noted with some interest that a number of the new members of the House who were elected in the election on Tuesday have military service in their backgrounds.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd intelligence.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nAnd intelligence. And-- exactly, and so I'm hoping that that new cohort will bring to it a country before party approach that will help us get through this very difficult period that we're going to be heading into.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThat's going to be necessary to get done.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nAll the things we've talked about--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAll the things we've talked about. Eric, thank you so much for joining us. It's going to be fascinating to see what kind of attention the report gets.\n\nERIC EDELMAN:\n\nThank you so much for having me in today. And I look forward to working with you and other commissioners to try and make people understand what we, what kind of challenge we have ahead of us. It's a big one.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThank you.", "Having spent a fortune to help elect Democrats this fall, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg declared his lifetime allegiance to the Democratic Party on Tuesday and outlined an aggressive timeline for deciding whether to run for president. Bloomberg registered as a Democrat in October.\n\n\"I think January, February would be about as late as you can do it and as early as you can gather enough information,\" Bloomberg told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\nThe 76-year-old billionaire said his decision would have little to do with other Democratic presidential prospects. He conceded that \"it's much too early to tell\" whether he has a legitimate chance of winning the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 and, with it, the chance to take on another New York billionaire, President Donald Trump. Bloomberg's net worth is currently estimated to be $46 billion, according to Forbes, considerably higher than the president's, at about $3 billion.\n\n\"Thanksgiving, Christmas and then maybe a few weeks into January \u2014 that's when you really gotta sit down, talk to your advisers and say, 'Look, do I have a chance?' I think I know why I would want to run. I think I know what I think this country should do and what I would do. But I just don't know whether it's possible,\" Bloomberg told the AP.\n\nHe added, \"If people don't seem to be warming to you, there's plenty of other ways that I can make a difference in life and say thank you to this country for what it's given my kids and me.\"\n\nShould he run, Bloomberg would bring virtually limitless resources and a pragmatic governing approach to what is expected to be a massive 2020 Democratic field. Hardly a far-left liberal, he is described by his team as socially progressive and business-minded. He has spent tens of millions of dollars to promote liberal priorities on climate change, gun control and immigration.\n\nIt's unclear, however, whether there's room for Bloomberg in today's Democratic Party. There are over a dozen Democrats considering a run for president, as well as two who have already declared. The former mayor is likely to face stiff competition if he decides to run, particularly from candidates who have a stronger record of progressive legislation.\n\nCBS News / James Morris\n\nTom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, offered a lukewarm assessment this week when asked about Bloomberg's $110 million investment in his party's 2018 midterm efforts.\n\n\"I applaud everybody who was involved,\" Perez said in an interview. \"Very appreciative of Mayor Bloomberg. Equally appreciative of those grassroots activists who were knocking on doors every weekend, texting people, investing 50 bucks in the Democratic Party.\"\n\nStill, Bloomberg endeared himself to many Democratic leaders in recent months after deciding to invest more than $110 million in the 2018 midterms \u2014 largely focused on House races. Long an active political donor to candidates in both parties, Bloomberg gave almost exclusively to Democrats this year for the first time. In the final weeks of before the election, Bloomberg's PAC sent out a nationwide ad urging voters to support Democrats.\n\nThe decision, he explained, was born out of his concern that Republicans who controlled the House and Senate weren't providing an adequate check on the Trump presidency. Yet this political season marked a permanent shift in his political identity, he said.\n\n\"I will be a Democrat for the rest of my life,\" Bloomberg said.\n\nInitially registered as a Democrat, the Massachusetts native filed paperwork to change his voter registration to Republican in 2000 before his first run for New York City mayor, according to a spokesman. He was elected mayor as a Republican. In June 2007, he un-enrolled from the GOP, having no formal party affiliation until he registered again as a Democrat this October.\n\nMonths before that, Bloomberg directed his political team to work hand in hand with leading Democratic allies to shape the first nationwide election of Trump's presidency. His top aides even shared office space at times in the campaign's final days with the super PAC aligned with top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi.\n\nUltimately, Bloomberg's preferred candidates won all but three of two dozen targeted House races, focused overwhelmingly in America's suburbs.\n\nOnce it became clear Democrats seized the House majority, he said he delivered a stern message to Pelosi.\n\n\"I've said to Nancy Pelosi: 'We don't expect you to do the same thing to the Republicans that the Republicans were doing to you. We want to have people working across the aisle for the benefit of America rather than for the benefit of their party,'\" Bloomberg said.\n\nThat's a message Pelosi herself has articulated in recent weeks. Bloomberg reinforced it again in person on Tuesday as Pelosi met with his board of directors in private.\n\n\"I said, sitting next to her, without mincing words, I said, 'You know, we expect you to do a good job,'\" Bloomberg said. \"That's why we supported the Democrats.\"\n\nDemocratic officials poised to play leading roles in the next presidential election took notice of Bloomberg's investment.\n\nGuy Cecil, chairman of the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, described Bloomberg's midterm effort as \"incredibly helpful.\" It's unclear, however, whether Democratic voters who might favor younger, more liberal candidates in 2020 will see him any differently.\n\n\"Democrats appreciate how much he has invested and how much his team has been engaged in the cycle, but ultimately it's going to be about what Bloomberg's vision is for the future,\" Cecil said.\n\nBloomberg acknowledged he has already formulated his justification for a presidential bid, but he declined to share it when asked. Still, he offered a message to any critics who might not think he belongs in today's Democratic Party.\n\n\"I don't think anybody has done more on the environment, on gun safety, on immigration, go right down the list,\" Bloomberg said. \"I was the one who stood up for gay marriage long before it became popular. I was the one at the national convention who said Trump was a con man. If you find anybody that's done more on these issues than I have, and the people that I've been lucky enough to work with, please give me a call. I'd like to hire 'em.\"\n\nBloomberg also considered an independent presidential bid in 2016 but concluded that he couldn't win enough electoral votes, and worse, \"There is a good chance that my candidacy could lead to the election of Donald Trump or Senator Ted Cruz. That is not a risk I can take in good conscience,\" he said in March 2016. \"I love our country too much to play a role in electing a candidate who would weaken our unity and darken our future -- and so I will not enter the race for president of the United States.\"", "ASHKELON, Israel \u2014 Israeli airstrikes lit up the sky over Gaza in an escalation not seen here since 2014.

On Tuesday, a trial begins in New York City to hold him accountable.\n\n60 Minutes correspondent Bill Whitaker has been covering the almost-mythical criminal pedigree of the Mexican drug lord since he was captured in Mexico in 2014. Here are some of those reports.\n\n2014: Public Enemy Number 1 is caught\n\nWhen Mexican marines captured Guzm\u00e1n in 2014, he had been on 13-year run from the law after escaping from a Mexican prison in 2001. He was the most wanted man in the world; his international drug cartel put him at the top of the list.\n\n\"Making billions of dollars, having a reach around the world in Asia, Australia, in Africa, in Europe; putting poison on the streets, not just in the United States, but all over the world,\" Derek Maltz told Whitaker. Maltz was in charge of the DEA's Special Operations Division tasked with finding Guzm\u00e1n.\n\nAfter years of independent searching, Mexican law enforcement had teamed up with several U.S. law enforcement agencies to track the drug lord. After streamlining their efforts, the group tracked Guzm\u00e1n to a non-descript house in the midst of a middle-class Mexican neighborhood. But as soon as the Mexican marines arrived, Guzm\u00e1n escaped down a tunnel underneath his bathtub.\n\nMaltz feared the drug lord would continue evading arrest. \"I never believed that he would ever be captured,\" he said.\n\nBut the Mexican marines were relentless. With the help of American law enforcement, they tracked Guzm\u00e1n to a beachfront building in Mazatl\u00e1n, where they finally captured him and arrested him.\n\n\"We did not ever anticipate that he'd be captured alive,\" said Jim Dinkins, who was head of Homeland Security Investigations and had pursued Guzm\u00e1n for more than a decade. \"We thought he'd fight to the death.\"\n\n2015: \"El Chapo\" escapes from prison\n\nGuzm\u00e1n had already escaped from prison once. In 2015, he did it again.\n\nAlmost from the moment he was delivered to Altiplano Prison, a maximum security facility in Mexico, a construction crew from his Sinaloa cartel began digging a tunnel to free him. From almost a mile away, Guzm\u00e1n's men dug down about three stories and then burrowed 4,921 feet straight toward Altiplano. The tunnel went under the prison wall and beneath the plumbing \u2014 and with remarkable accuracy, emerged straight into Guzm\u00e1n's shower stall.\n\n\"It's very difficult to navigate underground,\" Dinkins said. \"This tunnel, I believe, went from point A to point B with only minor deviations, if any. And that is an engineering marvel in and of itself.\"\n\nDEA Chief Chuck Rosenberg told Whitaker how he thought it might be possible: corruption and bribes within Mexican law enforcement.\n\n\"I don't know specifically how high up they reach,\" Rosenberg said. \"My sense is that they're both broad and deep, that they go throughout the Mexican government.\"\n\nJoe DiMeglio, the chief of the San Diego Tunnel Task Force, told Whitaker that he wasn't sure Guzm\u00e1n would ever be caught again.\n\n2016: Recapturing \"El Chapo\"\n\nBut unlike the first time Guzm\u00e1n escaped from prison, he became sloppy the second time around. After his daring breakout in 2015, the drug lord seemed to become almost delusional.\n\n\"He became drunk on his own wine,\" said Peter Vincent, a senior official and legal adviser of both the Justice Department and Homeland Security during the international manhunt for Guzm\u00e1n. \"He started to believe the hype that he was special, that he was almost a demigod, that he was something truly magical. And he became so incredibly arrogant that he thought he was untouchable.\"\n\nHe wasn't. Only 20 days after his escape, the Mexican marines had picked up on Guzm\u00e1n's trail.\n\nIntelligence tracked him to a house in the coastal town of Los Mochis in northern Sinaloa. Wiretap intercepts picked up on a visit planned by \"grandma and aunt\"\u2014code names for Guzm\u00e1n and his lieutenant. Then, \"grandma\" finally showed up. As an assault force moved into position, an armored truck left to go pick up food for a party.\n\n\"For an incredibly savvy, clever, almost a criminal genius that El Chapo Guzm\u00e1n was, he ultimately was done in by very simple tastes: tacos, tequila, and chicas,\" Vincent said.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n was arrested again. Mexican federal police took him to a motel instead of jail \u2014 a move Vincent said indicates that Guzm\u00e1n had likely threatened his captors. But the Mexican marines appeared and apprehended Guzm\u00e1n for a last time, flying him to Mexico City for booking.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n was extradited to the United States in January last year to face murder and drug conspiracy charges. Opening arguments in his case begin Tuesday in New York City.", "WASHINGTON \u2014 At a ceremony celebrating the Hindu festival of lights Tuesday, President Trump had no comment on reports that he plans to remove Kirstjen Nielsen as secretary of homeland security.\n\nSources familiar with the matter tell CBS News Nielsen will be leaving, but say the timing is uncertain.

After months of research, the agency decided that a drug called Versed, a sedative often prescribed to reduce anxiety, was \"possibly worth a try.\" But in the end, the CIA decided not to ask government lawyers to approve its use.\n\nThe existence of the drug research program \u2014 dubbed \"Project Medication\" \u2014 is disclosed in a once-classified report that was provided to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) under a judge's order and was released by the organization Tuesday.\n\nThe 90-page CIA report, which was provided in advance to The Associated Press, is a window into the internal struggle that medical personnel working in the agency's detention and harsh interrogation program faced in reconciling their professional ethics with the chance to save lives by preventing future attacks.\n\n\"This document tells an essential part of the story of how it was that the CIA came to torture prisoners against the law and helps prevent it from happening again,\" said ACLU attorney Dror Ladin.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2007, CIA doctors, psychologists, physician assistants and nurses were directly involved in the interrogation program, the report said. They evaluated, monitored and cared for 97 detainees in 10 secret CIA facilities abroad and accompanied detainees on more than 100 flights.\n\nThe CIA ultimately decided against asking the Justice Department to approve drug-assisted interrogations, sparing CIA doctors \"some significant ethical concerns,\" the report said. It had taken months for the Justice Department to sign off on brutal interrogation tactics, including sleep deprivation, confinement in small spaces and the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding.\n\nThe CIA's counterterrorism team \"did not want to raise another issue with the Department of Justice,\" the report said.\n\nBefore settling on Versed, the report said researchers studied records of old Soviet drug experiments as well as the CIA's discredited MK-Ultra program from the 1950s and 1960s that involved human experimentation with LSD and other mind-altering drugs on unwitting individuals as part of a long search for some form of truth serum. These experiments were widely criticized and, even today, some experts doubt an effective substance exists.\n\n\"But decades later, the agency was considering experimenting on humans again to test pseudo-scientific theories of learned helplessness on its prisoners,\" Ladin said.\n\nVersed is a brand name for the sedative midazolam, used since the late 1970s and today sold commonly as a generic. It causes drowsiness and relieves anxiety and agitation. It also can temporarily impair memory, and often is used for minor surgery or medical procedures such as colonoscopies that require sedation but not full-blown anesthesia. It's in a class of anti-anxiety medications known as benzodiazepines that work by affecting a brain chemical that calms the activity of nerve cells.\n\n\"Versed was considered possibly worth a trial if unequivocal legal sanction first were obtained,\" the report said. \"There were at least two legal obstacles: a prohibition against medical experimentation on prisoners and a ban on interrogational use of 'mind-altering drugs' or those which 'profoundly altered the senses.'\"\n\nThose questions became moot after the CIA decided against asking the Justice Department to give it a green light. \"At the beginning of 2003, the Office of Medical Services' review, informally termed 'Project Medication' was shelved, never to be reactivated,\" the report said.\n\nThe CIA had no comment on the report's release, but government lawyers emphasized in a court filing in the case early last year that the report, expressly marked \"draft,\" was just one agency officer's impressions of the detention and interrogation program. The document is not the CIA's or the Office of Medical Service's \"final official history, or assessment, of the program,\" the lawyers wrote.\n\nThe ACLU spent more than two years in court trying to get the report released. In September 2017, a federal judge in New York ordered the CIA to release it. Government lawyers tried three more times to keep information contained in the report under wraps, but the ACLU received the bulk of the report in August. The government is still fighting to keep portions secret. They are to file briefs in a federal appeals court in New York on Wednesday, arguing that the judge ordered too much released.\n\nWhile the CIA's harsh interrogation program ended in 2007, the ACLU believes it's important to continue seeking the release of documents about it, especially since President Trump declared during his campaign that he would approve interrogating terror suspects with waterboarding, which is now banned by U.S. law, and a \"hell of a lot worse.\"\n\nCIA Director Gina Haspel, who was involved in supervising a secret CIA detention site in Thailand where detainees were waterboarded, told the Senate during her confirmation hearing that she does \"not support use of enhanced interrogation techniques for any purpose.\"\n\nThe report cites many instances where medical personal expressed concern or protected the health of the detainees. Those who were thrown up against walls \u2014 a practice called \"walling\" \u2014 had their necks protected from whiplash by rolled towels around their necks, the report said.\n\nWhen one detainee, who had been wounded during capture, was confined to a box, care was taken not to force his legs into a position that \"would compromise wound healing.\" Physician assistants overruled using duct tape over the mouths of detainees during flights because air sickness could lead to vomiting and possible aspiration.\n\n\"That doesn't mean that the doctors were sadistic or anything like that,\" Ladin said. \"But it means they were complicit because this pseudo-scientific torture could not have happened without the doctors' participation.\"\n\nAt the same time, the medical office's report said waterboarding was not \"intrinsically painful.\" It said there was \"physical discomfort from the occasional associated retching,\" but that two detainees who endured the most extensive waterboarding sessions complained only \"of the pain of the restraining straps.\"\n\nThat contrasts with the Senate's 2014 report on the CIA's interrogation program, which stated that a prisoner known as Abu Zubaydah, a suspected al Qaeda operative who was waterboarded more than 80 times, \"cried, begged, pleaded, vomited, and required medical resuscitation after being waterboarded.\"\n\nSome CIA medical personnel called waterboarding \"little more than an amateurish experiment\" and others worried that the practice would trigger spasms of the vocal cords, which could, at least temporarily, make it hard to speak or breathe.\n\nAt the same time, other medical personnel contended waterboarding actually \"provided periodic relief\" to a prisoner because it was a break from being forced to stand for long periods of time. The agency medical personnel also said the harsh interrogation program was \"reassuringly free of enduring physical or psychological effects.\"\n\nDr. Sondra Crosby, who has treated victims of torture, including two who were held at CIA secret sites, disagreed.\n\n\"The enduring pain and suffering experienced by the survivors of the CIA program is immense, and includes severe, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, physical ailments, and psychosocial dysfunction,\" said Crosby, of Boston University's School of Medicine and Public Health. \"At least one detainee was tortured to death. Their physical and psychological scars will last a lifetime.\"", "NEW YORK \u2014 There's a winner in Amazon's new headquarters sweepstakes. Two, actually.\n\nThe split decision Tuesday by the world's largest retailer follows a frenzied competition and billions of dollars in promised tax subsidies.\n\nAmazon's choice of New York City's Long Island City in the borough of Queens and the D.C. suburb of Arlington, Virginia, had been a poorly kept secret. With Tuesday's official announcement, the retail giant detailed what the two cities get: $5 billion in investments and 50,000 jobs earning an average of $150,000 a year.\n\n\"We need a lot of tech employees, software developers, computer scientists, engineers and both cities have available talent locally,\" Amazon senior vice president Jay Carney said.\n\nThe news ended a grand 14-month marketing campaign that inspired 238 cities to go to enormous lengths \u2014 some of it bordering on the absurd \u2014 to win the prize.\n\nThe mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, wrote 1,000 Amazon product reviews and posted a video of him doing it.\n\nBut Amazon may be the biggest winner, with more than $2 billion in tax giveaways and a massive amount of marketing data handed over by the 20 finalists. That gave the online retail giant a leg up on its marketing, shipping and logistics decisions.\n\nThe cities clearly believe Amazon will help them, but if Seattle's experience is any indicator, the relationship could be bumpy. Amazon has been blamed for Seattle's stagnant wages and lack of affordable housing. That has residents, like New York's Jonathan Westin, concerned.\n\n\"I think New York City is at a point where we don't need to recruit businesses to come here,\" said Westin, the executive director of New York Communities for Change. \"There's lots of businesses that are coming here without any subsidies without any tax breaks without anything.\"", "Despite New York City's tough reputation, it appears to have been out-negotiated by Virginia's Arlington County in the 238-city frenzy to snare Amazon's HQ2. That heated competition ended with the announcement Tuesday of two winners for the $5 billion development prize.\n\nEach location will get 25,000 jobs with six-figure salaries. Arlington promised $550 million in subsidies, while New York will shell out three times that amount. New York state is kicking in $1.5 billion in direct tax credits, $10 million in job-training costs and amenities such as the cost of building a corporate helipad for the Long Island City site.\n\n\"Incentives are highly contentious today, but we call them a necessary evil,\" said John Boyd, principal at the Boyd Co., a site-selection firm that advises companies and municipalities. He pointed out that Amazon passed up a nearly $8 billion subsidy package just across the river in Newark, New Jersey, in favor of Long Island City, in the New York City borough of Queens. \"I think the New York taxpayer got a great deal.\"\n\nJeff Bezos is not arriving on the 7 train pic.twitter.com/SPfBflDCRa \u2014 Henry Grabar (@henrygrabar) November 13, 2018\n\nWhether that deal pays off and becomes -- as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo claimed Tuesday, \"a big moneymaker\" for the city and state -- depends on a number of factors. Here are four areas to watch, according to economists and economic development experts.\n\nWho will get the jobs?\n\nNeither New York nor the Washington, D.C., area have trouble generating jobs for their more highly skilled residents, but both struggle with higher-than-average unemployment, higher-than-average poverty and limited social mobility. Amazon's Long island City site will abut the country's largest public housing development, Queensbridge Houses, where the average household income is just $15,000. Without a concerted effort, it's unlikely that many of these residents will be in line for an Amazon job paying $150,000.\n\n\"As we've seen in Seattle, the Bay Area, and in other cities where unfettered tech development has been allowed to spread, without good jobs specifically set aside for local residents and without strong protections for both tenants and middle-income homeowners, displacement is guaranteed,\" said the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development.\n\nAmazon's agreement with the city doesn't include a local job-hiring guarantee, it does contain $15 million -- $5 million of it from Amazon -- for job-training programs that prioritize lower-income workers or those without higher education. Nonprofit groups like Per Scholas, a Bronx-based job-training program, and Pursuit (formerly C4Q), a Queens technology training center, were involved in the pitch to woo Amazon. Now, they're banking on its presence to create enough demand to benefit some of its graduates.\n\n\"We hope to train Amazon's blue-collar warehouse workers to code and get rehired as software developers at the companies,\" Pursuit CEO Jukay Hsu said via a spokesman. Pursuit will operate a job-training center at the site, the organization said.\n\n\"We understand the needs of our community and the barriers they face in accessing these growing opportunities in the tech industry,\" said Hsu. \"We look forward to working with the company, New York City and New York state to ensure that these promises are meaningfully delivered.\"\n\nNPower, another tech-training nonprofit, launched a new program in partnership with Amazon Web Services this summer to train students in cloud computing. It prepares high school grads who have basic technical training for jobs as system administrators or cloud-computing specialists, said NPower Executive Director Helen Kogan. \"For us, it's an opportunity to bring in fresh tech talent, who may not have had that opportunity but are talented and ready to go,\" she said, adding that NPower plans to increase its size by 50 percent next year.\n\nWhere will they live?\n\nResearch suggests that when a major new employer moves to an area, only one-fifth of the created jobs go to unemployed locals; the rest attracts transplants from elsewhere. That means tens of thousands of new residents in areas where housing supply is already tight. \"No question, there will be pressure on these neighborhoods,\" Eric Gertler, who sits on the board of New York's chief economic development agency, told CBSN.\n\nWithout significant investment in new affordable housing, low-income tenants could be pushed out as landlords woo the higher-income newcomers. Existing homeowners, if they choose, could sell at a neat profit.\n\nLong Island City has built more housing in recent years than any other New York neighborhood, a 2017 study found. Luckily for workers pulling in six figures, and unluckily for everyone else, most of that is luxury development aimed at high-income tenants.\n\nHow will they get to work?\n\nAmazon's agreements call for the winning localities to put significant funds into infrastructure. That's one investment that could create significant returns, according to development experts.\n\n\"That's an under-the-radar aspect of how these deals are done today,\" said Boyd. \"The idea is that, above and beyond tax credits and tax exemptions, investing in things like bridges, connecting to Reagan Airport [near Arlington], improving roads -- that serves the public good, and it helps to create entrepreneurship as well.\"\n\nVirginia will spend $295 million on improvements to the Metro stations at Crystal City and Potomac Yards, an improved connection to Ronald Reagan National Airport and other projects. In addition, $28 million in future property taxes will be earmarked for improvements to the Amazon site.\n\nNew York's promised infrastructure upgrades aren't tied to Amazon, but in a city where more than half of workers take public transit, they're key to the project's success. Already-planned improvements coming to nearby LaGuardia and JFK International airports also will help ease the retail and shipping giant's activities.\n\nOther cities are watching -- or should be\n\n\n\nOpponents of corporate subsidies said Amazon's choices prove taxpayer incentives matter much less than advertised. \"[A]ccess to an educated workforce and high-quality public amenities are what drive business location decisions -- not the presence of low or regressive taxes,\" the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy said in a statement. \"These cross-state bidding wars are a waste of scarce public dollars that do nothing to move our nation forward.\"\n\nMany New York politicians share this skepticism, despite their governor's claim Tuesday that the deal ultimately \"costs us nothing, nada, niente -- we make money doing this.\"\n\nAnd they're not the only ones likely to keep a careful eye on Amazon's promised rewards. Legislators in cities and states that Amazon passed over will be monitoring how the project unrolls. If they realize that a secret 14-month corporate search process didn't net all that much for the winners, the next time around, they may decide to sit it out.", "bad url", "bad url", "Hate crime incidents targeting Jews and Jewish institutions in the U.S. spiked about 37 percent between 2016 and 2017, according to data released Tuesday by the FBI. The rise is based on data that reflects an increased number of law enforcement agencies reporting to the federal government -- numbers that show an overall 17 percent increase in hate crimes.\n\nIt was the third year in a row hate offenses rose in the U.S. There were 7,175 hate crime incidents reported in 2017, and a total of 8,437 offenses (some incidents included multiple charges). Hate crimes based on race, ethnicity or ancestry were the most common, making up about 60 percent of the total.\n\nReligious-based hate crime comprised about 20 percent of the total. The FBI data shows Jewish people and institutions were most frequently targeted, accounting for 58.1 percent of religious-based hate crime incidents. Muslims were the second most frequent target, at 18.6 percent.\n\nThere were 938 anti-Jewish hate crime incidents encompassing 976 offenses in 2017, compared with 684 incidents encompassing 834 offenses in 2016, according to the FBI.\n\nThe data from the past decade shows a decline in anti-Jewish hate crime through 2015, when 51.3 percent of religious hate crime offenses targeted Jews or Jewish institutions. The figures rose to 54.2 percent in 2016 and 58.1 percent in 2017.\n\nIn a statement, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said he was \"particularly troubled by the increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes.\"\n\n\"The American people can be assured that this department has already taken significant and aggressive actions against these crimes and that we will vigorously and effectively defend their rights,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League said the new data marking an increase in hate crimes is particularly concerning because it comes just weeks after a gunman fatally shot 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. The group said the FBI's data mirrors its own audit showing a surge in anti-Semitic incidents in major cities across the country.\n\nAnti-Semitic crime spiked in New York City, home to the largest Jewish population outside Israel, in the weeks leading up to the Pittsburgh massacre, CBS News reported last week. There were 31 anti-Semitic hate crimes reported in the first 28 days of October in the city, compared to 9 for the same period in 2017, a New York Police Department spokesman said. The Anti-Defamation League also released a report that found social media harassment targeting Jewish Americans increased around the 2018 midterm elections and two-thirds of those online attacks were from people, not bots.\n\n\"This report provides further evidence that more must be done to address the divisive climate of hate in America,\" ADL CEO and National Director Jonathan A. Greenblatt said in a statement. \"That begins with leaders from all walks of life and from all sectors of society forcefully condemning anti-Semitism, bigotry, and hate whenever it occurs.\"\n\nThe FBI's latest report also found 15.8 percent of hate crime offenses in 2017 stemmed from sexual orientation bias. Bias over disability comprised 1.9 percent of cases, gender identity hatred comprised 1.6 percent, and gender bias made up .6 percent.\n\nOverall, hate crime incidents that stemmed from religious hatred rose about 23 percent between 2106 and 2017, while hate crimes motivated by racial bias rose about 18 percent and attacks on LGBT individuals rose 5 percent. Of race or ethnicity-based hate crime incidents both years, about half targeted African-Americans.\n\n\"I think our polarized environment ... we see people bringing a kind of toxicity into the political conversations that we've never seen before,\" Greenblatt told CBS News' Meg Oliver.\n\nMost of the hate crime offenses \u2014 about 5,000 \u2014 were categorized as crimes against persons such as intimidation or assault, while about 3,000 were considered crimes against property such as vandalism, robbery or burglary.

The data is based on voluntary reporting by police agencies.\n\nLast month, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said the Justice Department's new hate crime initiative was \"taking on the challenging task of addressing the gap in hate crime statistics\" and officials were reviewing the \"accuracy of those reports,\" the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe FBI says it will launch training for law enforcement officers on how to identify hate crimes and report the data to the federal government.

Ben Ray Lujan, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Participation by African-Americans jumped 157 percent.\n\n\"Latino voters played a pivotal role in taking back the House,\" Lujan told reporters during a conference call organized by the political action committee Latino Victory. \"Evidence is clear: Early and active and robust outreach to communities of color \u2014 in this case, into the Hispanic community \u2014 clearly pays off.\"\n\nLujan, the first Hispanic to head the committee, said the effort included an investment of at least $21 million in Latino candidates. His office also launched the first multi-state Spanish-language TV ad the final week before the election. Lujan is currently vying for the post of Assistant Democratic Leader when Democrats gain the majority in the House next year.\n\nThe Democrats targeted 111 Republican House congressional districts, 29 of which had at least a 10 percent Hispanic electorate.\n\nDan Sena, the DCCC executive director, said the polling company Latino Decisions conducted nationwide focus groups to better identify the needs of Latino voters and tailor a message.\n\n\"What we wanted was a real, organic way to engage Latino voters and Hispanic voters across the country with a message that was positive,\" Sena said. \"We did a fair amount of studying how to create urgency without it feeling overtly heavy.\"\n\nDuring the campaign, President Donald Trump kept up a daily drumbeat of warnings about a caravan of \"bad thugs\" and potential terrorists intent on invading the U.S. from Mexico. He suggested sending up to 15,000 troops to the border.\n\nLujan highlighted the victory of Antonio Delgado in New York as an example of how a Latino candidate won by keeping a positive message even when facing racist attacks.\n\nDelgado, a Harvard Law School graduate and Rhodes scholar, defeated Republican Rep. John Faso for a congressional seat representing the Hudson Valley. Republicans seized on his brief hip-hop career to portray Delgado, who is black, as unfit for office. Campaign ads by the National Republican Campaign Committee highlighted Delgado's stint as a rapper and portrayed him as a menacing figure.\n\n\"Antonio did not get distracted by any of that. What he did was he talked to the American people and the people of the 19th District of New York about the economic challenges that they are facing every day,\" Lujan said.\n\nThe Hispanic community will have a record level of representation on Capitol Hill with at least 42 members: 34 Democrats and eight Republicans in both chambers.

Minors accounted for 17 percent of all hate crimes in which the perpetrator was identifiable.\n\nAnti-Semitic acts, both crimes and non-criminal behavior, nearly doubled at U.S. elementary and secondary schools in 2017, according to the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group.\n\nExperts say the jump is more than just a case of \"boys will be boys,\" but a reflection of the community around them.\n\n\"People view these as childish pranks, but they're more than that,\" said Jack McDevitt, the director of Northeastern's Institute on Race and Justice. \"They send messages to communities that say, 'We don't want you.'\"\n\nHate crimes are typically the stuff of men in their twenties and younger, said McDevitt, noting that younger people often mimic the attitudes of adults around them. In other words, when hate crimes rise nationally, offenses by minors rises even faster.\n\n\"They react to what they see in their community,\" McDevitt said. \"When they see messages from society that says, 'It's okay,\" then it empowers young people who don't have a lot of perspective yet.\"\n\nMcDevitt recalled an instance when a 14-year old boy threw a Molotov cocktail into the home of a black family that had recently moved into a historically white neighborhood. When police asked what prompted the behavior, the boy said he'd overheard his parents say they'd potentially leave the community if other black families moved in.\n\n\"The parents were appalled by their son's interpretation, but it just shows that the language we use to portray other groups is important,\" McDevitt said.\n\nHate crimes in the U.S. increased 17 percent in 2017, the third straight annual increase, according to the FBI. The ADL recorded 457 anti-Jewish incidents in elementary and secondary schools, a 94 percent increase from 235 in the year prior. Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive officer of the ADL, called the continued increases \"deeply troubling.\"\n\n\"While we can't say there is one reason why this happening everywhere, we do know that what happens in schools is a reflection of what is happening in society,\" wrote Greenblatt in an email to CBS News on Tuesday. \"When anti-Semitic rhetoric or dog whistling is allowed in our public square and proliferates on social media without condemnation, especially from our leaders, it gives encouragement to impressionable young people.\"\n\nMany researchers, including McDevitt, think there's even more hate crime in the U.S. than reported. The FBI only shares instances that local law enforcement has categorized as a hate crime, and definitions vary by jurisdiction. McDevitt worked with the FBI in 1990 traveling the country to train local police departments on how to identify hate crimes.\n\nMcDevitt recalled in the early 2000s reviewing a crime where townspeople had placed small, burning crosses on the front yard of a black family. The crime wasn't categorized as a hate crime because local police required that a cross be six feet tall and wrapped in rags in order to qualify.\n\n\"We've moved in a positive direction, but there's still a lot of work to go,\" McDevitt said.", "", "GENEVA \u2014 Christie's sold the \"Pink Legacy\" diamond at auction Tuesday for more than $50 million including fees, saying it's a new world record price per carat for a pink diamond.\n\nChristie's said that renowned jeweler Harry Winston was the buyer. The auction house had expected to fetch $30 million to $50 million for the nearly 19-carat, rectangular-cut stone, the largest fancy vivid pink diamond that it has ever put under the hammer.\n\nIt was the standout offering at Christie's fall jewelry auction in Geneva. The standing-room only ballroom broke into applause after the auctioneer struck down a hammer price of $44.5 million. That excludes the standard \"buyer's premium\" and other fees.\n\nThe stone once belonged to the Oppenheimer diamond family, and Christie's says it's among the most chemically pure gems.\n\nRahul Kadakia, Christie's head of international jewelry, said that auction house has only sold four diamonds weighing more than 10 carats of the same color in its 251 years of history.\n\nChristie's sale kicks off two days of jewelry auctions in Geneva. On Wednesday, Sotheby's will auction jewelry once owned by French Queen Marie Antoinette that hadn't been seen in public for 200 years.\n\nThey include a monogrammed diamond ring along with a lock of her hair, earrings and a rare drop pearl with a starting price of $1 million.\n\nThe pieces were smuggled out of France before her failed attempt to escape the French Revolution, which began in 1789.\n\n\"I think she probably was one of the original, you know, the original 'it girl'.

Mark Sanford wrote a piece for the New York Times titled \"A Wake-Up Call for the GOP.\" Sanford, a frequent critic of President Trump, was defeated in his primary by hard-right candidate Katie Arrington in June. Arrington, in turn, was defeated on Election Day by Joe Cunningham, the first Democrat to be elected to that seat in over four decades.\n\nSanford argued that the GOP's embrace of Mr. Trump's style and his policies on certain issues led to Republican defeat in the House. He pointed specifically to modern Republican opinions on environmental conservation, fiscal responsibility and civility. Arrington had knocked Sanford on his opposition to off-shore drilling, which Cunningham used as a wedge issue in the election.\n\n\"The Republican Party that so many of us care deeply about continues to be held hostage these days, and what I saw last week in a district I grew up in and know well is that there is a half-life to insults, bullying and an embrace of a post-truth world,\" Sanford wrote. \"In this district, my former opponent adopted Mr. Trump's highly combative style. It worked in the primary, but it fell flat in the general election.\"\n\nSanford concluded that the Republican Party would be \"wise to take a step back from President Trump's approach to politics,\" adding that \"adhering to the simple approaches of kindness and respect, principles that have long guided society, could these days be groundbreaking.\"\n\nRep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, currently a freshman legislator, is the only one of the three who successfully defended his seat on Election Day. But he's disheartened by the problems in the House that he's now seen up close. He wrote in the Atlantic that Congress is stuck in a partisan quagmire which is \"worse than you think.\" His focus was not on what Republicans did wrong in losing control of the House, elections, but rather, how both parties could improve the House of Representatives.\n\n\"The problem is a defective process and a power structure that, whichever party is in charge, funnels all power to leadership and stifles debate and initiative within the ranks,\" Gallagher wrote. He added that offering suggestions for structural reform wasn't likely to win him friends among his colleagues. \"No one wants to have me on Fox News or MSNBC to discuss the finer points of appropriations versus authorization committees (caravans and Kavanaugh make for better theater),\" Gallagher said. Many Republicans focused on illegal immigration in the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nGallagher suggested changing the congressional calendar so that legislators are not constantly traveling back and forth between their districts and Washington, and carving out three weeks per month for representatives to stay in D.C. and legislate. He also thinks committee members should be able to elect their chairs, as opposed to letting party leadership decide. And he recommended limiting the number of committees.\n\nHe acknowledged that he did not have suggestions for his counterparts in the Senate, \"where the fundamental problem seems to be that every member wants to be president.\" However, he noted that some members of the House were passionate about reform, notably the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus.\n\n\"The worst thing we can do is to ignore the American people and do nothing to regain their trust. Until we fix the processes and the structures of power within Congress, we should expect more of the same\u2014polarization, vitriol, and demagoguery,\" he wrote.\n\nOn Veterans Day, Rep. Jason Lewis of Minnesota penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in which he blamed the late Sen. John McCain for the party's loss of House control to Democrats. Lewis, who was defeated by Democrat Angie Craig, argued that when McCain voted against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, Democrats took the opportunity to target House Republicans falsely, he says, for taking away coverage of pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"The Republican Party lost its House majority on July 28, 2017, when Sen. John McCain ended the party's seven-year quest to repeal ObamaCare,\" Lewis wrote.\n\nLewis's piece was a full-throated defense of the American Health Care Act, the Republican bill to repeal and replace the ACA that passed the House but was torpedoed in the Senate. He argued that in the future, anti-Trump Republicans should not vote against the president's policy positions.\n\n\"The late Arizona senator's grievance with all things Trump was well known, but this obsession on the part of \"Never Trump\" Republicans has to end. Disapprove of the president's style if you like, but don't sacrifice sound policy to pettiness,\" Lewis wrote.\n\nMcCain died of brain cancer in August, and his daughter Meghan called the piece by Lewis \"abhorrent\" on Twitter. Some also considered the Veterans Day op-ed disrespectful because McCain was a veteran and former prisoner of war.", "Hip-hop's hottest acts are joining the new Netflix show \"Rhythm + Flow.\" Cardi B, Chance the Rapper and T.I. will judge the hip-hop competition series, a 10-part talent search across the country.\n\n\"Rhythm + Flow,\" set for release in 2019, will be Netflix's first music competition show.

He resigned three hours after the story was published.\n\nLast week, a prosecutor announced Schneiderman won't face criminal charges for his misconduct. The Nassau County district attorney said in a statement she believes the accusers, but could not pursue criminal charges because of \"legal impediments.\" Schneiderman said in a statement, \"I accept full responsibility for my conduct in my relationships with my accusers, and for the impact it had on them.\"\n\nIn her first TV interview since coming forward, Barish told \"CBS This Morning\" that despite his public apology, Schneiderman has not personally apologized to her for his behavior.\n\nBarish explained she initially spoke out to support the stories of other women who were coming forward, but said doing so was difficult. She struggled with the implications of coming forward and how it would affect her life. Ultimately, she was moved by what happened to other women.\n\n\"When [Jane Mayer of the New Yorker] told me there were two other women who were about to go on record and they had been hurt, and one of them had sustained hearing loss, my knees just sort of buckled.

In October, the company announced it was buying the cloud software provider Red Hat for $34 billion in its biggest tech deal ever. IBM is also investing $1 billion in initiatives like apprenticeships to train workers for what it calls \"new collar\" jobs \u2013 a phrase coined by IBM president and CEO Ginni Rometty for workers who have technology skills but not a four-year college degree.\n\n\"I think it really gets at one of the biggest issues of our time because these new technologies are great, they're going to solve many problems\u2026 but they also create a big digital divide \u2013 almost a have and have not,\" Rometty said Tuesday on \"CBS This Morning.\"\n\n\"People often talk about jobs being removed by [artificial intelligence].

The company is also shutting down some of its social media accounts, which are popular with young people.\n\nIn a statement, Juul CEO Kevin Burns said the company and the FDA \"share a common goal \u2013 preventing youth from initiating on nicotine.\"\n\n\"We don't want anyone who doesn't smoke, or already use nicotine, to use Juul products. We certainly don't want youth using the product,\" he said. \"It is bad for public health, and it is bad for our mission.\"\n\nIn September, the FDA set a 60-day deadline for several major e-cigarette companies to prove they could keep their products away from kids. Juul holds more than 70 percent of the e-cigarette market share overall and is known for its popularity among minors. The device resembles a flash drive and can be plugged into a computer to recharge.\n\nFlavored nicotine products are especially concerning, experts say, because their taste appeals to young people, thus making it more likely they will start using the products and get hooked.\n\nJuul said the four flavors will still be available for sale online at the company's website, but it will impose additional age-verification measures and third-party verification to block sales to anyone under the age of 21.\n\nRegular tobacco, menthol and mint flavored pods will continue to be available at retail stores.\n\nMothers like Meredith Berkman, with Parents Against Vaping E-Cigarettes, told CBS News' Anna Werner there should be a ban.\n\n\"We just want them to ban the flavors, because the evidence shows that flavors hook kids,\" Berkman said.\n\nThe company will also eliminate its U.S.-based social media accounts on Facebook and Instagram. It says it will limit its presence on Twitter to non-promotional communications and utilize YouTube for posting testimonials of former adult smokers who have switched to Juul. The company says it has never used Snapchat.\n\nLast month, researchers from the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California raised concerns about adolescents being exposed to Juul through social media. Their study found that underage kids make up 25 percent of Juul's followers on Twitter.\n\n\"Juul's posts go out to its followers, those users then retweet into their own accounts, and the message gets propagated within the social network, ultimately reaching a lot of adolescents accounts in a small time period,\" study author Dr. Jon-Patrick Allem told CBS News in October.\n\nJuul said it has already imposed 21+ \"age-gating\" restrictions for users to access its Twitter and YouTube content. The company said it will continue to monitor and remove inappropriate material from third-party social media accounts.\n\nThe FDA is expected to announce a proposal this week to ban the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes at retail stores and gas stations across the country.

Jordan looks through the window in a Manhattan hotel and says, \"I think everybody's real sad right now.\" The \"Black Panther\" star is talking about the passing of Marvel legend Stan Lee, who died on Monday, and the legacy he leaves behind.\n\n\"The sky's crying a little bit for Stan,\" he said. \"It's been all the things he's contributed to. Marvel changed the face of entertainment in a lot of ways. To be part of 'Black Panther,' one of the last movies he got to see come together, I felt really honored to be part of that.\"\n\nThe success of \"Black Panther\" would not have been possible without Lee, who co-created the comic book character. It's also unlikely the film would have been the smash hit it was without director Ryan Coogler, either.\n\nJordan and Coogler have been working together since \"Fruitvale Station,\" the acclaimed 2013 indie movie about Oscar Grant III, an unarmed black man who was killed by a white police officer in Oakland. Jordan said that Coogler showed him a person of color could succeed behind the camera in Hollywood.\n\n\"He was my representation,\" Jordan said. \"Being able to work with Ryan from a small independent film all the way to the biggest budget, to a Marvel film, he kind of showed me what was possible.\"\n\nIn September, Jordan and WarnerMedia announced that they were launching a company-wide inclusion rider with the film \"Just Mercy.\" Jordan stars in and executive produces the upcoming movie.\n\n\"Being a person of color, you always try to reverse-engineer or find ways to make things easier to give more opportunities for yourself and other people who look like you,\" he said. \"To be part of 'Black Panther' was just a monumental move, to shift the needle, to get people to look at things a little differently, to bust through these glass ceilings that were in place or the way people used to think about projects like that and also being able to work with the inclusion rider to be able to push that narrative forward.\"\n\n\"Just Mercy\" is set for release in 2020, but right now, Jordan is busy promoting \"Creed II,\" the sequel to the 2015 hit. He admitted that it was strange not to have Coogler direct.\n\n\"It was a little weird at first, but he was finishing 'Black Panther' at the time and he couldn't do both,\" he explained. \"It was a really big deal; it was a lot of work for him on 'Black Panther,' and he was still able to produce [\"Creed II\"] but put it on Steven Caple, who is an amazing young director from Cleveland, Ohio.\"\n\nJordan said working with Caple was similar to working with Coogler in his early career.\n\n\"Ryan came out of Sundance, did a small independent film and then he did 'Creed'; Steven Caple did a small independent film and then did 'Creed' so they had a similar trajectory and path, so [the movie] was perfectly spot-on.\"\n\nThe actor is excited for fans to see a more grown-up Adonis Creed, and the evolution of the relationships from the first film, \"especially between Adonis and Bianca, Adonis and Rocky.\"\n\nHe continued, \"He's becoming a father now. He's creating his own family and I think that's something he's been longing for for a really long time and the revenge element of it all \u2014 the fact that Drago is back in town, it makes you feel a little bit like 'Rocky IV' \u2014 that closure of 'Rocky IV,' you know \u2014 so you get that grudge match feeling. It's action-packed.\"\n\nJordan said being on set with Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren made him want to prove himself and get physical.\n\n\"I'm competitive,\" he admitted. \"You get me and Florian [Munteanu] \u2014 we both are very competitive. When you've got Sly and Dolph sitting over there and they're talking about the good ol' days, when they used to get in there and slug it out and get hit. They went through it and we kind of wanted to go through it, too.\" Jordan said he was careful not to go overboard, but let his hands and knees take a lot of \"wear and tear\" while filming.\n\n\"Creed II\" drops on November 21, Thanksgiving Eve, but Jordan is also making time during the holiday season to give back. He is teaming up with Honey Nut Cheerios' Good Rewards program to help raise money for Feeding America, a charity that hits close to home.\n\n\"I've always been around food,\" he explained. \"My dad worked for a food bank; he used to manage one in Newark, New Jersey. I always saw the need to help people; my mom's a social worker. And they're all very good cooks, so food has always been a very big staple in my life.\"\n\nIn fact, Jordan said his family had a home catering business, and he grew up cooking. He said he's still trying to figure out what to make for his Thanksgiving brunch this year.", "", "A total of 90 people in 27 states have come down with the rare, polio-like neurological condition acute flaccid myelitis, also known as AFM, so far this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Tuesday. That's up from 72 cases reported last week. The CDC is investigating an additional 162 cases for potential AFM.\n\nAlmost all of the patients are children under the age of 18. Officials still do not know what causes the illness and what is behind the recent spike in cases.\n\nAFM is an illness that affects the nervous system, specifically the area of spinal cord called gray matter. It causes the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak or even paralyzed. Cases of AFM are characterized by a sudden onset of arm or leg weakness and loss of muscle tone and reflexes. In extreme cases, patients may need a ventilator to breathe.\n\nIts symptoms are likened to those caused by polio, which was eradicated in the U.S. thanks to the polio vaccine. However, the CDC has stressed that none of the children who developed these symptoms had the polio virus.\n\nHealth officials saw the first wave of AFM cases in 2014, when 120 cases were confirmed in the United States. Another 149 were reported in 2016. Case counts were far lower in 2015 and 2017, and experts don't know why it seems to follow an every-other-year pattern. In years where more cases have been reported, peaks are seen in the late summer and fall.\n\nThe CDC knows of one death in a child who had AFM in 2017. No deaths from the illness have been reported in 2018.\n\nQuestions also remain over what causes the illness itself. In 2014, the first wave of the mystery disease coincided with an outbreak of a specific type of virus, an enterovirus called EV-D68, leading the CDC to study a possible connection between the two.\n\nHowever, this year officials have tested for EV-D68 in about three-quarters of the confirmed AFM cases and detected it in the spinal fluid of just one patient. Another type of enterovirus called EV-A71 was found in another patient.\n\nDr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, told reporters during a press briefing Tuesday that the CDC has created a task force of specialists to better understand AFM. She said the CDC is \"broadening our hypotheses\" for what may cause AFM.\n\nFor example, if the illness is caused by a virus, Messonnier said, it is possible that the currently available tests are unable to pick it up, or perhaps the germ has already cleared the spinal fluid by the time the testing was conducted, or that it is hidden elsewhere in the body.\n\nAnother theory is that there's something in certain individuals that predisposes their immune system to react so severely that it triggers paralysis.\n\nAll things considered, AFM is extremely rare, with the CDC estimating that less than one in a million people in the United States will get AFM every year.\n\n\"As a mom myself I can certainly understand why parents are worried,\" Messonnier said. \"But it's important for parents to realize it still is a relatively rare condition.\"\n\nShe says parents who are concerned about AFM or think their child has symptoms of the illness should speak to their pediatrician.", "", "As wildfires burn relentlessly in both Northern and Southern California, disaster modeler CoreLogic predicts that 48,390 homes in the state could be at \"high or extreme risk\" of damage. That would bring potential reconstruction costs to $18 billion.\n\nAlthough those property damages are huge, they're only part of the cost of California's now year-round fire season, which seems to grow worse each passing year. The death toll is now 44 and climbing from two concurrently burning fires: Northern California's Camp Fire and Southern California's Woolsey Fire. An estimated 200 people remain unaccounted for and are possibly lost.\n\nThe Camp Fire, which decimated the town of Paradise, has burned roughly 117,000 acres and is only about 30 percent contained. An estimated 435 structures have been destroyed in the Woolsey Fire west of Los Angeles, where another 57,000 buildings are believed to be threatened. This fire, which is also only 30 percent contained, has burned more than 90,000 acres in upscale communities near and on the California coast.\n\nIt's impossible to tally the total cost of 2018's fire ravages, which actually began in December 2017 with the infamous Thomas Fire that lasted until June of this year. It was the largest fire in state history at the time. But it's clear that 2018 will be worse than last year.\n\nTotal costs then were estimated at $180 billion, or more than twice as much as the worst U.S. hurricane -- Katrina in 2005 -- which devastated New Orleans and cost $81 billion in property losses. The 2017 California fire figure included insurance losses, state and federal fire suppression, recovery expenditures, mudslides and the loss of wineries throughout Napa and Sonoma counties.\n\nThis year's California wildfires are likely to burn into December before they're totally contained. The Woolsey Fire has forced wealthy sections like Malibu and Thousand Oaks to evacuate. Approximately 300,000 people have been forced from their homes statewide.\n\n\"Due to the unpredictable nature of wildfires and the presently evolving disaster,\" CoreLogic, which analyzes the damage down to individual ZIP codes, said it couldn't predict how many homes would actually burn, adding that not all structures would sustain damage. However, more than 6,700 homes and businesses have already been lost.\n\nImpact on real estate\n\n\n\nIn addition, smoke and ash are likely to spread in a large swath across the state, affecting homes, heating, water supply and ventilation, while creating respiratory problems even where no fire occurred. At last night's National Football League game in San Francisco between the 49ers and the New York Giants, players used oxygen.\n\nCalifornia is the country's largest real estate market. Experts have said each fire compounds the cost of recovery and reconstruction. That makes it harder to find another home, driving up housing prices and causing materials and construction costs to soar. That could cause the cost of the average California home -- now valued at $440,000 -- to spiral upward. Typical rents in the state are already 50 percent more than the national average.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has approved a disaster declaration for the state, the 11th this year. It allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide financial and physical assistance to areas devastated by fire, winds, flood and other natural disasters.", "When Barack Obama made history as the nation's first African-American president, his mother-in-law admits she was worried about their safety.\n\n\"I felt like this was going to be a very hard life for both of them,\" said Marian Shields Robinson, who moved with the first family to Washington when Mr. Obama took office.\n\nShe and her daughter Michelle Obama sat down with \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King to discuss life in the White House.

It said the closures were needed \"to install and pre-position port hardening infrastructure equipment in preparation for the migrant caravan and the potential safety and security risk that it could cause.\"\n\nOn Thursday, 1,100 Marines from Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in California were deployed to support border security, CBS San Diego affiliate KFMB reported. They were primarily tasked with installing concertina wire and pre-positioning jersey barriers, barricades and fencing.\n\n\"CBP has been and will continue to prepare for the potential arrival of thousands of people migrating in a caravan heading towards the border of the United States,\" Pete Flores, director of San Diego field operations for CBP, said in a statement.\n\nThe caravans became a campaign issue in U.S. midterm elections and President Trump has ordered the deployment of over 5,000 military troops to the border to help fend off the migrants. Mr. Trump has insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nTo the thousands of Central American migrants making their way toward Mexico's Pacific coast state of Nayarit, the prospect of meeting a hostile reception at the border is nothing new. After a month on the road, through three countries, migrants like Maribel, 22, from La Ceiba, Honduras, are used to tough conditions.\n\nMaribel, who did not want her last name used for fear of reprisals in Honduras, pushed a baby carriage with her 1-year-old daughter while her husband pushed another with their 3-year-old son along a highway leading from Guadalajara to the Nayarit capital of Tepic.\n\n\"We are well aware of everything Trump has been saying,\" said Maribel. \"Let them close whatever they want to close, but we are going to get through anyway.\"\n\nThe thousands of Central American migrants left shelters in Guadalajara early Tuesday and were taken by bus to a highway tollbooth to wait for rides to their next destination. Most appeared intent on taking the Pacific coast route northward to the border city of Tijuana, which was still about 1,350 miles away. The migrants have come about 1,500 miles since they started out in Honduras around October 13. While the caravan previously averaged only about 30 miles a day, the migrants are now covering daily distances of 185 miles or more, partly because they are relying on hitchhiking rather than walking.\n\nA smaller, second caravan began arriving in Mexico City on Monday. A third caravan was heading toward the capital.\n\nMany say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.", "", "", "", "", "If the ouster of Attorney General Jeff Sessions wasn't enough to elicit concern from Trump critics in Washington, replacing him with Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker certainly has.\n\nWhile President Trump searches for a permanent appointment for attorney general \u2014 something Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham says will likely happen \"early next year\" \u2014 Whitaker oversees special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling and any ties to Trump associates.\n\nDemocrats are already urging Whitaker to recuse himself from the investigation, given Whitaker's public remarks on television and in print criticizing the scope and authority of Mueller's investigation. But Mr. Trump never forgave Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation, and publicly and repeatedly berated his attorney general for doing so. Whitaker has given no indication that he intends to recuse himself after assuming the oversight baton from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\n\"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's office has been involved in the daily oversight of Mueller's investigation from the outset, and it would be difficult both legally and as a political matter to completely cut his office out of that role going forward,\" said Robert Mintz, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at the McCarter & English law firm. \"But there are no defined rules within the DOJ that directly address these issues, and how this shift in leadership within the Department will impact the Mueller probe is difficult to predict.\"\n\nSo, what authority may Whitaker flex in the Mueller probe, and how?\n\nCould he fire Mueller?\n\nIn short, \"Yes. But he needs to find good cause to do so,\" said Rebecca Lonergan, a former assistant U.S. Attorney who now teaches at the University of Southern California's Gould School of Law.\n\nFederal regulations governing a special counsel say that counsel may be \"disciplined or removed from office only by the personal action of the attorney general.\"\n\n\"The attorney general may remove a special counsel for misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including violation of departmental policies,\" the code continues. \"The attorney general shall inform the special counsel in writing of the specific reason for his or her removal.\"\n\nMr. Trump has said he doesn't want to fire Mueller, for political reasons.\n\n\"I could fire everybody right now,\" Mr. Trump said in a post-midterms presser last week, the longest-running press conference of his presidency. \"But I don't want to stop it because politically, I don't like stopping it.\"\n\nLonergan doesn't think Whitaker will fire Mueller \u2014 but he could thwart the investigation in other ways.\n\nCould Whitaker cut Mueller's budget?\n\nWhitaker certainly seems to think he could cut slash Mueller's budget. In July 2017, he told CNN's Don Lemon he could envision a scenario in which the \"attorney general doesn't fire Bob Mueller but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigations grind to almost a halt.\"\n\nLonergan said slashing Mueller's budget is a more realistic possibility than firing him. Mueller's budget and the resources available to him \u2014 like additional personnel needed from DOJ \u2014 are up to Whitaker now.\n\n\"So if you take away the resources you really, really can make the investigation impossible to complete,\" Lonergan said.\n\nWhether Whitaker would considerably attempt to scale back Mueller's probe remains to be seen, said Michael Mukasey, former attorney general under George W. Bush.\n\n\"If he's the attorney general then he can control the scope of the investigation and can, on a year to year basis, control the budget that's in the regulation,\" Mukasey, who has suggested the end of Mueller's investigation is overdue, told CBS News in a phone interview. \"Whether he would do that with all the yelling and screaming that would go on is a whole different thing.\"\n\nWhitaker might not be able to hack away at Mueller's budget until next year, however, as the special counsel is funded through the end of the current fiscal year ending after September 2019.\n\nCould he control the scope of Mueller's investigation?\n\nWhitaker has certainly been critical of the scope of Mueller's investigation, writing an entire op-ed for CNN on that topic last year.\n\nIn an August 2017 opinion piece with the title, \"Mueller's investigation is going too far,\" Whitaker made the case that probing the president's finances would cross an invisible line.\n\n\"It does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump's finances or his family's finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else. That goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel,\" Whitaker wrote at the time.\n\nThat op-ed, written before Whitaker joined the Justice Department as Sessions' chief of staff, is one of the main reasons Democrats are citing to justify why they believe he should recuse himself, or even resign.\n\nLonergan said that Whitaker might find it difficult to scale back the scope of Mueller's investigation. But if Mueller's team wants to review something it believes falls under its broad original jurisdiction and Whitaker disagrees that such a subject of investigation falls within that scope, Whitaker could likely keep Mueller from examining that area.\n\nHe could set parameters around any entirely new areas the special counsel wants to probe that don't fall within the original jurisdiction, Lonergan said.\n\n\"The AG has a lot of power over where the investigation goes,\" Lonergan said.\n\nIn a nutshell, Whitaker's latitude is broad.\n\n\"As the acting attorney general, Matt Whitaker now has the full authority within the Department of Justice to oversee the Mueller investigation,\" Mintz said. \"That means that technically he has the discretion to manage the investigation, control Mueller's budget and direct the scope of the special counsel's team of prosecutors, or fire Mueller altogether.\"\n\nWhat's the deal with recusal?\n\nDemocrats are urging Whitaker to recuse himself from the Mueller probe due to his past critical comments. But Whitaker hasn't made any indication he will do so, and it seems less likely he would do so after Mr. Trump repeatedly blasted Sessions for his recusal, even claiming that he had no attorney general.\n\nSessions' official recusal statement in March 2017 said he separated himself from \"any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for president of the United States\" last year after conferring with \"relevant senior career department officials.\"\n\nThis time around, Whitaker, too, is consulting top DOJ officials. The Justice Department, after days of silence, confirmed to CBS News correspondent Paula Reid that Whitaker will consult with senior ethics officials.\n\n\"Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker is fully committed to following all appropriate processes and procedures at the Department of Justice, including consulting with senior ethics officials on his oversight responsibilities and matters that may warrant recusal,\" DOJ spokesperson Kerri Kupec said.\n\nMukasey doesn't believe statements made prior to Whitaker's time at DOJ fall under a category for recusal.\n\n\"If you make statements and write articles before you take office, that doesn't require you to recuse yourself,\" Mukasey said.\n\nBut Whitaker doesn't have to follow through with any recommendation made.\n\n\"As a practical matter, any recusal decision will rest with Whitaker, and it seems highly unlikely that he will recuse himself from the Mueller investigation, given the history of recusal with former Attorney General Sessions,\" Mintz said.\n\nWhat about Whitaker's appointment in the first place?\n\nStill, Whitaker's appointment itself is facing legal questions. Maryland's attorney general has already filed a lawsuit claiming Whitaker's appointment is \"illegal and unconstitutional.\"\n\n\"The Constitution and Congress have established vitally important processes for filling high-level vacancies in the federal government,\" Attorney General Brian Frosh said in a statement. \"Few positions are more critical than that of U.S. Attorney General, an office that wields enormous enforcement power and authority over the lives of all Americans. President Trump's brazen attempt to flout the law and Constitution in bypassing Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rosenstein in favor of a partisan and unqualified staffer cannot stand.\"\n\nLonergan pointed out that Article II of the Constitution says the president may nominate principal officers \"with the advice and consent of the Senate.\" The Federal Vacancies Reform Act does allow for a 210-day window for a non-Senate confirmed selection to serve as an \"acting officer,\" but Lonergan said the Constitution may \"trump\" that vacancy law. Further, federal law says the deputy attorney general shall fill the vacancy left by an attorney general.\n\n\"So it's not entirely clear, but it's arguably unconstitutional to put him into a high-level Cabinet principal officer\" position, Lonergan said.\n\nCBS News correspondent Paula Reid contributed to this report.", "Michelle Obama still stands by her motto, \"When they go low, we go high,\" asking, \"What's the alternative?\"\n\n\"You learn that vindication in the moment is so short term,\" the former first lady told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King in an interview that will air Wednesday.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez gave a one-star review to Amazon's plans to put its second headquarters in Queens, saying her constituents have responded with \"outrage.\"\n\nThe 29-year-old Democratic socialist, who will represent part of Queens, said Amazon's plans to open HQ2 in the Long Island City neighborhood could overburden the community and push out its working class while reaping gigantic government tax breaks.\n\n\"Amazon is a billion-dollar company. The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here,\" she wrote Tuesday night in one of several tweets about the Amazon arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019ve been getting calls and outreach from Queens residents all day about this. The community\u2019s response? Outrage. https://t.co/Jl4OIfa4gC \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) November 13, 2018\n\nShe added in another tweet, \"Displacement is not community development. Investing in luxury condos is not the same thing as investing in people and families. Shuffling working class people out of a community does not improve their quality of life.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez also asked whether Amazon will offer high wages and collective bargaining, and if it plans to hire people who are already in the community. Amazon has said the new jobs will have an average wage over $150,000, and the company has so far suppressed unionization efforts from its workforce.\n\nOcasio-Cortez will represent a part of Queens near Long Island City. The congresswoman who represents Long Island City, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, has not commented on the plan since it was confirmed, and her office did not immediately comment to CBS News. Maloney was one of several Queens officials who signed a letter promoting New York when Amazon was considering it.\n\nAmazon confirmed on Tuesday that its much-hyped HQ2 will open in Long Island City and in Arlington, Virginia, after a 14-month bidding war among 238 cities. The company said it would invest $5 billion and create more than 50,000 jobs in the two locations, and receive more than $1.5 billion in tax credits and grants over the next decade from New York's government.\n\nThis will bring one of the world's largest companies to the fastest-developing neighborhood in the United States, let alone New York City. Once a sleepy industrial area on the East River, Long Island City has rapidly expanded in the past decade, with more than 12,000 apartments built there since 2010 and thousands more in development, according to a 2017 study by the housing listing service RENTCaf\u00e9.\n\nThat explosive expansion means the Amazon plan has been met with a mix of support and skepticism. In addition to Ocasio-Cortez, New York State Sen. Mike Gianaris and New York City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer \u2014 who both represent Long Island City \u2014 have spoken out against HQ2.\n\n\"Offering massive corporate welfare from scarce public resources to one of the wealthiest corporations in the world at a time of great need in our state is just wrong,\" Gianaris and Van Bramer said in a joint statement. They added that they \"were not elected to serve as Amazon drones.\"\n\nGianaris and Van Bramer were both among the Queens officials, along with Maloney, who signed the letter last year supporting New York as a choice for HQ2. Van Bramer said in a statement at the time that the headquarters \"would be an ideal fit for Long Island City and for the entire borough of Queens.\"\n\nMeanwhile, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio welcomed Amazon to the city, writing on Twitter, \"New York City is about to get tens of thousands of new, good paying jobs and Amazon is about to meet the most talented work force in the world in one of the most diverse places on the planet.\"\n\nDays before the deal was reported, de Blasio said Long Island City will receive $180 million from the city for development projects. The announcement and investment strategy made no mention of Amazon.\n\nAn analysis by Good Jobs First, an economic policy resource center in Washington, D.C., found that most of the 20 cities that were finalists for HQ2, including New York, did not publicly disclose full details about the bids offered to Amazon and kept taxpayers in the dark about how their money might be used to win the deal.", "Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh filed a motion challenging the appointment of Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker in an existing lawsuit over the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Frosh, a Democrat, is seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the federal government from responding to the suit while Whitaker is acting attorney general, and called on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to replace him.\n\nFrosh filed suit against the Trump administration in September for failing to defend the ACA in a federal case brought by Texas alleging the law is no longer constitutional. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the ACA in 2012. In a statement in September, Frosh said, \"we cannot allow President Trump and Attorney General Sessions to destroy the ACA.\"\n\nFormer Attorney General Jeff Sessions was a defendant in the lawsuit. He was forced to resign last week, and Mr. Trump replaced him with Whitaker, Sessions' former chief of staff.\n\nIn the motion filed Tuesday, Frosh argued that Whitaker could not be the case's new defendant, as his appointment was illegal and unconstitutional.\n\nFrosh asserted Whitaker's appointment violated the Appointment Clause of the Constitution, which requires \"principal officers\" \u2014 officials who report directly to the president \u2014 to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Rosenstein was confirmed by the Senate as deputy attorney general.\n\nFrosh also made the case that Whitaker's appointment violates the Attorney General Succession Act, which dictates that \"in the case of a vacancy in the office of the Attorney General ... the Deputy Attorney General may exercise all the duties of that office.\" The Vacancies Reform Act, which outlines the replacement process for vacancies across the executive branch, allows the president to appoint a non-Senate-confirmed official to serve in an acting capacity. However, Frosh argued in the motion that the Attorney General Succession Act \"is directed to one particular office, whereas the Vacancies Reform Act applies to more than 1,000 positions.\"\n\n\"The very point of the Attorney General Succession Act is to ensure that the Nation's highest law enforcement official is a Senate-confirmed officer within the chain of command of the Department of Justice\u2014one whom the Senate has already considered with the possibility of such performance of the Attorney General's functions in mind\u2014 and to forbid the President from appointing a hand-picked employee to that role,\" Frosh wrote in the motion.\n\nFrosh also argued Whitaker's appointment was politically motivated, as the new acting attorney general has expressed skepticism about the special counsel's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, which Mr. Trump has repeatedly called a \"witch hunt.\" Whitaker has also criticized the ACA.\n\n\"The Constitution and Congress have established vitally important processes for filling high-level vacancies in the federal government,\" Frosh said in a statement. \"Few positions are more critical than that of U.S. Attorney General, an office that wields enormous enforcement power and authority over the lives of all Americans. President Trump's brazen attempt to flout the law and Constitution in bypassing Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rosenstein in favor of a partisan and unqualified staffer cannot stand.\"", "PONTIAC, Mich. \u2014 A white retired firefighter has been sentenced to at least four years in prison for shooting at a black teenager who came to his suburban Detroit home asking for directions to school.

He told police he missed a school bus on April 12 and knocked on Zeigler's door in Rochester Hills after getting lost. He ran after seeing a man inside the house grab a gun.\n\nZeigler, 53, said he woke up to his wife's screams and that she believed someone was trying to break into their home.

Walker was not injured.\n\n\"I wanted to fire more up in the air, more towards my shoulder, and I didn't get the chance to because like I said, it was slippery, and I didn't have a good grip on the gun,\" Zeigler testified. \"I felt extremely remorseful.

Not fair, must change!\" Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nThe Wine Institute, an industry trade group based in California, notes that European Union tariffs on American wine exports are in some cases nearly double those of U.S. tariffs. The EU's import tariff on U.S. wine ranges from 11 cents to 29 cents per 750 ml bottle; the U.S. puts a 5 cent to 14 cent tariff on wine imports, according to trade data. The tariff range depends on the percentage of alcohol in a given bottle of wine.\n\nThe U.S. and European Union are each other's largest wine export markets, according to the Wine Institute. Some other countries apply much stiffer tariffs on American-made wine. U.S. exports to India face a whopping 150 percent tariff, for instance.\n\nOn Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs.

American wine exports, 97 percent of which are from California, reached $1.5 billion last year, according to the Wine Institute. About $553 million of that went to the EU.\n\nMr. Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in July announced an agreement to work toward resolving trade issues. The EU is also concerned about potential tariffs on autos, something Mr. Trump is considering anew, according to a report Axios.\n\nUnlike the auto industry, U.S. winemakers are more optimistic a trade war can be avoided.\n\n\"Wine Institute believes the upcoming trade negotiations between the U.S. and EU will create market opportunities by reducing tariffs and addressing other market access issues,\" said Robert Koch, CEO of the Wine Institute, in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nTuesday's tweets come after Mr. Trump's visit to France on the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I this past week, where Mr. Macron indirectly took aim at Mr. Trump, who missed a ceremony due to rain.\n\nTrump wine\n\nThe Trump family is no stranger to the wine business.

There are several other wine-related entities listed with Virginia under the Trump name.\n\nCalifornia exporters are already dealing with retaliatory tariffs from one of its fastest-growing markets: China. Even with the threat of those tariffs, U.S. exports were up 14 percent through June, according to a September release from the Wine Institute.\n\nChina imposed the tariffs in response to some $250 billion in tariffs on exports to the U.S. imposed by the White House. One area where U.S. winemakers are happy with Trump trade policies?

It's just sometimes people think my vote doesn't count, and that's just so wrong, you know? Voting matters and the people who go to the polls determine how the country is going to be lead,\" Obama said on Tuesday. \"The notion that voting doesn't work, that it's fixed. It's not.\"\n\nIn her new memoir, \"Becoming,\" Mrs. Obama slams President Trump and describes her shock the night she learned he would replace her husband in the Oval Office, writing she tried to \"block it all out.\" She also denounces Mr. Trump's \"birther\" campaign which sought to question her husband's citizenship, writing it was \"deliberately meant to stir up the wingnuts and kooks.\"\n\nLast week's midterms, widely considered a referendum on President Trump, saw record voter turnout and a number of history-making candidates elevated to office. Democrats regained control of the House of Representatives while Republicans maintained their hold on the Senate. While some viewed the results as a split decision on the president, Michelle Obama saw it as a sign that Americans are ready for change.\n\n\"We saw in this midterm, people wanted the country to move in a different direction and they came out in record numbers and they voted and that's how it works. And it works that way every time, Gayle. Every time. It's not a secret,\" Obama said.\n\nKing also asked her what it's like to watch the Trump administration attempt to dismantle seemingly every one of her and husband's legacies, from the Affordable Care Act to DACA.\n\n\"You know the truth is, the presidency isn't ours to own, you know. It's the people's job. So I always find it interesting when people say, 'How do you feel about...?' And it's not how me and Barack feel. We did our jobs. We did the best that we could do, you know.

Protesters called for Democrats, who will have a substantial majority in the House next year, to create a select committee to develop a plan to switch to 100 percent renewable energy.\n\nThe demonstration was spurred by a recent United Nations report which showed that the world only has 12 years to limit global warming to manageable levels. Ocasio-Cortez, who is in Washington for new member orientation, spoke before a group of protesters with signs bearing slogans such as \"Green Jobs For All.\"\n\nPablo Martinez Monsivais / AP\n\n\"I just want to let you know how pride I am of each and every single one of you for putting yourselves, and your bodies, and everything on the line to make sure that we save our planet, our generation, and our future,\" Ocasio-Cortez said, as a group of protesters sat circled around her. Pelosi was not at her office at the time.\n\nIn a response to the protests, Pelosi said in a statement that she was \"inspired by the energy and activism of the many young activists and advocates leading the way on the climate crisis.\"\n\n\"I have recommended to my House Democratic colleagues that we reinstate the select committee to address the climate crisis,\" she said in the statement. \"We welcome the presence of these activists, and we strongly urge the Capitol Police to allow them to continue to organize and participate in our democracy.\"\n\nPelosi, who is running to serve as speaker of the House for the second time, has faced opposition from some of the younger and more progressive members of the House. Several new members promised as candidates that they would not support Pelosi as speaker. Earlier this month, Ocasio-Cortez told \"Democracy Now\" that she was not committed to supporting Pelosi.\n\nWariness by some members about the embattled Democratic leader has been met with shows of support by Pelosi allies. An open letter is being circulated by her supporters telling Pelosi that \"we applaud your battle-tested record of delivering major accomplishments in the face of great challenges.\"\n\n\"Now that we are faced with unprecedented threats to our democracy, women, minorities, and even the most basic American values by President Trump, we need your effective leadership more than ever to advance our efforts to help hard-working families get ahead,\" the letter continued. It is not yet clear how many members have signed the letter.\n\nMeanwhile, groups such as Justice Democrats remain wary of Pelosi's commitment to progressive policies.\n\n\"Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party leadership must get serious about the climate and our economy,\" said Justice Democrats communications director Waleed Shahid. \"Anything less is tantamount to denying the reality of climate change. The hopeful part is that we're ushering in a new generation of leaders into the Democratic Party who understand the urgency and will help build a movement to create the political will for bold action.\"\n\nBo Erickson contributed to this report", "Sources familiar with President Trump's thinking said Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristjen Nielsen is destined to leave the administration, but the timing remains unclear \u2014 as do the repercussions the move could have within the White House. Any move involving Nielsen could set off something of a White House chain reaction, and that may influence what does or does not happen, and the timing therein.\n\nNielsen has fallen in and out of favor with Mr. Trump, and she may fall victim to a sense of White House frustration with its stalled immigration agenda, even though Nielsen has been a vocal advocate for Trump policies. If Mr. Trump were to ditch Nielsen, he will have removed his two fiercest Cabinet immigration policy advocates \u2014 former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his DHS secretary.\n\nMr. Trump's frustrations do not always result in firings or resignations. Nielsen's status is influenced by another factor: the president's satisfaction, or lack thereof, with Chief of Staff John Kelly. Nielsen was Kelly's chief of staff at DHS and followed him to the White House. Kelly has made it clear he would oppose the firing of Nielsen or her forced resignation.\n\nIf the president were to dump Nielsen, many sources familiar with the White House see an inevitable clash between Mr. Trump and Kelly \u2014 one that could result in Kelly's departure. Interpretations of the quality of Mr. Trump's relationship with Kelly vary.\n\nMr. Trump has been advised to bring on a chief of staff better suited to and familiar with the rough and tumble of a re-election campaign. He is weighing that advice, sources said, more seriously than before the midterms.\n\nAccording to four sources, Nick Ayers, currently chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, is the leading contender to replace Kelly \u2014 if Kelly departs.\n\nAyers is considered one of the best political strategists in Trump world, and advocates say he could provide crucial help to the White House, as previous chiefs of staff have, in meshing with and reinforcing the re-election campaign messaging, strategy, presidential travel and fundraising. Ayers was important to Pence's arrival on the Trump ticket, worked at a high level on the transition and is considered deeply loyal to the Trump agenda.\n\nOthers mentioned as possible successors to Kelly include Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and current House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nMulvaney's name has surfaced before as chief of staff and in the past he has expressed interest. Those close to Mulvaney said he has cooled to the idea. But he remains a contender and may have adopted the strategy of seeming less interested to improve his chances.\n\nMnuchin remains close to Mr. Trump and his family and has been a stalwart since the campaign and through the transition. Mnuchin has also been a staunch advocate for Mr. Trump's economic and sanctions policy. Even so, he may lack the necessary political skills for a re-election campaign.\n\nMcCarthy has forged a strong relationship with Mr. Trump and has considerable political skills. House GOP sources said he appears content to stay in the chamber and emerge as minority leader when the new Congress commenced early next year.\n\nThe Nielsen saga has yet to play out. As one source said, \"things are stagnant\" in terms of decision making.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House counsel's office, visibly under-staffed, is trying to recruit high-visibility legal talent for coming House Democratic investigations. There is also a push, according to sources, to place highly experienced lawyers in prominent Cabinet agencies likely to face House Democratic inquiries. These may be among the most important short-term personnel decisions for the Trump White House, though they will likely generate few headlines or public commentary.\n\nOn top of that, Mr. Trump is still looking for an attorney general nominee. That process has been bogged down by White House fretting over Senate elections that in Arizona turned against the Republican nominee, and the ongoing Florida Senate recount. In essence, the White House appears to be holding off, wanting to know how large the Senate GOP majority will be before settling on a nominee -- in part to see how many votes it could spare if the confirmation fight becomes difficult.\n\nLastly, Mr. Trump needs to replace outgoing U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. The boomlet for State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert appears to have faded, and based on her recent appearances at the White House, namely the election night party, U.S. Ambassador to Canada Kelly Night Craft may have moved into the lead.", "If you're like most Americans, you rely increasingly on your smartphone to check email, use social media, read news, arrange dates, play games and conduct a host of other mobile activities.

Go back to your room and give the phone to an adult.\"\n\nTrump says tariffs \"not fair, must change!\"\n\nMr. Trump also complained Tuesday about tariffs on U.S. wines sold in France and appeared to take a dig at Macron's low public approval rating.\n\nThe president tweeted that French tariffs on American wine were, \"not fair, must change!\"\n\n\"On Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair, must change!\"\n\nNearly all U.S. wine exports to major markets, including the European Union -- of which France is a part -- face tariffs, according to the Wine Institute, which represents California winemakers in Washington on matters of tax, trade and regulatory issues.\n\nMr. Trump, who built a career as a businessman before he entered politics, opened a winery in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2011.", "", "Hate crimes in the U.S. rose about 17 percent in 2017 compared to the previous year, according to data released Tuesday by the FBI. The Uniform Crime Reporting Program's Hate Crime Statistics report, which comprises incidents reported to the federal government by law enforcement agencies, shows 7,175 hate crime incidents in 2017 compared with 6,121 incidents in 2016. The 2017 incidents encompass 8,437 total offenses, meaning some involved multiple criminal charges.\n\nThe FBI notes, however, the number of law enforcement agencies reporting the crimes also increased, with about 1,000 additional agencies contributing data. This is the third year in a row the FBI has reported an increase in hate crimes \u2014 reports spiked about 5 percent between 2015 and 2016.\n\nThe vast majority of the incidents reported, 7,106, were \"single-bias\" hate-crime incidents, while 69 incidents stemmed from multiple biases. Of the \"single-bias\" hate crime incidents, which encompass 8,126 offenses, 8,493 victims, and 6,307 known offenders \u2014 the data shows:\n\nThe offenses were most commonly motivated by hatred over race, ethnicity or ancestry, at a rate of 59.6 percent\n\n\n\n20.6 percent of the offenses were motivated by hatred over religion\n\n\n\n15.8 percent stemmed from sexual orientation bias\n\n\n\nBias over disability comprised 1.9 percent\n\n\n\nGender identity hatred comprised 1.6 percent, and gender bias .6 percent\n\n\n\nMost of the total 8,437 offenses \u2014 about 5,000 \u2014 were categorized as crimes against persons such as intimidation, assault, murder or rape, while about 3,000 were considered crimes against property such as vandalism, robbery or burglary. Some were categorized as both. Most \u2014 78.3 percent \u2014 targeted individuals, while others targeted businesses, government entities or religious organizations.\n\nOf crimes motivated by race, ancestry or ethnicity, about 48.8 percent were motivated by hatred against African Americans, 17.5 percent stemmed from bias against whites, and 10.9 percent were classified as anti-Latino or anti-Hispanic bias.\n\nOf crimes motivated by hatred over religion, 58.1 percent targeted those of Jewish faith and 18.7 percent targeted those of Muslim faith, the report says. In 2016, 54.2 percent of hate crimes were anti-Jewish while 24.8 percent were anti-Muslim.\n\nIn a statement, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said he was \"particularly troubled by the increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes.\"\n\n\"The American people can be assured that this department has already taken significant and aggressive actions against these crimes and that we will vigorously and effectively defend their rights,\" the statement said.\n\nThe FBI said the hate crime data \"allows the public, researchers, community leaders and local government to raise awareness of the issue and gain a more accurate picture of hate crimes,\" and also allows law enforcement to develop prevention strategies.\n\nWhitaker called the report a \"call to action \u2014 and we will heed that call.\"", "Rush Monday and Quinton Neal, two second grade students from Reidsville, North Carolina, are inseparable. They're so close, they say they're twins. The boys often dress alike and they're always there to help one another when one is down.\n\nSo, when Rush got in a car accident, 8-year-old Quinton was worried for his best friend.\n\nRush's mom, Tara Monday, told CBS News she was driving with her daughter and son when the devastating accident occurred in October. \"It was kind of bad weather here ... And all of a sudden, a car crossed the center line and hit us head-on,\" Monday said. \"It was the scariest moment of our lives. And Rush was injured the worst out of all of us.\"\n\nTara Monday\n\nThe family was taken to a hospital and separated into different rooms. Monday's 7-year-old son had internal bleeding and had to be rushed into surgery. \"Rush was feeling very scared and sad and defeated,\" Monday said. \"He's only 7. He was in a lot of pain. And he didn't want to move, he did not want to get up and walk.\"\n\nWhen Monday told Rush Quinton was coming to the hospital for a visit, he immediately perked up. \"And he said, 'When Quinton comes, I'll get up and walk,'\" Monday said.\n\nTara Monday\n\nSure enough, Quinton and his family visited Rush and the 7-year-old kept his side of the bargain. He agreed to try walking again \u2013only if his best friend was by his side. Rush's family took video of the two second-graders walking side by side down the hospital hallway.\n\nIt was difficult for Rush, who was hunched over. But Quinton gave him the strength, and helped teach his friend how to walk again.\n\nThe video of the boys' short walk down the hospital hallway together went viral, and their story is inspiring people across America, and their moms couldn't be prouder.\n\nShamicka Neal\n\nRush's mom pointed out that her son is larger than Quinton, despite them being in the same grade. Rush is white and Quinton is black. And despite these differences, they're still best friends \u2013 or twins, as they say.\n\n\"They don't see in size difference, they don't see in color differences. We don't see like that,\" Monday said. \"And we want Rush and Quinton just to show the world, 'Hey, it doesn't have to stop when you're seven and eight. It can be like this all the time.'\"\n\nWhen asked about how close they are, Rush and Quinton said in unison, \"we're brothers from another mother.\"", "Don't hire someone you can't fire, like the son of a campaign donor or the child of the mayor. No matter what you may have said during the campaign about changing Congress, hire enough Hill veterans to make the office run smoothly. And make sure the person answering the phone sounds like folks from back home.\n\nThat's only some of the advice headed for the historic class of House freshmen of both major political parties streaming into Washington this week for orientation on the nuts and bolts underpinning a job like none other.\n\nUnder tight security, new members and their staffs pulled up in front of a hotel about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from the Capitol on Tuesday. A bank of cameras and a table marked \"luggage drop-off\" awaited their arrivals in the morning chill.\n\n\"I'm just trying to figure out what's going on,\" said Rep.-elect Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., a former member of the state legislature. \"I figure that we're the small fish in a very big pond right now.\"\n\nThey are a younger generation of lawmakers \u2014 including a record number of women \u2014 arriving flush with victory and optimism. The Democrats are ready to take on President Donald Trump in the biggest and most diverse class of new lawmakers since Watergate.\n\n\"I hope that we are ushering in a new era,\" one of the class stars, Massachusetts Rep.-elect Ayanna Pressley, said Monday.\n\nThey are psyched \u2014 if not exactly unified. Even among the new Democrats, there's an uncomfortable vote looming on whether Rep. Nancy Pelosi, former speaker of the House, should lead them. Rep.-elect Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., on Monday became the latest House Democrat newcomer to say she won't vote for Pelosi because she wants \"new leadership.\" Pelosi has said she expects to become speaker again.\n\nPressley and several of her classmates made their Washington debut on Monday in a packed news conference whose setting suggested as much about the new majority's intentions as the agenda they described. Gathered in the atrium of the AFL-CIO down the street from the White House, they appeared as the newest members of the ascendant House Progressive Caucus, dedicated to universal health care and new climate policy. The incoming majority, including a gain of at least 32 seats, will be fighting a Republican-led Senate and a president with a history of tweeting trouble for people who displease him.\n\nAnd the newly elected Republicans are on the same side as Trump, at least in theory.\n\nBut for both parties of newcomers, those big questions are for later. The first votes on Pelosi, for example, won't unfold until after Thanksgiving. And the new Congress, the 116th session, doesn't convene until Jan. 3.\n\nNow, for many newcomers, it's a scramble to stand up offices in the warren of Capitol Hill and back home in House districts that each represent more than 700,000 people. Every office has a budget. And every freshman who doesn't already have a home in pricey Washington will have to figure out how to rent an apartment, or maybe just keep a rollaway bed in the office, on a $174,000 salary.\n\n\"We focus on getting them to appreciate that there are certain activities that they have to do in the next 90 days,\" said Bradford Fitch, president and CEO of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Congressional Management Foundation, which is among those briefing new members.\n\nThe new crop of lawmakers includes a lot of firsts.\n\nFor the first time, two Native American women are headed to the House, in addition to two Muslim congresswomen-elect. Massachusetts and Connecticut also will send black women to Congress as firsts for their states.\n\nBut not every freshman is new to Washington.\n\nRep.-elect Donna Shalala of Florida was health and human services secretary to President Bill Clinton. Former NFL linebacker Colin Allred of Texas is a civil rights lawyer who worked in President Barack Obama's housing department. Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat, is an Obama administration alumnus who served as a civilian adviser in Iraq.\n\nWhatever their background, every newly elected member is heading for a job as one of 435 colleagues in Washington juggling what can sometimes be a seven-day-a-week job of votes, constituent requests and committee meetings. All the while, those who intend to return are already thinking about \u2014 and soon will be fundraising for \u2014 their 2020 re-election campaigns.\n\nBut first things first, Fitch said. At the progressive caucus briefing for new members on Monday, he handed out a 300-page book, \"Setting Course: A Congressional Management Guide,\" updated for the incoming Congress. It sets out everything from hiring a core staff in November and December to the culture of Congress.\n\nChapter One talks about Dos and Don'ts of these first days. Do learn to delegate, for example. Don't \"skip the House/Senate orientations and party organizational activities.\"\n\nAnd don't \"try to do everything.\"\n\nDuring this period, \"they don't have to come up with a solution to the Middle East crisis,\" Fitch said.", "", "Stephen Colbert paid tribute to late Marvel legend Stan Lee on the \"Late Show\" Monday. Colbert eulogized the beloved \"God of the Marvel Universe\" and thanked Lee for creating characters like Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, Black Panther and the Fantastic Four. Kirk Schenck, an attorney for Lee's daughter, J.C. Lee, confirmed to CBS News that Lee, 95, died at a Los Angeles hospital on Monday.\n\n\"Today, the world lost a legend,\" Colbert said. \"Marvel Comics co-founder Stan Lee, Stan the man. Lee had a hand in creating all your favorite comic-book characters. Lee was also a World War II veteran, a screenwriter and married to his wife Joanie for 70 years. After they dated for two weeks, they flew to Reno so she could get a quickie divorce and marry Stan the same day. That's a story.\"\n\nThe host continued, \"So thanks for all the stories, Stan, and I know you're hearing this a lot today, but 'Excelsior.'\"\n\n\"Excelsior\" was Lee's signature sign-off.\n\nColbert talked about being a Marvel fan himself and pointed out a Captain America shield he keeps on set: \"from when Captain America died, he left me the shield in his will.\"\n\nMobile users can watch the video here\n\nHugh Jackman, who has played Wolverine in nine films, joined Colbert on set and said of Lee, \"Let me say to the family and legions of fans that I remember Stan as a true gentleman who had a glint in his eye. He's a creative genius. He thought outside the box. He created a whole universe that changed the lives of many people, mine included.\"\n\nJackman also recalled a time he felt overshadowed by Lee's star on the red carpet: \"I was the only one was on there and no one was taking my photo because at the other end was Stan Lee ... Stan, God bless you, you're one of the greats.\"\n\nMany other actors who play Marvel heroes paid tribute to Lee as well. On Monday, Chris Evans wrote, \"There will never be another Stan Lee.

He exuded love and kindness and will leave an indelible mark on so, so, so many lives. Excelsior!!\"\n\nWinston Duke tweeted, \"THANK YOU, @TheRealStanLee.

The ecommerce giant will receive $1.5 billion in incentives from New York and $573 million from Virginia as part of its promise to create 25,000 high-paying jobs in each location, the company said.\n\nSplitting its headquarters into two will make it easier for the company to hire workers with technology industry experience, while also reducing the strain on a particular area. In its announcement, Amazon said that \"attracting top talent was the leading driver\" for its decision, while acknowledging that tax and other economic incentives were also a factor.\n\nThe company also said it will create a third, smaller operations hub in Nashville, Tennessee, that will hire up to 5,000 full-time workers.

Even though the high school is in the city of Parkland, the cellphone calls rang at a 911 call center in Coral Springs, a city south of the school. That's because the calls were routed to a cell tower just a short distance from the school on the south side of the Sawgrass Expressway.\n\nCBS Miami obtained a large portion of the calls after filing a public records request with the Broward Sheriff's Office. The calls shed new light on how agencies involved shared information.\n\nOne of the first calls Coral Springs 911 dispatchers received came as confessed school shooter Nikolas Cruz roamed the halls of the high school's freshman building. It came from a student who said he was on the the building's third floor.\n\n\"Are they getting closer to you?\" the dispatcher asked. \"Yeah,\" the student responded.\n\nThe dispatcher asked whether the classroom door was locked and wanted to know if there was imminent danger. \"The shooter's not in the classroom, right?\" the dispatcher asked. \"No,\" the student said.\n\nAnd after 90 seconds, after the gunshots ended, the dispatcher reassured the student that help was on the way. The dispatcher then said she had to go.\n\n\"OK, listen to me,\" the dispatcher said. \"I've gotta answer some more calls so I'm gonna let you go. You guys stay in the classroom. If for some reason, they get in your classroom, call me back.\"\n\n\"Please don't,\" said the student.\n\n\"I promise you, we have a lot of people coming,\" said the dispatcher. Seconds later, the call dropped. A dial tone can be heard.\n\nAnother call soon came in.\n\n\"Hi, I'm a teacher still on the third floor of 1200 building,\" the voice said. The teacher asked for help and the dispatcher wanted to know if anyone was hurt. The dispatcher reminded the teacher to keep all cellphones on vibrate and to stay quiet.\n\n\"I promise we have a lot of units coming to you,\" the dispatcher said. \"Obviously our phones are \u2026 everybody's calling but I want you to continue to just monitor. Call us back if you hear any more gunshots or anything like that, OK?\"\n\nNeither of the calls were transferred to the lead agency responsible for investigating the shooting, the Broward Sheriff's Office (BSO). And of the more than 15 calls received by Coral Springs 911 dispatchers from students and teachers inside the freshman building, BSO said only three were transferred to them.\n\nThe National Fire Protection Association said they suggest calls be transferred to the lead agency within 30 seconds. But that is simply a guideline and not a mandatory requirement.\n\nNational experts in emergency dispatch said these types of issues where one city or agency receives 911 calls for a neighboring city or agency are not new. They've been occurring for a long time as city and county borders do not obey the laws of cellphone technology. Once a cellphone call is made, it goes to the nearest tower and is answered by the 911 dispatcher in that city or county.\n\nSeveral experts in 911 dispatch said it's possible the bulk of calls did not get transferred because the information was considered repetitive and dispatchers didn't want to unduly burden BSO.\n\nIn another call, a calm yet urgent voice answered the phone at the Coral Springs 911 call center.\n\n\"Hello, I'm at Stoneman Douglas High School and I think there's a shooter,\" the caller said quickly. In this case, the dispatcher immediately reached out to BSO.\n\n\"We're getting multiple calls,\" the BSO dispatcher said, adding that BSO was sending units to the school.\n\nThe BSO dispatcher asked if Coral Springs was sending \"rescue\" to the school and the Coral Springs dispatcher said that paramedics could not enter the school until it was safe for them to enter the building.\n\nIn another call, a key detail about the shooter's whereabouts appears to have been miscommunicated to BSO.\n\nA person from inside Stoneman Douglas called 911 and a Coral Springs 911 dispatcher answered.\n\n\"Do you know where they're at?\" the dispatcher asked about the shooter. \"They're in the freshman building, it's in the student lot.\"\n\n\"In the student lot?\" the dispatcher asked. \"Yes,\" the caller said.\n\nThe dispatcher asked: \"Do you know how many shooters there are?\" The caller answered: \"No.\"\n\nWith that information, the 911 dispatcher attempted to connect the call to BSO, however the caller either hung up or the phone disconnected. The dispatcher relayed the information he had.\n\n\"This person is advising there is a shooter at Douglas in Parkland,\" the dispatcher said. \"(The caller) is in a safe spot. He's advising the shooter is in the north parking lot.\"\n\nIt's unclear where the shooter was at that precise moment, but reporting indicates that Cruz left the building with a group of students.\n\nOn the calls, you hear Coral Springs dispatchers in a wide range of situations. They attempt to help students in the building do CPR on victims, reassure parents of students who are desperate for information and offering kind, uplifting words for people inside the building concerned for their safety and the safety of their friends and teachers.\n\nCBS Miami played a number of the Coral Springs 911 calls for Chuck Lanza, former Emergency Management Director for Broward County. He said he was impressed by the work of the dispatchers.\n\n\"Very calm, very reassuring to the children,\" Lanza said. \"In terms of their communications skills, they did a nice job.\"\n\nLanza also said: \"Best case scenario they would have transferred all those calls over to BSO after they got the information they needed for EMS. Many of them didn't get transferred over and that could have caused some problems on the BSO side.\"\n\nCBS Miami asked both the Broward Sheriff's Office and the city of Coral Springs to respond to questions about how the 911 calls were handled and how it might have impacted the response to the tragedy. Both agencies declined to answer, citing the ongoing investigations by the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public Safety Commission and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.\n\nOne of the questions raised is whether any outcome would have changed at the school if all of the calls Coral Springs 911 received were transferred immediately to BSO.", "CNN filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration Tuesday morning demanding the return of the White House credentials of Jim Acosta, CNN's chief White House correspondent. The White House last week suspended Acosta's \"hard pass,\" which allows him press access to the White House, hours after he sparred with President Trump at a press briefing.\n\nCNN says it has asked the court for an immediate restraining order requiring the pass be returned to Acosta, and will seek permanent relief as part of this process.\n\nThe suit was filed in D.C. District Court.\n\nIn a statement, the White House Correspondents Association said it \"strongly supports\" the suit. \"Revoking access to the White House complex amounted to disproportionate reaction to the events of last Wednesday,\" it said. \"The president of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him.\"\n\nDuring Acosta's exchange with President Trump last Wednesday, a White House intern reached over and tried to take the microphone away from him. The White House accused Acosta of placing his hands on the young woman and distributed a video of the incident that several analysts concluded was doctored to exaggerate the moment of contact.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders called the lawsuit \"just more grandstanding from CNN.\" The White House initially said it was revoking Acosta's hard pass because he land hands on an intern, but Sanders' new statement said he \"physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern.\"\n\n\"We have been advised that CNN has filed a complaint challenging the suspension of Jim Acosta's hard pass. This is just more grandstanding from CNN, and we will vigorously defend against this lawsuit,\" Sanders said. \"CNN, who has nearly 50 additional hard pass holders, and Mr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment. After Mr. Acosta asked the president two questions\u2014each of which the president answered\u2014he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions. This was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters. The White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional. The First Amendment is not served when a single reporter, of more than 150 present, attempts to monopolize the floor. If there is no check on this type of behavior it impedes the ability of the president, the White House staff, and members of the media to conduct business.\"\n\nHere's CNN's complaint.", "", "When it comes to high-tech toys and gadgets as gifts, consumers concerned about privacy should be wary. Some products can be hacked and used to track the owner's whereabouts, or take private videos or images and share them online.\n\nThat led researchers at Mozilla, the open-source software development group behind the Firefox browser, to answer this question: What could go wrong when a connected product comes without encryption, needs to use a password or doesn't delete stored data? To find out, they took a look at 70 products that could make for gifts -- and security risks -- this holiday season.\n\nIn a shopping guide released on Wednesday, Mozilla found just under half, or 33 of the products, met its minimum security standards. They include five basics: The product must use encryption; the maker must provide automatic security updates; if a product uses a password, it must be a strong one; the maker must have a way to manage security vulnerabilities found in its products; and it must have an accessible privacy policy.\n\nThe remaining 37 products did not meet Mozilla's security bar, or the results on them were inconclusive.\n\nHere's the rundown of some of products deemed unworthy of Mozilla's minimum standards to address privacy concerns:\n\nMozilla\n\nThe Amazon Kindle, which retails from $79.99 to $249.99, can't spy on you because it doesn't have a camera, microphone or tracking device. But because it doesn't require you to change the default setting of no password, someone could easily swipe the reading device and buy the complete set of Harry Potter, sending you the bill.\n\nMozilla\n\nThis petcam from Wagz retails for $169.99 and includes an app that shares all your furry friend's activities to social media. What could go wrong? \"Bad people could hack in, spy on you like you spy on your dog, then post creepy pics to your social media,\" according to the guidebook.\n\nMozilla\n\nMade by zerotech, this $169 drone is among the cheapest and smallest -- it'll fit into many pockets. Now for the bad news:\n\n\"This drone doesn't seem to meet our minimum security standards and we couldn't find a privacy policy,\" said Mozilla. \"Both are bad news when it comes to a flying HD camera and app on your phone. All your pretty videos could easily be taken by someone else.\"\n\nMozilla\n\nThis little Wi-Fi connected dinosaur listens to questions, gives age-appropriate answers and grows with its owner over time. It retails for $59.99 from CogniToys, which told Mozilla the toy \"uses encryption for all audio traffic and in fact each one uses unique keys, which are also cycled per session per device.\" However, you aren't required to change the default password, and you'd need a 14th-grade reading ability to understand the privacy policy.\n\nOf six toys marketed to children that Mozilla tested, it was able to compromise the security of five.\n\nMozilla\n\nDevices meant to protect your home and family can work both ways, it seems.\n\nThe FREDI Baby Monitor \"has a history of being easily hacked, uses a default password of '123' and doesn't have a privacy policy\" that Mozilla could find from its manufacturer. \"This product does a seemingly poor job protecting privacy and security.

Whether you've bought shoes at Zappos, picked up milk at Whole Foods or listened to an audiobook on Audible, you've been caught up in Amazon's growing web of businesses.\n\nAnd now, Amazon's sprawling empire will stretch even further. The company is expected to announce Tuesday that it will open two more bases outside of its Seattle headquarters: one in Crystal City in northern Virginia and the other in New York's Long Island City neighborhood.\n\nAmazon, which got its start as an online bookstore two decades ago, has grown to a behemoth that had nearly $180 billion in revenue last year. Its workforce has ballooned to more than 610,000 employees worldwide, making it the second-largest U.S.-based, publicly traded employer behind Walmart, according to FactSet. That growth has also made its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos one of the world's richest people, with his stake in Amazon worth more than $135 billion.\n\nHere's a look at some of the various businesses Amazon has its hand in:\n\nOnline shopping\n\nE-commerce is still Amazon's biggest money maker, bringing in $108 billion in revenue last year. That's slightly more than 60 percent of its total revenue.\n\nBesides Amazon.com, it also owns several smaller sites, including shoe retailer Zappos.com, rare books seller AbeBooks.com, deal site 6pm.com and women's clothing retailer Shopbop. It recently began selling medications after purchasing online pharmacy PillPack in September for $753 million.\n\nPhysical stores\n\nAmazon's largest brick-and-mortar push was its nearly $14 billion purchase of Whole Foods last year, giving it about 500 grocery stores.\n\nIt has created its own shops, too. It has 18 Amazon bookstores, five cashier-less convenience stores and three 4-star stores, which sell toys, cookware and other items. Dozens of Amazon pop-up shops are also inside malls and Kohl's department stores, where shoppers can touch and try out its gadgets.\n\nIts physical locations had revenue of $13 billion in the first nine months of 2018.\n\nWeb services\n\nAmazon isn't just about shopping. Its Amazon Web Services unit, founded in 2006, provides cloud computing services to corporations and government agencies and is one of Amazon's fastest growing businesses.\n\nIt had revenue of $17 billion last year, about 10 percent of its total revenue.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe ads at the top of Amazon search results are becoming a big business for the company.

President Donald Trump declared after his historic summit in June that with President Kim Jong Un there was \"no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.\" But a report based on satellite imagery shows the complexity posed by an extensive network of weapons facilities that the U.S. wants to neutralize.\n\nDecades of \"concealment and deception\"\n\nA report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies has identified 13 secret facilities used to produce missiles and related technology. Although the sites are not launch facilities and in some cases are rudimentary, the authors of the report say they are hidden and illustrate the scope of the North's weapons program and the country's determination to conceal its military might.\n\n\"The dispersed deployment of these bases and distinctive tactics employed by ballistic missile units are combined with decades of extensive camouflage, concealment and deception practices to maximize the survival of its missile units from pre-emptive strikes and during wartime operations,\" they said.\n\nThe authors say the sites, which can be used for all classes of ballistic missiles, should be declared by North Korea and inspected in any credible, verifiable deal that addresses Pyongyang's most significant threats to the United States and its allies.\n\nSouth Korea says no new info in report\n\nSouth Korea's presidential office said the report didn't include any information it didn't already know. Presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said continued activity at North Korean missile sites only underlines the need for nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang to proceed at a faster pace.\n\nKim took exception to a New York Times article on the report that said North Korea was engaging in \"great deception,\" saying that the North has never promised to dismantle a short-range ballistic missile base 84 miles northwest of Seoul that was highlighted by CSIS.\n\nKim said such suggestions can \"trigger misunderstanding and potentially block dialogue ... at a time when we need dialogue between North Korea and the United States.\"\n\nSeoul has worked hard to revive nuclear negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea that have reduced fears of war in South Korea following a series of North Korean weapons tests and threats of military action by Mr. Trump last year.\n\nAn \"Interesting but unsurprising report\"?\n\nNorth Korea analysts not involved in the report said the findings were not surprising given Pyongyang's past activities but were still cause for concern. They noted that Kim had not agreed to halt either nuclear weapons or missile development in negotiations with Mr. Trump or Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n\"The fact that North Korea has continued to build nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in the midst of high-level diplomacy with China, South Korea and the U.S. should not come as a surprise,\" said Abraham Denmark, the Asia program director at The Wilson Center. \"Despite all the summitry, North Korea is just as dangerous today as it was a year ago.\"\n\n\"Improving relations with Pyongyang may be a laudable goal, but any claim that the North Korean nuclear and missile threats have been solved is either wishful thinking or purposefully deceptive,\" he said.\n\n\"Interesting but unsurprising report,\" said Kelsey Davenport, director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association. \"Kim Jong Un only committed voluntarily to halt long-range missile tests.\"\n\nThe report was released less than a week after North Korea abruptly called off a new round of negotiations with Pompeo that had been set for Thursday in New York. The cancellation, which the U.S. ascribed to scheduling issues, followed threats from North Korean officials to resume nuclear and missile testing unless U.S. sanctions are lifted.\n\nThe administration has said repeatedly that sanctions will not be lifted until a denuclearization agreement is fully implemented.", "SACRAMENTO, Calif. - California utilities again are facing severe financial pressures from the possibility that their equipment sparked catastrophic wildfires, including two that are now burning at either end of the state.\n\nThe pressure comes even though Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation in September giving utilities some relief beginning next year.\n\nThe law made it easier for utilities to pass along costs from fire-related damages to consumers and also avoid possible bankruptcy from a series of major fires that occurred during the 2017 fire season that produced more than $10 billion in losses.\n\nBut the law has a gap: No damages specific to 2018 were included, so utilities face a higher bar to bill customers to cover those costs. And this year has already supplanted 2017 as the most destructive in California's recorded history.\n\nAuthorities have not determined a cause for either of two major blazes burning now, but Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International, have reported irregularities with their equipment near the time and place where both ignited.\n\nBetsy Ann Cowley, a property owner near the site where a deadly wildfire started in Northern California, said Monday that PG&E sought access to her property just before the blaze started because the utility's power lines were causing sparks.\n\nPG&E shares have lost more than a third of their value since the Camp Fire broke out northeast of San Francisco, destroying thousands of homes and killing dozens of people as it leveled the town of Paradise.\n\nMoody's Investors Service said Monday that the \"shortcomings\" in the legislation reflect negatively on PG&E's credit rating, which is barely investment grade.\n\n\"Moody's negative outlook incorporates the view that additional financial stress for PG&E is likely,\" Moody's spokesman Joe Mielenhausen said in an email. \"Going forward, we will look for signs of additional legislative and regulatory support for the utility as it works through various legal processes.\"\n\nSparks and outages\n\n\n\nLast week PG&E told state regulators that it detected a problem on an electrical transmission line near the site of the blaze minutes before the fire broke out. The utility later said it observed damage to a transmission tower on the line, and a PG&E spokeswoman said the company will cooperate with any investigations.\n\nSouthern California Edison told regulators there was an outage on an electrical circuit near the site where the Woolsey Fire started in Ventura County. It quickly spread into Malibu and destroyed hundreds of homes.\n\nSoCal Edison said the report was submitted out of an abundance of caution, and there was no indication from fire officials that its equipment may have been involved. The report said the fire was reported around 2:24 p.m. Thursday, two minutes after the outage.\n\nShares of parent company Edison International have tumbled more than 20 percent since the fire started.\n\nAggressive lobbying\n\n\n\nCalifornia is one of just two states that hold electric companies entirely liable for damage caused by their equipment, even if they followed all safety precautions. The new law makes it easier for them to pass some of those costs along to consumers.\n\nUtilities lobbied aggressively to eliminate that strict liability standard, but lawmakers dropped the idea amid pressure from insurers, trial lawyers and fire victims.\n\nInstead, legislators passed a law making it easier for utilities to manage the costs without going bankrupt. They created two mechanisms for investor-owned utilities to shift the costs of wildfire lawsuits onto their customers -- one process that begins in 2019 and another for the 2017 fires.\n\nFor reasons that remain unclear, they law left the rules unchanged for 2018.\n\n\"The priority was on addressing 2017 victims and putting in place some fire-safety measures,\" said Paul Payne, a spokesman for Sen. Bill Dodd, a Napa Democrat and the bill's author. \"The focus was on making 2017 victims whole.\"\n\nIt's too soon to say whether the legislature will take up another fight over the 2018 fires, Payne said.\n\nBetter building codes\n\n\n\nSoCal Edison officials say lawmakers need to do more to shield utilities from wildfire-related liability.\n\n\"SCE believes the state can do more, including enacting fire-smart building codes, particularly in high fire risk areas, and ensuring the proper allocation of risk for the often-tragic consequences of wildfires,\" spokeswoman Justina Garcia wrote in an email.\n\nA PG&E spokesman, Paul Doherty, did not respond to questions about the legislation, saying \"our entire company is focused on supporting first responders.\"\n\nSen. Jerry Hill, a Redwood City Democrat and longtime critic of PG&E, called the report of troubles on PG&E's lines in the area extremely worrisome.\n\n\"At some point, we have to say enough is enough, and we have to ask: Should this company be allowed to do business in California?\" Hill said. \"These fires take a spark, and at least in the last few years fires have been caused by negligent behavior by PG&E. We need to see how we can hold them responsible or look at alternative way of doing business.\"\n\nHill said he was exploring legislative options to keep a closer check on PG&E, including the possibility of breaking up the utility.\n\n\"They are a monopoly, and they act as a monopoly,\" Hill said. \"That is a problem when the motive is profit, and that just may not be the right motive for providing utility services.\"", "A soldier says a stranger's Christmas card got him through Vietnam.

His uncanny resemblance to Ross drew dozens of comedic reactions from fans of the 1990s hit comedy, and even from other police departments around Britain.\n\nBut the police's appeal also yielded information that enabled investigators to positively identify the suspect just a day after it was posted.\n\nEarly on Tuesday, the Lancashire County police said the real suspected culprit, a 36-year-old man, was taken into custody by officers in west London's Southall neighborhood on suspicion of theft.\n\nOfficers, I swear it wasn't me.\n\nAs you can see, I was in New York.\n\nTo the hardworking Blackpool Police, good luck with the investigation.#itwasntme pic.twitter.com/EDFF9dZoYR \u2014 schwim (@DavidSchwimmer) October 24, 2018\n\nThe initial appeal to find the Schwimmer lookalike spread so quickly across social media that Schwimmer himself joined in the fun, posting a video of in which he pretends to make off with beers from a shop in New York City, with the hashtag, \"itwasn'tme.\"\n\nWhile the original appeal by the Blackpool Police was taken down from their Facebook page, a post from the following day remained up, noting that the suspect had been identified after, \"a number of positive lines of inquiry,\" and thanking everyone who had shared it for their support.\n\nThe police's latest post, confirming the arrest, also thanked Schwimmer, \"for seeing the funny side of our appeal!\"\n\nFollowing the appeal we posted looking for a man who resembles a well-known actor from the popular sitcom 'Friends', we...

Bruce Poliquin wins re-election or is ousted by Democratic state lawmaker Jared Golden.\n\nThe new way of voting in which all candidates are ranked on a ballot made its national debut in U.S. House and Senate races in Maine.\n\nUnder the system, a candidate wins with a majority of first-place votes. If there's no majority, the last-place candidate's second-place votes are reallocated to remaining candidates. The computerized process can be repeated until there's a winner.\n\nAcross the country, voting reform advocates are watching as the system faces its biggest test in the most expensive race in Maine history.\n\n\"This will either fuel the adoption of ranked-choice voting in other jurisdictions, or it will stop it in its tracks,\" said Corey Cook, dean of the School of Public Service at Boise State University, who has studied 100 elections that used the system.\n\nMaine residents approved the system in 2016 after nine of the previous 11 gubernatorial elections resulted in winners who failed to get a majority of the vote.\n\nProponents say the system allows people to vote for third-party or independent candidates without concern for political \"spoilers\" or vote-splitting. They say it also moderates campaigns because candidates don't want to alienate supporters of other candidates in the event they need second-place votes to reach a majority.\n\nCritics say the ballot and system can be confusing to voters. They also say bland campaigns don't allow candidates to differentiate themselves.\n\nThe system is sometimes referred to as an \"instant runoff\" in the dozen or so municipalities where it's used. But there's nothing instant about the process in Maine. All of the ballots, more than 600,000 of them, had to be shipped to Augusta and scanned into a computer. That process continued on Monday.\n\nIn Maine, Poliquin had an edge Tuesday night of about 2,000 first-round votes over Golden but fell far short of reaching the 50 percent threshold. That means the outcome will hinge upon second-choice votes from more than 20,000 supporters of two independents who together collected about 8 percent of the vote.\n\nIf it works as intended, then it's possible the Republican incumbent with the most first-place votes could end up losing to a Democrat.\n\nSome expect a lawsuit to challenge the one-person, one-vote rule under the theory that the system lets the supporter of a last-place candidate to effectively vote twice, violating the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nThe Maine GOP and Poliquin already have complained about unlocked ballot boxes and other irregularities, furthering speculation of a legal challenge. Poliquin has declined to say if he'll sue if he loses the ranked-choice election. Golden also declined to comment on the voting process.\n\nRob Richie, of FairVote, an organization that's pressing for ranked voting nationwide, dismissed murmurs of possible lawsuits as \"sore loser talk.\"\n\nSeveral courts, including the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, have upheld the constitutionality of ranked-choice voting, he said.\n\nEven though legal precedents favor ranked-choice voting in federal elections in Maine, a lawsuit is certainly possible given the high stakes, said James Monteleone, attorney for the Committee for Ranked Choice Voting in Maine.\n\n\"When political candidates find themselves in a difficult situation, creative lawyers come up with creative ideas,\" he said.\n\nIf there is a lawsuit, it would likely be in federal court in Maine, said Jim Burke, a professor from the University of Maine School of Law.\n\nFor now, the voting system is used only in federal races and in statewide primary elections in Maine. It cannot be used in the governor's race or legislative races because of concerns it runs afoul of the Maine Constitution.\n\nDemocratic Gov.-elect Janet Mills said she intends to press for an amendment to the Maine Constitution so the system can be used in all elections.

He said he gave investigators two computers, a cell phone and access to his email accounts and tweets.\n\nBut he said talks with investigators recently had \"blown up.\"\n\n\"I fully anticipate that in the next few days, I will be indicted by Mueller,\" he said, as he made a pitch for donations to his legal defense fund.\n\nStone, who has also said he expects to be indicted, has denied being a conduit for WikiLeaks, which published thousands of emails stolen from Podesta in the weeks before the election.\n\nIn a telephone interview with the AP last month, Stone said: \"I had no advanced notice of the source or content or the exact timing of the release of the WikiLeaks disclosures.\"", "President Trump is reportedly looking for a new homeland security secretary, according to the Washington Post. An administration official told CBS News Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is expected to leave by the end of the year.\n\nAccording to an administration official, the president has been frustrated by what he views as Nielsen's lackluster performance on immigration enforcement. But Mr. Trump has so far listened to Chief of Staff John Kelly about giving Nielsen more time.\n\nIn a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said Nielsen, who has been at the job for less than a year, \"is committed to implementing the president's security-focused agenda and will continue to do so.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Nielsen defended the administration's policy of separating children from their parents as the enforcement of the laws on the books even though the separation of families is actually an outcome of the Trump administration's increased prosecution of undocumented migrants under Attorney General Jeff Sessions' \"zero-tolerance policy.\"\n\nOver at the Justice Department, where President Trump recently fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions even though he was quite effective on immigration enforcement, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is consulting with senior ethics officials about matters that may require his recusal, which include Robert Mueller's investigation. But there is no legal requirement for Whitaker to follow their advice. These are the same officials who advised Sessions to step aside.\n\nPresident Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, was also in Washington Monday, to meet with Mueller's investigators \u2013 one month ahead of his sentencing date \u2013 as part of his continued cooperation with the DOJ. According to multiple sources, new indictments in the Russia investigation could be coming as soon as Tuesday.", "JERUSALEM -- Hamas and other Gaza militant groups said Tuesday they have accepted an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire after launching hundreds of rockets into Israel over the past 24 hours and weathering a wave of punishing Israeli airstrikes. There was no immediate word from Israel on whether it had accepted a deal to halt the heaviest exchange of fire with Gaza's Hamas rulers since a 2014 war.\n\nThe cease-fire was announced by a group of Gaza militant groups, including Hamas, whose leader Ismail Haniyeh earlier signaled a readiness to halt the latest round of fighting. He said the Islamic militant group would stop its rocket fire if Israel halts its airstrikes.\n\nThe terms of the deal appeared to be modest. Daoud Shehab, a spokesman for the Islamic Jihad militant group, said each side would promise quiet in exchange for quiet.\n\nJust an hour before the militants made their declaration, the Israeli Security Cabinet said it had ordered the military to \"continue operations as needed,\" following a six-hour meeting.\n\nHow this wave of violence started\n\nThe rocket fire was triggered by a botched Israeli military raid in Gaza on Sunday. Undercover troops, apparently on a reconnaissance mission, were discovered inside Gaza, setting off a battle that left seven militants, including a Hamas commander, and a senior Israeli military officer dead. Hamas then fired a guided missile that struck a bus from which soldiers had just disembarked, marking an upgrade over its typical inaccurate projectiles.\n\nThe strike set the bus on fire. A 19-year-old soldier was critically wounded and rocket attacks and Israeli retaliation fire quickly ensued.\n\nThe Israeli military said some 460 rockets and mortar rounds have been launched from Gaza since Monday afternoon, with more than 100 of them intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defense system.\n\nLt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said Israeli warplanes, tanks and naval vessels were involved in strikes against military compounds, observation posts and weapons facilities belonging to the two main Gaza militant groups behind the attacks -- Hamas and the Islamic Jihad. He said the Israeli military has enhanced its deployment along the border but had yet to mobilize its reserves. He said Gaza militant groups were believed to have an arsenal in excess of 20,000 rockets and mortars of different caliber and range.\n\n\"Southern Israel is under attack,\" Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nachshon said Tuesday. \"In the last 24 hours more than 400 mortars and rockets were shot at Israeli cities and villages with deadly consequences. Hamas is deliberately targeting our civilian population and this is something that we cannot and will not accept. The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) will strike in a strong and deadly manner in order to make sure that the message passes across and that Hamas understands that it must stop immediately with those attacks.\"\n\nCBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata said Palestinians in Gaza awoke on Tuesday to widespread destruction from Israeli airstrikes and tank fire. The Israeli forces' targets included a television and radio station run by Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules the territory, and the group's military intelligence headquarters.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gaza's Health Ministry said three Palestinians in their 20s were killed in separate airstrikes, raising the number killed since the Israeli offensive began to seven, including five militants. At least 25 people have been wounded.\n\nIsraeli medical officials said a 48-year-old man was found early Tuesday under the rubble of a building hit by a rocket in the southern city of Ashkelon. Relatives in the West Bank town of Halhoul identified the man as Mahmoud Abu Asbeh, a Palestinian laborer who had been working in Israel. He left a wife and six children behind.\n\n\"Everyone in town is sad. It's God's will and there's nothing we can do about it,\" said his cousin, Jihad Abu Asbeh.\n\nNearly 30 people have been wounded in Israel, three critically, according to medical officials.\n\nGetty\n\nThe last Gaza war, and the lingering blockade\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the armed wing of Hamas threatened to step up its attacks and fire rockets further north toward the Israeli cities of Ashdod and Beersheba if Israel continued its airstrikes. Over the past few months, the sides have come close to a major escalation several times, only to step back in favor of giving a chance to a long-term Egyptian mediated truce.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have fought three wars since the Islamic militant group seized control of Gaza from the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. In the most recent war, over 2,200 Palestinians were killed, more than half of them civilians, and tens of thousands were left homeless. Seventy-three people, most of them soldiers, were killed on the Israeli side.\n\nIsrael and Egypt have maintained a blockade on Gaza since the Hamas takeover. The blockade has devastated Gaza's economy.\n\nIn recent weeks, Egyptian and U.N. mediators had appeared to make progress in brokering informal understandings aimed at quieting the situation.\n\nLast week, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million to Gaza to allow cash-strapped Hamas to pay the salaries of thousands of government workers. At the same time, Hamas has lowered the intensity of its border protests in recent weeks.\n\nNetanyahu cut short a visit to Paris because of the flare-up and returned to Israel on Monday for consultations with top security officials.", "", "", "", "ROSEVILLE, Calif. \u2014 Call it a silver, or a white, lining to such massive devastation.
