'At the same time, we don\u2019t want to be a doormat and just lie down.'\n\nWhite House correspondents and media outlets widely view the Trump administration\u2019s decision to pull CNN reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass as an assault on the free press.\n\nThey also agree that it\u2019s a trap.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd it's one particularly well set by a president seeking to escalate his feud with the media \u2014 and fully aware that the reporter he\u2019s sprung it on, Acosta, has a showy, aggressive style that is divisive among his peers.\n\nWhat\u2019s not clear is what the White House press corps will do in response. Some on Twitter have called for a mass walkout or some other protest at the next media event, while Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote Thursday that CNN should sue the White House. But many reporters fear that such bold action would only give President Donald Trump the fight with the press that he and his base crave.\n\nMorning Media Your guide to the media circus \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

The only agreement so far, the reporter said, is that \u201cthis is unacceptable.\u201d\n\n\"I don't know what the next steps are or should be,\" NBC News chief White House correspondent Hallie Jackson said in a tweet Wednesday night that captured the dilemma. \"But I do know that the @whca and White House press corps \u2014 of which I'm a proud member \u2014 should stand up against this.\u201d\n\nThere has been some action, albeit behind the scenes: White House Correspondents\u2019 Association officials met with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Thursday. And New York Times Washington bureau chief Elisabeth Bumiller circulated an email earlier in the day to several top D.C. media figures, gauging interest in arranging a meeting with the White House to discuss the issue. That type of discreet background lobbying currently seems like the most likely response from a press corps that wants to avoid a public brawl but also feels it cannot let a true offense slide.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to give him ammunition,\u201d one White House reporter said of the president. \u201cAt the same time, we don\u2019t want to be a doormat and just lie down \u2026 Part of it is doing it in a way that doesn\u2019t feed into the narrative that the media is the enemy, and that\u2019s real hard to do.\u201d\n\nThe reporter said the issue had been discussed at his outlet, but people were wary of taking Trump\u2019s bait. \u201cThat\u2019s one reason we\u2019ve decided to keep a low profile,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cI think we would prefer to litigate this quietly behind the scenes with Sarah.\u201d\n\nTensions between the White House and its press corps, always high in this administration, spiked Wednesday night when Sanders accused Acosta of \u201cplacing his hands on\u201d a White House intern when she reached for his microphone at a presidential press conference earlier in the day. Video of the incident showed the contact between the two was much less dramatic. Sanders later posted a video that appeared to many to have been doctored to make Acosta appear more aggressive.\n\nThe \"hard pass\" Acosta held makes it easier for reporters to quickly enter and exit the White House complex. Those who don't have the permanent badge can still get permission to enter, but the process can be cumbersome. It was not clear how long the White House planned to withhold Acosta's pass or whether it would issue him daily passes.\n\nThe WHCA and CNN issued statements Tuesday night decrying the White House's decision, as did numerous reporters and editors. But some reporters said the White House likely felt more emboldened to go after Acosta because his style turns off many of his press corps colleagues. Acosta\u2019s profile has risen as he\u2019s beefed frequently with Trump and Sanders and become, in return, their favorite target.\n\n\u201cThey are going after him because they know he\u2019s a divisive figure among White House reporters,\u201d one member of the press corps said, adding, \u201cSarah and POTUS want this fight more than anything.\u201d\n\nOne administration official said the White House was unified against Acosta and not worried about whether the video Sanders posted was doctored. The official described Acosta as a lightning-rod figure with the public, saying, \u201cDefend his conduct at your own peril.\u201d\n\nMultiple reporters said the press corps needed to defend Acosta on principle \u2014 as one said, \u201cYou have to defend him because they could do it to anyone.\u201d But they also agreed that it would have been easier to unite behind a less combative reporter.\n\n\u201cHe has a way of getting under Trump\u2019s skin, and he knows how to exploit that,\u201d said one reporter who is against any sort of walkout or protest. \u201cIt\u2019s important, I think, for all White House reporters to be at their most professional in this administration.\u201d\n\nThe reporter made clear, however, that nothing Acosta did Wednesday justifies pulling his pass. Some other reporters expressed additional outrage because the hard pass is a security tool used by the Secret Service to regulate access to the White House compound and is not supposed to be used as some sort of bartering chip.\n\nAs Times White House reporter Julie Davis tweeted on Thursday, \u201c@Acosta's behavior here, like it or not, does not disqualify him from the First Amendment-protected freedom to ask questions. Otherwise, how are we different from a place that has no freedom of the press at all?\u201d\n\nDavis\u2018 Times colleague Maggie Haberman added, \u201cAs Julie says, people can disagree with how he handled himself, and many do, but the White House has now unilaterally decided a reporter they don't like can't come into a government building, while sending around a misleading video about him, because it will please Trump.\u201d\n\nTo date, press corps shows of solidarity have mostly consisted of reporters pitching questions back to each other if Sanders or another administration official cuts off a correspondent. In Tuesday\u2019s press conference, NBC News\u2019 Peter Alexander defended Acosta\u2019s character after Trump insulted him.\n\nIn February 2017, some news outlets skipped a briefing in then-press secretary Sean Spicer\u2019s office after others were barred. And there was widespread outrage in July when the White House barred CNN reporter Kaitlan Collins from covering an event after it took issue with questions she asked during an Oval Office photo op, but her credentials were not revoked and the incident passed.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump also pulled reporters\u2019 press access, including those from The New York Times, Washington Post, BuzzFeed and POLITICO. He could do the same on his next campaign \u2014 and, more gravely, continue the practice in the White House.\n\n\u201cRegardless of how we feel about Jim,\u201d another reporter said, \u201cWhite House reporters should be alarmed that the White House is lying about what he did and using what looks like doctored video.\u201d\n\nThe reporter added, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to encourage solidarity inside this group \u2014 and our competitiveness is something the White House exploits on a daily basis \u2014 but I think it\u2019s going to be necessary.\u201d\n\nAnnie Karni contributed to this report.\n\n", "House Democrats' possible decision to join the lawsuit would force an early vote that puts the chamber's Republicans on record about Obamacare and protecting its popular preexisting condition protections. | Aaron P.

He has yet made no such announcements, though, and he said Wednesday on Twitter that he \"look[s] forward to working\" with newly elected members of Congress.\n\nSpokespeople for the Interior Department did not immediately reply to questions from POLITICO. But Interior's press office went on Twitter to dismiss the possibility of Zinke joining Fox, writing: \"It's laughably false and belongs in The Onion.\"\n\nA contract with Fox would be unlikely unless Trump asks Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul who owns the company, one source told POLITICO. There is no indication the network has responded positively to Zinke\u2019s overtures or expressed interest in bringing him on board.\n\nThe secretary, whose job includes oversight of vast stretches of the nation's energy and mineral wealth, has faced increasing questions about his future as investigations have intensified into his use of taxpayer's money, handling of a proposed Connecticut gambling casino and relations with the industries he regulates. Those include a probe of a land development project in Zinke's hometown of Whitefish, Mont., that is backed by the chairman of the giant energy company Halliburton, which POLITICO first reported in June.\n\nInterior's inspector general's office has referred at least one of its probes to the Justice Department, which could decide whether to pursue its own investigation or weigh criminal charges, according to multiple news reports.\n\nExpectations of his departure mark a significant change in fortunes for Zinke, who has enjoyed what one former White House official calls Trump's affection for his bluntness and charisma. Just months ago, Zinke even offered himself as a possible replacement for another embattled Cabinet member, then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, the former White House official told POLITICO this week.\n\nTrump has praised Zinke's work at Interior but said this week that he plans to look at the investigations \u2014 and hinted Wednesday that a decision could come soon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at that, and I do want to study whatever is being said,\u201d Trump said during a news conference at the White House. \"I think he\u2019s doing an excellent job, but we will take a look at that, and we\u2019ll probably have an idea on that in about a week.\u201d\n\nShould Zinke be in job talks with an industry he regulates, such as oil and gas, he may run into trouble with federal ethics laws, an attorney at the watchdog group Campaign Legal Center said Thursday.\n\nAccording to federal statute, Zinke must recuse himself from any decisions at Interior that could affect the business of any company he is seeking employment with, said Delaney Marsco, the group's ethics counsel. The group is considering filing a complaint on the matter, Marsco said.\n\n\u201cThese recusal obligations apply regardless of whether the communications are indirect, and even if Zinke isn\u2019t serious about the job and never takes it,\u201d Marsco told POLITICO.\n\nZinke has also had designs on higher office. He was widely seen as a likely challenger this year for Democratic Montana Sen. Jon Tester until Trump picked him for Interior secretary \u2014 a process that the president's son Donald Trump Jr. played a role in. And Zinke may eventually decide to try his hand in the Montana governor\u2019s race in 2020, though he would probably face stiff competition in the Republican primary, political consultants in the state have said.\n\nBesides Zinke, Republicans believed to be interested in the 2020 race include Montana Rep. Greg Gianforte, state Attorney General Tim Fox, Secretary of State Corey Stapleton and state auditor Matt Rosendale, who narrowly lost a challenge to Tester this week.\n\nZinke may face a new challenge if he tries to run in his old state: As Interior secretary, he has shrunk the boundaries of several national monuments that protect swaths of western land from uses like drilling and mining. That helped advance Trump's energy policies but has been unpopular with Montanans, analysts in the state have said.\n\n\u201cI imagine he'll face a crowded primary if he does [run], and I don't think he'd be guaranteed the nomination by any means,\u201d said Brandon DeMars, senior associate at Montana-based political consultancy Hilltop Public Solutions.\n\nZinke\u2019s outreach to private equity would have followed a meeting he had with financiers last year in New York City. During an official trip in early September 2017, he was scheduled to meet with representatives of private equity firms Cornell Capital and Harvest Capital; hedge fund Kore Capital; Ken Pontarelli, a Goldman Sachs alumnus specializing in energy companies; and Brian O'Callaghan, head of the Wall Street headhunting firm CPI, according to documents released to the Sierra Club under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nZinke\u2019s official calendar shows he was in New York City at the time the meeting was scheduled to take place, but offers no details on his activities on those days except that he visited Fox Studios NYC.\n\nInterior\u2019s inspector general opened an investigation in July into the Montana land deal, which involves a proposal backed by Halliburton Chairman David Lesar to build a hotel, retail shops, a microbrewery and other amenities near the center of Whitefish, a popular resort area. The project is near land that Zinke and his wife, Lola, own through various LLCs, as well as a 14-acre plot owned by a foundation Ryan Zinke created.\n\nLola Zinke gave the Lesar-backed development a crucial assist by agreeing in writing to let the developer use some of the foundation\u2019s land for a parking lot, POLITICO reported in June. The developer has suggested that Ryan and Lola Zinke would get to own and operate the microbrewery, Whitefish city planner David Taylor told POLITICO.\n\nBefore the parking lot agreement was signed, Ryan Zinke met at Interior Department headquarters with Lesar and the other developers and discussed the project with them over dinner, POLITICO reported.\n\nZinke has dismissed POLITICO\u2019s reporting as \u201cfake news,\u201d and his attorney said last week that the \u201cSecretary has done nothing wrong.\u201d\n\n\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Fox News' parent company.", "Sens.

The trips give him more time to bounce ideas off outside allies and friends without the regimentation of even his loose daily White House schedule, which he increasingly bristles against.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut White House aides and outside advisers acknowledge privately that Trump is often more impulsive when he\u2019s on the road and out of sight of senior staffers.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s more free and liberated there.

Mar-a-Lago members have reportedly helped orchestrate key policy decisions, such as how to run the Veterans Affairs Department. The president also announced an April 2017 missile strike on Syria from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump\u2019s out-of-office jaunts come at a precarious moment for the White House. Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation is expected to again take center stage after going publicly quiet during the midterms, a development that is certain to infuriate the president. Trump already seemed to be returning his attention to Mueller on Wednesday, tweeting about him for the first time since mid-September.\n\nTrump also on Wednesday finally ousted Sessions after grousing about him publicly and privately for months for recusing himself from the Mueller probe. Trump\u2019s choice to serve as acting attorney general \u2014 Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker \u2014 is now overseeing the investigation. Whitaker wrote a CNN op-ed last year calling on the Justice Department to limit the scope of the probe, causing immediate concern on Capitol Hill that Trump was taking steps to rein in Mueller\u2019s work \u2014 long seen as a red line the president could not cross.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is also poised to soon make crucial decisions that will shape his next two years in office, from staffing to his legislative agenda to his response to the Democratic takeover of the House.\n\nNervous aides have long been anticipating a post-midterms staff shake-up , both at the White House and at the Cabinet level. Some of the personnel changes will be voluntary: Several senior White House aides are eyeing the exits or making plans to move to Trump\u2019s reelection campaign. But others will likely come at the president\u2019s urging. Trump is weighing the future of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, whose ethics problems have annoyed many White House aides.\n\nA White House official said it remained unclear what Trump would decide when it comes to personnel shifts, but added that there have been frequent conversations in the West Wing in recent weeks about who is coming and going.\n\nTrump has also telegraphed his desire for a fight with the Democrats \u2014 who will soon control the House after Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections \u2014 despite his stated willingness to cooperate on bipartisan legislation on issues like infrastructure and the economy. Allies said Trump is increasingly viewing his decisions in raw political terms with an eye toward his own reelection bid in 2020.\n\nIndeed, even as he said during a lengthy news conference on Wednesday that it\u2019s \u201ctime to put partisanship aside,\u201d Trump openly weighed the political ramifications of the midterms power shift. Pondering the possible benefits of a war between the newly empowered House Democrats and the White House, Trump quipped, \u201cI could see it being extremely good [for me] politically, because I think I'm better at that game than they are.\"\n\nWhite House aides and outside advisers long ago gave up on trying to control the president, who has now scheduled large blocks of so-called executive time for himself in which he watches cable news and makes phone calls \u2014 mimicking the conditions of his trips to Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to do what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d another former White House official said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost not even worth fretting about something that you have no control over. You cannot micromanage Trump.\u201d\n\nAs he neared the end of his second year as president, Trump has also become more confident in his gut instincts, aides and others close to him said, making him much more likely to ignore the advice or warnings or staffers \u2014 no matter where he is.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if staff are irrelevant, but especially now, staff just kind of follow the president\u2019s lead,\u201d the first former White House official said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d expect that to continue regardless of who leaves and who stays.\u201d", "Challenges to Robert Mueller\u2019s authority to date have gone nowhere. | Andrew Harnik, File/AP Photo Legal Mueller power questioned in first post-Sessions court hearing Legal experts have serious doubts the case will shut down Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\nA drive to derail special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into the Trump campaign was taken up by a powerful federal appeals court Thursday as a three-judge panel heard arguments that the special prosecutor\u2019s appointment last year was legally flawed and unconstitutional.\n\nThe judges heard an appeal from a former aide to Trump adviser Roger Stone, Andrew Miller, who resisted a grand jury subpoena in order to create a legal vehicle to challenge Mueller\u2019s authority to continue his year-and-a-half long probe into alleged collusion between the Trump political operation and Russia during the 2016 presidential race.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe arguments Thursday marked the first public outing for members of the special counsel\u2019s team since Democrats won future control of the House in the November midterms and Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions and gave the investigators a new boss: acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker.\n\nBefore the lawyers said a word, the senior member of the panel, Judge Karen Henderson, said the judges had decided to set aside Sessions\u2019 departure \u2014 for now.\n\n\u201cArgue this case as if it was being argued yesterday morning,\u201d said Henderson, an appointee of President George H.W.

He\u2019s like a U.S. attorney at large.\u201d\n\nKamenar\u2019s argument focused largely on the regulations under which Mueller was appointed. Miller\u2019s attorney complained that they appear to give a special counsel \u201cfree rein\u201d about how to conduct his probe.\n\n\u201cHe can indict without consulting the acting attorney general,\u201d Kamenar said.\n\nDeputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben, who represents Mueller\u2019s office, told the appeals court that Kamenar was wrong to suggest that Mueller can essentially set his own course and decide when he needs to tell Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \u2014 who had been overseeing the probe before Whitaker's appointment \u2014 about any developments in the probe.\n\n\u201cI think the court may have been given a slightly different impression than the way the regulations actually operate,\u201d Dreeben declared. \u201cWe are therefore required to submit reports to the acting attorney general in accordance with Department of Justice urgent report guidelines. ... Major events in investigations are reported up the chain of command.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe acting attorney general can ask the special counsel for explanation of any investigatory step,\u201d Dreeben added. \u201cHe\u2019s aware of what we\u2019re doing. ... It\u2019s not the case that the special counsel is off wandering in a free-floating environment and can decide when to report.\u201d\n\nJudge Judith Rogers said the regulations may not capture how Mueller\u2019s investigation was being overseen, raising the possibility he was being more closely supervised than the rules may require.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t say under no circumstances shall the deputy attorney general ask for more reporting,\u201d said Rogers, an appointee of President Bill Clinton. \u201cThe way I read the record is we just don\u2019t know what is going on.\u201d\n\nKamenar suggested the appeals court might want to send the case back to a district court judge to explore how tightly Mueller was being supervised.\n\n\u201cMaybe the district court should have a chance to take some record evidence to see the proof in the pudding in terms of supervision [and] what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Miller\u2019s attorneys have signaled they want to see this case taken all the way to the Supreme Court. Trump seemed to give tacit approval to the legal challenge in August when he told Bloomberg News that he viewed Mueller\u2019s operation as unlawful.\n\n\u201cI view it as an illegal investigation,\" he said, alluding to unnamed \"great scholars\" who say that \"there never should have been a special counsel.\u201d\n\nDuring a press conference outside the courthouse, Kamenar said he expected the Supreme Court to rule in Miller\u2019s favor if the case makes it there. \u201cWe believe at that point, with this current bench, that they would find that Mueller is basically acting as a rogue type of a prosecutor,\u201d he said, alluding to the recent confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nBut the road to the Supreme Court is likely to take months. If Miller loses his case before the three-judge panel, Kamenar said he might petition the entire appeals court to rehear the case. That would mean the case wouldn\u2019t reach the Supreme Court until springtime at the earliest, he said.\n\nChallenges to Mueller\u2019s authority to date have gone nowhere. In May, federal judges presiding over separate criminal cases against Paul Manafort in Washington and Alexandria, Va., issued rulings rejecting the former Trump campaign chairman\u2019s bids to toss out the charges by claiming the special counsel\u2019s appointment was flawed.\n\nAnd in August another Washington-based federal judge turned down an attempt by the Russian company Concord Management to challenge Mueller\u2019s jurisdiction after the firm was charged in connection with a Kremlin-linked online troll farm accused of targeting the 2016 American election.\n\nConcord attempted to intervene in Miller\u2019s appeal and also filed an appeal of its own, but later abandoned that. The appeals court turned down Concord\u2019s attempt to join Miller\u2019s appeal, but agreed to allow the Russia-based firm to take part in the case with a friend-of-the-court status.\n\nConcord attorney James Martin said Rosenstein lacked any authority in the law to appoint someone from outside the Justice Department, like Mueller, to serve as a special counsel.\n\nHowever, Judge Sri Srinivasan alluded to the fact that he previously served as deputy solicitor general and no specific law authorizes the hiring of someone to serve in that capacity.\n\n\u201cThere is no statute that provides for a deputy solicitor general,\u201d noted Srinivasan, an appointee of President Barack Obama.\n\nKamenar, Miller's attorney, picked up on this theme Thursday, arguing Sessions should have appointed the special counsel even though he was recused from the case.\n\n\"He cannot recuse himself from his constitutional duty to appoint the investigators any more than the president can say, \u2018I\u2019m recused from appointing the GSA director because I own property subject to his jurisdiction,\u2019\u201d Miller\u2019s attorney said.\n\nMiller himself, who lives in St. Louis, wasn\u2019t in the courtroom on Friday. Dreeben and another prosecutor working for Mueller, Adam Jed, represented the special counsel. Dreeben appeared relaxed after he concluded his argument, leaning over to whisper something in Jed\u2019s ear as he raised his eyebrows and smiled.\n\nLegal experts have their doubts that Thursday\u2019s case will shut down Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\n\u201cI think just like every one of these arguments that\u2019s been made it\u2019s going to fail,\u201d Dan Goldman, a former federal prosecutor who attended the Manafort trial as an MSNBC contributor, told POLITICO. \u201cI see this as a dead loser for Miller.\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s attorneys have also predicted they expect to lose the round in front of the D.C. Circuit.\n\n\u201cThat court is populated with a lot more liberal Obama appointed judges,\u201d Kamenar said last month during an appearance on a radio show hosted by Michael Caputo, a former Trump aide who has also been questioned in the Russia probe.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether I will win in that court. Quite frankly, I\u2019m not expecting to,\u201d Kamenar added.\n\nHe said as much again after arguments on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s gonna be hard to get two [of the three] judges ruling in our favor based on the way the arguments\u201d went, Kamenar said. \u201cBut you never know.\u201d\n\nMueller\u2019s interest in Miller stems from the wider probe into Roger Stone, the longtime Trump associate who has said he\u2019s preparing for a federal indictment.\n\nAbout a dozen Stone associates have been questioned to date in the special counsel investigation, including Sam Nunberg and Kristin Davis, the former prostitution ring manager known as the \u201cManhattan Madam.\u201d\n\nCaputo, who also has been interviewed in the Mueller probe and by congressional investigators, said last month during the radio show that he\u2019s long known Miller and his family and helped connect the Stone aide with his attorneys for the constitutional challenge.\n\nThis article tagged under: Robert Mueller\n\nMueller Investigation", "This weekend, Rep.

In a related filing, the Justice Department said the justices should intervene in order to ensure an \u201cappropriately prompt resolution\u201c in the litigation.\n\nThe 9th Circuit decision preserves the status quo for the moment and will require the administration to continue accepting DACA renewal applications.\n\nThe panel \u2014 composed of two appointees of former President Barack Obama and one of former President Bill Clinton \u2014 found the decision to end DACA was based \u201csolely on a misconceived view of the law\u201c and therefore subject to review by federal courts.\n\n\u201cThe executive wields awesome power in the enforcement of our nation\u2019s immigration laws,\u201d the ruling reads. \u201cOur decision today does not curb that power, but rather enables its exercise in a manner that is free from legal misconceptions and is democratically accountable to the public.\u201d\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Judge John Owens disagreed that the DACA termination was reviewable as an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201c executive decision. However, he found plaintiffs reasonably alleged the rescission was motivated by racial animus, which warranted a freeze on the termination.\n\n\u201cA merits decision from the district court concluding that the executive rescinded DACA because of unconstitutional racial animus would be little more than an advisory opinion if by that time thousands of young people had lost their status due to the lack of an injunction preserving it,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDuring oral arguments before the 9th Circuit in May, Owens repeatedly raised questions about the possible role of racial bias in the decision to end the program.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra, whose state is a party in one of the lawsuits affected by the decision, called the ruling \u201ca tremendous victory\u201c for the program\u2019s enrollees.\n\nTrump announced in September 2017 that he would end DACA, and the Homeland Security Department stopped accepting renewal requests the following month. But in January, U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup ordered the administration to restart renewals, arguing that Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 conclusion that the program was illegal appeared to be \"based on a flawed legal premise.\"\n\nA Brooklyn-based federal judge followed suit in February and also ruled to halt the planned termination. Washington, D.C.-based U.S. District Court Judge John Bates then took a step further and ordered a full restart of the program \u2014 but immediately put that ruling on hold pending appeal.\n\nNot all DACA lawsuits have sought to end the program. Texas and six other states sued the Trump administration in May to shut DACA down, arguing that DACA overstepped the authority of the executive branch \u2014 the same argument that sunk a separate Obama deportation relief program created in 2014.\n\nBrownsville-based U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen, the same judge who ruled against the 2014 program,declined to issue an emergency injunction against the program in August, while signaling that he will likely move to block DACA later. Should that occur, the question of whether the Trump administration must preserve DACA or end it will almost certainly end up before the Supreme Court.", "Sen.

They are still counting in Broward County.\u201d\n\nAnother problem with Broward: about 24,000 more people voted for governor than for U.S. Senate \u2013 even though the Senate race was at the top of the ballot and top-of-the-ballot races usually rack up the most votes. More Broward voters cast ballots in the state\u2019s agriculture commissioner, chief financial officer and attorney general races as well \u2013 a phenomenon seen in none of the other 66 counties.\n\nElections experts suspect that poor ballot design may have contributed to Broward undervoting the Senate race in such large numbers.\n\nElias, however, said Nelson isn\u2019t challenging ballot design. Instead, he said Nelson\u2019s team believes that the optical-scan machines didn\u2019t pick up poorly marked ballots. If the ballots are re-scanned, Elias believes the chances of the votes being recorded increases.\n\nIn a Thursday morning conference call, Elias told reporters that because the problems are focused largely on Broward County, and to some extent Palm Beach County \u2013 both Democratic strongholds \u2013 Nelson will continue to eat into Scott\u2019s lead, and it will be a \u201cjump ball\u201d as far as who is winning when the recount officially begins on Saturday.\n\nOne reason Broward is still uploading ballots is due to its sheer size. It has about 1.2 million registered voters and received 16,855 vote-by-mail absentee ballots on Election Day, 7,600 of them the day before and had to handle a crush of voters. Before the absentee ballots can be tallied, Florida law ensures that Florida elections officials in each county review voter signatures on the ballots to make sure they match a signature on file.\n\n\u201cYou want to make sure these ballots are legitimate so there\u2019s no voter fraud. It takes time,\u201d said Daniel A. Smith, a University of Florida political science professor who estimated that 125,000 absentee ballots were received statewide on Election Day alone.\n\nIn Broward, 52 percent of the ballots were cast by Democrats, Smith said.\n\nStill, the largest county in Florida, Miami-Dade, finished all of its uploading and tallying of absentee ballots on Wednesday, according to a spokeswoman for the local elections office. All counties are now reviewing provisional ballots, cast when a voter\u2019s eligibility is in dispute. The deadline for voters to prove their provisional ballot should count is at 5 p.m. Thursday.\n\nIn an extra twist, a teacher at Miramar Elementary School in the county, Lakeisha Sorey, said she noticed in the old cafeteria of the school that Broward elections workers left behind a box labeled \u201cPROVISIONAL BALLOT BOX.\u201d Sorey, who sent pictures of the box to POLITICO, said she alerted her principal, didn\u2019t know whether it contained ballots and didn\u2019t touch it because \u201cI don\u2019t want anybody to say I tampered with anything. But I want to make sure that if there are votes in there that they\u2019re counted. ... It makes me question everything that\u2019s going on \u2014 just the fact that I want everyone\u2019s vote to be counted\u201d\n\nThough there are no concrete figures regarding ballots left to be counted statewide, there are some clues that indicate tens of thousands could be left.\n\nIn Broward County, for instance, in the state agriculture commissioner race, which is the second statewide race already under recount, there are 23,000 vote-by-mail ballots reported to the state versus those counted. In that race, Fried pulled ahead of Caldwell Thursday afternoon after trailing him by only 4,094 votes hours before, which means it\u2019s within the state\u2019s 0.25 percentage point margin to force a hand recount.\n\nSo far, the U.S. Senate is headed for a machine recount, which is triggered when the margin in a race hits 0.5 percentage points. On Thursday, the gubernatorial race fell just below the threshold when the margin hit 0.47 points.\n\nThe races are tightening as Broward loads in more and more votes, putting the county in the spotlight and the crosshairs of Republicans.\n\n\u201cIf the office doesn\u2019t know how many ballots there are left to count, then it raises serious questions about the integrity of the entire process,\u201d said Leonard Collins, an attorney who successfully sued Snipes\u2019 office for its unlawful destruction of ballot that candidate Tim Canova wanted to review after his unsuccessful 2016 Democratic primary against U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\n\u201cThere should at least be an inventory of the ballots left to be counted and it should be public. But there\u2019s not any of this,\u201d Collins said, declining to comment on whether he is among the groups of elections lawyers who will be drafted into what\u2019s likely to be a looming court battle.\n\nBroward\u2019s office has periodically been bedeviled by controversies and mishaps since the 2000 presidential elections, where thousands of punch-card ballots were being reviewed before the recount was shut down by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nA photo of a man using a magnifying class to examine voter intent on a Broward County punch-card ballot became the iconic picture commemorating the fiasco.\n\nIn 2003, after the office mismanaged the 2002 Democratic primary for governor, Snipes\u2019 predecessor, Miriam Oliphant, was removed from office a by then-Gov. Jeb Bush, who appointed Snipes. She was subsequently reelected.\n\nBefore the 2016 elections, Snipes\u2019 office mistakenly sent out some absentee ballots to voters that failed to list a popular medical marijuana measure that ultimately passed by wide margins, but not before the office was sued by the Florida chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. In another case during the election, the office mailed out about 1,700 ballots that had the word \u201cno\u201d in Creole where it should have said \u201cwi\u201d for \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nRight before the 2016 elections, the Republican Party of Florida threatened to sue Snipes for the way in which her office handled the opening of absentee ballots. The controversy initially went away, but the party then sued to ensure her office followed the law on handling the ballots. It ultimately prevailed in court.\n\nSnipes was hauled into court in a federal lawsuit over the way her office removes ineligible voters from the rolls, but she prevailed. However, she did lose yet another suit that was filed in the Wasserman Schultz race over the destruction of ballots after the election.\n\nFlorida\u2019s elections division announced it would monitor her office heading into the election.\n\nIn talking to reporters, Nelson\u2019s lawyer, Elias, stopped short of criticizing Snipes and instead focused on the recount ahead.\n\nElias said he is not sure if Nelson will be ahead of Scott, but he predicts things will tighten further before the process officially beings. He has been the lead attorney on dozens of post-election disputes and told reporters sometimes he tells clients that the race might be close, but they still likely will not win.\n\n\u201cThat is not the conversation I\u2019ve had with Sen. Nelson,\u201d Elias said, expressing his confidence in a forthcoming Nelson victory.\n\nAt this point, Elias said the campaign thinks there was a large undervote in Broward County, or voters casting ballots that indicated they voted in other races but not the Senate race. As evidence, he points to the fact that nearly 14,000 more people in Broward County voted in the attorney general\u2019s race than U.S. Senate race. The U.S. Senate race was a much more high-profile race, with candidates known statewide and tons more advertising, which makes fewer people voting in that race notable.\n\n\u201cThat, frankly, is not plausible,\u201d Elias said.", "President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has argued that as long as some part of the DNC emails dumped into the public sphere were newsworthy, publication of the entire raft is protected by the First Amendment, but lawyers for the Trump critics say that\u2019s incorrect. | Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Legal Trump critics fight bid to dismiss suit over DNC hacking\n\nLawyers for critics suing President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign over its alleged involvement in the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails urged a federal judge in Virginia Thursday to reject a bid by the campaign to have the lawsuit thrown out.\n\nThe Trump campaign met the suit earlier this year with an eyebrow-raising claim: that Trump\u2019s presidential bid had the legal right under the First Amendment to disseminate emails that were stolen by others.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHowever, attorneys pressing the case argued in a new brief filed Thursday that the Trump campaign\u2019s assertions about First Amendment protections are a diversion because its alleged involvement in the hacking and the dissemination of private information about Democratic donors went well beyond anything permitted by law.\n\n\u201cAs the publicly known evidence of a conspiracy has become overwhelming, the Campaign has pivoted from denying coordination with the Kremlin to claiming that such collusion is not a crime,\u201d lawyers with the Trump-focused watchdog group United to Protect Democracy wrote on behalf of the plaintiffs, who contend they were harmed by publication of their social security numbers, medical information and details of private interactions with co-workers.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has argued that as long as some part of the DNC emails dumped into the public sphere were newsworthy, publication of the entire raft is protected by the First Amendment, but lawyers for the Trump critics say that\u2019s incorrect.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

The new case repeatedly accuses the Florida-based Stone of illegal conduct but does not name him as a defendant.\n\nStone\u2019s interactions with WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange have been the subject of extensive and ongoing investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller.

Jeff Sessions was ousted as attorney general, a move long in the making, and he's not likely to be the last, with both Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on thin ice. Although President Donald Trump said Wednesday he was \"very happy\" with his administration, he also repeated that he was \"looking at\" allegations that Zinke violated ethics rules and would \"probably have an idea on that in about a week.\"\n\nWeighing in: Zinke's not showing any sign that he plans to depart the agency any time soon: He tweeted congrats to new lawmakers elected to Congress and said he looks \"forward to working with all of you to advance important @Interior priorities.\"\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis are pictured. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nWho's the new DOJ guy? Matthew Whitaker will take on the job as acting attorney general following Sessions' departure. Already Whitaker has come under fire for his previous criticism of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Trump, but he's also been a critic of the \"environmental left\" during his time as executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust. In 2016, Whitaker penned an op-ed on Morning Consult blasting the attorneys general investigating Exxon Mobil's climate change activities for launching an \"unconstitutional and unethical\" probe, and asserting that they bullied opponents in an attempt to silence them.\n\nAnother thing: With Republicans gains in the Senate, expect a flurry of Trump's Cabinet and judicial nominations to move ahead in the coming months, POLITICO's Gabby Orr and Daniel Lippman report. On that list could be EPA acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler, whom the president has teased he might nominate for the spot permanently and who would face a friendlier hearing with the new Senate GOP majority.\n\nIT'S THURSDAY!

Jared Polis and Michelle Lujan Grisham \u2014 who ran on pledges to expand clean-energy production and crack down on methane emissions from drilling rigs, Pro's Ben Lefebvre reports.\n\n\"There was a blue tsunami in Colorado and New Mexico,\" Western Energy Alliance Director Kathleen Sgamma told ME. \"Democrats took or expanded their hold in both houses of both state legislatures and took hold of all statewide offices. Interestingly, that blue tsunami didn't translate into support for Prop 112 [on drilling setbacks] or other tax increase measures, indicating that it's not a hard-left result in Colorado but rather there are plenty of moderates in the electorate and in office whom industry can work with.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Dan Eberhart, CEO of oilfield services company Canary LLC, shot down the idea that methane emissions regulations are about to get tougher. \"Regs come from the administration and I don't see this administration changing direction on methane, etc,\" he said in a statement to ME. \"Also the results of ballot measures [Tuesday] night showed that voters don't support proposals that increase their energy costs.\"\n\nCome together: The Colorado Oil and Gas Association, which opposed the ballot measure to curb fracking in the state, says it intends to meet with Polis on the issue. \"The Governor-elect has said multiple times that he will honor the will of the voters, so we are hopeful that practical and constructive discussions lie ahead,\" communications director Scott Prestidge said.\n\nAROUND THE AGENCIES\n\nINTERIOR: TRIBE WASTING COURT'S TIME: The Interior Department said Wednesday that the Mashantucket Pequot tribe has not provided enough evidence that political interference led DOI to do anything wrong when it blocked a casino project in Connecticut, Pro's Nick Juliano reports. Interior accused the tribe and the state of Connecticut of wasting the court's time by attempting to introduce new arguments after their first lawsuit was dismissed. \"Here, even accepting the allegations in the proposed amended complaint as true for the limited purpose of this motion, Plaintiffs have not alleged facts sufficient to show that any political influence crossed the line and improperly affected the Secretary's consideration,\" Interior wrote in a motion filed Wednesday.\n\nIn a separate brief, MGM argued that the tribe did not demonstrate that the lobbying against their casino was improper. \"Plaintiffs' threadbare allegations of 'political pressure' do not satisfy that standard and ignore that Plaintiffs themselves enlisted the support of federal, state, and local officials to lobby Interior into approving the amendments,\" MGM wrote.\n\nWHAT CAME FIRST, THE EMAIL OR THE IG? House Natural Resources ranking member Ra\u00fal Grijalva confirmed to Bloomberg on Wednesday that if he becomes chairman of the committee next Congress, he'll launch a probe into the Interior Department's handling of HUD Secretary Ben Carson's announcement that an agency political appointee would become acting inspector general at Interior, which Interior denied days later. \"About a week earlier, the acting inspector general targeted for replacement had referred a Zinke investigation to the Justice Department for a possible criminal probe,\" two people familiar with the action told Bloomberg. The timing \"can't be dismissed as merely a coincidence,\" Grijalva said. \"That's why the oversight is so necessary.\"\n\nCONSERVATIVE GROUP SUES DOE: The conservative group Judicial Watch is suing the Energy Department for failure to respond to FOIA document requests related to Michael Cohen's role in the application for a $5 billion federal loan guarantee for the Bellefonte nuclear power plant.

The Climate Solutions Caucus' loss of a large portion of its Republican ranks on Tuesday was cheered by some greens, who accuse GOP members of using the caucus to \"greenwash\" their poor records fighting climate change. \"I have no idea who will lead the caucus now \u2014 or whether it will simply fade away into the obscurity that it deserves,\" said Climate Hawks Vote President RL Miller in a statement. Miller's group endorsed Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who ultimately beat Republican caucus co-founder Carlos Curbelo on Tuesday.\n\nBut if you ask the Citizens' Climate Lobby, which was instrumental in the original formation of the caucus and plays a key role in putting forth its members, the caucus should live on. \"This is a core of Republicans who can survive election cycles, who are interested in respectful discussions with Democrats on solutions, and they're not going anywhere,\" Danny Richter, head of CCL's government affairs, told ME. \"And I see that as very positive for the climate.\"\n\nRichter wouldn't say who would be best suited to replace Curbelo, but shot back at attacks on the caucus' ability to address climate change. \"When I ask myself, 'Is it more or less likely that we get to something that is big enough to actually solve this \u2014 is it more or less likely we can do something like that when the parties are speaking together in a body that meets regularly and has respectful dialogue or is harder?'\" he said. \"To me it's obvious. It's more likely if those bodies exist that we get something that's a match to the scale of the problem.\" The group is sending more than 600 volunteers to Capitol Hill next week to meet with lawmakers on addressing climate change in the next Congress.\n\nPALLONE'S PRIORITIES: Rep. Frank Pallone pledged to seek investments in clean energy and drinking water infrastructure, and conduct rigorous oversight of the Trump administration, if he gets the gavel of the Energy and Commerce Committee next year as expected, Pro's Anthony Adragna reports. The New Jersey Democrat said he'd ask for support from his colleagues on the committee in his quest for the chairmanship, and said he'd \"follow through on pushing policies that build a stronger economy, create more good-paying jobs and protect consumers from skyrocketing costs that make it increasingly difficult to make ends meet.\"\n\nSCIENCE!

Bloomberg's Ty Richardson flagged on Twitter on Wednesday that Democratic staff of a House committee has already posted a job opening for investigative counsel. \"Responsibilities include drafting letters and subpoenas,\" the post says.\n\nBALLOT BOX\n\nWATER WARS: California voters rejected Proposition 3, the San Francisco Chronicle reports, a ballot measure that would have authorized an $8.9 billion water bond issuance to fund water infrastructure, groundwater and surface water storage, dam repairs and watershed protection. The Sierra Club California opposed the effort, in part because it could \"fund dam projects that are harmful to the environment and [are] strongly opposed by the environmental community.\" But it had support from environmental groups like National Wildlife Federation and Ducks Unlimited, as well as a host of California water districts.\n\nSpeaking of: Republican Rep.

With 100 percent of precincts reporting on election night, Kemp led Abrams 50.3 percent to 48.7 percent. That lead has narrowed as more absentee and provisional ballots have been counted.\n\nKemp's office and the Abrams campaign estimate there are about 25,000 ballots still to be counted, a combination of provisional and absentee votes. A runoff, if it happens, would be on Dec. 4.\n\n\"We know that there are many provisional ballots that will be counted and a vast majority of them will be for Stacey,\" Abrams campaign lawyer John Chandler said. \"We will litigate until every vote has been counted.\"\n\nBoth Abrams' and Kemp's teams have been bracing for the possibility of a runoff.\n\nAbrams, former President Jimmy Carter, and other critics of Kemp argue that he should have stepped down as secretary of state while he was running, to avoid effectively overseeing his own race. In a statement on Thursday, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People President Derrick Johnson said Kemp should have resigned his position earlier.\n\nCritics of Kemp have suggested that Kemp may have been using his role as secretary of state to his advantage during the election.\n\n\"It\u2019s unfortunate that Brian Kemp did not step down months ago as Secretary of State to ensure that Georgia had a fair election. Whether it\u2019s malicious intent or benign neglect, Kemp\u2019s actions during the election were textbook voter suppression and surely decreased voter confidence among residents in the state,\" Johnson said.\n\nKemp's team brushed off the Abrams campaign's accusations as an act of desperation.\n\n\"Stacey Abrams can't accept the fact that Georgians rejected her radical agenda at the ballot box, so now she's desperately trying to steal this election in the courtroom,\" Kemp campaign communications director Ryan Mahoney said. \"After realizing that it was mathematically impossible to win the race with votes outstanding, Abrams' team has decided to file frivolous, politically motivated lawsuits.\"\n\nKemp has denied any conflict of interest but also said that stepping down as secretary of state would give Georgians \"confidence in the certification process,\" according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. That process is expected to conclude by early next week.\n\nOther prominent Democrats have continued to criticize Kemp. In a fundraising email to supporters on Wednesday, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said that Kemp \"clearly abused his position as Georgia's Secretary of State to engage in rampant voter suppression \u2014 creating confusion at the polls and removing more than 1 million voters from the rolls over the past few years.\"\n\nDemocratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez said at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast Thursday that he doesn't consider the Georgia gubernatorial election over. Members of the DNC are on the ground in the state currently helping with ballot counting efforts for the Abrams campaign.\n\nSince Tuesday's election, Abrams' campaign has activated its legal team and a \"provisional ballot chase program\" to make sure that all ballots are counted.

We stand by our statement.\"\n\nPaul Joseph Watson, an alt-right YouTuber with ties to InfoWars, had posted a similar video earlier Wednesday evening. Watson on Thursday denied speeding up the video to make the contact look more aggressive, saying he only zoomed in. He posted a screen shot of the video editing software he said he used, which he said proved the video was not doctored.\n\nBut a side-by-side video comparison by Slate's Aymann Ismail shows Acosta's hand touching the intern slightly faster in the White House version of the video than in a clip posted by NBC, suggesting Acosta's arm was sped up.\n\nAcosta and Trump got into a heated argument during an explosive news briefing Wednesday at which the president berated several members of the press for behaving disrespectfully when they pushed him to answer their questions. Acosta tried to ask Trump a question about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and Trump quickly shot him down, calling him a \"rude, terrible person.\"\n\nA White House intern attempted to pull the microphone away from Acosta as Trump dismissed his question, but Acosta held onto the microphone, pulling it away from the intern.\n\n\"Pardon me, ma'am,\" he said during the increasingly tense moment.\n\nThe White House later revoked Acosta's press pass, with Sanders tweeting he behaved inappropriately by \"placing his hands\" on the intern and by taking too much time from other reporters by pressing the president to answer his questions.\n\n\"President Trump believes in a free press and expects and welcomes tough questions of him and his Administration,\" she wrote. \"We will, however, never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.\"\n\nThe move was quickly criticized by journalists from multiple outlets as censorship. The White House Correspondents' Association released a statement urging the White House to restore Acosta's access.\n\n\"Revoking access to the White House complex is a reaction out of line to the purported offense and is unacceptable,\" the statement said.\n\nCNN anchor Jake Tapper tweeted a statement from Whitney Shefte, president of the White House News Photographers Association, condemning Sanders for posting a possibly altered video.\n\n\u201cAs visual journalists, we know that manipulating images is manipulating truth. It\u2018s deceptive, dangerous and unethical,\u201c the statement said. \u201cKnowingly sharing manipulated images is equally problematic, particularly when the person sharing them is a representative of our country\u2018s highest office with vast influence over public opinion.\u201c\n\nBut the Trump circle continues to place blame on CNN for behaving in a disorderly manner. Acosta is one of the most recognizable White House reporters and has gained both admiration and notoriety for his aggressive approach.\n\nSanders said Trump has granted unprecedented access to the press, exemplified by the 90-minute briefing on Wednesday. During a Thursday appearance on Fox News, counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway defended the president for fighting back against what she said is a hostile press.\n\n\"The president also said his press secretary, he, his administration is constantly being berated by members of the press,\" Conway said. \"And I'm one of the most pro-press people here. I am on TV daily, including on other networks, not just Fox.\"\n\nTrump has referred to some unidentified members of the news media as the \"enemy of the people,\" and has substantially cut down on solo news conferences, like the one Wednesday, compared to other presidents, opting instead to communicate through his press office or take questions more informally around the White House.", "\"I'm hoping that that will move Republicans to want to do the right thing here,\" said Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), a member of the Judiciary Committee. | Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images Congress \u2018We're not in the majority\u2019: Dems fret over threat to Mueller\u2019s probe Democrats are anxious that the interim attorney general will interfere with Mueller's investigation before they take power.\n\nHigh-flying House Democrats eager to use their new power to protect Robert Mueller from a new threat are finding themselves in a familiar position: powerless and at the mercy of Republicans.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions with a loyalist has turbo-charged concerns that he's going to squeeze Mueller's probe out of existence, possibly before Democrats take over the House on Jan. 3.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat means Democrats, despite their imminent ascendancy, have been forced again to plead with outgoing Republican leaders to do something \u2014 anything \u2014 to protect Mueller.\n\n\"The fact that they know they will not be in charge in January, I'm hoping that that will move Republicans to want to do the right thing here,\" said Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi convened a conference call on Thursday to discuss Sessions' ouster with their entire caucus, as well as dozens of incoming freshmen. It was the first caucus-wide call for the incoming majority and was meant, sources familiar with the planning say, to convey the depth of the \"crisis moment.\"\n\nDemocrats have long foreshadowed that winning the majority would help ensure that Mueller could continue his work unimpeded by a Republican Congress they accused of working to undermine his investigation into the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia. But Trump's decision to replace Sessions with Whitaker, a former U.S. attorney, means a potential climactic moment for Mueller could arrive sooner than Democrats had hoped.\n\n\"It's very concerning,\" said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), another member of the Judiciary Committee, who noted that for now Democrats are limited to pressuring Republicans to take action. \"We just have to keep raising this. We're not in the majority.\"\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nWeeks away from assuming the gavels of the powerful Judiciary, Intelligence and Oversight Committees, Democrats have limited tools to take action. Instead, they responded to Trump's shakeup with a familiar tactic: issuing a strongly worded letter urging Whitaker to refrain from meddling in Mueller's probe. They also demanded that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, who is retiring in January, hold an \"emergency hearing\" on Whitaker's new role.\n\nBut the Democratic calls have been met with a familiar silence. Goodlatte's office has not responded to Democrats yet, and his office told POLITICO they had no plans to call such a hearing. Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), who is angling to become the top Republican on the committee next year, said such a hearing is unnecessary because Whitaker's appointment is temporary; there's a 210-day clock on his appointment pending Trump's decision to name a permanent replacement.\n\nBut Democrats worry that the most consequential moment has already arrived. Whitaker will immediately wield influence over the Mueller probe, and he has a long track record of questioning Mueller's authority and proposing ways to starve him of resources. He could deny courses of action requested by Mueller \u2014 from subpoenas to indictments to the public release of any findings.\n\nMueller allies are also hopeful that he's already taken steps to safeguard his findings from a more aggressive president \u2014 whether it's through the filing of unsealed indictments or the disbursement of his work to other sections of the Justice Department.\n\nOn their conference call, Democrats intended to discuss not just over actions that Trump could take to hamper Mueller. Committee leaders also planned to warn members that Whitaker could more stealthily erode Mueller's effectiveness by granting his GOP critics in Congress access to troves of sensitive documents that they've been requesting for months.\n\nTrump could again consider declassifying and releasing material connected to Mueller's ongoing investigation \u2014 a move he flirted with before the election but put on hold amid pushback from intelligence officials. Some Trump allies in the House, for example, have demanded the memo detailing the scope of Mueller's investigation as well as memos prepared by former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe that could factor into Mueller's look at whether Trump attempted to obstruct the Russia probe last year.\n\nOn the call, House Democrats plan to describe the nuances of their request for Whitaker and other federal agencies and officials to preserve documents relevant to the Russia probe so Democrats can access them when they're in the majority. They also intend to explain to colleagues pending legislation meant to protect Mueller's investigation from interference. But it could be weeks or months before the new Democrat-run committees are prepared to begin probing the transition of power at the Justice Department and whether Trump's personnel move was motivated by a desire to curb Mueller's probe.\n\nTrump allies say the suggestion that Whitaker would harm Mueller's operation is overblown. The president's personal attorney Jay Sekulow said on his radio show Thursday afternoon that regulations governing the special counsel would render Whitaker's impact limited.\n\n\"I don't think this is the sea change people are making it out to be,\" Sekulow said. \"If somebody would know it might be me. Our day to day work hasn't changed on this.\"\n\nAnd Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday told a Kentucky radio station that \"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance that the Mueller investigation will not be allowed to finish\" after Sessions was ousted.\n\nThough they note that they don't have the power to stop Trump or Whitaker from squeezing Mueller, Democratic aides emphasized that the threat of the looming Democratic takeover \u2014 a guarantee that any actions to undercut Mueller will be investigated \u2014 could serve as a deterrent. Cicilline also said he hopes Mueller would disregard any requests by supervisors to take improper actions to limit his work \u2014 or if he couldn't, to speak publicly about it.\n\n\"I think [Mueller has] demonstrated a level of professionalism and a level of integrity and a resistance to any interference by this administration,\" he said.\n\nCicilline added that any active effort by Trump to direct his subordinates to curtail Mueller's probe would be an \"abuse of power.\"\n\n\"I think we all have to be paying very close attention and these become actions which are dangerously close to an impeachable offense,\" he said.\n\nRachael Bade and John Bresnahan contributed reporting.\n\n", "Trump sets off alarm with 'nonsense' China claim\n\nWith help from Adam Behsudi and Megan Cassella\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This edition of Morning Trade is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Trade subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pro\u2019s comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy tools and services, click here.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT: President Donald Trump raised red flags for industry officials with an incorrect claim that China dropped its Made in China 2025 program. The Republican side of the House Ways and Means Committee prepares for massive turnover next year, while the Senate Finance Committee has to wait a few more days to find out if Chuck Grassley will take the gavel. And the ITC is seeking input on how eliminating duties on Japanese goods could affect the United States. Let\u2019s start here:\n\nTRUMP SETS OFF ALARM WITH \u2018NONSENSE\u2019 CHINA CLAIM: President Donald Trump incorrectly claimed on Wednesday that China \u201cgot rid of\u201d its Made in China 2025 program of state support for high-tech industries like robotics and artificial intelligence \u201cbecause I found it very insulting.\u201d\n\nWhile Chinese propaganda authorities have killed use of the term \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d because of international backlash, Beijing has not given up on the program it sees as key to its economic development.\n\nThat disconnect from reality is worrying industry, which told POLITICO that Trump is either exaggerating the importance of largely cosmetic changes from Beijing or he\u2019s mistaken the elimination of a slogan with the need for China to make fundamental reforms to policies that put American firms at a severe competitive disadvantage. One industry official called Trump\u2019s statement \u201ctotal and utter nonsense.\u201d Pro Trade\u2019s Doug Palmer has more here.\n\nProspects for Trump-Xi: It\u2019s possible the upcoming meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit at the end of the month will lead to the launch of serious negotiations, rather than a full deal to end the tariffs and retaliatory tariffs between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nBut there\u2019s still anxiety that Trump could settle for empty gestures as progress, as his Wednesday statement seemed to indicate. \u201cThe president, like several presidents before him, seems to be confusing form over substance with regard to China trade,\" said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who specializes in China and India.\n\nMidterm sway on China? Not really: Despite losing Republican control of the House, Trump is unlikely to be persuaded to drop his hardball tactics with China. \u201cDemocrats probably support President Trump on China more than Republicans. In the end, I see President Trump likely to get a win on China,\u201d said Greg Mastel, a former Senate Finance Committee staffer now at the law firm Kelley Drye. Doug has more here.\n\nIT\u2019S THURSDAY, NOV. 8! Welcome to Morning Trade, where your host must admit she\u2019s glad the midterms are mostly behind us, so we can go ahead with obsessing over what the future of USMCA looks like in a soon-to-be divided Congress. Thoughts on where trade is heading with a Democratic-majority House? Let me know: srodriguez@politico.com or @sabrod123.\n\nYour 2018 Midterms HQ: The countdown is on. Policy professionals know the 2018 midterms represent more than keeping track of winners and losers. The outcome of high-stake contests could dramatically alter the course of policymaking across the country. Go beyond election night with POLITICO Pro\u2019s 2018 Midterms HQ. Read More.\n\nJoin POLITICO on Nov. 14 for special editorial conversations at The Salute to Military Spouses, a half-day summit to raise awareness of the challenges and contributions of these unsung heroes. As the exclusive media partner of the summit, POLITICO journalists will provide firsthand insight and intelligence on timely political and policy issues facing the military and military spouses. RSVP here.\n\nGET READY FOR NEW WAYS AND MEANS REPUBLICANS: The Republican side of the House Ways and Means Committee will look dramatically different next year, with nine members leaving their seats after retiring, seeking another office or losing their races on Tuesday. Reps. Sam Johnson (R-Texas), Dave Reichert (R-Wash.), Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.), Kristi Noem (R-S.D.), Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.), Diane Black (R-Tenn.), Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), Mike Bishop (R-Mich.) and Jim Renacci (R-Ohio) will not be returning to the committee next year.\n\nRep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), the chairman of the committee, will continue as the panel\u2019s ranking member next year, his spokesman confirmed.\n\nTrade implications: The massive turnover is significant, especially as the committee will be busy working on new trade deals over the next two years. The committee will be the first stop for the administration\u2019s new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement when it is sent to Congress for approval next year. The Trump administration will also have to consult regularly with the panel if it wants to secure fast-tracked passage for potential trade deals with Japan, the European Union and United Kingdom.\n\nThe vacancies also leave open the possibility that the GOP side of the panel could experience a shift in ideology, especially if it is populated with new Republican members, who for political reasons, side more with Trump\u2019s non-traditional views on trade.\n\nPASCRELL SEEKS WAYS AND MEANS TRADE SPOT: Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.), ranking member of the Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, has requested to take over the top trade position on the panel next year in a letter to panel members. If selected, he would likely serve under Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), who is on track to assume the chairmanship of the full committee.\n\nNot so fast: Pascrell isn\u2019t next in line based on seniority. Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and Ron Kind (D-Wis.), in that order, have first dibs and both lawmakers are interested in the job, said a senior Democratic aide familiar with the internal deliberations. Both Blumenauer and Kind are among some of the most trade-supportive Democrats in the House and have been publicly critical of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nKind could pose the most direct challenge to Pascrell\u2019s bid because Blumenauer has his eye on chairing a subcommittee that has yet to be created. Blumenauer is pushing Democratic leaders to form a new infrastructure financing subcommittee within Ways and Means. That would put Kind next in line to accept the trade position.\n\nThe aide, who doesn\u2019t work for any of the lawmakers in question, said Pascrell\u2019s selection would bypass a seniority-based process that has long been used to appoint positions within the committee. The letter also shines a spotlight on what is normally an internal selection process that won\u2019t occur until mid-January, the aide said.\n\nNO WORD ON FUTURE OF SENATE FINANCE JUST YET: It remains to be seen if Sen. Chuck Grassley will return to leadership of the influential Senate Finance Committee in 2019 when Sen. Orrin Hatch retires at the end of his term. The Iowa Republican \u201cwill consult with his colleagues when the Senate returns next week and will then announce his decision,\u201d Grassley\u2019s communications director, Michael Zona, said in an email Wednesday.\n\nNatural fit: Grassley served as the top Republican on the panel from 2001 to 2011. Taking the high-profile gavel would give the Iowa lawmaker power to help steer Trump\u2019s trade agenda next year. It would also be a logical fit for Grassley, who has previously expressed concern over the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on Iowa farmers. He has two years of eligibility remaining to serve as chairman.\n\nShould Grassley pass on the Finance chairmanship, Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) is expected to give up his top Banking Committee spot to become Senate Finance chairman.\n\nITC SEEKS INPUT ON EFFECT OF DROPPING DUTIES ON JAPAN GOODS: The U.S. International Trade Commission announced Wednesday that it plans to submit a report to USTR by Jan. 24 that outlines the probable economic effects of eliminating duties on Japanese imports. The ITC investigation comes after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer notified Congress last month of its intent to start trade negotiations with Japan. Those talks could start as soon as mid-January.\n\nAt Lighthizer\u2019s request, the ITC will also look at how dropping tariffs on Japanese agricultural goods would affect the U.S. agricultural industry and economy.\n\nThe ITC will hold a hearing on the investigation on Dec. 6. Requests to speak at the hearing must be submitted by Nov. 26. More from the ITC on the investigation here.\n\nJAPAN WOOING U.K. TO JOIN TPP: Japan and other members of the 11-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership pact are actively encouraging the United Kingdom to join the agreement, Antony Phillipson, U.K. trade commissioner for North America, told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.K. is exploring the possibility of joining the TPP because of \u201cconversations that we\u2019ve had with a number of key partners in that, including the Japanese, which have been very enthusiastic about our joining,\u201d Phillipson said. He also mentioned Singapore, another TPP member, in that context.\n\nIt could be several months before a formal decision is made, since a U.K. public comment period on joining the TPP just ended on Oct. 26, he said. In the meantime, the U.K. is preparing to begin trade talks with the United States as soon as it leaves the European Union, which is currently expected on March 29, Phillipson said. More here.\n\nTRADE REMEDY CORNER\n\nSELF-INITIATION CASE COMES TO A CONCLUSION: The Commerce Department slapped triple-digit duties on most imports of common alloy aluminum sheet from China, bringing the department\u2019s first \u201cself-initiated\u201d case to a conclusion on Wednesday.\n\nThe combined anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties of more than 100 percent will formally take effect on the roughly $900 million worth of the material the U.S. imports from China annually only after the U.S. International Trade Commission gives its OK, which is expected by Dec. 20.\n\nDUTIES ON LARGE DIAMETER WELDED PIPE: Commerce also announced Wednesday it has found evidence that imports of large diameter welded pipe from China and India are being unfairly subsidized and dumped in the United States at less than fair value. In its final ruling, the department moved to impose anti-dumping duties of 132.6 percent on Chinese imports and 50.6 percent on Indian imports, and countervailing duties of 198.5 percent on Chinese imports and 541.2 percent on Indian imports.\n\nImports of large diameter welded pipe from China and India last year were valued at an estimated $29.2 million and $294.7 million, respectively, Commerce said. The case now moves to the U.S. ITC for a final injury determination also expected on Dec. 20.\n\nINTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT\n\n\u2014 Canada\u2019s ambassador to Washington says Democratic concerns about USMCA could be resolved without reopening deal in 2019, POLITICO Pro reports.\n\n\u2014 U.K. official remains cautious on potential U.S. demands in trade negotiations, POLITICO Pro reports.\n\n\u2014 Canadian ambassador says no big USMCA signing ceremony with Trump if steel and aluminum tariffs aren\u2019t lifted, CBC News reports.\n\n\u2014 Lobsters dealt big blow in U.S.-China trade war, Bloomberg Businessweek reports.\n\nTHAT'S ALL FOR MORNING TRADE!

The dust has barely settled on the midterm elections, yet tax talk is already in the air thanks to President Donald Trump signaling openness to higher taxes, at least for some. Riffing at a post-election press conference at the White House, Trump said he\u2019d be open to making an \u201cadjustment\u201d to recent corporate and upper-income tax cuts to draw Democrats to his proposal for further middle-class tax cuts. Asked if he\u2019d be willing to raise rates on corporations and wealthy individuals to get another middle-class tax cut, Trump replied: \u201cIt could be.\u201d\n\nThose off-the-cuff comments are sure to spark concerns among Republican leaders who pushed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1 (115), through Congress last year without Democratic support, as well as businesses that fought hard for the tax cuts, reports our Toby Eckert and yours truly. \u201c[A]s an example, if the Democrats come up with an idea for tax cuts, which I am a big believer in tax cuts, I would absolutely pursue something even if it means some adjustment,\u201d Trump said. He caught members of his own administration and Republican lawmakers by surprise last month when he said the GOP was working on a 10 percent tax cut for the middle class. During Wednesday's press conference, Trump also suggested he could find common ground with Democrats on health care and infrastructure.\n\nNot so fast, said one prominent Republican activist who dismissed the comments, Grover Norquist. The anti-tax crusader argued that Trump was hypothesizing in his normal style and most assuredly was not dangling higher tax rates for a deal with Democrats or making an announcement. Trump still wants a 15 percent corporate tax rate, according to Norquist. \u201cIt was a hypothetical that shouldn't have been answered,\u201d Norquist said. \u201cBut you can't tell the president not to answer hypotheticals because he does what he wants.\u201d Trump didn\u2019t comment when asked about specific numbers. The tax overhaul he signed into law last year slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and lowered the top marginal rate for individuals to 37 percent from 39.6 percent.\n\nSeveral business groups contacted by POLITICO declined to comment on Trump\u2019s remarks. But some were already circling the wagons around the tax cuts after Democrats took the House on Tuesday. The RATE Coalition, which represents major corporations, issued a statement saying: \u201cAs America's global competitors take steps to lower their respective rates and undercut our recently restored edge, the RATE Coalition will continue to work tirelessly on a bipartisan basis to protect the corporate tax rate responsible for generating such critical economic wins in all corners of the country.\u201d NFIB President and CEO Juanita D. Duggan said: \u201cThe 115th Congress achieved substantial progress for small businesses by removing burdensome regulations and making small business tax relief a reality. The next Congress must continue this progress, including protecting the tax cuts that have made a significant difference for millions of small businesses across the country.\u201d\n\nIt could take about $2.1 trillion over a decade for an additional middle-class tax cut loosely based on Trump\u2019s talk, according to Kyle Pomerleau of the Tax Foundation. Using the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation\u2019s distribution of the federal tax burden, he simulated a 10 percent reduction in each group\u2019s tax burden below $200,000, which Pomerleau conceded was \u201ca very generous definition of middle class.\u201d That totaled $143.8 billion this year, which he projected forward 10 years based on the expected growth of tax receipts to reach the roughly $2.1 trillion cost.\n\nMeanwhile, opponents kept up their drumbeat against the new law. \u201cVoters resoundingly declared that Republicans\u2019 sole legislative achievement \u2014 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TJCA) \u2014 was a failure, rejecting both the GOP\u2019s tax scam and the Republicans who championed it,\u201d said a statement by Not One Penny, one of the most outspoken foes of the tax cuts.\n\nWELCOME TO THURSDAY at Morning Tax, where we\u2019d love to hear from you.\n\nEmail: bbecker@politico.com, teckert@politico.com, bfaler@politico.com, alorenzo@politico.com.\n\nTwitter: @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brianfaler, @aaronelorenzo,@POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax.\n\nYour 2018 Midterms HQ: The countdown is on.

RSVP here.\n\nTRUMP TAX RETURN TRAVAILS: Everyone knows House Democrats want to get their hands on Trump\u2019s tax returns, which he\u2019s refused to disclose, and they can. The expected next chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), will legally be able to examine them in private once the administration turns over the documents. But that transfer isn\u2019t expected to be easy, and Democrats will face risks when they actually have Trump\u2019s tax returns in hand, our Brian Faler reports. The reason? It's a felony to improperly disclose tax information, punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nNeal expects resistance when he calls for the Trump tax returns and foresees a legal battle ahead. \u201cI assume that there would be some sort of a court case, but we\u2019d have to wait and see,\u201d he told the Washington Post. Trump during his press conference repeated his past claim that he couldn\u2019t provide his tax returns because they are under a \u201ccontinuous\u201d audit, but added that even if they were released, \u201cpeople would not understand them,\u201d reports our Caitlin Oprysko. Asked whether he\u2019d try to block Democrats trying to get them released, Trump told reporters at a post-midterm press conference that he \u201cwould have an open mind to it\u201d when the audit was finished. Democrats aren\u2019t buying it. \u201cPeople know a cheat when they see one,\u201d tweeted Senate Finance ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).\n\nTo avoid leaks, Neal shouldn\u2019t cart Trump\u2019s returns to Capitol Hill and instead should analyze the paperwork at the IRS, said Janice Mays, a former chief counsel for Ways and Means Democrats during her long tenure with the panel.\n\nIRS INSIDE DOPE: The IRS is looking to tax professionals to assist its \u201cGet Ready\u201d campaign for the first tax filing season under the TCJA. \u201cDespite all the work done so far (i.e. paycheck checkup), the taxpayer will likely be surprised and may be angry at the results,\u201d National Conference of CPA Practitioners President Stephen Mankowski said in a recap of the October meeting of the agency\u2019s National Public Liaison group. \u201cWhile most taxpayers will see a decrease in tax liability, the withholding tables might result in lower refunds. Also, the IRS will be issuing communications regarding \u2018what if the taxpayer owes taxes\u2019 to help reduce anxiety. The taxpayer will then have a baseline for 2019 to make necessary changes.\u201d\n\nOther tidbits in the report: New 1040 forms and schedules will be available by mid-December. \u2026 The new tax deduction for non-corporate businesses remains an IRS priority. \u201cThere are still some issues to finalize before tax season.\u201d \u2026 \u201cThere is a problem with the current CAF [Centralized Authorization File] system due to a 30% increase in breaches of tax preparer offices.\u201d\u2026 Newly minted IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig dropped by the meeting. \u201cTom Cullinan, a tax attorney from Atlanta and former colleague of Rettig, will be joining the Commissioner\u2019s office; however, we don\u2019t know his title or position just yet. Overall, Rettig believes that the IRS can be more proactive with Congress as to what is working and not working.\u201d\n\nINSULT TO INJURY: Trump called out two Ways and Means GOP members on Wednesday for refusing his \u201cembrace\u201d and going down to defeat. \u201cPeter Roskam didn\u2019t want the embrace, Erik Paulsen didn\u2019t want the embrace,\u201d Trump told reporters, after reeling off several Republicans in tough races who welcomed his help. \u201cOn the other hand you had some that decided to \u2014 let\u2019s stay away, let\u2019s stay away,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey did very poorly. I\u2019m not sure that I should be happy or sad, but I feel just fine about it.\u201d\n\nReality check: Neither Roskam nor Paulsen was in a Trump-friendly district. In fact, Trump was probably a drag on them. Hillary Clinton carried Roskam\u2019s district by 7 points in 2016 and Trump\u2019s approval rating there was 36 percent in a pre-election poll by The New York Times and Siena College. Clinton took Paulsen\u2019s district by 9 points and Trump\u2019s approval rating was at 33 percent. Bloomberg said the TCJA\u2019s new cap on deducting state and local taxes was a factor in their losses.\n\nINTERNATIONAL UPDATE\n\nBRITS UNVEIL MORE DIGITAL TAX DETAILS: The U.K.\u2019s planned digital services tax doesn\u2019t violate international treaties on double taxation, according to a newly released consultation document from the government there, reports our colleague abroad, Nicholas Vinocur. The consultation also said the 2 percent tax on large digital companies\u2019 revenue won\u2019t have negative economic consequences. Speaking to reporters in Washington, U.K. Trade Commissioner for North America Antony Phillipson said minimal consumer impact is expected from the tax, which he said isn\u2019t aimed at particular countries or companies, as I report. British officials aren't worried their digital services tax proposal will trigger U.S. retribution, Phillipson said.\n\nPONDERING FACEBOOK PROBE: Facebook\u2019s European tax arrangements could be facing an investigation by EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager \u201cas she deepens her multinational investigation into sweetheart tax deals, two people close to the case said Wednesday,\u201d reports our Thibault Larger. The company late last year announced it would alter how it pays tax on its global operations, but such changes can be immaterial to state aid cases because they focus on unpaid sums over certain periods in the past.\n\nSTATE NEWS\n\nAMAZON JUNGLE: New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy swiped back at state Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr. for saying that a boost in the state\u2019s corporate business tax probably ruined its chances of luring Amazon\u2019s new headquarters. Our Katherine Landergan reports that Murphy said at a press conference: \"Taxes have never come up [with Amazon] in terms of what we did in the budget. I appreciate Sen. Kean weighing in. I notice he's weighing in a lot over NJ Transit over the last 9 months, bless his heart, I'd like to know we are fixing the damn thing.

While the exact scale of the changes is TBD, we can see the shape of what\u2019s to come:\n\n\u2014 The House: With Democrats taking the House, there will be a whole new cast of characters in leadership. Party leaders began to signal their upcoming moves Wednesday, and we can start to prognosticate what\u2019s going to happen next. The best guess right now is that we will see Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019, though many in the incoming Democratic class have said they\u2019d like to see change atop the caucus.\n\nFurther down the totem pole, Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado has said she\u2019s running for majority whip, the number three job in the House. That\u2019s currently Rep. Jim Clyburn\u2019s spot, meaning that we could see a high-profile race in caucus leadership. Long-time health care watchers know that DeGette, of Colorado, was one of the architects of the mammoth 21st Century Cures Act.\n\nWe also got a sense of committee chairs\u2019 priorities. Rep. Frank Pallone, the presumptive leader of the Energy and Commerce Committee, circulated a list of priorities to reporters Wednesday. Of note on Pallone\u2019s list: lowering health care costs; protecting net neutrality; and providing meaningful privacy protections. The last item on the list is particularly important: Pallone was opposed to the 42 CFR Part 2 rule overhaul that consumed so much attention during negotiations over the massive opioid legislation, and many observers are discussing the possibility of bipartisan national privacy legislation. Our Health Care colleague Adam Cancryn has a more in-depth look at the New Jersey pol\u2019s priorities here.\n\nEnergy and Commerce\u2019s Health Subcommittee is another a spot to keep an eye on: Rep. Anna Eshoo has said she\u2019s interested in chairing the panel. The Silicon Valley Democrat has long been known as a telehealth booster.\n\nOne last potential committee chair to keep an eye on: Mark Takano at Veterans\u2019 Affairs. Takano did a Q&A with our own Arthur Allen and broke down his priorities for the panel. The Southern Californian Democrat praised his predecessor, Phil Roe, for his bipartisan approach to committee business and said he\u2019d continue it, were he to chair the committee. Takano said he\u2019d be keeping an eye on the Cerner implementation at the VA, as he\u2019d been interviewing potential staffers with tech backgrounds. \u201cIt will take some strong, technical expertise to oversee this,\u201d he said. He also seems to be skeptical about the parallel implementation at Defense, saying, \u201cMy initial impressions of the early rollout [at the military] weren\u2019t great.\u201d\n\nAt a lower level, some in-doubt races got resolved \u2014 or close to it \u2014 on Wednesday. Texas Republican Rep. Will Hurd, who has focused on IT and cybersecurity issues, holds a narrow edge \u2014 just over a thousand votes \u2014 in his closely contested race against Gina Ortiz Jones. Wednesday afternoon, the Democrat vowed not to concede until all votes \u2013 which include overseas military ballots and provisional votes \u2014 were counted.\n\nIn New Jersey, meanwhile, Democrat Andy Kim holds a narrow edge over Rep. Tom MacArthur, a key dealmaker in Republicans\u2019 2017 quest to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u2014 Senate: Republicans tightened their hold on the Senate, though the exact composition of the upper chamber of Congress isn\u2019t yet determined.\n\nStill, GOP legislators signaled some of their priorities for the upcoming session. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley may jump chairs \u2014 from Judiciary to Finance \u2014 a move that could presage tough oversight or reform bills, our colleagues Rachel Roubein and Sarah Karlin-Smith write. Grassley has been a longtime advocate for two eHealth-related issues: the Open Payments database displaying money that flows to doctors from pharma and device companies; and unique device identifiers.\n\nDemocrats scored a key hold, as Sen. Jon Tester of Montana prevailed by a thin margin on Wednesday. Tester, the ranking member of the Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee, helped end Ronny Jackson\u2019s ill-fated nomination to lead the VA.\n\n\u2014 The president: Donald Trump began a shake-up of his administration Wednesday, shuffling Attorney General Jeff Sessions off stage left. (Sessions, as we\u2019ve previously reported, had been interested in using prescription drug monitoring programs\u2019 data to crack down on the opioid crisis.)\n\nIn a long press conference, the president also signaled at least some willingness to work with the new House majority, saying he could work with Democrats on drug prices and social media regulation.\n\neHealth tweet of the day: Sarah Kliff @sarahkliff \u201c[following up on previous report of needing to schlep a CD-ROM of X-rays from one doctors\u2019 office to another] Addendum: got a call from my doctors office - the files on the CD are in the wrong format! So now we are just going to redo the x-rays.\n\nNot because I *need* new x-rays, but because there isn\u2019t a way to transfer the data.\u201d\n\nTHURSDAY: Hope everyone is rested and recovered from Tuesday night\u2019s election results.

Whether in referendum, or for politicians pledging to expand, voters blessed Medicaid, our colleagues Rachana Pradhan and Alice Miranda Ollstein write.\n\n\u201cThis election proves that politicians who fought to repeal the Affordable Care Act got it wrong,\u201d said Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of The Fairness Project, which bankrolled the Medicaid ballot initiatives. \u201cExpanding access to health care isn\u2019t a blue-state value or a red-state value; it\u2019s an American value.\u201d\n\nRESEARCH CORNER\n\nRESEARCH ROUNDUP: Some notable research and reports to share:\n\n\u2014 Machine learning and epidemiology: A team of public health officials, Google techies, and Harvard researchers have built a new machine-learning model to detect foodborne illnesses. The model, described in a Nature Digital Medicine article, uses Google search data to zero in on queries suggesting foodborne illnesses, and then see what restaurants those users have been visiting recently. (That\u2019s using location data, if you\u2019re someone who\u2019s squicked out by tech companies tracking you everywhere.)\n\nA pilot run of their model in Las Vegas and Chicago found that identified restaurants were more than twice as likely to be found unsafe following an inspection.\n\nAside from whatever privacy qualms one might have, there\u2019s one practical worry to keep in mind: Google Flu Trends, which used queries to estimate the incidence of the flu nationwide. It worked, until it didn\u2019t. For technical reasons, the authors think this model is more reliable \u2013 but we suppose nothing is ever foolproof.\n\n\u2014 Social determinant of health documentation: With increasing focus on the social determinants of health, a team of researchers wanted to know how frequently related data were documented in the EHR. The researchers, writing in Annals of Family Medicine, examined documentation at one system\u2019s community health centers, and found it was limited. They said there are compelling reasons for recording the data \u2013 but noted that clinics need passionate staff to steward the concept.\n\nTELECOM GROUPS BULLISH ON TV WHITE SPACES: Representatives from more than 40 companies are urging the FCC to modify its purview of TV white spaces, which operate on low frequencies and can, they say, easily and cheaply cover large areas. They say white spaces technologies are especially helpful in delivering broadband in rural areas.\n\nConnect Americans Now requested that the FCC issue a notice of proposed rulemaking \u2014 in addition to its existing White Spaces efforts \u2014 outlining higher power for devices that these groups could operate on without interfering with broadcasters; and higher placement of antennas, among other things.

As expected, Democrats took back the House, and Republicans maintained control of the Senate. If you thought the two chambers couldn\u2019t get along in this Congress, wait until you see what\u2019s in store next year. Expect a ramp up of partisan bickering and two very different approaches to policy. With that said:\n\nYes, it\u2019s infrastructure week: No, that joke isn\u2019t going away. Leaders are already talking about infrastructure. Potential House Speaker Nancy Pelosi mentioned it in her victory speech, and the next day Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it was an area he had already spoken to Pelosi about. \u201cThe one issue that leader Pelosi and I discussed this morning, where there could be a possible bipartisan agreement, is something on infrastructure,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday. And during a press conference, President Donald Trump said Democrats \u201cwill come to us with a plan for infrastructure \u2026 and we\u2019ll negotiate.\u201d\n\nEasier said than done: They may be talking the talk, but the walk is a very different story, as our Tanya Snyder wrote last month: Basic math and the tortured history of past infrastructure efforts suggest a tough road ahead. Plus, Trump didn't get very far with his $1.5 trillion package earlier this year, even with his party controlling both chambers. But one point in favor of collaboration: as The New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman reminded on Twitter, \u201cThe president always told people he preferred the Dem infrastructure plan to the Republican one.\u201d\n\nNew sheriff in town: Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), who will become House Transportation chairman, is also bullish on infrastructure. \u201cWelcome to the day after the election,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday. \u201cThis is the day we begin planning to deliver a major infrastructure package.\u201d He\u2019s met with the White House legislative affairs director and plans to meet with her again, and he\u2019s optimistic he can work with Trump on a bipartisan infrastructure plan with \u201creal investment\u201d \u2014 not \u201cpretend stuff\u201d like the asset recycling that former adviser DJ Gribbin put into Trump\u2019s proposal. Get the full download here.\n\nDon\u2019t forget: There\u2019s a push from some Democrats, led by Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), to create an infrastructure subcommittee on Ways and Means, which would be a forum for House Democrats to focus on the issue that has long dogged infrastructure attempts: revenue. DeFazio said he \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the concept.\n\nIT\u2019S THURSDAY: Thanks for tuning in to POLITICO\u2019s Morning Transportation, your daily tipsheet on all things trains, planes, automobiles and ports.

Commerce ranking member Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) is headed to a recount in Florida, although the initial tally suggests that he was beaten by Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.), a candidate for Transportation ranking member who had been trailing in the polls, has a lead against his Democratic challenger, but neither had conceded as of Wednesday night.\n\nOther survivors: Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), who stepped down from the committee in August after being indicted for campaign finance violations, won reelection, though his future is far from certain. Another committee member, Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), the longest-serving member of Congress, also hung on despite early reports that his seat was in jeopardy. The Senate Commerce Committee\u2019s Jon Tester (D-Mont.) also pulled out a late, turnaround victory.\n\nReax corner: American Association of Airport Executives President Todd Hauptli on the election results: \u201cConcrete knows no political affiliation.

In a letter to the Republican conference Wednesday, the Missourian called himself \u201cuniquely qualified,\u201d and he launched a website laying out his vision for the committee. As he told POLITICO in an interview last month, Graves says his top priorities are crafting an infrastructure bill and finding a long-term funding solution for the Highway Trust Fund. As mentioned above, it remains to be seen whether he\u2019ll have any competition. He\u2019s been jockeying with Denham for the job for two years, but the Californian still has to emerge from his district before setting sights on the committee.\n\nSUBCOMMITTEE SHAKEUP: Between retirements, promotions and election losses, there are plenty of changes cued up for the top spots on Transportation subcommittees. Most Democratic ranking members will move over to chairmanships, but as Tanya and Stephanie Beasley note, several subpanels will have new leaders including Highways and Transit, which will likely be taken by D.C.'s Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, and Railroads, which has several contenders. There\u2019s more uncertainty on the Republican side, with Denham and Graves facing uncertain futures.\n\nGAS TAX TEA LEAVES: California\u2019s rejection of a ballot measure aimed at repealing a 2017 gas tax increase was another defeat last night for Republicans, who had supported the referendum in hopes of boosting turnout. Some groups espect it will send a signal to Washington: \u201cCalifornia voters showed the public continues to support a user funded approach to infrastructure investment. That\u2019s a message the Trump administration and new Congress should heed as they consider a bipartisan infrastructure package and permanent revenue solution for Highway Trust Fund programs next year,\u201d said William Toohey, acting president of the American Roads and Transportation Builders Association.\n\nAviation\n\nLION AIR: FAA published an emergency directive Wednesday for those that operate Boeing 737 Max planes, about a week after the Lion Air crash near Jakarta that left 189 dead. The order is related to \u201cpossible erroneous angle of attack (AOA) inputs\u201d on those planes, according to an agency statement. \u201cThese erroneous inputs can potentially make the horizontal stabilizers repeatedly pitch the nose of the airplane downward, making the aircraft difficult to control,\u201d FAA said. Earlier this week, Boeing sent out a bulletin about the problem, as Bloomberg reported.\n\nMore to come? FAA said its emergency order, which demands an update to flight manuals, affects 45 planes in the U.S. operated by American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines. It added that it \u201ccontinues to work closely with Boeing, and as a part of the investigative team on the Indonesia Lion Air accident, may take further appropriate actions depending on the results of the investigation.\u201d\n\nTrucking\n\nTRYING AGAIN: Tanya has a story for Pros on the American Trucking Associations\u2019 latest argument that California\u2019s meal and rest break rules should be preempted by federal law, via a petition to FMCSA. \u201cAt issue is an 80-year-old California labor law that grants workers a 30-minute meal break in a five-hour work period unless the workers are under a collective bargaining agreement that meets certain standards,\u201d Tanya writes. \u201cCalifornia's transportation industry regulations also provide for 10 minutes of rest time for every four hours worked.\u201d The agency has rejected ATA\u2019s logic twice before during different administrations, but this is the first time it will consider the arguments under the Trump administration. In a public comment period that ended last week, groups including the Teamsters and trial lawyers wrote in opposition to ATA\u2019s effort.\n\nSOMETHING FUN: If you need half an hour to zone out after the madness of this week, but don\u2019t want to stray far away from transportation policy, check out the latest \"Simpsons\" episode.

Of these, Democrats won 15 contests and Republicans won 12 contests. But Republicans led in six out of seven races that hadn\u2019t been called by Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAs these numbers indicate, scare tactics on immigration worked more than they didn\u2019t work. But, that doesn\u2019t mean they always worked. Several Republican candidates closely aligned with President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration agenda were defeated, including Kansas gubernatorial nominee Kris Kobach and Rep. Dave Brat of Virginia, Hesson reports. More from Hesson here.\n\n\n\nExpect to hear more such heated rhetoric. White House aides say Trump\u2019s midterm pitch on immigration is a preview of how he intends to play the issue with a Democratic House, POLITICO\u2019s Megan Cassella, Nancy Cook and Gabby Orr report.\n\nOfficials say coming executive actions will allow \u201cTrump to claim progress on fixing the broken immigration system, and to tell supporters heading into 2020 he did so without Democrats\u2019 help.\u201d Trump has already promised to restrict asylum claims for migrants who are caught crossing into the U.S. illegally and end birthright citizenship. POLITICO\u2019s Ted Hesson reported late Thursday that the president \u201cwill take executive action, possibly as early as Friday, to limit the ability of migrants to seek asylum at the southwest border, an administration official confirmed Wednesday.\u201d More from Hesson here and from the Wall Street Journal here.\n\nBut there may be a sliver of room for cooperation between Trump and likely Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi: The unsolved problem of what to do with the roughly 700,000 DACA recipients. It\u2019s unlikely, though, that Trump will sign any bill that doesn\u2019t include border wall funding or stricter enforcement measures.

More from POLITICO's Eliana Johnson and Annie Karni here.\n\nDEMS ARE HIRING: Bloomberg BNA\u2019s Tyrone Richardson noted on Twitter yesterday that House Democrats were looking already to hire additional investigative counsel. A Daybook ad posted yesterday said Democratic staff on a House committee seek a lawyer to \u201cconduct congressional investigations and advise on policy matters related to oversight of the executive branch.\u201d Read the listing here.\n\nManagement-side attorneys Michael Lotito and James Paretti, Jr. of Littler Mendelson warn that potential hearings and subpoenas from the new House majority could further slow the already sluggish rulemaking process at agencies such as DOL, the NLRB, and OSHA.

NLRB\u2019s decision to renegotiate the agreement implemented one of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders on the federal workforce, but these were struck down in federal court.

Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), now the ranking member on the House Education and the Workforce Committee, told Morning Education\u2019s Kimberly Hefling he's hopeful Congress can pass a bipartisan bill to update the federal law governing higher education that President Donald Trump would sign. Observers, however, say he\u2019s dreaming.\n\n\u2014 Scott said he\u2019d like to see the committee start with House Democrats\u2019 \"Aim Higher\" bill, H.R. 6543 (115), that he and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi announced over the summer, with the goal of reaching out to House Republicans to get their input. \u201cIf it\u2019s got no Republican support, you can\u2019t believe it would have much of a chance in the Republican Senate,\u201d Scott said.\n\n\u2014 He also criticized Republicans' handling of their partisan PROSPER Act, arguing that Democrats didn't get enough notice to review it and contribute to the process. \u201cI would hope we would be able to start with the Aim Higher Act, go through the regular process of having hearings, giving people the opportunity to have input, and fashion a higher education bill that actually improves access to higher education, make sure that educational opportunities are available for those who want to get specific job skills but basically improve access to and affordability of higher education,\" Scott said. Kim has the full story.\n\n\u2014 Not so fast\u2026 \u201cThe fundamentals of passing an HEA reauthorization bill haven\u2019t changed,\u201d said Craig Lindwarm, assistant vice president of congressional and governmental affairs at the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities.\n\n\u2014 It still comes down to the Senate, where negotiations between Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) fell apart this year. Murray might have a little more leverage with Democrats in control of the House, Lindwarm said, but Alexander is still HELP chairman, Republicans still control the Senate and Trump still would have to sign the bill.\n\n\u2014 Silver lining? Alexander \u201cwants to get this done more than ever,\u201d said Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, the main higher education lobbying group. Alexander, he noted, is term limited in his role as chairman and up for reelection in 2020. \u201cThere will be people in both houses who are very anxious to move the legislation forward, but the overall political climate is so toxic that it\u2019s hard to imagine them making much progress,\u201d Hartle said.\n\n\u2014 \u201cWhile there is much day-after-elections talk of bipartisanship, it is hard to see the two sides working together in the lead-up to the 2020 cycle,\u201d said Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. The normal collegial instincts of incumbents to pass legislation before facing the voters will quickly give way to demonstrations of ideological purity as each party seeks to energize its base.\n\n\u2014 \u201cSomething like the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which beyond partisan philosophical differences also involves significant federal costs, would be even less likely to happen, given the inevitable blame game and finger-pointing around fiscal responsibility and the deficit,\u201d he said.\n\nIT\u2019S THURSDAY.

But teachers still notched some big victories, Caitlin Emma reports.\n\n\u2014 Democrats seized some GOP-held governorships on Election Day but failed to take others \u2014 including in Oklahoma and Arizona, where the walkouts consumed state capitals and made national headlines. Some state legislative chambers flipped, but Republicans maintained control in Arizona and West Virginia, another state with massive walkouts. It was also a mixed bag for state ballot initiatives and teachers and education activists running for office. Read more.\n\n\u2014 \u201cThere is no doubt that the results of tonight's major race was disappointing,\u201d Oklahoma teacher Alberto Morejon wrote on Facebook Tuesday night. Morejon helped orchestrate the teacher walkouts there, galvanizing tens of thousands of educators through a Facebook group that he still maintains.\n\n\u2014 The disappointment came in the Oklahoma governor\u2019s race. Republican Kevin Stitt beat Democrat Drew Edmondson by double digits. Edmondson supported the tax hikes designed to fund teacher raises in the state as a response to the teacher unrest. But Stitt didn\u2019t support the measure or new taxes. \u201cI know its [sic] not the outcome we wanted tonight ... but hold your head up high, because there is so much to be proud about,\u201d Morejon wrote to his thousands of followers.\n\n\u2014 Teachers unions and public education advocates scored two major wins, however. Tony Evers, the Democrat in charge of Wisconsin's public school system, narrowly defeated Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who was seeking a third term. And in Kansas, Democrat Laura Kelly defeated Republican Kris Kobach. Kobach backed a state law that would require 75 percent of school funding to be spent on classroom instruction and once compared school buildings to \u201ccrystal palaces.\u201d\n\nSUPER CLOSE SUPERINTENDENT RACES: A trio of state education chief races \u2014 in Idaho, Arizona and California \u2014 came down to the wire, with two still seemingly too close to call.\n\n\u2014 In California, Tony Thurmond, a Democratic state legislator and former social worker backed by teachers unions, refused to concede to fellow Democrat Marshall Tuck, who led by about 80,000 votes on Wednesday. \u201cWith millions of ballots left to be counted, we're digging in & waiting for every vote,\u201d Thurmond tweeted. \u201cThe kids of CA are in it for the long haul & we are too. I\u2019m so proud of the coalition we built & I thank the thousands of educators, students & public ed advocates who supported our campaign.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The race was closely watched, in part, because it generated more than $40 million in contributions. Tuck, the former president of a charter school organization who also was the CEO of an initiative that runs 18 district schools in Los Angeles, lost his bid for the nonpartisan seat in 2014. He was the heavy favorite among members of the education reform community, which favors charter schools.\n\n\u2014 The race in Arizona was nearly tied late Wednesday. Frank Riggs, a Republican charter school executive and former California congressman, was leading Democrat Kathy Hoffman, a speech pathologist and political newcomer with ties to the #RedforEd movement, by just more than 6,000 votes \u2014 less than half a point. \u201cThere are still votes left to count, and I want every voice for public education to be heard,\u201d Hoffman tweeted on Wednesday.\n\n\u2014 Idaho's Republican schools chief Sherri Ybarra on Tuesday held off a challenge from Democrat Cindy Wilson, a high school government teacher, in a tight race for the state's top education job. Ybarra held a nearly 3-point lead over Wilson, who campaigned on improving early childhood education and criticized a $20 million school safety proposal by Ybarra that focused heavily on hiring school security personnel. Ybarra has said she is committed to awarding master teacher bonuses.\n\nON THE HILL\n\nHOUSE GOP SHUFFLE COMING ON EDUCATION COMMITTEE: The House education committee is set to lose at least seven Republican members in January. Two GOP incumbents on the panel lost their reelection bids Tuesday. In Virginia, Rep. Dave Brat was unseated by Democratic challenger Abigail Spanberger. And Rep. Jason Lewis lost in Minnesota to Democrat Angie Craig.\n\n\u2014 Meanwhile, Republican incumbent Rep. Karen Handel of Georgia was trailing her Democratic opponent, Lucy McBath, by fewer than 3,000 votes on Wednesday in a race that has not yet been called. Those three potential losses come after four GOP members of the education committee did not seek reelection. Michael Stratford has the full rundown.\n\nEDUCATION DEPARTMENT\n\nFEDERAL EMPLOYEES UNION ASKS CONGRESS TO INVESTIGATE DEVOS: The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents Education Department workers, is calling on Congress to investigate Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019 planned reorganization of the agency. That inquiry could happen, as Democrats are now expected to ramp up their oversight of DeVos after gaining control of the House.\n\n\u2014 AFGE President David Cox said in a statement that DeVos is \u201cpushing through a sweeping reorganization that will result in many employees being displaced or moved into other jobs without the proper training or experience.\u201d He said, \u201cSecretary DeVos is undeterred and single-minded in her quest to decimate the Department of Education by making the agency such a miserable and untenable place to work that even the most dedicated employees will quit. We need Congress to step in now before more harm can be done.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Morning Education recently reported new details about the department\u2019s reorganization, including an overhaul of the office that deals with student data privacy and an elevation of the private school office so that it reports directly to DeVos. Education Department spokeswoman Liz Hill said at the time the reorganization effort is \u201cfocused on streamlining our internal processes in an effort to make the department more efficient, coordinated and responsive for students, educators, parents and taxpayers.\u201d\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE\n\nTRUMP ON DACA: \u2018WE\u2019LL SEE HOW IT WORKS OUT AT THE SUPREME COURT\u2019: Asked whether he\u2019d work with Democrats on a deal to grant deportation relief and work permits to roughly 700,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, Trump said he\u2019ll leave the issue to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u2014 \u201cWe could have done some pretty good work on DACA but a judge ruled that DACA was okay,\u201d Trump said during a contentious press conference Wednesday. \u201cHad the judge not ruled that way I think we would have made a deal. Once the judge ruled that way, the Democrats didn't want to talk anymore. \u2026 We'll see how it works out at the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The Justice Department this week petitioned the Supreme Court to intervene in several cases over the termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which Trump moved to end in September 2017. A San Francisco-based federal judge in January barred the Trump administration from ending the program and ordered it to resume processing DACA renewals. Two other federal judges followed with rulings against the termination. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments in May but has not yet ruled on the matter.\n\nALSO: Shortly before firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Trump insisted he\u2019s \u201cvery happy with most of my Cabinet. \u2026 We\u2019re looking at different people for different positions. You know, it\u2019s very common after the midterms. I didn\u2019t want to do anything before the midterms, but I will tell you that for the most part, I\u2019m extremely happy with my Cabinet.\u201d\n\nREPORT ROLL CALL\n\n\u2014 DeVos on Wednesday released a guide to help parents understand the report cards that states and school districts are required to publish under the Every Student Succeeds Act, detailing school performance.\n\nSYLLABUS\n\n\u2014 The midterms showed the diploma divide is likely here to stay: The Atlantic.\n\n\u2014 \"Scott Walker is out.

After the farm bill gets done (and it seems like it\u2019ll be a big \u201cif\u201d until it actually passes), Rep. Collin Peterson says House Democrats will eye stepped-up oversight of USDA next year, as we previewed in our Election night coverage.\n\n\u2014 Didn\u2019t get enough of the midterms? MA has all the late-breaking House and Senate farm-state results (and recounts!) that rolled in Wednesday.\n\n\u2014 Republicans romped to victory in state agricultural commissioner races in Georgia, Iowa, North Dakota and Texas, but Florida\u2019s contest is likely headed to extra innings.\n\n\u2014 Health advocates are licking their wounds after Washington voters approved a state ballot initiative to stymie new soda taxes. Oregon voters took the opposite tack, foiling beverage makers, who dreamed of forming a West Coast wall against new taxes on sugary beverages.\n\nPETERSON, THE FARM BILL AND 2019: Farmers and ranchers can look forward to a final farm bill before the end of the year, the current House Agriculture ranking member told reporters Wednesday, saying that farm bill negotiators are getting \u201crelatively close\u201d \u2014 whatever that means \u2014 to an agreement for a final measure that Congress can pass during the lame-duck session.\n\n\u2014 Ag industry groups fear that starting the farm bill process anew in 2019, with Democrats controlling the House, would mean a flurry of amendments contrary to industry\u2019s interests, like stricter subsidy limits and checkoff changes, writes Pro Ag\u2019s Helena Bottemiller Evich.\n\nThe commodity title is still not settled, but a handful of options are on the table for negotiators to consider, Helena reports.\n\nOn the nutrition title, Trump made what amounted to a potential threat to veto a farm bill lacking stricter work requirements for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients.\n\n\u201cWe could have a very fast [bill] without the work rules, but we want the work rules in,\u201d Trump said during a post-election press conference that lasted almost 90 minutes.\n\nOversight areas: Democrats could scrutinize Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue\u2019s plans to relocate the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture, other USDA efforts and, potentially, checkoff controversy, Peterson said.\n\nFlashback: Our look at Peterson as chairman amid a blue House wave.\n\nHAPPY THURSDAY, NOV. 8!

RSVP here.\n\nTHE FARM-STATE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE: Election results from agricultural regions kept coming in Wednesday, headlined by Democratic Sen. Jon Tester\u2019s reelection in Montana. The organic farmer, who lost three fingers to a meat grinder at age 9, pulled off the narrow win over Republican state auditor Matt Rosendale. It\u2019s Tester\u2019s third-straight Senate election win with 49 percent of the vote in mostly red Montana.\n\n\u2014 In California\u2019s Central Valley farmlands, Republican incumbents had a good night. Rep. Jeff Denham, a top Democratic target, had a slim lead over Democrat Josh Harder as votes were still being counted Wednesday evening. Voters also sent GOP Reps. Devin Nunes and David Valadao (both dairy farmers) back to D.C. for two more years.\n\n\u2014 Californians also approved Proposition 12, a ballot measure that requires more housing space for certain hens, pigs and calves. Out-of-state producers will also need to meet the new \u201ccage-free\u201d production standards to sell their goods in the Golden State. POLITICO\u2019s Sarah Zimmerman has the Prop 12 details.\n\n\u2014 A rare House GOP pickup: Republican Jim Hagedorn narrowly defeated Democrat Dan Feehan for the open Minnesota seat now held by Democrat Tim Walz (who was elected Minnesota governor on Tuesday). It\u2019s one of the only House districts that Republicans flipped from blue to red this cycle.\n\n\u2014 GOP candidates cleaned up in state ag commissioner elections: Incumbents like Sid Miller in Texas, Gary Black in Georgia, Mike Naig in Iowa, Doug Goehring in North Dakota and Hugh Weathers in South Carolina were all reelected.\n\nTHE FLORIDA RECOUNT FRENZY: At least five races in Florida appear destined for a recount, including the contest for state ag commissioner between Republican state Rep. Matt Caldwell \u2014 who has close ties to Florida\u2019s outgoing top agriculture official, Adam Putnam \u2014 and Democratic challenger Nicole Fried.\n\n\u2014 In the state\u2019s U.S. Senate race, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson was trailing Republican Gov. Rick Scott by fewer than 35,000 votes (0.4 percentage points).\n\nCaldwell led Fried by just 0.16 percent of the vote at one point on Wednesday, per the Tampa Bay Times. A Florida state Senate race and two state House races also were headed for a recount, and the governor\u2019s race, with an excruciatingly close vote tally, appeared like it too would be forced into a review, POLITICO Florida\u2019s Alexandra Glorioso reported.\n\n\u2014 Recounts likely won\u2019t be ordered until this weekend, as ballots won\u2019t be fully counted until Saturday at noon. Federal, state or multicounty races separated by 0.5 percent or less, will automatically undergo a machine recount, due Nov. 15. Those separated by 0.25 percent, or less, will automatically undergo a manual recount by Nov. 18.\n\nFried, an attorney and lobbyist for the state\u2019s growing medical marijuana industry, said in a statement Wednesday that she is \u201cgoing to ensure that every vote is counted.\u201d\n\n\u2014 What\u2019s at stake in the ag race? Sway over local handling of issues like water quality and delivery of hurricane relief. Florida\u2019s sugar industry, often blamed for the toxic blue-green algae blooms in Lake Okeechobee and along the Gulf Coast, contributed upwards of $1 million to Caldwell\u2019s campaign, the Miami Herald reported in August \u2014 more than Fried had raised overall at the time.\n\nCaldwell has said Big Sugar is used as a \u201cscapegoat\u201d for Florida\u2019s pollution problem, with rapid urban development also part of the problem.\n\nHEALTH ADVOCATES DECRY STATE SODA TAX LOSS: The beverage industry didn\u2019t succeed Tuesday night in setting up a legal blockade against soda taxes on the West Coast, but Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and other companies did score a major win in Washington state with the passage of Initiative 1634.\n\nThe measure, up 55 percent to 45 percent with votes still being counted Wednesday evening, prohibits new soda taxes statewide, though Seattle\u2019s existing tax on the sugary beverages won\u2019t be rolled back. In Oregon, voters rejected the similar Measure 103 overwhelmingly (43 percent to 57 percent).\n\nMoney questions: The results, which run counter to what polls were showing, raise interesting questions about whether health groups put their money in the right places this cycle.\n\nBillionaires Michael Bloomberg and Laura and John Arnold \u2014 major soda tax backers \u2014 together poured $3 million into Oregon, where there was already organized opposition to the tax measure (alongside other ballot questions). But no funding from either major source was spent in Washington. That left advocates there with no resources for TV ads or mailers while major beverage companies unloaded more than $20 million to promote the tax ban.\n\nAmerican Heart Association is bummed: AHA, the only major donor in Washington, said the fight for soda taxes is not over. \u201cFor sure this is a setback, but it\u2019s imperative that we continue to address chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, tooth decay and Type 2 diabetes in both children and adults with innovative public health policies,\u201d said Mary Ann Bauman, a Seattle doctor on AHA\u2019s board.\n\nROW CROPS\n\n\u2014 House leadership moves: Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) will run for GOP minority leader, as will Freedom Caucus co-founder Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). On the other side of the aisle, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) will run for Democratic majority leader, the post he held when Democrats last held the House majority. Catch up with POLITICO\u2019s Rachael Bade and John Bresnahan.\n\n\u2014 Trump open to corporate tax changes? The president said he would be willing to make an \u201cadjustment\u201d to recent tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals in order to attract Democratic support for additional middle-class tax cuts. Pro Tax\u2019s Toby Eckert has more.\n\n\u2014 The pork-soybean-corn triumvirate: The National Pork Board, United Soybean Board and National Corn Growers Association agreed on a \u201csustainability research platform,\u201d aiming to share and coordinate research on farm resilience and conservation. Here\u2019s the announcement.\n\n\u2014 No chairmanship news from Grassley: Sen. Chuck Grassley didn\u2019t announce which Senate committee he wants to chair in 2019. The Iowa Republican said he\u2019ll talk it over with his colleagues when the Senate reconvenes Nov. 13 before deciding whether to keep his post as Judiciary Chairman or take over the Finance Committee. Here\u2019s more from Pro Tax\u2019s Aaron Lorenzo.\n\n\u2014 GMO bugs and bio-weapons? The Defense Department is funding research into genetically modified insects and viruses that can help plants survive droughts and provide other benefits. Some scientists are skeptical the program is really about saving crops \u2014 rather than biological warfare capabilities. NPR has the story.\n\n\u2014 What is \u2018deferred maintenance\u2019 in inland waterways? Good question \u2014 a new GAO report found that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \u201cdoes not know how much deferred maintenance exists\u201d on locks and dams throughout the inland waterways system because it lacks an agreed-upon definition of the term. The report listed that as a main reason why funding infrastructure upgrades throughout some 12,000 miles of inland waterways has been so challenging. Sarah has more.\n\nTHAT\u2019S ALL FOR MA!

A spokesman for top Homeland Security Democrat Bennie Thompson, Adam Comis, told MC on Wednesday that panel Democrats would certainly focus on election security, \u201clack of cyber leadership from the White House\u201d and the security of the supply chain.\n\n\u201cCommittee on House Administration Democrats intend to advance sweeping legislation to overhaul our election security systems and standards to protect and secure our elections from interference, providing funding for states that move to an auditable, paper ballot system, and imposing greater vendor oversight,\u201d Peter Whippy, a spokesman for panel Democrats, said. Current top Democrat Robert Brady is set to depart. Rep. Zoe Lofgren is the panel\u2019s most senior Democrat, and she is expected to take the gavel next, a senior Democratic aide told MC.\n\nRep. Frank Pallone, top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce panel, listed \u201cmeaningful privacy and data security protections\u201d as among committee priorities in a news release. And Eddie Bernice Johnson, top Democrat on the Science Committee, said the panel would emphasize science, technology, engineering and mathematics education, a key element of building up the cybersecurity workforce.\n\nRepublicans also began throwing their hats in the ring for vacancies on the minority side of panels. Ashley Phelps, communications director for current Administration Committee vice chair Rodney Davis, said the Illinois Republican is \u201cqualified and well prepared to be Ranking Member of the committee if appointed by the next Minority Leader.\u201d She added that Davis \u201chas worked in a bipartisan way to lead the committee on important reforms such as shared employees, workplace harassment, and security improvements.\u201d Rep. Randy Weber announced his attention to seek the top Republican post on the Science panel.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\n\nSESSIONS OUT, WHITAKER IN; NEXT? \u2014 Incoming acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, whom the White House announced Wednesday is replacing Jeff Sessions, has previously suggested starving the budget of special counsel Robert Mueller, a move that could hamper any future pursuit of 2016 election Russian hackers and trolls. Mueller has delivered indictments against the alleged Kremlin-backed hackers who infiltrated Democratic emails and the \u201ctroll farm\u201d that spread propaganda and discord. With Sessions\u2019 departure, deputy AG Rod Rosenstein will no longer oversee Mueller\u2019s probe, instead handing control to Whitaker. Whitaker also has said prosecutors should have indicted Hillary Clinton over her use of a private email server.\n\nAlthough much of DOJ\u2019s enforcement efforts and court fights on cybersecurity are done at the staff level and can be expected to continue, Sessions had made cyber a part of his agenda. He created a cybersecurity task force this year, which released a report outlining cyber threats to the U.S. and the tactics DOJ would use to combat them. Sessions was part of the Trump administration\u2019s public campaign to gain access to encrypted communications. He voiced concern about the security threat posed by China buying stakes in U.S. tech companies, and accused China of violating a 2015 deal prohibiting cyber theft from U.S. firms for commercial gain. But Democrats blasted him as inattentive to election security.\n\nThe two favorites of oddsmakers to replace Sessions on a permanent basis, Rudy Giuliani and Kris Kobach, would bring their own baggage to the issue. Giuliani led a cyber working group for Trump that apparently did nothing. The Trump administration\u2019s Kobach-led voter security commission took fire over its handling of sensitive voter data.\n\nTHANKS, RUSSIA \u2014 After careful study, Russian observers found no irregularities with Tuesday\u2019s elections. The monitors, deployed through the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE, uncovered no discrepancies at the nine polling stations they visited in Maryland and Washington, D.C., MP Alexey Korniyenko told Russian news agency TASS. \u201cThe polling station employees were very cordial and answered all our questions,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them also talked in detail about the election process and voting equipment.\u201d\n\nINTERESTING PARTNERSHIP \u2014 Russia and Spain this week formed a cybersecurity working group designed to resolve conflicts over the spread of misinformation. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he discussed with his Spanish counterpart how \u201csome Russian mass media go beyond the limits of their professional activity and create inadmissible interference in other countries\u2019 issues.\u201d But he said it wasn\u2019t due to the Russian government\u2019s involvement, even though several of the most prominent Russian news outlets are state-owned.\n\nHOT FIELD \u2014 U.S. government and private-sector employers had more than 300,000 cybersecurity-related job openings as of August, according to data from the workforce analytics website CyberSeek, and cybersecurity workers are in higher demand than workers in general. \u201cAcross all occupations, there are currently 5.8 employed workers for every job opening. Within the cybersecurity field, the ratio of existing cybersecurity workers to the number of cybersecurity job openings is 2-to-3,\u201d the technical standards agency NIST said in a statement. \u201cThat means employers have fewer trained cybersecurity workers in the labor force to choose from and must look to other tactics\u2014including retraining current workers or attracting and training new talent\u2014to fill their needs for cybersecurity professionals.\u201d\n\nThe statistics are based on data collected between September 2017 and August. CyberSeek, a partnership between NIST, the analytics firm Burning Glass and the trade group CompTIA, is part of the government\u2019s effort to bring more concrete statistics to the often-nebulous problem of the cyber workforce gap. The site breaks down jobs into several categories, including \u201cOperation and Maintain\u201d and \u201cProtect and Defend.\u201d Unsurprisingly, Washington, D.C., is the top spot for cyber job openings, followed by New York City and Dallas.\n\nENSURING BETTER CYBER INSURANCE \u2014 Insurance companies can do more to protect private companies against cyberattacks, according to a report from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace released Wednesday. Governments can only help the private sector so much due to corporate reluctance to accept federal interventions and regulations, the report states, and the private sector simply does not have the resources to protect itself against sophisticated hackers.\n\nCurrent cyber insurance policies are limited, the report states, but insurance companies can take a larger role in understanding and managing cybersecurity risks. Insurance companies can create risk management practices while identifying and shaping trends in cybersecurity, the report states, effectively reducing the strain on government and corporate resources.\n\nTWEET OF THE DAY \u2014 *the deepest possible sigh*\n\nQUICK BYTES\n\n\u2014 Still in the air, part I: Florida Sen.

Hakeem Jeffries' move to become House Democratic Caucus chair is sure to shake up the race. | AP Photo/Andrew Harnik Congress Jeffries makes move for Democratic leadership position\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries is launching a bid to become House Democratic Caucus chair, a move some of his supporters hope would position him to one day become the first black speaker should he win.\n\nMultiple critics of Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi have been trying to get the Democrat from Brooklyn to challenge her for the job. Jeffries, while only 48 and just elected to his fourth term, is well liked in the Democratic Caucus and is seen as a rising star.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut Jeffries' declaration for the No. 4 position leaves Pelosi critics without a leader they believe they can win with. The group has been trying to find someone willing to challenge Pelosi but has thus far been unsuccessful.\n\nJeffries' move is sure to shake up the caucus chair race. Current Vice Caucus Chair Linda S\u00e1nchez is also trying to move up the ladder to claim the position. And Rep. Barbara Lee, another Congressional Black Caucus member, has also been whipping for the post, sending care packages of candy to offices in her bid to woo lawmakers and candidates.\n\nIn his \u201cDear Colleagues\u201d letter, Jeffries laid out his vision for the position, pointing specifically to President Donald Trump\u2019s penchant for spinning facts to say that House Democrats must have a clear message in countering him. The position oversees communications for the caucus.\n\n\u201cThere is an unconventional President in the Oval Office who dominates the news cycle with his outrageous claims, name-calling and falsehoods,\u201d Jeffries wrote. \u201cUndoubtedly, he will try to use the House Democratic Caucus as a foil to explain his shortcomings and inability to lead.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cMessage discipline helped carry us into the majority. To stay in charge, we must act aggressively on a bold legislative agenda and consistently message to the American people what we are doing to improve their quality of life.\u201d", "12 DEAD in THOUSANDS OAKS bar shooting -- L.A. SHERIFF headed to election upset -- KDL: Senate race still 'a victory' for Calif. voters -- LEVIN, HILL hand DEMS first two pickups -- PELOSI, McCARTHY launch next moves\n\nTHE BUZZ: BREAKING OVERNIGHT ... 12 DEAD IN MASS SHOOTING IN CALIFORNIA ... L.A. TIMES: \"Gunman kills 12 in 'horrific' mass shooting at Thousand Oaks bar packed with college students\": \"A gunman threw smoke bombs and rained bullets on a crowd of hundreds inside a Thousand Oaks bar Wednesday night, killing a dozen people including a Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Department sergeant who was trying to stop the carnage. ...\n\n\"The gunman was dressed in black when he burst into the Borderline Bar & Grill, a country-music-themed venue that is popular with college students, around 11:20 p.m., according to Sheriff Geoff Dean. ... A motive in the shooting was not immediately clear, but Dean said there was no evidence linking the attack to terrorism. Police believe the shooter used a handgun in the attack. Authorities did not immediately identify the gunman, but a law enforcement source, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case, described him as a 29-year-old armed with a handgun and a \u201csmoke device.\u201d Story.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSEVEN TAKEAWAYS from Tuesday\u2019s election results:\n\n-- POIZNER\u2019s LOSS IS GAVIN\u2019S GAIN: Many Republicans were hoping that tech executive and former Republican Steve Poizner would forge a path to elected office for moderate, business-friendly candidates in California \u2014 as an independent. And Poizner, in his second quest to be state insurance commissioner, not only had the experience, but the backing of 24 of 24 state newspaper endorsements to take it again. Thousands of votes still remain uncounted \u2014 but it appears Democratic state Sen. Ricardo Lara, who barely campaigned for the job, may now become the first openly elected gay statewide official. And that sigh of relief you hear is from the Gavin Newsom camp. Because had Poizner been successful, he would have been immediately on track to mount a decent, and possibly expensive challenge to Newsom for the top spot in 2022.\n\n-- SCHOOLS SCUFFLE: There was no larger disconnect between money spent and actual power at stake than in the state superintendent of public instruction race, which pitted second-time candidate Marshall Tuck against state Assemblyman Tony Thurmond. But for the outside antagonists who plowed an astonishing $41 million into this race, this was really a test of whether charters and wealthy individuals who advocate expanding charter schools and changing teacher employment laws could hand a loss to the California Teachers Association and its allies in the Democratic Party. With Tuck sitting on a narrow lead, this could be the test. And if he\u2019s successful, look to some moderates to tap Tuck for a run other offices in the future.\n\n-- ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 15: BARACK VS. BERNIE, WICKS BEATS BECKLES: The Dem-on-Dem East Bay clash between Obama campaign alum Buffy Wicks and Richmond City Council member Jovanka Beckles saw dueling endorsements from former President Barack Obama and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and a late flood of cash from interest groups \u2014 proving that in single-party Sacramento, interests group care about the type of Democrat that wins. The more mainstream Wicks (whose strength in ground game politics was honed in the Obama \u201808 presidential campaign) prevailed handily in the end, denying Beckles a chance to become Sacramento\u2019s lone democratic socialist.\n\n-- ICE-DRIVEN TACK TO THE LEFT? If his lead holds and Andrew Villanueva pulls off a stunning upset and unseats L.A. County Sheriff Jim McDonnell, count it as more evidence of the state\u2019s swing to the left. One of Villanueva\u2019s central arguments in the race was that the sheriff's department need to take stronger measures to distance itself from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as the LATimes reported. He was endorsed by progressive Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the former state Senate president pro tem who challenged Sen. Dianne Feinstein (more on that race below). The race is still a nail-biter, but it could be a game changer on criminal justice.\n\n-- FIRST FLIP: Democrat Mike Levin officially defeated Republican Diane Harkey in the 49th Distrist, the first red congressional seat California Dems have formally painted blue. Democrats worked to push Harkey into the general, and frustrated Republicans pointed to her lackluster performance -- like this rambling Q&A . Even outgoing Rep. Darrell Issa predicted Levin would claim his seat, which some point to as more evidence of the Trump collapse in the suburbs.\n\n-- SECOND SWITCH: Soon after the AP called the 49th for Levin, GOP Rep. Steve Knight called Democrat Katie Hill to concede. Anchored in the high desert of northeastern Los Angeles County, the 25th District has seen Democrats gradually build their registration advantage in another suburban district. The charismatic young Hill got plenty of glowing national press, including a laudatory HBO doc of her campaign that airs its final installation tonight.

Kevin de Le\u00f3n\u2019s challenge to storied incumbent Dianne Feinstein was seen as the longest of Democrat-on-Democrat long shots. But, according to the latest returns, it's only a single-digit loss that was closer than many pollsters predicted. De Leon argues that his hard-fought race \u2014 which included his surprising endorsement from the Democratic party\u2019s executive committee \u2014 was ultimately a win for California voters. And he doesn\u2019t regret it:\n\n-- DE LE\u00d3N: \u201cIt seems like it was a victory ... because for the first time in 25 years, we had a real conversation in California about the values we want represented in Washington. ... This tells you that something is happening in the California electorate \u2014 that Democrats, Republicans and decline to state voters are uneasy with the status quo.\u2019\u2019\n\n-- THE MONEY GAME: De Le\u00f3n notes that Feinstein had a $18 million warchest, much of it loaned to herself, vastly outspending de Le\u00f3n. \"And what I lacked in financial resources, I made up with in retail politics, going up and down the state,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI ran against a 26-year incumbent with 95 percent name recognition, he said. \"I was never supposed to be here ... a Latino-Asian kid with an Irish first name who grew up dirt poor.

But Manchin said he expects the Senate to act on legislation that would shield Mueller when the chamber returns on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWhat we'll do is go back on Tuesday and I think that we have legislation ready to go that protected Mueller, kept him in place, let him complete and finish,\u201d he said. \u201cI would hope that we can bring that back up, have the support, bipartisan support to protect this investigation to get it completed.\u201d", "It's unclear how long Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will stay in the hospital, but she will miss the investiture ceremony for Justice Brett Kavanaugh. | Robin Marchant/Getty Images Supreme Court Ruth Bader Ginsburg hospitalized after suffering fall\n\nSupreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fractured three ribs after suffering a fall Wednesday night in her office and has been admitted to the hospital, according to the court.\n\nThe court said Thursday morning that Ginsburg went home after the fall, and after experiencing discomfort overnight, she went to George Washington University Hospital, where tests showed she fractured three ribs on her left side.

The Supreme Court has had a Republican-appointed majority at all times since 1970, so the general trend of legal doctrine has been decidedly rightward for half a century. But the project of staffing a Republican judiciary has picked up speed under President Donald Trump. So far, the Trump administration has appointed 84 federal judges\u2014almost twice as many as President Barack Obama had appointed at the comparable stage of his administration.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNow, we can expect the appointment of conservative judges to accelerate even more. With the House in Democratic hands, stocking the judiciary is something consequential that the Republican-controlled Senate can get done over the next two years. Still, just how long and how much those appointments will matter won\u2019t be known until the 2020 electoral cycle runs its course.\n\nEven with no further judicial appointments, the courts are poised to move the law significantly to the right. As a consequence of the Republican Senate\u2019s stonewall of Merrick Garland and the replacement of Justice Anthony Kennedy with Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court now has a majority that might fulfill many conservatives\u2019 long-held hopes of overruling Roe v. Wade and banning all race-based affirmative action.\n\nBut the ongoing transformation of the judiciary may reach considerably farther than those two landmarks, significant though they are. Trump\u2019s appointees are not merely very conservative, though as a group they are that. Many of them are also leading members of an elite legal vanguard associated with the Federalist Society, and an unusually high proportion have worked as legal academics. They come to the bench from years of thinking systematically about what they believe to be wrong with American law and what courts could do to move toward their visions\u2014whether conservative or libertarian\u2014of how the law should function. Their project, in other words, is not simply to decide cases and let the chips fall where they may. It is also to put in practice a set of theoretical commitments about American law that have germinated for decades within the Federalist Society and a related constellation of institutes and think tanks.\n\nAnd although the generalization is not without its exceptions, the Trump nominees also tend to be highly capable as legal technicians. In many other spheres, the sheer incompetence of Trumpworld\u2019s dramatis personae has been an obstacle to the effective implementation of programs. But the judicial nominees tend to be smart and skilled: the sort of people who will accomplish what they set out to do. Over time\u2014and it might not take very long\u2014a judiciary in which they are a powerful force is likely to have a broad impact across many fields of governance. It will become harder for government to regulate industry to protect the environment. The law of the workplace will become yet more friendly to employers. Consumer protection laws imposing labeling requirements might be struck down as violations of free speech. And the already-hobbled practice of using class action litigation to vindicate the legal rights of large, disparate groups of Americans injured by large corporations will become even further constrained.\n\nMoreover, the sheer number of Trump\u2019s judicial appointees may make it difficult for future Democratic presidents to reverse the trend. Not all presidents come into office with the same opportunities to make appointments. At the end of Obama\u2019s presidency, many judgeships were vacant, largely because the Republican Senate had refused to confirm nominees. Trump could therefore fill a large number of positions quickly. If a Democrat defeats Trump in 2020, it\u2019s a good bet that the current Senate will make sure to fill every available judicial vacancy before the new administration takes over, thus giving the next president a much higher hill to climb in any attempt to move the judiciary back toward the political center.\n\nIf the Republicans maintain control of the Senate past 2020, that hill would likely be insurmountably high even if a Democrat became president. Given the Garland model, the chances are good that a Republican Senate would refuse to let a Democratic president make any serious moves toward countering the gains that Republicans made in the judiciary under Trump.\n\nFurthermore, between now and 2020, the judiciary is likely to play a considerable role in shaping whether the Republican Party maintains its political control of judicial appointments. That\u2019s because in addition to abortion, affirmative action, and all sorts of social and economic issues connected to the modern administrative state, the courts now play an important role in the shaping of elections. With Citizens United and other campaign-finance decisions permitting the broad use of corporate treasuries for electioneering, and with decisions like Shelby County gutting the provisions of the Voting Rights Act that for half a century impeded the efforts of southern states to blunt minority voting power, the Supreme Court may already have given a considerable boost to Republican political fortunes. It is anyone\u2019s guess whether the thin margins of Republican victory in major 2018 races in places like Texas, Georgia and Florida would have held up in a world where the Supreme Court had not adjusted the playing field in these ways.\n\nAnd the Supreme Court currently seems willing to do more in a similar direction. Consider New York v. Department of Commerce, a case now before a federal trial court in which a group of states alleges that the Commerce Department deliberately introduced a question about citizenship to the 2020 census in the hopes of deterring non-citizens from responding to census inquiries, thus undercounting the population in Democratic-leaning areas and skewing 2020 reapportionments toward Republicans. Several of the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative justices have indicated willingness to reach out to hamstring the litigation at an unusually early stage, for example by blocking the scheduled deposition of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.\n\nIn short, the power to choose judges is not merely a prize that the Republican Party has won by retaining control of the Senate. It is also a power that may help them retain the Senate, and therefore control of judicial appointments, into the farther future.\n\n\n\nRichard Primus is the Theodore J.

The gunman was later found dead at the scene.\n\nThe dead from the shooting Wednesday night also included 11 people inside the bar and a sheriff\u2019s sergeant who was the first officer inside the door, Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrific scene in there,\u201d Dean told a news conference in the parking lot of the Borderline Bar & Grill. \u201cThere\u2019s blood everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe massacre was the deadliest mass shooting in the United States since 17 classmates and teachers were gunned down at a Parkland, Florida school nine months ago. It also came less than two weeks after a gunman killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. That, it turn, closely followed the series of pipe bombs mailed to prominent Democrats, CNN and former officials critical of President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump said Thursday on Twitter that he has been \u201cfully briefed on the terrible shooting.\u201d He praised law enforcement, saying \u201cGreat bravery shown by police\u201d and said \u201cGod bless all of the victims and families of the victims.\u201d\n\nThe gunman at the dance bar was tall and wearing all black with a hood over his head and his face partly covered, witnesses told TV stations at the scene. He first fired on a person working the door, then appeared to open fire at random at the people inside, they said.\n\nMany more people had more minor injuries, including some that came from their attempt to flee, Dean said.\n\nSheriff\u2019s Sgt. Ron Helus and a passing highway patrolman were responding to several 911 calls when they arrived at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks at about 11:20 p.m., the sheriff said. They heard gunfire and went inside.\n\nHelus was immediately hit with multiple gunshots, Dean said. The highway patrolman cleared the perimeter and pulled Helus out, and then waited as a SWAT team and scores more officers arrived. Helus died early Thursday at a hospital.\n\nBy the time they entered the bar again the gunfire had stopped. They found 12 people dead inside, including the gunman.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear how the gunman died, and authorities do not yet know his name or have any idea of a motive, Dean said.\n\nIt was college night and country two-step lessons were being offered Wednesday at the Borderline, according to its website.\n\nThe bar, which includes a large dance hall with a stage and a pool room along with several smaller areas for eating and drinking, is a popular hangout for students from nearby California Lutheran University who enjoy country music. It\u2019s also close to several other universities including California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo, Pepperdine University in Malibu and Moorpark College in Moorpark.\n\nWhen the gunman entered, people screamed and fled to all corners of the bar, while a few people threw barstools through the windows and helped dozens to escape, witnesses said.\n\nVideo from the scene accessed by The Associated Press is punctuated by loud sounds of several rounds of gunfire. A terrified witness runs out. Police cars are seen arriving and an armed officer takes up position outside the bar. Three men rush out carrying a bloodied fourth individual. They try to stem the bleeding of what appears to be a gunshot wound.\n\nCole Knapp, a freshman at Moorpark College, said he was inside the bar when the shooting began but thought at first that it was \u201cjust someone with an M-80, just kind of playing a prank.\u201d\n\nThen he said he saw the shooter, wearing a black beanie and black hoodie and holding a small caliber handgun.\n\n\u201cI tried to get as many people to cover as I could,\u201d Knapp said. \u201cThere was an exit right next to me, so I went through that. That exit leads to a patio where people smoke. People out there didn\u2019t really know what was going on. There\u2019s a fence right there so I said, \u2019Everyone get over the fence as quickly as you can, and I followed them over.\u201d\n\nHe said a highway patrol officer was nearby who just happened to be pulling someone over.\n\n\u201cI screamed to him, \u2018There\u2019s a shooter in there!\u2019 He was kind of in disbelief, then saw that I was serious.\u201d\n\nKnapp said he has friends who haven\u2019t been accounted for.\n\nTayler Whitler, 19, said she was on the dance floor with her friends nearby when she saw the gunman shooting and heard screams to \u201cget down.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was really, really, really shocking,\u201d Whitler told KABC-TV as she stood with her father in the Borderline parking lot. \u201cIt looked like he knew what he was doing.\u201d\n\nSarah Rose DeSon told ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that she saw the shooter draw his gun.\n\n\u201cI dropped to the floor,\u201d she said. \u201cA friend yelled \u2018Everybody down!\u2019 We were hiding behind tables trying to keep ourselves covered.\u201d\n\nShootings of any kind are very rare in Thousand Oaks, a city of about 130,000 people about 40 miles west of Los Angeles, just across the county line.\n\nHelus was a 29-year veteran of the force with a wife and son and planned to retire in the coming year, said the sheriff, who choked back tears several times as he talked about the sergeant who was also his longtime friend.\n\n\u201cRon was a hardworking, dedicated sheriff\u2019s sergeant who was totally committed,\u201d Dean said, \u201cand tonight, as I told his wife, he died a hero because he went in to save lives.\u201d\n\n", "CUOMO\u2019s wish list \u2014 POT arrests plummet \u2014 The return of the Allure Group Presented by Airbnb\n\nCOME JANUARY, IN ALBANY, THERE\u2019S A NEW MAJORITY IN TOWN. That means everything the Democrats campaigned on \u2014 and everything Cuomo promised during the primary \u2014 is now suddenly a viable reality, whether the Democrats and Cuomo like it or not.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake? \u201cDemocrats' victory in the state Senate Tuesday will loosen the real estate industry's grip over the historically Republican chamber, months before the state\u2019s controversial rent laws are set to expire in June. The state's rent laws are particularly important for New York City lawmakers, where nearly 1 million rent-stabilized apartments are viewed by affordable housing advocates and Democratic politicians as a vital protection against soaring housing prices across the city,\u201d Janaki Chadha and Sally Goldenberg write. Then there\u2019s healthcare. As our Nick Niedzwiadek reports , full legalization of recreational marijuana is on the list. Increased protections for abortion rights and guaranteed insurance coverage without copays for FDA-approved contraceptives for both men and women are also on the table. Democratic control of the State Senate could mean the Legislature passes, and Cuomo signs, some form of congestion pricing.\n\nCuomo presented an everything-but-the-kitchen sink agenda in an interview yesterday. \u201cWhen asked... what he would like to see passed in the coming legislative session, the governor laid out a veritable Christmas list of progressive baubles, including codifying Roe v. Wade\u2019s protections in state law; more gun control and ethics laws; the Dream Act, which would allow for financial aid for undocumented students; and the Child Victims Act, which would extend the statute of limitations for survivors of certain kinds of sexual abuse. Perhaps most notably, Mr. Cuomo said he would close the so-called L.L.C. loophole, which allows almost unlimited amounts of cash to flow to campaigns \u2014 including his own \u2014 through multiple limited liability companies,\u201d Jesse McKinley and Shane Goldmacher report.\n\n\u2018My great frustration has been the inability to pass progressive measures that would have made a significant positive difference for the state and, as governor, bearing the burden of the failure of their passage,\u2019 Cuomo said. \u2018The Democratic Senate will liberate me from that frustration.\u2019\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s the outside possibility that the Democratic state Senate may usher in a session in which Mayor Bill de Blasio won\u2019t be ridiculed and tortured by the legislative process, bucking a trend that\u2019s happened every year since he tried, wholeheartedly and unsuccessfully, to flip the Senate blue back in 2014. Ever since, the Republican majority in the state Senate has gleefully exacted its revenge, forcing him to beg for even a single year extension of mayoral control of schools at a time, and threatening his legislative priorities. As Gloria reports , his wish list is modest, and for the foreseeable future, eminently plausible.\n\nThe mayor just wants rent control protections extended, some more money for the M.T.A., and he\u2019d like a little bit more mayoral control, please.\n\nNothing for Democrats to fear this year, except themselves.\n\nIT\u2019S THURSDAY.

The Associated Press says both are still too close to call. In Central New York\u2019s 22nd district, Republican firebrand Rep. Claudia Tenney has declined to concede to Democrat Anthony Brindisi after one of the tightest races in the country left her with 49.7 percent of the vote, compared to Brindisi\u2019s 50.3. The race drew four members of the Trump family to the district since July, including the president himself, and attracted a massive influx of cash from around the country. Tenney trails Brindisi by about 1,300 votes. According to the state Board of Elections, there are about 16,500 absentee ballots out for the district and at least 11,400 had been returned by Wednesday. Those ballots will not be opened and counted for at least a week\u2026 Meanwhile, in Western New York\u2019s 27th district, GOP Rep. Chris Collins , indicted on insider trading charges earlier this year, is clinging to a small lead as his Democratic challenger calls for a recount \u2014 after initially conceding the race.\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Anna Gronewold\n\n\u2014 \u201cIt's unclear whether the outstanding ballots can change Tuesday's results, which show Collins with a 2,692-vote lead (over Nate McMurray),\u201d reports the Buffalo News. \u201cIt was even unclear exactly how many ballots remained uncounted. The Collins campaign put that number at less than 9,500. A News estimate, based on data from all eight counties that have territory in the district, put the number of outstanding ballots at slightly more than 10,000. Collins' campaign consultant, Christopher M. Grant, dismissed the possibility that the outstanding ballots could reverse the results.\u201d Buckle in: Erie County doesn\u2019t start counting absentee votes until Nov. 20. Higher turnout may have boosted Collins .\n\nMEANWHILE, IN NY-11: \u201cWhat Max Rose Can Teach Democrats About Beating Republicans\u201d\u2014 \u201dHe is a bald white man. Mr. Rose grew up in Brooklyn and moved to Staten Island only a few years ago; the Republican incumbent he was up against, Dan Donovan, has been a Staten Islander for decades. I spent much of Election Day at a large mall in the borough, and when I spoke to people who had rejected Mr. Rose, they typically offered that it was because he was \u201cnot really from Staten Island.\u201d His pedigree might have alienated potential constituents, but his rhetoric did not. He offered a simple, unifying message that was progressive in substance but relatively neutral in its delivery: that the system is rigged to benefit special interests, that the little guy is getting stiffed over and over, that we need better infrastructure and stronger unions. He didn\u2019t fight a culture war; he talked about oppressively long commuting times and the opioid crisis, which has ravaged Staten Island, and he relentlessly made the point that his opponent had taken money from Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin. He managed a narrative that was both big picture and small bore.\u201d NYT\u2019s Ginia Bellafante\n\nWHAT ALBANY'S READING\n\nEND OF AN ERA ON LONG ISLAND \u2014 \u201cIn their heyday, they were called the Long Island Nine, the region\u2019s Republican state senators who for decades brought home millions of dollars for public schools and held sway over key state policies from breast cancer research and clean water to homeland security. They held that dominance \u2014 with a few interruptions \u2014 until 2015, and their legacy was further upended Tuesday night when Democrats won a clear majority of the Senate\u2019s 63 seats, including six of the Island\u2019s nine seats\u2026 The Long Island Nine famously held up adoption of state budgets if they didn\u2019t include enough school aid to hold down increases in school property taxes\u2026 At a news conference on Wednesday, five of the six victorious Democrats pledged to make suburban issues a priority of the new Senate Democratic majority, even though many of its members represent New York City.\u201d Newsday\u2019s James T.

Ultimately the fate of the $13 billion Gateway tunnel-and-bridge project continues to rest with the Trump administration. But the House of Representatives will soon be controlled by a party that is both friendlier to big cities and more inclined to use its subpoena and oversight authority to pressure the president to, at a minimum, let the project proceed. \"I think it means there's a much better chance that we get it done, because it's a top priority and because the president will be more likely to cut a deal to move it forward,\" said Hudson Valley U.S. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the only New York Democrat now on the House transportation committee. Certainly, as one person associated with the project told POLITICO, a Democratic House is better for the project than the federal government's existing political make-up.

In May, de Blasio announced that the NYPD would no longer arrest for low level marijuana possession \u2014 even if a person is smoking in public \u2014 following widespread criticism over racial disparities in arrests. Instead, the mayor said the police would issue a criminal summons. Arrests for low-level marijuana possession have decreased 90 percent from Sept. 2017 to Sept. 2018. Moreover, police are not increasing summonses to make up for the decline in arrests \u2014 summonses have decreased 26 percent over that same one-year period \u2014 meaning marijuana enforcement has gone down 58 percent in roughly a year's time.

Although the proposal , first reported by POLITICO, offers an \u201cimportant first step,\u201d there\u2019s more that needs to be done to strengthen the plan, said Transform Don\u2019t Trash \u2014 a coalition of environmental and labor advocates that includes the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, the Teamsters, New York Lawyers for the Public Interest and the Natural Resources Defense Council. Those groups have, for years, been the primary drivers for an overhaul of the city's private waste industry. The muted response highlights how the de Blasio administration is facing an uphill battle in finding the broad advocate support it likely needs to pass matching legislation in the City Council. Read more here .\n\n\u2014 From Danielle\u2019s scoop: Waste haulers will have to compete to service a single zone, giving the city greater authority to regulate the industry. The waste companies will have to meet several environmental, safety and labor standards to win a contract. The initiative will shut down the private industry's current open market system, where 50 of the 90 or so different carters can service a single neighborhood, leading some trucks to traverse all five boroughs in a single night. The long, tiresome routes, which can take 12 hours to complete, pose safety issues \u2014 private carters have been involved in seven fatal crashes since 2017, according to the city's proposal. The industry has also been the subject of a recent NYPD crackdown during which more than 100 trucks were found to have violations of some kind.

The firm and its partner Landpex Development are looking to build a 30-story rental property at 2266 Cropsey Avenue in Bath Beach, according to documents filed with the Department of Buildings on Wednesday. Allure and Landpex filed the permits under alternate addresses 2230 Cropsey Avenue and 1625 Shore Parkway. City records show a rectangular site, which runs the length of Cropsey Avenue between Bay 23rd Street and 23rd Avenue and is home to the King David Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation, a facility that provides long-term care for seniors. Allure told The Real Deal that the filing is not for the site of the senior facility. It is for the adjacent parking lot it also owns and a row of houses beyond. The company also said that the senior home will remain open, and that it plans to invest $10 million in the property.\u201d Read the story here .\n\n\u2014 \u201dAn Anonymous Hasidic Writer Talks Frankly About the Failing Hasidic School System\u201d \u2014 Jewish Daily Forward.\n\n\u2014 More than four years after Eric Garner died in a police chokehold, the inquiries into his death have gone nowhere.

Seth Moulton was already on a call talking strategy with other House members. The topic? You guessed it: options for House Speaker who are not Nancy Pelosi. The call lasted 90 minutes, according to a source with knowledge of the call.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhen it comes to Pelosi, Moulton is the Massachusetts delegation\u2019s chief defector. He\u2019s been outspoken in his belief that the House needs new leadership. But if Pelosi secures the votes she needs to become Speaker, which she says she will, Moulton could be on the outs for the next couple of years. Nationally, a number of newly-elected House members campaigned on ditching Pelosi as the party\u2019s top lawmaker. Here in Massachusetts, Congresswomen-elect Ayanna Pressley and Lori Trahan haven\u2019t said whether they will support Pelosi.\n\nHEALEY'S APPEAL \u2014 In some of the state's most liberal spots \u2014 Northampton, Somerville, Cambridge and Amherst \u2014 Attorney General Maura Healey got more than 90 percent of the vote on Tuesday. Not exactly a shocker. But what\u2018s worth paying attention to are the places where Healey was the top vote-getter and Gov. Charlie Baker also won.\n\nHealey topped the ticket in more than two dozen cities and towns that also went for Baker, including Gloucester, Lynn, Springfield and Worcester. So the same municipalities with an appetite for a Republican governor who keeps Trump at arm's length also overwhelmingly chose an attorney general who goes all in on opposing the president.\n\nWhile Baker won by being moderate and measured, Healey railed against the president and came out swinging for progressive causes and new candidates. Healey was among the first of the state's top Democrats to endorse Congresswoman-elect Ayanna Pressley in her primary race against Rep. Mike Capuano. That endorsement came at a time when Pressley was trailing in the polls and many others (former Gov. Deval Patrick, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, etc.) were siding with the old guard.\n\nHealey also threw support behind Tram Nguyen, who upset conservative state Rep. Jim Lyons, and progressive Andrea Harrington, who was elected district attorney in Berkshire County. It shows she's got a knack for sensing where going out on a limb will work. Somewhere it seems that might not have worked: Healey, a top Democrat, did not launch her own bid for governor this year.\n\nWHAT WARREN 2020 WOULD LOOK LIKE \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren's reelection win on Tuesday night is already providing a glimpse of what's to come if she runs for president in 2020. Expect to see a focus on women, aggressive organization and pushback against Donald Trump.\n\n\"The road to the Democrats winning back the House was on the shoulders of women, and most of them living in the suburbs,\" political consultant Mary Anne Marsh told me last night. \"They have led the resistance against Trump, from the March on Washington to deciding to become candidates, to giving money and volunteering, the Kavanaugh hearings, all of it. Women have had it and I think that's what Warren has tapped into.\"\n\nIn Massachusetts, Warren cleaned up in the state's most progressive areas \u2014 Greater Boston, Western Mass and the outer Cape and islands, and got 60 percent of the statewide vote against the closest candidate the state had to a Trump stand-in this cycle, Republican Geoff Diehl.\n\nWarren also saw success in many of the areas Gov. Charlie Baker won, which Marsh and others have attributed to unenrolled suburban women voters. Nationally, Republicans are fretting about their poor performance among suburban women in some districts.\n\n\"That doesn't mean she's going to be successful, but when you look at this map, it's the road map,\" Marsh said.\n\nListening to Warren's victory speech, likely as much a parlay to 2020 as it was closure on the 2018 race, she tapped into her struggle as a young mother of two trying to balance parenthood and a career and her determination to take on Trump.\n\n\"When you listen to that speech last night, that's who she was appealing to. You're starting to see the rationale she's putting forth and what kind of candidate she would be,\" Marsh said.\n\nHave a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

Massachusetts politicians have hardly been absent from the national stage, but the Bay State's past dominance of the House has waned since the days when the late Tip O'Neill, a Cambridge Democrat, presided over the chamber in the 1980s.

Republicans can\u2019t agree on how to deal with Trump\n\nBy Matt Friedman ( mfriedman@politico.com ; @mattfriedmannj )\n\nIt was probably a clue when Tom MacArthur left his election night party without saying anything, while Andy Kim came out to to talk to his supporters.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nYesterday, Burlington County finally counted thousands of vote-by-mail ballots. MacArthur\u2019s 2,000+ vote lead flipped. Now Kim\u2019s leading by a couple thousand votes. And last night, Kim declared victory .\n\nIt\u2019s far from official yet, even if it\u2019s looking that way. Mail-in ballots that arrive by today still have to be counted as long as they\u2019re postmarked by Tuesday. And there are thousands more provisional ballots to count.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to see how MacArthur makes up the margin, unless more uncounted votes are unexpectedly concentrated in deep red Ocean County. For now, he\u2019s not conceding. But Democrats are confident that the outstanding votes don\u2019t give MacArthur a path.\n\nEven if MacArthur pulls off a miracle, it\u2019s clear he misread his district by standing so prominently with Trump and lending his name and insurance expertise to the Obamacare repeal attempt. Then again, Leonard Lance read his district perfectly and still lost.\n\nJust two years ago, New Jersey had six Republicans and six Democrats in its House delegation. If Kim did indeed win, come January it will be represented by just one Republican and 11 Democrats.\n\nI do think Republicans will eventually win back some House seats in New Jersey. But maybe not with Trump as president.\n\nWHERE\u2019S MURPHY?

The party, he said, needs to clearly and forcefully repudiate the kind of rhetoric on which President Donald Trump closed the election. \u201cTrump\u2019s rhetoric created an atmosphere that unified the opposition, meaning that he got people so mad that they reacted to his divisive language,\u201c Bramnick said. \u201cEven a moderate like [Republican Senate nominee] Bob Hugin or a moderate like [U.S. Rep.] Leonard Lance couldn\u2019t overcome the opposition that was reacting to this divisive environment created by the president in New Jersey.\u201c\n\nThe problem for Bramnick is that his sentiment is far from universal among Garden State Republicans. The party\u2019s state chairman and at least one pro-Trump state lawmaker strongly disagree with his assessment of the president. Increasingly, GOP strength is being marginalized to rural areas in a deep blue state dominated by cities and suburbs. At the same time, Democrats have increased their party registration advantage over Republicans to more than 930,000 voters. Come January, the state GOP, already with little power in Trenton, will have its smallest delegation in the House of Representatives in more than 100 years as it watches once solid Republican areas shift to the Democrats.

Cory Booker on Wednesday called Attorney General Jeff Sessions' dismissal \u2018an alarming development\u2019 and warned that curtailing the probe into possible collusion between President Donald Trump's campaign and Russian officials could lead to \u2018a constitutional crisis.\u2019 The investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller has been overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, but the acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, could take over supervision and limit the scope of the probe. Whitaker took over the Justice Department Wednesday as Trump requested and obtained the ... resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions a day after the midterm elections. \u2018Jeff Sessions' firing at the hands of the president is an alarming development that brings us one step closer to a constitutional crisis,\u2019 said Booker, D-N.J.\u201d Read the report\n\nDON\u2019T BLOW IT NOW BY EATING POP ROCKS WITH PEPSI, MIKIE \u2014\u201dIn Jersey, Sherrill is the star in a blue tsunami,\u201d by The Star-Ledger\u2019s Tom Moran: \u201cThe margins were remarkable. Mikie Sherrill, the rock star of the evening, crushed her Republican opponent by 13 points in a district that Trump won two years ago. She is 46, and if she plays her cards right, is destined to become the most powerful woman in New Jersey politics since Gov. Christie Whitman \u2026 If Democrats want to lose, a heavy dose of moral condescension would help, driving a message that every last Trump supporter is a bigot. I don't think New Jersey Democrats are that stupid. And that brings me back to Sherrill, the star of the night. Sherrill's strategy was to run as herself, a centrist who is offended by what Trump is doing to the country, a patriot who flew Navy helicopters in the Mideast before a second career as a federal prosecutor in Newark. Her opponent, Assemblyman Jay Webber, R-Morris, ran as a mini-Trump. He lied about Sherrill over and over, inventing stuff like the charge that she wanted to eliminate ICE. But when Sherrill debated him, she answered not with anger, but with a steely resolve, and a relentless appeal to common ground.\u201d Read the column\n\n\u2014\u201cHow Mikie Sherrill won,\u201d by The Record\u2019s Bruce Lowry: \u201cWhat always made Mikie Sherrill such an attractive congressional candidate was the part of her resume that included Naval Academy graduate, and Navy helicopter pilot. What carried her across the finish line, however, was not the Navy, but rather \u201cMikie\u2019s Army\u201d of volunteers that spread its wings and kept growing, and that helped her campaign continue to build momentum all the way to the end, by which time Sherrill, a moderate Democrat who set records for congressional fund-raising, had overwhelmed her opponent, Republican Assemblyman Jay Webber. The impressive thing about \u201cMikie\u2019s Army\u201d is that its ranks swelled enough to include a wide array of volunteers, from a trio of middle-aged Essex County women who\u2019d grown weary of former Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, a so-called \u201cRockefeller Republican\u201d who\u2019d lost touch; to energized teen-aged girls from Chatham High School who rushed to join the Sherrill campaign even though they couldn\u2019t vote; to a Parsippany native who described himself as a \u201cnominal independent\u201d who\u2019d been up since 5 a.m. on Election Day, he said, working as an \u201celection challenger\u201d at Brooklawn Junior High School.\u201d Read the column\n\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS SAY THEY\u2019LL PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY BUT THEY DON\u2019T WANT ANYONE TO RETIRE \u2014 \u201cHow the House fell: Republican chaos and Democratic focus,\u201d by The New York Times\u2019 Jonathan Martin: \u201cRepresentative Ed Royce of California was not the first Republican to decide he would not run for re-election in 2018. But his announcement, in January, was the warning bell that tolled most ominously for Republican leaders \u2026 Within weeks, Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee, followed suit.

He sniped at Mr. Ross, who quit the day Mr. Ryan retired: \u2018He saw the cover of Paul retiring, and he slid right under it.\u2019 Mr. LoBiondo suggested he could change his mind and run for re-election, provided he could hang on to the chairmanship of a congressional subcommittee he was scheduled to relinquish. Republican leaders assented, but it was not enough. \u2018He got what he said he wanted, and he still retired,\u2019 Mr. Stivers said.\u201d Read the report\n\n\u2014\u201cA Trump-Fueled \u2018Wipeout\u2019 for House Republicans in Northeast\u201d Read the report\n\nWHAT $36 MILLION GETS YOU \u2014 \u201cMenendez by the numbers,\u201d by New Jersey Globe\u2019s David Wildstein: \u201cIn the end, Hugin\u2019s 44% was about what a Republican U.S. Senate candidate typically receives.

Ultimately the fate of the $13 billion Gateway tunnel-and-bridge project continues to rest with the Trump administration. But the House of Representatives will soon be controlled by a party that is both friendlier to big cities and more inclined to use its subpoena and oversight authority to pressure the president to, at a minimum, let the project proceed. \"I'm told my folks who know a lot better than I do ... that he plays the hand he's been dealt,\" Gov.

Their two victories ensure the Democrats will take majority control of the five-member Freeholder Board for the first time in more than 40 years. Former Democratic Freeholder Joanne Schwartz also was elected to the county Clerk post over Republican incumbent Tim Tyler. While the victories represented a historic moment for the party, Youngkin generated controversy Tuesday night when he announced he planned to serve in the seat.

McDonald: \u201cHudson County Democrats spent months fretting about U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez's chances this year, only to have all their fears vanish in an instant on Tuesday night. Poof. Many of them didn't even get to experience the euphoria political supporters feel when they're stuck in a ballroom together awaiting results and watch them flash across a monitor. The televisions at the Menendez party on the second floor of the W hotel in Hoboken were tuned to CNN, which did not mention the New Jersey senate race until 9:45. The race had been called by others more than an hour earlier, when some of Menendez's top allies weren't in the room \u2026 The comparative closeness of the Menendez-Hugin contest had Democrats in Hudson County antsy well into the fall that they might lose their guy in the U.S. Senate the same year they lost the state Assembly speakership and two years after losing the chance to nab the governor's mansion. Not that they'd ever admit that publicly.

Wade may be coming sooner than many expected. Health Care Here come the Roe v. Wade challenges The measures are the latest salvos in a multiyear crusade by anti-abortion groups to enact state laws.\n\nTwo states on Tuesday approved ballot initiatives to limit or ban access to abortion, part of a wave of actions that could accelerate a Roe v. Wade challenge before the Supreme Court\u2019s new conservative majority.\n\nAlabama became the first state in the nation to enact what opponents call a \u201cpersonhood clause\u201d in its constitution, recognizing \u201cthe rights of unborn children, including the right to life.\u201d That makes it possible for the state to ban abortion entirely if Roe v. Wade is overturned. The measure includes no exemptions for abortion in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is at risk. While other states have enacted \u201cright to life\u201d and \u201cpersonhood\u201d language, none have gone as far as Alabama\u2019s constitutional amendment.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWest Virginians approved a measure stripping from the state constitution any abortion rights protections. It also cuts off Medicaid funding for abortions and sets a jail sentence of three to 10 years for anyone who performs or receives the procedure \u2014 a rare move to criminalize abortion for both the pregnant woman and the health care provider.\n\nThe measures are the latest salvos in a multiyear crusade by anti-abortion groups to enact state laws that could present a legal challenge to Roe vs. Wade when the moment is right \u2014 and, with conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh freshly installed on the Supreme Court, that moment may be coming sooner than many expected.\n\n\u201cThis is a years long strategy that\u2019s being put in place to set up those constitutions so that abortion restrictions will be upheld,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.\n\nPOLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nAside from the funding restriction, which can be enacted immediately, the measures are largely designed to only take effect if Roe v. Wade is overturned, Nash said. If the federal right to an abortion goes, then states will be the ones in charge of setting the restrictions \u2014 or allowing it. In West Virginia and Alabama, the new constitutional language will make it easier for state lawmakers to ban or at least restrict abortion.\n\nBuoyed by Tuesday\u2019s results, more states may try to pass similar measures, though they could face a tough road. Attempts in recent years to pass personhood amendments in Colorado, Mississippi and North Dakota have crashed and burned.\n\nAt least two states have already contacted the group Americans United for Life indicating interest in similar amendment language to clarify there isn\u2019t a constitutional right to an abortion in their state, similar to what West Virginia and Alabama did, according to Steven Aden, Americans United for Life chief legal officer and general counsel. The states, which he declined to name, contacted AUL in the lead-up to the midterm elections.\n\nThe measures\u2019 passage in Alabama and West Virginia wasn\u2019t a given.\n\nSeveral national organizations poured money and labor into both sides of the campaigns in West Virginia. On the pro-abortion rights side, the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood and other progressive groups mobilized unsuccessfully to defeat the measure. Aware that the majority of West Virginians are opposed to abortion, the coalition had crafted a message warning of \u201cgovernment overreach into personal medical decisions.\u201d\n\nNow, they say they are exploring their options going forward, including how to aid low-income women likely to be the hardest hit by the loss of public funding for abortion procedures.\n\n\u201cThis will disproportionately impact women who already face enough barriers to health care,\u201d says coalition spokesperson Julie Warden. \u201cWe refuse to let politicians further strip West Virginians of their right to safe, affordable abortion care.\u201d\n\nThe anti-abortion organization Susan B. Anthony List dropped half a million dollars on the West Virginia initiative, funding television, radio and digital advertising and a mailer campaign. The group\u2019s national spokeswoman Mallory Quigley said that the measure\u2019s success, coinciding with Democrats holding onto a vulnerable Senate seat in the state, show the crossover appeal of restricting abortion rights.\n\n\u201cThis was an issue pro-life West Virginians, regardless of party, could agree on,\u201d she said, arguing that if Sen. Joe Manchin had not voted to confirm Kavanaugh \u2014 who is widely expected to be a foe of abortion rights on the high court \u2014 \u201cit would have been a very different story.\u201d Manchin was one of the few vulnerable Senate Democrats reelected from a state Donald Trump carried in 2016.\n\nIn Alabama, groups working to defeat the measure \u2014 Alabama for Healthy Families and Alabama Students Voting No on Amendment 2 \u2014 raised more than $925,000, significantly outspending the nearly $4,000 the Alliance for Pro-Life Alabama raised. Still, the conservative state voted 59 percent to 41 percent in favor.\n\n\u201cThese measures were clearly designed to mislead voters and will now undermine a woman\u2019s right to access to safe, legal abortion,\u201d Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement.\n\nAbortion rights advocates say, however, that Tuesday\u2019s elections weren't all grim for them, pointing to just how hotly contested congressional and governors races were in conservative states.\n\nIn West Virginia, the ballot measure passed by a slim majority. It was backed by 52 percent of voters.\n\nAnd a third ballot initiative to roll back abortion rights was decisively defeated in Oregon, a widely expected outcome in the progressive state. The measure would have effectively cut off public funding for abortions, blocking access to residents enrolled in Medicaid and state and municipal employee health plans.\n\nSome in the anti-abortion movement were gearing up for a landscape favoring their position even before Kavanaugh joined the court. In state legislatures across the country, lawmakers have proposed some of the most restrictive abortion laws over the past few years \u2014 an effort to spark court challenges that make their way to the high court, and effectively overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nIn Iowa, Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds was reelected Tuesday after abortion became a flashpoint in her campaign when she signed off on the most restrictive abortion law in the country. The law would prohibit the procedure after a heartbeat is detected.\n\nThere are lawsuits essentially \u201c'right at the court's front door,\u201d Nash said.\n\nIn Alabama, the state\u2019s attorney general plans to ask the Supreme Court to review a ruling upholding a permanent injunction blocking the state from prohibiting the most commonly used second trimester abortion procedure, The Associated Press reported.\n\nAnd in Indiana, the state has asked the Supreme Court to consider another abortion measure on whether a woman can be banned from receiving an abortion due to the fetus' race, gender or potential disabilities.\n\n\u201cThe states have been setting up for a Supreme Court victory since before Kavanaugh,\u201d said The Very Rev. Katherine H. Ragsdale, interim president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve known that they had a chance, so they've been setting up, and it\u2019s appalling. It\u2019s just horrifying and frightening, the idea about what could be happening to women if Roe gets overturned.\u201d\n\nThe new state constitutional amendments in West Virginia and Alabama will be much more difficult to overturn and harder to challenge in court than anti-abortion bills passed by state legislatures. Historically, voters have been hesitant to approve them for that reason.\n\nThough Tennessee did successfully pass an amendment to strip abortion rights out of the state constitution in 2014, attempts in recent years to pass personhood amendments in Colorado, Mississippi and North Dakota have crashed and burned. The Supreme Court announcement last month that it would not hear a challenge to Tennessee's anti-abortion constitutional amendment further fueled anticipation that Alabama and West Virginia's initiatives could find a friendly reception at the high court.\n\nBut women\u2019s health experts say the tide may have turned this year.\n\n\u201cI do think that just given the attention on the U.S. Supreme Court around abortion rights and given that both of these ballot initiatives were successful that other conservative states would look to their own constitutions to see how they could roll back abortion rights,\u201d Nash said.", "High-profile Democrats eyeing 2020, including Sen.

But many candidates will likely wait to make a formal announcement until January, allowing them to avoid the doldrums of the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, while taking advantage of a full fundraising quarter before reporting their initial hauls next spring.\n\nThat first fundraising number, perhaps more than early polls, will serve as a prominent marker of viability in the 2020 campaign.\n\nSome candidates may wait longer into 2019, searching for an opening in the early field as it thins. Following the 2006 midterm elections, Vilsack announced his candidacy almost immediately but failed to gain traction. He recalled lasting \"all of two months.\u201d\n\nAnd Biden, who leads Democratic contenders in initial polling, told MSNBC reporters on Election Day that if he runs, even January would be \u201ctoo early\u201d to announce a campaign.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s going to be in New Hampshire before Christmas this year saying they\u2019re running for president,\u201d said Bob Mulholland, a Democratic National Committee member from California, where a handful of potential presidential candidates, including Sen.

Rick Scott in early 2011. | Getty The political sway of Florida's 1.5M voting felons is up for grabs, experts say\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 A Florida constitutional amendment that will restore voting rights to roughly 1.5 million Floridians with felony convictions may have a significant impact on future elections in the Sunshine State \u2014 but it's far from clear which party will benefit most.\n\nThe ballot question passed with more than 64 percent of the vote, and even heavier support in highly populated Democratic strongholds like Broward County, where criminal justice reforms might be seen as an easier sell. But it also received 55 percent of the vote in Collier and Lee counties, which make up the deepest red corner of the state. The amendment only needed 60 percent of the vote to pass.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAllison DeFoor, one of the campaign organizer's behind the amendment, said that many observers connect the disproportionate number of blacks facing criminal conviction with the racial makeup of the state\u2019s eligible felons. For instance, the NAACP has reported that blacks were five times as likely to be incarcerated as whites. But a 2016 report by the Washington-based Sentencing Project found that African Americans make up only 28 percent of the population eligible for the restoration of voting rights in Florida.\n\n\u201cMost people think they\u2019re black and they\u2019ll vote Democrat,\u201d said DeFoor, who is the founding chairman of the Project on Accountable Justice at Florida State University. \u201cBut no, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\nFlorida's statewide races were mostly won by Republicans on Tuesday night.\n\nDeFoor said that the majority of felons who have had their rights restored in Florida registered as independent or Republican.\n\n\u201cThe dirty little secret of all of this is the research I saw is that they tend to register Republican or independent,\u201d he said.\n\nThe amendment guarantees the automatic restoration of voting rights for almost anyone with a felony conviction who has completed the terms of a criminal sentence. People convicted of murder or felony sex offenses will remain subject to a lengthy review process implemented by Gov. Rick Scott in early 2011.\n\nFlorida Rights Restoration Coalition Political Director Neil Volz orchestrated the collection of the 766,200 petition signatures that were required to make the ballot. He said people he met during the petition process who wanted their rights restored hadn\u2019t given a political party any thought.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, the answer is always the same,\u201d Volz said. \u201cThey think they\u2019re not allowed to be a Republican or a Democrat \u2014 I\u2019m not allowed to sit in that seat and have that type of perspective.\u201d\n\nVolz has been a Republican for 25 years and resides in Fort Myers, which is in Republican-rich Lee County. He was a congressional staffer-turned $500-an-hour lobbyist in Washington when he was arrested by the FBI as it investigated a 2006 corruption scandal involving former U.S. Rep. Bob Ney. He was convicted of felony conspiracy and sentenced to probation.\n\n\u201cThis petition process was the first chance for people to start talking about this issue,\u201d Volz said. \u201cYou tell them that 70 percent of the people who would become \u2018returning citizens\u2019 as we say and they\u2019re blown away.\"\n\n\u201cMost people have this vision of what a felon looks like and they didn\u2019t ever know someone like a librarian may be one of them,\u201d he said.\n\nFlorida previously offered automatic restoration of voting rights under former Gov. Charlie Crist, but Scott replaced that program with his own review process in March 2011. Tallahassee federal court Judge Mark Walker ruled in February of this year that Scott\u2019s process violated the First Amendment, but that opinion was given a temporary stay by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cIf any one of these citizens wishes to earn back their fundamental right to vote, they must plod through a gauntlet of constitutionally infirm hurdles,\u201d Walker wrote in his ruling. \u201cNo more.\u201d\n\nMore than 22,000 people await review by the state Clemency Board, which includes Scott, state Attorney General Pam Bondi, Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis. The board meets four times a year in the state Capitol and applicants regularly travel to Tallahassee from across the state to plead their cases. Nicole Porter, advocacy director at the Sentencing Project, said felons whose crimes were too serious to qualify for Amendment 4 are still subject to Scott\u2019s process.\n\nPorter also said no data exists that indicates the 1.5 million eligible felons \u2014 about 8 percent of the state\u2019s total voting population \u2014 will boost the ranks of a political party one way or another.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no data or report that has told anyone how disenfranchised people will vote,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say if they\u2019ll register to vote in the first place.\u201d\n\nVolz said the assumption that blacks made up most of the felon population roots back to the racial undertones of this year\u2019s midterm election in Florida, which carried over from the 2016 presidential election won by President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThis goes back to the Jim Crow days when everything was just assumed to be fact,\u201d Volz said. \u201cAnd this is why this phase of the amendment, we\u2019re going to talk to each other and learn who might be getting another chance to vote.\u201d", "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer just endured a brutal midterm election, but now he\u2019s in for an equally challenging task: managing the half-dozen or more presidential hopefuls in his caucus jockeying for position. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images Congress Coming soon to the Senate: A 2020 Democratic brawl At least a half-dozen senators are likely to run, a dynamic that Mitch McConnell jokingly said will be 'fun to watch.'\n\nThe biggest 2020 campaign stage isn\u2019t Iowa or New Hampshire.

In 2016, McConnell had to herd his own bunch of ambitious senators running for president.\n\nBut Murphy, a young senator from Connecticut, predicted that no matter how the presidential maneuvering shakes out, Democrats wouldn\u2019t face the internal tension that the Senate GOP presidential hopefuls sparked in the run-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet who\u2019s going to run for president in the caucus, but we don\u2019t have any Ted Cruzes in our caucus,\u201d Murphy said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t have people in our caucus who are going to intentionally do damage to their colleagues in order to promote themselves or their presidential campaigns.\u201d\n\nSchumer made the same case on Wednesday, insisting that his \u201ccaucus has shown tremendous unity\u201d that he expects to continue.\n\nThe many governors, mayors and House members eyeing the White House will have a hard time beating the Senate floor as a platform. Already several Democratic senators have taken the stage to remind the public of their ambitions: Harris voted against a compromise immigration bill in February, blindsiding liberal colleagues who expected her to join them in the \u201cyes\u201d camp. Shortly after that, Warren alienated moderate colleagues by attacking their support of bank deregulation.\n\nThe liberals\u2019 first chance to make a splash without worrying about red-state Democrats is coming soon. On Dec. 7, government funding expires, and Trump is picking a big fight over at least $5 billion in border wall funding. The battle offers the first post-midterm opportunity to take on Trump directly, and Democrats are already bracing for brutal conflict on the Senate floor and behind closed doors in their caucus meetings.\n\nOne aide working for a potential presidential candidate wondered, however, whether any Democratic senator would be prepared to undercut Schumer\u2019s position in year-end spending talks: \u201cEveryone\u2019s going to run against D.C.,\u201d the aide said. \u201cBut is anyone going to run against [Democratic] leadership?\u201d\n\nThe potential for intraparty animosity is real. Most Democrats, save for Harris and two New Mexico senators, earlier this year supported $25 billion in border wall money in exchange for protecting some young immigrants. With Tester and other at-risk Democrats\u2019 races now over, White House aspirants might be in less of a mood to compromise and more inclined to push their colleagues to the left.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a real opening salvo on this question, at least as far as the presidentials are going to play it, in December,\u201d said a senior Democratic aide. This staffer did not, for now, expect high-profile liberals to cause a government shutdown, predicting they would not deploy \u201cthe full levels of their power\u201d \u2014 in other words, block Schumer from the 60 votes he\u2019ll need to avoid a partial shutdown \u2014 \u201cbut make damn clear what their position is.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic senators eyeing White House bids have some chits to cash in with red-state Democrats they campaigned for. Unfortunately for them, though, at least three of those incumbents lost.\n\nHarris sent more than $9 million to Democratic candidates and committees this cycle, while Warren had raised and donated $8 million as of late October, according to their offices. Booker bolstered his own $7 million-plus in fundraising for the party\u2019s organizations with appearances on behalf of 10 out of 12 Democratic Senate candidates in closely contested races.\n\nWarren held one-on-one meetings with 49 Democratic candidates for House, Senate, governor or state-level offices in early presidential states as of early October, according to tallies provided to Politico.\n\nGillibrand focused on female candidates, who she supported through a PAC dubbed Off the Sidelines, backing a list of nearly 100 hopefuls, including some centrists. Merkley has raised and contributed close to $1 million to the party\u2019s candidates and committees, according to his office. And Murphy transferred and raised $500,000 for the Democratic campaign committee.\n\nAfter several moderate Democrats went down Tuesday, some of the remaining ones are worries about the dynamics within the conference heading toward 2020.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about what the Senate looks like right now,\u201d Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said in a recent interview, referring to the plethora of likely presidential candidates.\n\nOne thing that has changed, most Democrats privately admit, is moderates\u2019 waning leverage to force the rest of their party to sidestep a potential government shutdown. When an impasse over immigration forced a brief partial closure in January, Democratic leaders abandoned their position under pressure from centrists to back down.\n\nAs prominent a stage as the Senate is for White House hopefuls, it by no means guarantees success. For Barack Obama, it worked out great. For the crop of Republicans who ran in 2016 \u2014 including Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul \u2014 not so much.\n\nThe three of them generated made-for-TV moments in the run-up to their bids. Paul forced an expiration of the PATRIOT Act, Rubio tried to sink the nuclear deal with Iran, and Cruz repeatedly went after McConnell, even calling him a liar. It was a management nightmare for McConnell.\n\nBut after maneuvering for years to generate buzz from inside the Senate, all three were trampled by Trump in the 2016 primaries.\n\nRepublicans wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the same thing happen to the Senate Democratic presidential caucus.\n\n\u201cThey have lots of candidates,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very similar.\u201d\n\n", "The problem for Bramnick is that his sentiment is far from universal among Garden State Republicans. | Mel Evans/AP Photo New Jersey Republicans debate how to handle Trump after major losses\n\nLooking over the aftermath of Tuesday night\u2019s bloodbath for the New Jersey GOP, Assembly Republican leader Jon Bramnick thinks he has a fix.\n\nThe party, he said, needs to clearly and forcefully repudiate the kind of rhetoric on which President Donald Trump closed the election.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s rhetoric created an atmosphere that unified the opposition, meaning that he got people so mad that they reacted to his divisive language,\u201c Bramnick said. \u201cEven a moderate like [Republican Senate nominee] Bob Hugin or a moderate like [U.S. Rep.] Leonard Lance couldn\u2019t overcome the opposition that was reacting to this divisive environment created by the president in New Jersey.\u201c\n\nThe problem for Bramnick is that his sentiment is far from universal among Garden State Republicans. The party\u2019s state chairman and at least one pro-Trump state lawmaker strongly disagree with his assessment of the president.\n\nIncreasingly, GOP strength is being marginalized to rural areas in a deep blue state dominated by cities and suburbs. At the same time, Democrats have increased their party registration advantage over Republicans to more than 930,000 voters.\n\nCome January, the state GOP, already with little power in Trenton, will have its smallest delegation in the House of Representatives in more than 100 years as it watches once solid Republican areas shift to the Democrats. At most, the 12-member delegation will have just two Republicans.\n\nNew Jersey Republicans lost at least three House seats that had been in their hands for decades. Another one of their incumbents, pro-Trump Rep. Tom MacArthur, trails Democrat Andy Kim by about 2,600 votes in the 3rd Congressional District, a race that remains too close to call, although Kim declared victory Wednesday evening.\n\nThe news wasn\u2019t any better at the local level, where Republicans lost control of the Burlington County freeholder board and Democrats won two freeholder seats in Somerset County, breaking a 40-year losing streak.\n\nAt the state level, the party lost a significant number of seats in the Statehouse during Republican Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s eight years in office.\n\nThere\u2019s no question anti-Trump anger drove the Democratic wave on Tuesday, especially in suburban areas like Somerset County that were, for generations, home to moderate Republicans in the mold of Tom Kean and Christie Whitman.\n\n\u201cHe who shall not be named was very helpful throughout the entire cycle. I have to say thanks to that guy, because we\u2019re energized,\u201d Somerset County Democratic Chairwoman Peg Schaffer said in a clear reference to the president.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201csummer White House\u201d \u2014 the Trump National Golf Club \u2014 is located in Bedminster, Somerset County, and \u201cevery time he came into Somerset county, more people got engaged,\u201d Schaffer said.\n\nBedminster is also part of the 7th Congressional District, where Rep. Leonard Lance, a moderate Republican who has held the seat for nearly a decade, was defeated Tuesday by Democrat Tom Malinowski.\n\nBramnick said the Republican Party can still offer a message with a wide appeal, as long as it isn\u2019t being drowned out by divisive rhetoric \u2014 though Bramnick wouldn\u2019t get into specific issues the president has brought up. He said wants the party to focus attention on the economy, and most of, all lowering the state\u2019s notoriously high taxes\n\n\u201cEach election stands on its own merits. Clearly, there\u2019s a map that\u2019s difficult. In an environment where the number of Democrats has grown statewide, I\u2019ve got challenges,\u201d Bramnick said. \u201cBut one thing I will not let stand in my way is divisive rhetoric. These other issues of demographic changes or issues involving politics of that year, I can deal with that. But I don\u2019t want my message drowned out. And I can tell you that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201c\n\nBut pro-Trump Republicans, while a relatively small minority in New Jersey, are still an influential force in the state GOP. In the state\u2019s rural corners, like South Jersey\u2019s largely rural 2nd Congressional District, Trump remains popular.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 2nd District\u2019s Republican congressional candidate, Seth Grossman, came within just six points of Democrat Jeff Van Drew despite being massively out-funded. Grossman, who ran on a pro-Trump message, lost support from the national GOP for posting a white supremacist article on social media. But the eight county Republican committees that make up the district all stuck with him.\n\nEven so, the Republican candidates who embraced Trump \u2014 and even those who sought distance from him \u2014 all had a bad night.\n\nNew Jersey Republican State Chairman Doug Steinhardt did not return a phone call seeking comment on Wednesday. But when Bramnick criticized Trump after Republicans lost last year\u2019s gubernatorial election, along with some state legislative seats, Steinhardt issued a statement saying Bramnick spoke \u201cas an individual and not on behalf of the NJGOP.\u201d\n\nState Sen. Michael Doherty (R-Warren), a pro-Trump Republican from a rural North Jersey district, put the blame for New Jersey\u2019s losses on Bramnick\u2019s strategy.\n\n\u201cWe have had Jon Bramnick\u2019s strategy in play in New Jersey for the last two-and-a-half years, where party chairmen and elected officials run away from Trump as quickly as possible. Never associate with Trump. Disassociate with Trump,\u201d Doherty said Wednesday. \u201cSo for folks to say here on November 7, 2018, after we\u2019ve had one of the worst defeats in New Jersey since the Watergate era, we have tried their strategy for the last two-and-a-half years. I\u2019ve seen it with my own eyes. I\u2019ve gone to Republican events where there\u2019s not one Trump sign anywhere.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on the battlefield, you have to be unified, you have to stick together, you have to have a mission, a goal, you have to head in a certain direction,\u201d said Doherty, a West Point graduate. \u201cAnd this year in New Jersey, in the Republican army, the soldiers were scattered.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the conundrum for the New Jersey GOP.\n\nWhile being pro-Trump is a key to motivating the base, there just aren\u2019t enough rural areas of the state to make the GOP anything but a minority party.\n\n\u201cIn a sense, they\u2019re both right,\u201d said Micah Rasmussen, director Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University. \u201cHowever, I will say that I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s enough votes in the rural parts of the state to justify Doherty\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cIf you are going to take any kind of a run at all at the majority of voters in this state, you\u2019ve got to take the Bramnick strategy,\u201d said Rasmussen, who spent several years as an Assembly Democratic staffer. \u201c It\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201c", "Trump made Florida\u2019s 2018 midterm a referendum on his presidency by getting so aggressively involved in the races. | AP Photo Florida becomes 'Trump Country'\n\nMIAMI \u2014 Florida solidified its status as Trump Country this week, reinvigorating Republicans and dispiriting Democrats as the consummate swing state sets the stage for a possible three-peat in 2020.\n\n\u201cI'm calling this right now: Unless Trump is getting taken down easily in his re-election, he is winning Florida in 2020. It's not a tossup. It's Lean-R,\u201d said Matt Isbell, a Democratic data analyst based in Florida. \u201cThe Florida election map is changing under Trump. It\u2019s the data.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIsbell said a variety of factors that increasingly favor Republicans in Florida became clear Tuesday, chiefly the \u201cconsolidation of the conservative and white vote in Florida that started in 2016 and continued Tuesday.\u201c It\u2019s not just retirees voting Republican.\n\n\u201cVoters in white working-class areas are becoming more conservative \u2014 and hard-line conservative \u2014 and more Republican-aligned,\u201d Isbell said. \u201c And that\u2019s erasing Democratic improvement in the suburbs.\u201d\n\nLike other Democrats, Isbell acknowledges that he\u2019s having an emotional reaction to Tuesday\u2019s election, which shocked the party almost as much as Trump\u2019s 2016 win.\n\nThis time, Democrats were supposed to get even. This time, Florida was supposed to be washed with a blue wave. This time, voters were supposed to do what they normally do: punish the party of the president in power during his first midterm. This time, President Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration rhetoric was supposed to help attract more independents and more Hispanics to the polls to reject his party.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe Democratic party\u2019s fresh new face, Andrew Gillum, likely lost to Trump-backed Ron DeSantis. And 18-year incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson \u2014 the lone statewide elected Democrat \u2014 trailed Trump-backed Gov. Rick Scott. That race, however, is so close it\u2019s headed to a recount. The governor\u2019s race is precariously close as well to recount territory. The race for state agriculture commissioner will also go to a recount, as will a state Senate race and two state House races.\n\nThe close election margins, however, do give Democrats some hope. After all, the 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016 top-of-the-ticket races were decided by 1.2 percentage points or fewer. The margins in the 2018 races are even tighter.\n\nIt\u2019s also Florida, so anything can happen. And the proportion of registered Democrats, 37 percent, exceeds that of Republicans by two points.\n\nRyan Tyson, vice president of political operations for Republican-leaning Associated Industries of Florida, said the state is still purple and, to Republicans, the Florida Democratic Party is a threat.\n\n\u201cThis is a diverse state. It changes year to year. Candidates matter,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cThe party is at a financial disadvantage. It\u2019s at a power disadvantage. And yet they\u2019re keeping elections close.\u201d\n\nIf the governor\u2019s race does not go to a recount and if Scott holds on to his winning margin, Florida for the first time since Reconstruction will have no statewide elected Democrats. Republicans also control the Florida House and Senate, giving Democrats no top offices in the state to wield influence or command campaign contributions to help rebuild a party that was already struggling before Tuesday.\n\nWith Democrats completely out of power and Republicans in complete control, Trump could meet with less resistance in the Sunshine State on the 2020 campaign trail.\n\nIn recent years, Florida played a crucial firewall role in the Electoral College for Democrats. Typically, Democrats would win two of the four largest states, California and New York, while Republicans won Texas. The candidate who carried Florida\u2019s 29 Electoral College votes \u2014 more than 10 percent of the total needed to win the White House \u2014 became president.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s string of Midwest victories in 2016 made Florida more of a symbolic prize for the president, who winters in Palm Beach and calls Florida his second home.\n\nTrump made Florida\u2019s 2018 midterm a referendum on his presidency by getting so aggressively involved in the races. Starting in 2017, he repeatedly urged Scott to challenge Nelson. Against the advice of his own political advisers, Trump endorsed DeSantis in the Republican primary for governor. He also rallied repeatedly in the state, twice in the closing seven days.\n\n\u201cVery clearly the president himself had a lot on the line and this election shows Florida is Trump Country,\u201d said Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser and Florida resident. \u201cThere\u2019s an absolute Trump majority in the state that can be mobilized.\u201d\n\nHeading into 2020, Stone said, the Democrats are faced with the realization that everything they\u2019ve tried against Trump has failed.\n\n\u201cTheir answer is to mobilize the same people they mobilized yesterday,\u201d Stone said. \u201cAnd they fell short.\u201d\n\nAshley Walker, who led the For Our Future coalition that turned out huge numbers of Democratic-leaning hard-to-reach voters for the midterm, said Tuesday was difficult but that Democrats need to remember they\u2019ve historically done better in presidential races.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve won two of the last three presidential races,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to predict what happens in 2020 on the day after the 2018 midterms.\u201d\n\nThe former chair of the Florida Democratic Party, Allison Tant, said she had a discussion with her husband about whether Florida should now be considered a Republican state. She said she\u2019s not ready to give up yet, but acknowledged she\u2019s still \u201cprocessing\u201d the grief of the election.\n\n\u201cWe had great candidates. Enthusiasm huge. Turn out huge. The other side as engaged and stoked by Trump. He got his base out for his candidates ... in red meat counties where he did rallies,\u201d she said via text message. \u201cDems don\u2019t understand the appeal. But we have to stop underestimating it.\u201d", "Jeffrey Yohai was mentioned several times at Paul Manafort\u2019s trial on tax and bank fraud charges in a Virginia federal court this summer | Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Ex-Manafort family member arrested in fraud case\n\nJeffrey Yohai, an ex-son-in-law of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, was arrested by federal authorities Wednesday on charges he carried out a series of financial scams after pleading guilty to real estate fraud in federal court in Los Angeles earlier this year.\n\nA criminal complaint secretly approved by a federal magistrate judge last month accuses Yohai of a veritable potpourri of fraudulent schemes totaling more than $21 million, including loan fraud, check kiting, cashing bad checks, forgery, selling fake tickets to the music festival Coachella and pawning $20,000 worth of stolen electric guitars and musical equipment.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nYohai, 36, was arrested on state charges related to some of the alleged frauds last month and taken into federal custody Wednesday, U.S. Attorney Nicola Hanna\u2019s office announced in a news release.\n\nYohai was married to Manafort\u2019s daughter Jessica in 2013. She filed for divorce in 2017.\n\nYohai was mentioned several times at Paul Manafort\u2019s trial on tax and bank fraud charges in a Virginia federal court this summer. Yohai wasn\u2019t charged in that case and was never called as a witness, but special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s prosecutors accused Manafort of providing fraudulent information in an effort to secure a loan from the Banc of California on properties in which he invested with Yohai.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Jurors split, 11 to 1, on the other charges, which were dismissed last month as part of a plea deal.\n\nThe new criminal complaint against Yohai makes clear that the investigation into the two men became significantly intertwined. Sherine Ebadi, the same California-based FBI agent who was a constant presence at Manafort\u2019s trial as the lead case agent, swore out the affidavit used to arrest Yohai this week.\n\nIn that affidavit, Ebadi also suggests Yohai tried to further his frauds by invoking his ties to the Manafort case and the broader Mueller probe.\n\nEbadi said that last month Yohai told men trying to sell a Los Angeles home that he\u2019d be traveling to Washington soon to aid Mueller\u2019s inquiry.\n\n\u201cDuring lunch, YOHAI told [the men] that he \u2018turned state's evidence\u2019 on his father-in-law, Paul Manafort,\u201d Edadi wrote. \u201cYOHAI made several statements\u2026that he had to go to \u2018D.C.\u2019 to meet with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office or \u2018downtown\u2019 to meet with \u2018the feds.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI know these statements to be false as I was the case agent for the Special Counsel's case against Manafort. The last time YOHAI met with me was in April 2018 and the topic of conversation was YOHAI, not Manafort,\u201d Ebadi added.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why Yohai\u2019s claims of involvement in the Mueller probe would make him a more attractive participant in a business deal.\n\nThe new complaint confirms reports in POLITICO and other news outlets in May that Yohai pleaded guilty earlier this year in a federal fraud case stemming from his earlier efforts to obtain financing for high-end properties in the Los Angeles area that he intended to \u201cflip\u201d and resell.\n\nEbadi says Yohai pleaded guilty to a single felony charge of bank wire fraud in federal court in Los Angeles in February. That hearing was held behind closed doors. The case remains under seal for reasons that have not been revealed.\n\nThe new complaint levels two additional felony charges at Yohai: wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He was formally advised of the new charges during an appearance in federal court Wednesday afternoon, but the charges are preliminary and will likely be replaced with a grand jury indictment soon.\n\nThe reports of Yohai\u2019s legal troubles and his felony plea earlier this year don\u2019t seem to have persuaded the rich and famous to steer clear of him.\n\nThe latest complaint says that, in August, Yohai brokered a deal for an NBA basketball player to rent a luxury L.A. home from physician Aaron Coppelson for two months for $160,000.\n\nThe player took up residence in the home, but the funds never arrived and Yohai offered a series of excuses for why.\n\nOne of the most colorful claims in the new charges is that Yohai tried to use a stash of marijuana to cover the debt he owed to Coppelson for that rental and others.\n\n\u201cYOHAI said he was getting Coppelson's money from a prominent marijuana grower who owed YOHAI $300,000,\u201d Ebadi wrote.\n\n\u201cWhen YOHAI arrived at Coppelson's house, he was driving a Porsche Panamera,\u201d she added. \u201cYOHAI said he did not have Coppelson's money, but he pulled out a large bag of marijuana from the trunk of the vehicle and offered it to Coppelson as collateral for the money owed.

Undeterred, he doubled down last year on his bet on Trump, becoming the only member of the state\u2019s congressional delegation to vote for the Republican tax overhaul that includes a cap on state-and-local income tax deductions.\n\nKim, 36, a former Obama administration official who worked as a civilian adviser on Iraq and worked in Afghanistan, ran a campaign focused on MacArthur's legislative record, while saying little about Trump on the campaign trail.\n\nMacArthur, who moved to the district to run for Congress after serving as mayor of Randolph in North Jersey, accused Kim \u2014 who grew up in the district but spent most of his adult life in Washington \u2014 of not really living there.\n\nMacArthur also went after Kim for allegedly embellishing his record, saying Kim held a more junior position as an adviser to General David Petraeus than he let on, and highlighting a Washington Post fact check that concluded Kim overstated the importance of an entry-level position he held in the George W.

The reasons Sanders gave for pulling Acosta\u2019s press pass were clearly fabricated.\n\nShe claimed in a statement that Acosta placed \u201chis hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern,\u201d which resulted in the decision to suspend Acosta\u2019s access to the White House until further notice. Video replays of the interaction showed that this was clearly not the case.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThe fact that CNN is proud of the way their employee behaved is not only disgusting, it is an example of their outrageous disregard for everyone, including young women, who work in this Administration,\u201d Sanders said in a statement to the White House press pool. \u201cAs a result of today\u2019s incident, the White House is suspending the hard pass of the reporter involved until further notice.\u201d\n\nLater in the evening, Sanders tweeted a video that included an NFL-instant-replay-like zoomed-in version of the incident, saying that the White House stood by its earlier decision. CNN personalities, including a network spokesperson, alleged that the video was doctored, with others pointing out that it appeared similar to a clip tweeted by an editor for the conspiracy site Infowars.\n\nAs president, Trump has launched an unprecedented war against journalists, frequently deriding \u201cthe fake news media\u201c and especially CNN. Acosta, who has gained notoriety for his sparring sessions with the president, has been perhaps his favorite target. The decision to pull his pass, however, marked a new escalation.\n\nMorning Media Your guide to the media circus \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nIn Wednesday\u2018s news conference earlier in the day, Trump grew increasingly irritated with Acosta\u2019s persistent questioning. At one point, the president called Acosta a \u201crude, terrible person\u201d who \u201cshouldn\u2019t be working for CNN.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, you should let me the run country, you should run CNN, and if you did it well, your ratings would be much better,\u201d Trump said.\n\nVideo from the event shows a press assistant then reaching to grab the microphone away from Acosta, who pulls back and continues trying to ask Trump a question about the Russia investigation. The president then walked away from his lectern while the woman grabbed the mic and gave it to another reporter.\n\nIt is clear from the video that Acosta did not make any inappropriate actions against the assistant.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday night, CNN said that it stood behind its reporter and that the move by the White House was an \u201cunprecedented decision and threat to our democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe White House announced tonight that it has revoked the press pass of CNN white house chief correspondent Jim Acosta, it was done in retaliation for his challenging questions at today\u2018s press conference,\u201d the network\u2019s statement reads. \u201cPress Secretary Sarah Sanders lied. She provided fraudulent accusations and cited an incident that never happened. This unprecedented decision is a threat to our democracy and the country deserves better. Jim Acosta has our full support.\u201d\n\nWhite House Correspondents\u2019 Association president Olivier Knox also issued a statement, saying that his group \u201cstrongly objects to the Trump Administration\u2018s decision to use US Secret Service security credentials as a tool to punish a reporter with whom it has a difficult relationship. Revoking access to the White House complex is a reaction out of line to the purported offense and is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nKnox added, \u201cWe urge the White House to immediately reverse this weak and misguided action.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, CNN had derailed its coverage of the midterm elections to hold panel discussions of the fireworks at Trump\u2019s news conference. But after the news that Acosta\u2019s hard pass had been revoked, the network stuck largely to its coverage of Trump\u2019s ouster of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Many have criticized media outlets for allowing Trump to play assignment editor for them, and in this case, at least, CNN seemed determined not to take his bait.\n\nOnly briefly at the end of Anderson Cooper\u2019s program on Wednesday night, Acosta appeared alongside the host to address the matter.\n\nThe CNN reporter said he tried to act professionally during the exchange with the president but that the decision to pull his press pass was about sending a message to his peers in the room.\n\n\u201cThis is a test for all of us,\u201d Acosta said. \u201cI do think they\u2019re trying to shut us down to some extent inside the White House press corps. And to some extent, I think they\u2019re trying to send a message to our colleagues.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, support rolled in for Acosta, even from those who have objected to his sometimes confrontational and attention-grabbing style of questioning.\n\n\u201cPlenty to criticize Acosta about, but he did not \u2018place his hands\u2019 on the intern,\" tweeted Chuck Ross, a reporter at The Daily Caller, a conservative site. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous for anyone to suggest he did. And after Trump joked about Gianforte bodyslamming Ben Jacobs the White House can\u2019t bust out the fainting couch now.\u201d\n\nAt a political rally last month, the president recalled the episode last year when Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.) assaulted a reporter from The Guardian, telling the crowd, \u201cAny guy who can do a body slam is my kind of guy.\u201d\n\nReuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason, himself a past president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, said he was next to Acosta during the entire news conference Wednesday and did not witness Acosta placing his hands on the intern, as Sanders claimed.\n\n\u201cI was seated next to \u2066@Acosta\u2069 at today\u2019s press conference and did not witness him \u2018placing his hands\u2019 on the young intern, as the White House alleges,\u201d Mason wrote on Twitter. \u201cHe held on to the microphone as she reached for it. The \u2066@Reuters\u2069 pictures below depict what happened accurately.\u201d\n\nResponding to the allegations on Twitter, Acosta called them a \u201clie\u201d and posted a video that he said was of a Secret Service officer asking him to hand over his pass and preventing him from entering the White House grounds for a live shot on Wednesday evening.\n\nPeter Baker, The New York Times\u2019 chief White House correspondent, said he had never seen anything like this happen in the more than two decades he\u2019s written about the West Wing.\n\n\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve never seen since I started covering the White House in 1996,\u201d Baker wrote on Twitter. \u201cOther presidents did not fear tough questioning.\u201d\n\nIt is relatively rare for former White House press secretaries to openly criticize the incumbent, but former spokesman Joe Lockhart, who worked in the Bill Clinton administration, tweeted: \u201cThe \u2018hard pass\u2019 that WH reporters are used as a security tool for the WH. Reporters who are vetted are allowed access that most reporters don\u2019t have. Those passes are not designed as a tool to pick the reporters you like or punish those you don\u2019t. This is an abuse of power.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, defended the decision. \u201cAs a former Press Secretary from a White House that operated very differently than the Trump White House, I am inclined to give reporters a lot of latitude,\u201d he wrote in an email to POLITICO. \u201cBut I cannot defend Jim Acosta\u2019s behavior. He doesn\u2019t just ask questions. He takes stands, which emphatically is not the job of a White House reporter.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has played with press access. In July, the White House barred CNN reporter Kaitlan Collins from covering an event after it took issue with questions she asked during an Oval Office photo op, but her credentials were not revoked. A so-called hard pass is the badge that allows regular White House reporters to swipe in and access the grounds.\n\nDuring his run for president, Trump\u2019s campaign also pulled several repoters\u2019 press badges, including some from The New York Times, The Washington Post, BuzzFeed and POLITICO. As a candidate, Trump promised not to bar reporters from the White House briefing room if he became president, saying at the time that \u201cit\u2019s a different thing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Acosta could gain access to the White House grounds on another basis since both daily and weekly media passes are available, but they have to be requested on a regular basis. The White House did not immediately reply to questions asking whether Acosta would be allowed in on these types of passes.\n\nChristopher Cadelago contributed to this report.", "Jeff Sessions, who spent two decades in the Senate, is practically a household name in Alabama. | Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images Elections Sessions might run for old Senate seat in Alabama\n\nFormer Attorney General Jeff Sessions is considering running for his old Alabama Senate seat in 2020, according to two people familiar with his thinking.\n\nSessions was fired as attorney general Wednesday, less than 24 hours after Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections.

He will remain the ringmaster of American politics until the day, presumably in January 2021 or 2025, when he waves and gets on Marine One for the last time.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHe made the midterms about him, because, really, what else would he make them about? Trump will never lose his interest in airtime, or the ratings. He boasted at a rally that, thanks to him, interest in the midterms was running higher than ever. And he was right.\n\nEven if Democrats had a larger victory, on the scale of the Republican sweep in 1994, it would be impossible to imagine Trump getting upstaged.\n\nAfter the so-called Republican Revolution, Newt Gingrich became a figure of fascination and stole the bully pulpit out from under President Bill Clinton. Gingrich soaked up every ounce of the attention and sought to govern the country from the House.

Bush\u2019s and Barack Obama\u2019s words for their own setbacks \u2014 it was a personal victory that had been blighted by some Republicans not sufficiently embracing him. He proceeded to mock by name fellow Republicans who had lost, in another presidential first.\n\nTrump has legitimate bragging rights: Losses in the House could have been worse, and the Republican showing in the Senate was strong. His political base is still there for him, and in many key statewide races, there for the candidate he endorsed and stumped for. His rallies are still a hot ticket three years after his initial rise. He now has a cadre of allies, like newly elected Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whom he basically created.\n\nAlienating traditional Republican voters in the suburbs, of course, comes with a real cost. For one thing, it hands Democrats a constituency spread throughout the country, as demonstrated by the GOP carnage in House races all over the place.\n\nBut, for Trump\u2019s purposes, the GOP\u2019s strength in Florida, Ohio and Iowa suggests that, all things being equal, key pieces of his 2016 electoral map are still ripe for the picking in 2020.\n\nLosing the House is a blow, not so much because it stalls Trump\u2019s congressional agenda (there wasn\u2019t going to be much of one), but because he now has an adversary with subpoena power.\n\nSo far, Nancy Pelosi has been restrained. She steered clear of flamboyant Resistance-like rhetoric and talk of impeachment.

The president has been discussing multiple Cabinet shakeup options with his advisers.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions may have been the first Trump Cabinet-level member purged in the wake of the midterm elections \u2014 but he is unlikely to be the last.\n\nSeveral Trump Cabinet officials and senior aides are on the ropes and could be pushed out by the end of the year in a dramatic shuffle that could reshape the character of his administration \u2014 but create new political headaches for the president.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThose officials include Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, whom Trump has said privately he wants to dismiss for her alleged weakness on border security. Trump has talked about replacing Nielsen with Kris Kobach, a right-wing immigration hawk who lost his bid for governor of Kansas governorship on Tuesday \u2014 though he has privately acknowledged Kobach would struggle to win Senate confirmation. Another name that\u2019s recently been discussed for the job: Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a longtime friend and ally of the president\u2019s.\n\nAlso newly vulnerable is Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, whose ethics have been the subject of an inspector general investigation. Trump acknowledged during a Wednesday post-election news conference, which he attempted to frame as a victory lap after his party lost control of the House of Representatives, that he is \u201clooking at\u201d the allegations against him. We\u2019ll probably have an idea about that in about a week\u201d he said. In the past, Trump has privately called Zinke, a former Navy SEAL who rode a horse named Tonto to his 2017 swearing-in ceremony, one of his favorite Cabinet members.\n\nIn weighing the fates of officials like Nielsen and Zinke, Trump will be torn between his desire to dump people he dislikes or considers unhelpful and the optics of mass firings and potentially ugly Senate confirmation fights, according to several White House aides and Trump allies.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of recruiting replacements. \u201cEverybody wants to work in this White House,\u201d Trump said at the news conference. \u201cThis is a hot White House.\u201d In fact, Trump has often struggled to find job candidates, a problem that could grow worse now that House Democrats will be subjecting Trump officials to vigorous investigations.\n\nThat tension animated internal White House debates about the departure of Sessions, who, after enduring months of presidential abuse, said in a letter to Trump that he was resigning at the president\u2019s \u201crequest.\u201d As late as Wednesday morning, Sessions was unaware of Trump\u2019s plans to replace him with his chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, who will serve as an \u201cacting\u201d attorney general who does not need Senate confirmation. The ability to avoid a potentially bloody Senate confirmation battle was a key factor in Whitaker\u2019s selection, White House aides said. Trump is considering naming a permanent replacement, such as Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, who has already been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nAnother vacancy already on Trump\u2019s plate: the post of Ambassador to the United Nations, which will be vacant after Nikki Haley leaves at the end of the year. The current front-runner, according to a senior administration official, is Heather Nauert, a former Fox News host turned State Department spokeswoman whom Trump last week called \u201cexcellent\u201d and said was \u201cunder serious consideration.\u201d\n\nBut Nauert\u2019s supporters and detractors alike have raised questions about her experience, and whether she could win confirmation even in a friendly GOP Senate. Nauert is also not national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s first choice for the job, but rose to front-runner status after Trump\u2019s first choice, former deputy national security adviser Dina Powell, took herself out of the running. Trump said last week that he would \u201cprobably make a decision\u201d on the post by the end of this week.\n\nAnother internal candidate for advancement is trade representative Robert Lighthizer, who, according to someone familiar with the discussions, is being floated as a potential replacement for Trump\u2019s 80-year-old Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross. Trump has called Ross \u201cpast his prime.\u201d\n\nTrump downplayed talk of a shakeup on Wednesday. \u201cA lot of administrations make changes after midterms,\u201d he Trump said. \u201cI will say that for the most part, I\u2019m very happy with this Cabinet.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest open questions involves the fate of Defense Secretary James Mattis, whom Trump recently described as \u201csort of a Democrat.\u201d Trump subsequently affirmed his support for the retired Marine Corps general, but not before throwing a cloud over his military chief that has Pentagon officials prepared for Mattis\u2019 departure.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has privately acknowledged the limits of his power to make changes. Much as he did with Sessions, Trump has long considered Nielsen disloyal \u2014 thanks in part to her service in the George W. Bush administration. Trump allies also view the two as a package deal, assuming that if White House chief of staff John Kelly is fired or quits Nielsen will follow suit. (A DHS spokesman told POLITICO that Nielsen is \"committed to implementing the President\u2019s security-focused agenda\" and \"will continue to do so.\u201d)\n\nBut Trump has told aides he knows Kobach would face an uphill confirmation battle, and that dismissing one of just three female members of his Cabinet would look bad in the wake of an election where Republicans struggled with female voters.\n\nThe gender factor is one reason he has expressed interest in Florida\u2019s Bondi, a longtime ally, and why he likes the idea of sending Nauert to the U.N.\n\nThen there is the perennial question of Kelly, about whom Trump has complained for months.\n\nBefore the midterms, administration officials said they expected Kelly to leave by the end of the year. At an election night watch party at the White House, where televisions showed four cable networks on a screen divided into quadrants, the chief of staff notably spent the evening across the room from his boss and had zero visible interaction with the president, the first lady, or members of the Trump family, according to someone in the room. But his long chilly relationship with the president hasn\u2019t changed recently, said a former official \u2014 noting that Kelly could leave tomorrow or in 12 months, as has been the case almost since he started the job.\n\nAsked on Wednesday about Kelly\u2019s future, Trump was decidedly noncommittal.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard about John Kelly,\u201d Trump said at the news conference. \u201cPeople leave.\u201d", "Washington offices of major corporations now are grappling with how to work a Democratic House full of newly elected members. | Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images Lobbying House Democrats\u2019 win fuels K Street hiring 'Who knows House leadership?' a top Democratic lobbyist said firms are asking now.

The law and lobbying firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck over the summer hired Nadeam Elshami, a former chief of staff to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who\u2019s poised to return to the speakership if she can survive a potential rebellion among her members.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a former chief of staff to Mitch McConnell and a former chief of staff to Nancy Pelosi,\u201d said Marc Lampkin, a Republican and the managing partner of Brownstein Hyatt\u2019s Washington office.\n\nOthers waited until after the election to see which way the winds blew, meaning the scramble to snap up Democratic Hill staffers and others with policy expertise is far from over, said Ivan Adler, a headhunter who specializes in the lobbying business.\n\n\u201cEither you have enough Democrats or don\u2019t, and if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re playing catch-up,\u201d Adler said.\n\nCompanies and trade groups don\u2019t necessarily have lobbyists on staff who reflect the diversity of the new House majority, either.\n\nDemocrats added several members of color to their caucus last night, including Colin Allred, who ousted Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas); Lauren Underwood, who defeated Rep. Randy Hultgren (R-Ill.); and Antonio Delgado, who beat Rep. John Faso (R-N.Y.). Many incoming House committee chairmen are expected to be members of the Congressional Black Caucus or the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and the first Muslim and Native American women were elected to Congress.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how prepared firms are for that,\u201d said Marcus Mason, a lobbyist at the Madison Group who\u2019s on the board of the Congressional Black Caucus Political Action Committee.\n\nDemocrats also elected nearly two dozen new members who pledged to reject corporate PAC money, according to End Citizens United PAC, which supported such candidates, quintupling the number of House Democrats who\u2019ve made such promises. It\u2019s not clear how receptive these members will be to overtures from lobbyists.\n\nBut Jeff Forbes, a Democratic lobbyist and co-founder of the firm Forbes Tate, said he expected members who are more business friendly to play an important role in the caucus.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be a number of voices of reason who don\u2019t just hate corporations,\u201d Forbes said.\n\nRegardless, corporations had braced for the possibility that Democrats could retake the House and use the majority to launch investigations that might ensnare them, with the pharmaceutical, banking, tech and energy industries viewed as possible targets.\n\nThe anticipation was widespread enough that Washington lawyers who specialize in helping companies navigate such investigations started preparing months ago for a boom in business. The Republican lobbyist Bruce Mehlman sent a memo to clients last month speculating that Democrats might investigate issues such as chief executive pay, corporate boardroom diversity, health care costs and net neutrality if they won back the chamber.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a pharmaceutical company, you\u2019re pretty concerned,\u201d said Scott Eckart, a lobbyist at the Democratic firm Emergent Strategies, noting that many Democratic candidates ran ads highlighting the high cost of prescription drugs during the campaign.\n\nBut some Democratic lobbyists said they were skeptical the party would train its focus on corporate America, saying the House is more likely to look into President Donald Trump\u2019s conduct in office \u2014 including his firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI think the whole investigations thing is overplayed by the press,\u201d said Steve Elmendorf, a top Democratic lobbyist.\n\nThe exceptions, he said, are companies that sought favors from the Trump administration in its first two years \u2014 proof of which could be discovered in Democrats\u2019 investigations of the administration.\n\n\u201cAnybody who had any contact with this administration should be worried about what that contact was,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump threatened Wednesday to refuse to work with Democrats if they do investigate his administration, raising the potential for gridlock \u2014 typically a bad omen for the lobbying industry, which thrives on action \u2014 until at least 2020.\n\nAnd even if House Democrats and Senate Republicans do work together, it was unclear after the president and Pelosi held separate news conferences on their policy agendas what legislation could pass a divided Congress.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure\u2019s the only word that they both said that anybody believes is in the realm of the possible,\u201d said John Murray, a former Republican congressional aide who\u2019s now a lobbyist at Monument Policy Group.\n\nBut speculation in the early months of Trump\u2019s presidency that he might collaborate with Democrats on an infrastructure bill never came to fruition, and it\u2019s unclear whether the odds will be any better this time around.\n\nDavid French, the top lobbyist for the National Retail Federation, which saw its lobbying outlays soar during the first year of the administration, said the trade group\u2019s expectations for the next two years are more modest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re realistic that not a lot of big things are going to happen,\u201d French said.\n\n", "One donor for Amy McGrath\u2019s unsuccessful long-shot Congressional campaign said she had no regrets about sending a series of donations to the Kentucky Democrat. | Bryan Woolston/AP Photo Elections 'I don\u2019t regret a thing': Democrats aim to keep small-donor boom going in 2020 Small donors bet big on some losing candidates in the midterms, but several said they knew they were taking a risk with their money and stood by their decisions.\n\nJudy Stanfield had never donated money to a political candidate until she saw a two-minute ad about Kentucky Democrat Amy McGrath\u2019s successful struggle to become a fighter pilot.\n\nInspired, Stanfield, who is 70 and lives in Ponte Vedra, Florida, gave $2,000 in installments to the congressional candidate over the course of the campaign season using the online platform ActBlue, making her part of the throng of people who helped McGrath\u2019s long-shot campaign far outstrip her Republican opponent\u2019s fundraising, $7.8 million to $4.8 million.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI\u2019d kick in again and again,\u201d Stanfield said the day after McGrath lost her bid for Congress. \u201cI was really hoping she\u2019d make it.\u201d\n\nA surge in Democratic fundraising across the board \u2014 in no small part thanks to small-dollar donors like Stanfield \u2014 helped candidates from Kentucky to California to Texas mount competitive bids for Congress and win control of the House on Tuesday.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

But it also is taking the decision on how to allocate campaign dollars away from Washington committees and super PACs and placing it in the hands of donors who, this cycle, helped boost some campaigns to victory but also bet goliath-sized sums on losing candidates like McGrath, who lost to GOP Rep. Andy Barr, Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.\n\nStill, small-dollar donors reached by POLITICO on Wednesday showed no sign of regret, and Democratic fundraisers are betting they can keep them giving into 2020, when they\u2019ll have congressional and presidential races to support. And Republicans are increasingly discussing how to counter ActBlue, which accounted for approximately $1.6 billion of the $2.5 billion that Democrats spent during this election cycle.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Stanfield said when asked whether she would donate to another political candidate.\n\nThen, after hesitating, she added: \u201cIf somebody else comes along that has a really strong, positive message and has a chance to win, I would probably do it again.\u201d\n\nBoth Democratic congressional campaigns and presidential contenders will waste no time in trying to recapture the party\u2019s \u201cgreen wave,\u201d as it was dubbed by GOP operatives. In recent years, raising money online has become a bedrock of political campaigns, and 2020 presidential contenders have already started communicating digitally \u2014 most often, using email lists to raise money for other candidates \u2014 as a warm-up for campaigns to come. Digital outreach has already helped President Donald Trump bank more than $100 million for his reelection campaign, far more than any other sitting president at this point in an election cycle.\n\nMoney did not always translate to victory Tuesday. Some Democrats \u2014 such as O\u2019Rourke\u2019s $70 million Texas Senate campaign \u2014 came close in what initially appeared to be near-impossible races. Other well-funded Senate Democrats found the money wasn\u2019t enough to tip the scales. Sen. Claire McCaskill raised more than $35 million in her quest to win reelection in Missouri, but GOP opponent Josh Hawley defeated her, despite raising only $10 million.\n\nBut Democratic fundraisers said they did not believe small donors would be turned off by those disappointments, and they said anyone seeking the party\u2019s nomination for president in 2020 is likely to try to leverage the same grassroots energy.\n\n\u201cThis is a kind of fundraising we have never seen on the left at this scale. It changes who can be a viable candidate, and it brings people into the process,\u201d said Erin Hill, executive director of ActBlue. \u201cSmall-dollar donors are going to have a huge impact on Democrats in 2019 in the primary.\u201d\n\nAnd in conversations with POLITICO on Wednesday, several donors to long-shot Democratic hopefuls said they were aware they had taken risks with their money \u2014 and stood by their decisions.\n\n\u201cI am not one bit sorry. I wish I could have given more. I don\u2019t regret a thing,\u201d said Patricia Emerson, a therapist based in Palmdale, Calif., who donated at least $1,068 to O\u2019Rourke \u2014 some of it in chunks as small as $5 at a time \u2014 as well as other Democratic candidates, according to campaign disclosures.\n\n\u201cIf he did it again, I\u2019d do it again,\u201d Emerson added.\n\nExperts attribute ActBlue\u2019s ease of use and browsability to the surge of money from all over the country that flowed into Democratic candidates\u2019 campaign coffers \u2014 and some Republicans feel there\u2019s an urgent need for a competitor on their side of the political spectrum.\n\n\u201cActBlue has done a remarkable job in terms of being a central clearinghouse for House and Senate Democratic candidates, and the GOP has no equivalent entity,\u201d said veteran GOP campaign finance lawyer Michael Toner. \u201cThis has become an existential crisis for the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nThough digital fundraising emerged at the forefront of House and Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign strategies in 2018, big-dollar donors on both the left and the right continued to bankroll huge swaths of election spending. Billionaires Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, both of whom are thought to be considering presidential bids in 2020, each spent upwards of $100 million on efforts to sway the midterm elections.\n\nBut the boom in small-dollar giving in the 2018 election cycle undeniably helped Democrats \u2014 who in past years have often struggled to keep up with Republicans\u2019 cash drives \u2014 outpace their GOP counterparts. Democrats are estimated to have spent $2.5 billion in the midterms, compared to Republicans\u2019 $2.2 billion, according to estimates compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThat was especially true on the Senate side: Democratic candidates for the upper chamber brought in 27 percent of their total fundraising from small contributions this cycle, compared to 13 percent for Republicans. House candidates raised 16 percent of their funds from small contributions, compared to 8 percent for Republicans.\n\nArmin Wulf, a retiree living in Berkeley, Calif., said he\u2019d sworn off donating to political campaigns after Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 \u2014 until he saw O\u2019Rourke\u2019s viral defense of former NFL player Colin Kaepernick and read up on the El Paso congressman\u2019s Senate campaign. He gave O\u2019Rourke at least $625 in small increments via ActBlue, federal campaign disclosures show.\n\nWulf said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d donate to O\u2019Rourke again if the politician sought another office, and he said he is considering what he\u2019ll do when it comes to donating to other Democrats.\n\n\u201cIt would have been a wonderful event if he had made it, but of course it\u2019s Texas,\u201d Wulf said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s totally OK \u2014 it was a tight race.\u201d\n\n", "Kris Kobach, who lost his bid for Kansas governor Tuesday, could end up winning the AG sweepstakes. | Orlin Wagner/AP Photo Legal Here are the possible replacements for Jeff Sessions\n\nPresident Donald Trump Donald Trump requested Attorney Jeff Sessions\u2019 resignation Wednesday, tapping the former Alabama senator\u2019s chief of staff Matthew Whitaker to succeed him in an acting capacity.\n\nTrump said he will nominate a permanent replacement \u201cat a later date.\u201d It\u2019s unclear who the president will tap to lead the Justice Department on a permanent basis, but here are potential candidates who have been floated over the past few weeks:\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMatthew Whitaker\n\nWhitaker \u201cwill serve our Country well\u201d as acting Attorney General, Trump announced.

Bradbury has defended his role helping write the memos, which provided legal justification for harsh interrogation techniques.\n\nJohn Sullivan\n\nSullivan was easily confirmed 94-6 in May 2017 as deputy secretary of state.

Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, signaled plans to investigate Attorney General Jeff Sessions' removal. | Alex Brandon/AP Photo Congress Sessions firing rattles newly divided Congress\n\nJeff Sessions\u2019 ouster on Wednesday is already stoking a political firestorm on Capitol Hill, as Democrats warn that Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation could be in jeopardy while GOP senators prepare for the suddenly easier task of confirming a replacement.\n\nSessions\u2019 departure was hardly surprising for senators who have anticipated for months that President Donald Trump would force him from the Department of Justice helm following Tuesday\u2019s midterms. But the ascension of new acting attorney general Matt Whitaker could rejigger the politics of two long-stalled legislative efforts: a criminal justice bill that counts bipartisan support in the Senate but that Sessions resisted, and a bipartisan plan to shield Mueller from firing that Democrats have long pushed to pass.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHouse Democrats won\u2019t take power until January, giving them little recourse to respond to Sessions\u2019 ouster. But both Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Elijah Cummings, who\u2019s expected to chair the House Oversight Committee next year, signaled plans to investigate Sessions' removal.\n\nIn the Senate, the GOP\u2019s strong showing in the midterms means Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will have an easier time confirming Sessions\u2019 replacement. That process is likely to happen early next year, given Trump\u2019s announcement that he has yet to decide on a permanent leader for DOJ.\n\nMcConnell told reporters Wednesday, before Sessions\u2019 firing became public, that he was preparing for Trump to make high-level changes after the midterms, \u201cand we\u2019ll process them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not up to me who they put in the Cabinet. They serve at his pleasure,\u201d McConnell said of Trump. \u201cAnd if he makes changes, we\u2019ll be dealing with whoever he sends up.\u201d\n\nWhitaker is poised to take over supervision of the Mueller probe following Sessions\u2019 ouster because the former Alabama GOP senator had recused himself from the Russia investigation in early 2017, before Mueller\u2019s appointment. Democrats are hopeful that the new acting attorney general\u2019s elevation doesn't prematurely doom the special counsel\u2019s work.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 stronger hold on the Senate next year gives Democrats fewer tools to halt the confirmation of a new attorney general. But they still pushed on Wednesday for Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller probe, citing Whitaker\u2019s public criticism of the special counsel\u2019s investigation and suggestion that Mueller\u2019s budget could get chopped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say this: protecting Mueller and his investigation is paramount,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cIt would create a constitutional crisis if this were a prelude to ending or greatly limiting the Mueller investigation.\u201d\n\nIncoming Republican Utah Senator Mitt Romney also raised concern over Mueller\u2019s probe, tweeting that it\u2019s vital that the investigation \u201cproceeds to its conclusion unimpeded\u201d under Whitaker.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s two top Democratic backers of bipartisan legislation crafted to shield Mueller\u2019s job, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Chris Coons of Delaware, also made a public push for Congress to pass their legislation. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who joined Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) to steer that legislation through the Judiciary Committee, was silent on the future of the Mueller protection bill in his own statement on Sessions\u2019 departure.\n\nA Democratic House is likely to act favorably on legislation that would protect Mueller's investigation. But it\u2019s unclear whether McConnell would allow the bill to advance given his previous skepticism of its necessity. If Whitaker acts on previous suggestions to starve Mueller's probe of resources or to sharply limit his scope, the matter could come to a head sooner.\n\nAnd if Democrats wanted to force the issue of formal protection for Mueller, they're about to get a vehicle to do so: the must-pass year-end spending bill that lawmakers will have to take up before current government funding expires on Dec. 7.\n\nMcConnell has, however, agreed to conduct a whip count of where his conference stands on a bipartisan criminal justice measure for which Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has spent years amassing bipartisan support. Sessions, known for his hawkish stance on criminal justice issues, tangled with Grassley on the issue earlier this year and has opposed even a smaller-scale House-passed bill that addresses only federal prisons, not sentencing.\n\nWith Whitaker, criminal justice reform backers have a potentially far more amenable partner in their efforts, which are backed by the influential Koch network on the right as well as some progressive advocacy groups. It\u2019s not clear whether McConnell will tee up a vote on the criminal justice measure if it fares well in this month\u2019s whip count. But at least one GOP senator portrayed Sessions\u2019 departure as a possible sea change.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that President Trump will take this opportunity to nominate a replacement that is invested in criminal justice reform,\u201d Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said after thanking Sessions in a tweet. \u201cThe AG is uniquely placed to lead our nation forward on this important issue.\u201d\n\nHolly Harris, a veteran Kentucky GOP strategist who\u2019s working to pass a criminal justice deal at the nonprofit Justice Action Network, sounded a positive note about the arrival of a new acting attorney general.\n\n\u201cWe have an incredible opportunity here to chart a completely different course for our country\u2019s justice system,\u201d Harris said in an interview. \"I\u2019m very hopeful that new leadership at the Department of Justice will work with us to do that.\u201d\n\nKyle Cheney and Burgess Everett contributed to this report.", "\"Beto has captured the imagination of Democrats in Iowa just as he has around the country,\u201d said Jeff Link, an Iowa Democratic strategist. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Elections Beto\u2019s consolation prize: Running for president Democratic activists in Iowa and New Hampshire welcome the vanquished Texas candidate with open arms.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke dodged a bullet.

I pray for the soul of anyone who has to run against him in Iowa in 453 days.\"\n\nAs it happens, O\u2019Rourke's barnstorming campaign style, which took him to every county in Texas, is the same retail-intensive approach that has traditionally worked in the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucuses. Rick Santorum famously won the 2012 Republican caucuses after visiting all 99 of Iowa\u2019s counties in a pickup truck, a feat O\u2019Rourke matched this year in Texas\u2019 254 counties with the aid of rented minivans.\n\n\"He's been running the kind of campaign in Texas which is exactly what causes one to be successful in Iowa, which is going around to all of Iowa and sitting down and talking to folks,\" said Bonnie Campbell, a former Iowa attorney general who remains active in the state\u2019s Democratic politics.\n\n\"Beto has captured the imagination of Democrats in Iowa just as he has around the country,\u201d said Jeff Link, a Democratic strategist in the state. \"The fact that he has spent so much time in rural Texas would bode well for him coming up here.\"\n\nO\u2019Rourke ultimately performed poorly in rural Texas, a shortcoming that sealed his 2\u00bd point defeat. But his loss came with enough silver linings for the state\u2019s Democrats that pivoting from defeat to the national stage is unlikely to breed the sort of resentment among party members back home that can be a drag on a presidential candidacy. The voters O\u2019Rourke drove to the polls helped Texas Democrats flip two House seats and make gains in the state Legislature.\n\nTexas Democrats can keep going back to the new voters identified and mobilized by O\u2019Rourke as they continue their efforts to turn the state purple, said Wendy Davis, a former Democratic state senator who ran for governor in 2014. \"He's now built upon an infrastructure that I've built, and he\u2019s built on it dramatically,\" she said.\n\nAnother tall and lanky politician, Abraham Lincoln, ran for president and won after losing two campaigns for Senate. More recently, Missouri Democrat Jason Kander pivoted from a 2016 Senate loss to the national stage, setting himself up as a leader on voting rights and laying the groundwork for a possible 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nBefore Kander, a former Army intelligence officer, announced last month he was taking a hiatus from politics to deal with PTSD, he had been generating enthusiasm in New Hampshire, the second state on the presidential nominating calendar, according to Jay Surdukowski, a Concord-based attorney and Democratic activist.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, whose term in the House expires at the end of the year, would also find a warm welcome in New Hampshire, Surdukowski said. \"Beto is Jason Kander times a hundred in terms of his appeal and potential connection to New Hampshire voters,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, without having visited, O\u2019Rourke has already captivated the state\u2019s Democrats.

And that will take all of the political skills Pelosi has mastered during her 31 years in Congress.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Her track record makes clear that it\u2019s a bad idea to bet against her. During a news conference Wednesday, she bristled at questions over whether she had the needed votes to reclaim the gavel.\n\n\"I think I am the best person to go forward to unify and negotiate,\" Pelosi said. \"I am a good negotiator, as anyone can see in terms of how we have won every negotiation so far.\"\n\nPelosi added: \"I am not going to answer any more questions on that subject.\"\n\nPelosi's bid for the speakership comes as her fellow septuagenarians declared their own bids to reclaim years-old positions in the majority. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) announced that he would seek the majority leader position around the same time Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) declared he's running for whip.\n\nClyburn, however, faces a challenger this year: Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado also has declared for the position. Contenders for other lower-level spots in leadership also began making calls. The race for caucus chair between California Democrats Rep. Barbara Lee and Linda S\u00e1nchez is heating up.\n\nMost eyes, however, are focused on Pelosi.\n\nSo far, no Democrat is challenging her, though those who want to drive her from Washington are organizing to try to block her ascent. And yet, many of these critics appear to be waiting to hear from the incoming freshman class, hopeful that the new candidates will take the lead.\n\nWith some Election Day votes still being counted, it\u2019s also unclear how large the Democratic majority will be and what kind of cushion Pelosi will have.\n\nPelosi opponents are ready to shepherd the political newcomers and plan to reach out to Tuesday\u2019s Democratic winners who have publicly expressed opposition \u2014 either directly or indirectly \u2014 to voting for Pelosi as party leader, according to some sources.\n\nThey\u2019ll frame their pitch as a bid to save the House in 2020, arguing that forcing some of these Democrats from red districts to vote for Pelosi will make them vulnerable next election.\n\nRep. Tim Ryan said as much Tuesday night in a brief interview. The Ohio Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Pelosi two years ago said Democrats have a responsibility to protect the \"majority makers\" from GOP attack ads that will highlight their votes for Pelosi.\n\nRyan said he wasn't currently looking at challenging Pelosi again, though he did not rule it out. \u201cAt the end of the day it\u2019s got to be about these new candidates,\" Ryan said. \"They need to advise us as to what direction they want to go in. \u2026 they won in red districts.\u201d\n\nRyan added: \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we listen to them for the next few days as to what the leadership needs to look like for them\u2026 they should have a big say in this.\u201d\n\nWhile a number of House races had yet to be called Wednesday morning, about a dozen candidates who have demanded \u201cnew leadership\u201d or said they won\u2019t vote for Pelosi, won. It is unclear, however, how many are willing to actually vote against her on the floor.\n\nPelosi allies have suggested some of these new members could simply vote against her in the private caucus meeting in late November, when Pelosi only needs a majority, and then back her on the floor on Jan. 3, the first day of the new Congress. Other possibilities being discussed include asking opponents to vote \"present\" or skip the vote entirely, which would allow Pelosi to take the gavel without their help.\n\nBut some candidates have confirmed they won\u2019t go for that, including Conor Lamb, Abigail Spanberger and Jason Crow.\n\nYet for all the complaints from her Democratic critics, Pelosi has enormous advantages heading into this fight:\n\n\u00b7 Pelosi has been the only party leader for a generation of Democrats. She\u2019s led them in the majority, in the minority, and now in the majority again. They know her and they are used to her.\n\n\u00b7 Pelosi is a fundraising juggernaut who raised tens of millions of dollars for Democratic challengers and incumbents this cycle. That buys a lot of goodwill.\n\n\u00b7 A historic number of women candidates won election, which Pelosi will use to her advantage. Her allies wonder how these women could actually vote against the first female speaker.\n\n\u00b7 Pelosi will have committee assignments, commission posts, and other perks to divvy out in return for support.\n\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Ben Ray Lujan downplayed suggestions that swing-district victors would be attacked in the future by Republicans if they backed Pelosi after suggesting they would not. Those who called for \u201cnew leadership,\u201d he argued, already having delivered by becoming leaders in their own right and coming to Washington.\n\nThe New Mexico Democrat, who is running to be assistant democratic leader, also argued that constituents don\u2019t care about the Pelosi question as much as policy issues that impact them.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most important is that we work to deliver on commitments made to the American people\u2026 an infrastructure package, cleaning up Washington D.C. and helping lower the costs of prescription drug prices across America,\u201d he said. \u201cI really believe that if we delivered on those commitments, that that\u2019s how our colleagues will be measures.\u201d\n\nFor their part, President Donald Trump and GOP congressional leaders are already acting as if Pelosi will be speaker next year.\n\nTrump has said he wants to work with Pelosi on boosting infrastructure spending and lowering prescription drug prices, two rare policy stances of agreement.\n\n\"I think she's a very smart woman. She has done a very good job,\u201d Trump said at a press conference Wednesday, adding that the two didn\u2019t discuss the prospect of impeachment in a phone call.\n\n\u201cA lot of people thought I was beings sarcastic or joking, I wasn\u2019t,\u201d Trump added, in reference to a tweet saying Pelosi deserved to be speaker. \u201cThere was nothing sarcastic about it, it was really meant with good intentions.\u201d", "Because of previous remarks criticizing the special counsel's Russia probe, some Democrats have begun calling on acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to recuse himself from the investigation. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Legal New acting A.G. criticized Mueller probe several times\n\nMatthew Whitaker, whom President Donald Trump named as acting attorney general on Wednesday, has previously been outspoken about special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, going so far as to imply that the investigation could be turning into a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nTrump asked Attorney General Sessions to resign on Wednesday, a day after the midterm elections. Whitaker is serving in his place until Trump announces a permanent replacement.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhitaker previously served as a legal commentator on CNN, where he was at times critical of the Mueller inquiry. His critiques slowed down after he became Sessions\u2018 chief of staff on Sept. 22, 2017.\n\nBecause of those previous remarks, some Democrats have begun calling on Whitaker to recuse himself from the investigation.\n\n\u201cGiven his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Mark Warner (D-Va.), vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, posted on Twitter: \u201cGiven Mr. Whitaker\u2019s public comments on the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation and the President\u2019s obvious self-interest in appointing him to the Acting AG role, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself.\u201d\n\nHere are times Whitaker referred to the Mueller investigation:\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\nWhitaker declared that Russia did not collude with Trump\u2018s 2016 campaign, although Mueller has yet to release a report on the findings of the investigation.\n\n\u201cThe truth is there was no collusion with the Russians and the Trump campaign,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cThere was interference by the Russians into the election, but that was not collusion with the campaign. That\u2019s where the left seems to be combining those two issues.\"\n\n\u201cThe last thing they want right now is the truth to come out,\u201c he continued, \u201cand the fact that there\u2019s not a single piece of evidence that demonstrates that the Trump campaign had any illegal or even improper relationships with the Russians. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nAlthough he said he thought Mueller was \u201ca well-respected lawyer,\u201d Whitaker at the time said that he didn\u2019t believe there was enough evidence to conduct an investigation.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m a former prosecutor, I know how investigations go, and I know that what we know publicly, there\u2019s not enough for a case, but certainly Bob Mueller has all the power of the federal government now to conduct an investigation and he may turn over things that we just haven\u2019t heard about yet,\u201d he said .\n\nJuly 10, 2017\n\nWhitaker even took to defending Donald Trump Jr. for a meeting the president\u2018s eldest son had with a Russian official, ostensibly to discuss Hillary Clinton, saying that any politician would agree to such a meeting.\n\n\u201cIf you have somebody that you trust that is saying you need to meet with this individual because they have information about your opponent, you would take that meeting,\u201c he said.\n\nHe added that Trump Jr. probably didn\u2019t know what he was getting into when he agreed to the meeting.\n\n\u201cNow, obviously, as it evolves, it becomes a little concerning, but I don\u2018t think when they went into that meeting at the time that they knew that it was a lawyer from Russia that had an issue regarding foreign adoptions,\u201c Whitaker said.\n\nJuly 26, 2017\n\nWhitaker, while speaking about whether Trump was trying to oust Sessions at the time, said during an interview that he believed that what Trump was \u201cgoing to start doing is putting pressure on [Deputy Attorney General] Rod Rosenstein, who is in charge of this investigation, is acting attorney general, and really try to get Rod to maybe even cut the budget of Bob Mueller and do something a little more stage-crafty than the blunt instrument of firing the attorney general and trying to replace him.\u201d\n\nHe later added: \u201cI could see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced, it would recess appointment and that attorney general doesn\u2019t fire Bob Mueller but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigations grinds to almost a halt.\u201d\n\nAug. 3, 2017\n\nDuring an interview on CNN, Whitaker called on Rosenstein to intervene in Mueller\u2019s investigation into Trump Organization finances, adding that he thought Mueller would be \u201ccrossing a red line.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Bob Mueller, and his small U.S. Attorney\u2019s office, as I\u2019ve heard it described today, does go beyond the 2016 election,\u201d he said , \u201cand get into Trump Organization finances, unrelated to the 2016 election and really unrelated to Russia coordination, if it even exists, I think that would be crossing a red line and I think that\u2019s when the deputy attorney general, who is the acting attorney general for the purpose for this investigation, Rod Rosenstein, who I served with in the Bush administration, he needs to step in and pull the reins back on Bob Mueller if he starts to go outside the bounds of his delegation of authority.\u201d\n\nAug. 4, 2017\n\nWhitaker tweeted out an opinion article questioning whether Trump could fire Mueller, adding that it\u2019s \u201cworth a read.\u201d\n\nThe article, published by POLITICO Magazine, notes that if \u201cSessions is replaced as attorney general, then his successor would not be recused, and could either gin up good cause to fire Mueller or (more likely) rescind the good-cause requirement and then terminate him.\u201d\n\nAug. 6, 2017\n\nWhitaker three days later doubled down on his previous statement that Mueller was \u201cdangerously close\u201d to crossing a red line if the special counsel began investigating Trump\u2019s finances.\n\n\u201cIf he were to continue to investigate the financial relationships without a broadened scope in his appointment, then this would raise serious concerns that the special counsel\u2019s investigation was a mere witch hunt,\u201d Whitaker wrote . \u201cIf Mueller is indeed going down this path, Rosenstein should act to ensure the investigation is within its jurisdiction and within the authority of the original directive.\u201d\n\nThe same day, Whitaker tweeted an article he deemed \u201cworth a read.\u201c It was titled \u201cNote to Trump's lawyer: Do not cooperate with Mueller lynch mob\u201c and was written by George Parry, a former state and federal prosecutor.\n\nThe opinion piece went on to criticize Ty Cobb, who at the time was on the president\u2019s legal team, for saying that the the White House would fully cooperate with Mueller, saying that doing so would be \"a trap, plain and simple.\"\n\n\u201cThe absolute last thing someone in your client\u2018s position should do is cooperate with Mueller,\u201c the Parry article continued. \u201cFor the target of a grand jury investigation, cooperation is a sucker play guaranteed to result in disaster.\u201c\n\nAug. 7, 2017\n\nWhitaker criticized the length of Mueller\u2018s investigation during an interview, and later went on to say that he hoped his CNN op-ed published the day before would go on to create a discussion to pressure Rosenstein to add more limits on the special counsel.\n\n\u201cIt could hamper the president for some time to come, which is disappointing because I just don\u2018t think the scope and what it\u2018s supposed to be, which is Russian coordination with the Trump campaign in the 2016 election,\u201c he said. \u201cThat is not an enormous amount of information a seasoned prosecutor like Bob Mueller and 16 assistants, I think is the count now, could easily distill that in months not years.\u201c\n\n\u201cIt needs to have Rod Rosenstein do more than what he did yesterday, which is to make sure that he is managing Bob Mueller's investigation and the responsibility that he has as the acting attorney general and to give the American people a little more comfort that it's not going to turn into a fishing expedition like these special counsel and independent counsels have in our past,\u201c he continued.\n\nAug. 9, 2017\n\nDuring an interview with Sean Hannity, Whitaker continued to maintain that he believed Mueller\u2018s investigation should be limited.\n\n\u201cI think fundamentally this investigation by Bob Mueller needs to be limited, it has to be limited and anybody who is saying that Bob Mueller looking into unrelated financial transactions of the president, his family or his associates before he seeks to get an extension of his authority is really trying to shred the 4th Amendment,\u201c he said.\n\nAug. 17, 2017\n\nWhile retweeting an article, Whitaker doubted the release of evidence from Mueller\u2019s inquiry.\n\n\u201cArticle is correct, it will be very difficult to ever see evidence discovered by #Mueller grand jury investigation,\u201d he said in a tweet , including a retweet from NPR that said: \u201cThose fervently depending on Robert Mueller to shake up the Trump presidency may be in for some disappointment.\u201d\n\nAug. 25, 2017\n\nIn a tweet, he criticized the FBI\u2019s raid of the home of Paul Manafort, who served as Trump\u2019s campaign manager. Manafort was indicted for obstruction of justice and witness tampering in June, and was later convicted of bank and tax fraud charges.\n\n\u201cDo we want our Gov\u2019t to \u2018intimidate\u2019 us? Hmm \u2014 FBI\u2019s Manafort raid incl. a dozen agents, \u2018designed to intimidate,\u2019\u201d Whitaker tweeted .", "A White House aide tries to take away a microphone from CNN journalist Jim Acosta during a news conference on Wednesday, Nov. 7. | AP Photo/Evan Vucci Fourth Estate Trump Can\u2019t Fire CNN Jeff Sessions is gone, but Jim Acosta isn\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nSpeaking at times in a gangster\u2019s vengeful whisper, a visibly whipped yet red-hot President Donald Trump met the press for almost 90 minutes Wednesday to proclaim victory in the midterm elections in which Republicans lost the House but increased their hold on the Senate. Why was Trump so agitated? The loss was expected, as was the victory.\n\nWhat the press and viewers didn\u2019t know was that Trump\u2014despite doing it weekly on The Apprentice\u2014had just done something he hates to do: He had fired\u2014or set into motion the firing of\u2014Attorney General Jeff Sessions, information that wouldn\u2019t be made public for about an hour after the presser\u2019s klieg lights cooled. Like the gambler coming home after losing his shirt at the racetrack, Trump was hungry to spend his fury on someone or something. Knowing how much better he would feel after shouting \u201cExcuse me! Excuse me!\u201d at chattering reporters and ordering them to sit down, he made certain to call on his nemesis Jim Acosta from CNN in the early going.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAcosta loves taking the role of the pest whenever called on to play a live scene with the president. Usually, the president is happy to oblige him and Wednesday was no exception. Trump interrupted Acosta\u2019s opening question (a technique he uses to destabilize his questioners)\u2014\u201cHere we go,\u201d said a pleasingly peeved Trump. Quickly the two were verbally wrapped around one another like mating snakes, correcting and disputing each other\u2019s statement about the migrant caravan. \u201cThe caravan is an invasion,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt is not an invasion,\u201d countered Acosta. \u201cThank you for that information,\u201d Trump sarcastically interrupted after Acosta defined the caravan as a \u201cgroup of migrants moving up from Central America to the U.S.\u201d\n\nDespite decades of wrestling with the media, Trump continues to treat them as if they were his employees. It would not be out of character for Trump to pause during a news conference to ask Jonathan Karl of ABC or Josh Dawsey of the Washington Post to run over to the briefing room\u2019s vending machine and get him a Diet Coke. For Trump, Acosta is the most insubordinate of all his employees\u2014somebody he fires daily in his mind. Acosta, who interprets all the attention he wins by rattling Trump\u2019s cage as evidence of his journalistic persistence, proceeds as if he\u2019s the shop steward who could never be canned. At the Wednesday presser, Acosta was prepared to conduct a sit-down strike if that was what was required to pin down Trump.\n\n\u201cI think that I should run the country and you run CNN,\u201d Trump growled, and cut him off. \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\n\nThe problem with Acosta\u2019s journalistic method is that when asking questions he rarely accomplishes enough to demonstrate whether he\u2019s a crusading, never-take-no-for-an-answer reporter or just a grandstander. As Trump repeatedly told Acosta \u201cthat\u2019s enough\u201d over his new attempted questions and the tension in the room escalated, a White House press aide approached Acosta to relieve him of the microphone. Thereafter followed a brief and awkward tug-of-war over the mic\u2014which Acosta won\u2014and segued into another question, this time about the Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cPut down the mic,\u201d Trump said. Continuing the sort of reprimand that precedes a sacking, Trump said, \u201cI will tell you that CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. And you are a rude and terrible person, and you should not be working for CNN.\u201d This chastisement did not quiet Acosta. Nor did Trump taking a question from another reporter who began by defending Acosta. \u201cWell, I am not a big fan of you, either,\u201d said the president. Acosta, still standing, attempted to verbally defend himself as Trump called him and his network a purveyor of fake news and an enemy of the people.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/3411/1155968404_5858951556001_5858950724001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nAnd so it continued, with Trump cutting off reporters and telling them to sit down or telling one reporter that her question about whether his statement about nationalism actually emboldened white nationalism was \u201cracist.\u201d Continued Trump when asked about allegations that he\u2019s used racist language, \u201cI don\u2019t use racist remarks. If I did, you people\u2014you would have known about it.\u201d\n\nThe clowning and buoyant Trump that we\u2019ve come to know so well from the MAGA rallies was absent from the presser except for two moments. In one, Trump spoke to his off-screen economic adviser Larry Kudlow as though Kudlow was Ed McMahon to his Johnny Carson\u2014\u201cWhere is Larry? You are a young man, right, Larry \u2026 \u201d Later, he turned a reporter\u2019s question about whether Mike Pence would repeat as his running mate in 2020 into a sort of reality-TV marriage proposal. He instructed Pence to stand and asked him if he would stay on the ticket. The answer was yes. All that was missing from the scene was the kiss cam.\n\nPicking up a recent theme of his invention, Trump accused the press of creating divisions in the country by asking questions like the one about white nationalism. When asked if he was going to follow-through on his promise to soften his tone, Trump again blamed the press. \u201cI really believe it begins with the media,\u201d he said, boxing himself into a sullen corner of nonresponsibility for his actions.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s mind, nothing is ever his fault, nothing is ever his responsibility, and no buck ever stops at his desk. What he wants and he needs and he gets from reporters like Acosta are the lines of dialogue that allow him to play the abused when he\u2019s usually the abuser. \u201cI do have the right to fight back because I\u2019m treated very unfairly,\u201d an exasperated Trump explained at the end of the presser. \u201cI do fight back, and I\u2019m fighting back not for me. I\u2019m fighting back for the people of this country.\u201d\n\nTrump was trying to sound heroic, patriotic and put-upon in his closing remarks. But when you\u2019re the star in a Punch and Judy show with reporters, it\u2019s hard to come off as anything but comic.\n\nAddendum: A few hours after the press conference, the Trump administration retaliated against Acosta by revoking his \"hard pass\" that allowed him to enter the White House grounds to do his 8 p.m. report on the day's events. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders justified the Acosta ban by falsely claiming that the CNN reporter had placed \"his hands on a young woman trying to do her job as a White House intern\" during the press conference in which the intern attempted to take the microphone from Acosta. It doesn't require Zapruderesque examination of the video to discern that Acosta didn't place his hand on the intern. Rather, he stood his ground when she attempted to wrestle it away from him. \"This is a lie,\" Acosta said of Sanders' accusation with uncommon--for him--brevity.\n\nThe Acosta exile, which will be difficult for the White House to legally enforce, accomplished at least two things for the president. It escalated Trump's crowd-pleasing \"war\" on the press and it disturbed for a few moments the news cycle, which was churning at top speed over the sacking of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the appointment of Matthew G. Whitaker as acting attorney general. In the coming days, as Acosta is reinstated, Trump's ginned up controversy will be seen as more war game than a real declaration of war.\n\n******\n\nHave me fired by sending a request for my resignation to Shafer.Politico@gmail.com. My email alerts grandstand. My Twitter feed showboats. My RSS feed refuses to vamp.\n\nJack Shafer is Politico\u2019s senior media writer.", "Opinion Donald Trump Says He\u2019s \u2018Never Used Racist Remarks.\u2019 I Know Different. His recent attacks on immigrants fit a pattern of bigoted behavior toward minorities I watched for years.\n\nJack O\u2019Donnell is the former president of Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino.\n\nOn Wednesday, the day after a midterm cycle dominated by President Trump\u2019s divisive fear-mongering about immigrants invading our country, I listened as he told another of the lies for which has become so notorious. During his White House news conference he said, \u201cI\u2019ve never used racist remarks.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nI know the real Trump better than most. For 3\u00bd years, I worked in almost daily contact with him at the highest levels of the Atlantic City casino empire over which he once held sway. I saw him treat black people and minorities as inferior. I heard him say vulgar, bigoted things and I rebuked him for them. But he did not quit. Indeed, he has continued it to this day.\n\nOthers who have known him, including his son Eric and former football player Herschel Walker insist he is not a racist. But I don\u2019t see how anyone who has watched him across the 40 or so years could conclude otherwise. After all, he has been so public about it.\n\nWe can go back to the start of his career in the early 1970s and the outrage he expressed when Trump and his father were charged by the federal government with discriminating against African-Americans in the rental housing they owned in New York City. Trump\u2019s response was to hire Roy Cohn, who then countersued, calling the Justice Department attorneys \u201cstorm troopers\u201d and \u201cGestapo.\u201d The Trumps ultimately agreed to integrate their buildings, but the Justice Department acknowledged they never really complied. Because they didn\u2019t want to. As Donald saw it, and I remember him voicing a version of this idea within the inner circle of his executives on several occasions : \u201cBlacks don\u2019t want to live with whites, so why isn\u2019t it OK for whites not to want to live with blacks?\u201d I know that in similar fashion he despised the affirmative action guidelines (50 percent female and 30 percent minority at every level) we were required to implement to maintain our gaming license. He would say it was not realistic and a waste of money to train people who did not have the ability.\n\nI recall one busy Saturday night, walking the casino floor with him, when he saw what he considered an inordinate number of black customers. \u201cIt\u2019s looking a little dark in here,\u201d he calmly stated. It was his way of telling me to limit our charter bus programs in urban neighborhoods. I ignored him and continued to run the business in the best interest of Donald, the bondholders and the employees.\n\nHis prejudices didn\u2019t stop at the color of one\u2019s skin. Everyone was subject to judgment. It could be their ethnicity, their gender, their religion. It could be their social \u201ccaste.\u201d Like the time we were speaking of the fiance\u0301e of one of our executives who had died in a tragic helicopter crash while returning to Atlantic City from a news conference with Donald in New York. The woman happened to be a cocktail server at the casino. Donald\u2019s take was, \u201cPoor girl. Her ticket out was Jon. She got lucky. Now she will be serving drinks the rest of her life..\n\nSometimes his petty prejudices begat very public tirades. One day , he flew into a rage over a limousine driver who arrived to pick him up wearing gray shoes, soiling his image by \u201clooking like a f------ Puerto Rican.\u201d\n\nIn 1988, shortly after I was promoted to president of Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino, he invited me up to New York for lunch. There was a lot to talk over one issue in particular: one of our senior managers, who happened to be African-American. Donald considered him incompetent and wanted him fired. When I acknowledged some shortcomings in the man\u2019s performance, he instantly became enthused. \u201cYeah, I never liked the guy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd isn\u2019t it funny, I\u2019ve got black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.\u201d\n\nI was mortified. We were in a restaurant in Trump Tower. I worried he\u2019d be overheard. But he went on, \u201cBesides that, I\u2019ve got to tell you something else: I think the guy is lazy, and it\u2019s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is. I believe that. It\u2019s not anything they can control.\u201d\n\nThen, eyeing me closely, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t you agree?\u201d\n\nWhen I told him in no uncertain terms that I did not, he swiped aside my objections with a chop of his hand. \u201cAh, it\u2019s a trait,\u201d he said.\n\nWhere did the bigotry come from? Was he possessed of some insatiable inner need for reassurance that there is a social order of which he occupies the pinnacle? Certainly, he was no less self-obsessed back then. No less brittle, mercurial, vindictive. I think it explains in no small part the reflexive ease with which he slinks into the most sordid identity politics whenever he feels threatened, as when he claimed the judge presiding over the federal lawsuits in the Trump University swindle, the American-born Gonzalo Curiel, was \u201cMexican\u201d and therefore biased against him. He\u2019s suggested the same of any Muslim judge. Knowing Donald, I\u2019m sure he wondered how a \u201cMexican\u201d came to be a judge in the first place.\n\nI quit working for him about a year before the first of his several corporate bankruptcies in 1991 and was long gone by the time he had completely sunk what had been a multibillion-dollar gaming business. Lenders and investors lost fortunes, contractors and small business owners were never paid, hardworking employees with families lost their jobs. The casualties\u2014in Atlantic City and beyond\u2014were many. I had little contact with Donald, but he thundered on, never missing a beat. The \u201cbrand\u201d not only survived, it flourished, and with it the myth of his entrepreneurial genius. Yet, had I thought about him at all during those years I wouldn\u2019t have discounted the possibility that he could change. Don\u2019t we all believe in that? I knew I was wrong when he seized upon the birther charade, casting himself as chief prosecutor in the shameful inquisition into the citizenship, academic achievements and work ethic of our first African-American president. Then there he was a few years later, preening in the lobby of Trump Tower amid a phalanx of American flags, launching his candidacy with a promise to build his now-infamous wall to protect us from Mexican criminals and \u201crapists.\u201d He hadn\u2019t changed at all.\n\nThe case has been made, and it\u2019s persuasive, that Trump isn\u2019t president in spite of his racism, but because of it. Do you remember how hard it was for him to denounce David Duke? \u201cI\u2019m the least racist person that you\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he has said. And he really believes this, because he believes we all think like him. After all, we proved this by electing him. But such is the mania of the ego we\u2019re confronted with, utterly incapable of seeing the world as anything but a reflection of itself.\n\nAnd if, as it appears, the law is bearing down on him for alleged violations of campaign finance laws and other crimes, for obstruction of justice, possibly for colluding with a hostile foreign power to subvert a presidential election , he will turn to the rhetoric of race with increasing frequency and virulence. Don\u2019t forget that twice he\u2019s refused to specifically condemn the racists and neo-Nazis who bloodied Charlottesville. And let\u2019s not forget his parade of other offenses: calling African nations \u201cshithole countries,\u201d; assailing black celebrities like LeBron James and politicians like Maxine Waters as \u201cdumb\u201d and \u201clow IQ\u201d ; calling NFL players who kneel in protest \u201csons of bitches.\u201d Should he find himself fighting for his political survival, I expect he will double- and triple-down on the support of an ascendant white nationalism that looks to him for endorsement.\n\nOn Wednesday, PBS \u201cNewsHour\u201d reporter Yamiche Alcindor, asked Trump about whether his self-description as a \u201cnationalist\u201d emboldened white supremacists. Trump shot back: \u201cI\u2019m not a racist. Your question is racist.\u201d\n\nMy experience tells me different.\n\nJack O\u2019Donnell is author of the memoir Trumped! The Inside Story of the Real Donald Trump His Cunning Rise and Spectacular Fall.\n\nThis article tagged under: Racism\n\nDonald Trump", "WILKINSON, W.Va.\u2014After he lost, the loudest, feistiest, most in-your-face congressional candidate in the country this year didn\u2019t credit his opponent. He blamed Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cTo the president of the United States, I did not lose this race because of Carol Miller!\u201d boomed Richard Ojeda, the buzz-cut, tattooed Army paratrooper turned populist Democrat. Technically, it was a concession speech he was delivering at a wedding venue called Special Occasions by Angie here in West Virginia\u2019s isolated, economically depressed, Trump-loving 3rd Congressional District. But it sounded much more like a counterattack. \u201cBecause of you, the people in southern West Virginia will have another voiceless representative that supports legislation that hurts our working-class citizens!\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHe wasn\u2019t done. \u201cOn several occasions, you came here to speak for Carol Miller! You called me a stone-cold crazy wacko and then you mispronounced the way I say my name! But make no mistake about it! You\u2019re going to know my name! I\u2019m Richard Ojeda! I\u2019m Richard Ojeda! I\u2019m Richard Ojeda, and I\u2019m not done fighting, and neither are we!\u201d he crescendoed, pointing from behind the lectern on the stage out to the now standing, shouting crowd of a couple hundred people. \u201cNeither are we! Sappers clear the way! Airborne all the way!\u201d\n\nThus concluded the improbable push for a seat on Capitol Hill for the man who took to pitching himself as \u201cThe New Face of the Democratic Party.\u201d That many people thought he even had a shot here was a function of his fiery, forthright, take-no-prisoners persona. The final result, though, was a face slap of local political reality. Trump won this district two years ago by just short of 50 points. Even Ojeda himself voted for Trump before quickly coming to regret it. And his combative energy in his campaign was no match in the end for an opponent who brandished her Trump endorsement by donning a red MAGA hat at the president\u2019s rallies but mostly lay low simply to let gravity prevail. Tuesday night\u2019s 12.8 percentage point margin marked a rather remarkable 31-point shift toward blue, but it was a deficit also noticeably larger than polling had predicted. Miller won with ease.\n\nLosing candidates don\u2019t admit defeat easily, and they seldom acknowledge missteps so soon after the votes have been tallied. But Ojeda, who pronounces his name oh-jed-uh, hard j, insisted to me even in the wake of the loss that he still believes how he ran his race should be a \u201cblueprint\u201d for how Democrats should run races in red states everywhere. He vowed to continue to be a voice and a force. He\u2019s still a state senator\u2014one with an above-average national profile. Nobody will be surprised if he runs again for Congress in 2020, and some here have bandied about his name as a potential gubernatorial candidate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not scared,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd he really did just start.\n\nAfter 24 years in the Army, Ojeda, 48, ran a quixotic campaign for Congress in 2014, losing handily in the primary. He was elected to the state Senate in 2016\u2014and as a novice lawmaker promptly spearheaded the passage of medical marijuana legislation. He intuitively saw the appeal of the drug to injured blue-collar workers and people wracked by opioid addiction, two kinds of people West Virginia has plenty of. He first piqued the wider interest of politicos and others around the country less than a year ago with a rousing 4-minute intro ad in which he lifted weights and laser-stared into the camera and gave out his cellphone number. But he really vaulted into the limelight by stoking the 55-county teacher strike in this state in the spring. He became, practically overnight, it seemed, a folk hero not only to he teachers but to members of unions of all kinds all over the state. He seemed to revive a style of Democratic politicking that was once common in the state, evoking West Virginia\u2019s laws-changing, rights-earning labor uprisings of the past. And it made hungry progressives here begin to believe. In his bid in this hard-red place, could he actually \u2026 win?\n\n\u201cOjeda oozes sincerity,\u201d said Ryan Frankenberry, executive director of the West Virginia Working Families Party. \u201cThere\u2019s not a bullshit bone in his body.\u201d\n\nWest Virginia University political scientist Scott Crichlow described to me the burgeoning Ojeda brand as \u201cgrab the torch.\u201d\n\nNational reporters flocked.\n\nBut strengths can be weaknesses, too, of course, and Ojeda\u2019s energetic, unadulterated, off-the-cuff style inspired support while also lending his opponents ample fodder for attack. Earlier this year, for instance, he agreed to an interview with famed liberal filmmaker Michael Moore for his anti-Trump documentary \u201cFahrenheit 11/9.\u201d It was something an even remotely circumspect politician in a deeply conservative district would not even have considered. And then Ojeda showed up in the movie\u2019s trailer, spitting dynamite. Twice. In two minutes. The first: \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of people telling me America is the greatest country\u2014because we can whip your ass?\u201d The second: \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit who you are. I\u2019ll fight you in the damn street right now.\u201d Even Moore appeared to not quite know how to respond. But Miller and her GOP allies certainly did. Fairly or not\u2014welcome to the big leagues\u2014Ojeda\u2019s comments let them question the veteran\u2019s patriotism and paint him as menacing and unbalanced. It worked. Stephen Noble Smith, a rising progressive star in the state, heard about it knocking on doors. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can vote for him because of that,\u201d people told him, he said.\n\nTrump personally did his best to finish Ojeda.\n\nMiller \u201cis running against a total wacko,\u201d the president told a crowd at a rally in Wheeling in late September. \u201cNow I\u2019ve seen this person. You can\u2019t have that person in Congress. That person is stone-cold crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cCarol\u2019s opponent,\u201d he said last week at his rally in Huntington, \u201cis a radical left-winger named Richard Ojeda.\u201d The people hooted and booed. And the Spanish-accented way Trump said Ojeda\u2019s name was conspicuous. Oh-HAY-da.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t fall for the garbage and the lies,\u201d Ojeda said to a Democratic get-out-the-vote gathering the next night at a pig roast in Peach Creek. \u201cMy military service has been attacked by people who have never picked up a rifle and manned a post.\u201d\n\nBut people in the 3rd District listen to the president.\n\nAlready, yard signs say TRUMP 2020. And catty-corner from Ojeda\u2019s campaign headquarters in Chapmanville? A tall and elaborate billboard of sorts, paid for by Republican state lawmaker Rupie Phillips, featuring unflattering pictures of Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, Maxine Waters and a bullhorn-toting Moore. \u201cNOjeda,\u201d it said. \u201cDeplorables \u2026 You MUST Vote!!!\u201d\n\nInside Ojeda\u2019s spartan headquarters, next to Big Eagle Gun & Pawn, notes of support from coast to coast adorned the otherwise barren walls. \u201cMake it count,\u201d one donor had written in blue ink on yellow paper. \u201cSave us.\u201d\n\nOjeda sat in an upstairs office early Tuesday afternoon. The man who frequently campaigned in combat boots and Grunt Style shirts instead wore an uncharacteristically conventional blue suit and red tie. But he talked the way he always talked. He let it rip. \u201cRichard Ojeda\u2019s not unhinged,\u201d Ojeda said. \u201cBecause if Richard Ojeda was unhinged, I\u2019d\u2019ve already smacked about 50 people in the mouth.\u201d\n\nHe unapologetically argued campaigns like his were the answer for Democrats in places like this.\n\nWho works here as a Democrat at this point?\n\n\u201cThe Democrat that is a real Democrat,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Democrat that says, \u2018Look, you\u2019re a working-class citizen, and I respect you. I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to protect you. I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to fight to make sure you have a seat at the table.\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is the blueprint,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is the blueprint for how we win across the United States of America. Everywhere. This is how you win in Middle America. It\u2019s talking about picking the people that can relate to the people. Don\u2019t talk about it. Be about it. Stand up for the working-class citizens. Stand up for our sick. Stand up for our veterans. Stand up for the elderly. Protect things like Social Security. Stop allowing people to stick their hands in the cookie jar. Create opportunities for people who live in poverty to elevate themselves out of poverty with a hand up, not a hand out. That\u2019s what being a Democrat is!\u201d\n\nA few hours later, though, at Special Occasions by Angie, Ojeda aide Madalin Sammons chain-smoked in the dark on the porch. She said she felt like she might vomit.\n\nThe returns were dispiriting from the start and never got better.\n\nBackers gamely responded with glass-half-full resolve.\n\n\u201cWhatever hill he\u2019s climbed here shows a Democratic message can still gain traction,\u201d Frankenberry said.\n\n\u201cOjeda has awakened a sleeping giant in southern West Virginia,\u201d added Nick Rahall, the Democrat who represented this district for nearly 40 years before losing in 2014 as the state all but finished the sweeping ideological shift from which only Senator Joe Manchin seems to be immune.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a victory for the people in West Virginia,\u201d Randy Jones, Ojeda\u2019s political director, told me, \u201cbecause we weren\u2019t even supposed to get close. When you align yourself with working class people, anywhere in the country, you can do something unexpected. This race, win or lose, has in some ways changed the fabric of the Democratic Party for the next 20 years.\u201d The key in his mind: an authentic, charismatic candidate, running on a populist, economy-oriented platform as opposed to toxic, divisive culture-war issues.\n\n\u201cBlueprint,\u201d Ojeda reiterated when I caught up with him after his concession speech.\n\nJourney of a thousand miles and single steps and whatnot. But still. \u201cScoreboard,\u201d I felt like saying.\n\nHe was, after all, the loser.\n\n\u201cHad the president not come down here and stuck his nose into this race,\u201d Ojeda said, \u201cI would be the winner.\u201d\n\nHe kept talking.\n\n\u201cI will tell you right now. I\u2019m not scared of the president of the United States. And I\u2019m not scared to stand up against the president of the United States. We\u2019re going to sit and think about what the way ahead is. I\u2019m not scared. I am not. I think that we need a voice that is willing to actually say what needs to be said,and I think there are a lot of things that need to be said. This country\u2019s not going down the right path. This country right now is going towards a path that should scare people. He is catering to the top 1 percent while absolutely turning his back on the bottom, the working class.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t stop.\n\n\u201cI cannot sit here and say I was beaten by Carol Miller. Because Carol Miller did not show up. She did not debate me. She basically avoided everything and just said, \u2018I\u2019m with Trump, I\u2019m with Trump.\u2019 And sadly, that\u2019s apparently a victory here in a place like southern West Virginia.\u201d\n\nOjeda finally wrapped up\u2014by giving future foes additional ammunition.\n\n\u201cPeople here,\u201d he said, \u201cwill vote against their best interests every time.\u201d\n\nMichael Kruse is a senior staff writer for Politico.", "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats could have lost nine or 10 seats in the chamber if the party hadn\u2019t executed on Tuesday. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo Congress Schumer: Trump is 'delusional' for claiming midterm wins\n\nChuck Schumer charged Wednesday that President Donald Trump is \u201cdelusional\u201d for claiming victory in the midterm elections, insisting that the Democratic Party is poised to compete for the Senate and presidency in 2020 despite losses in key Senate races.\n\nTrump cast the election as vindication for his campaign strategy, emphasizing the GOP\u2019s gains in the Senate and claiming that he had a \u201cvery close to complete victory\u201d despite dropping governors\u2019 seats and control of the House.

Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), the party\u2019s campaign chair, mentioned a potential path to the majority over the weekend and most Democrats were hoping to either pick up a seat or at least keep the Senate at its current 51-49 division. Instead Democrats got blown out in Tennessee, narrowly lost Texas and Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Donnelly of Indiana lost, with Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida demanding a recount while down by a narrow margin.\n\nThat makes it that much harder for Democrats to regain Senate control in 2020, though Democrats hold out hope that two close races will break their way.

The law allows him to share the material in private with other lawmakers on the panel and their staff.\n\nRudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s lawyer, has said he\u2019d urge Trump to fight the request. But it\u2019s unclear how that would play out if it went to court. The law stipulates the Treasury secretary \u201cshall\u201d turn over \u201cany return or return information\u201d requested by the heads of Congress\u2019 tax committees, or its nonpartisan tax advisory office, the Joint Committee on Taxation. \u201cSecretary Mnuchin will review any request with the Treasury general counsel for legality,\u201d an agency spokesperson said Wednesday.\n\nCan lawmakers make the information public once they have it?\n\nLawmakers can vote to make the information public. That would be highly unusual, though it wouldn\u2019t be unprecedented. A few years ago, Republicans voted to make private tax information about nonprofit groups public, though not individual taxpayers\u2019 returns, as part of an investigation into the IRS. Before that, Congress made public President Richard Nixon\u2019s tax information after questions about whether he had underpaid his taxes.\n\nHow quickly might we see something?\n\nDemocrats are prepared for the White House to order Treasury to refuse to release Trump\u2019s returns, forcing lawmakers to go to court to spring the returns. That could potentially take years, and some predict the administration will happily tie up the issue in court if only to delay the disclosure.\n\nOf course, Democrats could always retaliate by cutting Treasury\u2019s budget or by attaching riders into its annual appropriations \u2014 such as one preventing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin from using public money to travel.\n\nAre there risks for Democrats?\n\nIt\u2019s a felony to improperly disclose tax information, punishable up to five years in prison \u2014 one reason why tax returns rarely leak. Some warn Democrats will have to be careful handling Trump\u2019s returns. They would likely examine them in private for some time, while they try to understand Trump\u2019s finances, before releasing anything to the public. During that time, if Democrats answer a reporters\u2019 question, for example, in a way that reflects something they\u2019ve learned from his return, they could find themselves in legal jeopardy.\n\nNeal should not even bring Trump\u2019s returns to the Hill, and should instead visit them at the IRS in order to avoid leaks, said Janice Mays, a former longtime Democratic tax aide.\n\n\u201cI would recommend that he doesn\u2019t even take physical custody of them but leaves them at the IRS,\u201d said Mays, who was the panel\u2019s chief counsel and is now managing director of tax policy services at PwC. \u201cIf anything does get leaked, you\u2019ll be accused of being the leaker if you\u2019ve got it, so I\u2019d say go down and visit it \u2014 don\u2019t bring it to you.\u201d\n\nNeal may even have trouble discussing the issue even in general, once he\u2019s seen the returns, she said. \u201cAnything he says \u2014 people will read it into that he\u2019s seen the return and knows something,\u201d said Mays. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to go quiet, as is anybody who has access to them.\u201d\n\nOnce the Democrats have the returns, what could they do with them?\n\nThe first task for the committee would be understanding what the returns show. Trump\u2019s filings will surely be hugely complicated, and even the tax committees may not have the expertise to fully decipher them. They may need to hire outside investigators or perhaps tap the JCT to help them understand what they\u2019re looking at.\n\nCould there be financial consequences for Trump?\n\nIt depends what Democrats find. It didn\u2019t go well for Nixon when the JCT audited his returns at lawmakers\u2019 request in 1974. It took JCT four months to produce a report on Nixon\u2019s taxes that ran almost 1,000 pages \u2014 and determined that he owed almost $500,000, which amounted to half his net worth.", "Incoming House Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters could make life very difficult for big bank CEOs. | Alex Wong/Getty Images POLITICO Money Podcast What the 2018 election means for the economy and financial world\n\nSubscribe to POLITICO Money on Apple Podcasts here. | Subscribe via Stitcher here.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump is likely to try to cut infrastructure deals with Democrats in Congress while incoming House Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) could make life very difficult for big bank CEOs.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn the latest POLITICO Money podcast, POLITICO\u2019s Nancy Cook and Zachary Warmbrodt break down the 2018 midterm election results and what they mean for markets, the economy and the financial services industry.\n\nIn addition to seeking common ground on infrastructure spending next year with likely House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the White House is working on plans to expand domestic energy production through executive action rather than legislation.

Roscoe Bartlett under the old lines, has gone for the Democratic candidate in each election since, including electing David Trone \u2014 the self-funding Total Wine and More CEO who spent $18.2 million on this year\u2019s campaign \u2014 on Tuesday.\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court heard arguments about whether it should put a halt to this year\u2019s elections because the map was unfair to Republicans in the district. The case introduced the possibility that the justices would establish firm guidelines about just how far political actors, like governors and state legislators, can go in drawing congressional lines that maximize their party\u2019s advantage.\n\nInstead, the high court punted \u2014 ruling one week prior to the 2018 primaries that it was too late redraw Maryland's map this year and kicking the map back down to a lower court.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Martin O\u2019Malley, enacted a congressional map that violates the First Amendment rights of Republican voters in the 6th District. And even though the map has already been used for four elections, including on Tuesday, it cannot be used one final time in 2020, the judges wrote.\n\n\u201cBecause the State\u2019s enactment of the 2011 redistricting law violated the plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights, it is well recognized that the plaintiffs are, and will be, experiencing ongoing constitutional injury in the absence of a new redistricting map,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cAnd only an injunction mandating a new, lawful map, not money damages, can remedy this injury.\u201d\n\nThe three judges are James Bredar, who was appointed by then-President Barack Obama; Paul Niemeyer, appointed by Ronald Reagan; and George Levy Russell, also an Obama appointee.\n\nThe court is ordering Maryland to redraw two of the state\u2019s eight districts \u2014 the 6th and the 8th, currently held by Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin \u2014 prior to the state\u2019s 2020 primaries. Any changes to the state\u2019s map could disrupt the 7-to-1 advantage Democrats have enjoyed in Maryland's congressional delegation since the current map was enacted.\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who was reelected Tuesday by a robust, double-digit margin in the Democratic state, celebrated the ruling in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThis is a victory for the vast majority of Marylanders who want free and fair elections and the numerous advocates from across the political spectrum who have been fighting partisan gerrymandering in our state for decades,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cWith this unanimous ruling, the federal court is confirming what we in Maryland have known for a long time \u2014 that we have the most gerrymandered districts in the country, they were drawn this way for partisan reasons, and they violate Marylanders\u2019 constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nBut while Hogan praised the court\u2019s decision, any appeal \u2014 which could go directly back to the Supreme Court \u2014 would come from Democratic state Attorney General Brian Frosh\u2019s office. A spokesperson said Wednesday that Frosh\u2019s office \u201cis looking at options\u201d but declined to comment further.", "We are two former White House political directors\u2014one of us, Doug Sosnik, worked for Bill Clinton; one of us, Sara Fagen, worked for George W.

Lobbyists have been preparing for months for the possibility that House Democrats would launch investigations that might ensnare their clients if they retook the House, although there\u2019s disagreement about how aggressively Democrats will go after corporate America. \u201cI think the whole investigations thing is overplayed by the press,\u201d said Steve Elmendorf, a prominent lobbyist and former Democratic congressional staffers. The companies that have the most to worry about are those that sought favors from the Trump administration during its first two years \u2014 proof of which could be discovered in the expected investigations into the administration. \u201cAnybody who had any contact with this administration should be worried about what that contact was,\u201d he said.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2014 Jeff Forbes, another Democratic lobbyist and a co-founder of the lobbying firm Forbes Tate Partners, warned that overly aggressive investigations could hurt Democrats\u2019 chances in 2020. \u201cIf that\u2019s a path we go down, that\u2019s a path to rental of the House for the next two years,\u201d he said.\n\nDEFEATED MEMBERS WHO HEAD TO K STREET WILL HAVE COMPANY: Dozens of members of Congress will retire in January by choice or because they were defeated last night, and if history is any guide, some of them will head to K Street. Ivan Adler, a headhunter who specializes in lobbying, said he\u2019d already talked with more than a dozen retiring members of Congress by Election Day.\n\n\u2014 Some context: At least nine members who lost their seats or decided not to run for reelection in 2016 have become lobbyists, according to PI\u2019s tally. They include former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), who\u2019s now at Mercury, and former Reps.

Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck\u2019s Nadeam Elshami and Brian McGuire write in their post-election analysis to expect from House Democrats \u201ccooperation on infrastructure, a continuation of efforts to lower prescription drug prices, and movement on data security and privacy, among other priority issues.\u201d In addition, they predict that Democrats will push measures dealing with immigration, health care, and renewable energy. Such proposals will need to be negotiated into must-pass legislation.

Such a move threatens the law's patient protections as well as the Medicaid expansion that covers tens of millions of people.\n\nHouse and Senate Republicans who previously voted to roll back protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions rushed to introduce legislation before the election supporting the safeguards. But the House measures were non-binding resolutions, while the Senate bill was crafted in a way that would have allowed insurers to refuse to cover the costs of treating some conditions. Any court decision to gut those protections could prompt efforts to reinstate some safeguards.\n\nAfter a decade's worth of bruising health care battles, newly ascendant House Democrats are skeptical bipartisanship is possible on this issue. They anticipate Republicans still in control of the Senate would demand a host of unacceptable conservative policy concessions in exchange for their votes to restore patient protections.\n\n\"So far during the Trump administration, there\u2019s been a predictable pattern: Democrats have been willing to work together across party lines to make health care markets work better, while Republicans have been, at most, interested in using health care as a hostage in negotiations,\" said a senior Democratic aide. \"It would be great to see that dynamic change in the next Congress, but I\u2019m not holding my breath.\"\n\nDemocrats say they plan an aggressive double-edged strategy in the House \u2014 investigating Trump administration actions that chipped away at the Affordable Care Act and pushing legislation to strengthen health insurance markets, rein in drug prices and address the opioid epidemic.\n\n\u201cThe Energy and Commerce Committee will follow through on Democrats\u2019 commitment to lower health care and prescription drug costs for consumers,\u201d said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), who's in line to take the chairmanship of the influential House panel.\n\nDemocrats are expected to hit the Trump administration with a barrage of investigations, many focused on health care. That would put high-ranking officials in the position of defending unpopular policies aimed at weakening the health law, while likely chilling more administrative efforts to do the same.\n\nHealth care will be a big part of the investigative agenda, House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) told POLITICO. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at these efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, looking at the effort to take away the pre-existing condition protections.\u201d\n\nThe letters Democratic committee heads have sent to the administration over the past two years provide a road map to what they will tackle now that they hold subpoena power, according to aides. They include demands for information on the HHS\u2019 role in detaining migrant children separated from their parents, on the Trump administration\u2019s decision to back red states\u2019 anti-ACA lawsuit and on efforts to roll back Obamacare\u2019s contraception mandate.\n\nSteny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, said the new majority plans to call top administration health officials to testify.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going after pre-existing conditions in the courts,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve authorized [short-term] junk plans, which are a pretense of health care security, and are allowing those policies to be extended from 90 days to 364. The [cost-sharing reductions] they\u2019ve undermined, the family planning programs they\u2019ve clearly gone after, the shortened open enrollment period, where they\u2019ve eliminated the budget for informing the American people about what their options are. We need to have hearings about all of that.\u201d\n\nOutside liberal groups that work with Democrats on health policy say the oversight blitz will serve multiple functions.\n\n\"There\u2019s a serious, real need for this but, also, it is a kind of classic way to gum up the works in the administration,\" said Shawn Gremminger, senior director of federal relations at the liberal health advocacy group Families USA. \"If you keep them busy enough, it keeps them from necessarily rolling out a lot more.\"\n\nGremminger also anticipates the planned investigations will trigger turnover at HHS and other federal agencies.\n\n\"It would not be at all surprising if a lot of senior administration people working in our space say, \u2018All right, I\u2019m done,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe prospect of spending most of your days going between subcommittee hearings to testify \u2014 I think most people just aren\u2019t interested in doing that.\"\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle also say they want to do more on drug pricing and take further steps to address the opioid epidemic. They may also revisit some version of the legislation that failed last year that would have shored up Obamacare individual markets and lowered consumer premiums.\n\nIncremental changes, like increasing transparency around drugmakers\u2019 relationships with pharmacy benefit managers to avoid collusion to keep prices high, could get bipartisan support. The expansive Medicare Part B drug payment pilot that the administration rolled out also is likely to get more support from congressional Democrats than Republicans.\n\nHowever, Democrats are not likely to find any support across the aisle for government negotiation of drug prices, but they will continue to hammer this popular liberal demand ahead of the 2020 election. The parties may be able to work together, however, on bills to shine a light on drug companies\u2019 relationships with pharmacy benefit managers and crack down on any collusion that keeps prices high.\n\nAdam Cancryn and Sarah Karlin-Smith contributed to this report.", "\u201cI will tell you that CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them,\u201d President Donald Trump said to Jim Acosta on Wednesday. | AP Photo/Evan Vucci White House Trump shifts spotlight from midterms, escalating attacks on media In the longest news conference of his presidency, he went after reporters in sharply personal terms.\n\nIn an hour and 26 combative minutes on Wednesday, President Donald Trump declared CNN reporter Jim Acosta an \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d said he didn\u2019t much care for NBC reporter Peter Alexander, either, told American Urban Radio Networks correspondent April Ryan to \u201csit down,\u201d and accused Yamiche Alcindor of \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d of asking a question that was \u201cracist.\u201d Three times.\n\nIn case there were any questions over whether Trump would soften his tone after the Democratic takeover of the House on Tuesday, in the news conference he delivered his most strident and personal attacks on the press \u2014 a high bar for a president who has declared war on the media from Day One. Trump has often used his fights with journalists to shift the agenda from less favorable subjects \u2014 like midterm election losses \u2014 and Wednesday\u2019s event was a clear indicator that he was ready to turn the volume on his attack up past 11 to 12 and even higher in the second half of his term.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nLater Wednesday night, the Trump administration hit those new heights when it suspended Acosta\u2018s press pass for clearly fabricated reasons. It was a move without precedent in recent memory and one seemingly designed to distract from the president\u2018s decision earlier in the day to oust Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nThe action against Acosta stemmed from the news conference, the longest of Trump\u2019s presidency, when the CNN reporter, a frequent Trump sparring partner who has become well known for his back-and-forths with the president, asked a question about Trump\u2019s rhetoric on the migrant caravan currently in Mexico.\n\nTrump replied\u201d \u201cI think you should let me run the country.

You shouldn\u2019t treat people that way.\u201d\n\nWhen NBC reporter Peter Alexander, who had the next question, tried to defend Acosta\u2019s character, Trump said: \u201cWell I\u2019m not a big fan of yours, either. You aren\u2019t the best.\u201d\n\nAt this point, Acosta rose again, without the microphone and continued speaking to the president.

Her statement wasn\u2019t based in truth, however: Video replays clearly show that Acosta did not touch the assistant in any inappropriate manner.\n\nBut at the news conference, the president was just getting warmed up with Acosta. When April Ryan tried to break in later with a question about voter suppression, Trump pointed at her and said: \u201cSit down, please. Sit down. I didn\u2019t call you.\u201d\n\nThe exchange continued a bit longer \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not responding to you,\u201d Trump said \u2014 before the president lamented: \u201cSuch a hostile media. It\u2019s so sad.\u201d\n\nThe most startling exchange came toward the end of the news conference when Alcindor began a question, saying, \u201cOn the campaign trail you called yourself a nationalist. Some people saw that as emboldening white nationalists.\u201d\n\nTrump interrupted her, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019d say that. It\u2019s such a racist question.\u201d\n\nAfter allowing Alcindor to finish, Trump said, \u201cWhy do I have my highest poll numbers ever with African Americans?\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThat\u2019s such a racist question. Honestly, I mean, I know you have it written down and you\u2019re going to tell me. Let me tell you, that\u2019s a racist question. I love \u2014 you know what the word is \u2014 I love our country.

But to say that, what you said is so insulting to me. It\u2019s a very terrible thing that you said.\u201d\n\nFollowing the news conference, CNN, which has grown more aggressive under network president Jeff Zucker in challenging Trump, sent a statement to reporters.\n\n\u201cThis President\u2019s ongoing attacks on the press have gone too far,\u201d it read. \u201cThey are not only dangerous, they are disturbingly un-American. While President Trump has made it clear he does not respect a free press, he has a sworn obligation to protect it. A free press is vital to democracy, and we stand behind Jim Acosta and his fellow journalists everywhere.\u201d\n\nReporters on Twitter rallied, particularly to Alcindor\u2019s support.\n\n\u201c @Yamiche asked a fair and important question about whether Trump\u2019s embrace of the \u2018nationalist\u2019 label is an embrace of \u2018white nationalism,\u2019\u201d Washington Post White House reporter Philip Rucker said in one typical tweet .\n\nNotably, when Trump went after Alcindor, she did not take the bait, pressing on with her question. \u201cI followed up the president calling my question \u2018racist\u2019 with a policy question about his proposed middle class tax cut because that's what journalists do,\u201d she tweeted . \u201cWe press on. We focus on the privilege of asking questions for a living. We do the work.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the media was not so focused.\n\nOne veteran White House reporter told POLITICO that he was mostly struck with how effective the president\u2019s strategy had been in distracting from the actual news of the day.\n\n\u201cWhat is the coverage now? What is the coverage right now?\u201d the reporter asked, pointing to a post-news-conference CNN chyron reading, \u201cTRUMP NEWS CONFERENCE TURNS CONTENTIOUS WITH REPORTERS.\u201d\n\nInstead of talking about Trump\u2019s setbacks in the midterms or what investigations may be coming down the pike, the reporter noted that the CNN panel was discussing the food fight Trump had started himself.\n\n\u201cThe more interesting thing here,\u201d the reporter added, \u201cis that he has changed the conversation.\u201d\n\n", "Kansas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Laura Kelly's win Tuesday broke up a GOP \"trifecta\" in the state \u2014 control of both state legislative houses and the governorship. | Charlie Riedel/AP Photo Elections Dems gain governors but GOP keeps several big states ahead of redistricting battles\n\nDemocrats flipped governorships in seven states Tuesday, installing governors poised to play key roles in the next redistricting process in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 but Republicans held onto several major states, giving no party a clear leg up two years ahead of the census.\n\nHaunted by their losses at the state level in 2010 and the years after, Democrats made redistricting a key organizing principle of the midterm elections, using the specter of political mapmaking to draw attention to state-level races and launching a new group, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, to direct money to key races. Democratic wins in Kansas and Wisconsin broke up Republican \"trifectas\" \u2014 control of both state legislative houses and the governorship \u2014 in those states, while gains in Illinois, Maine, Nevada, and New Mexico gave Democrats full control over state government there.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nColorado and Michigan also passed ballot measures, supported by the NDRC, that transferred redistricting power from legislators and governors to independent commissions. (Democrats also elected new governors in both states, ending unified GOP control over Michigan's state government.) The results represent progress for Democrats since 2010, when Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 along with Pennsylvania, where Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf was reelected \u2014 were three states where GOP-controlled redistricting after the 2010 census hit Democrats especially hard, but Tuesday's results guaranteed Republicans won't have unified control in those states this time. Another ballot measure to establish a redistricting commission in Utah is too close to call.\n\nBut Democratic gubernatorial candidates fell short in Ohio and Florida, with dozens of congressional districts between them, and Democrat Stacey Abrams currently trails in Georgia, though her campaign believes late-counted ballots could lead to a December runoff. The Republican Party has trifectas in all three of those states. And reelection wins by Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan could give Republicans a seat at the table in those Democratic-dominated states during the next redistricting process.\n\nWolf's reelection preserved Democrats' hold on at least one lever of power in his state, where Republicans control the state legislature, while Minnesota Gov.-elect Tim Walz's win also kept Democrats in power in a fast-changing state. Republicans flipped two Democratic-held congressional districts at opposite ends of Minnesota in the midterms, while Democrats flipped two Republican-held seats in the Minneapolis suburbs.\n\nRepublican governors elected throughout the South ensure that the GOP will continue to have a strong hand in district mapmaking there.\n\nFormer attorney general Eric Holder launched the NDRC in early 2017, pledging to make state races a priority for the party.\n\n\u201cFixing this redistricting problem will involve not just focusing on the lines, but focusing on the larger effort to win back governance,\u201d Holder said at the time. \u201cThis is the path to ensuring Democrats have their rightful seats at the table in 2021.\u201d\n\nRepublicans also launched a redistricting group of their own, the National Republican Redistricting Trust, though that group has stayed more focused on data-gathering and litigation, leaving state-level politicking to existing Republican organizations.", "Sessions speaks during a news conference at the Justice Department on March 2, 2017, after announcing he will recuse himself from a federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

According to people familiar with the thinking, the White House's preference is to tap a permanent replacement who is already Senate confirmed, like Labor Secretary Alex Acosta. Acosta, however, is reluctant to take the job before the Mueller report is issued.\n\nOther high-profile names have surfaced in recent days as possible Sessions' replacements, including Kris Kobach, the controversial Kansas secretary of state \u2014 and strong Trump ally \u2014 who lost a gubernatorial bid on Tuesday.\n\nBut Joe diGenova, an informal Trump legal adviser who nearly joined the president\u2019s personal legal team earlier this year, shot down the Kobach speculation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d not consider him someone that\u2019d be ready to take over a job like that,\u201d diGenova told POLITICO.\n\nInstead, he suggested Trump consider tapping Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and current member of the president\u2019s legal team. Giuliani turned down the attorney general post during Trump's transition in the hopes of landing secretary of State.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d know how to clean house, which it desperately needs,\u201d diGenova said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen one way or another. It\u2019s just a matter of who does it.\u201d\n\nIn a text message to POLITICO on Wednesday, Giuliani appeared to take himself out of the running.\n\n\u201cJoe is a good friend, but I\u2019m not a candidate,\u201d he said.\n\nAs an outspoken advocate of the president\u2019s positions on the Mueller probe, Giuliani would almost certainly draw calls for his recusal. But diGenova fired back that loyalty to a president hasn\u2019t precluded others from having the job.\n\n\u201cBobby Kennedy was the president\u2019s brother. He\u2019s more qualified than Bobby Kennedy was,\u201d diGenova said of Giuliani.\n\n\u201cOnce you get past Rudy then you get into the leftovers,\u201d he added.\n\nA pair of Giuliani associates told POLITICO on Wednesday they wouldn\u2019t rule out his potential appointment to the attorney general slot.\n\n\u201cHe feels a strong loyalty to the president,\u201d said Jon Sale, a former federal prosecutor and law school classmate of Giuliani\u2019s. \u201cIf the president asked, I don\u2019t think he say \u2018no.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOne big case to resolve first,\u201d said Tony Carbonetti, a longtime Giuliani adviser, referring to the Mueller probe. \u201cThat should be done before anything else.\u201d\n\nCarbonetti said he spoke with the former New York mayor earlier Wednesday just before the news broke about Sessions. Giuliani made no mention of the attorney general opening, he said.\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge, they\u2019ve not had that conversation,\u201d he said.\n\nSome Trump allies think Whitaker might work his way into the job.\n\n\"If he proves himself capable, he can probably end up with the job full time,\u201d said former Trump campaign adviser Barry Bennett, who insisted that Whitaker's past commentary wouldn't prevent him from serving as a capable boss to Mueller.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal also reported last month that Trump was considering five potential replacements for Sessions: Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Transportation Department general counsel Steven Bradbury, former George H.W. Bush Attorney General William Barr, Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan and Janice Rogers Brown, a retired judge from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s appointment could also be subject to legal challenges, lawyers said. Trump used a 1998 law, the Vacancies Reform Act, to install Whitaker in the attorney general slot on an acting basis. However, another, older statute specifies the order of succession at the Justice Department as automatically elevating the deputy attorney general when the attorney general\u2019s post becomes vacant.\n\nThat law doesn\u2019t mention as a potential successor the attorney general\u2019s chief of staff, who is not Senate-confirmed.\n\nThe issue of how much authority the president has to make temporary appointments at the Justice Department has been unresolved for years. In 2001, White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales issued a memo saying the president lacked such authority unless the order of succession in the DOJ-focused law was exhausted. But in 2007, the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel took the opposite view, concluding that the president could use the newer Vacancies Reform Act to bypass the succession order. If Trump manages to quickly nominate and confirm a successor to Sessions, the issue could be moot.\n\n\u201cBy the time someone challenges it and it went to court, it may be a while,\u201d said Marty Lederman, a Georgetown law professor and former Justice Department official. He added that a legal challenge might have more traction if Whitaker remains in the post for a protracted period and if Trump doesn't seem to be trying to confirm a replacement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really uncertain who would have the standing to challenge and what the prospects would be for what a court would ultimately do,\" Lederman said.\n\nThe DOJ tumult is also guaranteed to cause a heated Senate debate when Trump eventually taps a permanent replacement for Sessions.\n\nIn February 2016, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions campaigns for Donald Trump in Madison, Ala. | John Bazemore/AP Photo\n\nSessions\u2019 departure comes as no surprise. The attorney general has been weathering verbal attacks from the president for moer than a year.\n\nA Republican close to the White House said that Sessions actually submitted a letter of resignation more than a year ago. When Trump didn\u2019t immediately use it, Sessions asked for it back. It\u2019s unclear whether an undated letter of resignation released Wednesday is the same letter or a different one.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately inform staffers of Sessions\u2019 firing. A DOJ employee told POLITICO that they found out when their supervisor sent their office a link to Trump\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cThere is no communication from leadership,\u201d said the employee, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cWe are apparently expected to monitor Trump's Twitter feed for his fiats.\u201d\n\nSome DOJ employees were unhappy that they didn't get to say goodbye to Sessions since his resignation took effect immediately, according to a DOJ official.\n\n\"We love him, so it\u2019s sad to see him go,\" the official said.\n\nThe official also added that DOJ employees had \"developed a thick skin\" and gotten used to the \"new normal\" of Trump's attacks on Sessions.\n\nIndeed, Trump has spent months using Twitter and media interviews to savage the 71-year old former senator of Alabama over his decision to recuse himself from overseeing his department\u2019s probe into Kremlin meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. In an interview last summer with Hill.TV, the president took it a step further when he complained that he didn\u2019t \u201chave an attorney general.\u201d\n\nStill, Sessions\u2019 resignation from the Trump Cabinet marks a dramatic turnaround for one of the president\u2019s earliest endorsers and most vocal 2016 campaign surrogates. Sessions abandoned a Senate seat he\u2019d held for two decades to join Trump\u2019s administration as its top law enforcement official.\n\nHe was more than an early political supporter. Sessions helped launch some of the earliest intellectual and ideological strains that Trump would embrace as a presidential candidate with no campaign experience, latching on to the then-senator\u2019s views as a longtime advocate for curtailing immigration, legal and illegal alike.\n\nOnce in Trump\u2019s administration, Sessions remained an ardent law-and-order conservative even as the criminal justice reform movement gained ground among his fellow Republicans and within the president\u2019s inner circle.\n\n\"In my time as Attorney General we have restored and upheld the rule of law \u2014 a glorious tradition that each of us has a responsibility to safeguard,\" Sessions wrote in his resignation letter to the president.\n\nSessions\u2019 Republican brand of populism could be seen infusing Trump\u2019s earliest messages on the campaign trail. Two of his aides became key parts of the president\u2019s staff: Rick Dearborn, who served through last March as deputy White House chief of staff and Stephen Miller, who remains a senior adviser and architect for some of the president\u2019s most controversial policies.\n\nAt Justice, Sessions will be remembered for his work to roll back many of the department\u2019s Obama-era initiatives and to enhance the focus on combating gangs and cracking down on sanctuary cities. All were policies Trump touted as administration accomplishments, although rarely with Sessions at his side.\n\nEarly in his tenure, Sessions took steps to seek tougher sentences against those accused of drug crimes, reversing a policy Attorney General Eric Holder instituted in 2013 that instructed prosecutors to omit any mention of drug quantity in formal charging documents as a way to get around mandatory minimum sentences.\n\nSessions took a similar approach to immigration. He sought to expand and streamline the immigration courts and rescinded legal precedents providing asylum protections to those fleeing gang-related violence. And he endorsed and helped implement the controversial \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy that led to the chaotic separation of more than 2,000 immigrant children from their parents at the border.\n\nWhile the White House denied it was pursuing a policy of \"family separation,\" Sessions leaned into the strategy, telling conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, \u201cyou can\u2019t be giving immunity to people who bring children with them recklessly and improperly and illegally.\u201d\n\nSome of Sessions\u2019 immigration-focused policies ran into serious resistance in the courts, including an effort to withhold federal grants from so-called sanctuary cities. A series of judges ruled that the new limits usurped the role of Congress in dictating the terms of federal funding.\n\nSessions also became a quick favorite of police chiefs and sheriffs, many of whom praised his decision to retreat from Obama-era cases alleging that some police departments were infected by pervasive racism and excessive use of deadly force. Warning against politicians who \u201crun down police,\u201d the attorney general suggested a small number of rogue officers were to blame for problems of bias and unwarranted violence against suspects.\n\nEven when he was barely on speaking terms with the president, Sessions often peppered his public speeches with half a dozen or more references to Trump.\n\nSessions boasted that under Trump's leadership, DOJ had reached \u201cunprecedented success at effectuating the president's agenda.\"\n\nBut none of it was enough to save the embattled attorney general\u2019s job.\n\nSessions\u2019 early decision to recuse himself from the FBI\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election \u2014 months before Mueller\u2019s appointment \u2014 marked his doom. It was a move grounded in precedent and DOJ guidelines, given Sessions\u2019 outspoken role as a Trump surrogate in a bitterly fought White House campaign that was being investigated even before Election Day.\n\nThe calls for his recusal came as Sessions faced withering criticism from Democrats when it was revealed he had not told Congress about meetings with Russian officials during the campaign. That decision enraged Trump.\n\n\u201cThe Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn\u2019t tell me he was going to recuse himself...I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter in June 2018.\n\nSessions\u2019 recusal paved the way for the eventual appointment of Mueller, whose 18-month-old investigation continues to cloud Trump\u2019s presidency as it has scored guilty pleas from top former Trump aides Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates.\n\nDespite playing no role in the ongoing investigation, Sessions faced constant pressure from Trump to end the probe. Trump accused Sessions of slow-walking document releases related to the probe and fumed about DOJ and FBI officials who he saw as adversarial to his White House.\n\nIn private, the president even reportedly referred to Sessions as the cartoon character \u201cMr. Magoo.\u201d\n\nSessions mostly has taken the blows, even as lawmakers and others in Trump\u2019s orbit defended him during key parts of his tenure.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s abuse did get under Sessions\u2019 skin. In May 2017, the attorney general drafted and sent his resignation letter to the White House shortly after Mueller\u2019s appointment as special counsel and following a blowout argument between the two men in the Oval Office, according to a New York Times report.\n\nSessions \u201cwould later tell associates that the demeaning way the president addressed him was the most humiliating experience in decades of public life,\u201d the Times reported.\n\nEric Geller, Eliana Johnson, Daniel Lippman, Josh Gerstein, Nancy Cook and Elana Schor contributed to this report.", "Sen.

But Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the 2016 Democratic primary challenger, clearly retains a strong hold on Vermont voters \u2014 he won with 67.4 percent of the vote. A close second to Sanders was New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who netted 66.6 percent. Gillibrand ran well ahead of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was elected to a third term with 59 percent.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren won Tuesday by a huge margin \u2014 she received 60 percent of the vote, compared with Republican Geoff Diehl\u2019s 36 percent. But Warren\u2019s performance still trailed seven points behind GOP Gov. Charlie Baker, who captured 66.6 percent.\n\nOther 2020 prospects on the ballot this year were in the same range as Warren: Sen. Amy Klobuchar won with 60 percent in Minnesota, while in Virginia, Tim Kaine won with 57 percent.\n\nThe shape of the 2020 map\n\nDemocrats will be sifting through the wreckage that is Florida and Ohio for weeks to come. On Tuesday, they were unable to make sense of how to reclaim these states from Trump.\n\nAnd for all of the talk of an impending Midwest blowout, Democrats were unable to win statewide in Iowa, despite an influx of money and resources \u2014 much of it from the 2020 candidates themselves.\n\nBut Democrats did make significant advances in Wisconsin, where Tony Evers was able to knock off Gov. Scott Walker, and in Michigan, where Democrats also picked up a GOP-held governorship.\n\n\u201cTrump has to bank on breaking the blue wall again and, despite Republican attempts, Democrats won their federal races in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania,\u201d said Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson. In addition, Ferguson said Democrats snagged half a dozen other congressional seats that had flipped from President Barack Obama to Trump.\n\n\u201cThe idea that Republicans had forever taken these blue-wall voters from us just doesn't hold up,\u201d Ferguson said Tuesday night. \u201cWe have to work for it, but tonight proves we can win them back if we focus on all the ways that Trump has sold out people who work for a living.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a bright spot in the Northeast, too. In New Hampshire, the first primary state, Democrats took control of the state\u2019s two legislative chambers and won both congressional seats.\n\n\u201cI can tell you if change is going to take place, maybe New Hampshire is the right place for the presidential process to begin,\u201d said longtime New Hampshire-based Democratic strategist Jim Demers, crediting the state\u2019s success with female and youth turnout. \u201cNew Hampshire bucked the system and had a really strong election for Democrats.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 branding problem\n\nWhile Nancy Pelosi was claiming victory for Democrats on Tuesday, some Midwestern leaders worried she was missing the bigger picture: Democrats could win in individual districts, but their messages, which focused largely on health care in House races, weren\u2019t resonating statewide.\n\nDemocrats hold up Trump\u2019s messaging on immigration, including using scare tactics on a migrant caravan heading through Mexico, as a way he roused his base \u2014 and Democrats don\u2019t have an effective response yet on the issue.\n\nDavid Betras, a Democratic county chairman in Youngstown, Ohio, where Democrats suffered an across-the-board beat down Tuesday, said the bigger problem is that Democrats are still in search of an opposing voice who has as big a microphone as Trump\u2019s. And he argued that some Democrats nationally don\u2019t help when they move too far to the left. The suggestion to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Betras argued, only feeds into Trump\u2019s rhetoric and animates his voters.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic brand on a national level is ruined. It\u2019s ruined because the national Democrats are trying to run for the governor of New York and California instead of trying to appeal to the middle swath of America,\u201d he said. \u201cDonald Trump is running in six states. We\u2019re running to be the governor of New York and California. He\u2019s playing four-dimensional chess and we\u2019re playing checkers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people here think the Democratic Party left them,\u201d Betras said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not that wrong.\u201d\n\nThe not-so-invisible primary\n\nThey haven\u2019t formally announced they\u2019re running, of course, but 2020 hopefuls started their campaigns months ago. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sanders, Warren and Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) all knew that if they wanted to launch a presidential bid, they needed to roll up their sleeves and pitch in on this year\u2019s most competitive campaigns. The result? Early presidential states like Nevada, South Carolina and Iowa were high-traffic zones, with each candidate trying to outperform the other.\n\nTom Steyer, the progressive billionaire who funded NextGen, a nationwide youth voter registration and engagement effort, was in a league of his own. Steyer reported dumping $120 million into the midterm elections, and his group reported registering more than 257,000 young voters on more than 400 college campuses.\n\nThe five top-tier Democrats with 2020 ambitions were also heavily invested, delivering a $27 million haul, in total, to the candidates for whom they were campaigning this cycle. That financial push was on top of marshaling resources and staff for gubernatorial or down ballot candidates. Harris topped the bunch by raising and donating a combined $9 million, with Warren at $8 million, Booker at $7 million and Sanders at $2.6 million. Biden\u2019s camp did not calculate fundraising numbers, but his PAC doled out more than $500,000. Plenty of other Democrats put in campaigning and fundraising work too, including the already announced presidential candidate Maryland Rep. John Delaney, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio and Govs. Steve Bullock of Montana and Jay Inslee of Washington, among others.\n\nStandouts for state visits were Booker and Biden, each of whom traveled to 24 states to campaign for other candidates. Sanders visited 18 states, Harris visited 15 and Warren visited 11. Only Warren skipped Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nBooker may have gone the extra mile, though. In a night marked by Senate defeats, New Jersey's junior senator can point to his role in helping his home-state colleague, Robert Menendez, fend off an upset. Booker served as perhaps the top surrogate as the embattled senior senator clawed his way to reelection. Booker also went in big for Michelle \u201cMikie\u201d Sherrill, who won an open New Jersey congressional seat held by Republicans for 30 years.\n\nThe makeup of the field\n\nThe recent controversy over Michael Avenatti\u2019s remarks about the Democrats\u2019 2020 nominee \u2014 he \u201cbetter be a white male,\u201d said the Los Angeles attorney \u2014 reopened a painful, post-Hillary Clinton discussion about gender and presidential politics. While Avenatti said the remarks were taken out of context, he still raised the question as to whether voters are ready for a woman as the Democratic nominee against Trump.\n\nTuesday\u2019s results took a big stride toward answering it. Democrats put female candidates front and center in the House, where Democratic women registered most of the historic gains, and also in governors races, where four female first-time candidates won Tuesday. All of that should be powerful evidence that the half-dozen or so women who are considering a presidential bid won\u2019t suffer either in the primary or the general election.\n\n", "If Nancy Pelosi cements her place as the next House speaker, she'll need to work with colleagues to parcel out coveted backbench committee slots to her significantly expanded caucus. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo Congress Dems itching for Trump investigations face a slog Committee veterans warn it could take months before Democrats are able to get traction.\n\nDemocrats who surged to power in the House are salivating over subpoena power and a long menu of potential investigations to cudgel President Donald Trump and his administration.\n\nBut anticipation of a blue wave of subpoenas is about to meet reality: it could be months before Democrats launch their most high-profile investigations, and even longer before they get results.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cOne of the misimpressions is that things start as soon as the election is over,\u201d a senior Democratic official familiar with Democratic leaders' oversight plans. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works.\u201d\n\nThat's sure to be a point of contention for a Democratic base hungry to put Trump and his administration under a microscope after two years of accusing Republicans of shirking their responsibility to hold the president accountable.\n\nHouse staffers and veterans of previous oversight investigations warn that staffing up the committees \u2014 the spoils of a Democratic House takeover \u2014 will be a long and arduous process. And that's just one challenge.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know. Follow our presidential election coverage.

The committees will need to fight for their share of a limited congressional budget, and they'll have to prioritize the timing of their highest-profile investigations to ensure they don't drown each other out.\n\nSome leadership staffers would prefer to see committee chairmen, for example, spend weeks building a public case to force Trump's tax returns into the open or subpoena records from his business. Add to that the uncertain timing of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation \u2014 a sprawling probe that could ensnare Trump or his allies in allegations of wrongdoing \u2014 and Democrats may be doing more waiting than investigating when they take control of the House on Jan. 3.\n\nTrump, too, seems to be girding for the clash, warning Democrats on Wednesday morning that any attempt to investigate him would be met with retaliation.\n\n\"If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level,\" the president wrote on Twitter, providing no evidence that such leaks occurred. \"Two can play that game!\"\n\nHe followed up with that theme during a Wednesday afternoon press conference, where he told reporters that he would refuse to entertain bipartisan legislative efforts if Democrats pursue investigations of him and his administration.\n\nBut the reality is, the political environment that Democrats faced the day after they surged back into power on Election Day could be dramatically different when the next Congress begins just days after the new year.\n\nFor example, Mueller may be readying to release elements of his findings about whether Trump associates conspired with Russians to influence the 2016 election. House Republicans may use the next few weeks before they hand over their gavels to force more testimony about whether possible anti-Trump bias in the FBI drove its decision to pursue the Russia collusion allegations in 2016 \u2014 an effort Democrats say is being used to undermine Mueller and protect Trump. And Trump moved rapidly Wednesday to make dramatic changes to the leadership of the Justice Department, forcing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to step down and replacing him with interim Attorney General Matthew Whitaker , who will take over supervision of the Mueller probe from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, whose stewardship of the investigation Trump has criticized.\n\nAsked about Trump's threat, Pelosi said Democratic investigations would be well organized, focused on uniting the country and based on the House's \"constitutional responsibility for oversight.\"\n\n\"I don't think we'll have any scattershot freelancing on this,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she's going to leave efforts to obtain the president's tax returns up to the various committees who might pursue them.\n\nAppearing early Wednesday morning on MSNBC, incoming House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said his plans to re-open his panel\u2019s shuttered Russia probe depends in no small part on what happens over the next two months during the lame-duck Congress.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what Bob Mueller has been able to do and what Bob Mueller has been able to say either via indictment or via report and that will also guide what we intend to do in our committee,\u201d the California Democrat said.\n\nIn a divided Congress with little hope for bipartisan legislative action, Democrat-led investigations may indeed be the most significant area of activity.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Democrats wants to probe potential conflicts of interest between the president\u2019s business interests and his decisions since moving into the White House in January 2017. They\u2019re also interested in Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen's admissions in an August guilty plea to making hush payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels and Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey.\n\nSchiff\u2019s House Intelligence Committee has a list of about 70 people, organizations and companies who Democrats say the GOP failed to adequately examine. They\u2019re also eyeing allegations of money laundering between the Trump Organization and foreign interests.\n\nOver at the House Oversight Committee, which historically has the largest investigative staff and the broadest investigative portfolio, Democrats have compiled a laundry list of potential inquiries, from the handling of White House security clearances to the use of private email by White House officials to the Trump administration's response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. In late September, the panel\u2019s Democrats tabulated they had made 64 motions for subpoenas from the minority during the Trump era that the GOP denied.\n\nSeveral committees have also signaled they want to see Trump's tax returns for evidence of potential conflicts of interest or thorny financial entanglements.\n\nBrian Smith, a former Bill Clinton White House attorney who handled congressional oversight responsibilities, said that Democrats aren\u2019t sitting around waiting for the formal transfer of power with the new Congress. \u201cI don\u2019t think Democrats are going to waste any time, frankly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting ready.\u201d\n\nTrump has yet to fortify his administration\u2019s staff to deal with a Democratic oversight onslaught. Scores of hires are expected, for example, in the White House counsel\u2019s office once Pat Cipollone has finished his background security check and gets on the job full-time.\n\nStill, the president and his advisers have already signaled plans to fight the Democratic committees on nearly every front, setting up potentially lengthy fights on accessing documents the committees may need to conduct their oversight. Attempts to issue subpoenas for those documents will likely wind up getting resolved in court.\n\n\u201cIf they want war, believe me they\u2019ll have no trouble getting war from this guy,\u201d said Joe diGenova, an informal Trump adviser who nearly joined the president\u2019s personal legal team earlier this year. \u201cIf they want to issue subpoenas, every single one of them will be litigated all the way to the Supreme Court just in time for the next presidential election.\u201d\n\nThe last time Democrats swept into power \u2014 in 2007 \u2014 it took the incoming House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Henry Waxman a month before he held his first hearing, a look at allegations the George W. Bush administration was suppressing government research into climate change science. Waxman then held a series of hearings framed around waste, fraud and abuse in the Iraq reconstruction efforts, Coast Guard fleets and DHS border security and whether pharmaceutical companies were overcharging for prescription drugs.\n\nMindful of the Waxman example, senior Democratic staffers say they have been thinking through a strategy to stretch out their investigative work over several months, careful not to draw conclusions right away. It's an attempt to counteract Republicans who are already guaranteeing that Democratic overreach will backfire.\n\n\u201cThe whole issue of presidential harassment is interesting. I remember when we tried it in the late 90s. We impeached President Clinton, his numbers went up and ours went down and we underperformed in the next election,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"So the Democrats in the House have to decide just how much presidential harassment is good strategy. I\u2019m not so sure it will work for them.\u201d\n\nRep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), who's vying to become the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, made clear that this would be his line of attack as well.\n\n\"We\u2019re here to remind Mr. Nadler that a House majority doesn\u2019t give liberals license to chase political vendettas at deep cost \u2014 and no benefit,\" he said.\n\nIn an interview before the midterms, Waxman said he\u2019d been having \u201cvery informal\u201d discussions himself with the House Democratic leaders about oversight. He said his message has been: \u201cInvestigations and oversight must be done in a responsible way, otherwise they\u2019re not going to be credible.\u201d\n\nTwo of Waxman\u2019s top former committee staffers \u2014 Phil Barnett and Phil Schiliro, who served also as Obama White House legislative director in the first term \u2014 have also been informally advising their former Democratic colleagues too.\n\nDemocratic aides note that there will be some low-hanging fruit for investigators to pursue quickly.\n\nFor example, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the current ranking Democrat on the Oversight Committee, has already produced documents suggesting a White House role in decisions surrounding a new FBI headquarters. Cummings also launched an inquiry into former national security adviser Michael Flynn's efforts to pursue a nuclear power deal in the Middle East, in part by partnering with Russia. Those well-developed inquiries could be easier to build-upon than to start from scratch.\n\nOne challenge that Cummings will face though is the dramatic increase in his committee's investigative staff. The majority gets a staff of 80 investigators, double the number of those in the minority.\n\nKurt Bardella, a former aide to Rep. Darrell Issa, who chaired the Oversight Committee from 2011 to 2015, noted the strategic significance behind elevating some members to chair subcommittees and take on prominent roles \u2014 they'll be helming high-profile investigations with political consequences and need to be able to explain their probes on TV and in public hearings.\n\nHe also said it's difficult to boost staff in the given timeframe.\n\n\"It is an incredible lift to hire this many people in such a short window of time,\" said Bardella. \"This was one of the areas that we really underestimated back in 2010 in terms of how much of a time suck it was to interview/hire another 40 people on top of the 40 we already had.\"\n\nBurgess Everett contributed reporting.", "Trump used a press briefing to air his frustration with the media, angrily shooting down questions from CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta and admonishing him for his interactions with White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. | AP Photo/Evan Vucci White House Trump to journalist: I'm not a racist.

Trump flatly denied ever using racist language to Walker before quickly moving on to another question.\n\nBut the question of racism in the Trump White House wouldn't go away as another reporter asked if the president regretted a campaign ad connecting Central American migrants seeking asylum in the United States with an undocumented criminal convicted of killing law enforcement officers in California. The ad has been widely condemned as racist, and major networks including CNN, NBC and Fox News have either declined to air it or stopped airing it.\n\n\"Do I regret it? I'm surprised you asked that question. I do not,\" Trump said of the ad, which he also posted to his Twitter account.\n\nAlthough he has repeatedly denied using racist language, Trump has repeatedly called Sen.

The nickname has been panned by several American Indian organizations as a racist slur, though White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has denied it is offensive.\n\nDuring the briefing, Trump expressed difficulty understanding some reporters who spoke with accents.

Republicans are hopeful they can entice support from some Democrats for that amount, although so far, they've appeared resistant. With the Senate still divided 51-49, McConnell will need to corral at least nine Democrats to support a spending package.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on Wednesday he had little interest in engaging with Trump on the issue after past negotiations with the president on immigration have fallen through.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s a very poor negotiator on those issues.

As far as I know, that preparatory work hasn\u2019t been taking place,\u201d said Phil Levy, senior fellow on the global economy at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.\n\nDuring a post-election news conference on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he would be meeting with Xi at the G-20 but didn\u2019t comment on what would be discussed.\n\nAlthough Trump complains frequently about the size of the U.S. trade deficit with China, the justification for his tariffs lies in an investigation done by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative that accuses China of trade-secret theft as well as policies that require American companies to transfer valuable technology to do business there.\n\nStill, China may be wary of entering into talks with the United States, given the difficulty of reaching a deal that will fully satisfy Trump, Levy said. Several efforts over the past years failed because Trump rejected terms worked out by his senior officials.\n\nIf the two sides do begin talks, the negotiations could be long and ultimately futile.\n\n\"The only way it would happen quickly is we fall off most of our demands,\" Reinsch said. \"I think you could cut a market access deal tomorrow. The Chinese tried that in the spring and it didn't work ... The question is whether the president will buy it the second time, or the third time, around.\"\n\nMany trade experts predict that the current U.S. tariffs will stay in place for a long time, and that Trump could take additional steps to increase the pressure on Beijing.\n\n\"We've been looking for an exit ramp here, but we can't find one,\" Reinsch said. \"What we're asking them to do is significantly restructure their economy in a market direction in ways that will undercut the [Communist] party's control, and they're not going to do that.\"\n\nTo some degree, losing control of the House to the Democrats may give Trump even more freedom on his trade agenda.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump identified trade as one area where he hoped to work with Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to lose companies anymore to other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the time for members of both parties to join together, put partisanship aside and keep the American economic miracle going strong.\u201d\n\nOver the past two years, Republican members of Congress have had some success reining in some of Trump\u2019s more radical trade impulses because of concern about their own reelection.

The union didn\u2019t have a count of how many of those teachers won their races as of Wednesday midday.\n\nFederal candidates who were educators or activists also saw mixed success.\n\nWest Virginia state legislator Richard Ojeda, who became a hero among teachers striking in the state, ran as a Democrat for West Virginia\u2019s 3rd District and lost to Republican Carol Miller.

Sorry about that, Mia.\"\n\nThe president also called out several other Republicans who went down after declining to say clearly that they backed him: Republicans Carlos Curbelo of Florida, Mike Coffman of Colorado, Barbara Comstock of Virginia, Peter Roskam of Illinois, Erik Paulsen of Minnesota, Bob Hugin of New Jersey and John Faso of New York also got called out.\n\nTrump engaged in more direct confrontations with the media, tussling with CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta at the news conference, calling him a \"rude, terrible person\" after he asked during the news conference about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\n\"You are a very rude person,\" Trump told Acosta, who had talked over the president. \"The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible, and the way you treat other people is horrible. You shouldn't treat people that way.\"\n\nAs Acosta attempted to ask follow-up questions, a White House aide attempted to pull the microphone away from him, and a tense situation ensued.\n\n\"I'll tell you what, CNN should be ashamed of itself, having you working for them,\" Trump said to Acosta.\n\nA former White House official said Trump supporters will delight in the clash between Trump and Acosta. \"It was brilliant,\" the former official said.\n\nTrump also accused PBS reporter Yamiche Alcindor of submitting a \u201cracist question\u201d after she asked him whether his recent declaration that he is a \u201cnationalist\u201d might have been welcomed by white nationalists.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019d say that,\u201d he shot back, describing Alcindor\u2019s question as \u201cso insulting.\u201d Trump said the term \u201cnationalist\u201d was simply a distinct way to differentiate himself from \u201cglobalists,\u201d and carried zero racist overtones.\n\nBut the president faced a second question moments later about reports that he used racist language on the set of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d where he allegedly referred to African-American rapper Lil Jon, then a contestant on the show, as \u201cUncle Tom,\u201d in addition to using the n-word.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Lil Jon,\u201d Trump told Yahoo! News\u2019 Hunter Walker, prompting Twitter to light up with old photos of the two men smiling as they posed together at a red carpet premiere.\n\nTrump\u2019s intense performance came after Democrats had flipped 28 House seats \u2014 enough to take back control of the House \u2014 by Wednesday morning, with several victories occurring in districts Trump carried by double digits in 2016. They also defeated incumbent Republican Gov. Scott Walker in Wisconsin and propelled Democrat Gretchen Whitmer to a gubernatorial win in Michigan. Both states played a critical role in delivering the presidency to Trump, but now stand to become major challenges as he plots his path to reelection.\n\nDespite their losses, White House officials said the president was more pleased than disappointed by Tuesday\u2019s outcome, noting that Republicans looked poised to gain between two and five Senate seats. Few incumbent presidents in the last century have expanded their party\u2019s Senate majority in off-year elections -- something Trump joyously highlighted as returns poured in Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cIt went significantly better than we thought it would,\u201d a senior White House official told POLITICO, suggesting Trump\u2019s \u201cimpact in a bunch of these states and Senate races was key.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a long night,\u201d said a person close to Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t bleed out like we could have bled out.\"\n\nIn between race projections Tuesday evening, Trump spent much of his time at a White House election watch party consulting with friends, family, and advisers on how he should approach the new political landscape. The president, whose ideological malleability is no secret to Republicans and mostly welcomed by his base, was running through various deal-cutting scenarios, according to one person in the room.\n\n\u201cHe probably asked 25 people what he should say. The question is always if he listens,\u201d said the former White House staffer.\n\nThose close to Trump say because he relishes gamesmanship and isn\u2019t tethered to a single belief system, he is likely to pursue bipartisan legislative solutions to address issues like illegal immigration, surging pharmaceutical costs, and America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure.\n\nThe question is how long that desire lasts, and whether Democrats are willing to play ball.\n\n\u201cWe saw that during his first two years, the president reached out and offered olive branches on things like immigration and infrastructure -- often to the chagrin of Republican leaders,\u201d said former White House adviser Marc Lotter, who accused Democrats of repeatedly rejecting the president\u2019s offers.\n\n\u201cThe dirty little secret of the House Democratic majority is they weren\u2019t elected by the Democratic base to work with Trump on a bipartisan basis,\" said the former White House official.\n\nConversely, a decent number of Democrats who will join Congress as freshman members in January have spent the past few months casting themselves as centrists who want to inject new leadership into the party\u2019s ranks and avoid gridlock. For example, Democrat Anthony Brindisi, a state assemblyman who began his campaign with an \u201cA\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association, bested incumbent Republican Claudia Tenney in New York\u2019s 22nd congressional district, which Trump carried by 20 percentage points in 2016. Early on in his campaign, Brindisisaid he would not support Pelosi for another term as speaker if he won.\n\nIf Trump is truly eager to reach across the aisle, it\u2019s these kinds of members who would be the likeliest to respond.\n\n\u201cThey had a lot of moderate candidates who won precisely because they opposed Pelosi, and I think a lot of these members are going to have a big say in the Democrats\u2019 agenda,\u201d said a former White House staffer.\n\nAndrew Restuccia contributed to this report.", "President Donald Trump promised that his administration would soon release a report on any interference that took place during the midterms. | AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta Cybersecurity Trump says 'we've done a lot of work' on election security\n\nPresident Donald Trump today promised that his administration took election security seriously and accused the media of ignoring federal agencies\u2019 efforts to protect the voting process from foreign interference.\n\n\u201cUnlike the previous administration, we've done a lot of work on that issue,\u201d Trump told reporters when asked during a wide-ranging White House press conference whether he believed that foreign powers had interfered in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIf you speak with the FBI, speak with the Department of Justice, speak to Homeland Security, we've spent a lot of time\u201d on election security, Trump said.

But Wendy Weiser, director of the Democracy Program at NYU\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice, suggested that last night might have marked the start of a backlash against disenfranchisement. And she said the Florida amendment restoring the franchise for convicted criminals who have finished serving their sentences would be the biggest act of voter empowerment since 1971, when the 26th Amendment lowered the voting age to 18.\n\n\u201cThis is a big night for voting rights,\u201d Weiser said. \u201cIt\u2019s very gratifying to see democracy winning at the ballot box.\u201d\n\nConservatives skeptical of the push for expanded voting and registration did enjoy a few victories yesterday. Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, a Republican who has become the face of the fight over the franchise after a series of high-profile battles with voting rights activists, seems likely to narrowly defeat one of those activists, Stacey Abrams, in a governor\u2019s race that his own office oversaw. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, another Republican who presided over controversial purges of voter rolls, was elected lieutenant governor of his state. And North Carolina and Arkansas approved strict new requirements for voters to bring photo ID to the polls.\n\nBut to the delight of voting rights activists, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Republican who was an architect of President Donald Trump\u2019s ill-fated voter fraud commission and other aggressive efforts to restrict the franchise, lost his race for governor. Democrats who pledged to expand access to the ballot also won secretary of state races in Michigan and Colorado, while civil rights attorney Anita Earl won a pivotal seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court, which could be a death knell for Republican gerrymandering efforts that have run into legal trouble. And by taking control of state legislatures as well as governor\u2019s offices in states like New York and Delaware, Democrats may have paved the way for more expansive voting legislation in the future.\n\nIt happened by referendum last night in Nevada and Michigan, which adopted automatic voter registration for anyone who interacts with state government, and in Maryland, where voters can now register to vote when they show up to vote. Voters approved nonpartisan redistricting commissions in Colorado, Missouri and Michigan, while a similar ballot measure appeared likely to pass in Utah. And then there was the Florida amendment, which is expected to restore the franchise to 10 percent of the state\u2019s eligible voters\u2014and 20 percent of its eligible black voters.\n\nThat could make a big difference in future elections; if those former felons had been eligible to vote yesterday, DeSantis and Scott might well have lost. In Florida, African-Americans are just 14 percent of the voting-age population, but they were 42 percent of the inmates released from prison in 2016, and they tend to vote for Democrats. It\u2019s not a coincidence that Republican politicians have pushed strict ID rules, registration purges, and other voter-fraud crackdowns that have tended to benefit them politically, or that Democrats have taken the other side.\n\nPostelection studies have found virtually no evidence of actual voter fraud, and neither did Trump\u2019s voter fraud commission, despite the president\u2019s public claims about millions of illegal votes in 2016. Still, conservatives argue that election officials need to be vigilant about the integrity of the ballot at a time when early voting is stretching their resources and foreign powers want to hack their machines.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t just be a question of civil rights. It also has to be a question of quality control,\u201d says Logan Churchwell of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a nonprofit that has pushed for tougher election rules. \u201cWhen standards drop, chaos begins.\u201d\n\nBut voting rights advocates say the only real chaos in evidence yesterday was in states like Georgia, where 53,000 voters whose registrations had been suspended through Kemp\u2019s \u201cexact match\u201d rules had to convince poll workers of their identities to cast ballots. One precinct in Gwinnett County had to turn away voters for several hours because nobody brought power cords for its voting machines, an isolated snafu that instantly became national news because of the multiple controversies over Kemp, who had publicly accused Democrats of trying to hack the registration system on Monday without a shred of evidence. And while the vast majority of Georgia\u2019s 2,500 precincts had no problems with ballots or machines, some of them did have three-hour lines, often in predominantly African-American areas, a situation that many activists consider a less blatant form of disenfranchisement.\n\nAs of this morning, Kemp was clinging to a 75,000-vote lead over Abrams, probably enough to win without a runoff, and Democrats were wondering how many of the more than 600,000 names Kemp purged from the state\u2019s registration rolls over the past year were real people who would have showed up to vote.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s turnout still blew away records for a midterm\u2014Abrams got 500,000 more votes than Governor Nathan Deal got in his 2014 victory\u2014and there were similar outcomes in other states with voting controversies. For example, in North Dakota, where ID rules were making it difficult for many Native Americans who lived on reservations without street addresses to vote, the furor helped boost early voting turnout on one reservation more than 400 percent over 2014 numbers. Still, electoral victories are determined just as much by who doesn\u2019t vote as by who does, and studies have shown that ID rules and other restrictions on voting do tend to depress turnout, especially in low-income and minority communities. Voting rights activists argue that election rules should aim to maximize turnout by making registration automatic and voting simple, instead of focusing on minimizing voter fraud that rarely seems to happen.\n\nAfter yesterday\u2019s results, 13 states and the District of Columbia now offer same-day registration at the polls, which not only makes it easier to cast ballots but also insulates voters against the kind of registration purges Kemp, Kobach and Husted launched in their states. Now that the Florida amendment passed with 64 percent of the vote, Iowa and Kentucky are the only states that permanently disenfranchise convicted felons. And while it didn\u2019t get much attention on a night when Democrats took back the House, the commissions designed to redraw gerrymandered districts created by Republican legislatures in Colorado, Missouri and Michigan should give more voters a say in choosing their representatives, as opposed to representatives choosing their voters. One reason Democrats were able to flip several congressional seats in Pennsylvania was that courts had ordered the kind of redistricting that will now happen in those states.\n\nDemocratic leaders in the House have vowed to make voting reform a top priority\u2014and 107 Democratic challengers for House seats signed a letter to those leaders calling to make those reforms their first order of business in 2019, including \u201cending the imbalanced and divisive practice of political gerrymandering\u201d and \u201cremoving, once and for all, the deliberate and partisan barriers that prohibit millions of Americans from freely and fairly exercising their right to vote.\u201d Many of those challengers were elected last night, including Elisa Slotkin in Michigan, Jason Crow in Colorado, Antonio Delgado in New York, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, Colin Allred in Texas, Sharice Davids in Kansas and Dean Phillips in Minnesota.\n\nBut Trump is still president, and Republicans expanded their margins in the Senate, so voting reform is unlikely to happen in Washington. There will probably be much more action at the state level, where newly elected Democratic secretaries of state like Jena Griswold of Colorado, a voting rights attorney who attacked the Republican incumbent for cooperating with Trump\u2019s voter fraud commission, have put more emphasis on making sure everyone gets to vote than making sure every vote is thoroughly documented. And the success of anti-gerrymandering measures last night in Missouri, even while it was unseating a Democratic senator, and perhaps even Utah, where a referendum establishing an independent redistricting commission had an 0.6 percent lead as of this morning, suggests that even in red states, voters want voting to be more accessible and meaningful. In 2016, Alaska\u2019s voters approved automatic voter registration even while coming out big for Trump.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this all over the country,\u201d said Weiser, a longtime leader in the voting rights movement. \u201cIt\u2019s going to create a lot of pressure for reform.\u201d\n\nMichael Grunwald is a senior staff writer for Politico Magazine.", "Getty Images Congress What Can Nancy Pelosi Do Now? Expect House Democrats to pursue a singular goal: laying the groundwork to oust Trump in 2020.\n\nDemocrats more or less met expectations on Tuesday, taking clear control of the House of Representatives by a large margin (as well as winning a number of governorships and other state offices), even as they lost Senate seats due in large part to a brutal map. Clearly, a backlash against Trump and Trumpism in the GOP was at least partly responsible for Democrats\u2019 successes.\n\nSo now what? What can a newly empowered Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic House do to harness that backlash? How, in short, can The Resistance go from the streets and the ballot box to the halls of Congress?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nLet\u2019s get one thing out of the way immediately: It won\u2019t come primarily in the form of passing legislation. Indeed, even the supposedly \u201cunified\u201d Republican government of the past two years has produced almost no legislation of note beyond a large tax cut. The one type of legislation that has moved through the current Congress (mostly) has been appropriations bills (and their uglier cousin, the continuing resolution). In the next Congress, Democratic policies will surely find their way into appropriations bills, although that would be more a continuation of the past two years than a break with it. And while there\u2019s always the remote possibility of a grand bargain over infrastructure, we probably shouldn\u2019t be any more sanguine about the next two years of Infrastructure Week than we\u2019ve been about the past two.\n\nBut when it comes to actually checking a president, legislation is generally a dead end, for the simple reason that presidents can always wield the veto pen, and the supermajorities needed to override a veto (two-thirds in both houses) are nearly impossible to assemble.\n\nBut Congress, as I argued in some detail in a book published last year, has a lot of tools beyond simply legislating, and many of those tools are available to a single house, acting alone. Some of them are even available to individual members. Importantly, these things are largely geared toward making a case for 2020, rather than enacting substantial change right now.\n\nOne important source of power will come via oversight. Democrats will now hold the gavels in all committees in the House, which means they will set committee agendas and control the subpoena. With Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) taking over the Intelligence Committee chair from Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), we can certainly expect the committee to reopen and reinvigorate its investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, with a special focus on whether the Trump campaign colluded or the Trump administration tried to cover it up. With Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) set to take the gavel of the Oversight Committee, we can expect deep dives into everything from how the White House has handled security clearances to alleged venality by various current and former administration officials. And with Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) set to lead the Judiciary Committee, impeachment proceedings\u2014whether against the president or others around him\u2014remain a live possibility.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/2141/1155968404_5858584191001_5858574182001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nAll of these Democratic-led committees will have the power to subpoena people and documents (including, for example, tax returns) in aid of their investigations. (And, indeed, individual members, taking advantage of their immunity under the Constitution\u2019s Speech or Debate Clause, can read any document they want into the public record, subject to discipline meted out only by their own chamber.) House committees will also have the power to report out a contempt resolution (subject to a vote by the full House) if the targets of subpoenas resist complying. If the defiance continues, the House could turn to the courts\u2014where it would face interminable delays and the possibility of at least partial defeat\u2014or, more promisingly, it could turn to other congressional tools, like the power of the purse. A threat to zero out some item that the administration cares about has a way of bringing people to the table.\n\nCrucially, the most important way that all of these mechanisms work is through their publicity. Congressional hearings are, among other things, a form of political theater. Like all theatrical productions, they can be staged well or poorly, and, when done well, they can change their audiences\u2019 minds and move them to action. When the hearings are over some high-stakes issue, they can capture the public\u2019s imagination and lead to real consequences.\n\nThis will be true of oversight hearings, where one of the Democrats\u2019 principal goals will be to damage the public standing of the administration. It will be true even if those confrontational hearings escalate into fights over contempt citations, and it will be true even if those contempt fights spill over into collateral areas like appropriations.\n\nIndeed, this will even be true if matters escalate all the way to impeachment. After all, even if the House Democratic majority impeaches the president, it would take extraordinary revelations to even come close to garnering the two-thirds Senate supermajority to convict and remove him. But that won\u2019t be the point.\n\nThe point will be to make a case to the public about why Democrats should be trusted with additional governing power. A president whose public standing is suffering will find himself less powerful even in the middle of his term (just ask George W. Bush circa 2005), but the real focus will be on the next election. This forward-looking focus may explain why Democratic leaders have been reluctant to support talk of impeachment thus far\u2014and it may also explain how they could come to change that stance, if the political winds shift.\n\nIn short, Democrats will want to make sure that, in retrospect, 2018 looks like 2006 rather than 1994 or 2010. In 2006, in the context of Bush\u2019s sagging popularity, Democrats took both houses of Congress, and they managed to use the next two years to build on that momentum. As a result, the 2008 elections gave them the presidency and increased margins in both chambers. By contrast, Republicans squandered their advantage after the 1994 and 2010 elections, with Clinton and Obama reelected in 1996 and 2012, respectively.\n\nSo, how can Democrats continue to press their advantage? There is no magic formula, but what will be essential for Democrats is to keep their eye on the voters that will put them over the edge nationwide in 2020. Many of them will be in suburban areas that have traditionally been Republican strongholds but broke for Democrats in 2018. Winning them over in a presidential election may require counseling a measure of patience to an impatient base\u2014a base that has just turned out in a big way demanding that Trump be vigorously checked right now. But Democrats need to spend the next two years demonstrating that they are a responsible party, one that fights for its goals, rather than simply for the sake of fighting.\n\nThe years after the 1994 Republican Revolution are a good study in what they should not do. In the aftermath of their big win, the GOP led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich pushed for the most extreme version of the policies it had campaigned on, despite evidence showing that the public was receptive only to a more moderate version of the party\u2019s agenda. Gingrich pursued his goals into two government shutdowns, during which he also squandered public good will by appearing petty and self-serving.\n\nThe lesson here is not that Democrats in 2019 should not aggressively confront Trump\u2014even if that confrontation develops into a high-stakes budget fight, or even an impeachment battle. The lesson, rather, is that Democrats should keep their eyes on the prize: maintaining the level of public trust and support that led to Tuesday\u2019s win, which may allow them to push for small policy victories over the next two years, and, more importantly, will provide the record on which they will run at the end of that period.\n\nThis means that Democrats will have to resist the Gingrich-like urge to be maximally combative, and instead be judiciously combative. They need to lay the groundwork for their fights. Yes, the base already believes that Trump should be impeached. But starting there is likely to alienate those outside of their base, and bases alone don\u2019t win elections. They should begin with exhaustive public hearings aimed at oversight, making public documents that they think the public might want to see, and forcing the administration to escalate the conflict if it wants to keep those documents secret.\n\nThey should demonstrate a willingness to compromise on reasonable conditions, but not on the ultimate objective of effective\u2014and public\u2014oversight. If they can convince the public that they are the reasonable ones in this conflict, then heightening the tension will only serve to harm the administration further.\n\nIf they are patient and strategic, and let success build on public success, then Tuesday may prove to be just the first of many victories.\n\nJosh Chafetz (@joshchafetz) is professor of law at Cornell Law School and the author, most recently, of Congress\u2019s Constitution: Legislative Authority and the Separation of Powers.", "Former President Barack Obama also praised voters for crushing trends with soaring turnouts. 36 million people cast their votes in early voting alone, compared to 27.2 million in 2014. | AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin Elections Obama on Democratic wins: 'It is a start'\n\nFormer President Barack Obama praised Democratic midterm efforts in a Twitter post Wednesday morning, pointing to strong Democratic performances in previously solidly Republican areas.\n\nIn a statement posted on his Twitter feed, Obama celebrated the diversity of candidates who ran across the country, including alumni of his own administration.

Women led the way, making up a majority of those who flipped seats. People of color won notable victories in predominantly white House districts that had favored Donald Trump. And yet there were glaring weak spots: no House pickups in the critical swing states of Ohio and North Carolina, and only two in Florida, in its bluest parts.\n\nDemocrats didn\u2019t win with the pet strategies many progressives have insisted Democrats must adopt to retake the presidency in 2020. They didn\u2019t run on Medicare for all. They didn\u2019t respond in kind to Trump\u2019s waging of culture war. By and large, they ran as upbeat bipartisan problem-solvers who would improve upon the Affordable Care Act, while painting their Republican opponents as tools for corporate special interests. Where that mix of \u201cPopulism Lite\u201d and pragmatism worked best to poach Republican seats on Trump turf was largely in the Midwest and the Rust Belt.\n\nIn other words, the midterms strongly suggest Democrats should find a nominee who can serve America a steaming pot of Midwestern Nice.\n\nHowever, Democrats are not well positioned to replicate that model in 2020, because their Midwest bench is not deep. Most of the Democrats expected to jump into the 2020 presidential race hail from the bluest parts of the country, such as Vermont\u2019s Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts\u2019 Elizabeth Warren, New York\u2019s Kirsten Gillibrand, New Jersey\u2019s Cory Booker and California\u2019s Kamala Harris. All year, they have been trying to outdo one another in showing off their pugnacity and policy ambition, which is not what worked last night.\n\nDemocrats won last night in a mix of places. Several won in the reddish parts of blue states like Illinois, New York and New Jersey. Some caught Republicans sleeping in quirky, deep-red districts like the urban Oklahoma 5th and the wealthy, coastal South Carolina 1st. But where Democrats struck hardest last night was in the Midwest and Rust Belt states that Trump had narrowly won in 2016.\n\nAided by a court-ordered redrawing of district lines, Democrats gained four House seats in Pennsylvania as Gov. Tom Wolf and Sen. Bob Casey cruised to reelection, raising hopes for Democrats that the state is coming back to the fold. The most politically divided Pennsylvania district in which Democrats triumphed was the 7th. To win there, attorney Susan Wild promised to be a \u201cbipartisan force\u201d and reject \u201cextreme partisanship.\u201d At the same time, she sought to impress the blue-collar workers of Allentown by talking about how her mom took her \u201cto the picket lines \u2026 and taught me about fighting for workers\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\nIn Wisconsin and Michigan, Democrats wrested away Republican governorships thanks to Tony Evers and Gretchen Whitmer, candidates known more for their pleasant demeanor than partisan fire. And even though Randy Bryce flamed out in Wisconsin, two women with a more pragmatic approach picked off suburban House districts in Michigan that voted for Trump. Elissa Slotkin introduced herself to Michigan\u2019s 8th as a national security aide with a bipartisan pedigree, having worked for Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, but who also believes that \u201ccorporate money\u201d is \u201cpoisoning Washington.\u201d Haley Stevens, in the 11th District, leaned heavily on her work for the Obama administration on the \u201cauto rescue\u201d to appeal to Michigan\u2019s can-do spirit and present herself as a strong voice for manufacturing and infrastructure.\n\nDemocrats also snagged two Republican-hold House seats in Iowa, a state that swung hard from Obama to Trump. While Democrats came up short in the gubernatorial contest there, they won the majority of the statewide House vote, suggesting that the entire state may be primed to swing back two years hence.\n\nIowa\u2019s 1st District might be the most working-class district won by the Democrats in the nation, with slightly more than a quarter of its residents holding a college degree. Twenty-nine year old Abby Finkenauer regularly tagged incumbent Republican Rep. Rod Blum as a creature of Washington, and she put a populist twist on criticizing Trump\u2019s trade war, arguing that the tariffs are hurting Iowa farmers. But she was careful not to attack Trump by name, assuring swing voters, \u201cI\u2019ll work with anyone if it helps Iowa, but I\u2019ll have the backbone to stand up to anyone who hurts us.\u201d\n\nDemocrat Cindy Axne edged out Republican Rep. David Young in Iowa\u2019s 3rd by selling herself as an \u201cefficiency expert\u201d who \u201csaved taxpayer money\u201d while working for state government, and who understands that \u201cfamilies are taxed too much.\u201d When attack ads sought to paint her as close to Nancy Pelosi, she aired a response insisting she would be an \u201cindependent voice.\u201d\n\nA short trip down the Missouri River from Iowa\u2019s 3rd finds another key Midwest pickup, Kansas\u2019 3rd, won by Sharice Davids, a district that shifted from solidly supporting Mitt Romney 2012 to just barely favoring Hillary Clinton in 2016. When Davids ran in the Democratic primary against a Bernie Sanders-backed populist, she highlighted her gender, her sexual orientation, her Native American ancestry and her mixed-martial arts skills. And she flirted with single-payer health insurance and abolishing ICE. For the general, she distanced herself from those positions, offering a more buttoned-down image not centered on identity and, like many other successful female Democratic candidates, delivering a message of bipartisanship: \u201cI'll work with anyone to lower health care costs and improve our schools.\u201d\n\nAll of these women helped the Democrats reclaim the House majority not only by signaling their interest in problem-solving, but also by steering clear of culture-war skirmishes. Similarly, candidates of color who performed best in predominantly white districts that Trump won did not follow Gillum\u2019s confrontational playbook when faced with racist attacks. Instead they employed finesse.\n\nIn New York\u2019s 19th District, Hispanic-African-American Antonio Delgado overcame a barrage of ads caricaturing him as a \u201crapper\u201d with \u201cNew York City values\u201d who doesn\u2019t share \u201cour values.\u201d He indirectly responded with his own series of ads, featuring white constituents testifying that Delgado \u201cgets us\u201d and does share \u201cour values.\u201d\n\nDelgado, of course, is a East Coast example. But 31-year-old African-American Lauren Underwood pulled off a Midwest surprise in Illinois\u2019 14th. She shrugged off a Republican attack ad that darkened her skin, and stayed focused on health care. In her closing ad, against images of white farmers and workers, she delivering a unifying message that \u201cour community\u201d was being hurt by the Republican incumbent\u2019s vote against the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNone of these candidates were viral video stars. None of these candidates pushed the envelope on policy. And none were obsessed with Trump. What they did right was root themselves in their communities, communicate a shared sense of values and signal a willingness to make Washington work again. Are there any Midwest Democrats who might run for president and follow that example?\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a low-key pragmatist who easily won reelection last night, seemed destined to be on a vice presidential shortlist. But if pragmatic Midwestern women were good for Democrats in 2018, then they might be even better as the ticket-topper in 2020. Klobuchar deserves a fresh look as a presidential candidate. Other Midwestern senators who won reelection last night\u2014Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters of Michigan, and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin\u2014would warrant consideration, too, but unlike Klobuchar, nonehas made moves to suggest a presidential run.\n\nRep. Tim Ryan, who represents Ohio\u2019s blue-collar Mahoning Valley, has been publicly musing about a run. An even bigger long shot would be South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Going beyond the boundaries of the Midwest, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and outgoing Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper could certainly run as cheerful, bipartisan-minded problem-solvers. And of course, former Vice President Joe Biden is more than happy to remind you of his Rust Belt, Scranton, Pa., roots.\n\nWith the exception of Biden, all of these potential candidates may struggle to get a toehold in a Democratic presidential primary. The pool of voters they must appeal to are the truest of the true blue. These are the people who respond to viral video campaign ads, who flood progressive celebrities with small-donor cash, and travel across state lines to knock on doors for them. The presidential field will be enormous, as will the resulting pressure to engage in wild antics to grab the attention of 2020 primary voters and break out of the pack. This would not fit the image of the slow and steady Midwestern pragmatist.\n\nDemocratic primary voters typically want to be dazzled, on policy and persona. But the candidates who won on Tuesday, in the states and districts that matter most, weren\u2019t dazzlers. The best Democratic prospects for 2020 may end up getting lost in the noise.\n\nBill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine, and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show \u201cThe DMZ.\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: Elections\n\nAmy Klobuchar\n\n2020", "President Donald Trump in recent weeks has been relatively restrained in attacking Robert Mueller, as the special counsel went quiet in the lead-up to the midterms. | AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster White House Trump revives his attacks on Mueller\n\nPresident Donald Trump renewed his attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller and his Russia probe on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after Democrats won control of the House.\n\n\"According to NBC News, Voters Nationwide Disapprove of the so-called Mueller Investigation (46%) more than they Approve (41%),\" Trump wrote on Twitter, although NBC News' exit poll actually shows 42 percent of voters nationwide approve of Mueller's handling of the probe, while 45 percent disapprove.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"You mean they are finally beginning to understand what a disgusting Witch Hunt, led by 17 Angry Democrats, is all about!\" Trump continued.\n\nDemocrats won back the House following Tuesday's midterms, which primes those lawmakers with subpoena power to fight the White House if it tries to block a public release of Mueller's probe on whether Russia colluded with Trump's 2016 campaign.

He\u2019s vowed to use \u201clegal means\u201d if necessary to overcome resistance from Republican legislators, who said they would oppose any effort to expand the program.\n\n\u201cWe have to get those resources, and we\u2019re going to get it,\u201d Evers told reporters at a campaign really in October. \u201cBut I do think we can work together.\u201d\n\nIn Maine, Democrat Janet Mills\u2019 victory over an anti-Obamacare Republican will end Gov. Paul LePage\u2019s blockade of the program. LePage, the term-limited tea party firebrand, vetoed numerous expansion bills in recent years and is still fighting in court a 2017 ballot initiative ordering the state to expand Medicaid.\n\nThe Maine ballot measure, which was the first of its kind, helped inspire similar efforts among frustrated advocates in other Republican-controlled holdout states. Idaho, Nebraska and Utah voters easily approved Medicaid expansion on Tuesday night, but it remains to be seen whether Republican officials in those states will stand in the way.\n\nTo implement Medicaid expansion, lawmakers in Nebraska and Idaho will have to address how to finance their states' share of the program's costs. States cover a small but gradually increasing portion of costs, which eventually settle at 10 percent. Utah's ballot measure included a small boost in the state's sales tax to help pay for Medicaid expansion.\n\nStates with large numbers of uninsured adults are likely to remain expansion holdouts after Republicans retained control of governorships. A narrow GOP victory in Florida and a likely win in Georgia will prevent more than 1 million from gaining Medicaid coverage. In Texas, the nexus of anti-Obamacare fervor, about 1.2 million poor adults aren\u2019t eligible for expanded Medicaid because of Republican opposition.\n\nIn Montana, which expanded Medicaid in 2015, voters apparently rejected a ballot measure that would have permanently funded the program beyond its June 2019 sunset date. Republican state lawmakers have said they want to continue the program with new work requirements. The ballot results have not been certified as of Wednesday morning.\n\n", "\"I helped build a majority from a deeper hole than this and I have what it takes to do it again,\" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said. \"That is why I have decided to run for Republican Leader and humbly ask for your support.\" | Alex Wong/Getty Images Elections McCarthy launches bid for House minority leader Conservative hard-liner Jim Jordan is challenging him from the right.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy launched a bid for minority leader Wednesday, moving to assert control over the Republican Conference even as GOP lawmakers begin to grapple with losing their majority on Election Day.\n\nMcCarthy already faces a challenge from his right, although the California Republican and his allies believe McCarthy will win this race handily. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), one of the founders of the House Freedom Caucus, has already announced he is running for minority leader.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHouse Majority Whip Steve Scalise has announced he will run for minority whip in the 116th Congress, which would make McCarthy and Scalise the top two Republicans if they're successful, as expected.\n\nThe leadership jockeying comes even before the final tally is made of Tuesday's losses that swept House Republicans out of power in the House after eight years.\n\n\"Today is a difficult day. Our members competed hard across the country. But after months of enduring nonstop biased attacks and unprecedented liberal resources, we came short of defying history and holding the House,\" the 53-year-old McCarthy wrote in a Wednesday letter to other House Republicans. \"Even so, we should not let last night\u2019s results diminish the great gains President Trump and our majority have delivered.\"\n\nMcCarthy added: \"I helped build a majority from a deeper hole than this and I have what it takes to do it again. That is why I have decided to run for Republican Leader and humbly ask for your support.\"\n\nRepeating claims made by President Donald Trump, with whom McCarthy has forged a close relationship, the California Republican argued that \"we have seen where Democrats want to take our country \u2014 open borders, government-run health care, impeaching President Trump, and crushing debt for our kids and grandkids. We simply cannot let that happen.\"\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Ryan and McCarthy \u2014 two members of the \"Young Guns,\" the name given to up-and-coming conservative leaders a decade earlier \u2014 forged a close working relationship. McCarthy, though, clearly still wanted to be speaker someday.\n\nWith Ryan's surprise retirement announcement in April, McCarthy stepped into the role as the top campaign surrogate for House Republicans. He raised tens of millions of dollars during hundreds of events for GOP candidates and incumbents across the country, a move that will bring him strong support in his bid to become the top House Republican.\n\nJordan had previously indicated he would run for speaker or minority leader, and he doubled down on that promise Wednesday. \"I plan to run for minority leader,\" Jordan said in a Hill.TV interview.\n\nJordan went on to list a number of unfulfilled GOP campaign promises that conservatives say contributed to the party\u2019s loss of power Tuesday night: \"In 2016, the American people elected Republicans to come here and change this town. I think the president is doing just that, but I don't think they see the same intensity from folks in Congress, folks in the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nThe race pits two Trump allies against each other. McCarthy, a pragmatist who has recently rebranded himself as an immigration hard-liner, is close with Trump and speaks with him on a near-daily basis. Trump, however, also fawns over Jordan, a conservative darling and TV star who aggressively defends the president at every turn.\n\nWith Democrats vowing to aggressively investigate Trump and the administration, Jordan's allies argue that Trump needs an attack dog like him fighting on behalf of the White House against what could become an impeachment battle.\n\nBut Jordan, 54, is deeply unpopular with some of his colleagues. His no-holds-barred tactics and insistence on GOP ideological purity have rankled lawmakers who've sought to work across the different factions or across the aisle.\n\nJordan also infuriated several rank-and-file members when he declared for speaker a few months the election. These members felt he should be focused on helping his colleagues win reelection, though Jordan has raised millions and donated to dozens of candidates in his effort to elect conservatives.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan's hard-line pitch for minority leader may not sit well with GOP lawmakers who feel they lost the House in part because of the Freedom Caucus\u2019 demand to repeal Obamacare in 2017. | Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nWhile the Freedom Caucus is expected to make up a larger portion of the House GOP next year, McCarthy needs only half the conference to be minority leader and is expected to easily secure those votes. McCarthy has privately been button-holing lawmakers for weeks about supporting him to replace Ryan, but he had not yet gone public with his intentions until Wednesday.\n\nJordan\u2019s hard-line pitch may not sit well with lawmakers who feel they lost the House in part because of the Freedom Caucus\u2019 demand for a conservative Obamacare repeal bill in 2017. Jordan in his interview Wednesday morning, cited the fact that Republicans had not yet repealed Obamacare as a reason to elevate him atop the caucus.\n\nBut many House Republicans lost their seats Tuesday night specifically because of their vote for the repeal measure. Back then, the Freedom Caucus insisted that the bill allow states to opt out of requirements that insurance companies charge healthy and sick people the same. Democrats seized on that vote, accusing Republicans of trying to gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions, the most popular element of Obamacare.\n\nJordan\u2019s endgame, however, may not really be minority leader.\n\nHe has sought for years to lead the House Oversight Committee and has also eyed the ranking Republican position on the House Judiciary Committee, conservative sources have said. By trying to deny McCarthy the votes for minority leader, Jordan can leverage his position to get what he wants or empower other conservatives.\n\nWhile Jordan is unlikely to beat McCarthy, the race for GOP Conference chair quick heated up Wednesday morning. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, former Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s daughter, is challenging Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers for the position. The Washington state Republican has held the job for years. And while many Republicans privately discussed challenging her, few did because of the optics of taking on the sole woman in a male-dominated GOP caucus.\n\nCheney doesn\u2019t have that issue. The battle is expected to be fierce, with some members calling for change atop leadership and Cheney, a defense hawk, promising to more effectively communicate GOP accomplishments to the public \u2014 the key role of the No. 3 position.\n\nStill, McMorris Rodgers has her allies. And it\u2018s unclear whether Cheney's challenge would fuel any backlash should members react angrily over her challenge.\n\nIf Cheney is worried about that, she hasn\u2019t shown it. In a letter to GOP colleagues sent Wednesday morning, Cheney suggested that Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic takeover was proof that \u201cour message isn\u2019t breaking through\u201d \u2014 and jabbed at McMorris Rodgers specifically. She said the 115th Congress was one of the \u201cmost productive in history\u201d considering the GOP\u2019s tax cuts as well as a big defense spending boost.\n\n\u201cLast night did not turn out as we had hoped,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFor us to prevail in this new environment, we must fundamentally overhaul and modernize our House GOP communications operation. We need to be able to drive our message across all platforms. We need to own the daily news cycles.\u201d\n\nOutgoing Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker, meanwhile, started laying the groundwork to succeed Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) as vice conference chair. The North Carolina Republican, who just won a third term, has served as a bridge of sorts between GOP leadership and conservatives in the House, taking stands when he feels it\u2018s necessary but also working with both to get legislation passed.\n\nWalker has also discussed the need for more effective communication by House Republicans. He is currently running unopposed.\n\n\u201cIn the minority, Republicans need to improve their rapid response efforts and learn to fight in unfamiliar territory,\u201c Walker said in a statement to POLITICO. \u201cWe have to be relentless in taking our message to voters, especially to new audiences and new generations.\u201c", "Sen. Bill Nelson released a statement Wednesday morning announcing that he was disappointed in the election night results. | Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images Elections Nelson, Scott race headed to recount\n\nThe razor-thin Florida Senate race between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and the state\u2019s Republican Gov. Rick Scott is headed to a recount, Nelson\u2019s campaign announced Wednesday morning.\n\nWith more than 8 million votes cast, the two candidates are separated by fewer than 35,000 votes, with Scott holding the slim lead. Nelson\u2019s campaign sent out a statement at 1 a.m. saying it was \u201cnot the result Senator Nelson and his campaign had worked so hard for,\u201d but that the statement was \"not a concession.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn a followup statement at 10 a.m. Wednesday, Nelson\u2019s campaign announced that overnight the lead shrunk to a 0.4 percent lead for Scott, which is within the one-half percent margin to trigger a recount under state law.\n\nFlorida is not new to the election recount national spotlight. In 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court had decide the outcome in Florida in that year\u2019s presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Ultimately the court settled in favor of Bush, who went on to win the state by 537 votes and serve two terms as president.\n\nScott spokesman Chris Hartline hammered the move.\n\n\u201cThis race is over. It\u2019s a sad way for Bill Nelson to end his career,\u201d Hartline said in an email. \u201cHe is desperately trying to hold onto something that no longer exists.\u201d\n\nFlorida\u2019s 67 counties now must recheck their tallies, a process they initially have until noon on Nov. 10 to complete. In addition, Nelson\u2019s campaign is sending monitors to every county across the state. The campaign is already working with well-known Democratic attorney Marc Elias with the firm Perkins Coie.\n\nIn the statement, Elias hinted at some areas of the state that will get the campaign\u2019s focus. He noted a Tampa Bay Times story where Madison County\u2019s GOP Supervisor of Election Thomas Hardee, a Scott appointee, was quoted saying he wanted to meet with Nelson to \u201ceat his lunch\u201d over claims Nelson made that Russians had been interfering in Florida\u2019s 2018 midterm elections.\n\n\u201cI was trying to give him as much of a fit as I could,\u201d Hardee told the newspaper.\n\nElias singled that comment out and said they would be watching supervisors across the state.\n\n\"We expect the supervisors, regardless of their party affiliation, will discharge their constitutional duties,\" Elias said.\n\n", "Pre-election fears by some Republicans that President Donald Trump\u2019s inflammatory immigration message would sink GOP candidates in tight races proved overblown. | Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images elections Trump\u2019s immigration push may have stemmed GOP losses\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s intense focus on immigration in the run-up to the midterms appears to have stemmed GOP losses in Tuesday\u2019s election, according to a POLITICO analysis of 34 close House, Senate and gubernatorial races.\n\nDemocrats took control of the House, as predicted, but Republicans were on track to expand their majority in the Senate.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPre-election fears by some Republicans that Trump\u2019s inflammatory immigration message would sink GOP candidates in tight races proved overblown.

Of these, Democrats won 15 contests and Republicans won 12 contests. But Republicans led in six out of seven races that hadn\u2019t been called by Wednesday afternoon.\n\nIn making immigration a major theme in the lead-up to the election, Trump succeeded at the very least in persuading voters it was a top issue, to judge from exit polls. For weeks, the president warned darkly that a caravan of Central American migrants traveling north through Mexico en route to the United States represented an \u201cinvasion\u201d and \u201cnational emergency.\u201d\n\nIn response, he deployed 5,200 troops to the southwest border \u2014 and threatened to increase the number to 15,000. The White House also floated a mix of measures to deter families arriving at the border, including a reprise of the president\u2019s widely criticized family separation policy. In a surprise move, Trump further suggested last week that he could issue an executive order to roll back birthright citizenship, an action most legal experts argue would run afoul of the Constitution.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who won reelection Tuesday by a relatively narrow margin over Democratic Rep.Beto O'Rourke, may have benefited the most from Trump\u2019s immigration offensive.\n\nTrump visited Houston to rally for Cruz in late October. While there, he tarred O\u2019Rourke as a \u201ca radical open-borders left-winger\u201d and accused Democrats of \u201cencouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders and overwhelm our nation.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, the president surged troops to the border just days before the election \u2014 what some critics viewed as an expensive wager that immigration could increase Republican turnout.\n\nFollowing the deployment, Cruz took the opportunity to lambaste his opponent as soft on security. \u201cHe is waiting on the Rio Grande with welcome baskets and foot massages,\u201d the incumbent senator said of O\u2019Rourke.\n\n\u201cI think the message resonated with a lot of people,\u201d said Singleton. \u201cSome folks will call it fear. I think it was more about order, I think it was more about law.\u201d\n\nBut other Republicans who embraced Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration views went down Tuesday.\n\nIn Virginia, Brat fell to Democratic challenger Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA agent. In 2014, the Tea Party-backed Brat defeated then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a primary challenge in part by attacking him for supporting \u201camnesty\u201d for undocumented immigrants.\n\nTodd Schulte, president of the Mark Zuckerberg-backed FWD.us, considered the outcome one of several that amounted to a rejection of Trump\u2019s contentious immigration policies. In a written statement, Schulte called the election \u201ca stunning rebuke for the leaders of the hard-line, anti-immigrant movement, with their champions losing badly.\u201d\n\nA more diverse electorate in certain House districts appears to have weakened the effectiveness of Republican attack ads on immigration, according to New American Economy, an organization backed by Michael Bloomberg. The group found that all 27 of the districts that Democrats have wrested from Republicans in vote tallies thus far experienced a proportional increase in Hispanic and Asian American voters between 2016 and 2018.\n\nKobach, Kansas' secretary of state, fell in a three-way race for governor of that state. Kobach had advised Trump\u2019s presidential campaign on immigration issues and played a lead role in the administration\u2019s now-defunct commission to root out alleged voter fraud, which stemmed from the president\u2019s baseless allegation that millions of undocumented immigrants had voted in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cHe has a long history of vilifying immigrants and pushing repressive policies. He has inflicted pain on millions. It finally caught up with him,\u201d said Frank Sharry, executive director of the pro-immigrant America\u2019s Voice, in an election-night statement.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Republican Rep. Lou Barletta \u2014 a long-shot challenger with Trump\u2019s backing \u2014 failed to unseat Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. As mayor of Hazleton, Pa., from 2000 to 2010, Barletta blasted an influx of undocumented immigrants and backed a local ordinance that made it illegal to rent housing to undocumented immigrants. (A federal appeals court found the ordinance unconstitutional in 2010.)\n\nRep. Steve King (R-Iowa) \u2014 an immigration hard-liner known for offensive, racially charged comments \u2014 struggled in an unusually close contest. Just days before the election, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Rep. Steve Stivers of Ohio called out King in an effort to \u201cstand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms.\u201d\n\nKing is projected to win his Iowa district by roughly 3 percent, a tiny margin in a reliably Republican area. Trump won the district by 27 percent in 2016.\n\nDemocratic pollster Jeff Liszt, partner at the firm ALG Research, said Trump\u2019s focus on immigration before the elections reflected an attempt to retain the Republican grip on the Senate while \u201c[lighting] the House majority on fire by ignoring the swing voters who are going to be turned off.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday night, Democrats captured seats in suburban districts where GOP candidates suffered from an association with Trump. Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), who sponsored a 2017 bill that targeted alleged immigrant gang members, lost to Democrat Jennifer Wexton, a state senator. Other GOP lawmakers in districts that Hillary Clinton won in 2016 went down, too, including Reps. Carlos Curbelo of Florida, Kevin Yoder of Kansas and Mike Coffman of Colorado.\n\nSeveral Democrats running for Senate in states Trump won in 2016 struggled even after adopting a tougher tone on immigration \u2014 an indication that Trump moved the immigration conversation rightward by harping on the migrant caravan.\n\nRep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) trailed Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) on Wednesday morning in the race to fill the Senate seat held by retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. The contest remained too close to call.\n\nSinema transformed herself from a liberal lawmaker to a centrist Democrat in recent years \u2014 and immigration hasn\u2019t been an exception. When Trump announced he would deploy 5,200 troops to the border, Sinema backed the move. The deployment \u201cshould be a part of our work to gain situational control over the border,\u201d she told the Arizona Republic.\n\nSen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) notched a victory Wednesday in a competitive race against Republican challenger Matt Rosendale, a Montana state official. The president visited the state four times and pilloried Tester on immigration, but the Montana lawmaker secured a third term in a state Trump won by 20 percentage points in 2016.\n\nDemocratic pollster Celinda Lake argued before the election that Trump\u2019s attempt to stoke fears around immigration gave a short-lived jolt to Rosendale, but wasn\u2019t enough to propel him to victory.\n\n\u201cThey certainly closed the race and tightened the race, but in the end, they couldn\u2019t hold it,\u201d Lake said on a call with reporters. \u201cThey caused just as much backlash in some of the small towns and suburban areas as they did picking up votes.\u201d\n\nOther Senate Democrats, such as Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana and, to a lesser extent, Missouri's Claire McCaskill, embraced a tougher tone on immigration, but lost on Tuesday evening.\n\nThis report has been updated with election results and additional reporting.", "Here come the Democrats\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This edition of Morning Tax is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Tax subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pro\u2019s comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy tools and services, click here.\n\nHERE COME THE DEMOCRATS: As expected, Democrats won control of the House, bringing an end to eight years of Republican rule.

Peter Roskam, the panel\u2019s No. 5 Republican and a vocal supporter of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, lost his bid for a seventh term. Rep. Erik Paulsen, who is Chairman Kevin Brady\u2019s roommate in Washington, was defeated too. So were moderate Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who had proposed a carbon tax, and Rep. Mike Bishop. Those losses, combined with a number of previously announced departures from the panel, will leave Republicans with a slew of committee slots to fill next year.\n\nReps. Mike Kelly (R-Pa), Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.), Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.) and George Holding (R-N.C.) all staved off defeat in difficult reelection races.\n\nChange is coming to the Senate Finance Committee as well, where Sens.

Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) won another term despite a tough challenge.\n\nTHE BALLOT INITIATIVES: Conservatives scored a big victory in Florida, where voters overwhelmingly approved a proposal to make it a lot harder for state legislators there to raise taxes, by requiring them to be approved with a two-thirds supermajority. North Carolina, meanwhile, adopted a proposal to reduce the maximum income tax rate to 7 percent. A proposal in Maine to raise payroll taxes to finance a home health care program looked headed for defeat.

Your host previewed that leadership race in the buildup to the election.\n\n\u2014 Senate Commerce ranking member Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) appears to be defeated after three years in the position, meaning that both parties are expected to have new leaders on the committee (The Associated Press has not yet called his race). Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) is expected to step into the chairmanship as John Thune (R-S.D.) looks to make the leap to whip. More on Wicker from our Brianna Gurciullo here. For Democrats, it\u2019s less clear: Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) is next in line in seniority after Nelson, but she is also ranking member of the Energy Committee. If she decided to forego the Commerce top spot, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) would be next in line.\n\nSo-so results for state transpo questions: It was a mixed bag for gas tax and other transportation-related ballot initiatives around the country. California rejected a repeal of a 2017 gas tax increase, Maine authorized more than $100 million in transportation infrastructure bonds, and Connecticut voters agreed to an amendment mandating that transportation revenues be used for transportation projects. But a Missouri gas tax increase failed, and in Colorado, two separate ballot questions aimed at funding transportation projects were shot down.\n\nIT\u2019S THE DAY AFTER: Thanks for tuning in to POLITICO\u2019s Morning Transportation, your daily tipsheet on all things trains, planes, automobiles and ports.

Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the likely next chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement to MT that one of his top priorities would be overhauling TSA in three areas: security operations, personnel management and transparency. \u201cCongress must demand sustained accountability to ensure that TSA officials finally implement unfulfilled security recommendations that sometimes languish for years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also must ensure that TSA officials are protecting whistleblowers, and we need to increase transparency over settlements with employees who report security vulnerabilities.\u201d Cummings has worked with Republicans over the past three years on an investigation of TSA employee misconduct and retaliations against whistleblowers and \u201cit is now time to convert our oversight findings into concrete reforms,\u201d he said.\n\nOutside of TSA: Cummings also said he wanted to continue probing activities at the Coast Guard Academy, including how the service is handling complaints of harassment and retaliation there, and if it is eliminating disparities for minority students.

That process has improved since a 2012 report, but is still \u201chindered by limitations in its contract with the vendor conducting background checks,\u201d according to the watchdog. More than half of background checks were forwarded back to Amtrak by the vendor in fiscal 2017 because there were discrepancies in employment or education histories. Amtrak has also struggled to apply its own background check policies to companies supplying contractors.

The election outcome spoke little to the impact of the president\u2019s trade policies on voter decisions. And does a divided Washington mean that nothing gets done? Don\u2019t count on it, especially if Democrats hope to tout a productive agenda ahead of 2020. Start here:\n\nA DEMOCRATIC HOUSE SETS UP A GRAND BARGAIN ON TRADE: Let the dealmaking begin, especially if the Trump administration wants to get a new NAFTA deal through both houses of Congress. If the past is any guide, the White House can look at how a Republican administration struck a deal with congressional Democrats 11 years ago.\n\nOn May 10, 2007, then-President George W. Bush struck a deal with Democrats to set new standards on labor and environment protections in trade pacts. It could be a road map for the Trump administration to find common ground on trade issues.\n\n\u201cMay 10 was a vital breakthrough,\u201d said Rep. Sandy Levin (D-Mich.), who helped author the original agreement. \u201cThe challenge became to take the clear language in May 10, which was a breakthrough, and make it real.\u201d\n\nA grand bargain, but no grand strategy: Trade experts caution against thinking that House Democrats will use the opportunity to develop a cohesive policy for all trade negotiations.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats are not going to make it easy for political reasons, but there\u2019s a path there,\u201d said Bill Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if it has bigger meaning.\u201d\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is looking to hit an almost mythical sweet spot for bipartisan trade cooperation with the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, but labor unions \u2014 a key motivator for securing Democratic votes \u2014 are already asking for more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fighting to say this isn\u2019t over and there are still gains to be had,\u201d said Celeste Drake, trade policy specialist for the AFL-CIO. Read the full story here.\n\nIT\u2019S WEDNESDAY, NOV. 7! Welcome to Morning Trade, where your host sadly missed the journalistic tradition of election night pizza because he was working from home on Tuesday. Got any post-election insights to share? Let me know: abehsudi@politico.com or @abehsudi.\n\nJoin POLITICO on Nov. 14 for special editorial conversations at The Salute to Military Spouses, a half-day summit to raise awareness of the challenges and contributions of these unsung heroes. As the exclusive media partner of the summit, POLITICO journalists will provide firsthand insight and intelligence on timely political and policy issues facing the military and military spouses. Topics include \u201cImproving the financial stability of military families\u201d and \u201cUsing tech to tackle the high unemployment rate of military spouses.\u201d RSVP here.\n\nA REFERENDUM ON TRUMP\u2019S TRADE POLICIES? MAYBE NOT: Trump\u2019s tariffs garnered much media attention over the past months, but Tuesday night\u2019s results made no clear statement on how the electorate views the administration\u2019s trade policies.\n\nA CNN exit poll found that a third of voters say the policy has had no impact and 25 percent say the policy has helped their area\u2019s economy. A remaining 30 percent of voters said Trump\u2019s trade policies have hurt them.\n\nBut even in races in which Trump\u2019s trade policies have had a big effect on the local economy, the issue didn\u2019t seem to drive voting decisions at the polls.\n\nIn North Dakota, farmers stood by Trump: Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer ousted Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, flipping the major agriculture-producing state Trump won by 36 percentage points in 2016. Heitkamp sought to drive a wedge between North Dakotans and Trump on trade and tariffs. Farmers in the state \u2014 a major producer of soybeans and other ag-export goods \u2014 have been struck hard by retaliatory tariffs in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs on U.S. trading partners.\n\nBut the president has remained popular there, and Cramer opted to urge patience with Trump on tariffs. More on Cramer\u2019s win here.\n\nIllinois district as a test for economic policy: Republican Mike Bost won reelection in Illinois\u2019 12th District. As Pro Trade\u2019s Megan Cassella profiled, the race there demonstrated how an economic argument alone may not be enough to prevail among voters.\n\nWHAT A DIVIDED WASHINGTON MEANS FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS: Democrats will have to find policy victories where they can get them, while also avoiding two years of obstruction that could risk alienating swing voters ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nWhite House keeps it real: A senior administration official told POLITICO recently that no one has \u201ca Pollyanna view of the world, that we\u2019re all going to come together and do big things.\u201d But the hope in the West Wing is that Democrats feel \u201cit\u2019s also in their best interests to look functional.\u201d\n\nWhere bipartisan possibility lies: With a divided Congress, the Trump administration is expected to focus on forging an infrastructure deal with the two chambers and potentially work to rein in drug prices \u2014 two areas typically more aligned with liberals. That\u2019s not to say we should expect a major breakthrough on either issue, but there\u2019s hope in both parties for impactful reforms and projects that could get bipartisan support.\n\nWhere Trump will likely go it alone: If Trump can\u2019t get Congress on board, he\u2019s expected to pursue some policy goals via executive orders, especially on immigration and energy. Among the White House\u2019s priorities are exporting more oil and natural gas. Megan, Nancy Cook and Gabby Orr have more here.\n\nCHAMBER LOOKS FOR COMMON GROUND: Shortly after it was clear that Congress would be divided, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce appealed for a constructive path forward.\n\n\u201cDivided government does not \u2014 and cannot \u2014 mean gridlock. We urge each and every leader to find the middle ground on issues including immigration, infrastructure, and trade,\u201d Chamber CEO and President Tom Donohue said in a statement.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for our elected leaders to train their focus on what can be achieved to keep up America\u2019s economic momentum. There is much to do and no time to waste.\u201d\n\nNEAL POISED TO LEAD WAYS AND MEANS: Rep. Richard Neal is expected to take over the powerful House Ways and Means Committee in 2019, giving him strong oversight of Trump\u2019s trade agenda. Neal, the current ranking member of the panel, would replace Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas).\n\nDealmaker reputation: Neal is known for his ability to work across the aisle. That means his chairmanship could bode well for building bipartisan support for congressional approval of USMCA. Ways and Means has influence over other major issues like tax law and Social Security, which could give him leverage over the president.\n\nWhere he stands on USMCA, other FTAs: Neal has called for stronger, more enforceable labor standards and environmental protections in USMCA. But while congressional Democrats have long been critical of U.S. trade policy, Neal has voted in favor of certain free trade agreements. Neal voted against NAFTA, but voted in favor of deals with South Korea and Peru.\n\nSabrina has more on where Neal falls on Trump\u2019s trade agenda here.\n\nA (SLIGHT) HOPE FOR EX-IM BANK: Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) is projected to take over as leader of the Financial Services Committee. In that role, she is expected to push to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank next September.\n\nThe embattled bank, seen by outgoing Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) as an example of crony capitalism, still faces a major hurdle in the Senate, where Republican Sen. Pat Toomey is blocking new appointments to its board. The board has too few members to reach a quorum required to approve loans for transactions of more than $10 million. Read more from Pro Financial Services\u2019 Zach Warmbrodt here.\n\nDE MINIMIS FOOTNOTE CREATES BIG FUSS: For something that is supposedly too trivial or minor to merit consideration, the U.S. \u201cde minimis\u201d threshold for taxes on package shipments is getting a lot of attention.\n\nThe provision waives taxes and duties on incoming packages worth $800 or less. U.S. negotiators failed in the NAFTA renegotiation talks to persuade Canada and Mexico to raise their thresholds to a similarly high level. But they did include a footnote allowing the Trump administration to reduce the U.S. level to match Canada or Mexico\u2019s.\n\nThat prompted the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation, the Internet Association and other groups to urge Lighthizer to drop the footnote. To read more, click here.\n\nGROUPS PRESS FOR DIGITAL TRADE CHAPTER IN NEW DEALS: Another coalition of more than 30 business groups sent Lighthizer a letter urging him to include a digital trade chapter in prospective agreements with the European Union, Japan and United Kingdom. It was the latest sign of uncertainty about exactly what issues the pacts will cover.\n\n\u201cStrong digital trade outcomes in the EU, Japan, and U.K. negotiations will help counter these growing restrictions on U.S. trade and set examples for other countries developing their own digital trade rules,\u201d the Internet Association and other groups said. \u201cThe administration would miss an opportunity with three of our most important trading partners if it omitted digital trade from the negotiations.\u201d\n\nMalmstr\u00f6m, Lighthizer meeting next week: The push comes as Lighthizer is preparing to host European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m a week from today, a senior EU diplomat told our colleagues in Brussels. Lighthizer notified Congress last month of his intention to negotiate a trade agreement with the EU, but the exact scope of the negotiations remains unclear. That\u2019s partly because the United States is pushing to include agriculture in the deal, while the EU is resisting.\n\nINTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT\n\n\u2014 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs had no impact on NAFTA negotiations, CNN reports.\n\n\u2014 The head of Airbus in China warns that a U.S.-China trade conflict will hurt China\u2019s aviation industry, The Financial Times reports.\n\n\u2014 An economist who accurately predicted the U.S.-China trade fights says there will be a resolution reached in 2019, Bloomberg reports.\n\n\u2014 The CEO of a major Canadian auto parts company said Trump\u2019s tariffs are taking a toll, Fortune reports.\n\nTHAT'S ALL FOR MORNING TRADE!

The result likely rules out another GOP-led attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare, and sets House Democrats up to police the Trump administration\u2019s management of health care policy.\n\nWe might also see bipartisan national privacy legislation, which, depending on how it\u2019s handled, might jostle regulation of the health sector. (We discussed the possibility here.)\n\nThe changeover, of course, means a new cast of characters chairing the important committees. In the House, we\u2019re likely to see Rep. Frank Pallone chairing the Energy and Commerce Committee and Rep. Mark Takano (likely) leading the Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee.

In three out of five comparisons on a total of 158,000 X-rays, performance on the outside hospitals\u2019 X-rays was significantly lower than on X-rays from Mount Sinai.\n\n\u201cOur findings should give pause to those considering rapid deployment of artificial intelligence platforms without rigorously assessing their performance in real-world clinical settings,\u201d said senior author Eric Oermann in a news release. \u201cPatient populations and imaging techniques differ significantly across institutions.\u201d\n\nThe findings point to fundamental difficulties in using AI in health care, Parsa Mirhaji, director of clinical research informatics at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, told POLITICO.\n\nAI learns from the particular relationships of data, and not the clinical phenomena they represent, he said. \u201cThat makes it susceptible to variations and heterogeneity in data\u201d resulting from differences in how the data is represented and in the different health systems\u2019 clinical processes.\n\nINSIDE THE HUMPHREY BUILDING\n\nHHS GEARS GRIND ON: Meanwhile, HHS continued to keep active Tuesday. Here are the latest updates:\n\n\u2014 FDA: FDA released a new, open-source app Tuesday intended to help researchers collect real-world data.\n\nThe app, called \"MyStudies,\" is intended to ease the gathering of reliable real-world data, including from EHRs and patients.\n\n\"Our hope is that the collection of more real world data directly from patients, using a secure app, will lead to more efficient product development and assist with safety monitoring,\" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a news release.\n\nThe app was tested in partnership with Kaiser Permanente, which deployed it to interact with pregnant women in a study dealing with sleep patterns and medication use. FDA is now releasing the app as open-source code for researchers to use.\n\nThe agency also released guidance on unique device identifier compliance for Class I and unclassified devices (i.e. the very least risky medical devices out there). Depending on when the device is labeled, manufacturers will have to submit identifiers in September 2020 or 2021.\n\n\u2014 CDC RFI: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is in the middle of a request for information process on the creation of a national testbed to assess how health IT can deliver best evidence to providers while they\u2019re using care.

The idea is for Insulet\u2019s insulin pump to be managed by a Samsung Galaxy smartphone \u2014 a new advance for the field.\n\nSome glucose monitors beam their data to phones, and some hackers have rigged together monitors, pumps and computers to adjust insulin doses automatically. This is a more formal approach to adjusting insulin dosage by mobile device. \u201cIt\u2019s groundbreaking,\u201d Dave Rhew, Samsung Electronics America\u2019s chief medical officer, told Morning eHealth, though the combination hasn\u2019t been approved by the FDA.\n\nRhew said that the collaboration wasn\u2019t delivered through FDA\u2019s pre-certificaton pilot process (which Samsung is part of), but touted the security of the smartphone, its software and the hook-up with Insulet\u2019s device. \u201cWe have to be able to ensure this solution has the highest level of security,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the fruits of the collaboration haven\u2019t fully materialized, Rhew anticipates extending smartphones to help consumers manage more of their health. \u201cAs you think about the possibility of your smartphone being able to do everything with your health care, managing your devices, communicating with your physician, capturing data \u2026 the possibilities are tremendous,\u201d he said, citing wellness data and EHR data as examples.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a single device people can use to manage their lifestyle and manage their medical condition,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Other biz/tech notes: Alphabet\u2019s holding a two-day conference for employees from its various health-related initiatives \u2026 startup Collective Health is adding a board member with experience taking companies public. \u2026 An interesting reaction from a Kaiser Permanente doc on Atul Gawande\u2019s EHR article\n\nUSDA RURAL TELEMEDICINE REPORT: Telehealth advocates often tout the benefits of the technology for rural patients, but those patients may not be as receptive to it as their urban counterparts, a new study from USDA suggests.\n\nAbout 17 percent of rural residents surveyed did health research online, 7 percent did health maintenance activities like checking records or paying bills online and 1.3 percent participated in remote monitoring \u2014 compared to 20 percent, 11 percent, and 2.5 percent in urban areas, respectively.\n\nThe analysis was conducted using the Census Bureau\u2019s 2015 Current Population Survey data, so trends may have changed since then.\n\nWHAT WE'RE CLICKING\n\nDo genes play less of a role in longevity than we thought?\n\nAllscripts plans on making PDMP data available on its EHRs.\n\nCiitizen \u2014 a startup helping patients control their data \u2014 details some of the spurious reasons providers use to restrict access to patient data.", "It's over\n\nWith help from Ted Hesson\n\nEditor's Note: This edition of Free Morning Shift is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Employment & Immigration subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pro's comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy tools and services, click here.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIT\u2019S OVER: The Democrats won the House, but Republicans gained two seats in the Senate in races called so far. Here\u2019s a rundown of labor and employment winners and losers now that the dust has settled:\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), co-chair of the multiemployer pension supercommittee, won reelection easily. He campaigned on retirement security, Social Security and Medicare, and there\u2019s some talk that he may run for president in 2020 (he says he has \u201cno real interest\u201d).\n\nIn Michigan, Democrat Andy Levin followed his father Sander\u2019s footsteps into the House. Levin fils is a former union organizer, AFL-CIO official, and attorney who sat on President Bill Clinton\u2019s labor law reform commission.\n\nRep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.), the marine vet who earlier this year flipped Pennsylvania's 17th District in a nail-biter special election, won reelection easily. Lamb\u2019s platform was heavily focused on union rights, winning him support from the United Steelworkers and the AFL-CIO. He billed himself as the \u201cmost effective ally\u201d for protecting union rights and supporting prevailing wages.\n\nGOOD WEDNESDAY MORNING!

Bobby Scott (D-Va.), ranking member on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, is expected to become chairman. Democrats will likely exercise greater oversight and subpoena power over DOL and the NLRB.\n\nDemocrats have said they will put the \u201cL\u201d word back into the committee\u2019s name, restoring it to the Committee on Education and Labor (which is what it was called before Republicans won a House majority).\n\nRead more on Democratic leaders\u2019 potential labor plans now that they\u2019ve sealed the majority from POLITICO\u2019s Ian Kullgren here.\n\nGOVERNORSHIP ROUNDUP:\n\nUnions are jubilant over the defeat of two of their bitterest enemies: Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Bruce Rauner of Illinois. Walker spearheaded a 2011 law that restricted severely the ability of public employees to bargain collectively, and in 2015 he signed a right-to-work bill into law. Rauner initiated the litigation that led to the Supreme Court\u2019s Janus decision earlier this year, and has tangled nonstop with public employee unions.\n\nWalker lost by just a couple thousand votes to Democrat Tony Evers, the state schools superintendent. Fight for $15 and the Service Employees International Union are taking some credit for Evers\u2019 narrow victory. They say they operated the \u201csingle-largest voter engagement program\u201d in Milwaukee, knocking on 273,659 doors and talking with 37,173 voters in the runup to Tuesday\u2019s midterms. In reaction to Walker\u2019s loss, the AFL-CIO didn\u2019t mince words: \u201cScott Walker was a national disgrace.\u201d\n\nRauner suffered a steeper defeat from Democrat J.B. Pritzker, who scored 54 percent of the vote in Illinois. Pritzker, who is worth around $3.2 billion, will also be the richest elected politician in the country, taking the title from President Donald Trump according to Forbes.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) won by double digits over Republican challenger Scott Wagner with major support from unions. Wolf vowed in October to veto any legislation \u201cthat attacks workers\u2019 rights,\u201d including one that would bar union non-members from making voluntary fair-share contributions to the union through payroll deductions, according to the Billy Penn.\n\nIn Connecticut, it is still too close to call whether organized labor successfully backed Democrat Ned Lamont, a proponent of a $15 hourly minimum wage and paid family and medical leave, against Republican Bob Stefanowski, who opposed raising the minimum wage. Lamont is currently leading with only a few thousand votes.\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nTRUMP\u2019S IMMIGRATION PUSH: President Donald Trump\u2019s intense focus on immigration before the midterms appeared to yield mixed results. Exit polls published by CNN showed 23 percent of voters considered immigration the most important issue facing the country, second only to health care, which 42 percent dubbed the top concern.\n\nNotably, several Republicans closely aligned with Trump\u2019s immigration policies were defeated by Democrats. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach lost a bid to become governor of his state, Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.) fell short in an attempt to win the seat held by Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), and Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) lost a reelection campaign to Democrat (and former CIA agent) Abigail Spanberger. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) \u2014 who drew fire in the days before the election for his associations with white nationalists \u2014 was reelected by a narrow margin. Trump won the district by 27 percent in 2016.\n\nON THE BALLOT:\n\nIn Florida, voters agreed to ban vaping, including the use of electronic cigarettes, in enclosed indoor workplaces.\n\nVoters in both Arkansas and Missouri approved a raise to the state minimum wage. In Arkansas, the hourly minimum will increase to $11 per hour (up from $8.50) by 2021. Missouri will gradually increase the state\u2019s minimum to $12 an hour by 2023 (up from $7.85). After that it will rise automatically with the consumer price index. Government employees, though, are exempt from the wage hike.\n\nVoters gave the Arizona legislature the green light to make cuts to shore up two of the state\u2019s pension plans for correctional officers and elected officials. Benefit increases will now be based on \u201ca cost of living adjustment tied to inflation,\u201d and corrections officers hired on or after July 1, 2018 will be transitioned to a defined contribution system. The move is expected to save taxpayers $275 million.\n\nCalifornia voters agreed to exempt private ambulance employees from California labor laws requiring that hourly employees be given certain rest and meal breaks without being on call. Private ambulance drivers will be paid at their normal rate during breaks and will remain on call so that they are able to more promptly respond to emergencies.\n\nColorado residents voted to remove a provision in the state constitution that permits \u201cinvoluntary servitude\u201d for criminals.\n\nOregon voters rejected Measure 105, which would have repealed the state\u2019s sanctuary law limiting state cooperation in enforcing federal immigration laws.\n\nA measure in Massachusetts that would have limited how many patients could be assigned to nurses in hospitals and certain other health care facilities was quashed by voters Tuesday.\n\nBut, the Commonwealth\u2019s voters overwhelmingly agreed to uphold a law barring discrimination based on gender identity in public places. The law had support from the business community, which feared a potential economic backlash if the protections were rolled back. More on that from the Boston Business Journal here.\n\nSUPREME COURT\n\nAGE DISCRIMINATION: The Supreme Court said Tuesday that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act applies to all state and local government employers, no matter how small. The Age Discrimination and Employment Act defines an employer as any business that employs 20 or more people but says it \u201calso means\u201d any \u201cState or political subdivision of a State.\u201d The case turned on the meaning of the phrase \u201calso means;\u201d the high court concluded it meant the anti-discrimination law applied to state and local government entities that employed fewer than 20 people--in this instance, a fire department in Arizona. The high court\u2019s decision was unanimous, a relative rarity in employment-related cases.\n\nThe ruling gives ADEA broader reach than Title VII, which applies only to government entities with 15 or more employees. That means \u201cscores of litigants alleging age discrimination claims will now have access to federal court,\" according to Randi May, employment law partner at Hoguet Newman Regal & Kenney, LLP. Read the opinion here.\n\nCHINESE WORKERS TO WISCONSIN: At a campaign event last month for Gov. Scott Walker, President Donald Trump touted as the \u201cmost incredible plan\u201d Taiwan-based Foxconn\u2019s move to build its first U.S. plant in Wisconsin. But despite Foxconn\u2019s promise to hire 13,000 employees, the Wall Street Journal reports that the tight labor market now has the company considering whether to bring in Chinese workers.\n\nFoxconn told the Journal that its \u201cWisconsin first commitment remains unchanged\u201d and that it still plans to hire 13,000 workers for \u201chigh-value production and engineering assignments and in the research and development field.\u201d More from the Wall Street Journal here.\n\nLAWSUIT OVER FINGERPRINT DELAYS: A class-action lawsuit filed Tuesday says new fingerprint checks for potential sponsors of detained unaccompanied migrant children have delayed the minors\u2019 release. \u201cThese delays have caused the length of time that children spend in government custody to spike dramatically,\u201d the complaint says, \u201cand the total number of children in government custody to balloon to its highest in history.\u201d The Wall Street Journal reported in October that the average length of stay for an unaccompanied minor in federal custody stood at 59 days \u2014 a 44 percent increase from the previous year. Read the complaint here.\n\nSTOCK FOR GIG WORKERS: As more apps such as Airbnb, Uber and Lyft weigh going public (Uber was recently valued at $120 billion), the Securities and Exchange Commission may make it easier for gig workers classified as independent contractors to own stock in these companies, David Gelles reports for The New York Times.\n\nFederal securities law, Gelles reports, bars private companies from issuing shares to contractors. \u201cIn considering a change, the S.E.C. is tacitly acknowledging that for all the value gig economy companies are creating, they are also, in some ways, contributing to the stark income inequality that is roiling society,\u201d he writes. But if the rules are changed and gig workers receive stock without a way to sell it, Gelles warns that workers \u201ccould be liable for taxes on those gains, without having any easy way\u201d to pay them. More from the Times here.\n\nCoffee Break\n\n\u2014 \u201cMost rich democracies don\u2019t hold their elections during the workweek,\u201d from The Washington Post\n\n\u2014 \u201cGoogle Workers Reject Silicon Valley Individualism in Walkout,\u201d from The New York Times\n\n\u2014 Opinion: \u201cThe missing piece of NAFTA 2.0,\u201d from The Hill\n\n\u2014 \u201cBeyond the Stigma: State launching push to promote 'recovery-friendly' workplaces,\u201d from the New Hampshire Union Leader\n\n\u2014 \u201cGov't workers have most paid parental leave days on average, despite lack of federal policy,\u201d from HR Dive\n\nTHAT\u2019S ALL FOR MORNING SHIFT.", "House Democrats expected to ramp up oversight of DeVos\n\nEditor's Note: This edition of Free Morning Education is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Education subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pro's comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy tools and services, click here.\n\nHOUSE DEMOCRATS EXPECTED TO RAMP UP OVERSIGHT OF DEVOS: Democrats seized control of the House on Tuesday night, likely placing Rep. Bobby Scott in charge of the House education committee. And that means the hot seat is about to get even hotter for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. More from Kimberly Hefling.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2014 Democrats on the campaign trail this cycle used DeVos as a symbol of what's wrong with President Donald Trump\u2019s policies, pushing ads that portrayed her as an out-of-touch billionaire and enemy of public education intent on unraveling civil rights and higher education consumer protections. With Democrats\u2019 takeover of the House, they gain new authority to propel DeVos \u2014 and her top aides \u2014 to testify or turn over documents.\n\n\u2014 The stage is set for at least two showdowns in the coming months \u2014 the Trump administration will soon propose a new regulation on the handling of campus sexual assault cases under Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs. And a White House school safety commission led by DeVos is set to release a report on its findings since the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. The Trump administration\u2019s push to unravel Obama-era regulations aimed at the for-profit college industry and its handling of state plans under the Every Student Succeeds Act are also areas that Democrats will likely target for oversight.\n\n\u2014 Scott (D-Va.) is expected to lead the way. A veteran lawmaker and stalwart on civil rights who was the first African-American elected to Congress from Virginia since Reconstruction, he has been ranking member since 2015. During that time, he helped negotiate the bipartisan ESSA, the federal education law that replaced No Child Left Behind. Two of Scott\u2019s staffers \u2014 Jacque Mosely and V\u00e9ronique Pluviose \u2014 will likely play a more prominent role now that Democrats hold the majority. Read up on Scott here.\n\n\u2014 Look to Scott to push a legislative agenda focused on passage of his Rebuild America\u2019s Schools Act, H.R. 2475 (115), which would invest billions of dollars in new funding into improving school infrastructure. Another big priority is an update to the Higher Education Act \u2014 a heavy lift under any political environment, but an item high on the wish list for many in higher education circles. Some education wonks are hopeful about a split Congress making progress on legislation, particularly when it comes to HEA and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the federal law governing the privacy of student education records. Read more on Democrats\u2019 plans.\n\n\u2014 Meanwhile, Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), the Republican chairwoman of the House education committee, defeated her opponent D.D. Adams on Tuesday night. Adams, a Democrat, serves on the Winston-Salem City Council. Scott ran unopposed.\n\nIT\u2019S WEDNESDAY, NOV. 7. WELCOME TO MORNING EDUCATION. You made it through Election Day!

As a result, there\u2019s something for everyone when it comes to school funding, school choice and other issues. Gubernatorial and state legislative races could have the biggest effect on education policy in the states. Here are the results from some of the races our team has been watching closely:\n\n\u2014 WISCONSIN: Tony Evers, the Democrat in charge of the state\u2019s public school system, defeated Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who was seeking a third term as governor. The close race pitted Walker in the fight of his political life, forcing him to grapple with his record on education \u2014 one that included funding cuts during the early years of his administration and a 2010 law that essentially gutted the state teachers union.\n\n\u2014 GEORGIA: The race between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp, in another nail-biter of a gubernatorial race plagued with voting drama, had not been called by early today. While both pledged to invest more in public education, Abrams proposed eliminating the state\u2019s tax credit scholarship program and Kemp said he\u2019d maintain it.\n\n\u2014 FLORIDA: Democrat Andrew Gillum conceded to Republican Ron DeSantis in a tight race that attracted national attention. Gillum pledged to raise the corporate income tax rate from 5.5 percent to 7.75 percent to raise $1 billion for public schools, boost teachers\u2019 starting salaries to $50,000 and shut down school choice in the Sunshine State. DeSantis backed more school choice options and merit-based pay for teachers, rather than an across-the-board pay raise.\n\n\u2014 NEW MEXICO: Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, won the open seat against GOP Rep. Steve Pearce. Grisham campaigned on a plan to fund universal preschool, while Pearce campaigned in favor of improving traditional K-12 schools. A new governor will likely mean changes for the state\u2019s plan for holding schools accountable under ESSA \u2014 both candidates favored scrapping the Common Core-aligned PARCC test and overhauling the state\u2019s teacher evaluation system.\n\n\u2014 OKLAHOMA: Republican Kevin Stitt beat Democrat Drew Edmondson \u2014 a disappointing result for the grassroots #RedforEd movement that grew out of widespread teacher unrest and called for big investments in public education funding. Edmonson supported the tax hikes designed to fund teacher raises in the state, which came in response to massive teacher walkouts earlier this year. But Stitt told the Tulsa World in June that he didn\u2019t support the measure or new taxes.\n\n\u2014 OHIO: Richard Cordray, a Democrat and President Barack Obama\u2019s former head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, lost to Mike DeWine, the state\u2019s Republican attorney general. Throughout the race, Democrats sought to tie DeWine to the collapse of a massive online charter school.\n\n\u2014 KANSAS: Democrat Laura Kelly defeated Republican Kris Kobach, the Trump-supported candidate and secretary of state who backed a state law that would require 75 percent of school funding to be spent on classroom instruction. Kobach tweeted in June: \u201cClassrooms are my priority. \u2018Crystal Palaces\u2019 to house bureaucrats, designer atriums and exclusive staff-only fitness centers and aerobics studios are not my priority.\u201d Kelly, a state senator, pledged to direct more money to schools after the Kansas Supreme Court ruled that the state had to increase education funding.\n\n\u2014 ARIZONA: Republican Gov. Doug Ducey beat David Garcia, a professor with a background in education policy. The state was one of several this year where teachers went on strike and school funding and private school choice were prominent issues in the race. Ducey, who led Garcia in the polls, often pointed to the measure he signed earlier this year to address the teacher unrest, providing teachers with a 20 percent raise by 2020.\n\n\u2014 COLORADO: Rep. Jared Polis, a Democrat, defeated Republican state Treasurer Walker Stapleton. Polis, a member of the House education committee who founded two charter schools, has called for more school funding and campaigned on a pledge to make preschool and full-day kindergarten free. He\u2019ll be the first openly gay governor in the U.S.\n\n\u2014 ILLINOIS: Teachers unions were eager to oust Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who lost on Tuesday night to his Democratic opponent, billionaire J.B. Pritzker. In polls, Rauner had trailed Pritzker, who has funded early childhood education efforts nationwide. Rauner was at war with teachers unions in the state \u2014 in 2015, he launched the lawsuit that would eventually become the Janus case.\n\n\u2014 MICHIGAN: Teachers unions were also campaigning in the final days for Gretchen Whitmer, who defeated Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette after leading him in the polls.\n\nHOW EDUCATION BALLOT INITIATIVES FARED: School funding, school choice, religious displays in schools and education governance questions were among the issues decided by voters on Tuesday. Here are some of the results:\n\n\u2014 ARIZONA: Voters rejected an expansion of the state\u2019s education savings account program, which allows families to draw public funds to pay for private school tuition and other education-related expenses. The question was added to the ballot after public school advocates successfully collected enough signatures in protest of the law. A Suffolk University/Arizona Republic poll last month suggested that voters were confused about what the ballot initiative would do.\n\n\u2014 ALABAMA: Voters overwhelmingly backed a referendum allowing the Ten Commandments to be displayed in schools and other public buildings \u2014 as long as it's part of a display with historical or educational items.\n\n\u2014 COLORADO: Voters rejected an initiative that would raise corporate taxes and state income taxes for people earning $150,000 annually. It's estimated that $1.6 billion would have been generated for K-12 education.\n\n\u2014 OKLAHOMA: Voters narrowly rejected a ballot initiative that would\u2019ve allowed school leaders to tap into funding typically reserved for school construction and use it in other ways, like for increasing teacher salaries. Stitt supported the measure, but Edmondson said it could increase disparities among school districts and could be used by the state legislature as a way to avoid spending on public education.\n\n\u2014 SOUTH CAROLINA: Voters shot down a ballot initiative that would allow the governor to appoint the state superintendent of education starting in 2023 \u2014 keeping the superintendent position an elected office.\n\nVOTERS PICK STATE EDUCATION CHIEFS: Voters in seven states elected a new state school chief. Here are the results:\n\n\u2014 CALIFORNIA: The race between Marshall Tuck and fellow Democrat Tony Thurmond had not been called by early today. The race was closely watched, in part, because it generated more than $40 million in contributions. Tuck, the former president of a charter school organization who also was the CEO of an initiative that runs 18 district schools in Los Angeles, lost his bid for the nonpartisan seat in 2014. He was the heavy favorite among members of the education reform community, which favors charter schools. Thurmond, a Democratic state legislator and former social worker, had the backing of teachers unions.\n\n\u2014 ARIZONA: The race between Democrat Kathy Hoffman, a speech pathologist and political newcomer with ties to the #RedforEd teacher strike movement, and Frank Riggs, a Republican charter school executive and former California congressman, had not been called by early today. The two tangled over issues of experience, oversight of charter schools, school funding and school safety.\n\n\u2014 OKLAHOMA: State Superintendent of Public Instruction Joy Hofmeister, a Republican, held her post against Democrat John Cox, the superintendent of rural Peggs Public Schools. The race, in a year in which the state saw an uprising among teachers, was a rematch between the two, who also faced off in 2014. Larry Huff, a retired educator, also ran for the seat as an independent.\n\n\u2014 GEORGIA: Richard Woods, the state\u2019s Republican state superintendent, held off a challenge from Otha Thornton, a retired Army officer running as a Democrat. Thornton was the first black male president of the National PTA.\n\n\u2014 IDAHO: The race between Democrat Cindy Wilson, a high school government teacher, and incumbent Republican Sherri Ybarra, also a former teacher and school administrator, had not been called by early today. Wilson campaigned on improving early childhood education and criticized a $20 million school safety proposal by Ybarra that focused heavily on hiring school security personnel.\n\n\u2014 SOUTH CAROLINA: After shooting down a referendum that would have given the governor power to appoint the state's superintendent starting in 2023, voters reelected Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman, a Republican. Spearman, a former teacher and school administrator who supported having the governor make the appointment, was unopposed. Her opponent, Democrat Israel Romero, a former teacher and professor, dropped out of the race before the election.\n\n\u2014 WYOMING: Jillian Balow, a Republican who is the current superintendent of public instruction, ran unopposed. Balow is a former teacher who worked in various state administration positions before being elected in 2014.\n\nTEACHERS RUNNING FOR OFFICE: The National Education Association has identified 1,800 educators running for state legislative seats. Its count includes current and retired teachers and those who work in higher education. In a year that was awash with teacher unrest, several of the teacher candidates in Oklahoma, Arizona, West Virginia and elsewhere said they were motivated by school funding issues to run. NEA, which is tracking the outcomes of the teacher races, didn\u2019t have a count of how many won on Tuesday night.\n\n\u2014 Outside of state legislative races: One of the most high-profile teacher candidates for federal office was Jahana Hayes, a Democratic candidate for the House in Connecticut who defeated Republican Manny Santos. Hayes was the 2016 National Teacher of the Year.\n\n\u2014 Two education activists who ran for Congress: West Virginia state legislator Richard Ojeda, who became a hero among teachers striking in the state earlier this year, ran as a Democrat for West Virginia\u2019s 3rd District. He lost to Republican Carol Miller. And in Alaska, independent Alyse Galvin unsuccessfully sought to unseat Republican Rep. Don Young. In early 2017, Galvin launched a campaign to urge both of Alaska\u2019s senators to reject DeVos\u2019 confirmation.\n\nAffirmative Action\n\nMARK YOUR CALENDARS: In non-midterm-related news, arguments have been scheduled for Feb. 13 in the closely watched court case over Harvard University\u2019s use of race in admissions. The university is defending itself against a lawsuit that claims its admissions process is unfair to Asian-American applicants. Earlier this month, three weeks of testimony in the case wrapped up. But Judge Allison Burroughs offered both sides a chance to make a last round of arguments.\n\nREPORT ROLL CALL\n\n\u2014 Children tend to have higher levels of school engagement when involved in one or more activities, like sports, lessons or clubs, according to a new report from the Census Bureau.\n\n\u2014 A new report by the Institute of Education Sciences finds that the average tuition and required fees at four-year public institutions increased more than 2 percent for both in-state and out-of-state students, when adjusted for inflation, between 2015-16 and 2017-18. A separate report released by IES found that public four-year institutions received about 21 percent of their revenues from tuition and fees in fiscal 2017.\n\nSYLLABUS\n\n\u2014 Gov.-elect Bill Lee says Tennessee schools rank in the nation\u2019s bottom.

What will emboldened House Democrats try to get done? The Russia investigation in the House Intelligence Committee should roar back to life. The party has vowed to devote considerably more funding for election security. Long-stalled data breach legislation will get a fresh push and a more aggressive bent. And Democrats promise to take a more hawkish posture on supply chain threats. Pros can read our full breakdown here.\n\nKEY RACE RESULTS \u2014 Claire McCaskill, top Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, lost reelection. On that panel, she has placed a big emphasis on supply chain security. She sponsored legislation (S. 3085) to create a council that would evaluate the government's risks when purchasing IT and communications technology from companies like Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab. The panel approved that bill in September.\n\nLast month, McCaskill joined with Chairman Ron Johnson in seeking a briefing on a controversial Bloomberg story that reported China had implanted chips into hardware used by major U.S. companies. McCaskill earlier this year found herself the target of hackers who tried to infiltrate her office network, without success. The attacks, traced to Russia, were a response to her vocal stance against the Kremlin's aggression in cyberspace, McCaskill said.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on both the Senate Commerce Committee and Armed Services Cybersecurity Subcommittee, appeared to lose his reelection bid. Nelson took heat this year for remarks about Russian hackers getting into Florida\u2019s voter registration system.\n\nIn the House, Will Hurd appears to have won, although not without late drama. He\u2019s the chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee on Information Technology and one of Congress\u2019 leading cybersecurity voices. Republican Rep. Tom Reed defeated Democratic challenger Tracy Mitrano, a cyber specialist who argued Congress needs more lawmakers who are digitally savvy.\n\nDEM LEADERS\u2019 OVERSIGHT PRIORITIES \u2014 The incoming class of expected Democratic committee chairmen often team up on cybersecurity oversight, such as when they released a joint statement just last month about a briefing from Trump administration officials they said contradicted the president\u2019s claims about Chinese election interference. But each have offered clues about their specific agenda.\n\nOn the Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Bennie Thompson is a persistent, across-the-board critic of the Trump administration\u2019s cybersecurity policies and practices, and he has focused heavily on election security as co-chair of a Democratic task force with his House Administration counterpart Robert Brady. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on Judiciary, has asked for committee hearings into DHS\u2019 conclusion that Russia was able to access voter registration systems in 2016, and top Energy and Commerce Democrat Frank Pallone has prodded the panel to hold hearings on 2016 election interference, too.\n\nOn the Foreign Affairs Committee, top Democrat Eliot Engel has asked for a panel investigation into the one-on-one meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Top House Oversight Democrat Elijah Cummings sought a committee subpoena about former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s decision to eliminate the department\u2019s cybersecurity office. House Science ranking Democrat Eddie Bernice Johnson has asked the panel leadership to investigate cybersecurity missteps regarding mobile phone practices in the Trump White House.\n\nOUTGOING GOP LEADERS \u2014 The ranks of GOP committee leaders in the House will thin considerably on panels with a cybersecurity focus. Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul hit a GOP-imposed term limit. Judiciary\u2019s Bob Goodlatte, Oversight\u2019s Trey Gowdy, Science\u2019s Lamar Smith, Foreign Affairs\u2019 Ed Royce, Administration\u2019s Gregg Harper and Appropriations\u2019 Rodney Frelinghuysen are all retiring.\n\nA number of key subcommittee leaders are exiting, too. Science\u2019s Research and Technology Subcommittee Chairwoman Barbara Comstock and House Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee Chairman Kevin Yoder both lost. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who chairs The Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, won her bid for a Senate seat.\n\nHAPPY WEDNESDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

Topics include \u201cImproving the financial stability of military families\u201d and \u201cUsing tech to tackle the high unemployment rate of military spouses.\u201d RSVP here.\n\nNO BIG INTERRUPTIONS \u2026 \u2014 DHS and its information sharing teammates didn\u2019t pick up any evidence that foreign hackers or anyone else compromised election infrastructure Tuesday, department officials told reporters repeatedly throughout the day in a series of background briefings. Most of the calls took just several minutes, as there wasn\u2019t much to report. There were plenty of technical problems on Tuesday, but \"we continue to not see any sort of malicious actor indications behind any of these events,\" a DHS official said in the afternoon. The department and watchdog group Common Cause did, however, see some misinformation campaigns on social media, but posts were swiftly removed.\n\nFacebook\u2019s cybersecurity chief Nathaniel Gleicher confirmed just before midnight Tuesday that the action it took against 115 accounts on Facebook and Instagram a night prior was due to \u201cconcerns that they were linked to the Russia-based Internet Research Agency (IRA) and engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior.\u201d Gleicher added that the company blocked more Instagram accounts Tuesday after a website claiming to be tied to the IRA published a list of pages they created, though he did not specify how many. \u201cWe had already blocked most of these accounts yesterday, and have now blocked the rest,\u201d he said, per our friends at Morning Tech.\n\n... BUT THE SHOW ISN\u2019T OVER \u2014 DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Tuesday she is worried about foreign agitators portraying the results of the election as invalid, because it could foster mistrust in U.S. democracy. \u201cThey win if they sow any doubt,\u201d she said at a press conference. Other DHS officials and cybersecurity experts share that fear. Alex Stamos, Facebook\u2019s former security chief, raised the subject during a discussion on Twitter about voter fraud and suppression. \u201cThis will happen from domestic groups no matter the outcome, with varying levels of evidence,\u201d said Stamos, now a fellow at Stanford University. \u201cThe wildcard is whether any organized actors are planning on taking credit for any wins or will claim to have hacked election infrastructure.\u201d\n\nABOUT THOSE IVANKA VOTING MACHINES \u2014 A spokesman for Ivanka Trump\u2019s ethics attorney offered further information Tuesday about why she received approval for a trademark on voting machines. \u201cThese trademark applications were filed in the first half of 2016, well before President Trump won the election or Ms. Trump joined the Administration,\u201d said Peter Mirijanian on behalf of the attorney, Abbe Lowell. \u201cThese trademarks were sought to broadly protect Ms. Trump\u2019s name, and to prevent others from stealing her name and using it to sell their products. This is a common trademark practice, which is why the trademark applications were granted.\u201d\n\nBE BETTER BUILDERS \u2014 The technical standards agency NIST has released a guide showing how manufacturers can improve their cybersecurity practices, and the agency is seeking public comments on it. \u201cThe examples provided in this [document] demonstrate how detecting anomalous conditions can improve the reliability of manufacturing and other [industrial control systems], in addition to providing the demonstrated cybersecurity benefits,\u201d the document\u2019s introduction says. The guide offers advice for deploying behavioral anomaly detection, or BAD, capabilities, in two example scenarios: \u201ca collaborative robotics-based manufacturing system and a process control 247 system (PCS) that resembles what is being used by chemical manufacturing industries.\u201d The document is part of a NIST project to help manufacturers assess their vulnerabilities and improve their defenses. The public comment period runs through Dec. 6.\n\nTEHRAN AND ON AND ON \u2014 Newly reimposed U.S. sanctions could spur Iran\u2019s hackers to get more aggressive around the globe, according to a report from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cNo nation has felt the full power of U.S. economic coercion quite like Iran, and therefore no regime is better positioned to understand how attacks on economic assets can undermine a nation\u2019s military capabilities,\u201d said Samantha Ravich, senior adviser and principal investigator of FDD\u2019s Cyber-Enabled Economic Warfare project.\n\nTWEET OF THE DAY \u2014 To me, that\u2019s preposterous. Crabs on Krebs, things of that nature.\n\nPEOPLE ON THE MOVE\n\n\u2014 President Donald Trump this week announced the appointment of Brian Harrell to the position of assistant secretary for infrastructure protection at DHS. Harrell previously served as managing director of enterprise security at Duke Energy. He also previously served as director for critical infrastructure protection programs at the North American Electric Reliability Corp. and director of the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center.\n\nQUICK BYTES\n\n\u2014 \u201c'Almost all' Pakistani banks hacked in security breach.\u201d Dawn\n\n\u2014 HSBC said a small percentage of its U.S. bank customers\u2019 accounts was hacked. BBC\n\n\u2014 Georgia voters filed suit against Secretary of State Brian Kemp to prevent him from administering the election while running for governor, partially citing his controversial last-minute investigation of the state Democratic party over hacking claims.

LONG NIGHT: With Democrats set to take charge of the House next year, the pressure\u2019s on House Ag Chairman Mike Conaway to get a farm bill done in the lame-duck session to salvage conservative elements of his bill. Also on the Democrats\u2019 ag agenda: USDA oversight.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2014 Senate Republicans padded their majority thanks in large part to farm-state races. Democrats also pulled off some upsets in Midwestern gubernatorial and House contests.\n\n\u2014 A new reality for the Trump trade agenda: House Democrats will have a hand in controlling the fate of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and any trade deals that follow.\n\n\u2014 Missed any of the results Tuesday night? MA\u2019s got you covered, from ag-flavored House, Senate and governor\u2019s races to ballot initiatives.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT FOR THE FARM BILL: House Republicans have a SNAP decision to make. Conaway and the GOP conference have to consider whether to give ground on some of the biggest farm bill disputes \u2014 like conservation, commodity policy, and, of course, work requirements for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients \u2014 to get a bill passed this year. Striking a deal while they still have the majority would help House Republicans preserve some of their priorities before they lose leverage, our Catherine Boudreau writes today.\n\nIf there\u2019s no lame-duck deal: House Democrats could start from scratch when the new Congress begins next year. That may not be something industry wants to see. The Democratic members could seek to pull the farm bill to the left with amendments to rein in subsidies for wealthy farmers or to adjust federal crop insurance.\n\n\u2014 Ranking member Collin Peterson, who won a close race Tuesday and is expected to retake the House Agriculture gavel, has said he doesn\u2019t want to start over and write his own farm bill. (The Minnesota Democrat has embraced the Senate-passed bill, S. 3042 (115), which drew bipartisan support.)\n\n\u201cI think the farm bill gets done pretty fast,\u201d said Callie Eideberg, senior policy manager at the Environmental Defense Fund. Chuck Conner, president of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, said he thinks Conaway \u201cwanted this thing done in the lame-duck no matter what\u201d the election outcome was.\n\nOn the other hand: Sen. Chuck Grassley predicted Democrats will wait to restart the farm bill process in 2019 so they can write legislation without the SNAP provisions in the current House measure, H.R. 2 (115). \u201cI would guess, unless the House very quickly backs down on food stamps, that we\u2019re going to have a one-year extension and debate a new farm bill next year,\u201d the Iowa Republican told reporters on a conference call.\n\nTHE HOUSE AG AGENDA: Beyond the farm bill, Democrats will be in position to exert tougher oversight on USDA and push for action on immigration reform.\n\n\u2014 Secretary Sonny Perdue\u2019s plans to relocate two USDA research agencies outside of Washington next year could face more scrutiny. Democrats will also keep closer tabs on the trade pain across U.S. farm regions, as well as USDA\u2019s mitigation efforts.\n\n\u2014 Moderating factor: Peterson is arguably the chamber\u2019s most conservative Democrat, so the committee\u2019s leftward shift probably won\u2019t be as dramatic as on other House panels.\n\nHAPPY WEDNESDAY, NOV. 7!

So did Nebraska Republican Deb Fischer.\n\n\u2014 Most House Ag lawmakers also earned new terms. But some of the Republican members might lose their committee seats when the panel is reapportioned to reflect the new majority.\n\n\u2014 Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who\u2019s been a vocal defender of SNAP on House Ag, was elected governor of New Mexico. She\u2019ll be the first Latina Democrat to serve in that role. Democrat Tim Walz was elected Minnesota governor.\n\n\u2014 Republican Pete Stauber won the open Minnesota seat now held by retiring Democratic Rep. Rick Nolan, who had held onto his seat in 2016 even as his district voted for President Donald Trump.\n\nWHO\u2019S OUT: Joe Donnelly and Heidi Heitkamp. The Senate Ag Committee Democrats, two of the party\u2019s most vulnerable members, were both unseated in red states that voted for Trump in 2016. Donnelly was defeated by Republican Mike Braun in Indiana, while Heitkamp lost handily to Rep. Kevin Cramer.\n\n\u2014 House Rules Chairman Pete Sessions lost to Democrat Colin Allred. The Texas Republican was one of the highest-ranking lawmakers to go down.\n\n\u2014 Just one House Ag Republican had lost to a Democratic challenger by the time MA reached its extended deadline early this morning: Rep. John Faso in New York. Reps. Rodney Davis (Ill.) and Steve King (Iowa) held on in close races.\n\nTBD: In the Mississippi Senate special election, Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, another Agriculture Committee member, will face former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy in a runoff on Nov. 27.\n\n\u2014 In California\u2019s Central Valley, Republican Rep. Jeff Denham was in a toss-up race that hadn\u2019t been called by MA\u2019s deadline.\n\nMIXED RESULTS ACROSS MIDWEST: Anyone wondering if Trump\u2019s trade war \u2014 and the challenges it\u2019s raised for farmers and ranchers \u2014 would dampen GOP support in midterm races in agricultural areas\u2026 didn\u2019t get a clear answer on Tuesday. Election results from the Midwest were all over the place.\n\nRepublicans swept the Senate races in Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota and Tennessee. But Democrats picked off House seats or governorships in states like Illinois, Iowa and Kansas. ICYMI, here are a few more eyebrow-raising results from the heartland:\n\n\u2014 Democrats\u2019 big day in Kansas: Laura Kelly beat Republican Kris Kobach for the governorship, and Sharice Davids defeated GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder.\n\n\u2014 In Iowa: Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds was elected to a full term, while Democratic challengers defeated two of the state\u2019s three House Republican incumbents.\n\n\u2014 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker lost his reelection bid to Democrat Tony Evers. Democrats also flipped the governor\u2019s mansions in Illinois and Michigan.\n\nBLUE HOUSE MAKES LABOR KEY TO USMCA APPROVAL: With Democrats in charge of the House, the path to ratification for the new North American trade pact just got a little bit steeper. Trump\u2019s signature trade achievement could still be approved in 2019, but Democrats are now in position to demand changes to labor and environmental provisions in the deal, Pro Trade\u2019s Adam Behsudi reports today.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats are not going to make it easy for political reasons, but there\u2019s a path there,\u201d said Bill Reinsch, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He predicted Democrats will say \u201cnot good enough\u201d on the agreement\u2019s labor language and tell Trump\u2019s trade officials to \u201cgo back to Mexico and do better.\u201d\n\nLabor groups could be instrumental in brokering a political understanding on trade between Trump and congressional Democrats to advance the new North American trade pact. Labor unions have already called for changes to the deal. Labor and environmental improvements could be less of a factor in potential trade deals with economically advanced economies like Japan and the EU.\n\nChange of power at Ways and Means: Massachusetts Rep. Richard Neal is in line to take charge of the House panel that oversees trade policy. Pro Trade\u2019s Sabrina Rodriguez dives into Neal\u2019s record here.\n\nROW CROPS\n\n\u2014 What can get done in a divided Congress: POLITICO\u2019s Megan Casella, Nancy Cook and Gabby Orr take a look at the balance Democrats will need to strike between liberal activists shouting for impeachment and party leaders pushing for cooperation on issues like infrastructure, drug pricing and immigration. Pros, fast-forward to 2019 right here.\n\n\u2014 Bipartisanship, sorta: Grassley said he might work better with a Democratic chairman than Conaway on one of his farm bill priorities: limiting subsidy payments to farmland owners who don\u2019t live or work on the farm. (He clarified that he wasn\u2019t rooting for a Democratic takeover.) Your host has more.\n\n\u2014 Soda tax ballot initiatives: Oregon voters rejected ballot Measure 103, which would have banned new taxes on soda throughout the state, the Oregonian reports. Washington voters, on the other hand, appeared to have approved a similar measure, Initiative 1634, after the soda industry poured $20 million into the effort. More from the Olympian here.\n\n\u2014 Arkansas Plant Board votes to OK in-crop dicamba use: The board tentatively approved a \u201cpetition for rulemaking\u201d from farmers that seeks a June 15 cutoff date for spraying the herbicide next year; spraying after that date would be acceptable only through a special permit. One farmer told the board that dicamba is needed to fight pigweed, which has grown resistant to other herbicides. Here\u2019s the Arkansas Democrat Gazette\u2019s story.\n\n\u2014 Farm sentiment jumps post-NAFTA deal: A monthly index from Purdue University and the CME Group found that producer sentiment about the farm economy was up about 19 percent from September. Optimism over the new North American trade pact, announced Sept. 30, juiced farm sentiment, according to producers surveyed.\n\n\u2014 FDA approves first drug to reduce animal gas: The agency on Tuesday signed off on Experior, from animal health company Elanco, a drug that can reduce ammonia gas emissions from beef cattle waste. Here\u2019s the announcement.\n\n\u2014 Smithfield, EDF team up on butterfly habitats: The Environmental Defense Fund and pork producer Smithfield Foods are restoring monarch butterfly habitats around the edges of a Smithfield farm in northern Missouri. The butterfly population has declined as much as 95 percent since the 1980s, Fast Company reports. One reason: Pesticide and herbicide use on farms has killed off native milkweed plants, where the monarchs lay their eggs.\n\n\u2014 USDA extends use of paper pots in organics: The department will allow organic farmers to continue using paper pots until further notice, Organic Insider writes.

She said he has demonstrated a willingness to work across the aisle in the past, and is willing to work on DACA and opioid regulation with Democrats. Though both parties passed legislation to combat the nation's opioid crisis this year, immigration legislation has stalled over differences including funding for Trump's border wall.\n\nConway said Trump spoke with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on the phone Tuesday night and that he would discuss the conversation at a news conference slated for later Wednesday.", "President Donald Trump called Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday night to congratulate her, and a spokesperson for Pelosi said that Trump \u201cacknowledged\u201d calls for bipartisanship made in her victory speech. | Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images White House Trump threatens retaliatory investigations if Dems push oversight\n\nPresident Donald Trump warned Wednesday that Democrats preparing to ramp up oversight of his administration when they take over the House majority next year could find themselves on the receiving end of retaliatory investigations courtesy of Senate Republicans.\n\nThe president said Democrats could face investigation for leaking classified information, an allegation he leveled without offering evidence to back it up.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level.

If that happens, senior Democratic officials say Mueller would likely get an immediate summons to Capitol Hill for nationally televised testimony about his findings.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

So taxpayers would have a right to know what Mr. Mueller found.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 midterm victory also gives Mueller company in his search for answers about what happened more than two years ago between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russian hackers accused of stealing Democratic emails and releasing them in a bid to help a rookie Republican politician win the White House.\n\nRepublicans had embarked on sporadic efforts to interview key witnesses tied to the 2016 election but Democrats had long complained that the hearings were window dressing for a broader effort to discredit Mueller and his probe.\n\nNow, Democrats have the power to act on dozens of their own long-bridled demands for information and witness interviews \u2014 and can share their findings freely with Mueller.\n\nThey plan to ship dozens of transcripts \u2014 collected during interviews with the likes of longtime Trump associate Roger Stone and Donald Trump Jr. \u2014 to Mueller for possible prosecution on perjury charges. They want Justice Department briefings on allegations Trump directed his then-personal attorney Michael Cohen to break campaign finance laws during the 2016 White House race in order to silence an adult film actress who claimed to have had an affair with Trump.\n\nThey\u2019re also in position to examine Trump\u2019s pardon powers, which they\u2019ve warned the president might try to use to insulate himself from legal exposure in the wake of guilty pleas from Cohen and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has said he\u2019s planning to re-open his panel\u2019s shuttered Russia investigation using as a road map a list of about 70 people, organizations and companies Democrats say the GOP failed to adequately examine.\n\nEarly Wednesday morning, Schiff also said Democrats have an opportunity to finally do what their Republican colleagues refused to \u2014 protect Mueller.\n\n\u201cI think that the chances that Bob Mueller will be able to finish his work improved for the reason that our committee and others like the Government Reform Committee and the Judiciary Committee, which under Republican leadership served as basically surrogates for the president in their efforts to batter down the Justice Department, to give the president a pretext \u2026 to fire people in the Justice Department, all of that tearing down of the independence of these institutions is going to end,\u201d Schiff said on MSNBC. \u201cNow that doesn\u2019t mean the president can\u2019t still act in ways that are antithetical to the rule of law and the interest of justice, but it does mean that we\u2019re better able to protect our institutions and see this investigation, I hope, complete.\u201d\n\nSensing Democrats\u2019 eagerness to exercise their newfound power, Trump on Wednesday morning issued a pre-emptive strike.\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level. Two can play that game!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nAnd while Pelosi has so far publicly urged restraint to make sure her colleagues don\u2019t overplay their hand and invite a public backlash, new avenues of Democratic inquiry are also expected. They include a subpoena to finally see Trump\u2019s personal tax returns and a closer examination into allegations the Trump Organization has been a haven for money laundering.\n\nCampaigning in Indiana on Monday, Trump shrugged off a question about whether Democrats will soon turn up the pressure on him by demanding his tax filings.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d the president said. \u201cThey can do whatever they want, and I can do whatever I want.\u201d\n\nTop White House adviser Kellyanne Conway struck a similar note Wednesday morning when asked on CNN whether Trump was nervous about Democrats trying to get his tax returns.\n\n\u201cThey may try. They may try,\u201d Conway said. \u201cThe president is not nervous about anything.\u201d\n\nWhile House Democrats are expected to turn up the heat on Trump beginning in January, the newly emboldened lawmakers seem unlikely always to be on the same page as Mueller.\n\nNew congressional digging into ground the special counsel has already trod \u2014 some publicly, some behind the scenes \u2014 could create legal complications. But while the incoming Democratic leadership team has pledged not to step on Mueller\u2019s toes, its members also recognize their own political challenges that come with the start of a new presidential campaign cycle and a new crop of freshmen lawmakers who will be agitating for impeachment and aggressive oversight into the president\u2019s behavior.\n\nDemocrats also must deal with the reality that the special counsel\u2019s end game remains a mystery. Sure, Mueller has fueled speculation he might be winding down through his quick pace in prosecuting several top former Trump aides and most recently by shedding a couple of prosecutors.\n\nBut Mueller also still has no public deadline to finish his work, and some experts in presidential investigations caution against jumping too quick to conclusions on when the probe will be over.\n\n\u201cI think Mueller\u2019s mindset is you can\u2019t still be investigating 2016 as 2020 approaches. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s determined to get back to the rest of his life,\u201d said John Q. Barrett, a former associate counsel who worked under independent counsel Lawrence Walsh during the Reagan-era investigation into secret U.S. arms sales to Iran.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that we\u2019re looking at something that is going to be a few more years,\u201d he added. \u201cOn the other hand, the facts will determine that. An investigation is what an investigation finds.\u201d\n\nMueller\u2019s calendar through the end of 2018 is packed with sentencing dates for several one-time Trump associates who have since become cooperating witnesses. The special counsel\u2019s prosecutors and attorneys for Manafort have a Nov. 16 deadline to file their next status report with the courts. Cohen has a sentencing date set for Dec. 12 in New York, where he pleaded guilty in a case referred by Mueller\u2019s office. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn also has a sentencing date set for Dec. 18.\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s lawyers are also scheduled to appear in federal appeals court in Washington D.C. on Thursday for oral arguments in a case involving an aide to longtime Trump associate Roger Stone challenging the constitutionality of Mueller\u2019s appointment and his subpoena powers.\n\nMore criminal prosecutions also appear to be in the works. Stone has been bracing for months for an indictment as he\u2019s watched about a dozen of his associates testify before the special counsel\u2019s grand jury in Washington.\n\nTrump\u2019s own legal culpability remains a mystery, too.\n\nMueller\u2019s shown no cards yet in his determination into whether the president obstructed justice when he fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. Trump, meantime, said publicly for months that he was willing to testify to the special counsel but he has since backed away from that offer, with his lawyers now insisting that the most the Russia investigator will get are written answers after the midterms.\n\nIn Congress, House Democratic aides say they\u2019ve been looking for ways to build off a letter their members penned while in the minority that would amplify the pressure on the president to sit down for an interview with Mueller.\n\nThen there\u2019s impeachment. Some freshmen Democrats elected Tuesday campaigned on a pledge to begin the controversial removal process with Trump. They\u2019ll arrive in Washington facing off against a leadership team that\u2019s been warning about the potential for overreach and with many veterans from the Bill Clinton impeachment saga who are urging patience as Mueller finishes his work.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be clear evidence of conduct that is impeachable and right now we don\u2019t know of any,\u201d said Julian Epstein, a chief counsel for House Judiciary Committee Democrats during the 1998-99 Clinton impeachment fight. \u201cIt all depends on what the Mueller report will produce.\u201d\n\nEven with the Democrats\u2019 victory, Mueller\u2019s Justice Department supervisors are also likely to be different in the not-so-distant future.\n\nTrump\u2019s patience has grown increasingly thin with both Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and the two officials appear headed for the exits. Democrats say that how the White House goes about those moves \u2014 and whom he picks as replacements \u2014 will be watched closely for any sign that Trump and his aides are trying to meddle with Mueller.\n\n\u201cI think the folks inside the White House have got to imagine that\u2019s more risky than it\u2019s worth,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cThey\u2019ll open themselves up to endless investigation and subpoena.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, partisans have provided some of the more dramatic predictions for how the midterms will shape the Mueller probe.\n\nMSNBC host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell said on his program last week that Democrats winning the House means \u201cDonald Trump is going to be more terrified than he has ever been in his life, and Robert Mueller is going to be instantly more empowered knowing that a Democratic House of Representatives will not ignore his report the way a Republican House of Representatives would try to and probably succeed in ignoring it.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s allies counter that Democrats should strap in for a fight each time they try to push for materials from Mueller that aren\u2019t supposed to be made public.\n\nUnder Justice Department regulations, Mueller\u2019s reports are required to be transmitted to Capitol Hill only if his supervisors reject a major decision. A final report from Mueller \u2014 detailing the people he has decided to prosecute and those whom he hasn\u2019t \u2014 must go up the DOJ chain of command, which would then face the question of whether to make it public or send it to Congress, where House Democrats seem certain to use their new powers and instantly release it.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s advisers have said the president will try to halt the special counsel\u2019s findings from reaching the public by insisting the materials are investigation-sensitive and in some cases subject to executive privilege. And after Mueller does finish his work, they say, the Trump appointees running Justice will put up a fight against Democratic subpoenas.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to turn over stuff to the House,\u201d said Joe diGenova, the informal legal adviser to Trump who nearly joined the president\u2019s team earlier this year. \u201cThey\u2019re going to litigate all the way to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\n", "NEWSOM will be next CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR -- FEINSTEIN prevails over DE LE\u00d3N -- Toss-up HOUSE races too close to call -- $1 BILLION TOPPED IN CALIFORNIA RACES -- STATE SUPERINTENDENT and INSURANCE COMMISSIONER races tight\n\nTHE BUZZ: Gavin Newsom is your next governor, Dianne Feinstein is still your senator and the top-dollar props went down. The toss-up House races remain too close to call, with current margins registering a D/R split, while most GOP incumbents held the lean-Republican seats. Here's what we have for you:\n\nTHE STATEWIDES\n\n-- We start with Newsom: His win may have been expected, but the first Dem-to-Dem governor handoff since Washington Bartlett is still an important moment. He immediately becomes one of the country\u2019s most prominent counterweights to President Donald Trump in the nation and cements his status a future presidential contender. Carla was on the scene in Los Angeles:\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n-- \u201c'The future belongs to California,' Newsom told a crowd of cheering supporters, elected officials and celebrities in Los Angeles, taking a defiant posture toward Trump\u2019s politics and governing style.\n\n-- Newsom\u2019s first major message as governor-elect of the nation\u2019s most populous state left no doubt that he intends to claim a national platform. In California circles, Newsom is already the focus of Democratic conversation as a potential future candidate for president.\n\n-- With his election, 'Gavin Newsom emerges tonight as a really important voice in the national conversation,' said Sean Clegg, a veteran Democratic political consultant and partner with San Francisco-based SCN Strategies, a political shop that advised both the new governor-elect and Sen. Kamala Harris.\u201d Read Carla Marinucci\u2019s story in POLITICO here.\n\n-- Dianne Feinstein vs. Kevin de Le\u00f3n: FEINSTEIN. The networks called the race as soon as polls closed for the incumbent, who never seemed at serious risk of succumbing to de Le\u00f3n\u2019s strategy of flanking her from the left. A state Democratic Party endorsement for de Le\u00f3n, the former state Senate leader, didn\u2019t end up meaning much.\n\n-- Ricardo Lara vs. Steve Poizner for insurance commissioner: LARA leads by 1.6 points. Sidelined Republicans and allies saw this race as a test of whether a no-party-preference candidate like former Republican Poizner could find a way forward for California conservatives.\n\n-- Tony Thurmond vs. Marshall Tuck for state superintendent: TUCK leads by 1.2 points. This proxy war was easily California\u2019s most expensive statewide race, pitting teachers unions and top Democrats against a set of wealthy education reformers aligned with charter schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE HOUSE RACES\n\n-- Unprecedented millions of dollars poured into California's congressional clashes, reflecting changing demographics and surging voter enthusiasm. Expansive voting laws mean we won't know some of these outcomes -- and thus the extent of Dems' House Majority -- for a while. But here's what we know as of 6 a.m. PST.\n\nThe toss-ups: too close to call.\n\n-- Jeff Denham vs. Josh Harder (CA-10): DENHAM (R) leads by 1.2\n\n-- Steve Knight vs. Katie Hill (CA-25) HILL (D) leads by 2.6\n\n-- Young Kim vs. Gil Cisneros (CA-39) KIM (R) leads by 2.8\n\n-- Katie Porter vs. Mimi Walters (CA-45) WALTERS (R) leads by 3.4\n\n-- Harley Rouda vs. Dana Rohrabacher (CA-48) ROUDA (D) leads by 1.4\n\n-- Diane Harkey vs. Mike Levin (CA-49) LEVIN (D) leads by 4.8\n\n-- Duncan Hunter vs. Ammar Campa-Najjar (CD-50): HUNTER leads by 8.4\n\nThe reaches: Republican incumbents sweep\n\n-- Jessica Morse vs. Tom McClintock (CA-04): McCLINTOCK\n\n-- David Valadao vs. TJ Cox (CA-21): VALADAO\n\n-- Andrew Janz vs. Devin Nunes (CA-22): NUNES\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE BIG PROPOSITIONS\n\n-- Prop. 6: DEFEATED. Gov. Jerry Brown, top Democrats and a deep-pocketed coalition of labor and business prevailed over Republican proponents who spent to qualify this measure -- but then largely abandoned it -- in hopes of boosting turnout.\n\n-- Prop. 8: DEFEATED. Opponents in the kidney dialysis industry broke fundraising records as they sought to beat back this union-driven push to limit profits at clinics.\n\n-- Prop. 10: DEFEATED. With California\u2019s housing affordability crisis looming over the election, voters decisively rejected this measure to repeal a state law that limits local rent control.\n\n-- Prop. C: PASSES. San Francisco's tax on big business to fund homelessness services fractured the tech industry, with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff going all in. Voters backed the measure overwhelmingly.\n\nTotal on the statewides: six passed, five failed (assuming Prop. 1 holds its lead and Prop. 3 doesn't surmount a sizable gap)\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE STATE LEGISLATIVE RACES\n\n--It was all about the supermajorities again this year: How big the Assembly\u2019s is, and whether Dems reclaim a two-thirds margin in the Senate. Where the key contest stand:\n\nSD-12: (Anna Caballero v Robert Poythress) Caballero (D) leads narrowly\n\nSD-14: (Andy Vidak v Melissa Hurtado): Hurtado (D) leads\n\nSD-34 (Janet Nguyen v Dem Tom Umberg): Nguyen (R) leads\n\nAD-16 (Catharine Baker v Rebecca Bauer-Kahan): Baker (R) leads\n\nAD-32 (Rudy Salas v Justin Mendes): Salas (D) leads\n\nAD-38 (Christy Smith v Dante Acosta) Acosta (R) leads narrowly\n\nAD-40 (Henry Nickel v James Ramos) Ramos (D) leads big\n\nAD-60 (Sabrina Cervantes v Bill Essayli) Essayli (R) leads narrowly\n\nAD-72 (Tyler Diep v Josh Lowenthal) Diep (R) leads big\n\nAD-77 (Brian Maienschein v Sunday Gover) Maienschein (R) leads big\n\n-- In the Dem-on-Dem realm, Obama-approved Buffy Wicks has a big lead over Bernie-backed Jovanka Beckles in the East Bay, and Susan Rubio is up on Mike Eng in L.A.\n\nBUENOS D\u00cdAS, Good WEDNESDAY morning.

That had Target Book publisher Darry Sragow warning about the corrupted initiative process:\n\n-- \u201cSpending almost as much money on a dozen ballot measure campaigns as all the candidate races combined suggests that we should be looking at alternative ways of setting public policy, especially on issues of concern to very narrow interests,\u201d Sragow said in a press release.

She's been fighting long for this. I mean this,\" he said. \"There was nothing sarcastic about it. It was really meant with very good intentions.\"\n\nTrump added that he had a \"very warm conversation\" with Pelosi about the midterms results, but he said they did not talk about Democrats' calls to impeach him.\n\n\"We didn't talk about impeaching,\" he said, adding that he doesn't understand why Democrats would want to impeach him or anyone else in his administration.\n\n\"When you ask about division, they're the ones that cause the division. They cause tremendous division,\" Trump said of Democrats.\n\n", "Candidates who \"worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well,\u201d President Donald Trump tweeted. \u201cThose that did not, say goodbye!\u201d | Jeff Roberson/AP photo white house Trump to candidates that rejected him: 'Say goodbye!'\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday that Republican winners in Tuesday's midterm elections were successful because they embraced him and his agenda, taunting those losers who distanced themselves from the White House to \"say goodbye!\"\n\n\u201cThose that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well,\u201d the president wrote in a tweet. \u201cThose that did not, say goodbye!\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile midterm elections have historically brought congressional losses for party of the sitting president, Trump loomed especially large over Tuesday\u2019s results. Members of both parties, as well as the president himself, painted the midterms as a referendum on Trump. Turnout for Tuesday's election was up sharply relative to past midterm races, which typically have lower voter participation than presidential elections.\n\nSome Republicans feared that Trump\u2019s decision to harp on immigration issues in the closing days of the campaign rather than on a booming economy could alienate swing voters in suburban districts. That fear, at least in part, appears to have been borne out in GOP-held districts across the country, where Republican incumbents in and around urban areas were unseated by Democratic challengers.\n\nBut while the GOP lost control of the House on Tuesday, the party is on track to strengthen its majority in the Senate. And Republicans won some of the marquee gubernatorial races that Trump campaigned hard for, including Ohio's and Florida's.\n\nIn the Senate, where Democrats were defending seats in multiple states Trump carried in 2016, candidates were much more likely to embrace the president. In North Dakota, West Virginia and Montana, Democratic incumbents Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Manchin and Jon Tester all campaigned on their independence from their party's leadership and their willingness to work with the president. Manchin won, but Heitkamp was crushed and Tester's race remained too close to call as of Wednesday morning.\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

GOP Rep. Dave Brat, a member of the arch-conservative House Freedom Caucus, was upset in his Richmond-area district while longshot candidate and Trump supporter Corey Stewart lost his bid to unseat Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.). Voters in Kansas picked Democrat Laura Kelly over Republican Kris Kobach, an ally of the president who closely aligned with many of his policies, for governor. Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker, a high profile GOP figure who ran for president in 2016, lost reelection despite the president\u2019s vocal support.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, Trump demanded \"proper credit\" for \"this great midterm election\" despite the GOP's losses in the House.\n\n\"To any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election, just remember two words - FAKE NEWS!\" he wrote. \u201cYesterday was such a very Big Win, and all under the pressure of a Nasty and Hostile Media!\u201d the president added in a second tweet.", "Even with an expanded Senate GOP majority led by Mitch McConnell, President Donald Trump is still bound to encounter obstacles as he works to embed conservatism in the judicial branch. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo White House GOP Senate will keep cranking out Trump judicial, Cabinet nominees White House officials and allies call retaining the upper chamber's power to confirm judges and Cabinet nominees a 'huge victory.\u2019\n\nPresident Donald Trump would have loved to see Republicans keep their grip on the House of Representatives in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections. But the GOP\u2019s successful defense of its Senate majority was a huge consolation prize.\n\nA friendly House majority without Senate control is of little use to a president. But the Senate alone has great value: It approves or rejects judicial nominations, which have played a crucial role in sustaining Trump\u2019s popularity with establishment conservatives and evangelical Christians. And it is where where a flurry of expected Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominations will be considered in the coming months.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAfter Tuesday night\u2019s electoral setback, the president and his team plan to stress his ability to install judges as he rallies support for the 2020 election, according to more than a half-dozen current and former Trump officials.\n\nSpeaking at the White House Tuesday night, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called the Democratic failure to win the Senate \u2014 which had generally been considered a long shot \u2014 a \u201chuge victory\u201d for Trump.\n\n\u201cIf anything there will be more of an appetite for judges and more of a focus on it without the House anymore,\u201d a White House official told POLITICO. \u201cIt will be one of the few affirmative things that could still be pushed.\u201d\n\n\"If the Democrats had acquired a majority in the Senate, they could have blocked every person President Trump nominated for federal judgeships,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a steadfast ally of the president, wrote in a Fox News op-ed last week, adding of judicial nominations: \u201cThis was the biggest achievement of Trump\u2019s first two years, and now it is likely guaranteed to continue.\u201d\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Their proposed replacements will all require Senate confirmation.\n\n\u201cYou now have the ability to push through many more of your nominees without some of the consternation on the Republican side,\u201d said Marc Short, former White House director of legislative affairs, pointing to moderate members like Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who voted against advancing Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court last month.\n\nTrump won\u2019t automatically get his way on new Cabinet or judicial picks, however. Senate Democrats will deploy every delay tactic to draw out nominations and force Trump to pull candidates who meet the stiffest resistance. And in the House, newly empowered Democratic chairmen will bombard the White House with subpoenas and document requests, tying up a thinly staffed White House counsel's office that has been central to ushering judicial picks through Congress to this point.\n\nSome Trump officials conceded that keeping the Senate is cold comfort in the wake of the Democrats\u2019 House takeover.\n\n\u201cIf you lose a chamber, you lose a chamber,\u201d said one current White House official. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of sugar coating of it.\u201d\n\nStill, a Republican Senate also offers a useful talking point for Trump, who stuck his neck out for several prominent GOP Senate candidates, and who has often been more critical of House leaders than Senate ones.\n\n\u201cRhetorically [Trump is] going to claim that adding seats in the Senate is a great moral victory and the American people saw that [House Speaker] Paul Ryan and the rest of the Republicans couldn\u2019t get something done and punished them for it,\u201d said one former White House official.\n\nKeeping the Senate and losing the House still allows Trump to keep \u201cadding to the judicial legacy that he is going to have,\u201d while simultaneously creating \u201ca foil\u201d in the form of House Democrats, added former White House press secretary Sean Spicer.\n\nMeanwhile, many Republicans expect the House to be consumed by partisan warfare, while the Senate will remain relatively effective.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see [Trump] talk about the difference of getting things done in the Senate, and further obstruction in the House,\u201d said a former White House official.\n\nTo capitalize on such differences, however, Trump will need to continue his record-setting appointment of judges who are ideologically aligned with his administration, and pre-approved by the Federalist Society. The conservative judicial group, under the leadership of Leonard Leo, has worked hand-in-hand with the White House to identify originalist judges and elevate them to lifetime appointments.\n\nThe group has already found remarkable success: the 15 judges confirmed by the Senate in mid-October brought Trump\u2019s overall tally of judicial appointments to 84 so far in his presidency. Former President Barack Obama had confirmed 11 appellate court nominees and 30 circuit court judges by the same point in his second year in office. One caveat to Trump\u2019s success is that a number of his appeals court nominees have added to courts that are already mostly conservative instead of shifting liberal courts to the right, a trend that the Wall Street Journal recently pointed out.\n\n\u201cUp until now, the White House has been concentrating very heavily on the appellate courts,\u201d Arthur Hellman, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh and expert on the federal judiciary, said in an interview.\n\nWith the Senate remaining under Republican control, Hellman said Trump is likely to \u201cgive more emphasis than they have been to filling district court seats,\u201d particularly if his use of executive action becomes more prolific and he wants resulting legal challenges \u201cto be heard by judges whom he appointed and would likely be sympathetic.\u201d\n\nIt's a strategy that could have a long-lasting effect.\n\n\u201cExecutive orders don\u2019t outlast the president, legislation can change, but these judgeships last a long time,\u201d said Carrie Severino, the chief counsel and policy director of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, adding that Trump\u2019s higher-court appointments have placated \u201ca lot of Never-Trumpers and conservatives who have had to admit, sometimes begrudgingly, that \u2018Wow, this has been a home run.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c[Trump] intuitively understands that evangelicals and some other conservative groups that might not necessarily be attracted to his populist message have been extremely attracted [to], and understand what nominating conservative judges has meant, or will mean, to the country going forward, well past his presidency,\u201d said another former White House official.\n\nBut even with an expanded Senate GOP majority, Trump is still bound to encounter obstacles as he works to embed conservatism in the judicial branch.\n\nSenate Democrats can make it tough for Trump to pack the courts by continuing to reject GOP unanimous consent requests that allow nominees to move forward to the floor. Brian Fallon, the former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who served as his communications director, recently criticized the New York Democrat for forging a deal with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to confirm more than a dozen district and appellate judges in exchange for the Senate recessing so that members could return home with more time to campaign for re-election, or to help Democratic candidates in other races.\n\nBut in the new Congress, Democrats expect Schumer, a student of Senate history and rules, to continue using McConnell\u2019s playbook from when he was minority leader to make life hell for the majority, using every delay tactic available to minimize the number of judges sailing through. Schumer\u2019s hope, according to those familiar with his thinking, is that McConnell and other Republican senators might become so frustrated that they\u2019ll agree to his demands, including pulling certain judicial nominees whom Democrats find particularly objectionable due to their inexperience or far-right views.\n\n\u201cChuck\u2019s a skilled tactician, and he knows how politically salient judicial [nominations] have become,\u201d said Alex Halpern Levy, former chief speechwriter to Schumer.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got one hand tied behind his back thanks to the foolhardy 2013 rules changes,\u201d he added, referring to a decision to allow judges to pass through via majority vote. \u201cBut he\u2019s not going to let McConnell steamroll him on confirmations.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats are expected to cause trouble as well, especially for the White House counsel\u2019s office, which has spearheaded judicial selections and vetting. Former White House counsel Don McGahn left his job in mid-October, with White House lawyer Emmet Flood taking over in the interim until Pat Cipollone likely comes on board full-time later this month. The remaining bare-bones staff is bracing for a barrage of document requests and congressional subpoenas.\n\n\u201cTime is finite and the amount of time that the White House counsel is going to have to spend answering subpoenas directly cut[s] into the amount of time that they can spend on nominations,\u201d said a former White House official.", "Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) predicted that the GOP efforts \"will accelerate\" in the waning days of the GOP-controlled Congress in part because so much of their probe had been put on hold until after the election. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Legal GOP running out of time to grill Russia investigators\n\nHouse Republicans who have rallied behind President Donald Trump's claims that the FBI attempted to railroad him in 2016 are suddenly racing a two-month clock to produce results before a Democratic takeover obliterates their year-long crusade.\n\nTrump's top allies in Congress have fueled a months-long probe into divisive claims that anti-Trump bias at senior levels of the FBI and Justice Department fueled the bureau's investigation of Russian ties to the Trump campaign. Their allegations, echoed and amplified by Trump himself, led multiple GOP-led committees to brawl with the intelligence community over access to sensitive documents and force senior Justice Department officials to appear for heavily politicized depositions.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDemocrats, though, call the efforts a sham meant to provide political cover to Trump as he fends off special counsel Robert Mueller's encroaching investigation -- and they've long signaled that they'd shutter the GOP effort in the next Congress.\n\nThat leaves Republicans still agitating to continue the probe with a two-month scramble to tick off a lengthy and increasingly contentious to-do list: they want to depose Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and former FBI Director James Comey. They've sought new testimony from a raft of former Obama administration Justice Department officials. So far, those interview requests have not been backed by subpoenas. But with time running short, Democrats anticipate Republicans will use their remaining power to try to force the issue.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), one of Trump's closest allies in Congress, predicted that the GOP efforts \"will accelerate\" in the waning days of the GOP-controlled Congress in part because so much of their probe had been put on hold until after the election. Meadows and other Trump backers have been urging the president to declassify and release sensitive documents connected to the FBI's Russia probe, which Trump has so far hesitated to produce. He also wants the leaders of the GOP probe to subpoena key witnesses who have so far refused to testify.\n\nOne complicating factor: The two GOP lawmakers in charge of the investigation \u2014 House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) \u2014 are both retiring in January, and they haven't always relished the conflict between the House and Justice Department. But Meadows and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who have fueled much of the investigation, appear unlikely to let up.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are already nervously eyeing House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, who has wielded his gavel to squeeze the intelligence community over its handling of the Russia probe as well. Nunes signaled in September that he intended to release 72 transcripts of interviews that the panel conducted in its own effort to piece together the Russian plot to interfere in the 2016 election. But so far those documents remain secret.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the committee, has long accused Nunes of working to undermine Mueller's investigation and has pledged to chart a different course if he becomes the committee's chairman.\n\n\"I can't wait to see what ridiculous shenanigans Nunes tries to pull before Schiff takes over as chairman in January,\" said Matt Miller, a former Justice Department spokesman, on Wednesday morning.\n\nIt's unclear whether any of the GOP-led panels intends to issue new findings, documents or reports before the Democratic takeover.\n\n", "DIVIDED CONGRESS -- Life gets easier for Senate GOP -- RECORD NUMBER OF WOMEN ELECTED -- 2020 starts now\n\nBy Nolan D.

Nearly 5.7 million people voted Tuesday in the governor's race, 49 percent of active registered voters in the state. In 2014 just 3.8 million voters came out to vote in the gubernatorial and midterm elections and 4.7 million voters came out in 2010 in New York State. This year's record midterm turnout is still less than, though approaching, the roughly 7 million people that vote in presidential years in New York state, between 60 and 70 percent of active registered voters. \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Brendan Cheney\n\nNY HELPS DELIVER DEM CONTROL OF HOUSE: The outcome proved beyond gratifying to New York Democrats who were demoralized in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s 2016 win. Many formed grassroots groups designed to ensure Democrats won back at least some part of Congress this year. Many more registered to vote. Since November 2016, the number of registered Democrats swelled by more than 114,000, while the number of registered Republicans dropped by more than 15,000. The end result: Not only does the state now have at least three more Democratic members of Congress, but it also now has 5.8 million enrolled active Democrats and 2.6 million Republicans. POLITICO\u2019s Laura Nahmias\n\nNEW YORK DEMS POISED FOR POWER IN WASHINGTON: The shift in power in Washington positions several of New York\u2019s long-serving Congress Members in place to take over the leadership of powerful House Committees. Rep. Nita Lowey, NY-17, is poised to become chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee; Rep. Jerrold Nadler, NY-10, will likely become chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, where he could oversee impeachment proceedings against the current president; Rep. Nydia Velazquez,NY-7, will likely become chairwoman of the House Small Business Committee; and Rep. Eliot Engel, NY-16, is poised to become chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n\nWHO\u2019S TAKING CREDIT: Swing Left, who says its volunteers knocked on 185,000 doors, made 34,000 phone calls on behalf of Max Rose and raised $120,000 for his race.\n\nMIKE BLOOMBERG claimed partial credit for Dems winning the House \u2014 he spent over $110 million in midterms, with $80 million focused largely on flipping the House \u2014 he said in a statement that came off embargo at 5 a.m.: \u201cBy winning the House, Democrats can now serve as a bulwark against a White House that has shown no respect for the rule of law \u2014 and no interest in bringing the country together. The Democrats\u2019 gains demonstrate that the American people want Congress to stand up to a reckless, divisive president \u2014 and to work across the aisle to tackle tough issues. Millions of Americans poured their hearts into the campaign to retake the House \u2014 and I was proud to be a part of the effort. We can do better in America today, and we must start now.\u201d\n\nWHAT ALBANY'S READING\n\nPOLITICO\u2019s Bill Mahoney: Democrats took control of the state Senate in a convincing fashion on Tuesday night, flipping as many as eight Republican seats and losing no members in a year in which they needed a net gain of just one seat. Democrats Monica Martinez, Jim Gaughran, Anna Kaplan and Kevin Thomas all seem to have flipped districts on Long Island, and Pete Harckham won a seat in Westchester. James Skoufis and Jen Metzger had modest leads in Hudson Valley seats that Democrats are confident will hold. And Andrew Gounardes had a roughly 1,000-vote lead over Sen. Marty Golden in Brooklyn that will likely make him a favorite in any recounts in the coming weeks.\n\nTHE END OF THE SIMCHA FELDER CAUCUS: Key Orthodox Pol Loses Power As NY State Senate Swings To Democrats \u2014 Jewish Daily Forward\n\nNYT Edit Board: \u201cA To-Do List for Democrats in Albany\u201d \u2014 \u201dAt the top of the list is moving to fix the subway, protect women\u2019s reproductive rights and pass other important legislation stymied by Republicans and others for too long.\u201d Read it here.\n\nA NIGHT OF HISTORIC FIRSTS: The victory also means a long-standing glass ceiling in New York has been shattered.

James has vowed to use her office to attack the administration of President Donald Trump and his Republican agenda \u2014 keeping up a tradition begun under Eric Schneiderman and continued by his interim successor, Barbara Underwood. During her victory speech at Brooklyn's Milk River, James vowed to \"work day and night\" to champion the \"ideals and dignity that make this the greatest state in the nation,\" blasting Trump's \"vitriol\" and \"hate.\" She pointed to the need for New York to lead on criminal justice reform as well as protect women's reproductive rights. POLITICO\u2019s Madina Toure and Gloria Pazmino\n\nABOUT THOSE HOUSE RACES:\n\nNY-11: MAX ROSE TOPPLES DAN DONOVAN: One of the night's biggest upsets came in New York\u2019s relatively conservative 11th Congressional District, which encompasses all of Staten Island and parts of conservative Southern Brooklyn. There, Democratic first-time candidate Max Rose, a 31-year-old Afghanistan War veteran and former health care executive, won an upset victory unseating the incumbent Republican Dan Donovan, 62, in a district where Democratic voters outnumber Republicans, but a majority of voters approve of the job Trump is doing.\n\nThe district voted for Obama in 2012, but went overwhelmingly for Trump in 2016. Polls showed the congressional race was tight \u2014 a recent New York Times/Siena poll showed Donovan leading Rose by 44-40, with 15 percent of voters undecided. Winning over those voters was seen as the key to winning for both candidates. But Rose also had a decisive fundraising advantage over Donovan \u2014 he raised $4.1 million to Donovan's $2.3 million \u2014 and a strong get-out-the-vote operation with volunteers from across the five boroughs eager to help in New York City\u2019s only competitive House race.\n\nNY-19: Incumbent Rep. John Faso, 66, faced a challenge from the Democrat Antonio Delgado, 41. The two campaigns raised more than $11.6 million and spent more than $10.4 million on an at-times nasty and personal battle in which Faso\u2019s campaign and the NRCC faced criticism for ads depicting the Harvard-educated Rhodes Scholar as a hoodie-wearing rapper. Delgado had made Faso\u2019s support for Trump\u2019s repeal of Obamacare a central issue in the campaign, which proved a winning strategy.\n\nNY-22: Still, while many House races across the country have been cast as proxy wars over President Trump, In New York\u2019s 22nd Congressional district, Tenney, 57, lost to Democratic State Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi, 39, in a district where Trump is still broadly popular. The contest became more of a referendum on the freshman congresswoman\u2019s own likability, than a fight over how voters felt about Donald Trump.\n\nDespite the fact that Trump won this district by 15.5 points, and Tenney\u2019s determination to align herself with the popular president, she had difficulty making inroads with her own voters. The Republican who held the seat before her, former Rep. Richard Hanna, endorsed Brindisi in the race , calling Tenney a \u201clousy representative\u201d who\u2019d done little except serve as a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for the president\u2019s policies.\n\nWhere the wave came up short: In the races of several first-time female candidates, who were challenging incumbent male Republicans: On Long Island, Liuba Grechen Shirley mounted a spirited challenge to long-time incumbent Rep. Pete King, and lost by 6.6 points. Tracey Mitrano lost to incumbent Tom Reed in New York\u2019s 23rd Congressional District, 55-45. And Dana Balter lost to incumbent Rep. John Katko in NY-24, 53-47.\n\nNY-2: \u201cThe 13-term Republican lawmaker [Pete King] beat Democrat Liuba Grechen Shirley by just six points, 52-46. \u2018This is a great victory for the people of Long Island,\u2019 said King, who represents the 2nd District, which includes Nassau and Suffolk counties. `It\u2019s a victory for those people who believe in supporting the police, who believed in rebuilding the military and who believe in destroying MS13 and going after ISIS and am Qaeda.\u2019 But Grechen Shirley made King work for that win . She raised nearly $924,000, nearly four times King\u2019s $238,000.\n\nAnd she made history in the process, convincing the Federal Elections Commission to allow her to use campaign funds to use pay for childcare.\u201d New York Post\u2019s Nolan Hicks\n\nA message from Airbnb: The big hotel industry and hosts facing off is nothing new -- and the reality is that we remain at a stalemate, with real New Yorkers\u2019 lives hanging in the balance.

I will represent everyone in the district with the best constituent services, and I will continue to support our president,\u2019 Collins said in an impromptu news conference following McMurray's concession. \u2018I will continue to do my job. All is good.\u2019 Collins \u2014 who was removed from his House committees by Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, after his indictment \u2014 now will have to contend with a Democratic majority in the House.

The Siena Research Institute participated in an unprecedented partnership with The Upshot this campaign season to complete 96 congressional polls, with results appearing in real-time on the New York Times website. The ambitious (and captivating) endeavor is part of the growing portfolio for the local polling outlet, which is overseen by Levy. Levy had worked with the New York Times in 2016 and 2017, and wanted to go \u2018big\u2019 with the 2018 congressional elections. The unique presentation is similar to what Levy can witness at his personal computer, where numbers change in front of his eyes. After his partners at The Upshot experienced this unique view, he said, \u2018they wanted to show the world.\u2019 The project also differs from a majority of other polls because of Siena\u2019s process for determining likely voters, which starts with a registration-based sample. These voters are then asked about their likelihood of voting, which contributes to the weighted sample they produce.\u201d Times Union\u2019s Dave Lombardo\n\n\u2014 Democrats' control of state Senate could mean overhaul of rent regulations \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Janaki Chadha and Sally Goldenberg: Democrats\u2019 victory in the state Senate Tuesday will loosen the real estate industry\u2019s grip over the historically Republican chamber, months before the state\u2019s controversial rent laws are set to expire in June. With the GOP losing control of the Senate, Democrats are poised to have a majority for the first time in more than 50 years, giving sought-after reforms to rent rules the best chance they have had since landlord-friendly changes were ushered in in the 1990s.\n\nThe state\u2019s rent laws are particularly important for New York City lawmakers, where nearly 1 million rent-stabilized apartments are viewed by affordable housing advocates and Democratic politicians as a vital protection against soaring housing prices across the city. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard a pretty resounding chorus from Democratic state Senators that rent is the top priority in Albany next year, and most state Senate and Assembly members know housing is going to be the biggest fight,\u201d said Jonathan Westin, executive director of left-leaning advocacy organization New York Communities for Change.

The development would span a neighboring, city-owned site to the north that the Economic Development Corporation is seeking to turn into a 1.5 million-square-foot mixed-use project, the sources said. The agency last year picked a team that includes developer TF Cornerstone and Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center to build light industrial office space, at least 1,000 new homes and a new school. The other property \u2014 known locally as the Plaxall site for the family that has owned it for decades \u2014 is also being eyed for a rezoning that would allow a substantial amount of new development. That proposal would establish a nearly 15-acre, mixed-use district to accommodate 4,995 new homes, 335,000 square feet of light industrial space and 328,000 square feet of retail, cultural and office space. Spokespeople for TF Cornerstone, Plaxall and Amazon declined to comment, as did an EDC spokeswoman.\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Sally Goldenberg\n\nYou can find the free version of Sally and Janaki\u2019s real estate newsletter here: http://politi.co/2a1DgJk\n\nTHE HOME TEAMS, BY HOWARD MEGDAL\n\nCollege basketball season began!

It was a crushing blue wave\u2014at least in Illinois.\n\nTHE BUZZ\n\nDemocrat J.B. Pritzker has been elected governor of Illinois in a race that will be remembered as a referendum on incumbent Bruce Rauner and his Republican Party. Pritzker, who self-funded his campaign to the tune of $171.5 million, won 54 percent to Rauner\u2019s 39 percent. The victory was the tip of a wave that helped lift Democrats to take control of the U.S. House \u2014 though in Illinois, that wave was tsunami-ish, crushing Republicans in races up and down the ticket. Democrats flipped two congressional districts their way, swept the state Assembly and took some GOP-controlled county board seats. House Speaker Mike Madigan picked up at least six Democrats \u2014giving his party a supermajority just in time for discussions on redistricting. We\u2019re saying \u201cat least six\u201d because one single, solitary vote separates candidates in the 51st District.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nLet\u2019s start with the governor\u2019s race. Polls weren\u2019t closed an hour when Rauner called Pritzker to concede the race. Pritzker and running mate Juliana Stratton took the stage at the Marriott Marquis by McCormick Place, and Pritzker thanked Rauner for his service. Both men were cordial and left the rhetoric of the campaign behind them.\n\nIn a lofty speech, Pritzker talked about the uphill battle to rebuild a damaged state. \u201cWho we are is how we overcome our biggest challenges,\u201d Pritzker told the cheering crowd. \u201cWe work to mend broken places. We light the journey from hill to hilltop and recognize that there is grace in the courage to rise.\u201d\n\nWith his election, Pritzker becomes the wealthiest politician in the country\u2014beating out President Donald Trump, according to Forbes.

The GOP increased its majority in the chamber. | Charlie Riedel/AP photo elections 7 takeaways from a wild midterm election The suburbs were brutal for Republicans.\n\nDriven by massive voter turnout, the 2018 midterm election was both a blue wave and a red wave. It just depended on which map you were looking at.\n\nDemocrats blazed a suburban trail to wrest control of the House from Republicans, easily winning the popular vote in a national rebuke of President Donald Trump that is likely to yield a gain of more than 30 seats.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd yet the party lost ground in the Senate, giving Trump and GOP leader Mitch McConnell more breathing room for the next two years \u2014 and possibly even longer. Democrats also fell short in some of the most sought-after gubernatorial races, including the biggest prize of the night in Florida.\n\nTurnout was off the charts for a midterm election: In the previous midterm, in 2014, fewer than 79 million voters cast ballots for the House of Representatives. As of early Wednesday morning, 97 million votes had been counted solely for Democratic and Republican candidates, according to The New York Times, with millions more left to be tallied.\n\nBut just because the waves ran in opposite directions on the two maps doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t driven by the same undertow. Democrats continued to draw increasing support from white college-educated voters who were once the core of the GOP. On the national House map, Democrats won white voters with a college degree by about 8 percentage points, according to the exit poll conducted for the National Election Pool \u2014 including white, college-educated women by roughly 20 points.\n\nRepublicans, however, continued to surge among the non-college-educated white voters who have powered the party in the Trump era. White voters without a college degree went for GOP candidates by nearly 25 points. (Democrats also won more than three nonwhite voters for every one who voted Republican.)\n\nIn some races, that was a trade Republicans were willing to make. Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson \u2014 the Democrats running for Florida governor and Senate, respectively \u2014 won Florida\u2019s urban and suburban counties, including around Jacksonville, which was once GOP territory. But both were swamped by strong Republican margins and turnout in rural and inland counties that drove former GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis\u2019 victory in the governor\u2019s race and Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s lead in the current vote count.\n\nHere are seven takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s Trump-powered midterms:\n\n1. Suburban Republicans were swept away.\n\nDemocrats won suburbs from the Eastern Seaboard all the way to Nevada. But they didn\u2019t just pick off the low-hanging fruit \u2014 the GOP members long seen to be vulnerable \u2014 they expanded into more challenging terrain near Dallas, Houston, Oklahoma City and Richmond.\n\nRepublicans like Barbara Comstock in Northern Virginia, Mike Coffman in suburban Denver, Kevin Yoder outside Kansas City and Erik Paulsen in the Twin Cities were easy pickings for Democrats. But few Democrats were as confident they could oust Reps. Steve Russell in Oklahoma, or Karen Handel in suburban Atlanta.\n\nDemocrats won both toss-up races in Virginia, beating Reps. Scott Taylor in the Tidewater area and Dave Brat around Richmond. They knocked off both suburban Texas members: John Culberson in Houston and Pete Sessions in Dallas. Incumbent Carlos Curbelo crashed and burned in South Florida. So did Randy Hultgren in outer Chicagoland.\n\nRepublicans kept only a handful of suburban seats, with Brian Fitzpatrick narrowly hanging on in Bucks County, Pa., and Troy Balderson winning a rerun of this year\u2019s special election near Columbus, Ohio.\n\nBut, for the most part, it was a suburban bloodbath.\n\n2. How big is the wave? Wait for California.\n\nFor almost two years, California was seen as the key to Democrats\u2019 quest for the House majority. Turns out, they didn\u2019t need it.\n\nThe party will likely have flipped roughly 30 House seats \u2014 it needed 23 to win control \u2014 without posting any gains in California at all. But Democrats seem likely to add to that total once California counts all its votes.\n\nHow many more seats will Democrats win? It could be awhile before we know for sure. Voters in California could postmark their ballots as late as Tuesday, and it will take weeks for all those votes to be tallied.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, Democratic candidates are leading in only three of the seven targeted California races. But late ballots in California tend to trend Democratic, so more could pull ahead in the coming days.\n\nThere\u2019s one specific Californian who will be watching the returns with intense interest: House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. Given the large number of Democratic candidates who won Tuesday night who have said they won\u2019t support Pelosi to be the next speaker, she can use all the votes she can get \u2014 especially from California, where she\u2019s more popular than she is nationally.\n\n3. Democrats may have lost the Senate until 2022.\n\nIf GOP leads in Arizona and Florida hold, Republicans will hold 54 Senate seats. That\u2019s three more seats than the GOP holds now, and it might be enough to insulate the party against Democratic attacks in the next election.\n\nThe 2018 map was awful for Democrats \u2014 10 incumbents running in states Trump carried in 2016, including five by double-digit margins \u2014 and while the 2020 map is better, there are few slam dunks for the party.\n\nFirst, Democrats will struggle to hold Alabama Sen. Doug Jones\u2019 seat. Jones, who won a special election last year against an extremely flawed GOP candidate, will have to choose whether to seek a full term in a state Trump carried with 62 percent of the vote in 2016.\n\nIf Democrats lose the Alabama seat, they\u2019ll need to pick up five seats to flip the chamber (six if they don\u2019t win the presidency). It\u2019s hard to find that many solid opportunities on the 2020 map. The only Republicans up for reelection in states Hillary Clinton won in 2016 are Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine. Democrats could also target Sens. David Perdue (R-Ga.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas) \u2014 but those are more difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Some races are still uncalled, but it appears Democrats failed to keep the Senate within arm\u2019s reach two years from now.\n\n4. Republicans held some big governorships.\n\nDemocrats flipped seven governorships on Tuesday: Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico and Wisconsin. The Wisconsin victory, ousting longtime nemesis Scott Walker, might have been the most satisfying for Democrats.\n\nBut there are a handful of close-but-no-cigar races where Republicans emerged ahead that will sting. At the top of the list: DeSantis\u2019 1-point victory over Gillum, who appeared to energize Florida Democrats and had a modest lead in most public polls. Democrats haven\u2019t won a governor\u2019s race in Florida since 1994.\n\nThe closely watched race in Georgia hasn\u2019t been called, and while Brian Kemp is ahead, Democrats hope his vote share falls under 50 percent, forcing a Dec. 4 runoff with Democrat Stacey Abrams. But even if Kemp fails to secure a majority, he\u2019d be the favorite in a head-to-head race with Abrams.\n\nRepublicans also held on in a couple of smaller states with outsized national implications \u2014 Iowa and New Hampshire \u2014 where a number of Democrats will soon be flocking to kick off their 2020 presidential campaigns.\n\n5. Democrats patched the Blue Wall, but it\u2019s still vulnerable.\n\nTwo years after Trump crashed through the Midwestern Blue Wall, Democrats made gains in a number of states that the now-president turned red. In Pennsylvania, the incumbent Democratic governor and senator were reelected easily, and Democrats won half of the state\u2019s 18 House seats, up from only five after the previous election.\n\nIn Michigan, Democrats won the governor\u2019s race, the incumbent senator was reelected and the party picked up a House seat (and a second seat is leaning their way, though it\u2019s too close to call as of Wednesday morning). In Iowa, Dems picked up two House seats, though they lost the governor\u2019s race. In Wisconsin, Walker went down, and Sen. Tammy Baldwin won reelection.\n\nBut none of this means these states will reject Trump in two years. In 2010, Republicans won governorships in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Iowa \u2014 and senators in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Illinois. Then-President Barack Obama still won them all in 2012.\n\nMoreover, while Democrats made gains in some states, Ohio and its 18 electoral votes still look challenging for the party. Incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown defeated a poorly funded Rep. Jim Renacci by a little more than 5 points on Tuesday, and Republicans held the governorship when former Sen. Mike DeWine defeated Democrat Richard Cordray.\n\n6. Women won in record numbers.\n\nA record number of women will serve in the next Congress.\n\nThe previous record of women serving in the House and Senate at one time \u2014 107 in the current Congress \u2014 was shattered Tuesday night. Some races are uncalled, but for the first time it\u2019s likely that more than 100 women will be serving in the House alone.\n\nMost of the increase in female members comes from Democrats. Eighteen of the 29 seats Democrats picked up Tuesday night were won by women, and more are likely to declared victors in the coming days.\n\nOne telling example: All 20 members of Pennsylvania\u2019s current congressional delegation are men. But the state elected four women to Congress on Tuesday.\n\nWomen also drove Democratic successes in other races. Trump is fond of saying, wrongly, that he carried the female vote in 2016, but the result was even more decisive this time around. Women tilted Democratic by nearly 20 points, and white women were split evenly between the parties, according to exit polls.\n\n7. Beto didn\u2019t win, but other Texas Democrats did.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz defeated Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke on Tuesday by a less than 3-point margin \u2014 a closer race than many expected, and closer than some thought was even possible.\n\nNo, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s army of dedicated voters inspired by his candidacy didn\u2019t overcome Texas\u2019 partisan lean. And, yes, he might have left some voters on the table by running hard to the left.\n\nBut there are reasons not to be too dismissive of his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, turnout spiked. As of Wednesday morning, 8.3 million votes had been tallied in the race. That\u2019s only slightly fewer than the just under 9 million votes in the 2016 presidential race, and close to double the 4.6 million in the previous Senate race in 2014.\n\nThat sharp increase may have helped other Democrats. Lizzie Fletcher beat Culberson in Houston, and Colin Allred unseated Sessions in Dallas. GOP Rep. Will Hurd leads his Democratic opponent in another battleground district by fewer than 700 votes.\n\nThere were also a number of Republican close shaves \u2014 seats that stayed red, but were much closer than expected. Seven-term Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, won by just 4 points, down from a 19-point win in 2016. Rep. Kenny Marchant, also seeking an eighth term, won by just 3 points, down from 17 points. Rep. John Carter, who won by 22 points in 2016, edged Democrat MJ Hegar \u2014 whose candidacy is best-known for viral campaign ads that highlighted her service as an Air Force combat pilot \u2014 by only 3 points.\n\n\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the winner of a special election held earlier this year in Ohio's 12th Congressional District. Rep. Troy Balderson (R-Ohio) defeated Democrat Danny O'Connor in that race.", "ELECTION RESULTS RUNDOWN \u2014 Big night for WOMEN \u2014 Local UPSETS \u2014 WARREN \u2018just getting started\u2019\n\nGOOD MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS.\n\nTHE ELECTION RESULTS RUNDOWN \u2014 It was a good night for women in Massachusetts. Lori Trahan carried the open 3rd District, Ayanna Pressley is the first woman of color elected to the state's congressional delegation, and on the state government level, Tram Nguyen took out one of Beacon Hill's staunchest conservatives and Becca Rausch upset another Republican lawmaker.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTHE STATEWIDE RACES ... Sen. Elizabeth Warren won another six-year term in the Senate with 60 percent of the vote. She easily carried the Boston suburbs and much of Western Mass. According to this handy map from WBUR, Warren took hits in the central part of the state, and in south coast towns like Attleboro, where GOP challenger Geoff Diehl focused much of his efforts.\n\n\"Our fight is not over until we have transformed our government,\" Warren said at the Massachusetts Democratic election night party in Boston. \"Tonight we send a message to the world: We\u2019re just getting started.\"\n\nNo word on whether that means she's just getting started in the Senate or on the 2020 campaign trail. But someone did shout out \"2020!\" during her victory speech.\n\nGov. Charlie Baker cruised to another term. Baker won about 67 percent of the vote, untouched by the blue wave that coasted across much of the U.S., while opponent Democrat Jay Gonzalez got 33 percent of the vote. Baker's tough spots were in Boston, Cambridge and Somerville, and a sprinkle of towns in Hampshire, Franklin and Berkshire counties.\n\nAttorney General Maura Healey won her reelection bid with 70 percent of the vote, and called the midterms \"a test of our values, of our democracy, of America.\"\n\nIN THE HOUSE ... Ayanna Pressley is officially the first person of color elected to the House from Massachusetts. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to wait our turn, we don\u2019t have to wait for change,\u201d she told the crowd in Boston, to thunderous applause. \"None of us ran to make history, we ran to make change. However, the historical significance of this evening is not lost on me.\"\n\nLori Trahan carried the 3rd District with 61 percent of the vote, meaning Rep. Niki Tsongas' seat will continue to be held by a woman. I'm waiting to see whether Trahan and Pressley support Nancy Pelosi for Speaker when they head down to D.C. for freshman orientation.\n\nRep. Bill Keating held his ground against GOP challenger Peter Tedeschi, winning 60 percent of the vote against Tedeschi's 40 percent.\n\nDemocrats flipped the House \u2014 meaning Rep. Richard Neal is poised to become House Ways and Means chair, and Rep. Jim McGovern is on track to be chairman of the Rules committee. I'll be listening for when Neal talks to reporters in Springfield about the election results today.\n\nThe fate of some candidates endorsed by Rep. Seth Moulton and his Serve America PAC hung in the air last night. His picks included 15 wins, seven losses and 10 races too close to call around midnight. Moulton won his own reelection bid. Next up: Organizing against Nancy Pelosi's bid for Speaker, probably.\n\nON BEACON HILL ... Tram Nguyen took out one of Beacon Hill\u2019s most conservative lawmakers, state Rep. Jim Lyons, with around 54 percent of the vote. The district includes parts of Andover, North Andover, Boxford and Tewksbury. Nguyen was counting on voters \u2014 many of them women \u2014 who had become more engaged in local politics after the 2016 election. Looks like that calculation was on the mark.\n\nBecca Rausch edged out GOP state Sen. Richard Ross to win the Norfolk, Bristol and Middlesex district. Fewer than 2,000 votes separated Rausch and Ross, according to a tweet from her campaign in the early morning hours. She declared victory around 1:30 a.m.\n\nTHE REPUBLICANS ... Support for down-ticket Republicans hovered around 30 percent in most races last night. Candidate for attorney general Jay McMahon got 30 percent, treasurer candidate Keiko Orrall got 28 percent, secretary of state hopeful Anthony Amore got 25 percent and candidate for auditor Helen Brady got 31 percent.\n\n3rd Congressional District Republican Rick Green performed slightly better with 34 percent, and GOP Senate candidate Geoff Diehl led the pack with 36 percent. These candidates were less eager to disavow Trump than Gov. Baker this season, and their totals roughly match up with Trump's Massachusetts approval rating, which is 35 percent.\n\nTHE BALLOT QUESTIONS ... Question 1, the nurse-patient staffing limits question, was defeated by 70 percent of voters. Question 2, the money in politics question, was approved by 71 percent of voters. Nearly 68 percent of voters said \"yes\" on Question 3 to uphold a transgender accommodations law passed in 2016.\n\nHave a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

A blue, anti-Trump wave.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNot only did Sen. Menendez survive by somewhere around 10 points despite Republican Bob Hugin spending $36 million from his own pocket against him,but Democrats took at least three of New Jersey\u2019s 5 GOP-held House seats \u2014 two open and one held by 10-year incumbent Leonard Lance. Democrats Mikie Sherrill, Jeff Van Drew and Tom Malinowski are all headed to Congress, while Republican Tom MacArthur clings to a narrow, too-close-to-call lead in a district Democrats didn\u2019t even try to compete in two years ago. This is the suburban anti-Trump backlash that\u2019s been building for the last two years.\n\nNew Jersey Republicans will have their smallest U.S. House delegation in a century \u2014 and keep in mind that this is with a map they drew back in 2011.\n\nSome Trump supporters may attempt to paint this as something other than a repudiation of the president. But, really, this was all about Trump and his policies \u2014 most notably the tax law and the Obamacare repeal attempt. Otherwise, Menendez likely would have been in serious trouble. Rodney Frelinghuysen probably wouldn\u2019t have retired and would have coasted to re-election like he always did. MacArthur would be assured reelection. And Lance would probably be thinking about how he could avoid another primary challenge from the right in 2020.\n\nOne thing does counter this narrative: Seth Grossman, the unabashed pro-Trump Republican candidate who shared bigoted posts on social media, appeared to lose to Van Drew by only about 6 points. But that\u2019s New Jersey\u2019s more rural House district, and he still lost.\n\nIn other news, please forgive what are bound to be many missing stories on municipal races. I filed this in the wee hours, so many of those stories hadn\u2019t been published online yet.\n\nWHERE\u2019S MURPHY? In Newark for an 11 a.m. press conference on the election results\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY \u2014 Assembly Dems\u2019 Gina Wilder\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cDonald Trump traveled all around the country, telling audiences to look at the ballots and imagine his name was on them. In this one, he got exactly right. That\u2019s exactly what we did. And that\u2019s exactly why we reelected Bob Menendez.\u201d \u2014 Gov. Phil Murphy, introducing the senaator at Menendez\u2019s victory party\n\nBONUS QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cThe trial got me coming here today. Coming here to support Sen.

Bob Menendez was reelected to a third full term Tuesday, despite New Jerseyans\u2019 deep dislike of him \u2014 thanks, largely, to voters\u2019 even greater disdain for President Donald Trump. Menendez\u2019s victory over Republican Bob Hugin averted a nightmare scenario for the Democratic Party, which, during the final weeks of the campaign, was forced to pump nearly $7 million into New Jersey \u2014 a deep-blue state they would normally be able to take for granted. The 64-year-old Menendez defeated Hugin, a former pharmaceutical executive, despite having survived a six-week federal corruption trial in late 2017 and a severe admonishment from the Senate Ethics Committee over allegations he traded official favors for gifts from his co-defendant, Florida eye doctor and convicted Medicare fraudster Salomon Melgen. Menendez \u2014 whom a source said Hugin would not concede to personally \u2014 addressed supporters at the W Hotel in Hoboken at about 10:30 p.m. He began his victory speech by condemning both Hugin and Trump without naming either of them. \u201cToday is a victory of hope over hate, for facts over fiction, for inclusion over division, for hard work over ripping people off. I\u2019m so proud that New Jerseyans rejected the politics of personal destruction and the false, negative, salacious ads,\u201d Menendez said, referring to ads Hugin aired that brought up 6-year-old unsubstantiated allegations that he solicited underaged prostitutes in the Dominican Republic. Read the report\n\n\u2014New Jersey Democrats pick up three House seats in major victories, by POLITICO\u2019s Ryan Hutchins and Matt Friedman: New Jersey Democrats picked up at least three House seats on Tuesday, expanding their advantage over Republicans to at least 10-2, as one other race remained too close to call. The blue wave, which had Democrats poised to take back the entire House next year, led to the ouster of Rep. Leonard Lance \u2014 a moderate Republican from Central Jersey\u2019s suburban 7th District, home to President Donald Trump's \"summer White House\" in Bedminster. In North Jersey's 11th Congressional District, former federal prosecutor Mikie Sherrill defeated Republican state Assemblyman Jay Webber, taking over the seat held by retiring Republican Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen. And in coastal South Jersey\u2019s 2nd District, conservative Democratic state Sen. Jeff Van Drew defeated a controversial Republican who didn\u2019t have the support of the state party. He\u2019ll take over for retiring Rep. Frank LoBiondo. But Rep. Tom MacArthur, a Republican who had staked his political career on a willingness to support President Donald Trump, was still looking for a win with some votes left to be counted.

The most expensive congressional election cycle in New Jersey history is over after blowing through $127 million, a figure that is sure to grow when final disclosures are made later this month. The former record, nearly $93 million, was set in 2000 when a previously unknown Democrat, Wall Street financier Jon Corzine, spent more than $60 million of his own money to win a Senate seat that he only held for five years before running for governor. But where spending in 2000 was dominated by one campaign \u2014 the Senate race accounted for 75 cents of every dollar spent \u2014 this year more than half the money has been spent in House districts, some of which in past years were sleepy campaigns with safe incumbents who spent most of their money helping candidates in other states win seats. Nationally, Democrats needed to win 23 Republican-held seats this year to take control of the House, and they decided early to focus on the kinds of upscale suburbs that dominate New Jersey because polls and special elections in 2017 had shown highly educated voters turning away from Republicans. That targeting and the GOP\u2019s rush to defend its turf produced a flood of money that inundated the airwaves with attack ads, gauzy biographies and warnings that opponents would imperil Medicare, health insurance, apple pie and The American Way.\u201d Read the report\n\nSTICK IT TO THE OFFICIALS WHO NEGLECTED THIS \u2014 \u201c'I voted' stickers: Didn't get one on Election Day?

And so did countless people I've seen on social media. I have sticker envy \u2014 and apparently I'm not alone. Some voters in Essex, Mercer, Ocean and Somerset counties also didn't get a sticker.

Laura Wooten, of Lawrence Township, still has a job at Princeton University checking student IDs at the dining hall. She will take the day off from that job this Election Day to serve as a poll worker for her 79th year. She hasn\u2019t missed an election since Franklin D. Roosevelt was president. This includes last year, when her brother died a day before Election Day and she was unable to get a ride to the polls. She walked to get there. \u2018Voting is very important.

The referendum, known as the Securing Our Children\u2019s Future Bond Act, passed 52 percent to 48 percent. The referendum was largely expected to pass, given that New Jerseyans have often supported major state borrowing initiatives, and a Stockton University poll released last week found 63 percent of likely voters supported the referendum.

Hopson was leading by a wide margin with 83,605 votes, followed by Youngkin with 76,597 votes. Gibbs finished third with 69,412 votes, and Hughes was fourth with 69,003. The tally did not include provisional ballots or all mail-in ballots.

McDonald: \u201cThe Fulop administration is backing off its planned relocation of the Katyn monument in an effort to halt an expected delay in a new payroll tax, according to an email obtained by The Jersey Journal. Mayor Steve Fulop sent council members an email on Tuesday asking them to introduce an ordinance Wednesday that would rescind its June 13 ordinance that authorized moving the monument from Exchange Place to York Street. Fulop and his council allies had previously decided to let voters decide via a Dec. 11 referendum whether to reverse the council's June 13 action, but the mayor told council members in his email he's worried that the same petition drive used to try to reverse the council's Katyn ordinance would be used to stop implementation of the payroll tax, a 1 percent business tax intended to help fund the local school district. The tax, which the council is expected to adopt by the end of the year, is opposed by business groups.\u201d Read the report\n\nIF NEWARK HAD EMPHASIZED HOBBY\u2019S DELI, IT WOULD HAVE WON \u2014 \u201cAmazon decision should be a beginning for Newark, not an end,\u201d by ROI-NJ\u2019s Tom Bergeron: \u201cIf you\u2019re splitting up HQ2 \u2014 which is the latest report from unnamed sources \u2014 why wouldn\u2019t you want to give Newark a piece? The pluses of Newark are still there: No other finalist would have such a generational-defining moment (does anyone think moving to Northern Virginia, New York City or Dallas \u2014 the supposed front-runners \u2014 will have any measurable social impact?); No other finalist has more prime space and over-the-top incentives the state surely would rework to fit Amazon\u2019s needs (in other words, tell us what you want.); No other finalist has such a combination of potential high-tech employees and low rents (how many are as affordable as Newark? And that\u2019s before incentives). No other finalist would be as perfect a location for a satellite regional hub (what with the company already employing more than 16,000 \u2014 a number that only figures to continue to increase). As long as the company is thinking about breaking HQ2 into two pieces, why not three or four or five? And at what point are they called what they really are: Regional satellite offices. Newark and state officials should keep trying to get even a small piece of the prize even after the big announcement. And we have no reason to think they won\u2019t do so.

The U.S. government is now split -- the House is Democratic, the Senate and White House are Republican. And with that comes a dynamic that TRUMP has not yet confronted: a chamber of Congress that is looking to destroy and defeat him.\n\nSUBPOENAS will be flying. Investigative hearings will happen on the regular. The news media will need to shift its focus. If the White House has an idea, it will almost always get shot down by the Democratic leadership. The Democratic House of Representatives will be looking to hold TRUMP\u2019S administration\u2019s feet to the fire, and is sure to drag his Cabinet to Capitol Hill multiple times each month, to answer a slew of questions about its behavior, past and present.

The POLITICO House map\n\nIF THE WHITE HOUSE WANTS A BORDER WALL? Better try to get it done in the lame duck this year. Eliminate birthright citizenship? Get ready for war with an extraordinarily progressive House. There is one game in town for Trump right now: Try to forge a relationship with the House Democratic majority that mostly ran in complete opposition to his agenda.\n\nIT IS TRUE THAT THE HOUSE is the more likely chamber to flip in the first midterm of a president. But, it is also the purest test of the president\u2019s popularity. Everyone is up for re-election. The entire country voted, and Democrats won. Easily.\n\nSOME OF THE STALWARTS OF THE HOUSE GOP majority went down. Peter Roskam in Illinois and John Culberson in Texas both were toppled. Republicans lost Steve Russell\u2019s deep red seat in Oklahoma. Dave Brat, who beat Eric Cantor in 2014, is a goner.\n\nTRUMP\u2019S HOUSE ENDORSEMENTS MEANT SQUAT. The following candidates received presidential endorsements but lost: The president was gleeful that Mark Sanford lost his primary to Katie Arrington, but his First District of South Carolina went to Joe Cunningham, the Democrat, who topped Arrington. Other Trump candidates got smacked. They include: Brat, Lena Epstein in Michigan, Claudia Tenney, John Faso and Dan Donovan in New York, Kevin Yoder in Kansas, Erik Paulsen in Minnesota and Danny Tarkanian in Nevada.\n\n\u2026 ROD BLUM of Iowa, John Chrin and Keith Rothfus of Pennsylvania, Pete Sessions in Texas, Jay Webber in New Jersey and Dave Hughes in Minnesota.\n\nTHE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR SPEAKER is NANCY PELOSI. After eight years in the minority, the California Democrat finally led her caucus back into power. She is the best organized, most viable candidate despite the fact that several incoming Democrats said on the campaign trail they won\u2019t vote for her. Only time will tell if any candidate stands up to run against her, but as of now, she\u2019s running unopposed. The final speaker race will be in January.\n\n-- HOUSE REPUBLICANS considering leadership bids will probably announce their intentions today. Candidates will want to announce their intentions quickly.\n\nCONSIDER THIS: Only four Democratic lawmakers who chaired a committee the last time Democrats controlled Congress remain in office: Collin Peterson of Minnesota, who chaired the Ag Committee; Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chaired Homeland Security; Nydia Velazquez of New York, who chaired Small Business; and Zoe Lofgren of California, who chaired Ethics.\n\nREPUBLICANS will have some adapting on their hands.

Expect a wave of House Republican retirements in the next four or so months.\n\nR.I.P. to the House Freedom Caucus. Their power goes to near zero in a Republican minority.\n\nIT WASN\u2019T ALL BAD NEWS FOR THE GOP. MITCH MCCONNELL had a very good night. The map was always favorable to Senate Republicans, but the GOP nearly ran the table last night, picking up at least four Democratic-held seats in North Dakota, Florida, Indiana and Missouri. Senate Republicans also headed off potentially embarrassing losses in Texas with Ted Cruz\u2019s victory over Beto O\u2019Rourke and Marsha Blackburn defeating Phil Bredesen.

Having fully bought into the narrative of Republican invincibility\u2014supported by boisterous crowds, a string of special election victories, and of course, his own supposedly unprecedented accomplishments and record-smashing poll numbers\u2014the president struggled to imagine a sweeping rebuke of his government. Sensing this, and playing to his ego, Stepien and senior White House officials encouraged Trump to mobilize Republicans by making the election all about him. \u2018Tell them that you\u2019re on the ballot,\u2019 Stepien urged.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- WAPO\u2019S MICHAEL SCHERER and JOSH DAWSEY: \u201cHow Democrats won the House\u201d: \u201cAt the White House, a number of senior aides had argued privately that Trump\u2019s focus on fanning fears over immigration went too far.

The Interior Department blamed the incident on \u2018suspicious\u2019 people who interrupted a home barbecue by lurking outside Zinke\u2019s home and yelling profanities about President Donald Trump \u2014 which neighbors said did not happen.\n\n\u201cBut a government ethics expert said it raised new questions about whether the secretary was using government resources for personal purposes. Neighbors said the incident began when they noticed a black Mercedes with New York license plates idling for several hours outside a residence Zinke has rented since he was a member of Congress. It is unclear why the Park Police, who are part of the Interior Department, were called to the home rather than the D.C.

But Schumer, the Senate minority leader, kept pushing: He wanted the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to blanket Missouri\u2019s airwaves with TV commercials.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMcCaskill prevailed, persuading Schumer to pump more than $6.5 million into the Missouri Democratic Party to give her turnout operation a dramatic boost, according to multiple people familiar with the conversations. It was the type of political cunning that the two-term senator had demonstrated in the past to win close Senate races.\n\nMcCaskill lost anyway.\n\nAcross the country, Democrats similarly out-raised their Republican opponents and built field operations that they hoped would weather a brutal Senate map that tilted heavily in Republicans\u2019 favor. But this time, it wasn\u2019t enough: Opponent Josh Hawley won by 6 points, exorcising the party\u2019s demons in Missouri, and probably three other Democratic incumbents went down alongside her despite battle-hardened campaigns and big financial advantages.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Republicans avoided the kind of devastating gaffes that boosted McCaskill and Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) in 2012, and unlike that year, there was no presidential campaign to boost Democratic turnout.\n\n\"This state drives me crazy,\u201d McCaskill said in her concession speech, \u201cbut I love every corner of it.\u201d\n\nAs Democrats captured the House on Tuesday, their hopes of retaking the Senate in 2020 drifted further away. McCaskill, Donnelly and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) all lost, and Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) appeared on his way to suffering the same fate, pending a recount. The party struggled mightily in Trump country and in states that were the cornerstones of the eight-year Democratic majority, from 2007 until 2015.\n\nThis story, based on interviews over the final months of the campaign with senators, candidates, congressional aides and political strategists, confirmed what became clear on election night: The suburbs may have gone for House Democrats, but the Senate map was so bad that sweeping Democratic enthusiasm did nothing to dent the Republican majority. In fact, its majority grew.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal investment in the Senate sealed the deal. He crisscrossed the country, hitting some states multiple times \u2014 all the while delivering sound bites that Republican hopefuls used to promote themselves and bash their opponents.\n\n\u201cWe have always felt like we\u2019re running with President Trump no matter what,\u201d said Chris Hansen, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cWe think he\u2019s a huge asset, to be clear. These rallies are not by mistake.\"\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a total rout for Republicans. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin survived in a state Trump carried by 42 points;Montana Sen. Jon Tester won narrowly; Rep. Jacky Rosen unseated Republican Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada; and the Arizona race remained too close to call Wednesday morning. Those bright spots, plus a newly rebuilt Midwestern blue wall, eased the sting somewhat for Democrats.\n\nIt could have been even worse. Democrats believed at least two of their incumbents would have retired if Hillary Clinton had won the election in 2016, rather than taking on an almost impossible reelection campaign, according to senators and aides. Instead, Democrats entered the 2018 cycle with all their incumbents running, so the GOP quickly set out to pick off the weakest of the herd.\n\nIt wasn't a straight shot, however. In some states, Republicans had to resolve their own thorny politics before they could zero in on Democrats.\n\nIn Indiana, for instance, Republicans knew they were staring at a long, nasty primary. GOP officials worried it would give Donnelly, one of the most vulnerable Democrats up for reelection, an easy year-and-a-half to prepare. Sure enough, GOP Reps. Todd Rokita and Luke Messer began tearing each other apart during the summer of 2017.\n\nSo the GOP set out to define Donnelly, a low-key presence during his first term in Washington. If there was one thing that distinguished Donnelly, it was his blue-collar appeal and attacks on outsourcing jobs. So when Donnelly was forced to sell stock in his brother's company following news reports that it produced products in Mexico, Republicans smelled opportunity.\n\nJohn Ashbrook, a GOP strategist and former aide to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, settled on the Trump-like nickname \u201cMexico Joe.\u201d It followed Donnelly everywhere: Republicans even hired a mariachi band to follow the Democrat to events.\n\nThe move put Donnelly on the defensive as the GOP\u2019s bloody primary played out. The low-key Donnelly ended up drawing a second unflattering sobriquet courtesy of Trump: \"Sleepin\u2019 Joe.\"\n\nHe lost by nearly 10 points on Tuesday night.\n\nSen. Joe Donnelly leaves the stage after answering questions during the final hour of voting in Indianapolis on Tuesday. | AP Photo/Michael Conroy\n\nThe intense focus on the most fertile states \u2014 Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota and Florida, and three GOP-controlled states, Tennessee, Arizona, and Nevada \u2014 wasn\u2019t an accident. McConnell and his lieutenants made the decision to fight on friendly territory and not try to shoot for a filibuster-proof majority, which was not beyond the realm of possibility two years ago.\n\nMcConnell had developed a mantra informed from his own history as a two-term NRSC chairman: Don\u2019t fall in love with the map. Trump had won 10 states where Democratic senators were now facing reelection, raising hopes that Republicans could pile up victories in those states and stirring fears among Democrats of spending money in the populous, pricey states of Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan.\n\nWhen spring 2018 came around, GOP groups were preparing to decide where to spend their money. When the time came to discuss publicly where the battle to control the Senate would be lost or won, McConnell looked straight past the Rust Belt that had put Trump over the top and focused on more inviting targets.\n\nRepublicans working on those races were incensed that McConnell was setting them adrift, and big GOP money never flowed in over the closing stretch even after the GOP sunk millions into ousting Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin. But it was a simple acknowledgment that no matter how good things appeared for Republicans, they simply couldn\u2019t win everywhere.\n\n\u201cMcConnell did something smart early on. It must have been hard to cut loose\u201d that many states that Trump won, said J.B. Poersch, who runs the Democratic outside group Senate Majority PAC. \u201cTo come to the table and say 'those states aren\u2019t a priority for us': That was pretty ballsy.\u201d\n\nRepublicans said the decision not to compete in pricey Midwestern states boosted their odds elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe saw data showing Trump\u2019s image in those states had waned significantly and his job approval was underwater in each of them,\u201d said Steven Law, president of the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund. \u201cThat didn\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nThe ceding of those four states provided a blue wall of sorts for Democrats. But the party still needed to capitalize on at least one of their pick-up opportunities to have any claim to success. And Sen. Dean Heller\u2019s rocky relationship with Trump opened the door.\n\nHeller (R-Nev.) didn\u2019t endorse Trump in the presidential race and fought the GOP\u2019s efforts to repeal Obamacare in the spring of 2017, famously holding a press conference alongside GOP Gov. Brian Sandoval to pan the Senate GOP\u2019s health care bill. The move drew the ire of Trump, who mused about whether Heller \u201cwants to remain a senator.\u201d\n\nThe Nevada Republican quickly moved back toward Trump. He vocally embraced Obamacare repeal, which helped head off a primary challenge. But Heller\u2019s pro-Trump turn gave Democrats plenty of ammunition, and Heller, who also faced the Democratic apparatus assembled by retired Democratic Leader Harry Reid, was trounced.\n\n\u201cHe sold his soul to avoid a primary,\u201d said a senior Democrat working on Senate races. \u201cIt hurt him with independents. That\u2019s the game that matters.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Manchin and Tester were the only seriously endangered incumbents from either party to win reelection. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) was trailing at the end of the night but did not concede the race, which is headed to a recount.\n\nTester's close race was indicative of the treacherous electoral terrain Democrats had to navigate. Though well liked in his state, Tester knew his reelection would be a slog, given the conservative bent of Montana. Republicans failed to get their top recruits, ending up with state auditor and insurance commissioner Matt Rosendale, a developer with a Maryland accent and a less-than-ideal candidate.\n\nYet Republicans still saw Tester as beatable. He had ticked off the president by derailing his Veterans Affairs nominee Ronny Jackson, and the president was eager for revenge. But no GOP groups had fully committed to beating Tester.\n\nIn early September, leaders from the Club for Growth, Senate Leadership Fund, the Chamber of Commerce and the pro-Trump America First PAC convened to sketch out a plan to spend money on behalf of Rosendale. Club for Growth President David McIntosh had helped boost the conservative nominee through the primary, and he told leaders of the other outside groups that they needed to engage.\n\nEach group picked a week or two to spend money against Tester down the stretch, but no group went all in against him. \u201cThis was a significant investment that could be less than a sure thing, so let\u2019s share the risk,\u201d said Law of the Senate Leadership Fund.\n\nIt wasn't enough, and Tester escaped with a narrow victory, a rare bright spot for his party.", "In the middle of September, White House political director Bill Stepien sat down in the presidential residence across from Donald Trump and delivered a wake-up call. Polling showed that Democratic voters were highly motivated ahead of the midterm elections, Stepien explained, while Republican voters were not\u2014and Trump was feeding the complacency of his base by downplaying the threat in November. \u201cMr. President,\u201d Stepien told him, according to sources familiar with the conversation, \u201cPlease stop saying \u2018Red Wave.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump was perplexed. Having fully bought into the narrative of Republican invincibility\u2014supported by boisterous crowds, a string of special election victories, and of course, his own supposedly unprecedented accomplishments and record-smashing poll numbers\u2014the president struggled to imagine a sweeping rebuke of his government. Sensing this, and playing to his ego, Stepien and senior White House officials encouraged Trump to mobilize Republicans by making the election all about him. \u201cTell them that you\u2019re on the ballot,\u201d Stepien urged.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe president did just that. \u201cGet out in 2018,\u201d he said at a Missouri rally in late September, debuting a more urgent midterm message, \u201cbecause you are voting for me in 2018.\u201d If Trump was happy to embrace the midterm elections as a referendum on his job performance, he can only be halfway pleased with the results: Democrats swept back into partial power on Tuesday, seizing control of the House of Representatives in a historically high-turnout affair that served as an emphatic scolding of the administration and its policies.\n\nAs of 10 a.m. Wednesday morning, Democrats had won back 28 seats, and were projected to win at least a handful more\u2014putting them in control of powerful, subpoena-wielding House committees, with the authority to create all kinds of trouble for the White House.\n\nIn a sign of the markedly different terrain on which the battles for the two chambers were waged, Republicans not only held the Senate but expanded on their majority. Taking advantage of perhaps the most-Republican friendly map in a century, the White House celebrated knocking off numerous Democratic senators, including Bill Nelson of Florida, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, ensuring a sturdier Senate majority for the next two years.\n\nBut the nation\u2019s attention was focused squarely on the House. This account\u2014drawn from dozens of interviews over the past year with Republican and Democrat candidates, strategists, activists and voters\u2014places Tuesday\u2019s verdict in the context of the country\u2019s deepening polarization and its most volatile midterm election cycle in recent memory. After two years of rollercoaster news cycles driven by a president who thrives on turmoil and governs with a showman\u2019s attention to shiny objects, Democrats stormed back into the House majority by following a simple rule: Don\u2019t take the president\u2019s bait.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/2141/1155968404_5858584191001_5858574182001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nVoter participation was high across ideological and demographic lines, with both parties effectively nationalizing local and statewide races. But whereas Trump sought to make the election all about himself, Democratic candidates were remarkably disciplined in focusing the electorate\u2019s energy on the alleged failures of his party: Republican tax reform that exploded the deficit and disproportionately benefited the wealthy; Republican efforts to take away health care access from millions of people; and Republican politicians whose acquiescence to Trump deepened the country\u2019s partisan divide and further diminished its faith in government.\n\nWinning the House represented the culmination of a master plan that was simple and straightforward. With Trump and his fellow Republicans expecting a full-frontal assault on the president himself, leading Democrats\u2014from House leader Nancy Pelosi, to Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, to the party\u2019s biggest donors and elder statesmen\u2014advised House candidates to run hyper-local, non-hysterical campaigns that made little mention of the president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not running against Donald Trump. I\u2019m running against Erik Paulsen,\u201d Dean Phillips, the newly elected Democratic representative from Minnesota\u2019s 3rd District, told POLITICO while campaigning two days before the election. \u201cI talk about what people want to talk about, and it\u2019s much less about Trump than you\u2019d think.\u201d Paulsen, who lost by just over 11 percentage points, represents a suburban Twin Cities district that Republicans have controlled since 1960. He tried repeatedly to distance himself from Trump\u2014whose approval rating in the 3rd District tumbled into the 30s this fall\u2014but it was little use: Phillips branded him as a rubber-stamp for the White House, while the president himself was so irritated by Paulsen\u2019s lack of loyalty that he insisted on sending not one but two tweets endorsing him.\n\nPaulsen, still message-disciplined in mid-October, told POLITICO then: \u201cI\u2019ve got a good brand of bipartisanship and that\u2019s what Minnesotans really like. It\u2019s a salient point to make for those who may not be enamored of Trump.\u201d On Tuesday, that rang hollow.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the only place where a GOP incumbent wilted in the Trump\u2019s shadow. The midterm elections resulted in a wipeout of numerous moderate Republicans\u2014including Mike Coffman of Colorado, Barbara Comstock of Virginia, Peter Roskam of Illinois and Carlos Curbelo of Florida, among many others\u2014whose individual brands in their metropolitan districts were not sufficient to overcome the president\u2019s devastating unpopularity.\n\n\u201cRepublicans have lost the suburbs. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve lost them forever, but we\u2019ve definitely lost them for now,\u201d said Liesl Hickey, who served as executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2014. \u201cThe suburbs wanted to send a message to the president and they have.\u201d\n\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

New York GOP incumbents John Faso of the 19th District and Claudia Tenney of the 22nd District\u2014both of whom benefited enormously from Trump\u2019s approval ratings in the Hudson Valley\u2014both lost their reelection bids. Democrat Max Rose brought his brash brand to Staten Island, and toppled Rep. Dan Donovan in a district Trump won by 9 points. Incumbent GOP Rep. Steve Russell suffered a stunning upset in Oklahoma, while a pair of Republican nominees vying for open seats in pro-Trump districts, Katie Arrington and South Carolina and Danny Tarkanian in Nevada, both fell short.\n\nThe broadest category of GOP losers on Tuesday was comprised of those incumbents representing conservative areas of the country where Trump\u2019s standing was not determinative either way\u2013and who only have themselves, and their lackluster campaigns, to blame. After nearly a decade in the majority, and enjoying the fruits of favorably drawn districts, incumbents such as John Culberson of Texas and Leonard Lance of New Jersey lacked the muscle memory to run effectively in a difficult environment.\n\nOn the other hand, Rep. Kevin Yoder of Kansas ran the best campaign of his career\u2014and still lost on Tuesday.\n\nThe moderate Republican, hailing from the Kansas City suburbs, knew he had to thread his race through a needle-sized hole, made smaller every day by Trump. Hillary Clinton won the seat in 2016, and polling showed mixed messaging on how to address the president. An April 2018 poll showed that \u201cundecided\u201d voters wanted Yoder to stand with Trump, while \u201cpersuadable\u201d voters wanted him to distance himself from the president\u2014both groups he needed to win over to succeed. Still, a brutal Democratic primary left his eventual opponent, Sharice Davids, marred by her on-the-record support for abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. (She walked that comment back.) He also outraised her\u2014a feat that dozens of his colleagues failed to match. But it was clear by Labor Day that it wouldn\u2019t be enough.\n\nBrimming with frustration one Sunday in September, Yoder placed a phone call to Steve Stivers, chairman of the NRCC. Word had leaked that his group, the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm, planned to cut $1.2 million in TV spending that would have buoyed him in the suburban district. But the committee had a poll showing Yoder trailed Davids by high single-digits and suddenly pulled the rug out from under him. Yoder learned of the development from press reports, not the committee. \u201cWhen people ask me what I think of you, I can\u2019t decide whether to tell them you\u2019re a fucking idiot or a fucking liar,\u201d Yoder growled at Stivers. \u201cBut now I think you\u2019re both.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nHouse Republicans returned to Washington in January 2018 with a transformed outlook on the midterm elections. Much of Trump\u2019s first year in office had been calamitous, as a combination of failed policy initiatives and presidential misadventures rendered the GOP deeply unpopular across the country. But then things perked up: Under intense pressure from party leaders and top donors, Republicans in both chambers rallied behind a tax-reform bill that Trump signed into law just before Christmas. Few GOP lawmakers seemed thrilled about the particulars, but at least they had something to show, legislatively speaking, for their unified control of the government. \u201cNow,\u201d Speaker Paul Ryan told his members when Congress reconvened in January, \u201cwe have something to run on.\u201d\n\nThe president had other ideas. Even as a steady drip of positive reviews met the Republican tax plan\u2014companies giving bonuses, small businesses hiring\u2014Trump seemed disinterested in selling the product. Whether it was boasting about the size of his nuclear detonation button, calling himself \u201ca very stable genius,\u201d launching ad hominem assaults on prominent Democrats, railing against the special counsel\u2019s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, or saying he would \u201clove to see a shutdown,\u201d Trump spent the opening months of 2018 taking seemingly every opportunity not to focus the nation\u2019s attention on his party\u2019s prize legislation.\n\nThis was much to the annoyance of Republicans on Capitol Hill, chiefly Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Though McConnell\u2019s chamber was less endangered in 2018 than Ryan\u2019s, both men privately warned Trump that their majorities were at risk\u2014and urged him to stay on message. But often this was beyond the president\u2019s control: The Wall Street Journal reported in January that Trump had paid hush money to adult film actress Stormy Daniels to cover up an affair; in February, 17 people were shot to death at a Florida high school, sparking a passionate national dialogue about gun violence; the next month, Gary Cohn resigned as Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, the latest in an exodus of top White House aides.\n\nRepublicans already knew they would be running uphill in 2018. The first sign of real trouble came in June of the previous year in Georgia\u2019s 6th District, a bloody red Republican stronghold made vacant by Tom Price\u2019s appointment to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. What should have been a snoozer turn into a slog\u2014the most expensive race in congressional history. The parties, candidates and allied outside groups combined to dump some $55 million into the suburban Atlanta district. Republicans had fought off Democratic challenges in prior special elections that were too close for comfort, but this was different: The surge of enthusiasm around a previously anonymous challenger named Jon Ossoff, and the GOP panic\u2014dropping $18 million to hold a district Trump had carried by 23 points\u2014signaled that Democrats could compete anywhere and everywhere.\n\n\u201cThey spent all of that money early on,\u201d said Kelly, who ran the House Democratic super PAC. \u201cThose were away games for us, and Republicans felt they had to win them.\u201d\n\nThe GOP held on, defeating Ossoff by three points. Yet the victory was costly\u2014and not just because of the price tag. \u201cWe won the battle, but it might have cost us the war,\u201d said Corry Bliss, whose Republican-allied super PAC, the Congressional Leadership Fund, spent $6 million in the district. \u201cWe made Pelosi the issue in that race, and that\u2019s when Democrats adapted and began running away from her.\u201d As far as the money spent, Bliss added, \u201cWe had no choice. It was an investment in narrative. If we lost in Georgia, there would have been even more Republican retirements.\u201d\n\nIt also presaged the avalanche of money heading toward Democratic candidates. That spring, Keenan Pontoni, who managed Ossoff\u2019s race, would pull open his laptop around midnight most evenings and stare at the numbers rolling in from Act Blue. At first, $100,000 became the norm raised every day, then $200,000.\n\nDemocrats were destined to play offense in the battle for the House, but the GOP\u2019s defense crumbled with a rash of retirements. Of the 44 districts left open by Republican incumbents who retired, resigned or sought higher office, Democrats targeted half of them. Recent history explains why: In the last six midterm cycles, the president\u2019s party hasn\u2019t retained a single open seat he failed to carry two years prior, according to a Cook Political Report analysis. The vacancies ranged from once-safe red districts that turned competitive under Trump to seats that Hillary Clinton won in 2016, like Washington\u2019s 8th District that stretches from downtown Seattle into rolling farmland.\n\n\u201cIt may have been the final nail in our coffin,\u201d said Brian Walsh, a Republican consultant who leads the pro-Trump outside group, America First.\n\nThe most notable Republican to call it quits was Ryan, who announced in April that he was leaving Congress at year\u2019s end. The decision to stay as a lame-duck speaker roiled some individuals in the party and uncorked a gusher of internal gossip. Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, felt exposed by the decision, believing that his best chance to succeed Ryan in the next Congress was to have a running start. Sensing the same thing, allies of Steve Scalise began whispering about McCarthy\u2019s vulnerabilities in the conference and suggesting a stealth campaign for the speakership. The tension between all three leadership officials, and between their staffs, was the talk of Capitol Hill as spring turned to summer, especially as McCarthy and Scalise jockeyed not-so-subtly to find ground on the other mans\u2019 right flank (McCarthy aired radio ads nationwide this fall promoting his build-the-border-wall legislation, vexing local Republicans in tough races who hoped for a shout-out from the majority leader in his ads). Even Republicans loyal to Ryan wondered whether he was hurting the party by sticking around.\n\nUltimately, those concerns were unfounded\u2014Ryan raised a record-breaking $200 million for the party since becoming speaker\u2014though his untimely departure accentuated the narrative of Republicans waving the white flag in 2018. Although he regretted contributing to that perception, Ryan felt liberated, joking with friends that he was glad to be off that ballot with Trump looming larger over the elections. \u201cThere are a few folks that I tried to talk [convince] to stay in that didn\u2019t stay in,\u201d Stivers, the NRCC chairman, told POLITICO in late August. \u201cWe have more retirements than I would have liked, but we have great recruits.\u201d So did the Democrats\u2014and more of them.\n\n\n\n***\n\nInside a gymnasium at Lansing Community College, less than a week before Election Day, Elissa Slotkin stepped to the stage and made a proud declaration: \u201cI am a Midwestern Democrat.\u201d\n\nInspired by House Republicans\u2019 vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act\u2014and the implications for her mother, a cancer survivor with preexisting conditions\u2014Slotkin ran for Congress not as a partisan warrior but as a pragmatic moderate. Taking on Mike Bishop in Michigan\u2019s 8th District, a gerrymandered lot stretching from Lansing to Metro Detroit, Slotkin mastered the art of rhetorical triangulation: rejecting the GOP as too extreme while denouncing the leftward drift of her own party. With her \u201cMidwestern Democrat\u201d pitch, Slotkin, a former CIA analyst, showed the political chops of a savvy veteran instead of a rookie candidate. The race came to embody the battle for the House: a talented Democratic recruit with no opposition research to overcome, taking on a GOP incumbent with mediocre fundraising and no experience running a tough campaign.\n\nSlotkin defeated Bishop on Tuesday, winning by a few thousand votes in one of the country\u2019s tightest races. Her triumph reflected the depth of the Democratic recruiting class\u2014and the emphasis on promoting first-time female candidates.\n\nGalvanized by Trump\u2019s presidency, Democrats nominated a historically diverse slate of candidates. At least 133 people of color, and 158 first-time candidates, won primaries in 2018. Many won again Tuesday, promising to radically alter the composition of the 116th Congress. That diverse incoming class will include the likes of Colin Allred, an African-American former pro football player who scored an upset victory over Texas Rep. Pete Sessions in the state\u2019s 32nd District, and also Antonio Delgado in New York, a Harvard graduate and Rhodes scholar who was bizarrely portrayed as a \u201crapper\u201d in racially charged Republican ads. But women were the engine driving the Democratic takeover. The party put forward 180 female candidates on House general election ballots\u2014shattering the Democrats\u2019 previous record of 120, according to Rutgers\u2019 Center for American Women and Politics.\n\nOne of them, Abigail Spanberger, is heading to Congress next year after defeating Republican Dave Brat in Virginia\u2019s 7th District. She reached rockstar status the weekend before her victory, greeted by \u201cGo Abby\u201d chants in the sanctuary at St. Paul\u2019s Baptist Church last Sunday. She couldn\u2019t walk more than a few feet without being asked to take a selfie with fans. Her \u201cmoment of hyper-clarity\u201d in the race came during a mid-October debate when, after Brat mentioned Pelosi for the two-dozenth time, she responded: \u201cAbigail Spanberger is my name.\u201d Afterward, she thought, \u201cI hope that didn\u2019t sound dumb.\u201d But her one-liner was met with cheers, both at the debate and online. Late-night host James Corden tweeted the \u201cNow This\u201d video of her remark, which has 2.5 million views and counting.\n\nSpanberger, like Slotkin, is a former employee of the CIA\u2014and like Slotkin has said she won\u2019t vote for Pelosi as speaker. As the debate intensifies inside the Democratic Party over how to defeat Trump\u2019s GOP\u2014persuading the middle or mobilizing the base\u2014Tuesday\u2019s recapturing of the House highlights the importance of smartly tailored campaigns that engage the center of the electorate. \u201cYou have to back to the days of Dick Gephardt and Dave Obey to find this many Democrats of this substance, of this talent, running in these districts,\u201d said Kelly. \u201cPartisanship is changing. These candidates approached their districts in different, nuanced ways, and the party let them run their own races.\u201d\n\nBliss, whose super PAC tried to strangle these Democratic recruits in the crib, tipped his cap to the fresh faces of the opposition. \u201cIn this environment, if you\u2019re allowed to be a nonpartisan, apolitical outsider, you\u2019re going to win \u2013 period, end of discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a Ph.D. in political science to know they're going to win. And we knew that.\u201d\n\nThe groundswell in Democratic enthusiasm did more than produce talented candidates\u2014it yielded unprecedented sums of money in a midterm election.\n\nAfter years of Republicans outraising Democrats in midterm elections and down-ballot races, the tables turned in startling fashion in 2018: Not only did Democratic candidates outraise their GOP counterparts on the whole, but Democratic challengers consistently outraised GOP incumbents by wide margins. This financial advantage snowballed as the election cycle progressed, to the point where Republicans had gallows-humor conversations about a \u201cgreen wave\u201d instead of a red one. According to media-buying data, as of early October, the total spending of Democratic House candidates was increasing by some $2 million every day\u2014compared to $200,000 for the aggregate of House Republican candidates.\n\n\u201cLuke Skywalker defeated the Death Star not by building his own Death Star, but with one little X-wing plane, because they didn\u2019t view it as a threat,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist and former DCCC spokesman. \u201cThat\u2019s what Dem have done this cycle with small-dollar donors. We\u2019ve combatted the death star of Republican outside money with a series of X-wings donating $25 at time.\u201d\n\nBut there was plenty of big money, too. House Majority PAC and Patriot Majority, the main Democratic fundraising vehicles, unloaded a combined $113 million on House races. The Hub Project channeled more than $30 million into a smattering of state and local groups, focused on pushing a progressive message on health care and taxes. Another $45 million came from a constellation of outside groups, Giffords PAC, founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords; VoteVets, a progressive group working to elect veterans; The League of Conservation Voters, a pro-environmental group.\n\nA much-anticipated entrant into the cash dash was former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Having given $60 million in 2016 to both parties, Bloomberg, disturbed by continued gun violence and the family separation policy this summer, boosted only Democrats in 2018. Between House and Senate investments, his spending ballooned to $110 million. This deluge wasn\u2019t just felt in the districts that Democrats won, but in those Republicans held onto. With a rapidly expanding map and finite resources, the GOP was forced to make triage its incumbents\u2014often investing in one district at the expense of another. \u201cThey had fuck-you money,\u201d said Bliss, the Republican super PAC chief. \u201cThey could take a risk and throw cash around at seats they know they don\u2019t have a good chance of winning, just to make us spend there.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nMoney was a sensitive subject for Republicans down the home stretch of 2018.\n\nAt the conclusion of Labor Day weekend, the NRCC blasted out a memo to official Washington declaring, \u201cRepublicans are well-positioned to maintain control of the House.\u201d Beyond hyping the party\u2019s \u201cstrong\u201d recruits and \u201cresilient\u201d incumbents, the committee\u2019s optimism boiled down to one line: \u201cThe Cavalry is Coming.\u201d House Republicans had grown increasingly nervous about the cash deficit in their campaigns nationwide, and the party apparatus was promising that help was on the way.\n\nIt never arrived\u2014and \u201cThe Cavalry is Coming\u201d has become a punchline inside the GOP.\n\nHolding the House majority in such a toxic political environment was never going to be easy. And with the parties themselves continually weakened by outside money, it\u2019s difficult to assess the NRCC\u2019s fundraising prowess in full and fair context. That said, Republican critics say the committee\u2019s strategy for spending the money it had\u2014more than $100 million for the cycle\u2014was irresponsible bordering on reckless.\n\nThe biggest recipient of NRCC money in 2018 was Virginia Rep. Barbara Comstock, whose suburban Washington, D.C. district Trump lost by 10 points. A well-liked party insider, Comstock and her allies spent much of 2018 perpetuating the myth that she could buck the political and demographic trends in her district\u2014that her brand was strong enough to survive a potential blue wave. But the public polling never backed this up: Comstock consistently trailed her challenger, Jennifer Wexton, by double digits. That didn\u2019t stop the NRCC from pumping a total of more than $5 million into her race, all the way through October, even as everyone in D.C. knew the campaign was over. Wexton wound up winning by 12 points.\n\nAt the same time, the NRCC also invested heavily in Colorado\u2019s 6th District, where incumbent Republican Mike Coffman\u2014another favorite of the GOP establishment\u2014was a dead man walking. Public and private polling, as well as focus groups commissioned by GOP-allied organizations, showed that Coffman had no chance to win, yet the party committee didn\u2019t pull the plug until October 19. Meanwhile, the NRCC was barely spending in California\u2014where numerous Republican incumbents were in jeopardy\u2014as of early October. Some money came in late, but it was no help to several Republican incumbents taken down by Democratic challengers.\n\nThe expenditures of a party committee are always the subject of gossip and criticism in Washington, since much of the money comes via transfer from its lawmakers\u2019 campaign accounts. Stivers, the NRCC chairman, came under particular scrutiny this year for playing favorites with certain members, raising insufficient funds and spending what money it did have ineffectively. Adding to the intra-party tension was the emergence of the Congressional Leadership Fund, which Stivers felt cannibalized his organization\u2019s fundraising capacity. Bliss, who was tapped by Ryan to lead the outside group, monopolized much of the cash being raised by House Republican leaders, prompting months of backbiting between the CLF and NRCC.\n\nThe reason CLF became the preferred depository of the party\u2019s elite was simple: versatility. When he landed the top job, Bliss pitched Ryan and the group\u2019s board of directors on creating a field program, arguing that boots on the ground in October would make a bigger difference than the hundredth attack ad airing on television. They agreed on a trial run in Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District, and with its success, soon began opening two new field offices each week. The structures were identical: one paid, full-time district manager, overseeing a group of volunteers, most of them college and high school-aged Republicans who spent their evening phone-banking and door-knocking in the pursuit of Amazon gift cards for the top performers. Democrats won plenty of the 40 districts where the group had a presence, but CLF\u2019s ground game likely saved at least a few Republican seats. One belongs to Andy Barr in Kentucky\u2019s 6th District. The weekend before the election, three teams of a dozen volunteers each canvassed the district on foot\u2014as they had done for months\u2014while another dozen volunteers made phone calls. Their target list had been narrowed over the past six months, and was now down to 46,000 voters identified as loyal, low-propensity Republicans. The Democratic challenger, an impressive former Marine fighter pilot named Amy McGrath, lost by fewer than 7,000 votes.\n\nHer loss could not diminish the Democrats\u2019 stellar showing on Tuesday, nor could it mask the internal struggle soon to play out in the new House majority. McGrath was one of dozens of Democratic candidates to advocate a change in the party\u2019s leadership\u2014denying Pelosi another turn as speaker\u2014and though she lost, many of her fellow travelers will arrive in Washington early next year sensing an obligation to follow through. With Democrats in control of the House for the first time since 2010, and Trump heading into his own reelection, the party\u2019s approach over the next two years will echo far beyond.\n\n\u201cI think the Democratic Party needs to be reinvented, and its message redesigned,\u201d said Phillips, the incoming Democrat who flipped the Minnesota seat held by Republicans for six decades. \u201cI feel very strongly that it\u2019s time for leadership change in the Democratic caucus. And not just generationally speaking. I don\u2019t think the current leadership is in a position to collaborate. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been demonstrated. And if this country needs anything right now, it\u2019s collaboration\u2014setting aside the political swords and getting back to work.\u201d\n\nThe country also needs nuance\u2014which is not Congress\u2019s strong suit. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for people to say good, bad, black, white, red, blue, bad, good, Democrat, Republican,\u201d Spanberger said on a drive down a Virginia highway, heading to her final meet-and-greet before Election Day. \u201cTake that open borders thing\u2026.\u201d Spanberger then launched into a two-minute monologue on the intricacies of detention orders and arrest warrants, the Fourth Amendment and sanctuary cities, jurisdictional issues and legal proceedings involving judges.\n\nWith the Democratic Party undergoing a transformation, and Trump in the White House baiting his opponents at every turn, won\u2019t it be difficult to demonstrate that nuance? \u201cYes,\u201d she replied with an easy laugh.\n\nTim Alberta is chief political correspondent at Politico Magazine.\n\nThis article tagged under: Donald Trump\n\n2018 Elections", "POLITICO illustration/AP and Getty Images Elections Voters send record number of women to Congress Democratic female candidates won victories in swing districts where suburban women helped pave the way to unseating the GOP majority.\n\nFemale candidates for Congress made history on Tuesday night, with more than 100 women sweeping into office on the strength of a Democratic House takeover powered in large part by college-educated female voters.\n\nThe women winning House seats also marked several milestones for diverse representation beyond the gender divide, including the first Native American women in Congress and the first Muslim women in Congress. Their victories mark an undeniable leap forward toward representation on Capitol Hill that more closely resembles the divide among the U.S. population, although women still have a long way to go before reaching parity in both the House and Senate.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWins for female candidates on Tuesday night weren't limited to Congress, with Maine and South Dakota electing their first female governors. Nor were they confined to Democrats, even though they far outpaced the GOP in terms of fielding female candidates. Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn handily won her race to become Tennessee's first female senator, while Arizona is also ensured to elect its first woman to the Senate despite the battle between Republican Rep. Martha McSally and Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema remaining too close to call as of early Wednesday morning.\n\nStill, the night's brightest spotlight belonged to the crop of newly elected House Democratic women who snagged their victories in swing districts where suburban women helped pave the way to unseating the GOP majority. Democrat Abigail Spanberger prevailed over Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) in a district that includes some Richmond suburbs and broke for President Donald Trump in 2016, for one, while Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher toppled Rep.

Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ihan Omar of Minnesota were expected to win their respective races, but they'll come to the House next year as its first-ever Muslim women. Liberal luminary Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York made history as the youngest woman elected to Congress at age 29, but she wasn't alone after 29-year-old Iowa Democrat Abby Finkenauer defeated Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa).\n\nKansas Democrat Sharice Davids, a former mixed martial arts fighter, also broke a barrier in toppling GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder in his suburban swing district. And Davids will have company as the first Native American woman in Congress after New Mexico Democrat Deb Haaland won her own race Tuesday night.\n\nLiberal advocacy groups who helped marshal support for many of the night's winning House Democratic women cheered their strong showing. Jim Dean, chair of Democracy for America, issued a statement hailing wins that included \"breaking critical glass ceilings\" in several states.\n\nThe strong performance by women candidates comes after a midterm cycle widely billed as a redux of 1992's \"year of the woman,\" when a new crop of female hopefuls powered into office. As the rise of the #MeToo movement raised nationwide awareness of the prevalence of sexual harassment, and amid Trump's own polarizing handling of gender issues, women set a new benchmark for campaign donations since 2000, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nAnd a few women candidates this cycle even received a majority of their contributions from women, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.).\n\nElsewhere in the Senate, two well-known Democratic women lost their races to GOP challengers: Missouri's Claire McCaskill and North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp. But their departures may well be exceeded by three new female senators, given Arizona's two-women contest, Blackburn winning in Tennessee and Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) performing well in early returns from her challenge to Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.).\n\nBlackburn, known during her terms in the House for preferring the gender-neutral title \"congressman,\" riffed on the nature of her achievement during her post-victory remarks. \"Now, you don't have to worry if you're going to call me 'congressman' or 'congresswoman' or 'congress lady',\" she said. \"Now, 'senator' will do.\"\n\nRachael Bade contributed to this report.", "\n\nDemocrats wanted a base of power in Donald Trump's Washington and they got it.\n\nThey also wanted to wake up Wednesday morning to a radically changed country.

No amount of prattle about the \"expectations game\" or historical averages can diminish the reality that Nancy Pelosi is poised to retake the speaker's gavel and the vast appropriations and investigatory power this gives the opposition party to check a hostile executive.\n\nBut: There is scant evidence of a mandate for a scorched-earth pursuit of Trump, and Tuesday's gains in the Senate for Republicans (as well as the recent Brett Kavanaugh nomination battle that likely contributed to this outcome) underline the risks of this approach. Despite pouring tens of millions into the effort, Democrats failed to take down many of the national Republican characters they view as most loathsome and villainous \u2013 among them Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Iowa Rep. Steve King, who lives on to freely offer his insights on immigration and white nationalism to domestic and international audiences.\n\nYes: Republican statewide victories in Florida, over a Senate seat and the governorship, as well as a governor's victory in Ohio and basically a tie for the statehouse in Wisconsin despite Scott Walker's narrow loss, indicate that the electoral path Trump navigated to the presidency in 2016 remains plausible in 2020.\n\nBut: The midterms offered redundant evidence (some GOP strategists have been warning of this for a generation) that the party's base is predominately rural in a country growing more urban and suburban, predominately white and culturally conservative in a country growing more diverse and culturally tolerant. Do Republicans really think that losing a majority of people who voted \u2013 as they did in 2016 and did again Tuesday night \u2013 but clinging to power through institutions designed to buffer democracy like the Senate and Electoral College is a wise strategy long-term?\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/2141/1155968404_5858584191001_5858574182001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nThe suburbs, which formed the bedrock of the Republican Party for half a century, are increasingly Democratic ground. The slow suburban exodus from the GOP has accelerated and even expanded beyond the Midwest and Northeast to the South and across the Sunbelt. Name the big metro \u2013 Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Minneapolis, Philadelphia \u2013 and chances are there's a Republican incumbent who lost Tuesday night or barely escaped.\n\nWhose fault is it? Yes/but will hardly help the cause of assigning accountability for the occasional function and more customary dysfunction of Washington \u2014 particularly with a president who is quick to blame his travails on Democrats, or the media, or overzealous prosecutors, or on his own Cabinet appointees.\n\nEven so, people who hoped that a country that has produced a generation of remorseless political combat, and whose citizens when it comes to politics and much else view each other with such sullen distrust, could produce a result more emphatic and clarifying were plainly hoping for too much.\n\nNor was this muddled result a historical anomaly. In Gallup's polling history, presidents with job approval ratings below 50 percent have seen their party lose 37 House seats, on average, in midterm elections. That compares with an average loss of 14 seats when presidents had approval ratings above 50 percent.\n\nFor all midterm elections since 1946, the average midterm loss for the president's party is 25 U.S. House seats. Only two presidents, Bill Clinton in 1998 and George W. Bush in 2002, saw their party gain seats in a midterm election.\n\nIn a previous generation, there was significant evidence of genuine swing voters, people who might regularly bounce between parties, who might actually vote for a president but also vote for divided government to keep him on leash. There are still plenty of people who profess to favor this, though election analysts say there is not much evidence\u2014in an era of cultural sorting and ideological polarization\u2014of people who actually vote this way.\n\nBy accident or design, however, divided government of the sort Trump will now preside over is the historical norm. In the 38 years since Ronald Reagan's victory, presidents have faced having at least one chamber of Congress controlled by the opposition party in 28 years.\n\nAnd while this would never be something a president with strong policy ambitions would wish for, many of his predecessors have found it not altogether an uncongenial situation.\n\nClinton prospered politically after 1994 when he was able to contrast his relative moderation with what soon became the unpopularity of Newt Gingrich and his self-styled \"revolutionaries.\" George W. Bush was still able to implement his unpopular but militarily effective surge after his midterm \"thumping\" of 2006.\n\nIn general, however, those presidents had a degree of modesty about their new circumstances that would be unusual, so far, for Trump. A disoriented Clinton in 1994 summoned all manner of experts to Camp David\u2014including fire-walking self-help guru Tony Robbins\u2014to help him understand what happened and regain self-confidence. Bush in 2006 said his party had suffered a \"thumping\"; Obama in 2010 said Democrats had received a \"shellacking.\"\n\nNo one is expecting Trump to come forward in coming days with a message of self-critique or self-correction that by all evidence he believes is wholly unnecessary. In fact, the president is likely to cherry-pick the results, pointing to the red-state Senate romp as evidence of the popularity of his agenda while dismissing the suburban losses as minimal, a culling of losers and malcontents that will ultimately strengthen the GOP herd.\n\nIndeed, he already called Tuesday a \"tremendous success\" on Twitter and quoted the actor Ben Stein, of all people, saying, \"This guy has magic coming out of his ears.\"\n\nTrump's response was typical of the night's mixed outcome: Yes, he kept the Senate, but was happy to avert his gaze from whatever traps House Democrats have in store for him.\n\nJohn F.

Bernstein/Getty Images White House Trump turns his attention to his own political survival With the midterms behind him, Trump dives into a reelection campaign facing a Democratic House, political gridlock \u2014 and special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.\n\nAs president Donald Trump absorbed Tuesday night\u2019s mixed election returns, two key allies were by his side in the White House: one of his 2016 campaign managers, Corey Lewandowski, and the man who will run his 2020 reelection bid, Brad Parscale.\n\nThe two men attended what the White House billed as a midterm watch party. But the presence of Lewandowski and Parscale underscored that it may have more accurately been described as the unofficial kickoff of Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign. As guests snacked on hamburgers and hot dogs, the president was surrounded not just by the political aides who will orchestrate the effort but also by some of the donors expected to underwrite it, including Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, Marvel Entertainment CEO Ike Perlmutter, and fracking billionaire Harold Hamm.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nStarting Wednesday, Trump \u2014 who has already spent the past several weeks firing up crowds of supporters \u2014 will turn his full attention to his own 2020 reelection campaign, which aides and associates say will be close to all-consuming over the next two years.\n\n\u201cThe reelect begins today,\u201d said Brian Walsh, President of the pro-Trump America First Action super PAC: \"It\u2019s all in and all on the line.\u201d\n\nWith divided government making further legislative accomplishments almost impossible, they predict Trump will leverage the full power and pomp of the White House behind his own political survival.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nTrump\u2019s 2020 effort is poised to swing into gear almost immediately, with the RNC redirecting its infrastructure to assist the Trump reelect and its political director Chris Carr. RNC officials say that a massive midterm mobilization effort \u2014 in which the party invested over $275 million in its field, digital and data programs, and recruited hundreds of field staffers \u2014 was a dress rehearsal for the 2020 campaign. Once the Trump campaign, overseen by Parscale, melds with RNC, the result will be a nearly $400 million behemoth focused on the next election 726 days from Wednesday.\n\nIn another sign of the shift in Trump\u2019s focus, several top White House aides are expected to depart soon for the reelection campaign. They include political director Bill Stepien and Justin Clark, who oversees the office of intergovernmental affairs.\n\nAlthough Tuesday\u2019s results were less damaging than the White House had feared \u2014 Republicans outperformed expectations in Senate races, picking up several seats \u2014 Trump\u2019s advisers privately conceded they had to find ways to improve the president\u2019s standing with suburban and women voters. As of Tuesday evening, Republicans had lost upwards of 27 House seats largely owing to the party\u2019s underperformance in educated, suburban districts where the president will need to make inroads.\n\nBut GOP victories in some major states vital to Trump\u2019s 2020 prospects boosted his team\u2019s confidence. One of president's closest congressional allies, Ron DeSantis, will become Florida\u2019s governor, and the GOP candidate, Mike DeWine, prevailed over Democrat Richard Cordray in the Ohio governor's race. On Tuesday night, Trump aides cited those outcomes as examples of why their path to 270 electoral votes remains intact.\n\nVictories from pals like DeSantis helped to buoy the spirits of the president, who had been consumed by fears that he would be roundly blamed for across-the-board defeats. One even aide called the mood \u201cbuoyant\" -- though it is likely to turn combative once Trump focuses on his House Democratic adversaries, who will soon be armed with subpoena power.\n\nIf Trump manufactured enemies in the run-up to the midterms, from a migrant caravan full of \u201ccriminals and unknown Middle Easterners\u201d to Democrats who \u201crun around like Antifa\u201d before going \u201cback home into mommy\u2019s basement,\u201d he will now face real-life foils.\n\nOne of them is Nancy Pelosi, likely to be elected House speaker when Democrats hold leadership elections next month, and who pledged in triumphant remarks Tuesday night to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Trump\u2019s Washington.\n\nThen there is perhaps the greatest wildcard for Trump\u2019s reelection prospects: special counsel Robert Mueller, whose probe of 2016 Russian election interference could bring more dramatic indictments and a potentially damning final report. His presence, Trump allies said, looms larger than ever in the president's mind. Trump officials have been enjoying a relatively quiet phase for Mueller\u2019s probe ahead of the midterm elections. \u201cI've hardly heard the words \"Russian collusion\" all night,\u201d White House counselor Kellyanne Conway boasted to reporters Tuesday.\n\nBut that storyline could come roaring back any day now. Mueller might submit a final report on his investigation to the Justice Department at any point in the coming months, and he could also bring dramatic new indictments that would thrust the Russia probe back into national headlines. Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., who served as a key campaign surrogate for Republican candidates, has told friends in recent weeks that he believes he could be indicted, according to one of those people.\n\nWhite House chief of staff John Kelly and former White House counsel McGahn have implored the president to wait until Mueller issues his report to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions and clean house at the Justice Department. To that end, they have reassured Trump that the report will be a \u201cnothing burger,\u201d in the words of a former White House official, though it\u2019s unclear whether they were expressing their unvarnished views about the forthcoming report or merely trying to prevent the president from compounding the damage by firing Sessions. Others in the president\u2019s legal orbit, meanwhile, have warned it\u2019s unlikely the Mueller team would toil for so long without issuing a damaging report.\n\nTrump had turned his attention to these new foes even before the votes were counted on Tuesday, using the prospect of a Pelosi speakership to incentivize the voters who turned out to his campaign rallies: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be saying the words, \u2018Ladies and Gentleman, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi\u2019 for the next two years, you gotta get out tomorrow\u201d and vote, Trump told a crowd in Indiana on Monday.\n\nA Democrat-controlled House also dims the prospects that the White House will successfully spearhead any major legislative initiatives in the next two years \u2014 and increases the chances the White House will focus more on politics than policy.\n\nGiven the bitter polarization of Washington, aides are privately bearish about making headway even on bipartisan initiatives like infrastructure and criminal justice reform. They also say that Trump, who had little patience with Congress to begin with and preferred from the outset to do things unilaterally, has accomplished much of what he could have hoped to do by executive order, from establishing an ill-fated commission on election integrity to targeting China with steep tariffs.\n\nStalemate in Congress could make Trump spent more time on foreign policy, in the hope of securing reelection bragging points like progress toward the denuclearization of North Korea and a potential trade deal with China.\n\nOne thing is clear, aides say: As he barrels towards November 2020, Trump will be operating with less restraint than ever. McGahn\u2019s departure has created a temporary vacuum in the White House counsel's office and left the West Wing bereft of a strong voice to remind the president of the constitutional parameters of his job. It is unclear how much longer Kelly will remain in his job. Parscale, who will guide his 2020 campaign, is a relative political neophyte who has never had a political client other than Trump.\n\nThat could leave a president who seems reluctant to acknowledge the possibility of defeat insulated from warning signs about his prospects for reelection. Even as Democrats rejoiced over their capture of the House Tuesday night, Trump sounded a very different note.\"Tremendous success tonight,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThank you to all!\"", "Republican Brian Kemp currently leads Democrat Stacey Abrams in Georgia's governors race just above the threshold for a recount. | John Bazemore, Pool/AP Photo Elections Key midterm races still up for grabs Florida\u2019s Senate race is still uncalled, along with multiple House races and two gubernatorial races.\n\nTen high-profile races are still uncalled a week after Election Day, with Florida in the middle of a recount, several states still counting decisive absentee ballots and the size of Democrats' new House majority and the GOP's renewed Senate majority in flux. Here are the races still outstanding:\n\nUncalled Senate race: Florida.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nRepublicans have secured 51 Senate seats and Democrats 47 heading into the next Congress, but the final margin could depend on just a few thousand votes in Florida.\n\nThe campaign there between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott is the closest Senate contest in the country, leading to an automatic recount. Scott currently leads Nelson by about 12,500 votes out of more than 8 million ballots cast, or about 0.15 percentage points.\n\nThe machine recount deadline is Thursday afternoon, after which there could be a manual recount by November 18 if the race is within one-quarter of a percentage point. Manual recounts do not require recounting every vote, but rather reexamining only \u201cundervote\u201d or \u201covervote\u201d ballots. An \"undervote\" is when a voter appears to have made no choice in a particular race, while an \"overvote\" is when a voter appeared to select multiple candidates in a single race despite only being allowed to pick one.\n\nThe recount has been heated. Scott accused Nelson Sunday of \u201ctrying to commit fraud to win this election\u201d without providing specific evidence, and President Donald Trump has weighed in multiple times on Twitter, including a Monday morning tweet in which he said the race should be called in Scott\u2019s favor. \u201cAn honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\u201d Democrats have argued that once every legal vote is counted, Nelson will erase his current deficit and win reelection.\n\nMississippi is in a different situation: Its November elections have been called, but the state's second Senate seat is headed to a runoff between Republican Sen.

That\u2019s a slight decrease for Kemp from previous tallies, though he remains above the majority threshold that would win the race instead of forcing him into a runoff.\n\nThe shifts are small but the Abrams campaign maintains that the changes show there are enough outstanding votes to trigger a runoff. Abrams' campaign has filed multiple lawsuits, including one over the weekend, aiming to force counties in Georgia to count certain provisional and absentee ballots that had previously been rejected. Ninety-four counties have certified the election results, with 65 remaining. All of the counties are expected to certify the results by the end of Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, Kemp\u2019s team sent out a statement calling the race over.\n\n\u201cStacey Abrams and her radical backers have moved from desperation to delusion,\u201d Kemp communications director Ryan Mahoney said. \u201cOn Saturday, military, overseas, and provisional ballots were reported throughout Georgia. The counts are in line with publicly available tracking reports. This is not breaking news and does not change the math. Stacey Abrams lost and her concession is long overdue.\u201d\n\nThe governors race in Florida is in the same recount territory as the Senate race between Scott and Nelson. But Republican Ron DeSantis' margin in the gubernatorial race is slightly wider at 0.4 percentage points \u2014 still inside the range for a machine vote recount, but outside the range that would trigger a manual recount.\n\nUncalled House races: 6 across 5 states.\n\nSeven Republican-held House districts remain uncalled, giving Democrats the possibility of expanding their current net gain of 35 seats in the House. The latest calls flipped California's 10th District from Republican Rep. Jeff Denham to Democrat Josh Harder and New Jersey's 3rd District from Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur to Democrat Andy Kim.\n\nTwo more undecided races are in California, where Democrats are currently ahead by a few hundred votes in the 45th District and Republicans are up by a few hundred votes in the 39th District. But the final results may not be known for weeks as counties go through the process of counting their late mailed ballots, which tend to lean Democratic and have shifted the margins in Democrats' direction in each of the state's battleground districts so far.\n\nIn Maine, just a few hundred votes separate GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin from Democrat Jared Golden. But with both well below 50 percent of the vote, the race is set to be the first congressional test of Maine's new ranked-choice voting system \u2014 and Poliquin has sued to invalidate the system, claiming in federal court that it is unconstitutional.\n\nVotes are still being counted in Utah's undecided 4th District, while provisional ballots are still in question in one district apiece in Georgia and Texas.\n\nSee all the House results here.

After winning his first governor\u2019s race with 52 percent of the vote in 2010, Walker faced a recall election in 2012 after signing legislation that curtailed the power of public sector unions and won with 53 percent of the vote. He then got 52 percent again as Democrats sought to unseat him in the 2014 midterms.\n\nIn this election, though, Walker spent much of the year warning supporters that a potential \u201cblue wave\u201d was on the horizon and that complacence would mean defeat, as public polls showed a close race all year. He pointed to his battles with labor unions and state tax cuts as accomplishments that had earned him another term after a failed run for president in 2015.\n\nEvers hammered Walker on state education funding and Medicaid, pledging to expand the low-income public health insurance program if he was elected.

Her decision to litigate questions about her Native American ancestry once and for all looks like someone trying to clear the air before a national campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Neibergall/AP Photo\n\nJohn Delaney\n\nResume: U.S. Representative (Maryland); Businessman\n\nAge: 55\n\nWhat he's known for: Being early. He\u2019s already spent $2 million in Iowa and visited every one of its 99 counties more than two years before the first-in-the-nation caucuses.\n\n2020 status: While almost everyone was trying to tamp down their public interest in running, Delaney announced his campaign and stumped in every early state along with airing TV ads.

Her approach to foreign policy, including a visit with Syrian President Bashar Assad, put her outside many in the Democratic mainstream.\n\n2020 status: She visited every early state but South Carolina.

And he's been a thorn in Nancy Pelosi's side, positioning himself as part of the next generation of House Democrats.\n\n2020 status: He stumped in New Hampshire and traveled to Iowa in the past, but if he runs Moulton could lean heavily on an array of military veterans and other candidates he endorsed up and down the midterm ballot.\n\n\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nBeto O'Rourke\n\nResume: U.S. Representative (Texas); El Paso City Councilor\n\nAge: 46\n\nWhat he's known for: A backbench, moderate congressman who transformed into a liberal hero in his failed quest to unseat Ted Cruz.\n\n2020 status: Large crowds, celebrity endorsers and record fundraising sound like a presidential campaign, even if this was just O'Rourke's first statewide campaign. If he can survive potential second-guessing about how he conducted his campaign, he'll come with more name recognition than many on this list.\n\nPete Marovich/Getty Images\n\nTim Ryan\n\nResume: U.S. Representative (Ohio); state senator\n\nAge: 45\n\nWhat he's known for: He\u2019s positioned as a lunch pail avatar of the Rust Belt who has criticized Pelosi for not being in touch with the party.\n\n2020 status: He\u2019s visited every early state but Nevada, and has also reportedly lured away a top 2016 Sanders alum to advise him in Iowa.\n\n\n\nJ.

The biggest question is whether someone who works for Bain Capital \u2014 yes, the Bain Capital founded by Mitt Romney \u2014 can get Democrats to forget everything they were taught to loathe about it.

His ability to write large checks is far more consistent.\n\n2020 status: He skipped the early states but spent the midterms cutting enormous checks to Democrats.

Confirming a potential replacement for Sessions was a much steeper climb for McConnell with his current conference of 51 GOP senators.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nNow that Republicans have a majority of at least 53 and as many as 56 in sight for the next two years, they\u2019re already preparing for Trump to fire Sessions and to steamroll Democrats with a replacement.\n\n\u201cI think Jeff will step aside after the midterm and the president will nominate somebody,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) who could be Judiciary Committee chairman next year, said on MSNBC on Tuesday night. \u201cI like Jeff Sessions but this is just not working. So if we hold the Senate, I think you will probably see a new attorney general sometime next year.\u201d\n\nThe Republican gains in Tuesday\u2019s midterms will also allow Trump to cut loose more of his Cabinet should he choose to do so, with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen seen as other potential departures in the coming days. With near-unilateral confirmation power and more new conservative members, it will be far easier for the Senate GOP to confirm a new EPA administrator as well. That post has been held by an acting chief since Scott Pruitt resigned in July.\n\nBut the GOP\u2019s resounding success in Senate races doesn\u2019t mean their legislative lives will get easier next year.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s job for the next Congress will revolve around blocking nearly everything the incoming Democratic House speaker sends him. The new House Democratic majority is likely to pass bills on campaign finance regulation, gun control and the environment, and McConnell\u2019s biggest source of strength will be his ability to grind that legislation to a halt.\n\nAlthough Trump called current House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday night to note her emphasis on bipartisanship in her own election-night speech, the House changeover also means that the GOP\u2019s eight-year dream of repealing Obamacare is officially dead, at least for now. Another round of tax cuts sought by Republicans is also on effectively off the table.\n\nAnd given that the legislative filibuster still requires 60 votes to do much at all in the Senate, the arrival of the new House majority leaves McConnell with almost no chance to legislate on immigration \u2014 an issue that both his conference and Trump still harbor hopes of tackling in order to build a border wall. With Democrats taking over the House, McConnell likely will have only a narrow window in the coming lame-duck session to try to approve significant funding for Trump\u2019s wall.\n\nAmong the few possibilities for McConnell to work with House Democrats, who may themselves be in no mood to give Trump victories ahead of the 2020 presidential race, are a criminal justice bill, which passed the House with scores of Democratic supporters earlier this year, and an infrastructure measure that could give incumbents in both parties something to sell to their voters.\n\nDespite the legislative headwinds, McConnell\u2019s newly elected members struck an optimistic tone about taking the Senate in a new, more conservative direction.\n\n\u201cWe have two years, a narrow window to show as conservatives we can make things work. We need to get our president re-elected,\u201d Braun said in his victory speech Tuesday after defeating Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.).\n\nIn addition to Donnelly, Sens. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) lost their races to GOP challengers on Tuesday night. Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) was ahead in his own race as of press time, while Arizona's Kyrsten Sinema and Nevada's Jacky Rosen bids to flip two GOP seats blue remained too close to call. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) appeared to be on track to lose his race as of early Wednesday morning.\n\nA slightly bigger majority will also take some of the spotlight off McConnell\u2019s pair of high-profile centrists, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, who have held the keys to much of the GOP\u2019s agenda over the past two years. And the hollowed-out ranks of red-state Democratic moderates is likely to further heighten the partisan bitterness in a chamber where relations frayed to a near-breaking point during the battle to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nMcConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) will also have to reassess their relationship heading into the presidential campaign.\n\nSchumer will run again for minority leader and is not expected to be challenged, but he will face even more pressure from his liberals given their presidential aspirations. As many as nine Democratic senators are entertaining White House runs in 2020 and will look to use the Senate as their own personal platform, creating a fresh challenge for Schumer.\n\nFor the past two years, the tough midterm map gave the Democratic leader a strong rationale to tamp down prospective rebellions from his left. Now Schumer will have fewer vulnerable incumbents to protect in red and purple states, giving him less incentive to cut deals with McConnell, such as one he made on judicial nominations earlier this year.\n\nThat could spell more fights to come, particularly as the GOP leader continues his march to reshape the federal judiciary with an array of young conservative Trump nominees. McConnell still has 122 vacancies to fill on the federal appellate and district courts \u2014 and now Democrats have more reason to fight back even as they have slimmer odds of defeating the nominees.\n\nNot to mention that McConnell will have his own political future to think about: He's set to run for reelection in 2020 and Democrats would love to give him a real challenge if they can find someone to run against him.", "The two men couldn\u2019t have been more different, leading Democratic pollster Fernand Amandi to wonder if the problem is one of organization and tactics. | Daniel Ducassi/POLITICO 'Soul crushing': Trump wave bewilders Florida Democrats\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 The blue wave in Florida was trumped Tuesday by red turnout.\n\nFlorida\u2019s sole statewide elected Democrat, Sen. Bill Nelson, was on track to lose his seat. The party\u2019s exciting new candidate for governor, Andrew Gillum, conceded. Democrats running for attorney general and state chief financial officer all lost; and the Democratic agriculture commissioner candidate trails in a race headed for a recount. The Legislature is still controlled by Republicans.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTuesday night brought home two truths: Florida is Trump Country, and the Florida Democratic Party is lost from what one activist called \u201csoul crushing\u201d defeats.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 failure to win the high-profile races in a key presidential swing state tempered the party\u2019s Tuesday night triumph in taking back control of the House of Representatives.\n\nFor the third straight general election in a row, the Florida Democratic Party\u2019s top candidates got shellacked. But unlike in past election losses, there are no easy scapegoats, no simple answers to what happened to Gillum and Nelson, who has not conceded the race.\n\nGillum is the new, young face of the party, 39 years old, black and describing himself as \u201cunapologetically progressive.\u201d Nelson is the face of the old guard, 76 years old, white and someone who campaigns as a nonconfrontational moderate.\n\nThe two men couldn\u2019t have been more different, leading Democratic pollster Fernand Amandi to wonder if the problem is one of organization and tactics.\n\n\u201cFlorida Democrats continue making the same strategic mistakes, cycle after cycle and then crying when they again come up 1 point short. We can\u2019t continue to operate like the general election campaign begins the night after the primary,\u201d Amandi said. \u201cRather than starting two months out, the party needs to get serious about investing resources in research and outreach two years out if they ever hope to slay the Republican colossus and flip Florida blue.\u201d\n\nThe party did have some wins. It flipped two Republican-held congressional seats in Miami-Dade County and flipped a net of six Florida House seats. However the Florida Legislature remains firmly controlled by the GOP. Florida Senate Democrats also won none of their targeted races, but one of the contests is headed to a recount.\n\nCompounding Tuesday's results by Gillum and Nelson was that their opponents were Gov. Rick Scott and former Rep. Ron DeSantis, two top Trump acolytes. Their performances will only embolden Trump as he hits the 2020 reelection campaign trail in Florida, his second home, which he won in 2016.\n\nFor Democrats, this midterm was supposed to be a warmup to taking on Trump.\n\nAcross Florida, the Democratic Party worked on an unprecedented field campaign this year in conjunction with two liberal groups \u2014 For Our Future and the Win Justice Coalition \u2014 that targeted low-propensity voters, including young people and minorities. Judging by the turnout in early voters before Election Day, the effort was successful, as record numbers of young and minority voters turned out this midterm when compared to last.\n\nBut older, white voters turned out in mammoth numbers as well. And older, white voters have higher turnout rates.\n\nMeanwhile, the white vote is increasingly coalescing around the Republican Party in the Trump era, leading to a racially divided political system. Florida\u2019s Democratic Party is now majority nonwhite while the Republican Party of Florida, compared with Florida\u2019s general population demographics, is disproportionately white.\n\nThe racial realignment of the parties may be disadvantaging the Democratic Party, which increasingly relies on voters with low turnout rates while the most reliable voting demographic turns toward the GOP.\n\n\u201cI agree with Democrat strategists on the left who have acknowledged their problem with the white electorate for now over four years. And I failed to ever see in this election [Gillum\u2019s] campaign acknowledge that problem,\u201d said Ryan Tyson, assistant political director for Associated Industries of Florida, a conservative-leaning business group that\u2019s a hub for in-depth political research in the state.\n\nTuesday\u2019s results also showed the Democratic Party\u2019s stronghold counties, especially in the two largest counties of Miami-Dade and Broward, had some of the lowest turnout rates in the state \u2014 even after an unprecedented campaign to get them to vote.\n\nDemocratic consultant Steve Schale was among the Democrats still reeling from Tuesday night. He acknowledged the party has multiple problems, but he wasn\u2019t sure how to solve them.\n\n\u201cWe have to find a way to authentically talk to those people,\u201d Schale said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a problem we have here.\u201d\n\nThe day before the election, one Democratic organizer acknowledged that party insiders were nervous about the strong early vote from Republicans heading into Election Day. The person said dual losses by Nelson and Gillum would be \u201csoul crushing.\u201d\n\nThe Florida Democratic Party has been in a long slow decline since the 1990s, when Republicans took control of the Florida Legislature. In 1999, newly elected Jeb Bush became the first Republican governor since Reconstruction to have a GOP-controlled Legislature. That era\u2019s lawmakers altered the state\u2019s politics and policies, making sure Florida was a friendly state for wealthy retirees who have continued to flock there and bolster its ranks of Republican voters.\n\nIn 2002, Bush easily won reelection and oversaw the complete Republican takeover of the Florida Cabinet.\n\nAt the time, former Democratic state Rep. Dan Gelber quipped that Democrats \u201cfell to the bottom of the abyss and found ... more abyss.\u201d\n\nAsked Tuesday where the party goes from here, Gelber, who\u2019s now Miami Beach\u2019s mayor, said: \u201cIf any of us had the answer, we wouldn\u2019t be 20 years in the desert.\u201d", "poster=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/3115/1155968404_5858596152001_5858597733001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true Texas Beto O\u2019Rourke drops F-bomb in raucous concession speech\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t go quietly.\n\n\u201cI f---ing love you guys!\u201d the Texas Democrat said as he conceded to Republican Sen.

The Fox News Decision Desk can now project the Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"A lot of listeners out there, their heads are exploding, but this is going to be a very different Washington,\" his colleague Chris Wallace said.\n\nAt a time when it seemed the night could be turning away from Democrats, the Fox News call of the House was the first by any media outlet. And for about 50 minutes, Fox News was alone in its certainty, providing possibly the biggest drama in a night when the overall themes were roughly what pundits expected. Some liberals seized on the declaration as cause for hope, while others on both sides of the political spectrum took to Twitter with evidence-free speculation about why the network had made its call so early.\n\nFox News attributed its quick call to its new \u201c Fox News Voter Analysis \u201d system, launched in partnership with the AP ahead of the midterms. Rather than rely on notoriously flawed exit polls, Fox said its new methodology is based on surveys conducted across 50 states by NORC at the University of Chicago, a non-partisan research group, in combination with voting results collected by the AP.\n\nIt was not clear why other networks were more cautious in calling the House, but as the Fox News panel moved to discuss the implications of the Democratic win \u2014 hurdles for Trump\u2019s agenda, myriad investigations and talk of impeachment \u2014 it became conspicuous that the news organization was on an island all by itself.\n\nImaginations ran free among partisans on both sides.\n\nDavid Simon, the creator of The Wire and a liberal, baselessly tweeted , \u201cGet to the polls, West Coast voters. And stay in line. The dirtiest, low-bottom bunch of Murdock-licking fraudwhores in all of mass media are throwing up a last ditch bit of political maneuver. Fox won't quit until the republic itself is in the grave.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, right-wing figure Jack Posobiec implied without any evidence that Fox News was trying to help Democrats, presumably by dissuading Republican voters from remaining in line to vote.\n\nA few minutes after 10 p.m., with still no other networks making the call, Fox News politics editor Chris Stirewalt appeared on air to explain what happened.\n\n\u201cWhy are we making that call?\u201d Baier asked him.\n\n\u201cWe are just that good,\u201d Stirewalt replied, crediting the Fox News Voter Analysis system. He said, for example, that the close Kentucky sixth district race, ultimately won by the Republican in a squeaker, provided one crucial indicator. \u201cThat was a good one to watch. The very fact that that race was as close as it was told us and told me that the Democrats were getting the numbers they need. They have no business doing so well in a district like that.\u201d\n\nStirewalt offered few other details about how his team drew its conclusion but added, \u201cAll I know is the Fox News Voter Analysis is humming like it's just a Testarossa Ferrari.\u201d\n\nFinally, at 10:22 p.m., NBC News was next to call the House for the Democrats. The announcement immediately prompted chatter on the MSNBC set about the congressional oversight likely to face the Trump White House in 2019.\n\n\u201cThis is a gamechanger. This changes Washington,\u201d said MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace, a former Bush White House aide and Trump critic. \u201cThis changes life for the White House staffers. And this changes Donald Trump\u2019s life immediately.\u201d\n\nIt was after 11 p.m. before CNN made its own official call, further validating Fox News' conclusion. The latter network was also first to declare that Republicans would maintain control of the Senate, at 10:23 p.m., though that call was less controversial by that point in the night.\n\nFor all the build-up heading into election night, there was little other drama on the news networks. Sean Hannity, a day after rankling Fox News brass by appearing on stage with President Donald Trump at a rally, did not appear on air, even though the network had said he would join fellow primetime hosts Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson on the broadcast. Hannity said on his radio show earlier in the day that he never planned to participate in the election coverage. Fox News did not respond to a request for comment about the matter.\n\nMeanwhile, Ingraham sparred on set with news-side colleague Wallace after she suggested the results Tuesday signaled the \u201cthe Democrats are going to more of an [Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez party,\u201d a reference to the Democratic socialist from New York City.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that is a fair thing to say about the Democrats. I think that is a complete mischaracterization,\u201d responded Wallace, who pointed to more moderate Democrats winning elsewhere in the country.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to give the Republicans credit for holding onto the Senate,\u201d Wallace added, \u201cI think you have to give the Democrats credit for actually flipping the House.\u201d\n\nFox News tends to attract a more conservative audience, but Democrats looking for updates had fewer options than usual, as data intensive projection systems from both The New York Times and FiveThirtyEight faltered. For much of the night, the Times\u2019 projection needle was down, and it did not launch until after Fox News had already called the House.\n\nMeanwhile, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s projection figures were jumping around fast enough to give their devotees whiplash, causing editor in chief Nate Silver to tweet , \u201cWe think our live election day forecast is definitely being too aggressive and are going to put it on a more conservative setting.\u201d\n\nFor some worried Democrats waiting for any indication of how the night would turn out, surprisingly, Fox News became the media outlet of choice.\n\n\u201cSuddenly,\u201d observed Columbia Journalism School professor Bill Grueskin, \u201cmy timeline is filled with citations of Fox News.\u201d\n\n", "Kim Reynolds ascended to the governorship in May 2017 after former Gov.

At 80, Brown has served four terms in total, and is the son of former Governor Edmund \u201cPat\u201d Brown.\n\nNewsom, 50, will take the reins from Brown on January 7 in Sacramento, in what will be the first Democrat-to-Democrat gubernatorial handoff in California in more than a century.\n\nNewsom is widely viewed as having national aspirations, and his victory over Cox had been widely predicted in polls for weeks. California has become a Democratic bastion, with the state GOP withering to third-party status and lagging 19 points behind Democrats in voter registration.\n\nThe precipitous decline in state GOP fortunes \u2014 in part due to shifting demographics that have made California a majority-minority state \u2014 has handed state Democrats control of both houses of the state legislature and every statewide office in recent years. And this year, the trend of Democratic dominance threatened to unseat a crowd of House GOP Republicans in what were once solidly conservative holdouts like Orange County.\n\nTuesday's outcome represents yet another loss for Cox, a self-described \u201cJack Kemp Republican\u201d and wealthy real estate executive from Illinois who ran for Congress, the U.S. Senate, Cook County recorder \u2014 and President \u2014 before moving to California in 2011 to try his hand at politics.\n\nNewsom raised a record $58.2 million for his bid for governor, more than three times as much as Cox, who raised less than $17 million. The Republican \u2014 an accountant, investor and real estate developer who is estimated to be worth more than $100 million \u2014 sank nearly $7 million of his own money into the race.\n\nCox was endorsed by President Donald Trump, whose popularity has sunk to historic lows in the state, according to polls. Trump never came to campaign for him here. And Cox, who admitted he never voted for Trump, studiously attempted to sidestep questions about the president\u2019s incendiary language and positions on controversial and racially-charged issues, including the effects of a refugee caravan and immigrants on the state which is home to more immigrants than any other in the nation.\n\nInstead, Cox pushed what he called his \"Help Is On The Way\" campaign: an effort to reduce taxes and regulation for businesses and homeowners; he argued that he would bring back fiscal responsibility to California after what he called years of mismanagement by Democrats.\n\nHe was a strong backer of Prop. 6, the effort to repeal California's gas tax, which he said hammered working class people, though he never produced a detail plan to make up for the $5 billion a year in funding it would raise to improve roads, bridges and mass transit in California. The ballot measure, opposed by Gov. Jerry Brown and most Democrats, appeared headed for defeat Tuesday.\n\nThe Republican repeatedly targeted the state\u2019s political class, including Newsom, as representative of Democratic \u201cSan Francisco values\u201d which he claimed were responsible for growing homelessness and high rates of property crime that he said have pushed people to leave the state. And he needled Newsom as the \u201cfortunate son\u201d who has benefited from wealthy and connected political benefactors, like the Getty oil family.\n\n\u201cTake a look at that city,\u2019\u2019 Cox said of San Francisco at a weekend rally with Republicans. \u201cIt used to be a wonderful city. It was run by my opponent; I would say run into the ground.\u201d\n\nBut Newsom mostly sidestepped attacks on Cox and limited debates with his Republican counterpart to a one-hour radio event. He instead focused his campaign on an upbeat message that stressed what he called the California economic comeback since 2008. He pushed back hard on Trump\u2019s environmental policies and recent suggestions that immigrants threaten its future.\n\nIn a portion of his speech which appeared aimed directly at Trump, Newsom said: \u201cWe don\u2019t criminalize diversity.

It would make her the most important Democrat in the country \u2014 and favorite foil for Trump \u2014 until Democrats pick their 2020 presidential nominee.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPelosi has not formally announced that she will run for speaker but is expected to do so on Wednesday. Pelosi will have to win over 218 Democrats to win the speaker\u2019s gavel, which may not be easy since a cluster of Democratic candidates who won Tuesday night have said they will not back her.\n\n\n\nStill, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n introduced Pelosi to a crowded room of supporters on Tuesday night as the next speaker. \"You put your hands together for my speaker of the House! Nancy Pelosi,\" Lujan declared.\n\nTrump called Pelosi Tuesday night to congratulate her on the Democratic victory and the two talked bipartisanship, but the conflicts ahead will be heated.

It sets a more aggressive and progressive Democratic majority on a collision course with Trump and a Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThe change in power could create two years of intense legislative gridlock on Capitol Hill, particularly as both parties jockey ahead of the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump and senior administration officials are also sure to be subject to a wave of Democratic-run investigations. Incoming Democratic chairmen already have a list of subpoenas and document requests they want to issue, while more strident progressives in the Democratic Caucus may push for Trump\u2019s impeachment, especially depending on what special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe concludes.\n\nDemocratic leaders are likely to struggle to contain the party base\u2019s demand to impeach Trump, which they see as politically counter-productive, especially because Democrats would probably be unable to muster the two-thirds Senate vote needed to remove him from office.\n\nThe House takeover gives Democrats a platform to highlight their vision for the nation, as well as a jumping off point for the party\u2019s attempt to take down Trump in 2020. Pelosi and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) have already discussed passing legislation expanding background checks on gun purchases, cracking down on money in politics and lobbying, as well as protecting the environment, repealing GOP tax cuts for the wealthy and expanding Obamacare.\n\nWhile none of these bills will become law, they\u2019ll create a sharp contrast to Trump\u2019s policies and give voters a clear picture of what the party would do should Democrats take the White House and the Senate next election cycle.\n\nFirst, however, House Democrats will have to figure out who their own leaders are.\n\nPelosi has long faced calls to step down to make way for a new generation of leaders, which she has consistently rebuffed. Still, Pelosi\u2019s path to reclaiming the speaker\u2019s gavel won't be an easy one.\n\nA swath of Democrats who won Tuesday night have already come out against her and vowed to oppose her on the House floor, the roll call that will determine the speaker. They include Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, and Jason Crow of Colorado. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey has also spoken directly to camera and vowed to oppose Pelosi in TV ads, locking her into a position with little wiggle room.\n\nDemocrat Abigail Spanberger claims victory in the 7th district Virginia congressional race while holding her daughter Catherine, 4, during a party in Richmond, Va., late Tuesday night. | Dean Hoffmeyer/Richmond Times-Dispatch via AP\n\nStill, a number of the Democratic victors have left the door open to backing Pelosi. Pelosi has privately helped many candidates who have more vaguely called for \u201cnew leadership,\u201d appearing at unpublicized fundraisers and shepherding donors in their direction. Many Pelosi allies expect these candidates to fall in line and back her eventually.\n\nRep. Tim Ryan, who unsuccessfully challenged Pelosi for minority leader two years ago, said he has no intention of challenging her again at this time, though he didn\u2019t rule it out. The Ohio Democrat said Democratic leadership needs to put the re-elections of these new candidates first and cautioned that it would be \u201cdangerous\u201d for some of these new members to back Pelosi.\n\n\u201cI think they recognize that their constituents elected them to make some big changes and they\u2019re not going to be afraid to hold the line on [Pelosi],\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThey distanced themselves from our leadership for a reason and then they won on that platform and we all need to respect that.\"\n\nPelosi will also have to do some arm-twisting with current members of her caucus. On election night, a small group of her most vocal critics was already readying plans to organize anti-Pelosi forces to maximize their numbers against the California Democrat, although they all know such efforts have failed in the past.\n\nIn addition to the drama over Pelosi, two other septuagenarians \u2014 Hoyer and Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) \u2014 are poised to run for House majority leader and majority whip respectively, yet are waiting for Pelosi to make her announcement before they declare their leadership candidacies. And a battle has broken out for the Democratic Caucus chair post between Reps. Linda Sanchez (Calif.) and Barbara Lee (Calif.), although more Democrats may jump into that race.\n\nAmong Republicans, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) has again been denied the chance to become speaker. McCarthy is poised to announce his bid for minority leader on Wednesday. He will be challenged by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a hardline conservative, but McCarthy is expected to easily win that contest where he needs to win the support of only a majority of GOP lawmakers.\n\nHouse Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), who has his own ambitions to be GOP leader someday, will run for minority whip, said Republican insiders.\n\nThe House Democrats' victory was propelled by Trump\u2019s unpopularity, especially with suburban voters and women. Focusing their message on health care and the unpopular GOP tax-cut package, Democrats made big gains on Election Day across the country.\n\nIf Pelosi can become speaker, she will have to pick her fights with Trump and Senate Republicans carefully.\n\nEven before the polls closed Tuesday, Pelosi and senior Democrats opened the door to working with Trump on infrastructure investments and reducing the cost of prescription drugs \u2014 two rare Democratic priorities that align with Trump rhetoric.\n\nIn 2016, Trump ran on rebuilding the nation\u2019s roads and bridges \u2014 much to the chagrin of spending-resistant Republicans \u2014 and has railed against the pharmaceutical industry for the cost of medicine. Pelosi and DCCC Chair Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n told reporters Tuesday morning that Democrats would work with Trump on both issues, if he\u2019s willing.\n\nPelosi downplayed the prospects of impeaching the president, telling Judy Woodruff in a PBS interview Tuesday night that \u201cthat\u2019s not what our caucus is about.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not unifying and I get criticized in my own party for not being more in support of that \u2014 but I\u2019m not,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cIf that would happen it would have to be bipartisan and the evidence would have to be so conclusive.\n\nStill, progressive Democrats are unlikely to shelve the matter entirely. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler and House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings are already mapping out what Trump controversies they plan to prioritize for scrutiny, which documents they plan to request, and which administration officials they\u2019ll question.\n\nDemocrats are expected not only pick up wherever Mueller leaves off in the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, but also look at Cabinet officials\u2019 alleged misuse of taxpayer funds, Trump\u2019s family separation policy, the handling of the hurricane crisis in Puerto Rice, Trump's tax returns, and any conflicts of interest between his presidency and his personal business.\n\nPelosi mentioned none of these Tuesday, however.\n\n\u201cWe are not going after the Republicans the way they went after us,\u201d Pelosi told reporters Tuesday morning, referring to Rep. Darrell Issa\u2019s aggressive probes of the Obama administration, which sometimes backfired on the GOP. \u201cWe are not them. We are Democrats\u2026 that will strive for bipartisanship and that will\u2026 strive for unity.\u201d", "Steve Bannon, the former chief strategist for President Donald Trump, expressed disappointment at the closeness of some races in Virginia. | Adrian Bretscher/Getty Images Elections Exasperated Steve Bannon: 'Thank you, Fox News'\n\nFox News threw a lot of election-watchers for a loop Tuesday with its early-evening projection that Democrats would win the House \u2014 but perhaps none more vocally than Steve Bannon.\n\n\u201cThank you, Fox News,\u201d the former Donald Trump strategist said during an election night webcast, where the news left him and several other rightwing panelists visibly rattled. \u201cThank you, Lachlan Murdoch.

He tied himself closely to the White House in an effort to make the race a referendum on Trump, who remains broadly popular within Missouri. And Hawley cast McCaskill as out of touch and too liberal for a state that's trended increasingly conservative, citing Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominees and the GOP tax law, among other votes.\n\nMcCaskill countered by portraying herself as an independent voice and leaning in hard on health care, a potent issue for Democrats across the nation in the wake of the GOP's botched attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. McCaskill also seized on Hawley's involvement in an ongoing lawsuit aimed at wiping out Obamacare, criticizing her opponent for trying to gut the law's popular protections for people with pre-existing conditions. But the Democrat was also careful to tout places where she broke from her party or worked with Trump, as she tried to cobble together a coalition of Democrats and moderate independents and Republicans.\n\nMcCaskill has long frustrated Republicans, who blew their chance to defeat her for reelection in 2012, when Akin\u2019s campaign imploded over comments about \"legitimate rape,\" pregnancy and abortion. This time around, Hawley became mired in questions about GOP Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned in a sex scandal, and whether Hawley had pursued investigations into alleged misconduct by the former governor aggressively enough.\n\nBut Hawley's campaign picked up steam down the stretch, bolstered by presidential visits to Missouri and a barrage of attacks on McCaskill for voting against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, a major flashpoint in the battle for control of the Senate.\n\n", "The biggest unknown hanging over the law, however, is a federal court case in Texas in which President Trump\u2019s Justice Department and Republican attorneys general from 20 states are trying to abolish Obamacare. | Patrick Sison/AP Photo Health Care Redemption for Obamacare\n\nDemocrats ran on Obamacare and, finally, sailed to victory.\n\nThe party that bet on surging enthusiasm for the Affordable Care Act flipped control of the House Tuesday night in what could amount to a major reset of the political direction on health care.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDemocrats also made gains at the state level, wins in gubernatorial races that could prompt new expansions of Medicaid and energize lawmakers, who can claim they have a mandate to further build on a law that serves as the bedrock of their domestic agenda. Voters in three states also approved Medicaid expansion through the ballot, defying Republican officials who long refused the program. But Republicans kept \u2013 and enlarged \u2013 their Senate majority.\n\n\"I still remain stunned at where we are on health care right now,\" said Brad Woodhouse, a Democratic party official during the law's passage and now executive director of the pro-ACA group Protect Our Care. \"It vindicates the notion that everyone should have access to affordable health care, that the system works better when more people are in it.\"\n\nThe validation of a law that cost Democratic candidates for almost a decade puts the party in an almost unimaginable position two years after Donald Trump\u2019s election made repeal seem inevitable. Democratic leaders already plan to investigate the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to undermine and dismantle parts of the law, and intend to pass bills shoring up Obamacare\u2019s consumer protections \u2014 including safeguards for patients with preexisting conditions \u2014 and its insurance markets.\n\nThe biggest unknown hanging over the law, however, is a federal court case in Texas in which Trump\u2019s Justice Department and Republican attorneys general from 20 states are trying to abolish Obamacare \u2014 or at least its consumer protections. Democrats seized on the case during the campaign, holding rallies featuring people who struggled to obtain insurance before Obamacare due to a health condition and vowing to fight against any effort in Congress or the courts to repeal the ACA.\n\n\"We didn't agonize, we organized,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said. \"We understood that we had to work together the save the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nPOLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Independent voters broke for Democrats over Republicans on health care by a 48-28 split.\n\nAn NBC News exit poll conducted Tuesday night showed 41 percent of voters listing health care as their most important issue, far more than any other single issue.\n\nThe Trump administration, meanwhile, continues to steer the law rightward, enacting conservative policies like work requirements forMedicaid recipients and expanding skimpier alternatives to Obamacare plans that Republicans say will test whether patients really prefer the law\u2019s comprehensive coverage.\n\nDemocrats' trek out of the health care wilderness was a long one, marked by a series of painful electoral losses and culminating in the election of Trump, who vowed to kill Obamacare as soon as he took office.\n\nDemocrats lost nearly 70 congressional seats in a 2010 wipeout that cost the party control of the House. Backlash to the newly enacted ACA fueled the rise of the tea party and stymied hopes for a continued progressive policy shift.\n\nThey would go on to lose the Senate in 2014, and then the White House, battered along the way by GOP warnings of \"death panels,\" rationed care and one-size-fits all solutions imposed by Washington.\n\n\u201cWe all did it,\u201d Republican strategist Rick Wilson told POLITICO. \u201cI myself worked on plenty of ads that said, \u2018You will lose your doctor. You will have to go to a government DMV-like clinic.\u2019 But those terrors never happen. We\u2019re not in the world we predicted.\u201d\n\nThe tide turned only after the public got a glimpse of a Republican health care strategy they disliked even more. The GOP's shambolic repeal effort exposed the party to some of the same demons that dogged Democrats, leaving Republicans defending a series of unpopular bills in the face of angry protests.\n\n\u201cEverybody has a story about themselves or somebody they love being victimized because they had a pre-existing condition, getting denied coverage or having their coverage be ludicrously expensive,\u201d Wilson said, citing focus groups he conducted on the issue as early as 2009. \u201cSo of course, what did the clown parade in Congress do as soon as they had a majority? They voted to make sure pre-existing conditions were gone. Sure, why not? Touch that hot stove.\u201d\n\nIn a mirror image of the angry anti-ACA scenes of 2009 and 2010, Democrats stormed Republican town halls in 2017, staged dramatic protests in the halls of Congress, and helped stop the repeal effort in its tracks.\n\nThe GOP has since recalibrated toward the center, insisting in the months leading up to Tuesday's elections that it now supports most of the ACA's most popular benefits \u2014 particularly the safeguards for sick people they previously derided as too costly.\n\n\"Republicans proved definitively they could neither repeal nor replace the ACA, but they succeeded at one thing,\" said Tom Miller, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"They made it popular relative to what they were proposing.\"\n\nFew have experienced that political whiplash more than former Rep. Tom Perriello, a liberal Democrat from Virginia who was unseated in 2010 after just one term amid the anti-ACA wave.\n\nConstituents screamed at Perriello in heated town halls leading up to and following his vote for the ACA in 2010. A local tea party group made plans to burn him in effigy \u2014 though those plans were never realized. His brother\u2019s house was vandalized after a right-wing website posted the address and urged residents to \u201cexpress their thanks\u201d for his health care vote.\n\nSince then, Perriello\u2019s state has embraced a core provision of Obamacare by expanding Medicaid to cover 400,000 additional low-income residents. And Democrats on Tuesday made gains in the state.\n\n\u201cI was a believer even in the dark ages,\u201d Perriello said. \u201cThe Democrats were the adults in the room that were willing to vote for short-term disruptions that helped tens of millions of people over time.\"\n\nNow with eight years of perspective and the knowledge that ACA support would become Democrats\u2019 secret weapon, some of the law\u2019s initial advocates say they regret that the Obama administration didn\u2019t try to go even bigger.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental flaw of Obamacare was it was too fiscally responsible,\u201d said Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor who played a central role in the ACA\u2019s construction.\n\nThe law could have had greater impact and potentially could have won more people over in the early days, he argued, if Democrats had quit worrying about courting Republicans and jammed through a more liberal bill that devoted millions of dollars more to expanding coverage.\n\nPerriello agreed, lamenting that he didn't lose his seat over an even bolder heath care overhaul.\n\n\u201cThe first version [of the ACA] in the House that I got to vote on had a public option and the ability to negotiate drug prices,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople at the time said we went too far, but now we understand both on substance and politics that we should have done more.\u201d\n\nObamacare skeptics still contend that the law hasn\u2019t lived up to its supporters\u2019 lofty rhetoric. Premiums are unaffordable for many people, doctor networks have narrowed and, in several states, ACA markets are more like a subsidized high-risk pool, unable to attract younger, healthier customers.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the vast majority of the American public does not have pre-existing conditions,\u201d said Jason Pye, the vice president of legislative affairs at the conservative FreedomWorks. \u201cWe should be taking great strides to make sure people are covered, but there are other ways to do it.\u201d\n\nBut Tuesday's results showed a fundamental shift: a bipartisan majority of the public now believes health care is a right, and that the federal government should play a role in helping people access insurance.\n\nTens of millions of people have gained insurance coverage, bringing the national uninsured rate down from 18.2 percent in 2010 to 10.3 percent in 2018. Premiums have appeared to stabilize after years of sizable hikes, and next year average rates for benchmark plans are set to decrease.\n\nThe law's Medicaid expansion, meanwhile, is increasingly popular even in red states. Medicaid expansion ballot measures in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah easily passed on Tuesday, though a measure permanently funding Montana's expansion through a tobacco tax hike appeared headed for defeat.\n\n\u201cThe law worked exactly as designed,\u201d Gruber said. \u201cThe law worked great, which is actually astounding given the political headwinds.\u201d\n\n", "Sen.

Congress What can get done in a divided Washington Believe it or not, Democrats and Trump agree on a few key issues.\n\nLiberal activists may be shouting for impeachment hearings and oversight investigations when Democrats assume control of the House in January, but party leaders would rather talk about infrastructure, drug prices and immigration.\n\nWith their newly minted House majority, Democrats will quickly have to strike a balance between their base\u2019s desire to seek revenge on President Donald Trump and their electoral mandate to actually get something done. That means talking about wonky things like trade and taxes \u2014 and yes, on some issues they may even have some common ground with a president so hated by the left.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOnce their election high wears off, Democrats will have to find policy victories where they can get them \u2014 while also avoiding two years of pure obstruction that could risk alienating swing voters ahead of the 2020 presidential election. There's a risk that Trump will pursue his agenda through executive fiat, and Democrats will want to have their say on a few policy areas where they agree with the president.\n\n\u201cThese are voters that have observed that the Republican party has gone completely overboard, and they\u2019re hoping that the alternative was to give Democrats a check on that,\u201d said John Michael Gonzalez, a Democratic strategist with Peck Madigan Jones and former House aide. \u201cThe Democrats can\u2019t \u2014 we can\u2019t do what the Republicans did, or we will lose those voters again.\u201d\n\nThere will almost certainly be some focus on oversight of the executive branch. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to take over the speaker's gavel next year, alluded to as much in a victory speech Tuesday night when she said the day's elections were \"more than about Democrats and Republicans. It's about restoring the Constitution's checks and balances to the Trump administration.\"\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know.

But Trump could see an incentive to work with Democrats on policy in an attempt to try to head off a flurry of oversight investigations, said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic strategist.\n\n\"When any legislative body can't do the things it thought it could do, it finds other things to do,\" he said. \"Which means the only way the president will stop the investigations is to allow legislation to come out.\"\n\nWith the Capitol divided, the Trump administration is expected to focus on forging an infrastructure deal with Congress and potentially working to rein in drug prices \u2014 two policy areas typically more aligned with liberals, according to interviews with six current and former administration officials and Republicans close to the White House.\n\n\u201cIf there is anything bipartisan, it\u2019s lowering drug prices,\u201d Trump said at a White House bill-signing ceremony last month.\n\nExpectations that the two sides could work out a major deal on something like negotiating drug prices in Medicare are low \u2014 but there is hope in both parties that impactful incremental reforms, like increasing transparency around drugmakers' relationships with pharmacy benefit managers to ensure there is no collusion to keep prices high, could get bipartisan support.\n\nAnd Democrats won't give up without a fight on bold moves like government negotiation of drug prices, which Trump supported on the campaign trail in 2016. Pelosi met with PhRMA execs this summer and \u201ctook the opportunity to deliver a message about the seriousness of Democrats\u2019 commitment to legislative action to bring down soaring prescription drug prices,\u201d her spokesperson Henry Connelly said.\n\nShe also outlined some of her own ideas, such as installing a Senate-confirmed \"price-gouging enforcer\" who could fine companies found to have increased prices unjustifiably.\n\nAlso high on the priority list is infrastructure, which Trump has long talked about and which some of his former top aides even advocated for him to tackle as his first major push after the inauguration. But congressional leaders and a handful of Trump transition officials instead nudged him to try to repeal Obamacare \u2014 an ultimately unsuccessful endeavor that consumed the first seven months of his presidency and initially burned through some political capital.\n\n\u201cI know the administration wants to move on infrastructure regardless of who takes the House,\u201d said one former senior administration official.\n\nPursuing an infrastructure package means wildly different things depending on one\u2019s political ideology \u2014 and the White House and congressional leaders still have to come up with a basic agreement as to the parameters of a package.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the Democrats and Republicans are just talking past each other on infrastructure,\u201d said Stephen Moore, a distinguished visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation and informal economic adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign. \u201cDemocrats want more of a public works project, while Republicans want more investment from the private sector.\u201d\n\nTrump has also already proposed a $1.5 trillion package of spending that Congress has largely ignored, in part because he proposes it be funded by cutting existing programs and otherwise shifting funding burdens onto states.\n\nPerhaps more likely than a full-fledged package is that the White House and Congress could continue to work together on less ambitious streamlining projects and pass recurring bills like a recently enacted FAA law \u2014 and still claim rhetorical credit for bipartisan infrastructure wins.\n\nOn trade, the renegotiated NAFTA \u2014 now called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u2014 is expected to come up for a vote in Congress in early 2019, and the White House will be looking to woo some Democrats to vote with Republicans in order to get it approved.\n\nDoing so may be easier than it has been in the past for previous trade votes, given that the updated agreement includes provisions to raise wages in Mexico and boost manufacturing in the U.S. that should help Democrats champion the pact.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who led the negotiations, kept in close touch with labor groups throughout the negotiations and appears optimistic the final deal will win their support \u2014 and by extension, that of their Democratic allies.\n\nWhere he can\u2019t get Congress to cooperate, Trump is expected to pursue some policy projects through executive orders and actions.\n\nThe National Economic Council, for instance, has been pursuing a number of energy projects for months, which the White House sees as the next frontier of its economic agenda and some of which it could do unilaterally. The White House by itself could try to make permitting easier and seek to open up more LNG pipelines. It also wants to export more oil and natural gas produced in the U.S. and pursue more energy policy by loosening regulations.\n\nIn addition to viewing it as a policy area ripe for more work, aides also view energy as a potential winner politically. The building of pipelines, for instance, would involve union workers and a good jobs \u2014 a carrot for some Democratic politicians.\n\nImmigration also falls on the list of issues where Trump feels he could take some action alone. White House aides viewed Trump\u2019s heated rhetoric and improbable policy proposals in his closing pitch to voters \u2014 including his insistence that he could end birthright citizenship via executive order \u2014 as a preview of what he plans to do on immigration without a Republican-controlled House.\n\n\u201cThe president wants to do everything within his legal constitutional authority to protect the American people and if Congress won\u2019t come to the table, he\u2019s going to look at every option possible to make sure American communities are safe,\u201d said a senior White House official.\n\nDeclining to provide details, the same official said there are executive actions to come that will allow Trump to claim progress on fixing the broken immigration system and to tell supporters heading into 2020 he did so without Democrats\u2019 help. Trump has already promised to use his pen to restrict asylum claims for migrants who are caught crossing into the U.S. illegally, though the White House has yet to release the text of the order, which Trump first described in a televised address last week.\n\nTaking executive action that affects thousands of immigrants wouldn\u2019t be a first for this president. Last fall, Trump announced that his administration would be winding down the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that shielded undocumented youth from deportation. Multiple federal judges issued injunctions against Trump\u2019s decision to end the program, which was partially resurrected earlier this year.\n\nThe unsolved problem of what to do with the thousands of DACA recipients is something that could be approached again once the new Congress convenes, as the White House and congressional Republicans repeatedly failed to notch a deal that would have allowed so-called Dreamers to remain in the country permanently and without fear of reprisal.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely, however, that Trump would lend his support to immigration legislation that omits funding for a border wall or stricter enforcement measures.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a way the Democrats would be able to pass anything containing concessions to the president that aren\u2019t completely fictitious border-related things,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for more restrictive immigration laws.\n\nThe White House has, for its part, maintained a realistic outlook on how much it will be able to do with Democrats at the helm in one chamber of Congress. A senior administration official told POLITICO recently that no one has \u201ca Pollyanna view of the world, that we\u2019re all going to come together and do big things.\u201d But the hope in the West Wing is that Democrats feel \u201cit\u2019s also in their best interests to look functional.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think they\u2019re going to pick their spots where they want to work together,\u201d the official said, \u201cand they\u2019re going to pick their spots where they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSarah Karlin-Smith contributed to this report.\n\n", "Republican Gubernatorial-elect Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine (R) and Lieutenant Gubernatorial-elect Jon Husted take the stage during their victory party at the Ohio Republican Party's election night party. | Justin Merriman/Getty Images Ohio Republican Mike DeWine beats Richard Cordray to capture Ohio governorship\n\nRepublican Mike DeWine defeated Democrat Richard Cordray in the Ohio governor\u2019s race Tuesday night \u2014 continuing Republican control of the important Midwestern battleground state.\n\nDeWine had 51.8 percent of the vote to Cordray\u2019s 45.3 percent when three television networks called the race with 86.2 percent of precincts reporting.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDemocrats had made Ohio\u2019s gubernatorial race one of the party\u2019s top priorities in 2018, seeking to prove they could compete in the state after President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 victory and reverse eight years of Republican control of all of the levers of state government under Gov.

Wearing brown boots, blue jeans, a garish sweater and a confident grin, Manchin homed in on a crowd of people sporting shirts shouting UNION PROUD and caps announcing JESUS IS MY BOSS. The space between Manchin and his constituents quickly dissolved in a swirl of handshakes, hugs and kisses on cheeks. \u201cGit \u2018er done!\u201d he called out. \u201cGit \u2018er done!\u201d\n\nThis three-plus-hour swing-through on Saturday night in mostly forlorn Logan County followed by a two-day, 11-stop, 700-mile, get-out-the-vote motorcycle ride around the rest of the state added up to the capstone of a campaign that produced one of the most striking results of these volatile midterms.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTwo years ago, when Donald Trump was elected president, Manchin was considered instantly the most endangered Senate Democrat in the country. Donald Trump, after all, won West Virginia by 42.2 points, his largest margin of victory with the exception of Wyoming. And yet on Tuesday night, Manchin, 71, the most prominent politician in this state for the better part of a generation, was reelected to his second full term by a comfortable margin\u2014distinguishing him from other incumbent red-state Democrats like Joe Donnelly in Indiana, Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota who were drubbed soundly.\n\nStatistically speaking, it was a stunning result, a significant party-line swing in just 24 months. And it happened in spite of Trump\u2019s repeated trips to the state, hoping to deliver a knockout blow to a Democrat living on a borrowed time. For those, though, who know West Virginia well, and who have watched Manchin for decades, the victory was at most a mild surprise.\n\nHe won because of his singular combination of longevity, familiarity and conviviality, according to aides and advisers, critics and advocates, local political experts and voters across the ideological spectrum. In addition to the benefit of a flawed opponent in Patrick Morrisey, they told me, Manchin brought to the race what he always does\u2014an uncommon face-to-face skill set, an uncanny knack at reading public sentiment, and a keen and exacting political calculus. \u201cJoe Manchin is the best retail politician I\u2019ve seen other than Bill Clinton,\u201d said Patrick Hickey, a political scientist at West Virginia University. \u201cHe knows West Virginia, and West Virginians,\u201d added Booth Goodwin, a former United States attorney and a Democrat who ran for governor in 2016, \u201cand he knows what is of interest to them\u2014intuitively.\u201d\n\nStill, few spots in America have shifted politically faster and more decisively than this state, swinging from nearly entirely blue to almost totally red over the last 20 years. To maintain his preeminent political standing, Manchin has performed an increasingly perilous \u201chigh-wire act,\u201d in the words of University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato. And the last two years were the most challenging yet. He tight-roped by voting against Trump\u2019s tax cut and the GOP\u2019s effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act while also voting pro-Trump more than any other Democrat\u2014from the president\u2019s cabinet picks to both of his Supreme Court nominees. He was the lone Democrat to vote for Brett Kavanaugh, a decision that enraged his left-leaning constituents. But that vote also robbed his opponent of a potentially lethal line of attack, letting Manchin campaign as a bipartisan, practically anti-partisan option. \u201cHe has done a really good job of threading the needle,\u201d said Hoppy Kercheval, West Virginia\u2019s dean of radio broadcasters and one of its most astute political observers. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t campaign as a Democrat. He campaigns as Joe Manchin.\u201d\n\nAnd that in turn allowed him to maintain a broad and unique coalition: centrists from both parties, conservatives and ardent Trump supporters, and enough liberals and progressives, too, even if he leaves them frequently frustrated and exasperated. \u201cWe\u2019re still willing to give him a vote, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll shake his hand,\u201d said Ryan Frankenberry, the executive director of the West Virginia Working Families Party. \u201cI know a lot of people that voted for him, and I don\u2019t know one person that did it happily,\u201d said Rusty Williams, a Bernie Sanders and Richard Ojeda supporter and medical marijuana activist. \u201cOne of the quotes I keep hearing is, \u2018Yeah, I threw up in my mouth a little bit when I voted for Joe.\u2019\u201d Ballots, of course, don\u2019t reflect such mixed feelings. Votes are votes.\n\nAt Houn\u2019 Dog\u2019s, I tried to ask Manchin about his unusual and durable consortium of support.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s West Virginia,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat can I say?\u201d\n\nParsing numbers and polls doesn\u2019t reflect how Manchin does what he does. It only makes sense when seen up close. Because in the ensuing hour or so, I watched Manchin shimmy into a scrum of people dancing to a four-man band called One Horse Town. He belted out the lyrics to the West Virginia anthem, \u201cTake Me Home, Country Roads.\u201d I watched him yell his approval for a thrilling last-second win by the WVU Mountaineers football team. And I watched him throw horseshoes, calm a crying baby and sneak a shot of moonshine given to him by Houn\u2019 Dog.\n\nGlen D.

Houn\u2019 Dog, it turned out, voted for Trump in 2016, and he\u2019ll vote for Trump in 2020, he said, but he\u2019ll never not vote for Manchin as well. \u201cHe don\u2019t leave nobody out,\u201d he explained.\n\nHoun\u2019 Dog wasn\u2019t the only Trump-Manchin voter I met at the pig roast.\n\n\u201cTrump all the way,\u201d said William Prichard, sipping from a koozied can of Natty Light.\n\nDitto Manchin.\n\n\u201cI believe ol\u2019 Manchin\u2019s a good dude,\u201d he said.\n\nSome 14 hours later, and 120 miles away, after the second leg of the motorcycle ride, at a gas station in Lewisburg, I watched Manchin show up on his Harley-Davidson Road King, cheered on by a cluster of sign-waving women. One had on a hoodie from last year\u2019s women\u2019s march in Washington. \u201cNASTY WOMAN,\u201d blared the shirt of another. She proudly showed it to Manchin. These were the kinds of women who might have been angered by his Kavanaugh vote. But here they were. He gave them all hugs. \u201cAppreciate y\u2019all so much,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you.\u201d Then he put back on his shiny black helmet and roared off again.\n\n***\n\nThis could have gone so differently in so many different ways. He could have joined Trump\u2019s cabinet. (He had multiple opportunities.) He could have changed parties. (The governor did.) He could have just \u2026 not run. (He reportedly considered it.) But he didn\u2019t do any of those things. Instead, Manchin ran, and ran as a Democrat, and he did it with a blunt, almost cocksure edge.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about getting elected,\u201d he told me shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nWin or lose, he was going to do it his way.\n\nAt the beginning of last year, Manchin all but taunted liberal activists in his state. \u201cVote me out!\u201d he said to a group of them on a conference call. \u201cI\u2019m not changing. Find somebody else who can beat me \u2026\u201d\n\nDemocrats around the country worried. \u201cWhen this campaign started,\u201d longtime Manchin adviser Larry Puccio told me, \u201csome folks in Washington shared with me that they had major concerns.\u201d He told them not to fret. \u201cI explained to the folks in Washington who had the concern, \u2018You don\u2019t live here, and you just don\u2019t understand how people feel about Joe Manchin.\u2019\u201d\n\nA nephew of renowned West Virginia pol A. James Manchin\u2014\u201ca parade of handshakes, kisses and oratory,\u201d his biographer wrote\u2014Joe Manchin was first elected to office when he won a seat in the state\u2019s house of delegates in 1982. He was a state senator, the secretary of state and the governor for six years, and he was elected to the U.S. Senate in a special election in 2010. In 2012, in what looks in retrospect like a telling preview of this year, Manchin won by a whopping 24 points even as GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney won by even more\u2014a gaping disparity showing West Virginia\u2019s growing preference for Republicans \u2026 and one Democrat.\n\nIn these last two years, as he navigated his most delicate balancing act, Manchin justified his vote against the Trump tax cut by arguing it would add to a soaring budget deficit and benefit corporations and the wealthy rather than middle- and lower-middle-class West Virginians. Explaining his vote against the ACA repeal attempt, he stressed the outsized importance to West Virginians of Medicaid expansion and coverage for those with preexisting conditions. Nodding, however, to Trump and his legion of supportive locals, he greenlighted all but four of the president\u2019s cabinet selections; he voted against Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, for example, because he felt her school-choice philosophy clashed with the public education priorities of West Virginia. And when it came time to consider the nomination that Trump prized above all others, Manchin was one of only three Senate Democrats who voted to put Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court.\n\nOn the campaign trail, after dispatching a primary challenge on his left, he drew a beatable, comparatively uncharismatic general-election foe in Morrisey, West Virginia\u2019s attorney general but a New Jersey native. Manchin painted him as an out-of-touch outsider, a \u201cyes man\u201d who would answer to Republican leaders in Washington more than the people back home. By contrast, to bolster his own across-the-aisle cred and his Mountaineer bona fides, Manchin trumpeted the endorsements of West Virginia sports notables Nick Saban, Bob Huggins and Jerry West. On issues, he assured voters of his support for Second Amendment Rights. For the second time in his career, he shot an ad by literally shooting a document he didn\u2019t like, another agile act of needle-threading. He has a D rating from the National Rifle Association\u2014he had an A rating as recently as 2012 before dropping in the eyes of the organization after he proposed bipartisan legislation for limited tighter background checks\u2014but few people here think he\u2019s roundly anti-gun. \u201cAin\u2019t nobody taking my gun,\u201d he said last month. The Catholic and pro-life Manchin, meanwhile, expressed opposition during a debate to an especially stringent proposed anti-abortion amendment to the state constitution.\n\nAs Trump kept returning to West Virginia, from Charleston to Wheeling to Huntington, staging rallies on some of his friendliest terrain to boost Morrisey and other Republican candidates but also to try to kneecap Manchin, Manchin often responded with a rhetorical wink: \u201cIt\u2019s always special when the president of the United States comes to West Virginia.\u201d He sometimes, though, added a warning, too: It wouldn\u2019t work, and he told Trump as much. Polls in the state showed support for Trump. And for Manchin. \u201cI am going to win,\u201d he said to the president this summer.\n\nIn the end, though, it was his Kavanaugh vote that served as the distillation of this race. So close to the election, the contentious, nationally all-consuming episode was a fraught scenario for senators in Manchin\u2019s position. North Dakota\u2019s Heidi Heitkamp voted no and reaped a whirlwind of campaign donations\u2014but lost. Manchin, on the other hand, flouted his party\u2014and managed to turn what could have been a lose-lose proposition into a chance to cinch up a win. With his decision, he mitigated potential ammunition for Morrisey, delivered a closing argument to Trump supporters who might have been on the fence about his allegiance to the president, and gauged that he would be able to weather expected rancor from liberals without ultimately losing their votes or at least too many of them.\n\n\u201cMy sense,\u201d said Hickey, the WVU political scientist, \u201cis he picked up more votes than he lost with the Kavanaugh vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was in touch with West Virginians on this issue, as he is on so many issues,\u201d former congressman and Manchin surrogate Nick Rahall told me. \u201cHe knew exactly where his constituents stood.\u201d\n\nIt was true even for a collection of progressive activists from Parkersburg who wanted him to vote no so badly they traveled to Washington and pleaded with him in a conference room in his offices on Capitol Hill.\n\nAfter Manchin voted yes, they were \u201cheartbroken\u201d Jeanne Peters told me. They were \u201cpissed off and angry and ranting,\u201d said Kim Williams, Peters\u2019 wife. They were \u201cmad as hell,\u201d added Cammy Murray, their friend.\n\nThey all voted for Manchin.\n\n\u201cYou have to look at the big picture,\u201d Murray said.\n\n\u201cThe reality is politics is a team sport,\u201d Williams said. \u201cFor all my friends who are anti-Trumpers, it\u2019s like, \u2018Y\u2019all, you have to vote for Joe. This is not the time to be screwing around.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there are a lot of people who feel like we can\u2019t have 2016 again,\u201d Peters said, referring to third-party votes or dispirited no-shows that contributed to the election of Trump. \u201cI see people saying, \u2018I made this choice in 2016, I see the consequences, I can\u2019t make it again\u2014so I\u2019m going to vote for him.\u2019 There\u2019s so much on the line here.\u201d\n\nAnd they convinced others. \u201cThey said, \u2018Hey, we need you to vote for this guy,\u2019\u201d said Simon Hargus, who ran for state senate this year. \u201cWithout them, I probably would\u2019ve been no.\u201d He was far from alone. The Wood County Democratic Executive Committee? \u201cIt\u2019s a whole bunch of liberals who begrudgingly voted for Manchin,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThose kinds of progressive voters in West Virginia tend to be higher-information voters, so they understand the calculation of what their vote means,\u201d said Mike Plante, a West Virginia-based Democratic consultant. \u201cAnd while they may be upset with them about the Kavanaugh vote, or this vote, or that vote, they also realize the alternative is much worse from their political perspective.\u201d\n\nAnd for Drew Payne, a Manchin friend \u201cas conservative as they come\u201d and who was a Trump backer \u201cthe day he came down the escalator,\u201d the only thing Manchin did wrong with respect to Kavanaugh was that he waited as long as he did to vote yes. \u201cHe\u2019d\u2019ve gotten more votes from Republicans if he\u2019d\u2019ve come out earlier,\u201d Payne told me.\n\nRegardless of timing, though, I wondered how many votes Manchin had gotten for himself with his vote for Kavanaugh.\n\nPayne responded with the operative word.\n\n\u201cEnough.\u201d\n\nMichael Kruse is a senior staff writer for Politico.", "Late in the campaign, Sen. Robert Menendez\u2019s ads featured images of Bob Hugin and Trump together and hammered home the point of Hugin\u2019s ties to the president. | Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images Menendez rides anti-Trump wave to defeat Hugin\n\nDemocratic Sen. Bob Menendez was reelected to a third full term Tuesday, despite New Jerseyans\u2019 deep dislike of him \u2014 thanks, largely, to voters\u2019 even greater disdain for President Donald Trump.\n\nMenendez\u2019s victory over Republican Bob Hugin averted a nightmare scenario for the Democratic Party, which, during the final weeks of the campaign, was forced to pump nearly $7 million into New Jersey \u2014 a deep-blue state they would normally be able to take for granted.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMenendez led Hugin, 53 percent to 44 percent with 94 percent of the precincts reporting. The Associated Press called the race for Menendez just before 9 p.m., less than an hour after the polls closed.\n\nThe 64-year-old Menendez defeated Hugin, a former pharmaceutical executive, despite having survived a six-week federal corruption trial in late 2017 and a severe admonishment from the Senate Ethics Committee over allegations he traded official favors for gifts from his co-defendant, Florida eye doctor and convicted Medicare fraudster Salomon Melgen.\n\nMenendez \u2014 whom a source said Hugin would not concede to personally \u2014 addressed supporters at the W Hotel in Hoboken at about 10:30 p.m. He began his victory speech by condemning both Hugin and Trump without naming either of them.\n\n\u201cToday is a victory of hope over hate, for facts over fiction, for inclusion over division, for hard work over ripping people off. I\u2019m so proud that New Jerseyans rejected the politics of personal destruction and the false, negative, salacious ads,\u201d Menendez said, referring to ads Hugin aired that brought up 6-year-old unsubstantiated allegations that he solicited underaged prostitutes in the Dominican Republic.\n\nMenendez spoke of his advocacy for the victims of Superstorm Sandy and support for federal student loans so students from modest backgrounds like him can advance.\n\n\u201cI have never forgotten where I came from and who I\u2019m fighting for. I\u2019m proud to call New Jersey home,\u201d Menendez said. \u201cWe share that New Jersey attitude. When the call is just, we don\u2019t give up. When the odds are long, we don\u2019t give in. And when the foe is bigger and stronger, we don\u2019t back down.\u201d\n\nMenendez was introduced by Gov. Phil Muprhy, who as governor has made it a point to take on the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump traveled all around the country, telling audiences to look at the ballots and imagine his name was on them. In this one, he got exactly right. That\u2019s exactly what we did. And that\u2019s exactly why we reelected Bob Menendez,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nIn his concession speech, Hugin promised to stay involved in politics and \"fight onward.\"\n\n\"I'm disappointed. We came up short. It didn't work,\" Hugin said at his election party in suburban Mountainside. But, he quickly added, \"Let me be clear: Marines never give up. The fight's not over.\"\n\nHe said it was clear the people of Hudson and Essex counties \"have spoken\" and \"they want to keep Sen. Menendez.\" The reference drew a forceful reaction from the audience.\n\n\"Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up,\" the crowd chanted.\n\nMuch of the senator's base lives in those counties, which includes the state's two largest cities, Newark and Jersey City. Menendez had focused intensely in recent days on getting out the vote there.\n\n\"You guys deserve better. I've let you down,\" Hugin said.\n\nHe said he \"wasn't the right messenger\" for the issues he fought on, \"but we've opened the door.\"\n\n\"The reality is that Sen. Menendez is going to be our senator for the next six years,\" Hugin said to boos.\n\nHugin's talk of the future raised the prospect of a potential run for governor in 2021, when Democrat Phil Murphy will be up reelection. But Hugin said that wasn't on his mind \u2014 he just wants to remain involved in state politics, that he suspects other \"great\" candidates will challenge Murphy and that he's \"not anticipating running for office.\"\n\n\"I wasn't planning on doing this race, except that we were morally offended that there wouldn't be competition for the people of New Jersey,\" Hugin said. \"I can tell you it wasn't my plan in life to be in politics.\"\n\nTop Republicans in New Jersey were bracing for a Hugin loss \u2014 and potential House losses \u2014 before the polls had even closed on Tuesday.\n\nJon Bramnick, the GOP leader in the state Assembly, appeared to blame Trump. He said there was little doubt Republicans would have had a better chance of winning races this year if the president wasn\u2019t in the White House.\n\n\u201cI deeply believe that you have to treat people with respect, you can\u2019t be arrogant and you have to show empathy. That\u2019s what I expect of the president, and I think, when I hear his tone, it\u2019s not helpful to Republicans,\u201d Bramnick said as he arrived at the Hugin party. \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned that that rhetoric hurts us in New Jersey. It may work somewhere else \u2014 I don\u2019t think it works here.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Menendez expressed confidence as he welcomed Trump\u2019s endorsement of Hugin. The Republican had spent the past few months trying to convince unaffiliated voters he had an independent streak.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what I thought all along, but I didn\u2019t think they were going to reveal it,\u201d Menendez told reporters at his campaign headquarters in Hackensack. \u201cBut you know, they did. So good. Now we know the truth hours before the end of the election.\u201d\n\nThough he won, it was a difficult race for New Jersey\u2019s senior senator, who has been involved in the state's politics since he was barely out of high school.\n\nThanks to his personal wealth, Hugin outspent Menendez by a greater than 3-to-1 margin, pumping at least $36 million of his own money into the race. Most of the money was spent on a series of negative ads that focused on Menendez\u2019s trial and, later, on the unsubstantiated allegations the senator solicited underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic.\n\nMenendez had to spend several years raising money to deal with his legal woes instead of his reelection effort.\n\nThe senator, a native of Union City, held his fire for most of the campaign, stumping but conserving his campaign cash until the fall, when he began airing ads that focused on Hugin\u2019s tenure leading the New Jersey pharmaceutical company Celgene. The ads attacked Hugin for the company\u2019s repeated raising of prices of Revlimid, its profitable cancer drug, and for the company\u2019s $280 million settlement of a federal whistleblower lawsuit for fraud.\n\nSenate Majority PAC, a super PAC linked to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), also got involved in the closing weeks, spending millions on pro-Menendez ads \u2014 money it normally would have directed to more Republican-leaning and swing states.\n\nThe son of Cuban immigrants, Menendez began his political career as a 20-year-old member of the Union City school board. He gradually moved up the political ladder, becoming Union City\u2019s mayor, a state lawmaker, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and, ultimately, the U.S. Senate, where he served as Senate Foreign Relations chairman when Democrats had the majority. He currently serves as the committee\u2018s ranking member.\n\nAppointed to the Senate in 2006 by then-Gov. Jon Corzine, Menendez won his first election later that year after a hotly contested race that included then-U.S. Attorney Chris Christie\u2019s office issuing a subpoena to a nonprofit that rented space in a building Menendez owned, and for which Menendez had helped secure funding. Nevertheless, Menendez managed to defeat Republican Tom Kean Jr. by a relatively comfortable margin in a Democratic wave election.\n\nHe was reelected in 2012, defeating Republican Joe Kyrillos with nearly 60 percent of the vote.\n\nThis time, however, Menendez saw his approval and favorability ratings tank in the days leading up to and during his trial, which ended in a mistrial when the jury refused to convict on any of the charges against him.\n\nHis favorable ratings remained mired in the 20s and 30s throughout the campaign, as state and national Democrats grew more weary of Menendez\u2019s chances for reelection.\n\nThere were other warnings Menendez would be in for the political fight of his life. In June\u2018s Democratic primary, Lisa McCormick, a little-known challenger who reported no campaign money, got 38 percent of the vote against Menendez, winning several counties.\n\nIt was a clear and obvious warning shot, but state Democrats felt voters\u2019 disdain for Trump \u2014 his approval rating in New Jersey is about 37 percent \u2014 would cancel out their distaste for Menendez come November. They also felt Menendez would be helped by the fact New Jersey has 900,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans.\n\nIn the end, both theories appeared to hold.\n\nThroughout the brutal and often nasty campaign, Menendez tried to paint Hugin, also 64 and a Union City native, as a greedy pharmaceutical executive who, despite efforts to distance himself from Trump, supported the president\u2019s rise to power through hundreds of thousands of dollars in political contributions and as a delegate for Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention.\n\nLate in the campaign, Menendez\u2019s ads featured images of Hugin and Trump together and hammered home the point of Hugin\u2019s ties to the president.\n\nHugin aired an ad saying \u201cI often hear, will you stand up to President Trump? The answer is yes.\u201d\n\nMenendez aired his own ad saying Hugin would \u201cnever stand up to Trump.\u201d\n\nA familiar but unexpected face showed up at the Menendez party Tuesday evening at the W Hotel in Hoboken: Evelyn Arroyo-Maultsby, who served on the jury during the Menendez trial but left to go on a pre-planned vacation before deliberations concluded. Arroyo-Maultsby \u2014 who at the time said she thought the federal government was \u201crailroading\u201d Menendez \u2014 said the trial turned her into a strong Menendez supporter.\n\n\u201cThe trial got me coming here today. Coming here to support Sen. Menendez because all that stuff that went on in that courtroom was a big mess,\u201d said Arroyo-Maultsby, who sported a Menendez T-shirt. \u201cI don\u2019t vote all the time, but I try to vote all the time.

The nonprofit Protect Democracy filed the suit on behalf of the voters just two hours ahead of polls closing in Georgia, alleging that Kemp is running with an unfair advantage.\n\n\u201cThat no person should be a judge in their own case is about as basic a rule of fairness as you can get,\u201d said Larry Schwartztol, counsel for Protect Democracy and a former attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThat principle, embodied in the Constitution\u2019s Due Process Clause, applies with special force to Secretary Kemp, who has misused his official position to try to tilt the playing field of the election in his favor.\u201d\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

This twelfth-hour stunt will not distract us from fulfilling our responsibilities and working with county officials to ensure a secure, accessible and fair election for all eligible Georgians.\u201c\n\nHours-long lines plagued the midterm elections in Georgia, with several key counties extending voting hours at some polling locations. The Abrams-Kemp faceoff is one of the most prominent races of the cycle, with out-of-state cash streaming into both campaigns. Celebrities also visited the Peach State to get out the vote, including media mogul Oprah Winfrey, who canvassed for Abrams.\n\nWinfrey and Abrams were also the targets in racist robocalls aimed at influencing voters across the state last week. Those included someone calling Abrams the \u201cpoor man\u2019s Aunt Jemima.\u201d Kemp has sought to distance his campaign from the calls, which were created by a white supremacist podcasting website that also orchestrated similar calls in Florida.\n\n", "President Donald Trump's advisers said they don\u2019t expect the kind of humiliation that former President Barack Obama suffered during his first midterm election. | Pete Marovich/Getty Images White House Trump boasts of 'tremendous success' despite painful House defeat The president and his aides celebrated the GOP's defense of the Senate, but there was no spinning away the grim reality of a Democratic House win.\n\nRepublicans lost the House of Representatives in Tuesday night\u2019s midterm elections \u2014 a painful blow that will subject the Trump White House to ruthless Democratic oversight in the coming months.\n\nBut to hear the president and his allies tell it, the winner of the election was President Donald Trump himself.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Trump White House seized on the GOP\u2019s defense of the Senate and what it suggested would be limited House GOP losses to portray Democrats as falling flat amid sky-high expectations.\n\n\u201cTremendous success tonight,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet. \u201cThank you to all!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge moment, a huge victory for the president,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said of the news that Republicans would keep the Senate.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

The president\u2019s gut-level gamble to make himself an argument for retaining Republican control of that chamber paid off, completing his transformation from bombastic interloper to his party\u2019s titular head, and giving the White House a major consolation prize.\n\nTrump\u2019s role as the upper chamber\u2019s savior, as he is spinning the results, will reverberate beyond his first midterms because it preserves Republicans\u2019 ability to stock the federal courts with conservative judges.\n\nBut the GOP\u2019s failure to hold the House was an undeniable blow, despite some Trump allies musing privately that Trump might benefit from having a newly empowered enemy to vilify. Divided government effectively quashes Trump\u2019s hopes for an active legislative agenda in the next two years. And Democrats armed with subpoenas will likely demand everything from Trump\u2019s tax returns to more information about his 2016 campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia.\n\nA barrage of House investigations could spark multiple new scandals that will serve as a drag on Trump\u2019s 2020 election prospects.\n\n\u201cGeorge H.W. Bush had \u2018a thousand points of light.\u2019 Trump is about to experience a thousand points of pain,\u201d said a former White House official.\n\nTom Steyer, the Democratic billionaire donor and impeachment activist, wrote the more than 6 million people who subscribe to his emails casting the House takeover as a repudiation of Trump\u2019s \u201cinhumane, destructive policies and for a Congress that will hold him accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith control of the House, Democrats can release Trump\u2019s tax returns, subpoena his family members, and, yes, launch impeachment proceedings,\u201d Steyer wrote.\n\nWhite House aides showed no signs of publicly displaying the kind of introspection that past presidents \u2014 including Obama and Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush \u2014 showed in the aftermath of midterm losses.\n\nBut in a sign that the talk of victory and success had more than a dose of spin to it, White House aides immediately sought to cast Democrats as obstructionists \u2013 weeks before House control is set to switch in January. They argued that Democrats will block Trump's agenda to score political points, at the expense of possible areas of bipartisan cooperation like a bill to improve the country's infrastructure.\n\nSuch talk offered a preview of what promises to be a deeply tense relationship between the White House and Democrats in the House, especially amid the newly ascendant party's plans to batter Trump with oversight investigations.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/1211/1155968404_5858539745001_5858536223001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nAnd as the evening wore on, it seemed to take on more of a 2020 focus for Trump, with allies tallying races in which they said he had played a decisive role \u2014 while minimizing his role in high-profile losses, despite Trump\u2019s furious campaigning across 53 rallies, including 30 since Labor Day.\n\nTrump placed calls late Tuesday to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who will likely lead the Democratic House come January. Trump also called to congratulate winning GOP candidates Rick Scott, Mike DeWine, Kevin Cramer, Josh Hawley, Brian Kemp, and Ron DeSantis.\n\nSupporters pointed to Trump\u2019s last-minute rally in Indiana, where Republican Mike Braun knocked off Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, flipping a key Senate seat coveted by the GOP for six years. Trump made an Oct. 14 sojourn to Kentucky, where GOP Rep. Andy Barr held off Democrat Amy McGrath. Trump also returned repeatedly to Florida to help his close GOP ally, Rep. Ron DeSantis, come from behind to beat Democrat Andrew Gillum and to pull Gov. Rick Scott across the finish line to defeat Sen. Bill Nelson.\n\nSome Trump victories were being pitched as losses for would-be 2020 Democratic opponents: Elizabeth Warren did several events and fundraisers for Democratic Ohio gubernatorial candidate Richard Cordray, her successor as chief of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but Cordray wound up losing to Republican DeWine.\n\nBut in Kansas, another close Trump associate, Kris Kobach, finished well behind Democrat Laura Kelly. In Trump\u2019s home state of New York, his bet on Republican Staten Island Rep. Dan Donovan in the primary was all for naught, after Donovan lost to Democrat Max Rose. Trump\u2019s travel also did not prove pivotal in West Virginia, another state he had zeroed in on, where Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin won in a state the president took by 40 points.\n\nAllies were privately acknowledging concerns in Western states where Trump sunk considerable political capital, namely the Senate race in Arizona between Republican Rep. Martha McSally and Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nPerhaps worse for Trump were the places where House candidates faltered \u2014 especially in the suburbs, where his scorched-earth campaign focused on illegal immigration and demonizing Democrats overshadowed GOP hopes to tout tax cuts and the economy.\n\nAdding to the 2020 motif of the evening was the presence at the White House of some of the president\u2019s most trusted aides \u2014 including former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, his former deputy campaign manager David Bossie and his 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale \u2014 watching the returns by his side.\n\nTrump mingled with dozens of friends, businessmen and donors during a watch party in the residence. New York developer Richard LeFrak, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, oil industry executive Harold Hamm, Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman were all invited to the event, though not all could attend, according to people familiar with their schedules.\n\nAdelson and Hamm were among the executives who attended, along with many others, the people said. Although most of Trump's guests remained out of sight from reporters, Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship league, was spotted posing for a photo behind the White House's briefing podium.\n\nTrump joined the reception around 8 p.m. on Tuesday. But he did not give a speech to the gathered crowd. Instead, he focused on the returns flashing across the television screens. Several Cabinet secretaries, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, were among the attendees, according to people present.\n\nIn conversations with allies throughout the day, and later as he took in the results Trump sounded upbeat about the midterms, people familiar with the discussions said. One person who spoke with the president before polls closed said Trump was \u201cvery calm and reserved\u201d and is in \u201cgreat spirits.\u201d\n\nBut the House slipping out of Republican control was causing early hand wringing. A former presidential aide, anticipating the bad night for Trump in the House, texting a clip from the movie \u201cRocky III\u201d in which a boxer played by Mr. T is asked to predict how an upcoming fight will go down. \u201cPrediction?\u201d the boxer asks, rhetorically, before offering a blunt assessment: \u201cPain.\u201d\n\nAnnie Karni, Alex Isenstadt, Daniel Lippman and Gabby Orr contributed to this report."]
