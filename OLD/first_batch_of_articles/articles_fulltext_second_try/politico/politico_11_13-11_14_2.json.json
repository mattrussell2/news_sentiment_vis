["Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker arrives at an event held to announce Foxconn's plan to purchase an office building in Milwaukee on Feb. 6. Shifting public sentiment over the Foxconn project contributed to Walker's defeat. | Scott Olson/Getty Images Technology What are the risks of the Amazon deal? Ask Scott Walker. Opponents of Amazon\u2019s public giveaways say those governing Virginia and New York should take heed.\n\nThe more than $3 billion in taxpayer subsidies being lavished on Amazon\u2019s new East Coast headquarters are dredging up a cautionary tale from the heartland \u2014 the fate of Wisconsin\u2019s once-hyped Foxconn deal.\n\nIt was just last year that the Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer landed an initial $3 billion in economic incentives to open a plant in Wisconsin, in a seeming triumph for Republican Gov. Scott Walker and President Donald Trump. \"This is a great day for American workers,\" the president enthused from the White House at the announcement 16 months ago, portraying Foxconn\u2019s arrival as a vindication of his \u201cMade in the USA\u201d economic agenda.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut then came more than a year of sour aftertaste about the tax breaks, regulatory rollbacks and other favors that Wisconsin was handing Foxconn. The cost of the state incentives continued to climb while the size of the factory and number of new jobs appeared to be shrinking \u2014 a reality that may have contributed to Walker\u2019s ouster at the polls last week.\n\nOpponents of Amazon\u2019s public giveaways say the leaders governing Virginia and New York should take heed.\n\n\"The fact that Walker didn\u2019t get reelected after announcing the biggest potential state deal in history speaks volumes,\" said Greg LeRoy, executive director of the nonpartisan watchdog group Good Jobs First, which promotes accountability in economic development.\n\nMorning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

By contrast, Amazon is an American outfit whose rapid expansion across the country has been well documented.\n\nBut the massive cost of the tax credits, cash grants and other incentives that lured Amazon to place its new headquarters in Crystal City, Va., and New York City\u2019s Queens borough is sparking fierce pushback against \"corporate welfare\" from both ends of the political spectrum. Skeptics say the negotiation process with the company lacked community input, and they argue that taxpayer money would be better spent on crumbling infrastructure.\n\n\"I am opposing this deal as it stands, and will do all in my power to fight its implementation,\" Jumaane Williams, a New York City council member representing Brooklyn, pledged in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\u201cPublic review is absolutely essential to assess the promised benefits of such a large project, its impact on the community, public transit and infrastructure and to ensure that commitments to the community are kept,\" said Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), who represents the district to which Amazon is moving. \"That now must happen and I intend to make sure it does. A beneficial deal will withstand public scrutiny.\u201d\n\nDemocrats who brokered the deals nevertheless praised their potential impact. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that Amazon's arrival will make Queens \"part of the economy of tomorrow,\" while Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam \"proudly\" declared that his state's \"proposal represents good fiscal stewardship.\u201d\n\nEconomic development officials project that the arrival of Amazon will contribute incremental tax revenue of $3.2 billion in Virginia and $10 billion in New York over the next 20 years. The influx of highly skilled workers could also attract other companies to their regions or spawn spin-off companies or tech startups in the future.\n\nAmazon declined to comment for this story. The company said as part of its announcement Tuesday that \"economic incentives were one factor in our decision \u2014 but attracting top talent was the leading driver\" in its choice of Northern Virginia and New York City over 18 other finalists.\n\nIt's difficult to track the final cost of corporate subsidies and how many companies follow through on promises because reporting requirements vary across the country. But more than 20 companies have received government handouts worth $1 billion or more since 1976, including Boeing, Alcoa, Ford, General Motors, Nike and Intel, according to Good Jobs First.\n\n\"If politicians think these deals are going to help them, I think they should think twice,\" said Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the right-leaning Cato Institute.\n\nGovernments can structure the deals to hedge against some of the risks. In Virginia and New York, the financial perks that go directly to Amazon's bottom line will be paid over time and require the company to fulfill its promise of hiring 25,000 people with an average salary of $150,000. If Amazon fails to deliver, it won't get all the money.\n\nThe investments in education and transit will, in theory, benefit other businesses and area residents, though they're funded on the premise that Amazon will generate increased tax revenue. Virginia, for example, is putting millions into expanding science and technology education, and Virginia Tech will shell out $1 billion to build a graduate school just two miles from Amazon's new offices there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a start but \u2026 the devil is in the details,\" said Aaron Chatterji, a former senior economist on President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. Chatterji, now a professor at Duke University, has proposed replacing corporate subsidies with investments in entrepreneurship.\n\n\"How are they going to measure these milestones, and are these things going to be transparent?\u201d he said.\n\nAmazon had the upper hand throughout the negotiation process for its new headquarters, starting with a public call for bids from cities across North America. It received 238 proposals within months, giving the company a broad view of how much cities were willing to offer in an effort to top one another.\n\n\u201cCompanies control all of the information,\" LeRoy said. \"That makes our public officials incredibly passive and helpless trying to play a fair game of poker.\"\n\nIn Foxconn's case, federal leaders including Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan privately urged the company's executives to consider a site in Wisconsin. The appeal of such arrangements for politicians is strong: Voters will view them as fighting for and delivering jobs to their state.\n\nBut the criticism heaped on the deal with Foxconn \u2014 and now Amazon \u2014 could be \"a harbinger of things to come,\" Chatterji said.\n\n\u201cI do think we\u2019ll enter an era where incentives will be under more of a microscope,\" he said, \"but at the same time companies are going to keep pushing for them.\u201d", "California Gov. Jerry Brown, right, and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke emphasized cooperation and refrained from casting blame for the fires. Energy & Environment Brown, Zinke mend fences at site of deadly California fires\n\nFederal and California officials put aside their quarrel over the cause of state's deadliest-ever wildfire Wednesday as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke joined Gov. Jerry Brown to tour the area north of Sacramento devastated by the disaster.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after viewing the incinerated ruins of an elementary school in the fire-ravaged town of Paradise, Zinke and Brown emphasized cooperation and refrained from casting blame for the fires \u2014 a marked departure from Donald Trump\u2019s recent statements faulting California.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMinutes before Brown spoke, Trump tweeted that he'd spoken to the Democratic governor and \u201cwe are with him, and the people of California, all the way!\u201d\n\nThat was a notable change from exchanges between the Trump administration and California in recent months. As recently as Saturday, Trump tweeted that California was guilty of \"gross mismanagement,\" and he threatened to cut off federal funding.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s pledged the full resources of the federal government,\u201d Brown said of Trump, adding that \u201cnow is the time for solidarity and understanding, and let\u2019s learn how to do this together in the best way we can.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on politics and government in the Golden State.

Now is not the time to point fingers,\u201d Zinke said, calling metastasizing wildfires not an exclusively state or federal matter but, \"an American issue of managing our forests,\" and noting that the soaring federal price tag for massive fires had reached $870 million.\n\n\u201cThis is a national issue, and certainly California being an economic powerhouse, very populous and influential, when something of this nature happens in California people pay attention,\u201d he said in response to a question about Trump singling out California.\n\n\"We have to work together to manage our forests,\" Zinke said, because \u201cthis is unsustainable.\u201d\n\nBrown also pointed to a multitude of factors that produced the \u201cwar zone\u201d the two had just visited, shrugging off questions about the administration's comments or the possibility that a state utility's equipment had ignited flames.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not one thing: It\u2019s people, it\u2019s how people live, it\u2019s where they live, it\u2019s the changing climate,\u201d Brown said.\n\nTrump's previous comments blaming California\u2019s catastrophic wildfires on the state\u2019s forestry practices were sharply condemned as both inaccurate and cruel, especially as the death toll from the fire rose and emergency crews struggled to contain the flames. As of Wednesday afternoon, the death toll from the Camp Fire in northern California had reached 48, with dozens of people \u2014 many elderly \u2014 still listed as missing.\n\nTrump subsequently met California\u2019s request for federal assistance, and Mark Ghilarducci, director of the California Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Service, lauded the federal government for being \"fully engaged with us,\" and he praised the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the White House.\n\nBut Wednesday's united front belied Zinke's record of echoing and amplifying Trump\u2019s criticism. In an interview with Breitbart News last year, he excoriated \u201cenvironmental terrorist groups\u201d that \u201cclose off roads, refuse to have firebreaks, refuse to have any timber harvest.\u201d\n\nAnd in a September Sacramento Bee op-ed he authored with Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, he complained that \u201c[f]or too long, our forest management efforts have been thwarted by lawsuits from misguided, extreme environmentalists. The time has come to act without flinching in the face of threatened litigation.\"\n\nWhile environmentalists, rural officials and the timber industry have long sparred over the economic and ecological impact of curtailed logging \u2014 with some challenges successfully halting or delaying harvests \u2014 there is little evidence that legal disputes have substantially increased wildfire risks. A 2010 Government Accountability Office study found that just two percent of Forest Service decisions dealing with fuel reduction were litigated.\n\n\u201cThe changing dynamic on the ground here in California is that a very large core group of environmental organizations understand that we do have to go in and thin the forests, that reducing the fuel load is important,\u201d said Rich Gordon, a former state assemblyman who leads the California Forestry Association.\n\nGordon acknowledged that California has \u201cthe strictest timber harvest rules in the world\u201d but he noted that major environmental groups backed a sweeping wildfire prevention bill this year that enables more timber-clearing and allocates $1 billion for forest management.\n\nFar more consequential than forest stewardship, forestry experts say, has been climate change\u2019s role in raising temperatures, reducing precipitation and extending a fire season that once ran from mid-summer to early fall into a year-round hazard. Scientists and state officials have repudiated Trump\u2019s faulting state mismanagement by noting that much of the state\u2019s forestland is federally managed and that the current fires have ignited in grass and chaparral.\n\n\u201cReally what we\u2019re in the middle of is a transformation of our landscape by climate change,\u201d said LeRoy Westerling, an expert on forestry and wildfire management at the University of California, Merced, whereas the federal government\u2019s response has been \u201c\u2018oh, ignore the climate change \u2014 let\u2019s just jump in there and use it as an excuse to log our last wilderness areas.\u201d", "Michael Avenatti, who is in the midst of a contested divorce, has campaigned across 20 states since July. | Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images Legal Avenatti arrested in domestic violence case\n\nStormy Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti was arrested Wednesday in Los Angeles and booked on a felony domestic violence charge, Los Angeles police confirmed.\n\nAvenatti, an anti-Trump fixture on the cable news circuit who is exploring a 2020 run for president, was arrested at 2:05 p.m. on the 10000 block of Santa Monica Boulevard, police said.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe attorney held a brief news conference late Wednesday after he was released from jail.\n\n\"I have never struck a woman.

He has never been abusive to me or anyone else. He is a very good man.\u201d\n\nAvenatti, who is in the midst of a contested divorce from Lisa Storie-Avenatti, has campaigned across 20 states since July, speaking to large crowds and selling out fundraising dinners, including in Iowa. Avenatti has attempted to position himself as the Democrats\u2019 answer to Donald Trump, calling on the Democratic field to \u201chit harder\u201d against the president.\n\nOn Saturday, Avenatti revealed he represented a man who was seeking to bring charges against Fox News host Tucker Carlson after an incident in a Virginia restaurant.\n\nSince Avenatti began ramping up his 2020 ambitions, he\u2019s faced various controversies, from getting into verbal scrums with Donald Trump Jr. over Twitter to facing a backlash over comments he made, according to Time, that the person to run against Trump \u201cbetter be a white male.\u201d Avenatti said he was taken out of context, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a f------ outrage.\u201d Last month, the Senate Judiciary Committee referred Avenatti and his client Julie Swetnick to the Justice Department for an investigation into false statements after she leveled sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, then a Supreme Court nominee.\n\nAvenatti also faced his share of troubles in civil court. As part of their divorce case, his second wife sought $215,643 a month in family support. And in October, a Los Angeles judge issued an order saying Avenatti must pay $4.85 million to a former law colleague who claimed he was owed millions of dollars in profit.\n\nAt the time, Avenatti told POLITICO there was nothing in his past that would rule out a potential run for president.

Twenty judicial nominees are currently waiting for a vote in the Judiciary panel, in addition to another nominee still awaiting a hearing, and 32 nominees have already cleared committee but not yet gotten a floor vote.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) objected on the floor to Flake\u2019s request for a vote on the Mueller protection legislation. McConnell can seek to bring nominees straight to the floor without a favorable verdict from the Judiciary Committee \u2014 although such moves are rare. And with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a tie, it\u2019s possible to confirm the nominees already teed up for a floor vote without Flake\u2019s support.\n\nEven so, Flake\u2019s move raises the stakes of debate on a Mueller protection measure that cleared the Judiciary panel in April but has stalled without a floor vote as McConnell reiterates doubt that the special counsel\u2019s job is in danger. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has said he'll push for the Mueller bill to get added to spending legislation that must pass to keep the government open past Dec. 7, but it's unclear whether Democrats have enough leverage to extract that concession.\n\n\"There has to be a viable strategy, because there's enough support for protecting the special counsel that I think ... there will be a way to do it,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who added that fellow Democrats are \"still thinking through\" how best to force consideration of the bill.\n\nDemocrats appear to have their work cut out for them. Trump's ouster of Attorney General Jeff Sessions is perceived by many of the president\u2019s critics as a pretext to ending Mueller's probe. But it also hasn\u2019t appeared to shake the GOP consensus that the special counsel is safe to finish his investigation into Russian interference and any alleged wrongdoing by Trump.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, one of the lead Republican authors of the Mueller protection bill, said Wednesday that he didn't foresee Sessions' ouster heightening the \"threat of Mueller being prevented from finishing his business.\"\n\nAt a press conference after their floor remarks, Flake and Coons said that they would consider joining the push to add the Mueller protection bill to a must-pass spending bill. Flake acknowledged that he had less power given that Pence could break a tie during floor votes but reiterated the importance of opposing nominees in committee.\n\n\"There's such a slim margin on the floor and some members are sticklers for precedent,\" he said. \"You don't want to get in the habit of nullifying a committee action.\"\n\nFlake said that he was also speaking to fellow GOP members about taking similar actions against judicial nominees whose floor votes are pending and predicted that if the Senate votes on the bill, it will \"pass overwhelmingly.\"\n\nThe Arizona Republican also joined Coons and many other Democrats in calling for Sessions' replacement, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, to recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation.", "To some expert observers, movement toward sentencing of former Trump Deputy Campaign Manager Rick Gates is a sign that special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe is nearing an end. | Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Legal Mueller delays sentencing for ex-Trump aide Gates over ongoing cooperation The delay stands in contrast to two other high-profile former Trump officials who are moving toward sentencing in the Mueller investigation.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller again pushed back the sentencing of former Donald Trump campaign deputy Rick Gates because the longtime GOP operative is still cooperating on \"several ongoing investigations.\"\n\nThe delay, laid out in a new one-page joint filing , stands in contrast to two other high-profile former Trump officials \u2014 Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort \u2014 who are moving toward sentencing after also pleading guilty and cooperating with the special counsel\u2019s probe.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut in a Wednesday memo filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit, attorneys for Mueller and Gates confirmed that Gates \u201ccontinues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations, and accordingly the parties do not believe it is appropriate to commence the sentencing process at this time.\u201d\n\nBoth sides agreed to give the court another update by January 15 on his cooperation and whether they\u2019re ready to move toward sentencing for Gates, who pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy against the U.S. and making a false statement in a federal investigation.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Christie has been clear in the past that he desires the job and has turned down other cabinet positions.\n\nThe Republican, who left office in January after hitting a two-term limit, is now an attorney in private practice and a political analyst for ABC News. He has moved toward the front of the line for the attorney general job since Sessions was pushed out after it became clear several other potential nominees were not interested in the position.\n\nPOLITICO reported last week that Trump has said privately he believes Christie, the first prominent Republican to back his presidential bid, has patiently waited his turn after being passed over for the job during the post-2016 election transition.\n\nChristie played coy when asked if he would accept the nomination if asked.\n\n\u201cListen, the only person I owe that answer to is the president of the United States if the question is asked and, if he asks, I\u2019ll answer like I always do,\u201d Christie said.\n\nA former U.S. attorney who ran a losing campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, Christie said he had \u201cbeen through this dance before,\u201d noting he was considered for the vice presidency in 2012 and 2016, and \u201cfor a whole bunch of different positions in this administration.\u201d\n\nHe also chaired Trump's transition team before 2016 election, but was removed from that role within days of the president's victory.

Nelson would have to have a perfect hand,\u201d said Michael Morley, a Florida State University election law professor. | AP Photo Nelson will likely come up short in recount battle against Scott\n\nMIAMI \u2014 Sen. Bill Nelson has flooded the Florida courts with lawsuits, claiming that his Senate race against Gov. Rick Scott has been marred by an unfair treatment of absentee ballot mail-in deadlines and signature mismatches, among a host of other issues.\n\nBut experts say Nelson faces long odds in his bid to flip the results in the race, with Scott leading by 12,652 votes heading into the contest's automatic recount, which ends Thursday and will likely lead to a manual recount next.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNelson has two major problems, experts say: Nelson's lawsuits were filed so late and courts generally frown on last-minute post-election changes, and the margin he trails Scott by is so big that even expanding the pool of available ballots to count makes it highly unlikely that Nelson could make up enough ground.\n\n\u201cA royal flush is right on the money. Nelson would have to have a perfect hand,\u201d said Michael Morley, a Florida State University election law professor, echoing two other experts who spoke to POLITICO.\n\n\u201cHe would have to win in every case. And even then, it would not seem to be enough to change the outcome,\u201d Morley said. \u201cOne study that I\u2019ve seen shows that in the 21st Century, there have only been three statewide races that have had their results changed as a result of a recount. And in each of those races, the margins were in the hundreds, not more than 12,000.\u201d\n\nAs of the most recent update, only 7,871 absentee ballots were rejected statewide due to \u201cvoter error,\u201d which could include mismatched signatures on the ballots compared with what\u2019s on file with the state. And of them, 35 percent were cast by Republicans, 36 percent by Democrats and 29 percent by independents. Another 10,186 ballots were rejected because their envelopes were unsigned. Of them, 31 percent were cast by Republicans, 44 percent by Democrats and 24 percent by independents.\n\nSo if all those ballots were counted, Nelson would have to win 85 percent of them statewide in an election where he couldn\u2019t get 50 percent of the vote so far.\n\nOn Wednesday, the state\u2019s elections division director provided more specificity when she testified in Nelson\u2019s signature mismatch suit by revealing that 3,688 mail-in absentee ballots and another 93 provisional ballots were rejected for mismatches by 45 counties, a count that didn\u2019t include the large counties of Miami-Dade or Duval.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rabbit out of a hat. But there\u2019s not enough rabbit,\u201d one Republican lawyer involved in the recount who spoke to POLITICO on the condition of anonymity said of Nelson\u2019s strategy and predicament.\n\nThe lawsuit over mismatched signatures for absentee ballots was heard Wednesday in federal court in Tallahassee. Nelson\u2019s campaign has also sued over deadlines for the receipt of absentee ballots, standards for divining voter intent and the deadline to finish the recount.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many ballots would be counted if Nelson\u2019s lawsuits prevail. For instance, many county election supervisors have not logged absentee ballots that arrived after 7 p.m. on Election Day but were postmarked on Election Day.\n\nThe volume of those lawsuits might also pose a problem for Nelson because it just might be too much, Morley said, noting that \u201cthe more you\u2019re challenging, the more you\u2019re asking the court to do, and the greater burden you\u2019re bringing on yourself.\u201d\n\nMorley, Ohio State University election law professor Ned Foley and University of California election law professor Rick Hasen all indicated that the strongest defense for the state \u2014 which Nelson\u2019s campaign and various Democrats are suing \u2014 rests in the timing issue of lawsuits that are simply filed too late, a principle enshrined in a legal principle against \u201clegal ambush\u201d called \u201claches.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the law professors who believe suits brought after Election Day are problematic. Nelson\u2019s lead attorney in his cases, Marc Elias, has specifically cited laches and Purcell to argue against a late-filed lawsuit concerning signature mismatches \u2014 however that case was in the Arizona Senate race, where the Democrat was ahead and therefore wanted no more ballots to be counted.\n\nElias and a co-counsel for the Arizona Democratic Party noted in a legal brief that some Arizona counties allow voters to address signature mismatches on early ballots they\u2019ve submitted up to five business days before Election Day but that the Arizona lawsuit wasn\u2019t filed until after the election and voters had no more chance to fix the anomalies.\n\nScott\u2019s campaign noted the discrepancy in a written statement.\n\n\u201cTo put it simply, Democrats in Arizona are using the opposite and contradictory argument to the one they plan to use in court tomorrow in Tallahassee,\u201d the Scott campaign said Tuesday. \u201cFor them, this isn\u2019t about following the law, and it isn\u2019t about having a free and fair election. This is about getting rid of Florida laws they don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nNelson's campaign has said he just wants every vote counted.\n\n\u201cGiven the closeness of this election, and the fact that the courts have declared signature-matching laws unconstitutional in several states, we expect this issue to be of considerable importance here in Florida,\" Nelson said in a written statement. \"So I ask each of you \u2014 just consider whether or not you would want your ballot thrown out by an untrained, even though well-intentioned, election worker or a volunteer, all because he or she determined that your signature doesn't look right.\"\n\nHasen, who blogs about election law while teaching at U.C. Irvine, said in a post about Nelson\u2019s suits that he\u2019s \u201csympathetic to the arguments in general, given my belief that election statutes, when possible should be interpreted to enfranchise voters. But Florida laws were rewritten after the 2000 Bush v. Gore debacle to deal with giving too much discretion to election officials to decide on what counts as a valid vote, and rules that are clear in advance are the best for fair election administration.\u201d\n\nThe Senate race had a significant number of undervotes compared to the governor\u2019s race, which is also being recounted, in problematic Broward County.\n\nThe undervotes \u2014 which happen where no one chooses a candidate in a race \u2014 are to be analyzed manually if at the end of the machine recount the margin in the race remains within a quarter percentage point. The Senate margin was 0.153 points at the start of the machine recount in a race where nearly 8.2 million votes were cast. County canvassing officials will also examine overvotes, in which more than one candidate was chosen.\n\nNelson is challenging the standards by which voter intent is divined in recounts.\n\nBroward, a large Democratic-heavy county, had a notably large undervote in the Senate race, marking the first time that fewer people in the county voted for Senate when compared to all other down-ballot statewide races. Nelson\u2019s campaign is holding out hope that the undervote was a result of machine error or difficulty in reading ballots. But even if the Senate race in Broward got the same total votes as the gubernatorial contest, Nelson would have to win the additional pool of 26,105 votes by a 50-point margin in a county that he carried by 38 points.\n\nBut experts, including Democratic data analyst Matt Isbell, caution that most undervotes in the county won\u2019t count anyway because they\u2019re more likely the result of bad ballot design; the Senate race was tucked just below the voting instructions in the left hand corner of the page and many voters likely didn\u2019t see it. If that\u2019s the case and voters just missed voting in the race, Florida law does not expressly allow officials to guess at the voter\u2019s choice. And so Nelson could lose a major chance to make up ground.\n\nStill, the results of the automatic recount are likely to change the margins in the race \u2014 though the degree is unclear \u2014 and the manual recount should change it more.\n\nAnd that makes the changing of the law so crucial to Nelson to expand the pool of available votes.\n\nBut Ohio State\u2019s Foley said that yet another case, Roe v. Alabama, by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 which oversees Florida \u2014 espoused a principle that \u201cballots must be counted according to the rules for counting ballots at the time those ballots were cast. So even though it\u2019s not the most desirable rule for counting ballots, you can\u2019t change counting rules in the middle of the election itself.\u201d\n\nStill, he said, there\u2019s a general legal principle that voters\u2019 rights to have their ballots counted fairly pervades all election law and that the facts of the cases brought by Nelson will dictate their outcome.\n\nMorley, the FSU professor, said that in the unlikely event Nelson can \u201crun the table\u201d in court, he just can\u2019t see how the Democrat could pull ahead.\n\n\u201cWhere are the votes going to come from?\u201d he said.", "Sen.-elect Kyrsten Sinema told POLITICO while campaigning in July that she would vote against Chuck Schumer for minority leader. | Win McNamee/Getty Images Congress Sinema: I would have considered 'new leadership' if Schumer had a challenger\n\nSen.-elect Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) said Wednesday that she would have considered voting for someone other than Sen.

The decision came while Bolton, Ricardel's strongest defender, was in Singapore for a key international summit.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the president\u2019s wife issued a statement through her official spokeswoman that said, \u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.\u201d Melania Trump had personally approved the statement, aides said.\n\nWest Wing aides were alerted to the upcoming statement just moments before it was sent to reporters, according to the administration officials.\n\nThe Tuesday statement reflected exasperation on the part of Melania Trump and her staff, who had told Trump\u2019s top West Wing aides that they were unhappy with Ricardel, who held what has traditionally been one of the government's most sensitive jobs, coordinating advice on national security issues from multiple departments and agencies. The two administration officials said chief of staff John Kelly had repeatedly pushed Bolton to fire Ricardel.\n\nKelly and Bolton have clashed behind the scenes before. The chief of staff erupted in anger and obscenities last month when Bolton criticized Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Kelly\u2019s closest ally in the administration.\n\nAs head of the Defense Department\u2019s transition team after the 2016 election, Ricardel clashed with Mattis over personnel issues. She also butted heads with officials at the Department of Homeland Security, according to an administration official.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty well known that she\u2019s hard to work with,\u201d said the official. \u201cIt\u2019s been just a rocky relationship. She\u2019s confrontational.\"\n\nThe first lady indicated in an interview during her October trip to Africa that she had expressed concerns in the past about certain White House staffers to her husband, though not all of them had been removed from their jobs.\n\nAsked by ABC News\u2019 Tom Llamas whether she had relayed to Trump which staffers she didn\u2019t trust, the first lady responded that she \u201cgave him my honest advice.\u201d Asked what Trump did with her advice, she responded that \u201csome people, they don\u2019t work there anymore.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, aides to the first lady said privately earlier Wednesday they had done all they could to oust Ricardel. The decision was now in the hands of the president and his top advisers, the aides said, adding that they didn't intend to say anything more on the subject publicly.\n\n\u201cShe is strong and independent and when she feels something needs to be said, she says it,\u201d one White House official said of the first lady. \u201cMrs. Trump always does what she feels is right with no regard to what people will think of her \u2014 this should be celebrated, not considered any kind of slight towards her husband.\u201d\n\nMelania Trump's small, tight-knit group of a dozen East Wing staffers operates largely independently from the West Wing. The first lady values that independence, according to people close to her, and she chafes at any perceived efforts to control her.\n\nAmid a national uproar in June over a Trump administration policy \u2014 personally defended by her husband \u2014 that separated children from parents crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, the president\u2019s wife issued another statement that seemed to broadcast frustration with the White House.\n\n\u201cMrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,\" her communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said. \"She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.\"\n\nIn a statement after Ricardel's hiring earlier this year, Bolton lavished praise on his new deputy.\n\n\u201cMira Ricardel has a track record of successfully managing teams and diverse organizations, as well as addressing complex issues,\u201d Bolton said.\n\n\u201cI selected her as Deputy National Security Advisor because her expertise is broad-based and includes national security matters related to our alliances, defense posture, technology security, foreign security assistance, and arms control. Her policy-making and interagency experience will make her a great addition to the National Security Council,\" he added.\n\nDaniel Lippman contributed to this report.", "Rep.

I know they want to impeach the president,\" McCarthy said. \"I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the agenda Americans want.\"\n\nMcCarthy's comments came shortly after his colleagues and incoming GOP freshmen elected him to be the top House Republican in next year's Congress, easily casting aside a challenge for the post from conservative firebrand Rep.

Back then, McCarthy was running for speaker but ran into opposition from the Freedom Caucus and withdrew his name from consideration. That cleared the way for Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to become speaker.\n\nRyan announced in April he would retire from the House; amid intense jockeying behind the scenes to replace him, McCarthy consistently remained the front-runner.\n\nHouse Republicans also filled out the rest of their leadership team for the new Congress with few surprises.\n\nRep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana will be minority whip, and Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming \u2014 a rising star in the party and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney \u2014 will be Republican Conference chairwoman. Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina will be vice chair and Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota will chair the National Republican Campaign Committee. Rep. Gary Palmer of Alabama will lead the Republican Policy Committee. Palmer is the first member of the Freedom Caucus to capture a leadership role.\n\nFollowing McCarthy's comments, Cheney gave a nod to the GOP's struggles among women and minorities. She insisted that Republicans would \"take a back seat to no one\" when it comes to \"doing what's right for America's women, America's minorities.\"\n\nMcCarthy also acknowledged Republicans' struggles in the suburbs.\n\n\"We took a beating inside the suburban areas,\" he said, adding, \"Our ideas are going to have to be stronger.\"\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s victory is a bittersweet one, coming as Republicans prepare to hand the speaker's gavel back to Democrats for the first time in eight years.\n\nDragged down by history and Trump\u2019s dismal poll numbers, Democrats enjoyed their biggest House victory since the Watergate scandal of the 1970s. Democrats are on track to gain 35 to 40 seats, including a slew in McCarthy\u2019s home state of California, where an already small number of Republican House members saw their ranks shrink dramatically.\n\nMcCarthy didn't mention Trump in his remarks after the leadership elections, instead alluding to him only when asked about the reason for GOP losses. He criticized Democrats for what he said seemed to be a plan to impeach the president, though Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has rebuffed the notion. He also sidestepped a question about whether Trump's unpopularity and divisive rhetoric hurt Republicans in the elections \u2014 saying only that presidents nearly always see their party lose seats in the midterms.\n\nIn McCarthy's pitch to the GOP Conference, multiple members said the Californian touted his role in recapturing the House from Democrats back in 2010 \u2014 a feat Republicans are now solely focused on repeating.\n\n\u201cI think the consensus was, he could unify us. He helped us win back the majority from Nancy Pelosi once, and we believe he can do it again,\u201d Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) told reporters.\n\nMultiple GOP veterans left Wednesday\u2019s meeting visibly energized and ready to spar with Democratic leaders.\n\n\u201cWe know the Democrats\u2019 base is going to be pushing them toward investigations and impeachments ad nauseam, probably Cabinet officials, maybe a Supreme Court justice, certainly a president,\u201d said Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), a longtime lawmaker who helped lead the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998. \u201cWhen they overreach, which I\u2019m sure they will, then I think we should push back and we should push back aggressively,\u201d added Chabot, who is running for the top GOP spot on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nMcCarthy was nominated for the post by House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry, (R-Texas); Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Brian Mast (R-Fla.) also spoke in favor.\n\nThe California Republican will still have to deal with Jordan, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and other House conservatives who have made headaches for GOP leaders over the years.\n\nPOLITICO reported Tuesday night that Trump urged McCarthy to \u201cmake everybody happy\u201d in regard to Jordan, who wants to be ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. However, Jordan is not popular with other House Republicans and may not be able to jump over more senior lawmakers for the Judiciary post.\n\nIn his remarks, McCarthy thanked Jordan for running against him but gave little indication of what he expects Jordan's role to be in the next Congress.\n\nMeadows told reporters that he thinks Jordan has earned a look to lead Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, a role that would make him Trump's most prominent defender in any impeachment probe.\n\nJordan left the vote without speaking to reporters, but Meadows said Jordan was \"gratified\" to receive the 43 votes he got. He also said McCarthy would be a \"good leader\" and would \"do his best to bring everybody together.\"\n\nAsked whether Jordan should be elevated to the top GOP slot on the Judiciary Committee, Meadows added, \"I think Jim\u2019s earned the position for ranking member on Judiciary. But that\u2019s not my call.\"\n\nOther Jordan allies on the House Freedom Caucus signaled that they had made peace with McCarthy\u2019s victory, particularly after one of their own won a spot on the GOP leadership team.\n\n\u201cIn terms of right now, I think we made the right choice in Kevin,\u201d Palmer told reporters. \u201cWhen we get the majority back, [Jordan will] chair, and he will be a force to be reckoned with.\u201d\n\n", "President Donald Trump's endorsement of the bill means Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could be headed into a fight that will divide their fellow Republicans, something McConnell prefers to avoid. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo congress Trump endorses criminal justice bill that divides McConnell's GOP\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday endorsed a criminal justice deal taking shape in Congress, giving a boost to the measure even as it faces a cool reception in the Senate from Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the package, which includes sentencing reform provisions that divide the Senate Republican Caucus, would get through the Senate. Reformers like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) back the legislation, while others like Sen.

Among those negotiated sentencing changes are lower mandatory minimums for drug-related offenses and the addition of retroactivity to a 2010 law that closed the sentencing disparity for crack and cocaine offenses.\n\nThe addition of those sentencing changes makes for a more substantive measure than the narrow House-passed prisons effort, which Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn has sponsored in the Senate. Groups supporting the effort are counting on Trump's endorsement to help push the deal across the finish line with Republicans, particularly those from deep-red states where the president remains extremely popular.\n\nTrump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, is leading the internal White House efforts in favor of the agreement. The president praised Kushner during Wednesday\u2019s White House event. \u201cHe worked very hard and he feels very deeply about it,\u201d Trump said of his son-in law.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who have taken a leading role in their respective parties in negotiating on the criminal justice package, hailed Trump's remarks Wednesday in a statement that referred to McConnell's vow earlier this year to take up the criminal justice deal if it could win at least 60 votes.\n\n\"With the president\u2019s support and Leader McConnell\u2019s pledge to hold a vote on the broadly popular package, we can quickly take a critical first step towards reforming our criminal justice system,\" Grassley and Durbin said.\n\nThe White House has been in regular contact with McConnell\u2019s office about finding floor time for the bill. A White House official said Trump administration aides initially hoped to move the bill before the election, but McConnell decided to wait until after it was over.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. There are other things that will compete for time on the floor. But I am optimistic that we will clear over 60 votes,\u201d the official said, adding later, \u201cOur goal is to try to get it done as quickly as possible. \u2026 We\u2019re going to push very hard to see if we can bring it home.\u201d\n\nKushner spoke with Cotton on Wednesday ahead of Trump\u2019s endorsement announcement, the White House official said, adding that aides will continue to talk to him. \u201cWe welcome his feedback, but again he\u2019s one vote,\u201d the official said before expressing some hope that the White House can allay some of Cotton\u2019s concerns. \u201cI\u2019d like to figure out to what degree we can get him on board, if that\u2019s possible,\u201d the official said.\n\nAnd one of the measure's most influential backers, Sen. Paul, is joined in his criminal justice advocacy efforts by his wife, Kelley, who visited Capitol Hill on Wednesday to help rally support for the legislation.\n\n\"It would be so important right now, especially in this time of incredible division, to have a bipartisan bill pass that helps people from all walks of life,\" Kelley Paul said in an interview after meeting with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen how comprehensive Democratic support is for the package.

Florida Senate recount set to get first day in federal court\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 Florida\u2019s seemingly never-ending midterm recount saga turns to federal court Wednesday where Sen. Bill Nelson\u2019s uphill fight to stay in office hinges largely on an effort to overturn a state law that could free up \u201cthousands\u201d of additional votes.\n\nThe lawsuit centers on whether a state law requiring that signatures on mail and provisional ballots match those on file with election offices but has expanded beyond a fight over Florida statutes into a fight involving national political groups, former Congress members and the state\u2019s top law enforcement officer.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe legal fight, which will play out this afternoon in Judge Mark Walker\u2019s downtown Tallahassee courtroom, was originally filed by Nelson and the Florida Democratic Party against Secretary of State Ken Detzner, who is the Scott administration\u2019s top election official. Gov. Rick Scott is Nelson\u2019s Republican opponent in Florida\u2019s U.S. Senate race, one of three statewide races in the Sunshine State that is being recounted.\n\nThere is initially a Thursday deadline for counties to finish a machine recount, which also involves Florida\u2019s governor\u2019s race, but there are legal challenges seeking to extend that time frame. Any race that is within .25 percent after the machine recount, whenever it concludes, would then go to a hand recount under Florida law. That could go on for weeks.\n\nAmong the reams of motions filed since the legal challenge was first made public last week are motions to intervene from Republican Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, a Washington-based group that helped Scott\u2018s 2018 Senate campaign against Nelson.\n\n\u201cThe NRSC\u2019s interest is to assure that Florida\u2019s election laws are followed and not rewritten to the prejudice of Scott\u2019s candidacy,\u201d read the NRSC\u2019s motion to intervene, which was granted.\n\nAlong with Florida-based attorney Andy Bardos with the law firm Gray Robinson, the NRSC filing includes attorney Helgi Walker and Thomas Dupree of the Washington-based law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP. The firm\u2019s location is notable because Scott and other Republicans have been hammering Nelson for hiring a \u201cDC lawyer.\u201d His campaign is represented by well-known Democratic election law attorney Marc Elias, who is from the Washington office of Perkins Coie.\n\nElias told reporters that he thought that if the signature match lawsuit was successful, it could \u201cadd thousands of additional ballots that have so far gone uncounted.\u201d That sentiment is at the heart of the simmering partisan fight: Democrats say the Florida law is disenfranchises voters, while Republicans charge that Nelson is trying to change laws through the court after losing an election.\n\nOn the other side, former Democratic Congressman Patrick Murphy has filed an affidavit in support of Nelson. He said publicly last week that his vote-by-mail ballot was rejected because his signature did not match the one that was on file. Florida allows people who have voted by mail to check online to see whether their ballots were accepted. Murphy said in his affidavit that he was \u201csurprised\u201d because he had no problem voting by mail during the August primary.\n\nAhead of the hearing Wednesday, Scott general counsel Dan Nordby told the court that Scott would recuse himself from the Florida Election Canvasing Committee, which is the board that formally signs off on election results. Scott is up by a razor-thin 12,000 vote margin over Nelson in a race that could go to a hand recount, so there had been an open question about whether Scott would continue to play a role in overseeing the election process.\n\nHe had faced pressure from outside groups, including the League of Women Voters of Florida, to recuse himself, but had been silent on the issue until Wednesday morning. He made a similar decision in 2014 when running for reelection.\n\nOn the vote counting front, Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher made waves Tuesday night after telling WPBF television in Palm Beach County that their aged vote counting machines were failing and all 179,000 early votes would need to be recounted.\n\nA Leon County court ruled Tuesday night that the Palm Beach County recount effort should get five days beyond the original Thursday deadline to finish a machine recount, but that ruling was halted by a last-minute move by the state sending it to federal court.\n\nThose recount deadlines are also the subject of another one of the lawsuits filed either by Nelson or Democratic groups. His campaign says that the Thursday deadline for county voters to finish their machine recounts is an arbitrary deadline. If counties don\u2019t meet that deadline, election night results could be used under state law, which Elias argued could disenfranchise untold thousands of voters. Scott led Nelson in the Senate race under initial counts.\n\nOther lawsuits filed by Democrats include a challenge to the state\u2019s vote-by-mail ballot deadlines. The Nelson camp wants state law to include mail ballots that were postmarked before election day which is when they are due, but were not delivered in time through no fault of the voter. On Thursday, Nelson also filed a lawsuit against Bay County over that county\u2019s election chief Mark Andersen not turning over public records quick enough. The Nelson camp was seeking records related to Anderson\u2019s admission that the northwest Florida county, which was devastated by Hurricane Michael, accepted some votes by mail and fax, which is not allowed by state law.\n\nThe onslaught of lawsuits after Election Day have fueled Republicans\u2018 most prominent post-election day talking-point: Nelson wants the courts, not voters, to send him back to the Senate for a fourth term. That was highlighted by veteran GOP election law attorney Charlie Spies during a Wednesday morning CNN interview.\n\n\u201cThis is all trying to change the rules after the fact,\u201d he said.", "Sen.

Much of the funding came from an approximately $1 million transfer supplied from the Republican National Committee last week, before Hyde-Smith\u2019s remarks became public.\n\nThe RNC, which deployed field staffers nationwide ahead of the midterm elections, has had two dozen aides in Mississippi for months, and plans on deploying additional staffers from other states.\n\nParty officials say they remain confident that Hyde-Smith will prevail in the deep red state but want to take no chances, particularly after last year\u2019s embarrassing special election loss for an Alabama Senate seat.\n\nAdditional reinforcements could be on the way. Mississippi Victory Fund, a pro-Hyde Smith super PAC, is expected to invest another $600,000 ahead of the runoff. The group, which is run by Henry Barbour, the nephew of former Gov. Haley Barbour, had spent more than $300,000 through the middle of October, according to Federal Election Commission filings.\n\nNational Democrats, who've long viewed the contest as a reach, are also starting to engage. On Wednesday, the Democratic-aligned Senate Majority PAC began reserving TV advertising time. The group's commercials are set to begin airing later this week, a spokesman confirmed.\n\nAnd this weekend, California Sen. Kamala Harris, who is African American, is slated to campaign with Espy,\n\nHyde-Smith's \"hanging\" remark triggered an outcry, with many pointing to Mississippi's history of lynchings. Nearly 40 percent of the state's population is African-American.\n\nBut Hyde-Smith denied any racial intent.\n\n\"In a comment on Nov. 2, I referred to accepting an invitation to a speaking engagement. In referencing the one who invited me, I used an exaggerated expression of regard, and any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous,\u201d Hyde-Smith said in a statement last weekend. She has refused to elaborate.\n\nWhite House officials were initially disappointed by Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant's decision in March to appoint Hyde-Smith to the seat and warned him that Hyde-Smith's past Democratic affiliation would jeopardize the seat. But the administration soon came around: Trump announced his support for Hyde-Smith in August and flew to Mississippi in October to campaign for her.\n\n", "Shahira Knight, President Donald Trump\u2019s top Hill aide, told a private gathering this week that Republicans should draft one giant spending package in the lame-duck Congress that includes wall funding. | AP Photo/Andrew Harnik White House White House looks to jam Democrats on border cash\n\nWhite House officials are pushing Capitol Hill Republicans to take an all-or-nothing approach to government funding this fall \u2014 daring Democrats to shut down the government rather than fund the border wall.\n\nShahira Knight, President Donald Trump\u2019s top Hill aide, told a private gathering this week that Republicans should draft one giant spending package in the lame-duck Congress that includes wall funding, according to two sources familiar with the conversations.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat package would also include emergency dollars for this year\u2019s deadly wildfires and hurricanes, according to a senior GOP aide.

Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Pompeo during a meeting Tuesday that he would prioritize oversight if he secures the chairmanship post in the next Congress.\n\nThe State Department's nascent proposal reflects the Trump administration's pullback from programs advancing women's reproductive health, especially regarding abortion. Though it's unclear what policy consequences it would have, the proposal would complicate terminology in agreements with the United Nations and other countries regarding public health. The policy could also complicate dealings with non-governmental organizations that continue to use the terms.\n\nAlternative terms haven't been solidified, but POLITICO reported two weeks ago that they would likely exclude the word \"sex.\"\n\nThe State Department has already curated its content in its annual human rights reports by removing language related to women's access to abortion and contraception. Shortly after his inauguration, Trump also moved to reinstate the \"Mexico City policy\", which banned U.S. aid to foreign groups that provide abortions.\n\nWhen he served as a Kansas congressman, Pompeo repeatedly voiced opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion, and he has continued to hold those positions during his time at the State Department.\n\nBut aside from ideological differences, the change in nomenclature would deviate from global health standards, the letter argued. It cited leading health organizations in asserting the necessity for sex education in basic health knowledge and noted the World Health Organization uses and defines the term \"sexual and reproductive health.\"\n\nThe lawmakers said they fear suppressing straightforward terminology would complicate and hinder access to healthcare related to HIV and contraception while also preventing an efficient use of taxpayer dollars.\n\n\"We urge you to reject any policy that censors American diplomats, undermines global health, and threatens the tremendous progress that has been shepherded by U.S. global health assistance,\" the letter said.\n\nThis article tagged under: State Department\n\nMike Pompeo", "Fox News' support of CNN means it is aligned with a news network President Donald Trump has long criticized. | Mary Altaffer/AP photo Trump's relationship with Fox News starts to show cracks The network backed CNN over White House access, just the latest sign of distance between Fox and the president.\n\nFox News said Wednesday it would back CNN in its lawsuit to restore reporter Jim Acosta's press credentials after the White House revoked them last week \u2014 the latest move by President Donald Trump's favorite news organization to distance itself from him in recent weeks.\n\n\"Secret Service passes for White House journalists should never be weaponized,\" Fox News President Jay Wallace said in a statement. \"While we don't condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the President and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people.\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe decision aligned a news network that Trump frequently quotes with one he has long criticized.

Pelosi huddled with the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus and put out a press release promising to work with it on reforms to decentralize power to rank-and-file members. She also met with the Congressional Black Caucus, whose leader, Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), recently floated the idea of having a CBC member challenge her or Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) for the No. 1 or No. 2 position.\n\n\"She\u2019s been very active,\" Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.), a CBC member, said before Fudge revealed she might run for speaker. \"I don\u2019t know where [Pelosi] gets the energy to do all that she\u2019s done. I\u2019m curious as to who thinks that they can rival her. So I\u2019ll be very eager to see who this shadow candidate is.\u201d\n\nThe Pelosi debate also spilled into a Wednesday afternoon caucus meeting, when Democrats discussed the rules changes that Pelosi's critics are seeking. Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.), who opposes Pelosi for speaker, stood to advocate for a proposal that would allow members to vote for whomever they want on the House floor for speaker.\n\nDemocrats are currently bound by caucus rules to vote for whomever wins the nomination for speaker. The nominee is decided behind closed doors in a secret ballot vote, and requires only a simple majority of members to clinch. It's a much lower threshold than is needed on the House floor, where a small number of Democrats could conceivably block Pelosi.\n\nPulling out a copy of the Constitution, Perlmutter argued that such rules go against founding principles of the nation.\n\nBut Rep.-elect Katie Hill of California challenged Perlmutter on why the rule needs to be changed, since it's not enforced anyway. She suggested that Perlmutter was raising the issue to make hay. \"On behalf of the freshman class, I would like for all of us to move forward,\" she said, according to sources in the room.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) then stood to tell the incoming freshmen \u2014 and the rest of the caucus \u2014 that it didn't matter whom they support for speaker \u2014 Republicans will attack them in the next election regardless.\n\nPelosi's critics, meanwhile, have been trying to buck up the incoming freshmen who are considering voting against Pelosi. Rep. Kathleen Rice, a New York Democrat who opposed the Californian on the House floor last year, seethed at the suggestion that incoming freshmen would get in trouble for not backing Pelosi on the House floor should she win the nomination in caucus, which is almost certain.\n\n\"The untenable situation that we are giving all of these new members is saying you either violate the caucus rule and they try to make it seem like there is a consequence to that \u2014 there isn\u2019t\u2026 nothing happened to me \u2014 or you keep your campaign promise,\u201d Rice told reporters.\n\nRice also complained about Pelosi allies trying to frame her bid to reclaim the gavel as an issue of women's empowerment and gender. Pelosi allies have singled out newly elected women, especially, in their pitch to keep a woman in power, according to multiple sources familiar with their efforts.\n\n\u201cThey should not be made to feel that they are \u2018anti-women\u2019 if they don\u2019t want to vote for Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Rice said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair to put all the incoming women in that position, where you\u2019re telling them if you\u2019re not going to support her, you\u2019re basically betraying your gender. That\u2019s just not true. \u2026 They should be treated with more respect.\u201d\n\nA challenge to Pelosi by Fudge would complicate the current leader's pitch to members that they need to keep a woman in power. Fudge could also give lawmakers currently on the fence about Pelosi more comfort voting against her. Currently, rebels have offered no alternative to Pelosi, which has undercut their sway with some members.\n\nThe 66-year-old Fudge was first elected to Congress in 2008. She did stints as a local politician and prosecutor before coming to Capitol Hill. She is regarded in Congress as a tough and smart lawmaker.\n\nWhile Fudge has been mentioned as potential speaker material, she supported fellow Ohioan Ryan for minority leader over Pelosi in 2016. She has also talked up South Carolina Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American lawmaker in Congress, for the top post.\n\nThe entire Pelosi debate is clearly making some freshmen uncomfortable. Reps.-Elect Elissa Slotkin and Abigail Spanberger exited the caucus meeting together and bemoaned the constant questions and calls and texts about Pelosi. Jennifer Wexton, who beat Virginia Republican Barbara Comstock last week, repeatedly dodged questions from reporters about how she'd vote on Pelosi, only to later tweet her support for the leader.\n\n\"I look forward to talking to my colleagues in caucus about that,\" she told reporters. \"I know that Leader Pelosi has been the leader for many, many years and has accomplished many, many things.\"\n\nRep.-elect Susan Wild of Pennsylvania \u2014 who said she's been receiving a regular stream of texts, emails and phone calls from people regarding leadership elections \u2014 said it's important that top Democrats lay out a plan of succession before members vote. Pelosi, Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn are all in their 70s and have been leading the caucus for more than 15 years.\n\n\"I think it\u2018s very important that there be a succession plan in place if [Pelosi] is elected so that we are grooming people for leadership who are as diverse as this incoming freshman class is,\" Wild said.\n\nPelosi this week has been deploying all her political power to lobby incoming lawmakers for support \u2014 tapping outside groups with deep pockets and Democratic leaders from John Kerry and Al Gore to governors of their respective states to make her case.\n\nOn Wednesday, a swath of labor groups endorsed Pelosi, adding their names to a long list of women's groups, progressive groups and other organizations that have joined Pelosi's show-of-force pressure campaign. Her allies in Congress have been sending around letters to colleagues and disseminated press releases backing her as well.\n\nPelosi's critics have been trying to persuade many incoming freshmen to stick to their campaign promises to vote for new leadership, a commitment they made after being attacked by Republicans as being \u201cPelosi puppets.\" They hope to release the letter signed by those committed to voting against her on the floor, showing that they have the numbers to take Pelosi out and usher in an alternative.\n\nBut Pelosi allies have convinced several incoming freshmen not to sign on to the rebels' letter, cautioning them that such antics could land them in trouble with leadership and start them off on the wrong foot.\n\nStill, the margin for Pelosi could be close.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a\" slam dunk for Pelosi, said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.). \"The math is what it is.

But the arguments Wednesday represented a significant escalation in Trump\u2019s fight against the media, with more than a dozen news organizations, including POLITICO, weighing in on CNN\u2019s side.\n\nTrump has long argued that coverage of his administration is unfair, and CNN has been a favorite target. Even before he took office, the president referred to Acosta as \u201cfake news\u201d at a press conference and refused to take questions from him. The White House also has substantially curtailed the number of briefings by press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\nBut reporters have retained access to the White House and traveled with the president, and before last week, revoking a journalist\u2019s hard pass \u2014 the badge that lets them enter and exit the complex freely \u2014 was virtually unheard-of.\n\nThe White House said last Wednesday it was pulling Acosta\u2019s access after he repeatedly tried to ask Trump questions at a press conference, even after the president dismissed him, and briefly refused to let a White House aide pull a microphone out of his hand. CNN on Tuesday asked a judge to temporarily restore Acosta's credentials and declare that the administration's actions were unconstitutional, saying Trump was punishing the network for its coverage of him and not for any action on Acosta\u2019s part.\n\nTed Boutrous of Gibson and Dunn, who represented CNN and Acosta, said Wednesday that the White House\u2019s decision was \u201cpart of a campaign\u201d against Acosta, citing previous tweets and incidents in which Trump had insulted the reporter. He said under the White House\u2019s logic, the president could bar reporters for any reason, including a \u201cfit of pique.\u201d\n\nHe also argued that Acosta, who was present for the hearing, was not afforded \u201cdue process\u201d because he was not told his pass would be revoked beforehand or given a way to appeal the decision before he was prevented from entering White House grounds. He requested a two-week preliminary return of Acosta\u2019s pass while the process moved forward.\n\nA 1977 D.C. Circuit court ruling held that the government cannot deny a White House hard pass \u201carbitrarily or for less than compelling reasons\u201d and must follow a clear process to do it. Kelly noted during the hearing that he would be bound by that court\u2019s decision in issuing a ruling, and Boutrous cited the case repeatedly in his arguments.\n\nBurnham, arguing for the White House, acknowledged that the administration had dropped its initial argument against Acosta: That he had inappropriately touched a White House aide who tried to take a microphone away from him at the press conference.\n\nBut he said Acosta\u2019s behavior at the press conference still justified his expulsion, saying his repeated attempts to question the president after Trump tried to move on were \u201cdisruptive.\u201d And in response to questions from Kelly, he said the administration would be justified in pulling a hard pass because of disputes over reporting, saying barring a reporter from a press conference was no different than refusing to grant them a private interview.\n\nBurnham conceded that he did not know who in the administration made the actual decision to strip Acosta of his press pass \u2014 it was announced on Twitter by Sanders \u2014 and said it did not matter that there are no set-out or written standards governing reporter behavior in the White House. Boutros seized on those points to argue that Acosta was not afforded due process.\n\nKelly, a Trump appointee, seemed skeptical of some of CNN's arguments and appeared to agree that Acosta had been disruptive at the press conference. Boutrous responded that Trump set a tone of rudeness. \u201cHe is the most aggressive, dare I say rude, person in the room,\u201d Boutros said. \u201c[If] President Trump wants it to be a free-for-all, that\u2019s his prerogative.\u201d\n\nThe White House argued in its legal filing Wednesday that because it has granted hard passes to many other CNN employees, the network cannot say its coverage led to Acosta\u2019s expulsion. The 28-page document mentioned six times that 50 CNN employees have hard passes. Boutrous pointed out that most of those employees are technicians and photographers, part of the large staff a TV network maintains to cover events live at the White House.\n\nReporters have denounced the decision to pull Acosta's access. Thirteen news organizations including Fox News, NBC and POLITICO announced Wednesday they would file amicus briefs supporting CNN's lawsuit.\n\n\"It is imperative that independent journalists have access to the President and his activities, and that journalists are not barred for arbitrary reasons. Our news organizations support the fundamental constitutional right to question this President, or any President,\" a joint statement from the news organizations said.\n\nMeanwhile, on CNN, coverage appeared to be business-as-usual Wednesday.\n\nCNN White House reporters Jeff Zeleny and Kaitlan Collins reported live from outside the White House on the latest West Wing personnel turmoil, neither of them mentioning the court hearing playing out across the town.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, we\u2019re compartmentalizing our coverage,\u201d a CNN source told POLITICO. White House reporters will continue focusing on what\u2019s happening at the White House, this person said, while other CNN journalists cover the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States is the most important person we cover,\u201d the source added. \u201cWe will cover the president as we always have.

But the network did turn to chief media correspondent Brian Stelter for updates and Jeffrey Toobin for analysis on the court proceedings.\n\nWhite House officials, meanwhile, have largely been tight-lipped about the lawsuit, although Trump told the Daily Caller in an interview published Wednesday that Acosta was \u201cbad for the country.\u201d\n\nAnd the president\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign sent out a fundraising email asking recipients whether they think the White House made the right decision to revoke Acosta\u2019s pass.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump will NOT put up with the media\u2019s liberal bias and utter disrespect for this Administration and the hardworking Americans who stand with us,\u201d the email read.\n\nMatthew Choi contributed to this report.\n\n\n\nCORRECTION: The title of Deputy Assistant Attorney General James Burnham was incorrect in an earlier version of this article.", "Matthew Whitaker was previously chief of staff to now-ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u2014 a job that didn\u2019t require Senate confirmation. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Legal DOJ defends Trump\u2019s acting A.G. appointment in memo The 20-page DOJ memo leans heavily on historical precedent to argue that Trump was well within his constitutional and legal bounds.\n\nA new Justice Department analysis released Wednesday backs up President Donald Trump\u2019s appointment last week of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker despite a growing political and legal backlash.\n\nThe 20-page DOJ memo \u2014 addressed to top White House attorney Emmet Flood \u2014 leans heavily on historical precedent to argue that Trump was well within his constitutional and legal bounds to elevate Whitaker over other senior Justice officials as the temporary replacement for ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhitaker, a former federal prosecutor who was working as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff before getting the promotion to become the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official, has already drawn lawsuits and congressional scrutiny over his conflicts of interest and because he hasn\u2019t been confirmed for any current Justice position.\n\nBut Steven Engel, the head of DOJ\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, argued in the new memo that the Justice Department has previously leaned on the same law Trump used \u2014 the Vacancies Reform Act \u2014 to depart from its own succession plans.\n\nIn addition, Engel pushed back against suggestions Trump violated the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause by noting that someone who performs the duties in a temporary capacity doesn\u2019t have to go through the Senate confirmation process.\n\n\u201cAs all three branches of government have long recognized, the President may designate an acting official to perform the duties of a vacant principal office, including a Cabinet office, even when the acting official has not been confirmed by the Senate,\u201d wrote Engel.\n\nDrawing on U.S. history, Engel explained that presidents have had the legal right to put non-Senate confirmed officials into government positions going as far back as 1792. That includes more than 160 appointments before 1860 for positions that included secretaries of State, Treasury, War, Navy and Interior.\n\nDOJ also found an example from 1866 when a non-Senate confirmed assistant attorney general took over as acting attorney general.\n\n\u201cMr. Whitaker\u2019s designation is no more constitutionally problematic than countless similar presidential orders dating back over 200 years,\u201d Engel wrote.\n\nWhile much of the Justice Department memo is devoted to the long history of similar appointments, the Supreme Court has sometimes scoffed at such arguments when the justices conclude that such practices fly in the face of the Constitution.\n\nIn 2012, the Justice Department issued a similar legal opinion justifying three of President Barack Obama's appointments to the National Labor Relations Board. And in 2014, the justices unanimously ruled those appointments unconstitutional. However, they appeared divided on how much deference to give to tradition in such disputes.\n\nComplaints about Whitaker have only grown since Trump last week tapped Whitaker the day after the November mid-term elections where Democrats won control of the House. Already, the state of Maryland has filed a motion Tuesday in federal court seeking to overturn the Whitaker appointment. Incoming House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler has said Whitaker would be his first witness when Democrats take control of the lower chamber in January.\n\nIn promoting Whitaker, Trump has also sparked an uproar because of his past criticism of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation examining any potential conspiracy between Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.\n\nWhitaker in his new role has taken over supervising duties of Mueller\u2019s work from Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who was in charge of the special counsel because Sessions had previously recused himself from the topic.\n\nDOJ initially said Whitaker had no plans to back away from overseeing Mueller, but on Monday it signaled the acting attorney general was consulting with senior DOJ ethics officials and reopened the possibility he could recuse himself.\n\nJosh Gerstein contributed to this report.", "Sen.

The Texas Republican is planning to soon circulate draft legislation to fix the \"retail glitch\" and other hiccups in the new tax law, along with a tax extenders package, our Aaron Lorenzo reports. It could be House Republicans' last tax hurrah before slipping into the minority next year.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTax pros and those affected by the retail glitch have been waiting for months to see if Republicans would put forward a technical corrections bill for the tax law, H.R. 1 (115). Of course, retailers and restaurant owners consider their problem to be more than just technical. The glitch requires them to write off certain investments over decades, rather than over one year as Republicans intended. Brady said his legislation will include 70 to 80 other alterations to the law, the vast majority of which he characterized as very minor clarifications, Aaron wrote. \"Again, we'll see what appetite there is to pass some or the bulk of them before the end of the year,\" Brady said.\n\nThe second piece of legislation includes a group of tax incentives with expiration dates that didn't make it into 2015 legislation that made dozens of other extenders permanent. \"We have developed a draft package approach on the temporary measures that we're going to visit with our members about, Ranking Member [Richard] Neal and the Senate as well,\" Brady told reporters.

But the company\u2019s decision to split the HQ, and its 50,000 jobs, between Arlington\u2019s Crystal City and Long Island City in Queens has pulled the veil back a bit. To wit: The state of New York will provide $1.2 billion in tax credits and a $325 million capital grant; the company also plans to apply for up to $1 billion in other incentives through NYC programs, POLITICO New York\u2019s Dana Rubinstein reported. In Virginia, state and county officials will fork over $573 million in cash grants, the Technology team\u2019s Steven Overly reported. Tennessee will provide a $21.7 million tax credit to offset franchise and excise taxes for an \"Operations Center of Excellence\" in Nashville, the company said in a blog post announcing the deals.\n\nThe tax incentive offered by New York will come in the form of a refundable tax credit \"calculated as a percentage of the salaries Amazon expects to pay employees over the next 10 years, which equates to $48,000 per job for 25,000 jobs with an average wage of over $150,000,\" Amazon said. Arlington's cash grant will come from expected growth in revenue from its hotel room tax. The city will also \"dedicate an estimated $28 million based on 12% of future property tax revenues earned from an existing Tax Increment Financing (TIF) district for on-site infrastructure and open space\" in Crystal City, Amazon said. The company offered no explanation for the wide difference in incentives between the two cities, though it presumably has to do with higher taxes and other expenses in New York City.\n\nWhile New York and Virginia officials hailed Amazon\u2019s decision as an economic coup for their regions, naysayers came out of the woodwork. \u201cThe arrangements have drawn the ire of Amazon critics including incoming Rep.

You heard of Coinbase? Watch where we\u2019re headed,\u201d he said at the AICPA National Tax Conference. His comments seemed at least partly motivated by a demand from some House Ways and Means Republicans, including Brady, that the agency release updated guidance on how tax law applies to cryptocurrencies.

The better question now: How long will it take them to reach me?\u201d writes Tom Randall. Another key question: Will Congress be able to catch up? Our Tanya Snyder wrote earlier this week that there\u2019s pressure on the Senate to agree on a federal legislative framework for self-driving cars before the next Congress, and Waymo\u2019s progress will add another reason to get a bill done.\n\nSpeaking of which: Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) said Tuesday that the fate of that bill, S. 1885 (115), will \u201cdepend entirely on the Democrats, coming out of the election, whether or not they want to get a deal.\u201d There are \u201ca couple of discrete issues where we haven\u2019t been able to close the deal out,\u201d Thune said. \u201cBut I think that if we can get consent to move something, I think it\u2019s still possible to get it done. It would be really good if we did \u2014 the technology\u2019s moving fast.\u201d In response to a reporter\u2019s question, Thune said the legislation could ride on a spending measure \u2014 \u201cif we can get an agreement.\u201d\n\nAviation\n\nBOEING PROBE RAMPS UP: The FAA launched an investigation of Boeing\u2019s safety analyses Tuesday, as part of the agency\u2019s response to the deadly Lion Air crash in October. Investigators suspect that problems with a new automated flight-control system, which is part of the the company\u2019s new 737 MAX models, may have played a role in the crash. The Wall Street Journal reports that FAA is reviewing details of the safety data and conclusions that Boeing had previously provided to the agency, as well as looking into training requirements for pilots.\n\nHill reaction: DeFazio told MT that he hasn\u2019t been briefed by his staff yet, but is watching the story, which he said is a \u201cvery, very serious concern. Whenever you have the potential for a design flaw failure, that\u2019s something we\u2019ve got to get on right away.\u201d\n\nTURKEY DAY TRAVEL UPDATE: Stephanie reported Tuesday that TSA is gearing up for a potentially record-breaking level of Thanksgiving holiday travel by adding new screening technology and implementing a contentious canine screening program. The agency is using automated screening lanes, 3D computed tomography scanners and ID authentication tech, and adding 1,200 agents and 80 canine teams. Pekoske said the agency will also continue to use expedited canine screening, which has been criticized by lawmakers, at least through the end of the year.

European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m meets with U.S. Trade Representative Robert LIghthizer today and hopes Trump keeps his promise of keeping auto tariffs at bay. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission wants the U.S. to step up its fight against China at the WTO. Start here:\n\nTHE WINDING ROAD TO THE G-20: Trump\u2019s strategy ahead of a high-stakes meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping is about as clear as mud, but there has been some work behind the scenes. Trump met last Thursday with his envoy to Beijing, Terry Branstad, as well as Lighthizer, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and chief of staff John Kelly. The meeting was supposed to map out the best way to talk to China about national security and trade, said a source briefed on the meeting.\n\nThe White House wants to \u201cpush the Chinese to where they need to get in order to make a deal,\u201d the source said about the upcoming meeting, and thinks China is ready to do that now that Republicans showed they could maintain control of the Senate.\n\nThe Mnuchin angle: It\u2019s still unclear what Trump wants to get out of Xi during the face-to-face, but China watchers say they are wary of news that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin could meet in the coming weeks with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He ahead of the G-20 meeting. As of Friday, USTR had not been involved in the planning of that meeting, said one source familiar with the planning. Even at Treasury, staff-level China experts haven\u2019t been involved in planning for a potential meeting or preparation for the G-20 get together, according to two sources close to the process.\n\n\u201cIf USTR is not involved, then we have the same problem as before,\u201d said one of the sources, referring to a failed effort to reach a deal in May that was led by Mnuchin. Hardliners fear that another effort with Mnuchin at the helm could lead to an outcome that doesn\u2019t pressure Beijing to address substantive issues related to China\u2019s intellectual property and technology transfer policies.\n\nIT'S WEDNESDAY, NOV. 14! Welcome to Morning Trade, where your host is hoping to catch the meteor shower this weekend. Got any trade wishes you want to see come true?

Kicking things off will be Nelson Mullins partner and former U.S. Ambassador to Canada David Wilkins. Get the details and sign up.\n\nKUDLOW UNLEASHES ON NAVARRO\u2019S CHINA COMMENTS: As if we weren\u2019t confused enough about what message the administration is trying to send to China ahead of the meeting between Trump and Xi, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said White House trade adviser Peter Navarro did the president a \u201cgreat disservice\u201d in his remarks last Friday.\n\n\u201cHe was not speaking for the president, nor was he speaking for the administration. His remarks were way off base. They were not authorized by anybody,\u201d Kudlow said on CNBC on Tuesday.\n\nNavarro had said there would be a \u201cstench\u201d around any deal that involves the influence of Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street players. Kudlow said the president \u201ccan talk to whomever he can talk to. He talks to people on Wall Street, yes.\u201d\n\nKudlow added that \u201cwe\u2019re having communications at all levels of U.S. and Chinese government.\u201d\n\nKoch groups weigh in on G-20: The Koch network of free trade groups are urging Trump and Xi to end the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. In a letter released this morning, Americans for Prosperity, Freedom Partners and The Libre Initiative called for dropping the tariffs, which they say have hurt the global economy.\n\nNO CAR TARIFFS YET; MALMSTR\u00d6M STILL EXPECTS EU REPRIEVE: The Commerce Department is still working on its report on whether imports of autos and auto part imports threaten national security, according to a senior administration official \u2014 but when it recommends tariffs as expected, European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m wants the U.S. to keep its promise to spare the EU.\n\n\u201cWe assume if that were to happen, that would not be for the European Union,\u201d Malmstr\u00f6m said Tuesday in remarks at the German Marshall Fund.\n\nCommerce\u2019s Section 232 investigation could allow Trump to impose 20 percent or 25 percent duties on auto and auto part imports.\n\nMalmstr\u00f6m is halfway through a two-day trip to the United States to discuss the parameters of future negotiations. Malmstr\u00f6m will meet with Lighthizer today. Doug has more here.\n\nCHINA COMMISSION URGES NEW FIGHT AT WTO: The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission is encouraging Congress to step up the fight against China\u2019s trade practices in its annual report to Congress today.\n\nTop among 26 recommendations is that lawmakers urge the administration to pursue a rarely invoked \u201cnon-violation nullification or impairment\" case against Beijing at the WTO. That type of case would allow countries to challenge China for economic practices that don\u2019t violate specific WTO rules but prevent Beijing from meeting its obligation to maintain a open and market-oriented economy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear [President Xi Jinping] and the Chinese communist party have taken control of the economy and not necessarily in the most healthy or productive way,\u201d commission Chairwoman Robin Cleveland told reporters Tuesday. Read the full story here.\n\nHOW THE CHINA TRADE FIGHT COULD GET EVEN WORSE: Consumers have not yet felt a major hit from Trump\u2019s trade battle with China, but that could change later this year if the countries cannot make a deal. In the latest POLITICO Money podcast, our Doug Palmer explains the potential for Trump to hit more than $500 billion in Chinese imports with tariffs as high as 25 percent over the coming months.\n\nU.S. COUNTER-NOTIFIES AT THE WTO: The U.S. called out India at the WTO for underreporting the extent of its market price support for cotton. The move, known as a \u201ccounter notification,\u201d is part of a broader effort by the U.S. to pressure WTO members to fully disclose subsidies and other domestic measures that affect trade. The U.S. calculated that India\u2019s cotton support program exceeded its allowable threshold for trade-distorting domestic support.\n\nFRUSTRATION MOUNTS OVER TARIFF EXCLUSION \u2018MESS\u2019: The Commerce Department\u2019s tariff exclusion process was meant to ease the burden on U.S. companies that rely on imports, but the Aluminum Association is arguing that even after proposed reforms, the complicated operation is only making things worse.\n\n\"The inherent uncertainty of the product exclusion process is actually adding an unnecessarily prolonged cost burden to our members and their customers and chilling investment in the aluminum industry, rather than promoting domestic production,\" the group said in a letter sent Tuesday to Commerce Department officials.\n\nLauren Wilk, vice president for policy at the Aluminum Association, added in an interview: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a mess.\u201d Doug has more for Pros here.\n\nTRADE STAFF SWITCH-UP AT FINANCE: Nasim Fussell will take over as chief international trade counsel for Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee. She was previously deputy chief trade counsel on the committee. Shane Warren, who fills the top trade staffer position, will be leaving after five years on the panel, a Finance spokeswoman told Morning Trade.\n\nFussell joined the committee earlier this year after working as director of government and regulatory affairs at Pitney Bowes, a mailing equipment and services company. She also served as a trade counsel on the House Ways and Means Committee, working under the chairmanships of Dave Camp (R-Mich.), Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Kevin Brady (R-Texas). During her time on the House panel, she worked to advance trade promotion authority, customs, trade preferences and miscellaneous tariff bill legislation.\n\nChairman question mark: Sen. Chuck Grassley is still on the short list of lawmakers who could take the Finance chairmanship when Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) leaves Congress after this term. But the Iowa Republican said he needs more time to discuss the possible move with his colleagues. To take the top spot on Finance, Grassley would have to give up the gavel to the Judiciary Committee.\n\n\u201cYou ask me that in a few days and I\u2019ll have an answer for you,\u201d Grassley told reporters on Tuesday. POLITICO\u2019s Burgess Everett has more here on the committee scene in next year\u2019s Senate.\n\nAFTER TARIFFS, SPANISH OLIVE IMPORTS DROP 72 PERCENT: Imports of Spanish table olives to the U.S. dropped by nearly three-quarters in August and September, the first two months after anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duties went into effect, the Spanish olive farmers association ASAMESA said Tuesday.\n\nFollowing a complaint from Californian olive producers, which claimed their Spanish competitors benefited from unfair subsidies, Washington in July imposed hefty tariffs ranging from 30 percent to 45 percent on Spanish table olives. Madrid and the European Commission strongly reject the justification for those duties.\n\nBrussels still in talks: The European Commission said Tuesday it continues to raise the issue with U.S. authorities \u2014 including during Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\u2019 visit to Brussels last month \u2014 but has not yet decided whether it would launch a WTO case.\n\nINTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT\n\n\u2014 Vice President Mike Pence says Trump is leaving the door open to making a deal with Xi at the G-20, if the Chinese president agrees to massive economic, political and military changes, a Washington Post columnist writes.\n\n\u2014 Vietnam becomes the seventh country to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Reuters reports.\n\n\u2014 Deputy White House national security adviser Mira Ricardel will soon be dismissed from her job, CNN reports.\n\n\u2014 The United Kingdom and EU have agreed on the draft text of a Brexit agreement, the BBC reports.\n\nTHAT'S ALL FOR MORNING TRADE!

The program\u2019s acting chief medical officer, Laura Kroupa, technology officer John Short and Travis Dalton from Cerner are also on the menu.\n\nIn a letter last month, subcommittee chair Jim Banks jabbed at the VA\u2019s apparent failure to move forward its Lighthouse EHR modernization project, which was underway before the Cerner decision and includes the creation of an open API gateway.\n\nIf you\u2019ll recall, leading health systems signed an API pledge with the VA at HIMSS in March, but some of those companies are reportedly grumbling that the VA\u2019s work on the project appears dormant. The pledge calls for speeding the mapping of health data to industry standards using FHIR.\n\nWe asked former White House Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra, a big proponent of the open API push, about these concerns, but Chopra wasn\u2019t worried about the delay, given leadership changes at the VA. \u201cThe whole idea of an API gateway is new to health care,\u201d he said.\n\nThe VA\u2019s tech chops have been under close scrutiny of late: earlier this week, NBC News reported that veterans nationwide are suffering from software glitches delaying payment of their benefits.\n\n(For what it\u2019s worth, department secretary Robert Wilkie declared the VA crisis \u201cover\u201d last Friday.)\n\n\u2014 HITAC meeting postponed: Meanwhile, the Health IT Advisory Committee meeting originally scheduled for today has been postponed. Office spokesman Peter Ashkenaz tells Morning eHealth that the committee\u2019s next hearing will be in December, though without a settled date.\n\nThe reason for the postponement? Ashkenaz says that the interoperability standards priorities task force isn\u2019t ready to present its final recommendations.\n\nMeanwhile, committee member Steven Lane tells us the office is gearing up for a rule drop \u2014 presumably the interoperability or info blocking rules currently parked in the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s review process \u2014 which might be part of the agenda for a HITAC meeting.

A lot of them touch on eHealth. The Association is calling on the government and payors to collect demographic data reflecting a variety of sexual and gender identities; it\u2019s hoping to encourage physicians to educate themselves in population and public health for patients without good access to care; and it\u2019s calling for expansion of broadband and wireless to undeserved areas to promote digital health.\n\nHEALTH IT BUSINESS WATCH\n\nWe\u2019ve got a heaping helping of business news to serve up:\n\n\u2014 Q&A with Munjal Shah: Getting health-conscious people better deals on life insurance is the business model for startup Health IQ. In a conversation with our colleague Arthur Allen, CEO Munjal Shah says that a 30-question quiz can help sort out health-knowledgeable from health-na\u00efve consumers, and get the former group some nice quotes on life insurance.\n\n\u201cPeople do a lot for savings. People do a lot of things to save money,\u201d he said. Pros can get the rest here.\n\n\u2014 Alphabet re-orgs health work: Alphabet is reshuffling the org chart for its health care companies, CNBC\u2019s Christina Farr reports. The company is moving the health parts of its DeepMind subsidiary into its Google Health unit. (Here\u2019s more detail in the firm\u2019s blog.) Notably, the firm is pledging that data gathered as part of its partnership with Britain\u2019s NHS won\u2019t be used \u201cfor commercial purposes like advertising or insurance.\u201d (An early partnership had led to an uproar from British lawmakers and the public. They feared the potential damages to privacy.)\n\n\u2014 Oscar sues Florida Blue: Buzzy insurance startup Oscar Health is entering a court battle. The company filed a lawsuit against Florida Blue Cross and Blue Shield Tuesday. The suit alleges that 190 brokers backed out of agreements to sell Oscar\u2019s insurance plans, prompted by Florida Blue\u2019s threats.\n\n\"Florida Blue's monopoly power in Florida makes its scheme devastating to a new entrant like Oscar, as well as deeply injurious to Florida consumers,\" according to the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida.\n\nFlorida Blue said it's reviewing the complaint but \"from what we know of the New York company's grievances, there is no merit to them at all.\" Contracted agents are independent and can choose whether to work with carriers that operate on an exclusive basis, Florida Blue says. You can read the complaint here, and our colleague Paul Demko\u2019s write-up of the legal tactics here.\n\n\u2014 Virta Health makes big bet on new biz model: Virta Health \u2014 a company that hopes to reverse type 2 diabetes through diet change \u2014 is announcing a new payment model: 100% of its fees are at risk, the startup is announcing today.\n\n\u201cNow that we have both clinical trial and commercial results demonstrating diabetes reversal and cost savings at scale, we are ready to align our economic incentives with those of patients and payers by putting 100 percent of our fees at risk,\u201d said the startup\u2019s co-founder, Sami Inkinen. \u201cI am hopeful that the rest of the healthcare industry will follow and transition away from fee-for-service based health care.\u201d\n\nThe company estimates it can save payors nearly $10,000 per patient over the first two years.\n\n\u2014 Facebook answers on privacy: In answers to the Senate Intelligence Committee for a hearing on operatives\u2019 use of social media to influence debate in America, Facebook admitted that users do not have the ability to opt out of research conducted on them.\n\n\u201cIn our Data Policy, we explain that we may use the information we have to conduct and support research in areas that may include general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health, and well-being,\u201d the letter says. \u201cResearchers are subject to strict restrictions regarding data access and use as part of these collaborations.\u201d\n\nThe hearing comes amid a climate of hot controversy over tech firms\u2019 privacy practices. Legislators from both sides of the aisle have at least publicly said they\u2019re interested in a national privacy bill that might affect health care.\n\nIN THE COURTS\n\nTRUMP TO NOMINATE OIRA CHIEF TO FEDERAL JUDGESHIP: President Trump is nominating Neomi Rao, the head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, to Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s old seat on the DC Circuit, he announced Tuesday.

Participation in the food stamp program by eligible immigrant families rose to 43 percent in 2007-2017 before declining in 2018 to 34.8 percent. Heated immigration rhetoric and increased enforcement and detention are \u201ca likely reason for many people dropping out,\u201d Allison Bovell-Ammon, lead researcher on the study, told Evich (though she conceded that \u201cit could also be because the economy is improving.\u201d) Ellen Vollinger, legal/SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center, a D.C. nonprofit, said: \u201cI think this data really does confirm these anecdotes we've been hearing.\u201d More from POLITICO\u2019s Helena Bottemiller Evich here.\n\nGOOD MORNING!

The contract includes a 14 percent pay increase over four years and increases retirement benefits for 16,000 workers, according to the union.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, workers recognized that the steel industry was struggling and agreed to make sacrifices so that U.S. Steel could get through some tough times,\u201d United Steelworkers President Leo Gerard said in a statement. \"Now that the company has recovered and is projected to earn nearly $2 billion this year, workers rightly wanted a share of that success.\"\n\nThe raise doesn\u2019t come close to absorbing the bulk of new profits reported by U.S. Steel. This month, the company reported third-quarter earnings double those in 2017 \u2014 $291 million compared to $147 million, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.\n\nUSW this month reached a tentative agreement with ArcelorMittal, which together with U.S. Steel accounts for 40 percent of the country's flat-rolled steel production.

But there\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll even show for the much-anticipated testimony \u2014 the agenda includes a warning he may be unwilling to participate. Details of the agenda here. Watch the meetings live.\n\n\u2014 Tuesday\u2019s testimony revealed numerous missed warning signs about the Parkland shooter, including that he threatened on multiple occasions to commit a school shooting, made specific threats against black and Jewish people and brought knives, bullets and decapitated animals to school. Most of these incidents, which involved classmates, went unreported until law enforcement began investigating the Feb. 14 massacre. Commissioners implored people to report potential threats instead of brushing them off. More from POLITICO Florida\u2019s Andrew Atterbury.\n\n\u2014 The panel is holding a marathon meeting this week. The four-day session comes after Hurricane Michael canceled the commission\u2019s October meeting. The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission, created by a bill signed by Republican Gov. Rick Scott in March, has only one more scheduled gathering before its recommendations for improving school safety and security are due to state lawmakers on Jan.1. Andrew has more.\n\n\u2014 The commissioners \u2014 who include parents who lost children in the shooting \u2014 will hear other difficult testimony this week, including about security measures at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the shooter\u2019s internet searches and cell phone content, 911 calls, radio transmissions as the tragedy unfolded, and the FBI\u2019s review of the shooting. Broward County officials, including Superintendent Robert Runcie and Sheriff Scott Israel are also expected to testify on Thursday.\n\nGOOD WEDNESDAY MORNING, NOV. 14.

Half of the Cabinet officials comprising the White House school safety commission may soon be gone. President Donald Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions last week and is reportedly looking to remove Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\n\u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos chairs the Federal School Safety Commission \u2014 which the White House launched earlier this year in response to the Parkland shooting. HHS Secretary Alex Azar is also a member. Senior agency officials have participated in the commission\u2019s meetings when Cabinet officials have been unavailable. The panel is expected to produce a report detailing its recommendations by year\u2019s end.\n\n\u2014 Advocates expect that report to address controversial issues like arming teachers and school discipline, in addition to student data sharing and privacy, school building security, and mental health. Conservatives are hoping the commission scraps Obama-era guidelines on school discipline, which they see as a burden on school districts and possibly dangerous because of their potential to keep violent children in school. The guidelines were issued in 2014 with the goal of ensuring that schools aren\u2019t discriminating against students while disciplining them.\n\n\u2014 In other school safety news: Frank Brogan, who leads the Education Department\u2019s Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, will update state education leaders about the commission\u2019s progress. Brogan will speak today at an annual policy forum hosted by the Council of Chief State School Officers, an organization that represents state education chiefs nationwide. The forum is in Long Beach, Calif., and Brogan is expected to speak at 11 a.m. local time.\n\nELECTION WATCH\n\nOJEDA FOR PRESIDENT: West Virginia state legislator Richard Ojeda \u2014 a passionate supporter of striking state teachers earlier this year \u2014 has announced he\u2019s running for president only days after losing his bid for West Virginia\u2019s 3rd District.

Bipartisan pressure has been building on the VA to fix the IT-related problems.\n\n\u2014 \u201cThis is an unnecessary and preventable crisis, and the Department of Veterans Affairs must take immediate action to remedy it,\u201d House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said Tuesday in a statement.\n\n\u2014 Paul R. Lawrence, the undersecretary for benefits in the VA\u2019s Veterans Benefit Administration, is among the officials expected to speak at the hearing, which starts at 4 p.m. in 334 Cannon.\n\n\u2014 Meanwhile, the group Veterans Education Success plans to release an issue brief today that explores why selective colleges enroll far fewer veterans pursuing undergraduate degrees than graduate-level programs. The brief will be released at a College Board conference in Arlington, Va., focused on improving college opportunities for veterans.\n\nVIRGINIA TECH TO OPEN NORTHERN VIRGINIA CAMPUS NEAR AMAZON SITE: Virginia Tech says it will build a 1-million-square-foot campus in Alexandria, Va., that will complement Amazon's new headquarters site. The $1 billion project will focus on providing graduate degree programs and research opportunities in computer sciences and software engineering.\n\n\u2014 Virginia Tech President Tim Sands told Morning Education the idea to build an innovation campus had been in the works for about four years. But when the possibility of Amazon building a second headquarters in the region came under discussion, school officials accelerated that effort.\n\n\u2014 \u201cWhen Amazon and the state came calling about 14 months ago, and asked us to help lead a higher education package that would provide the talent resources that a company like Amazon and any company would need, we stepped right up and said that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on right now,\u2019\u201d Sands said. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll just dovetail this into our plans.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Meanwhile, Jennifer Wexton, the Democrat who last week defeated Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock to represent Virginia\u2019s 10th District, raised concerns about whether Northern Virginia has \u201cthe necessary infrastructure, including roads, transit, schools and affordable housing, to properly welcome Amazon to our region.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Amazon is building a second HQ in Long Island City, New York. One Democratic state lawmaker wants to halt the flow of any taxpayer money to the retail giant. \u201cDemocratic Assemblyman Ron Kim announced that he will introduce legislation to slash New York\u2019s economic development subsidies and use the money to buy up and cancel student debt \u2014 a move he said would provide a bigger boost to the state\u2019s economy,\u201d Capital & Main reports.\n\n\u2014 Chalkbeat looks at how Amazon\u2019s arrival could impact students in New York.\n\nDEVOS SUED OVER LOAN DISCHARGES FOR STUDENTS AT CLOSED SCHOOLS: A California consumer advocacy group on Tuesday sued DeVos for failing to automatically cancel the federal loans owed by students whose education was interrupted by the sudden closure of their colleges.

There has been no shortage of reports urging massive changes to the internet ecosystem, but Altabef said the cyber moonshot was \u201cfundamentally different.\u201d\n\nOne thing that distinguishes the moonshot, according to Altabef, is its focus on interdependencies in networked technology. \u201cI don\u2019t think that has been done before,\u201d he said. \u201cMost cybersecurity efforts are near-term, interim, and relatively piecemeal.\u201d He also argued that the report\u2019s tight recommended timeframe would spur action. \u201cThis is a 10-year effort, but it is also a six-month effort and a one-year effort,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s urgency to this. It is not all \u2018wake up in 10 years and it\u2019s fixed.\u2019 We expect significant things to be happening during this process.\u201d\n\nThe moonshot report is the product of more than a year of effort by a subcommittee of the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, whose members have kept in close touch with officials at DHS and other agencies. \u201cWe are working in this effort with various parts of the administration very, very well,\u201d Altabef said, describing officials as \u201cvery supportive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of at a watershed moment,\u201d said Altabef, who argued that the U.S. had to yet experience a \u201cSputnik moment\u201d in cybersecurity. \u201cWe can wait for that to occur,\u201d he said, \u201cor we can start something like this and try to head that off. \u2026 That becomes a whole-of-nation effort.\u201d\n\nHAPPY WEDNESDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity! Wait, what? Send your thoughts, feedback and especially tips to tstarks@politico.com, and be sure to follow @POLITICOPro and @MorningCybersec. Full team info below.\n\nTHE FOUR HORSEMEN \u2014 In fall 2008, a U.S. service member stuck an infected USB flash drive into a laptop and set off a chain of events that would lead to the creation of U.S. Cyber Command. Now, as the president unshackles the organization, the architects of the newest U.S. military command offer rare insights into its origins and mission.\n\nA decade ago, the U.S. military was just beginning to confront the risk of digital espionage and cyber warfare. \u201cWhat [Defense Secretary Robert Gates] came up with and we discussed was, how do you better defend? Why do we have the offense and the defense in separate teams? Why don\u2019t you put those together?\u201d former NSA chief Keith Alexander told Martin. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to set up a new command, you need to do all the planning for that. How do you get the right folks to do that?\u201d\n\nThey became known as \u201cthe Four Horsemen,\u201d a brain trust tasked with hammering out the plan to build the country\u2019s first cyber warfare command and explaining it to a skeptical Washington. Today, Trump has formally elevated its status and made it the Defense Department\u2019s newest \u201cunified combatant command,\u201d only the 10th of its kind. The promotion was followed a series of policy moves by the White House that, taken together, show a willingness to act first and ask questions later in the digital domain. \u201cOur hands are not tied as they were in the Obama administration,\u201d national security adviser John Bolton said in September. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a lot of things offensively, and our adversaries need to know that,\u201d he added. Pros can read the full story here.\n\nTODAY: FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC \u2014 Two House panels combine their powers today for a hearing on cybersecurity cooperation between DHS and DoD. \u201cIt is imperative that the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense work hand in glove to protect our nation\u2019s systems, and to provide assistance to our critical infrastructure partners,\u201d Rep. John Ratcliffe, chairman of the House Homeland Security cybersecurity subcommittee, says in prepared opening remarks. Also imperative, according to Ratcliffe: that DHS take the lead. \u201cA civilian led system embodies what the foundation that this democracy was built on.\u201d Ratcliffe\u2019s panel is teaming with the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities for the hearing.\n\nAcross the Capitol, the Senate Armed Services cyber subcommittee scrutinizes DoD cybersecurity acquisition practices. \u201cWhile we have confidence that the Department will bolster its cybersecurity in due time, we believe that this improvement could come as a result of improved cooperation with private sector cybersecurity companies and reconfiguration of the Department\u2019s cybersecurity capabilities to match the state-of-the-art offerings in the private sector,\u201d Sen. Mike Rounds, chairman of the subcommittee, says in prepared remarks.\n\nMAYBE SOME PEOPLE ARE LEAVING? \u2014 A possible Trump administration shakeup post-midterms had apparently claimed its first victim Tuesday only for The Wall Street Journal to walk back the story \u2014 although there could still be a reckoning ahead. The Journal reported that Mira Ricardel, Bolton\u2019s top deputy, had been escorted out of the White House, but the administration denied that. Still, Melania Trump\u2019s rare public appeal doesn\u2019t bode well for Ricardel, who was an advocate of eliminating the White House cybersecurity coordinator position and absorbing its duties into her portfolio, as we reported back in May.\n\nDHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\u2019s head is also on the block, potentially, but there\u2019s no permanent deputy secretary in place. Claire Grady is acting deputy and would assume the job if Nielsen is pushed out. While Grady has served as the DHS face on some cybersecurity discussions since assuming the role, it\u2019s not a major part of her background. Former Immigration and Customs Enforcement chief Thomas Homan, whose background is in law enforcement, is in the mix for long-term replacements, any of whom might shift attention away from cyber. With wildfires raging in California, the timing might be problematic for the president, given DHS\u2019s emergency management role.\n\nCISA\u2019S ON ITS WAY \u2014 The House on Tuesday evening sent a bill (H.R. 3359) to Trump reorganizing DHS\u2019s main cyber division into the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Agency. Nielsen, Ratcliffe and others applauded the House for clearing the legislation. The measure, which Trump is expected to sign given that every leading DHS official and even Vice President Mike Pence lobbied for it, will \u201cbolster public-private partnerships to help ensure businesses have the resources and support necessary before, during, and after a cyber incident,\u201d said Christopher Roberti, the senior vice president for cyber, intelligence and security policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nOPM STILL WEAK ON CYBER \u2014 The Office of Personnel Management still has a ways to go to secure its data, according to a Government Accountability Office report released Tuesday. Nearly a third of the 80 recommendations by the GAO after the 2015 breach have not been implemented, leaving the agency that maintains personal data on millions of current and former federal workers \u201cat increased risk of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or disruption,\u201d the report concluded. However, OPM plans to implement most of the remaining recommendations by the end of fiscal year 2018.\n\nOPM\u2019s security problems are nothing new. A security audit in late October from OPM\u2019s Office of the Inspector General mirrors GAO\u2019s concerns. The audit found that IT operations are \u201cinappropriately decentralized\u201d and that while procedures and policies are documented, they are not consistently implemented.\n\nIN THEIR DEFENSE, IT\u2019S ONLY BEEN THREE YEARS \u2014 The Pentagon hasn\u2019t fully implemented all its requirements under the 2015 cybersecurity information sharing law, according to an inspector general report out Tuesday. The biggest barrier, the IG found, is that DoD\u2019s chief information officer didn\u2019t issue a policy on implementing the law. \u201cAs a result, the DoD limited its ability to gain a more complete understanding of cybersecurity threats since it did not fully leverage the collective knowledge and capabilities of sharing entities, or disseminate internally generated cyber threat indicators and defensive measures with other Federal and non\u2011Federal entities,\u201d the report found. There were also problems with sub-agencies implementing the law and verifying security clearances.\n\nRECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY \u2014 Chinese hackers are borrowing techniques from one of Russia\u2019s most infamous hacking groups, according to Recorded Future. \u2026 A senior DoD official said Russian and Chinese cyberattacks on defense suppliers is one of the Pentagon\u2019s biggest problems. \u2026 China contends that a U.S. ban on chipmaker Jinhau violates World Trade Organization rules. \u2026 Incoming House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff called on acting Attorney General Mark Whitaker to recuse himself from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe, and warned that Democrats would be watching him.\n\nTWEET OF THE DAY \u2014 *somber music plays*\n\nREPORT WATCH\n\n\u2014 Sophisticated bad bots used in cyberattacks make up 44 percent of all traffic on airline websites, mobile apps and application programming interfaces, according to research out today from Distil Networks.

They may be indicative of a larger national trend, according to preliminary data released this week.\n\nDrop off: Immigrant households legally eligible for food-stamp benefits stopped participating in the program at a higher-than-normal rate in the first half of this year, the data show.\n\nFirst dive: The data is the first broad look at Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participation declines among immigrants, surveying more than 35,000 mothers across five U.S. cities. It found that participation dropped by nearly 10 percentage points in the first half of 2018 for immigrant households that are eligible for the program and have been in the U.S. less than five years \u2014 compared with a participation rate of 43 percent from 2007 to 2017.\n\n\u2014 The study seems to confirm months of anecdotal reports, from New York to San Antonio, Texas, that widespread fear in immigrant communities has had a chilling effect on participation in SNAP and other government aid programs like WIC, a federal nutrition program aimed at pregnant women and children.\n\n\u2014 \u201cWe were hearing the anecdotal reports of people dropping out of SNAP and WIC, so we started looking at our data to see if that was true among the families we interview,\u201d said Allison Bovell-Ammon, lead researcher and deputy director for policy strategy at Boston Medical Center\u2019s Children\u2019s HealthWatch, which conducted the study.

The oyster population has declined by about 85 percent in the Gulf region, which leads the nation in commercial production.\n\nThe situation has become so grave that Alabama for the first time called off its oyster harvesting season due to scarcity. Officials are under pressure to balance protecting oysters as a commodity and as part of a habitat \u2014 the shellfish are integral to the survival of other marine wildlife.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only getting worse,\u201d said Seth Blitch, the Nature Conservancy\u2019s director of coastal and marine conservation in Louisiana. \u201cThese states are faced with trying to maintain stocks so there is a commercial harvest while trying to maintain natural resources, too.\u201d\n\nWhere have all the oysters gone? The shortages, researchers say, aren\u2019t so much about water quality as they are about water quantity. Imbalances of freshwater caused by droughts, hurricanes and other factors have decimated ecosystems and harvests.\n\nThe fight over freshwater access for oysters has even made its way to the Supreme Court \u2014 Florida and Georgia have been locked in a decadeslong battle over water access. In June, a divided court gave the Sunshine State another chance to prove Georgia was harming its oyster habitat by consuming too much water from the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River basin.\n\n\u2014 The case, which has been sent back to a court-appointed special master for a final decision, could foreshadow how courts will play a role juggling water usage between humans and wildlife.\n\nHow to rebuild: States are tapping into their funds from the 2010 BP oil spill settlement reserved solely for oyster restoration. Texas, for example, announced today that it\u2019s using $5 million of those funds to build an artificial reef that can be used for both restoration and harvesting.\n\nTRADE MEETINGS ON DECK: U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m will meet today in D.C. to continue laying the groundwork ahead of formal bilateral negotiations starting as soon as mid-January.\n\nEuropean nations are considering ramping up their purchases of U.S. biofuel ingredients like rapeseed, our POLITICO Pro Europe colleagues reported this week \u2014 a potential olive branch for American farmers that might help the EU keep broader agricultural issues out of the upcoming trade talks.\n\nBut President Donald Trump wasn\u2019t exactly feeling the love Tuesday morning, when he targeted France with a tweetstorm including a gripe about French wine tariffs. He\u2019s set to meet with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the G-20 gathering this month in Buenos Aires.\n\nMain event: He\u2019ll also join Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 for a highly anticipated face-to-face discussion on trade (and other issues). Our colleagues on the POLITICO White House team tell MA that U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad met with Trump in D.C. last Thursday to go over plans for the meeting with Xi. (Lighthizer, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House chief of staff John Kelly were also there.)\n\nListen up: Pro Trade\u2019s Doug Palmer joins the POLITICO Money podcast to explain how the trade feud with China could go from bad to worse, and fast.

Denham\u2019s loss comes despite a late campaign boost from Trump, who delivered Republicans in the farmland region a major win on all-important water policy. Here\u2019s more on the final result.\n\n\u2014 Anti-pesticide groups oppose Hutchins\u2019 nomination: More than 245 groups against the broad use of pesticides are opposing Scott Hutchins\u2019 nomination as USDA chief scientist because they say his ties to Corteva Agriscience, a division of DowDuPont, \u201cpresent serious conflicts of interest that will undoubtedly affect his ability\u201d to serve in the role if confirmed by the Senate. You can find the letter here.\n\n\u2014 Atrazine levels widespread in corn belt water sources: The Environmental Working Group today released a new analysis of drinking water contaminated by the weedkiller atrazine in corn-growing regions. EWG found that potentially harmful levels of the herbicide have been detected in drinking water for nearly 30 million Americans across 28 states. The group previously released a tap water quality database as part of its efforts to raise attention about agriculture\u2019s impact on water quality in rural areas.\n\n\u2014 Immigrant ag workers still reeling from Hurricane Florence: Undocumented laborers in North Carolina, fearing possible deportation, have avoided seeking disaster assistance after the storm caused severe flooding in the state\u2019s major pork producing regions.

The details of the U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol are still being finalized, but a pilot project will launch in 2019 and full implementation is expected for the 2020 crop year. Read more here.\n\n\u2014 Green group partners with corn growers: The National Corn Growers Association and Environmental Defense Fund in a new partnership being announced today plan to focus on metrics to track progress on practices designed to improve water quality, soil health and reduce greenhouse gas emissions on American farms, while promoting profitability. Beyond data collection, the two groups also will work together on advocating for voluntary conservation programs with measurable outcomes.\n\n\u2014 An orange forecast: Over the next three years, Florida orange production is expected to drop as old groves are replaced and new ones start to bear fruit \u2014 continuing a steady decline over the last two decades largely due to citrus greening disease, according to a new report by CoBank, a top lender to rural agribusinesses, cooperatives and utilities. Imports of orange juice from Brazil are on track to increase to meet U.S. demand.\n\n\u2014 How dicamba drift came to be: Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting and the Food & Environment Reporting Network did a deep dive on the history of dicamba and EPA\u2019s recent decision to reauthorize the controversial pesticide for two years, despite some scientists warning of continued unintended damage to crops.\n\nTHAT\u2019S ALL FOR MA!

It\u2019s nominally a nonpartisan race, but it\u2019s no secret which candidate California Democrats prefer: The California Teachers Association, that steadfast liberal ally, and the California Democratic Party have invested millions in pushing state Assemblyman Tony Thurmond over the top, while Sen. Kamala Harris and now-Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom boosted Thurmond in campaign ads and appearances. They\u2019re all seeking to counteract the millions that have flowed from charter school allies to back Marshall Tuck.\n\n-- A protracted deficit for Thurmond in the days after the election suggested a rare defeat for the CTA might be coming. But after Thurmond went from trailing to a vanishingly tiny statistical margin \u2014 he and Tuck were at one point locked in a dead heat Tuesday \u2014 his lead jumped to well over 60,000 votes on the strength of a late update. With a mountain of ballots left to count \u2014 keep in mind Tuck was up by tens of thousands just days ago \u2014 this one bears watching.\n\n-- ONE MORE HOTSPOT: Also worth keeping an eye on: the 16th state Assembly District, where longstanding efforts to topple the Bay Area\u2019s sole Republican lawmaker could come to fruition.

Jim Jordan the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee. | Alex Wong/Getty Images Congress Jordan touts Freedom Caucus bona fides in GOP leadership bid\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, the former chairman of the House Freedom Caucus who is running to be the next House Republican leader, said Wednesday that the GOP lost its majority in the House because it failed to match the \"intensity\" of President Donald Trump.\n\nJordan (R-Ohio), widely considered to be the underdog candidate against Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in Wednesday's leadership elections, held up his bona fides as a leader of the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus as one of his top qualifications for the job of GOP leader.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cTwo years ago the American people elected President Trump to come to this town to shake it up and he's done just that.

Bruce Rauner vetoed before the midterms. Tuesday was a lot of procedural work with little action. But there was some political theater. It centered on a vetoed bill that calls for more regulation of \u201cpeer to peer\u201d rental car companies. Those are businesses that allow individuals to rent out their own cars much the way home owners rent out their homes. A group of D\u2019s and R\u2019s gathered with Hertz and other rental-car company officials at a press conference calling for an override. They say it\u2019s necessary because car owners don\u2019t always adhere to safety regulations. The bill would require that and would make sure car owners pay their fair share of taxes at airports, just the way rental car companies do.\n\nAfter the press conference, a man stood up saying he represents Turo, one of the companies that a company that manages those car rentals. It was a dramatic move that got him kicked out of the room since he didn\u2019t reserve it. More interesting, he announced his name: Lou Bertuca. Yeah that Lou Bertuca, the former aide to Gov. Pat Quinn. Bertuca now lives in California and oversees government relations for Turo. In the hallway, he told reporters the bill would unfairly tax individuals trying to make a living.\n\nWe\u2019ll see what lawmakers think.

Cohn, known for years as a Wall Street tough guy, regularly displayed his disdain for protectionist trade adviser Peter Navarro, moving to reduce Navarro\u2019s role and keeping him out of meetings. Kudlow, genteel and gregarious by nature, has tried to stay on good terms with Navarro and keep policy disputes civil and inside the building.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat changed on Tuesday with Kudlow publicly rebuking Navarro during a CNBC interview over Navarro\u2019s deeply hawkish China speech on Friday. The vibe coming out of the White House \u2014 partly in response to market declines \u2014 has been that progress is being made with China and that the G-20 meeting could pave the way for a deal. Navarro stomped all over that. And Kudlow was unhappy.\n\nAnd he spoke in ways that had to have approval from the president. Kudlow and Trump kibitz regularly in person and by phone and it\u2019s very difficult to imagine that the NEC director spoke this way about Navarro without approval from the president. This matters because among the most consequential economic decisions facing the White House right now is whether to enter into a full-blown trade war with China.\n\nHere\u2019s what Kudlow said: \u201cLook, Peter Navarro is a friend of mine, truly. We\u2019ve known each other for 20 years, but he was not speaking for the president, nor was he speaking for the administration. His remarks were way off base. They were not authorized by anybody. I actually think he did the president a great disservice. Look, the president can talk to whomever he can talk to. He talks to people on Wall Street, yes. He talks to union leaders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in some of those meetings. He talks to other outside advisers. He has every right to do so. And the president has said \u2026 that if there is a deal to be had with China, it\u2019s a deal that has to be in American interests. So I think Peter very badly misspoke. He was freelancing and he\u2019s not representing the president or the administration.\u201d\n\nWIN FOR THE FREE TRADERS (FOR NOW) \u2014 The White House meeting on Tuesday on auto tariffs concluded with an agreement not to move forward with the levies for now, according to a person familiar with the meeting. The Commerce Department will continue to work on a report about whether imported autos impact national security. Trump has been hot to slap the tariffs on for quite a while but the auto industry doesn\u2019t want them. And markets don\u2019t want them. And they would presumably complicate negotiations with the EU barring a blanket exemption. For now they will remain a threat in Trump\u2019s back pocket.\n\nCRUNCH TIME ON TRADE \u2014 In the latest POLITICO Money podcast, POLITICO senior trade reporter Doug Palmer explains the potential for Trump to hit over $500 billion in Chinese imports with tariffs as high as 25 percent over the coming months. Consumers would feel such tariffs immediately and quite painfully.\n\nTrump is scheduled to sit down with Chinese premier Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 Summit at the end of the month in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Free traders inside the administration are hoping the bilateral talks forestall another round of tariffs and set up future negotiations.\n\nBut there is a raging battle going on inside the West Wing with Navarro trying to tamp down hopes for the talks and free-trade voices including Kudlow sounding hopeful. The fear among the free traders is that another big round of tariffs will drive up consumer prices, further impede American exporters \u2013 especially farmers \u2013 and slow down economic growth. Higher prices caused by tariffs could also push the Federal Reserve into more aggressive interest rate hikes to fight inflation.\n\nFIRST LOOK: FREEDOM PARTNERS PRESS TRUMP/XI \u2014 In a letter going out this a.m., Americans for Prosperity, Freedom Partners, and The LIBRE Initiative press Trump and Xi to make progress at the G-20: \u201cThere is great urgency for the United States and China to come together and reach an agreement to eliminate tariffs and protectionist trade policies. The continued escalation of tariffs has come at significant cost to the global economy.\n\n\u201cIt has harmed businesses, farmers, consumers, workers, and families worldwide, inflicting higher costs, lost jobs, and uncertainty.

The fresh round of backbiting and post-midterm turnover could also sweep out Trump\u2019s chief of staff John Kelly, a close Nielsen ally, and see him replaced with Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Nick Ayers\u201d Read more.\n\nTRUMP RAGES AT THERESA MAY \u2014 WP\u2019s Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker: \u201cAs he jetted to Paris last Friday \u2026 Trump received a congratulatory phone call aboard Air Force One. British Prime Minister Theresa May was calling to celebrate the Republican Party\u2019s wins in the midterm elections \u2014 never mind that Democrats seized control of the House \u2014 but her appeal to the American president\u2019s vanity was met with an ornery outburst.\n\n\u201cTrump berated May for Britain not doing enough, in his assessment, to contain Iran. He questioned her over Brexit and complained about the trade deals he sees as unfair with European countries. May has endured Trump\u2019s churlish temper before, but still her aides were shaken by his especially foul mood, according to U.S. and European officials briefed on the conversation.\u201d Read more.\n\nTHE LIST OF THINGS ANGERING TRUMP \u2014 An incomplete tally: Markets are a mess; Growth appears to be slowing; Democrats now control the House and can investigate him; More House races continue to get called for Democrats and the GOP Senate performance looks less and less impressive; Rumors continue to swirl of potential Mueller indictments; Trump's Paris trip was widely panned as a disaster; His replacement Attorney General is mired in controversy; CNN is suing over the ouster of its reporter and looks likely to win.

That moving average is no longer pointed upward and is descending, in another negative sign for analysts who follow the charts.

The shares\u2019 three-day plunge was the worst since August 2011.\n\n\u201cThe financial impact and reputational damage of the scandal are \u2018nearly impossible to quantify at this point in time,\u2019 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl wrote in a note Tuesday. \u2018The ultimate question is who knew what and when regarding 1MDB and that question remains open-ended for now.\u2019\u201d Read more.\n\nFLY AROUND\n\nAMAZON PICKS NEW YORK CITY, NORTHERN VIRGINIA FOR NEW HQ \u2014 Reuters\u2019 Jeffrey Dastin and David Shepardson: \u201cAmazon.com Inc picked America\u2019s financial and political capitals for massive new offices on Tuesday, branching out from its home base in Seattle with plans to create more than 25,000 jobs in both New York City and an area just outside Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s largest online retailer plans to spend $5 billion on the two new developments in Long Island City and Arlington, Virginia, and expects to get more than $2 billion in tax credits and incentives with plans to apply for more.\u201d Read more.\n\nMOST BANKS LEFT BUSINESS LENDING STANDARDS UNTOUCHED IN Q3 \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Paul Kiernan: \u201cMost banks in the U.S. left their standards for lending to businesses little changed in the third quarter, according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest survey of senior loan officers. Of those that changed their business-lending standards, more eased than tightened, the Fed said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMore banks eased standards on commercial and industrial loans than tightened them in the third quarter, particularly in the case of large firms with more than $50 million in annual revenue, according to the survey, which was conducted in early October.

The Treasury Department said Tuesday that the deficit shot up 59 percent from the same month a year ago. Last year\u2019s October deficit was smaller because the government paid $48 billion in benefits in September because Oct. 1 fell on the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe government has run a deficit in every October going back to the early 1950s. The new report begins a budget year in which the federal deficit is expected to soar above $1 trillion, reflecting in part the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts Congress approved last December.\u201d Read more.", "PELOSI LAUNCHES CHARM OFFENSIVE -- Trump meddles in minority leader race -- DENHAM LOSES -- Merkley seeks Booker law in Oregon\n\nBy Nolan D.

Pelosi made a surprise appearance at the Congressional Progressive Caucus\u2019 freshman orientation Monday and held a reception Tuesday afternoon at an Italian restaurant by the D.C. waterfront. \u201cOn Wednesday, the members-elect will be introduced to their colleagues at a Democratic Caucus meeting, a lengthy process that will put them onstage with Pelosi,\u201d Bres, Rachael and Kyle report.\n\n\u201cThe California Democrat will follow that up with an appearance at the Congressional Black Caucus, a powerful faction inside the Democratic Caucus,\u201d they continue. \u201cThen, Pelosi will host a private dinner for members-elect and their spouses Wednesday evening in Statuary Hall, right off the House floor.\u201d Democratic Party luminaries, including former Vice President Al Gore, former Secretary of State John Kerry and Govs. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, are making calls on Pelosi\u2019s behalf. Pelosi herself has also made calls -- and held private meetings -- to members-elect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all part of the \u2018Pelosi for Speaker\u2019 blitz, with the California Democrat showing off every trick in her vast arsenal of persuasive tactics as she works to round up the votes she needs to win two upcoming votes: one inside the Democratic Caucus on Nov. 28, and the critical one on the House floor Jan. 3,\u201d they write. \u201cWhile Pelosi will easily get a majority inside the Democratic Caucus, how she handles that vote is crucial. Letting some members and members-elect vote against her so they can say they opposed her, for example, would then free them up to back her on the floor. That will set the stage for the run-up to the Jan. 3 vote, where the stakes will be far higher.\u201d More: https://politi.co/2RUgPvH\n\nRelated: \u201cNine Democrats want promises from Pelosi in exchange for speaker votes,\u201d by The Washington Post\u2019s Mike DeBonis: https://wapo.st/2TalScG ; and \u201cAnti-Pelosi Democrats Claim They Have Numbers to Block Her in Speaker Floor Vote,\u201d from Roll Call\u2019s Lindsey McPherson: http://bit.ly/2qL6Z3J\n\nHOYER HAS THE VOTES -- House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) has already clinched enough votes to become majority leader in the next Congress. \u201cDespite calls for new leadership, Hoyer has faced the least resistance among House Democrats\u2019 big three,\u201d Bres and I note. \u201cHe has the support of at least two-thirds of the incoming Democratic Caucus, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO.\u201d More than 150 Democrats announced their support for Hoyer in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter Tuesday afternoon, casting him as the best person for the job.

Trump believes Jordan would be a ferocious defender, and the Ohio Republican wants the post. \u201cBut McCarthy does not have authority to unilaterally appoint a lawmaker to any ranking member position,\u201d they note. \u201cRather, the decision is up to the Republican Steering Committee, a collection of members who do not like Jordan and may not take their cues from the White House.\u201d More: https://politi.co/2PuBHwQ\n\nRelated read: \u201cStung by election losses, House GOP weighs leadership choice,\u201d from The Associated Press\u2019 Lisa Mscaro: http://bit.ly/2PXwb5j\n\nSHUTDOWN WATCH -- The upcoming government funding fight will center on the president\u2019s border wall and special counsel Robert Mueller. \u201cDemocrats said Tuesday they might insist that language protecting Mueller\u2019s job security be included in a must-pass spending bill due by Dec. 7,\u201d Burgess reports. \u201cWith Mueller\u2019s probe on Russian interference in the 2016 election winding down and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) loath to bring up a standalone Mueller-protection bill, Democrats argue it could be their last chance to shield the special counsel from Trump.

In addition, the polling showed 87 percent of voters agreeing on the ability of incarcerated individuals to get credits for good behavior as well as engaging in training and treatment programs.\n\nCOMMITTEE SHUFFLE -- Grassley is mulling whether to stay atop the Judiciary Committee or chair the Finance Committee.

Such primaries, they claim, benefit political parties while disenfranchising independent voters.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe lawsuit hinges on a specific \u201canti-donation\u201d clause of the New Mexico constitution. But supporters say the case, if successful, could have ramifications beyond New Mexico, serving as leverage to pressure lawmakers in other closed primary states.\n\n\u201cPoliticians, not surprisingly, are reluctant to change a system that they\u2019re comfortable with,\u201d said John Opdycke, president of Open Primaries. \u201cBy raising the basic premise that publicly funded elections should be open to everybody, I think can really help both in the courts, but also in legislatures, to create more momentum.\u201d\n\nThe issue rose to national prominence in 2016, when Bernie Sanders railed against closed primaries as an anti-democratic practice during his unsuccessful run for the Democratic presidential nomination. As he campaigned in the New York \u2014 a state with a closed primary \u2014Sanders argued that the practice was \u201cwrong.\u201d\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Though the court that year considered a challenge based on a different part of the state constitution, it nevertheless cast doubt on the argument that independent voters are disenfranchised.\n\nRegistering with a party, the court ruled at the time, \u201cis a reasonably modest burden that furthers the State\u2019s interest in securing the purity of elections and efficiently administering them.\u201d\n\nIn its current lawsuit, Open Primaries argues closed primaries constitute an unconstitutional donation to a private entity.\n\n\u201cNew Mexico\u2019s closed primary elections are exclusionary and held for the benefit of major political parties, which are purely private entities,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cEven though the primary election is closed and exclusionary, primary elections are paid for by public funds and New Mexico taxpayers, while the major political parties reap the benefits.\u201d\n\nNew Mexico is one of nine closed-primary states, while another seven states allow parties to determine whether unaffiliated voters may participate in their nominating contests, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nTwenty-eight states currently hold fully open primary elections or primaries in which unaffiliated voters may participate in any primary they choose, according to the NCSL.\n\n\u201cWhat we hope to bring with this case is renewed attention on how our primary election system in this country, which is often times run for the benefit of private organizations, has been publicly subsidized for years at the expense of the public,\u201d said Jeremy Gruber, senior vice president at Open Primaries. \u201cIf the parties are allowed to be gatekeepers and decide who can and can\u2019t participate, then these are not public elections for the purpose of public funding, and they should no longer be subsidized.\u201d", "PRESSLEY\u2019S Instagram \u2014 MORSE makes 30 UNDER 30 list \u2014 What about 2022?\n\nGOOD MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS.\n\nCongress through PRESSLEY'S INSTAGRAM \u2014 If you want an inside look at freshman orientation underway for new lawmakers in Washington this week, just open Instagram.

On her Instagram story, where temporary photos and videos last for 24 hours, there was a shot of her leaning in for a selfie with newly elected Congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan with the hashtag #NMO2018.\n\nIn another photo captioned \"just a few freshman orientation essentials\" she's got a to-go cup from Hill favorite Compass Coffee, a \"bring your own chair\" pin, an \"indivisible\" pen and a notebook arranged neatly on the table with a \"Washington, D.C.\" location tag.\n\nClick over to Ocasio-Cortez's profile and you'll find a photo of the four newly-elected congresswomen with the caption \"Squad\" and a video of them walking down the hallway together. The Cut summed up their Instagram posts in this headline : \"Your Cool New Congresswomen Are Already Hanging Out.\" I'm interested to see how these new lawmakers use social media to communicate with constituents and reporters throughout the next Congress.\n\nMORSE makes 30 UNDER 30 \u2014 Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse landed on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list yesterday. First elected as Holyoke's youngest and first openly gay mayor in 2011 at age 22, today he ranks among the city's longest-serving mayors. And now, at age 29, he's the city's first mayor to make it into the roundup of influential millennials, too.\n\n\"There were a lot of assumptions that I'd be mayor for a short period of time and then quickly move on, and I think now being in my fourth term I've demonstrated a long term commitment to the city,\" Morse told me. \"I think it takes a while to make progress on really big issues in an urban community like Holyoke, and that's why I ran in the first place.\"\n\nMorse said being named to the 30 Under 30 list is a \"consequence of doing good work\" in the city, and points to downtown revitalization, housing, transit-oriented development, a drop in crime and a rise in high school graduation rates as some of his achievements after seven years as mayor. Up next, he says, is Holyoke's position in the marijuana industry.\n\nAnd as for running for higher office in the future, perhaps governor in four years, Morse says \"it's way too early to think about it.\" The Holyoke mayor was named as a potential 2022 candidate in a Boston Globe story Tuesday afternoon about some very, very early speculation. \"I don't know what the future holds. I see a future in public service, potentially in a different capacity one day, but for now I love what I do here in Holyoke,\" Morse said.\n\nHave a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

In Massachusetts, where politics is both blood sport and parlor game, it\u2019s never too early to think about who might run for governor in four years. Okay, okay, it\u2019s too early!

The answer, as so often happens in matters of transport, is that it\u2019s complicated. There\u2019s little doubt the prospect of Amazon HQ2, as it\u2019s called, helped revive the idea of extending the Blue Line to meet the Red at Charles/MGH Station.

But even if some some groups are left out, it doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t eventually see a boost in their pay, he said.

It was the first time that New Jersey has brought legal action against a company based in the state as it struggles to contain a spiraling opioid addiction crisis. And it comes at a time when state attorneys general across the country have intensified their efforts to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for the epidemics of abuse. Gurbir Grewal, the New Jersey attorney general, said the subsidiary, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, minimized the risks of opioid addiction in its marketing messages, targeted older people and other patients with little knowledge of opioids and mounted a campaign to \u2018embed its deceptions about the viability of long-term opioid use in the minds of doctors and patients.\u2019\u201d Read more here\n\nCOOPER TRAUMA SURGEONS FINALLY GET THAT RAISE \u2014 Cooper Health raising its minimum wage to $15 for all workers, by POLITICO\u2019s Sam Sutton: Cooper University Health Care in Camden will raise the minimum wage it pays its workers to at least $15 an hour, a move that should result in wage gains for 10 percent of the system\u2019s workforce, or roughly 750 employees, Chairman George Norcross announced today.

Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, negotiated it, and the way they rolled it out to the world yesterday \u2014 emblematized a key feature of de Blasio\u2019s mayoralty: the often yawning chasm between his rhetoric and his actions.\n\nThe deal came together despite concerns from de Blasio\u2019s progressive allies, and despite his previous concern that behemoths like Amazon could destroy local stores. \u201cIf you\u2019re like me and you love your local neighborhood stores \u2014 your bakeries, your caf\u00e9, your clothing stores, all these things \u2014 then you need to spend your money there and not at Starbucks and not at other alternative places,\" de Blasio said last year.\n\nYesterday, he had something different to say.\n\n\u201cAmazon was going to have a second headquarters, and better it is us,\u201d de Blasio said. \"Better that a lot of that money ... will help us support small business and support neighborhoods. I feel really, really good about that.\"\n\nAnd the unabashedly pro-union mayor expects the best from the city's new tenants: \u201cAs to Amazon\u2019s much-criticized treatment of its lower-wage workers, de Blasio was optimistic that after imbibing New York City\u2019s special brew of union-friendliness, Amazon would change its ways,\u201d Dana and Gloria wrote yesterday.\n\n\u201cI would start by saying that I am happy Amazon will benefit from being in an environment that is pro-union and will start to see why this union town works so well,\u201d de Blasio said.\n\nDe Blasio and Cuomo agreed to make a secret end run around the City Council\u2019s sometimes cumbersome city planning process, to allay Amazon\u2019s concerns that local officials or City Council members could veto the project.\n\n\u201cYou have a democratically elected mayor and a democratically elected governor saying we had an unprecedented opportunity to add to the number of jobs in this city,\u201d de Blasio said, explaining his decision to simply bypass the city\u2019s typical process for building major projects. \u201cAnd we were not going to let that slip through our hands.\u201d\n\nAlmost three years ago, de Blasio signed a new law to cut noisy helicopter tourism traffic in the city in half, calling it \"a major quality of life issue.\" But the deal to land the Amazon headquarters includes a concession to help the company, headed by the country's richest man, build its own helipad. The deal would allow 120 helicopter landings a year, roughly one every three days.\n\nBefore the selection was announced, local elected officials wondered what Amazon would do for the surrounding community, home to the Queensbridge Houses \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest housing project and part of NYCHA, the crumbling home to more than 400,000 city residents. In the end, the stated terms of the deal include requirements that the trillion-dollar company provide some job training for Queensbridge residents, but do nothing to guarantee that those residents, many of whom are living at or below the poverty line, would fill any of the good-paying jobs the new headquarters will provide.\n\nDe Blasio, who once campaigned on the idea of ending \u201cthe tale of two cities,\u201d just marveled at the contrast:\n\n\"One of the biggest companies on earth next to the biggest public housing development in the United States \u2014 the synergy is going to be extraordinary,\" he said.\n\nIT\u2019S WEDNESDAY.

Amazon\u2019s interest was made known scarcely a week ago, yet brokers say they are already selling units\u2014sometimes sight-unseen\u2014via text message. Others are renting vans and packing them full of clients eager to view multiple buildings, or holding group tours in Chinese. Now, with Amazon\u2019s commitment to the New York City neighborhood, brokers are predicting the apartment market there will surge further..Up until last week, the Long Island City market had suffered from slowing sales and rising inventory. Now, some brokers say the sudden mood shift reminds them of the heady days of New York City\u2019s condo boom just before the housing market crashed during the 2008 financial crisis. \u2018This is the first time in my 20-year career that I have seen the market go from a buyer\u2019s market to a seller\u2019s market overnight, based on a rumor,\u2019 Mr. Smith said..\u201d Wall Street Journal\u2019s Josh Barbanel\n\n\u2014 The New York Times\u2019 Karen Weise and J.

The more than $1.5 billion in direct tax breaks and grants the state is offering Amazon to create jobs here \u2014 $48,000 a job \u2014 would be fine if this were 1978, not 2018. Back then, Gotham\u2019s biggest problem was the loss of hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, as companies and people fled a failing city.

TOM EMMER of Minnesota will be the next NRCC chairman.\n\n\u2026 BUT, BUT, BUT \u2026 KYLE CHENEY, JOHN BRESNAHAN and RACHAEL BADE: \u201cTrump quietly meddles in McCarthy-Jordan leadership brawl\u201d: \u201cOn the eve of Kevin McCarthy\u2019s long-awaited defeat of his nemesis, Rep. Jim Jordan, President Donald Trump is jumping into the fray to play peacemaker.\n\n\u201cTrump has privately urged the House majority leader to strike a deal with the conservative Freedom Caucus founder, who is challenging McCarthy for the minority leader post next Congress, multiple lawmakers and aides said. It remains unclear what exactly the deal would entail.\n\n\u201cThe discussions between the president and McCarthy about Jordan, which took place last week, set off a round of speculation among lawmakers inside the Capitol that Trump may try to push Jordan to become the top Republican lawmaker on the House Judiciary Committee, a panel expected to launch an array of Democratic investigations against the president \u2014 and possibly even an impeachment probe.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- THE FREEDOM CAUCUS is all but dead at this point, and McCarthy is going to easily put away Jordan in this leadership race. But they are now viewing how McCarthy treats Jordan as a litmus test. The president has put McCarthy in quite a position by asking him to cut a deal with Jordan, and place him at the top of Judiciary. Insiders thought Jordan would\u2019ve been great at Oversight and Government Reform, where Jordan was next in line. Jordan has to jump Reps. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) and Steve King (R-Iowa) to get to the top of Judiciary -- not a huge lift.\n\nBUT KEEP IN MIND that McCarthy doing anything to help the Freedom Caucus at this point is an internal struggle for the California Republican. There\u2019s a domino effect by putting Jordan at Judiciary: it seems very likely that MARK MEADOWS (R-N.C.) will make a run for his party\u2019s top slot at Oversight and Government Reform.\n\nTHIS WOULD PUT Jordan and Meadows -- two Freedom Caucus guys who have tormented the Republican leadership -- at the top of the two most critical investigative committees.\n\nCALIFORNIA REP. JEFF DENHAM, a close McCarthy ally, lost his Central Valley seat to Democrat Josh Harder yesterday. The California GOP delegation has been absolutely decimated.\n\nHappy Wednesday. SPOTTED: SEN.

Ms. Ricardel had announced the trip before it was fully planned, according to one of the people, and then threatened to pull resources for it after learning that she did not have a seat on Mrs. Trump\u2019s plane.\n\n\u201cAfter the trip ended, Ms. Ricardel made accusations of inappropriate behavior by Mrs. Trump\u2019s most trusted staff members, including Lindsay Reynolds, the first lady\u2019s chief of staff \u2014 claims that a person close to the first lady said were false.\n\n\u201cMrs. Trump then complained to John F.

The state of Maryland on Tuesday filed the first legal challenge seeking to overturn Whitaker\u2019s appointment, while on Capitol Hill newly empowered House Democrats are already making plans to have the acting attorney general appear as one of their first witnesses when the next Congress launches in January.\n\n\u201cThe uproar over the appointment, which effectively removes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as Mueller\u2019s primary supervisor, has put Whitaker in a difficult spot, trapped between setting off a political firestorm by clipping Mueller\u2019s wings and angering a president intent on having him do just that.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cWhitaker abandoned taxpayer-funded project in Iowa in 2016,\u201d by AP\u2019s Ryan Foley and David Pitt in Des Moines: \u201cWhile in private business, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker walked away from a taxpayer-subsidized apartment-rehabilitation project in Iowa after years of cost overruns, delays and other problems, public records show.\n\n\u201cThe city of Des Moines ultimately yanked an affordable housing loan that Whitaker\u2019s company had been awarded, and another lender began foreclosure proceedings after Whitaker defaulted on a separate loan for nearly $700,000.

Scott Applewhite/AP photo elections New effort promises 1,000 trained Democratic staffers for 2020\n\nAnticipating a sprawling Democratic presidential field and a shortage of experienced, high-quality campaign professionals, a left-leaning group is launching a $4.5 million effort to train 1,000 staffers to be ready in time for 2020 combat.\n\nThe group, called Arena, will begin holding training academies across the country in 2019, with a goal of deploying at least 450 of those trainees onto Democratic presidential primary campaigns or in state legislative races.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe know there\u2019s going to be unprecedented demand, it\u2019s going to be the most crowded presidential primary we\u2019ve had in a long time,\u201d said Kate Catherall, Arena co-founder and senior partner.\n\nThe initiative comes as a massive potential field begins to take shape on the Democratic side. Before the midterm primaries had even concluded, potential presidential contenders were already working to lock down staff. Top-tier prospective candidates like Sens. Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren were interviewing candidates, hiring personnel or calling possible hires in early presidential states. Maryland Congressman John Delaney has already announced his candidacy, as has West Virginia Democrat Richard Ojeda.\n\nProfessional operatives are already expressing concern that there won\u2019t be enough high-caliber staff to fill positions, said Ravi Gupta, Arena managing partner.\n\n\u201cThere just aren\u2019t enough folks within Democratic politics with a lot of experience for those roles,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cPart of our job is going to be a sorting mechanism, through a short, intense experience \u2026 help identify people as quickly as possible who grow really quickly, have a lot of talent and a lot of energy and humility to do the kinds of jobs there are going to be needed.\u201d\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

He must be able to do two things at once: Stay on top of the key issues that have made him a leader of the \u201cState of Resistance\u201d against President Donald Trump while simultaneously establishing himself as a power broker in Sacramento who can manage a booming economy and $16 billion in surplus and \u201crainy day\u201d reserves as hungry Democrats push for new spending and initiatives.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs leader of the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy\u2014the state that\u2019s home to Silicon Valley, Hollywood and the nation\u2019s agricultural breadbasket, the vast Central Valley\u2014Newsom will automatically be catapulted into the ranks of future Democratic prospects for the White House. The political pressures of a party eager to unseat Trump may pit him, eventually, against fellow Californians like Sen. Kamala Harris and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. And already, the increased scrutiny has put him in the sights of conservative Fox News commentators and Trump himself, who referred to him as a \u201cclown\u201d in stump speeches during the midterms. Although Newsom insists he is keeping his focus entirely on California for the next eight years, his path could be mined with political risks, should the state\u2019s currently booming economy run out of gas\u2014and the costly effects of wildfires and climate change could tarnish even a popular young governor\u2019s future prospects.\n\nNewsom\u2019s political godfather Willie Brown, the former San Francisco mayor and assembly speaker\u2014who launched Newsom\u2019s political career when he appointed his enthusiastic 20-something campaign aide to a spot on the city\u2019s traffic commission more than two decades ago\u2014warns that weathering all this will require some political magic tricks.\n\nOne trick is getting out from under the shadow of Jerry Brown, the four-term governor and son of the late Gov. Edmund \u201cPat\u201d Brown, who has known him since childhood.\n\nAnother is marshaling the sharp elbows Newsom honed in the mosh pit of local San Francisco politics, while forging his own governing style in Sacramento\u2014a town Newsom has never called home.\n\nWillie Brown advises Newsom to make an immediate departure from the press-adverse Jerry Brown and schedule weekly press conferences in Sacramento, both to improve his relations with the media and to dominate the headlines. That approach will be necessary \u201cto gain the same presence that Jerry had by birth,\u2019\u2019 Willie Brown said. \u201cNewsom will have to work for it.\u201d\n\nBrown noted that unlike his predecessor, Newsom isn\u2019t a creature at home in Sacramento\u2019s insular political cultural or statewide Democratic Party machine politics. A business owner and entrepreneur who has enjoyed the backing of the Getty oil family, Newsom has frequently been labeled a \u201cpro-business Democrat.\u201d Early in his political career, he even described himself as a \u201cdogmatic fiscal conservative and a social liberal\u2019\u2019\u2014a profile that has earned him barbs from the party\u2019s far left.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not part of the Democratic Party on a full-time basis. He\u2019s not part of organized labor on a full-time basis. He\u2019s not part of the business world on a full-time basis,\u201d Brown said. While \u201cthere will be all these wannabes\u201d crowding around to get into his circle, he said, \u201cthe lobbyist types will be disappointed. ... Newsom never performed in that way. He has paid no interest to them. But he\u2019s smart enough, and sharp enough, to have talented folks seek him out.\u201d\n\nIn the final days of his gubernatorial campaign, camped out in the back of his big blue campaign bus, Newsom acknowledged that he\u2019d told his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, he\u2019d been feeling \u201cbutterflies,\u201d a combination of exhilaration and a sobering gut check as the reality of that challenge set in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been such a long, multiyear journey,\u201d said a reflective Newsom in the waning hours of a dawn-to-dusk campaign barnstorm across California that would seal his win. And now, the reality is here: \u201cThere\u2019s an ending,\u2019 he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real responsibility. That\u2019s the job.\u201d\n\nNewsom acknowledged that it\u2019s daunting to be following Jerry Brown, a man who\u2019s \u201ca master\u201d of California political dialect, calling him \u201cexceptionally gifted, exceptionally skilled ... one of the best political minds of our generation.\u201d\n\nBut as much as Newsom respects Brown, he has little time to waste\u2014there\u2019s a preliminary budget due on Dec 15, though he won\u2019t be formally sworn in until Jan. 7. \u201cI just want to get to work,\u201d he told POLITICO. \u201cI\u2019m not going to wait around for the first 100 days ... these transitions are pretty quick.\u201d\n\nNewsom is approaching his first budget, which gets reviewed by the Legislature in May, the way he approaches everything else: with deadly earnestness. It\u2019s \u201cyour first chance at a first impression ... demonstrably a reflection of your values,\u201d he said. And for one who has talked about prioritizing issues like early childhood education, he noted, it will be seen as a \u201cproof point\u201d of his commitments.\n\nFor months, Newsom has been quietly assembling 30 policy teams\u2014experts in academia, tech, business and government; the groups have been examining the challenges ahead in issues ranging from health care and climate change to more granular topics like cybersecurity, job automation and government procurement. Those efforts have produced a series of in-depth policy papers.\n\nSo far, Newsom said, \u201cI\u2019ve been focusing on \u2018how.\u2019\u201d As the governor-elect, \u201cI think the next phase is \u2018who.\u2019 \u2026 You can make big mistakes in a transition\u2014and often they\u2019re attached to personnel.\u201d\n\nJason Kinney, a longtime Newsom adviser, resigned his spot at California Strategies, a powerhouse state lobbying firm, to help the former mayor navigate what he acknowledges will be critical decisions ahead.\n\nAnd Newsom\u2019s first major picks, two veteran women in politics, have already won praise. His chief of staff\u2014and the head of his transition team\u2014will be Ann O\u2019Leary, a former policy adviser to Hillary Clinton. And Ana Matosantos, who served as budget director to both Govs. Jerry Brown and Arnold Schwarzenegger, will be his Cabinet secretary\u2014a key post that will serve as the new governor\u2019s chief contact to key government agencies and departments.\n\nFriends say Newsom, while seeking the advice and views of his trusted staffers, relishes the work of governing. He is known to read policy papers from the moment he wakes up, highlighting in yellow and crowding the margins with notes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been looking at these issues for a long time and he is so far ahead of most people coming into this office on a policy level\u2014because he really does love policy issues and he doesn\u2019t jump fast,\u201d said veteran Democratic consultant Gale Kaufman. \u201cHe\u2019s thoughtful in his approach.\u201d\n\nBill Whalen, a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution who was previously an adviser to Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, says the new job will require Newsom to tone down his national profile and go local. \u201cHe has to spend a lot of time talking to lawmakers, staying on top of bills, building relationships,\u201d he said. \u201cSacramento is a lot closer to Davis than to Davos. ... He has to take care of matters at home first.\u201d\n\nStill, Whalen says it\u2019s a good sign that Newsom is one of the few Democrats who in the past year has visited the conservative think tank, in part to explore the views of some of the nation\u2019s most preeminent economists and policy experts on the other side of the aisle. Many came away impressed with the depths of the discussion, he said.\n\nSuch efforts may assist Newsom in a big challenge ahead, Whalen suggests: controlling the pent-up spending demands of California\u2019s Democratic state Legislature, which chafed under Jerry Brown\u2019s trademark frugality and fiscal discipline.\n\n\u201cJerry has been the \u2018alpha dog\u2019 in Sacramento for the last eight years,\u201d pushing back on budget demands with tough vetoes \u2014 an approach that has helped Brown protect a budget that went from deficit to surplus on his watch. Says Whelan, \u201cCan a Gov. Newsom be the same big dog? Are the Democratic leaders of the legislature intimidated by Gavin Newsom or not?\u201d\n\nAssembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, at Newsom\u2019s victory party last week, noted Newsom\u2019s statements that he would not be \u201cprofligate\u201d and would try to follow in Jerry Brown\u2019s footsteps by keeping the Legislature in check when needed. \u201cThat\u2019s the governor\u2019s job\u2014to say no to us sometimes,\u201d he said, adding a pointed warning: \u201cAnd it\u2019s our job to say no to the governor sometimes. ... It\u2019s a balance of power. And I know that Gavin Newsom understands that.\u2019\u2019\n\nDemocrats who\u2019ve known him for years say Newsom won\u2019t have a problem saying no.\n\nThe former San Francisco mayor, during his tenure as the city\u2019s chief executive, gained an understanding of \u201cwhat it\u2019s like to veto legislation that pisses off your friends,\u201d said a longtime friend and adviser, Nathan Ballard, CEO of The Press Shop, a Bay Area media-strategy group run in partnership with veteran Democratic strategist P.J. Johnston.\n\nBut Newsom is also likely to carve out his own signature issues where he goes further than his predecessors. Former state Sen. Fran Pavley, who helped craft a landmark climate-change bill signed by Schwarzenegger, which mandated a cap on greenhouse gas emissions statewide and a 25 percent reduction by 2020, says she sees Newsom already looking ahead on how to advance the environmental agenda forged by Schwarzenegger and Jerry Brown.\n\nPavley says she\u2019s both energized and reassured by the news that Mary Nichols, who heads the California Air Resources Board\u2014and has been a key in resisting Trump\u2019s agenda aiming to roll back fuel emissions standards\u2014will stay on through at least 2020, when her current term ends. Nichols, who\u2019s been dubbed the state\u2019s \u201cclean air czar,\u2019\u2019 served as chair of the board under Schwarzenegger and has been widely viewed for decades as the most influential force behind the state\u2019s successful moves to dramatically reduce air pollution\u2014while advancing a cutting-edge climate change agenda. She says Newsom is strongly rumored to be preparing to address the issue of fracking\u2014representing a key departure from Brown, whose continued support made him the target of environmental groups.\n\nIt may be one of the areas where Newsom will immediately be challenged to make an early and bold, game-changing stroke\u2014much as he did in 2004 as a new mayor by legalizing same sex-marriage in San Francisco, says Willie Brown.\n\nThat decision put him on the national political map\u2014and sparked a national uproar. Republicans lambasted Newsom, as did some Democrats, like Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and many more\u2014like then-Sen. Barack Obama \u2014 declined to have photos taken with him in the immediate aftermath. Pundits predicted the end of his political career, but it was Newsom\u2019s prediction that marriage equality would be the law of the land someday \u2014 \u201cwhether you like it or not,\u201d he said \u2014 that turned out to be spot-on.\n\nBut Newsom cautions that recreating that \u201clightning in a bottle\u201d moment will be \u201ctough.\u201d He adds: \u201cThat issue chose me, I didn\u2019t choose it.\u201d\n\nBut even as he sought to tamp down expectations, Newsom noted that his campaign slogan was \u201cCourage, for a Change.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to be surprised with what they\u2019re getting,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying courage is always noble and righteous\u2014but it\u2019s an expression of a willingness to lean into issues\u201d when others \u201cmay be a little more reticent to do so.\u201d\n\nCarla Marinucci is a reporter.", "A Chinese woman adjusts a Chinese flag near U.S. flags before the start talks between the two nations in 2014. | Ng Han Guan/AFP/Getty Images POLITICO MONEY PODCAST How the China trade war could get very bad, very fast\n\nSubscribe to POLITICO Money on Apple Podcasts here. | Subscribe via Stitcher here.\n\nConsumers have not yet felt a major hit from President Donald Trump\u2019s trade battle with China.

Higher prices caused by tariffs could also push the Federal Reserve into more aggressive interest-rate hikes to fight inflation.\n\nAlso on the podcast, Palmer discusses the potential for Trump to slap tariffs on automobiles imported from Europe as well as the prospects that the next Congress, which will feature a Democratic House majority, will approve Trump\u2019s U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\n", "President Donald Trump thinks Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) would be a ferocious defender for him as the top Republican on the powerful House Judiciary Committee. | Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo Congress Trump meddles in McCarthy-Jordan leadership brawl\n\nOn the eve of Kevin McCarthy\u2019s long-awaited defeat of his nemesis, Rep. Jim Jordan, President Donald Trump is jumping into the fray to play peacemaker.\n\nTrump has privately urged the House majority leader to strike a deal with the conservative Freedom Caucus founder, who is challenging McCarthy for the minority leader post next Congress, multiple lawmakers and aides said. It remains unclear what exactly the deal would entail.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe discussions between the president and McCarthy about Jordan, which took place last week, set off a round of speculation among lawmakers inside the Capitol that Trump may try to push Jordan to become the top Republican lawmaker on the House Judiciary Committee, a panel expected to launch an array of Democratic investigations against the president \u2014 and possibly even an impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cJim Jordan will be the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee,\u201d top Trump ally Cory Lewandowski predicted Tuesday evening on MSNBC\u2019s Hardball.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

And Trump thinks Jordan would be a ferocious defender.\n\nBut McCarthy does not have authority to unilaterally appoint a lawmaker to any ranking member position. Rather, the decision is up to the Republican Steering Committee, a collection of members who do not like Jordan and may not take their cues from the White House.\n\nTrump\u2019s request puts McCarthy in a bind as he prepares to succeed Paul Ryan atop the GOP conference, which was crushed by Democrats on Election Day. Jordan derailed McCarthy\u2019s 2015 speakership bid and has been running against the California Republican to lead the House GOP for months. Jordan accused McCarthy, along with other GOP leaders, of losing the majority for Republicans.\n\nJordan is backed by an array of conservative special interest groups who have long been a thorn in leadership\u2019s side, and he also has the ear of the president. But Jordan has little chance of winning the minority leader race.\n\nThe California Republican does not need to strike a deal with Jordan to win the position. McCarthy says he has the votes. And in fact, his allies believe McCarthy benefits if he can show the president that he can defeat Jordan in what\u2019s effectively a popularity contest.\n\nThe vote for minority leader is set for Wednesday afternoon.\n\nJordan and McCarthy both declined to comment for this story. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe rare and unexpected presidential foray into internal House politics could scramble what, until now, had been a fairly low-key fight over the position. Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) is the leading contender to become the ranking Republican on Judiciary \u2014 though Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), a veteran of the Clinton impeachment battle, is also running.\n\nIndeed, the request could put McCarthy in a sensitive situation with some of his members. McCarthy is close with Collins, who is favored for the position and well-liked among his colleagues. Collins has been campaigning for the post for months, flying around the country to help GOP colleagues win re-election, crafting bipartisan bills to showcase his legislative chops \u2014 including a prison reform bill that is important to Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner \u2014 and wooing House leaders.\n\nBut Jordan has won the president\u2019s admiration in no small part because he\u2019s good on TV and is a fierce advocate of the president. Jordan appears regularly on Fox News and other networks to push the pro-Trump line. And the President has gushed that he\u2019s his \u201cwarrior\u201d \u2014 often to the annoyance of other House Republicans.\n\nSome Republicans have suggested there is a way to make all parties happy. Jordan is next in line on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, where Democrats are also readying a series of investigations into Trump and his administration. Jordan, who wanted the position in previous years, could be tapped to be the top GOP member on the committee, the Republicans say.\n\nBut it\u2019s possible Jordan loses out being the ranking Republican on either committee given his unpopularity in the GOP conference for tactics many considered divisive. Jordan espouses a hardline conservative agenda at every opportunity, has pushed for shutdowns and has derailed some of his colleagues\u2019 bipartisan legislative priorities in the name of ideological purity.\n\nHe may need McCarthy\u2019s or Trump\u2019s backing to get either job. McCarthy, as minority leader, has four votes on the Steering Committee.\n\nIt\u2019s an awkward situation for Trump as well as for McCarthy. Trump clearly likes both men, calling McCarthy to talk shop regularly while praising Jordan as well. The two House Republicans, however, have long butted heads.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee is likely to be the forum for the most high-profile investigations Trump will face in the Democratic Congress next year. The panel has a wide-ranging portfolio, and Democrats have signaled they'll use it to look at Trump's potential business conflicts of interest, his decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, allegations that Trump may have obstructed an investigation into his campaign's contacts with Russia and other sensitive matters.\n\nThe panel also has jurisdiction over the impeachment process, which could become a factor if special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation delivers allegations of misconduct. Dozens of Democrats already voted to advance an impeachment debate late last year, although they were in the minority and the vote was guaranteed to fail.\n\nDuring the final days of the campaign, Trump warned that a Democratic House would try to impeach him and used it as a rallying cry to his supporters. While Democrats have downplayed the possibility of impeachment, Trump\u2019s request underscores his intense focus on who will be leading the fight against Democratic investigations into his presidency.\n\nJordan, for his part, has slammed the long-running Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, accusing leaders of the FBI and Justice Department of anti-Trump bias that he said fueled their probe.\n\nDemocrats say Jordan and his supporters are trying to shield Trump from a legitimate investigation, in part by eroding public confidence in law enforcement institutions. Trump has fanned the controversy, often taking to Twitter to pan the Russia probe as a \"witch hunt\" against him.\n\nThe Judiciary committee\u2019s portfolio will include far more than investigations. Some of Trump's signature policy issues \u2014 including immigration \u2014 are overseen by the committee. Gun control legislation is also on the committee's docket, along with prison and sentencing issues, all of which Trump has weighed in on during his first two years in office.\n\n", "Jenny Ament/POLITICO Women Rule Podcast 'You fall in love with it': Kim Davis on hockey and her career in the NHL Davis had a career in finance before making a leap to sports\n\nSubscribe to Women Rule on Apple Podcasts here. | Subscribe via Stitcher here .\n\nAs American sports have grown more political in the Trump era -- with players protesting police violence by kneeling during the national anthem or teams protesting the administration by skipping ceremonial White House visits -- the National Hockey League has tried to balance its history of being largely apolitical with its values as an organization.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe have to have a point of view about who we are and what we stand for, as a set of principles,\u201d Kim Davis, an executive vice president at the NHL, told POLITICO\u2019s Women Rule podcast. \u201cAnd I think we have gotten very comfortable with that.\u201d\n\nDavis cited the positive outcome after Tampa Bay Lightning winger J.T.

House Democratic leaders aren't expected to move single-payer health care legislation soon, but PCCC's Adam Green isn\u2019t objecting yet. He did, however, emphasize the importance of a House vote on an option to buy into Medicare.\n\n\"Medicare for all, single payer, is the ceiling that a sizable number believe in, but not everyone is there yet,\" Green said in an interview, describing a Medicare option as a \"floor\" for the party's health care debate. \"At a minimum, we should be projecting that very strong floor to voters, not small-bore, technocratic tweaks\" to Obamacare.\n\nGreen wasn't alone in acknowledging that ambitious progressive goals like Medicare for all have yet to get broad buy-in from Democrats.\n\nIndivisible, the liberal network that gave the party\u2019s candidates valuable grass-roots support during the midterms, released a revamped edition of its popular guide for citizen-activists on Tuesday night that embraces a sense of pragmatism.\n\nIndivisible proposes a two-part \u201clegislative offense\u201d strategy to nudge the party forward: passing \u201cmessaging bills\u201d that spell out a compelling progressive agenda even if they won\u2019t be signed into law, and leveraging \u201cmust-pass bills\u201d to extract occasional wins from GOP senators.\n\n\u201cWe can safely assume that the vast majority of good legislation passed in the House will die in the Republican-controlled Senate,\u201d the former House Democratic aides who founded Indivisible write in the network's new guide. \u201cPlus, we would still need Donald Trump to sign any bill that clears Congress in order for it to become law.\u201d\n\nAnti-Trump groups also appear willing to give the House Democratic majority some space on the legislative front because they know their allies on Capitol Hill can hobble the White House through a litany of investigations. More than a half-dozen prospective committee chairs are sitting members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, its leaders noted at a news conference Monday.\n\n\u201cThere are two big prongs Democrats can pursue. One is resolute oversight and accountability of this administration to uncover lawless behavior and hold officials to account for abusing the public\u2019s trust,\u201d MoveOn.org\u2019s Washington director, Ben Wikler, said in an interview. \u201cThe second is passing unapologetically progressive measures that show the public what Democrats would do if they actually had power, particularly on issues like drug prices or minimum wage or infrastructure.\u201d\n\nNotably, Wikler didn\u2019t mention single-payer health care. Many prominent Democrats have endorsed Medicare for all, including multiple potential 2020 presidential hopefuls, but the party's candidates didn't necessarily embrace the issue in swing districts that proved critical to its new House majority. And Republicans are already working to turn the costly plan into a weapon against Democrats ahead of the 2020 campaign.\n\nNeera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, noted in an interview that \"who supported [Obamacare] and who opposed it was a resonant issue\" in multiple battleground races, rather than Medicare for all.\n\n\"A lot of what people were voting for was a check on Donald Trump,\" Tanden added.\n\nTo that end, an entire section of the new Indivisible guide is devoted to deterring Democrats from the \"dangerous\" appetite to cut deals with Trump and the GOP.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made an early appeal on that front Tuesday in a Fox News op-ed that touted \"opportunities\" to work together on bipartisan legislation next year.\n\n\"What we can make of those opportunities will depend on our Democratic colleagues,\" McConnell wrote. \"Will they choose to go it alone and simply make political points? Or will they choose to work together and actually make a difference?\"\n\nWorking with the GOP will be necessary if Democrats hope to get Trump's signature on an infrastructure package or prescription drugs legislation \u2014 two items often discussed as potential areas of agreement between the president and the new House majority next year. But progressive activists, even if they're not making big demands of leadership to tack left, are warning Democrats that reaching across the aisle isn't the best way to make their case to voters ahead of 2020.\n\n\"We\u2019re asking the American public to give us power. It\u2019s more about projecting what we would do with it than expecting that we would do something with Donald Trump and Senate Republicans,\" said PCCC\u2019s Green.\n\nAnd even as some high-profile liberal groups aren't issuing a list of demands, others on the left are putting Democrats on notice that they'll want quick movement next year.\n\n\"We think we should be reminding them of what progressives expect and pushing leadership to make room for folks who came in on that to lead on those issues,\" Heidi Hess, co-director of the left-leaning advocacy group CREDO Action, said in an interview. \"So, yes, we\u2019re going to push, not just on Medicare for all, but across the board.\"", "Trump\u2019s pick for ambassador to Saudi Arabia is John Abizaid, a retired four-star general who oversaw U.S. Central Command. | Win McNamee/Getty Images White House Trump taps ex-general for ambassador to Saudi Arabia\n\nPresident Donald Trump intends to nominate a prominent former army general to fill the vacant role of U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, a decision that comes nearly two years into his presidency and amid tensions with Riyadh.\n\nTrump\u2019s pick is John Abizaid, a retired four-star general who oversaw U.S. Central Command, a division that deals with the Middle East, according to a statement issued by the White House on Tuesday.

The state of Maryland on Tuesday filed the first legal challenge seeking to overturn Whitaker\u2019s appointment, while on Capitol Hill newly empowered House Democrats are already making plans to have the acting attorney general appear as one of their first witnesses when the next Congress launches in January.\n\nThe uproar over the appointment, which effectively removes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as Mueller\u2019s primary supervisor, has put Whitaker in a difficult spot, trapped between setting off a political firestorm by clipping Mueller\u2019s wings and angering a president intent on having him do just that.\n\nEven Trump\u2019s Justice Department is wavering about whether Whitaker will do the deed the president wanted him for.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

With Mueller, it\u2019s such a politically fraught field, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to do anything than try to move it along.\u201d\n\nLanny Davis, the former Bill Clinton White House crisis manager, said that if Whitaker were to follow the president\u2019s wishes and meddle with the Mueller probe, he would be susceptible both to legal fallout and long-term reputational problems.\n\n\u201cThis guy is vulnerable criminally. He\u2019s vulnerable morally. He\u2019s just plain out vulnerable,\u201d said Davis, who is now representing Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen in his criminal proceedings.\n\nThere is also the fact that Mueller\u2019s investigation may be too far along to merely smother it. A Washington-based defense lawyer representing a senior Trump official in the Russia investigation said Whitaker couldn\u2019t make decisions \u201cbased on his seat-of-the-pants preferences.\u201d\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s work is now into its 18th month and includes guilty pleas involving former senior Trump aides and indictments against more than two dozen Russian officials accused of sabotaging the 2016 presidential election.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) told POLITICO on Tuesday: \u201cTo try to stop it when it\u2019s nearly concluded would be a mistake.\u201d\n\nThe new constraints on Whitaker represent a harsh reality check for a White House that helped kick-start his promotion back in August 2017. That\u2019s when the White House counsel at the time, Don McGahn, pressured Sessions into hiring the little-known attorney as his new chief of staff, replacing Jody Hunt, who had just left to run the Justice Department\u2019s civil division.\n\nSessions, stung just weeks before by a series of humiliating Trump tweets , came away from his interactions with McGahn with an impression that he had little choice but to accede to the White House\u2019s demands, according to two sources familiar with Sessions\u2019 thinking.\n\nWhitaker had others pushing for his hiring, too.\n\nThe Federalist Society\u2019s executive director, Leonard Leo, whose stock has been high in the Trump White House for his behind-the-scenes vetting of potential Supreme Court picks, recommended Whitaker to McGahn.\n\nTrump also liked Whitaker\u2019s cable television appearances and his attack-dog style challenging Mueller\u2019s investigation. While working for Sessions, Whitaker used his post to engender the president\u2019s belief that Trump had a friend in him. The two men also bonded over football \u2014 Whitaker was a tight end on the University of Iowa team that went to the 1991 Rose Bowl.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s promotion has been anything but smooth. Trump last Friday told reporters outside the White House that he didn\u2019t even know the new acting attorney general, though in an Oct. 11 interview on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d the president called him a \u201cgreat guy,\u201d adding, \u201cI mean, I know Matt Whitaker.\u201d\n\nSome of the president\u2019s own aides, including members of his legal team, expressed frustration on Monday that neither the White House nor the Justice Department had made any attempt to put an end to the controversy generated by Whitaker\u2019s appointment by issuing a statement about Whitaker\u2019s views on the Mueller probe or his role overseeing it \u2014 making clear he had no intention of curtailing it or providing some window into his thinking.\n\nOthers said that although they believed it was unlikely Whitaker would take aim at Mueller, issuing a public statement saying as much would infuriate the president, who would view it as a betrayal akin to Sessions\u2019 initial recusal from the investigation in early 2017.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment for this article.\n\nBut Whitaker\u2019s appointment has created anything but certainty for Trump and the Russia investigation.\n\nThe Maryland motion on Tuesday asking a federal judge to name Rosenstein the acting attorney general argues that Whitaker\u2019s promotion violates a constitutional provision requiring Senate confirmation for top positions like attorney general.\n\nSenate Democrats have said they\u2019re considering their own lawsuit, and the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), has already promised to make Whitaker the first witness when the new Congress convenes in January.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s totally unqualified,\u201d Nadler told CNN on Sunday. \u201cAnd his only qualification seems to be that he wants to be \u2014 that the president wants him to be the hatchet man to destroy the Mueller investigation.\u201d\n\nThe shakeup at Justice is also creating internal demands on its own lawyers.\n\nThe department on Tuesday was reportedly expected to finalize a legal opinion backing Whitaker\u2019s appointment.\n\nMueller\u2019s office faces its own deadline next Monday to tell a federal appellate court panel what the changes atop the department mean for a lawsuit that seeks to knock the special counsel out of his job on constitutional grounds.\n\nNadler on Tuesday also sent a letter to Whitaker and FBI Director Christopher Wray seeking responses to more than 100 information requests from Democratic lawmakers that have gone unanswered while the party has been in the House minority, including details about \u201cimproper communications\u201d between the White House and Justice Department.\n\nAnd Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the minority leader, made clear on Tuesday the position of Senate Democrats: There are \u201cserious questions,\u201d he said, about whether Whitaker\u2019s appointment \u2014 rather than that of the special counsel \u2014 is constitutional.\n\nBurgess Everett contributed to this report.", "When Sen.

But CNN has likely now claimed the advantage by moving the battle to the courtroom.\n\nFirst Amendment lawyers say courts have a history of defending access for journalists, and the White House\u2019s shifting justifications won\u2019t help it in the coming legal fight over the decision to revoke correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass last week. CNN and Acosta filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to have his credentials restored, and a judge has scheduled the first hearing for Wednesday afternoon.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a serious claim,\u201d said Floyd Abrams, the renowned First Amendment lawyer who represented The New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything that is likely to lead to a victory for the White House.\u201d\n\nMorning Media Your guide to the media circus \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

He said that in all of those cases, including one from 1977 involving a reporter seeking a White House pass, judges have ruled on the side of journalists.\n\n\u201cThe core principles are you can\u2019t deny access because you disagree with the views expressed in the questions,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cYou can\u2019t deny access because you wish to retaliate for past questions.\u201d\n\nThe CNN case is likely to hinge on that very issue: whether Judge Timothy J. Kelly, appointed by Trump in 2017, believes the White House\u2019s claims that it did not strip Acosta of his pass because of objections to his coverage, but for other reasons that could be deemed permissible, such as security concerns.\n\nInitially, Sanders accused Acosta of \u201cplacing his hands on\u201d a White House aide during a news conference, though the contact appeared incidental on video replays. But Trump later stepped on that argument when he said the incident wasn\u2019t \u201coverly \u2026 horrible\u201d and indicated that his real issue with Acosta was a lack of \u201crespect\u201d for the White House.\n\nOn Tuesday, in a statement responding to CNN\u2019s suit, Sanders shifted focus again, saying the issue was that Acosta \u201cphysically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions.\u201d She added, \u201cThis was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional,\u201d she said.\n\nThe government has yet to file any official response to the lawsuit. Per an order from Kelly, the response is due at 11 a.m. Wednesday. But the shifting explanations for why Acosta lost his access could indicate to the judge that these explanations are covers for the true rationale \u2014 that the administration simply didn\u2019t like his coverage or style, said Nathan Siegel, a First Amendment lawyer with Davis Wright Tremaine who previously served as in-house counsel for ABC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely relevant,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cThe fact that the defendants\u2019 explanation shifts is often evidence that it\u2019s a pretext for the real reason.\u201d\n\nAbrams agreed that CNN\u2019s lawyers could exploit this sort of opening, as did Harvard Law School First Amendment professor Rebecca Tushnet, who said, \u201cThe fact that the government\u2019s story keeps changing might raise red flags.\u201d\n\nEugene Volokh, a professor at the UCLA School of Law focused on the First Amendment, agreed that the network is in a strong position. \u201cCNN probably has enough there to argue that the decision to exclude him was based on his viewpoint and not just on supposedly mistreating the intern or hogging the mic,\u201d he said. \u201cThen there needs to be a determination of what the motivation was, and the case should go forward to get that determination.\u201d\n\nThe case could create even more legal headaches for a president already facing a mountain of them. In addition to the Mueller investigation, Trump is embroiled in lawsuits related to his business and other activities before he reached the White House, as well as challenges to his immigration policies. Both he and his top lieutenants \u2014 in addition to Sanders, chief of staff John Kelly, deputy chief of staff Bill Shine and Secret Service director Randolph Alles are also named in the suit \u2014 could be asked for records, like their emails, or deposed as part of the CNN case, lawyers said.\n\nTrump's public comments have complicated his legal fights before. In courtroom arguments over the administration's ban on travel to the U.S. from certain countries, opposing lawyers argued that his tweets about Muslims showed the real motivation behind his policy decisions.\n\nTrump has repeatedly singled out CNN for criticism as he complains about his media coverage. Even before he took office, he dubbed Acosta \"fake news\" during a press conference and refused to take a question from him. But revoking a reporter's press credentials was considered by the White House press corps a dramatic escalation and virtually unheard-of step.\n\nIn the lawsuit, CNN and Acosta advance two main arguments for restoring his credentials. First, they say the White House revoked the reporter\u2019s pass because of his coverage and viewpoint, and not for any of its other stated reasons. Second, they say the White House failed to follow the prescribed process for withdrawing a reporter\u2019s pass, as set out by a 1977 case in which Robert Sherrill, a reporter for The Nation, sued the Secret Service because it denied him access to the White House complex.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Sherrill\u2019s favor, declaring that the Secret Service must have a legitimate reason for barring a reporter and cannot do it \"arbitrarily or for less than compelling reasons.\"\n\nTo ensure that such reasons existed in the future, the court laid out a series of steps that administrations must go through \u2014 including giving reporters written notice and a chance to present their own argument \u2014 before denying a press pass.\n\nIn the complaint filed Tuesday, CNN and Acosta said that they were given no warning of or chance to reply to the decision to pull his pass.\n\nCNN is pushing for the court to restore Acosta's access quickly while it weighs the larger questions in the case. On Tuesday, Kelly announced a 3:30 p.m. hearing the next day to consider CNN\u2019s request for a temporary injunction that would return Acosta\u2019s press pass.\n\nTushnet, the Harvard professor, said she expected the judge to move quickly. First Amendment cases often do, she said, because plaintiffs typically cannot be compensated for their loss of speech with money, or any other conventional remedy.\n\n\u201cFirst Amendment rights are usually considered pretty important,\u201d she said, \u201cand injury to them is generally considered irreparable.\u201d\n\n", "Larry Kudlow lashed out at White House trade adviser Peter Navarro after Navarro, a trade protectionist, took aim at Wall Street and corporate influencers pushing a less aggressive stance against China. | AP Photo/Andrew Harnik White House Staff anger spills over at White House A drumbeat of exits is mixing with Trump\u2019s anger after the midterms and a much-criticized trip to Europe.\n\nBottled-up hostility in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration flowed to the surface Tuesday during a remarkable 12-hour period following an awkward midterm d\u00e9tente and tense trip to Paris over which the president is still seething.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like an episode of \u2018Maury,\u2019\u201d one former Trump aide observed to POLITICO as the spectacle unfolded. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s missing is a paternity test.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAt the White House, Trump appeared poised to dismiss Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, a source of personal frustration for months over what Trump views as weak leadership on border security and other immigration enforcement policies he\u2019s sought to implement.\n\nThe fresh round of backbiting and post-midterm turnover could also sweep out Trump\u2019s chief of staff John Kelly, a close Nielsen ally, and see him replaced with Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Nick Ayers, who is re-emerging as a leading candidate, according to several White House officials and others close to the presidential orbit.\n\nOn Tuesday, the West Wing staff morass \u2014 which had long been building but which the president personally subordinated to put up a unified front for the midterms \u2014 spilled over to the East Wing, with first lady Melania Trump openly calling for the ouster of one of the top officials on the National Security Council in a rare public rebuke.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

But some conceded that the drumbeat of exits, the threat of subpoenas from the Russia probe and anticipated investigations by a newly empowered Democratic House \u2014 along with a raft of negative media attention in recent days \u2014 were taking a heavy toll on not only the president, but also on the aides and advisers' thinning ranks.\n\nTrump himself did not tip his hand on any of the higher-ranking staff moves. But at a diya-lighting ceremony in the White House commemorating the Hindu festival Diwali, he announced the nomination of Neomi Rao, an administrator with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, to fill the vacancy left in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals by Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s move to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn private and on Twitter, Trump succumbed to darker forces, fixating on the media as late midterm returns continued to tilt in favor of Democrats, bolstering their House majority and making what seemed on election night like a history-defying achievement for the president and Senate Republicans a decidedly routine showing.\n\nTrump has kept a light public schedule while stewing over unflattering domestic and international headlines, all amid a First Amendment-focused lawsuit that CNN filed against the president and top administration officials on Tuesday demanding that its correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s access to the White House be restored.\n\nThe internal upheaval came on the heels of Trump\u2019s trip to Paris, where European leaders distanced themselves from his rhetoric and President Emmanuel Macron of France implicitly rebuked Trump in front of 70 other world leaders during an Armistice Day ceremony by criticizing the very idea of nationalism.\n\nAlready dismissive of Trump, Parisians barely paid attention to the U.S. president during his visit except to mock him. Two French tabloids over the weekend ran cover photos of Trump along with the headlines: \u201cWhy Trump threatens us\u201d and \u201cMacron\u2019s other front.\u201d\n\nThe fallout from the Paris trip clearly remains on Trump\u2019s mind, since he tweeted five times on Tuesday morning about Macron, trade with France and his own canceled trip to an American cemetery outside Paris because of overcast, rainy weather.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter . \u201cHe was just trying to get onto another subject. By the way, there is no country more Nationalist than France, very proud people-and rightfully so!........\u201d\n\nHe blamed the Secret Service for the cancellation of the cemetery visit \u2014 contradicting what his press secretary told reporters over the weekend, that Trump himself did not want to cause a traffic jam.\n\nBut it was the staff machinations that consumed Trump\u2019s orbit, where advisers noted that with a fast-moving and fickle president, few things are certain.\n\nAyers, who is 36 and has three young children, has weighed returning to the private sector in Georgia, where he\u2019s held on to his house. There have also been discussions about moving him to Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nNielsen\u2019s pending exit, meantime, seemed as close to a done deal as could be described. One Republican close to the White House characterized her departure as \u201cimminent\u201d \u2014 within the next week or two \u2014 and indicated that once her firing or resignation is announced, she will leave the administration within hours or days, similar to the recent firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nNielsen has clashed with the administration\u2019s hard-line immigration hawks, including Stephen Miller and staffers throughout DHS and the Justice Department. They have been critical of her inability to stem the ongoing flow of immigrants into the U.S., as well as her defense of the administration\u2019s decision to separate migrant parents from children when she appeared at the lectern during a news briefing.\n\n\u201cThere is no love lost between Nielsen and other political appointees,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that has advocated for far stricter immigration laws. \u201cShe and some of her staff have been considered more of an obstacle than a help.\u201d\n\nTrump is considering Thomas Homan, former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to succeed her, POLITICO reported. Other possible replacements include Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and David Pekoske, administrator of the Transportation Security Administration. Another name in the mix is Maj. Gen. Vincent Coglianese, who runs the Marine Corps Installations Command.\n\nInterpersonal conflicts have dogged Ricardel, the deputy national security adviser, since the days of the Trump transition, when she wanted the job of undersecretary for policy at the Defense Department, only to have Secretary Jim Mattis block her, a former transition official said. Eventually, Ricardel gave up landing a job at the Pentagon and found a spot at the Department of Commerce, for which the Senate confirmed her. Then, when Bolton took over as national security adviser, he brought her over to the White House as his No. 2. Her potential departure will be a political boon to Mattis and his team, the transition official added.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration has been so consistently off the rails that days like today just blend into everything else,\u201d another former White House official concluded. \u201cThat in and of itself may be the biggest indictment of all.\u201d\n\nAndrew Restuccia, Eliana Johnson, Ben Schreckinger, Gabby Orr, Daniel Lippman and Ted Hesson contributed to this report.", "New York Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez decried the \"race-to-the-bottom competition\" for corporate favors for companies like Amazon. | Mary Schwalm/AP Photo Technology Amazon\u2019s enemies swarm as its D.C. clout swells Bezos\u2019 presence in Northern Virginia and New York will enhance his company\u2019s sway.

Trump also regularly rages at The Washington Post, which Bezos owns.\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers are seeking an investigation into the company\u2019s connections at the Defense Department, where Amazon is competing for a $10 billion Pentagon contract that would add to its already-massive cloud computing empire. Progressive lawmakers and labor unions have taken aim at the company over workplace safety, employee pay and, indeed, government-subsidized expansions. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) weighed in earlier this year with the BEZOS Act, a bill that would tax corporations for every dollar their low-wage workers receive in government assistance.\n\nAll this comes as the company's fortunes increasingly depend on decisions in Washington: Amazon is still awaiting federal approval to use drones to deliver packages, nearly five years after Bezos announced its plans on \"60 Minutes,\" for example. At the same time, Bezos\u2019 separate company Blue Origin is seeking a role in the president\u2019s push for an American renaissance in space.\n\nAmazon\u2019s industry rivals have weighed in, too.

The group\u2019s first action will be a lawsuit challenging tax collection practices that benefit Amazon and hurt its small sellers, guild founder Paul Rafelson told POLITICO on Tuesday.\n\nEven WikiLeaks has gotten in on the anti-Amazon game, publishing in October a confidential document that purports to map the location of the company\u2019s data centers.

Mark Warner is the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee and a proponent of tighter oversight of the tech industry, an issue that will greatly affect Amazon.\n\nSome of those elected leaders were quick to offer praise for Amazon's choice Tuesday.\n\n\"We've seen that major investments like these can bring not only thousands of direct jobs but also lead to job growth in other industries,\" Warner said in a statement. \"As we welcome Amazon's new investment in Virginia, we must commit to implementing this announcement in a way that will benefit the whole region and all of the Commonwealth.\u201d\n\nIn the House, Amazon's Long Island City location will fall within the district of Rep. Carolyn Maloney, the top Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee. Democratic Rep. Don Beyer, the No. 2 Democrat on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, will be the company's representative from Virginia.\n\nAmazon employees also are likely to settle down in districts represented by New York Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, who is making a bid to lead the House Democratic Caucus, and Jerry Nadler, the presumed chair of the House Judiciary Committee, which would oversee antitrust hearings.\n\n\u201cThey're going to have a footprint in major areas that have big delegations and have tended to have more influential members,\" said Bruce Freed, president and co-founder of Center for Political Accountability, which advocates for transparency in corporate political spending. \"It means they're going to be much more sensitive to Amazon\u2019s interests or its needs.\"\n\nEven before HQ2 mania, Amazon\u2019s company\u2019s lobbying presence in Washington had expanded rapidly. The company spent $12.8 million to influence federal policy last year, a record it\u2019s on pace to smash again this year. That\u2019s an increase of more than 400 percent since 2012, when the company spent a modest $2.5 million on lobbying.\n\nThe company's policy portfolio has expanded along with its business interests, from entertainment and cloud computing to groceries and self-driving cars. Its traditional e-commerce issues \u2014 online sales tax, electronic payments and data privacy \u2014 have been joined over time by copyright infringement and music licensing, drone testing, artificial intelligence and federal I.T. modernization.\n\nTo up its government game, Amazon has been hosting Washington decision makers at its Seattle headquarters, flooding a company Twitter feed with images of lawmakers at HQ1, including Speaker Paul Ryan, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Democratic Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell of Washington state, and Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.) in recent months. State and local lawmakers stop in at Amazon offices and fulfillment centers in Michigan, Indiana, Virginia, Arizona and Georgia, to name a few.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis got his Bezos-led tour in August 2017, as Amazon was being drawn into a war with other tech giants over the $10 billion contract to move Pentagon data to the cloud.

On Wednesday, the members-elect will be introduced to their colleagues at a Democratic Caucus meeting, a lengthy process that will put them onstage with Pelosi.

Govs. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania have weighed in, as have former Vice President Al Gore and former Secretary of State and longtime Democratic Sen. John Kerry, according to Democratic aides.\n\nAnd Pelosi has been meeting in private \u2014 and calling \u2014 these lawmakers-to-be, although her aides won\u2019t provide a list of who she\u2019s sat down with this week.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of the \u201cPelosi for Speaker\u201d blitz, with the California Democrat showing off every trick in her vast arsenal of persuasive tactics as she works to round up the votes she needs to win two upcoming votes: one inside the Democratic Caucus on Nov. 28, and the critical one on the House floor Jan. 3. While Pelosi will easily get a majority inside the Democratic Caucus, how she handles that vote is crucial. Letting some members and members-elect vote against her so they can say they opposed her, for example, would then free them up to back her on the floor. That will set the stage for the run-up to the Jan. 3 vote, where the stakes will be far higher.\n\nRep.-elect Veronica Escobar (D-Texas) \u2014 who was at the Progressive Caucus session on Tuesday \u2014 is supporting Pelosi's speakership bid. Escobar said their relationship began this summer, when Pelosi visited El Paso and attended a fundraiser for her campaign. Escobar will be meeting one-on-one with Pelosi later in the week.\n\n\"She and I have spoken a lot about border issues, immigration issues, El Paso issues, trade,\" Escobar said.\n\nFor Pelosi, the incoming freshman class \u2014 at least 33 strong right now, but still growing \u2014 is immensely important. Without the backing of an overwhelming majority of this class, she can\u2019t be speaker.\n\nYet a number of Democratic candidates expressed reservations about Pelosi and the entire House Democratic leadership during the campaign. And they\u2019ve repeatedly been pressed this week whether they would vote against her on the floor in the speaker roll call on Jan. 3, either by reporters, their future colleagues or party leaders.\n\nAlready four members-elect have declared publicly that they would oppose her both inside the Democratic Caucus on Nov. 28 and on the floor: Abigail Spanberger (Va.), Jason Crow (Colo.), Joe Cunningham (S.C.) and Max Rose (N.Y.).\n\n\u201cI am not voting for her \u2014 no if, ands or buts, under any circumstances,\u201d Rose said during an appearance on Fox News.\n\nThat comes on top of eight Democratic incumbents who've already declared their opposition to Pelosi, even on the House floor, meaning a dozen no votes are out there already. With a Democratic margin in the next Congress of anywhere from 15 to 20 seats expected next year, Pelosi can\u2019t afford to lose many more.\n\nPelosi has dispatched Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), a colonel in the Air Force Reserve, to try to win over veterans who are currently against Pelosi or likely to vote against her, according to multiple Democratic sources. Lieu has been trying to persuade incoming freshmen Crow, Rose, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Chissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania \u2014 all ex-military \u2014 to vote against Pelosi in caucus but for her on the House floor, according to sources familiar with those conversations.\n\nLieu, who is close with VoteVets \u2014 an organization that financially supported these candidates \u2014 is not twisting arms. But Lieu is trying to convince these incoming freshmen that they have options other than going all-out against Pelosi.\n\nPelosi's efforts are paying off, although there remains a lot of work to be done.\n\nRep.-elect Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) said she's had two phone conversations with Pelosi, including a congratulatory call after she won her election, and she described those early interactions as \"really positive.\"\n\nBut Tlaib noted she hadn't made a final decision on whether she'll support Pelosi for speaker. \"She\u2019s willing to listen, and that\u2019s what I ask for right now at this point,\" Tlaib said.\n\nRep.-elect Deb Haaland (D-N.M.) said she met with Pelosi on Monday for an introductory discussion and intends to support her. \"It\u2019s hard to believe that the Affordable Care Act that has helped millions and millions of Americans would have passed without her,\" Haaland said. \"I thinks she\u2019s a strong leader, and that\u2019s what we need right now.\"\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/795/1155968404_5859496769001_5859491003001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nRep.-elect Angie Craig (D-Minn.), who knocked off GOP Rep. Jason Lewis, hasn't yet committed to supporting Pelosi but said she intends to support the Democratic Caucus' pick. That will be Pelosi.\n\n\"So far there\u2019s one person running and I\u2019m certainly voting for a Democrat, so there you go,\" Craig said, noting that she had been in contact with Pelosi during the campaign because she was one of the party's featured \"Red-to-Blue\" candidates.\n\nPelosi also showed her deftness in dealing with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the highly touted progressive star who knocked off Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) \u2014 once viewed as potential party leader \u2014 during her run for Congress.\n\nOcasio-Cortez turned up at a Tuesday morning protest by climate change activists right outside Pelosi\u2019s office, with a posse of reporters trailing her. Pelosi \u2014 who has recommended that the House bring back the select committee on climate change she first created eight years ago \u2014 had already talked with Ocasio-Cortez about the issue and moved fast to defuse Tuesday's protest.\n\n\u201cI have spoken with @NancyPelosi about how our commitments to climate change should take shape in the 116th Congress,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez informed her 1 million-plus followers on Twitter. \u201cHer office has responded quickly, and she has recommended the reinstatement of the Select Committee on Climate Change.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez described Pelosi as \"profoundly focused\" on a progressive agenda but said she's waiting to make a final decision on whether to support the California Democrat for speaker. Ocasio-Cortez noted top progressive leaders in the House plan to meet with Pelosi on Thursday to discuss next year's agenda. Ocasio-Cortez said she'd await the results of that meeting and is hoping for more details on the select committee, but also told reporters she's \"looking forward to us working together.\"\n\nWhile Pelosi's future is by far the biggest issue facing the party as they get ready for 2019, she's not the only one lobbying freshmen this week.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), who has already locked down the votes to be majority leader next year, held a reception for group at the Library of Congress on Tuesday night, following by a \"candlelight tour\" of the Capitol. Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 House Democrat, and Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado \u2014 who are vying for majority whip \u2014 have also reached out to the new group of lawmakers. Clyburn is heavily favored to win that race.\n\nBut the battle for speaker remains the most dramatic contest. And despite her detractors, Pelosi has a loyal following built from years of legislating.\n\n\u201cThey know a first-rate leader when they see one,\u201d said Florida Rep.-elect Donna Shalala on Tuesday. The former secretary of the Health and Human Services Department and college president is a longtime Pelosi friend, and she portrayed backing Pelosi as a no-brainer.\n\n\"There are a 100,000 [people] in my district who have health care because of Nancy Pelosi,\" Shalala said. \"I have known her for a long time, and I intend to vote for her.\"\n\n", "\"Is [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer going to shut down the government over border security?

With Mueller\u2019s probe on Russian inteference in the 2016 election winding down and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) loath to bring up a standalone Mueller-protection bill, Democrats argue it could be their last chance to shield the special counsel from Trump.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMeanwhile, the president and his GOP allies are asking for a significant funding boost for border security in order for Trump to sign the government spending bill. Senate Republicans are advocating for $5 billion, while the outgoing House GOP majority has pushed for as much as $25 billion \u2014 figures that Democrats oppose absent a broader deal on immigration.\n\nIf the two sides can't come to terms, part of the government would shut down.

Senate Democrats have signaled they could support $1.6 billion in border security money, though Trump and Republicans want more.\n\nCongress took some of the sting out of a potential shutdown earlier this year by agreeing to funding for three-quarters of the government through next fall. But Homeland Security and several other departments were left out, and their funding is set to expire in December.\n\nThe prospect of even a partial funding lapse gives each party significant leverage to fight for its policy goals on two of the most divisive issues facing Congress.\n\nWhen Congress set up the December showdown over some departments' funding, the idea was to postpone a fight over the border wall until after the midterms. But a new issue has emerged in the past week: Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced out and Democrats say they are not confident that acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker will protect Mueller from the president.\n\nSchumer said Tuesday that Democrats will \u201cattempt to add legislation to the must-pass spending bill in the lame duck session that will prevent acting Attorney General Whitaker from interfering with the Mueller investigation.\u201d And other Democrats insisted that a bipartisan bill to protect the special counsel, which was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in April, must be on the agenda in the lame duck.\n\n\u201cIt needs to happen now. Every day that goes by the special counsel is at risk,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). \u201cThe Republicans assured us that the special counsel would be fully protected. And now the only way that we can guarantee that is if we pass a bill by a huge majority in the House and the Senate.\u201d\n\nWarren and other Democrats said that the Mueller provision doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be in the spending bill. They just want a vote on the proposal during the lame-duck session.\n\n\u201cWhat would be acceptable to me is McConnell bringing our bill to the floor,\u201d said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \u201cThat would make me satisfied.\u201d\n\nMcConnell has said the bill is unnecessary, a view shared by most Republicans. Even Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who supports the measure, said that while he\u2019d vote for it on the floor, he would not insist it come up in the lame duck.\n\nWith McConnell unlikely to take action on the Mueller protection plan on its own, Schumer is suggesting that Democrats use their leverage over spending to ensure it passes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame them, politically they can make a lot of fuss over it. ... To be honest with you, there\u2019s not any reason to worry about it. Any president who would dump [Mueller] would be in real trouble,\u201d said outgoing Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah).\n\nAs Democrats maneuver on Mueller, Republicans are eyeing a big border wall funding boost. Hatch said that means more than $5 billion that Senate GOP leaders had previously sought.\n\n\u201cI think everybody wants to do border wall funding in a bigger way,\u201d said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 GOP leader who is expected to be promoted to whip during Wednesday\u2019s leadership elections.\n\nHouse Democratic aides say the party will take a stand against a Trump-style, physical concrete wall. But they're open to a border security deal like the one agreed to early this year, which included new fencing that Republicans described as wall money. Plus, Democrats would rather clinch a spending deal now rather than haggle with it in January as they organize their new House majority.\n\nBut Democratic leaders say they aren't willing to go beyond the $1.6 billion that was agreed to earlier this year.\n\n\"We think that's more than adequate for reasonable investment in border security,\" said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). \"At this point, [Trump] can't spend it. He can't spend it responsibly. We know it's a lead in to the 2020 cycle.\"\n\nHouse Republicans have already crushed multiple Democratic attempts to protect Mueller\u2019s investigation by adding language to spending bills taken up at the committee level. Since Trump took office, Democrats on the powerful House Appropriations Committee have twice tried to force language that would block the Department of Justice from any attempt to \u201cobstruct, hinder, frustrate, impede, or prevent\u201d Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nHouse Democrats don\u2019t believe House Republicans will go along with the bill to protect the special counsel. But with the House changing hands and unpredictable leadership elections underway, lawmakers are prepared for just about anything to happen ahead of Dec. 7.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what the House is going to do,\" said Sen.

And once again, America\u2019s eyes are rolling.\n\nThis time, the object of scorn is the county\u2019s perennially troubled elections department, which was under fire for missing deadlines, mishandling ballots and mismanaging elections even before its slow and erratic vote-counting after last week\u2019s midterms. But a year before Broward Election Supervisor Brenda Snipes became a target for national ridicule, a similarly harsh spotlight fell on the county\u2019s sheriff, Scott Israel, over his department\u2019s botched response to the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Broward\u2019s school system also served time under the national media microscope after the Parkland shooting, for its inadequate response to multiple warning signs about the shooter.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThese aren\u2019t new problems for this Democratic stronghold of 2 million residents crammed between the Everglades and the Atlantic Ocean, which got its name from the colorful and corrupt turn-of-the-century governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward. Snipes got her job after Broward\u2019s last elections supervisor was removed from office for incompetence in 2003. A previous county sheriff went to jail in 2007. And a grand jury castigated Broward\u2019s school board for \u201cgross mismanagement and ineptitude\u201d after multiple corruption scandals in 2011. So far, no one has produced a shred of evidence to support President Donald Trump\u2019s allegations that Broward Democrats are trying to steal the midterm elections through a \u201cmassively infected\u201d recount process, but he wasn\u2019t wrong when he told reporters: \u201cIf you look at Broward County, they have a horrible history.\u201d\n\nIn a state that\u2019s not exactly known for its good-government ethic, Broward does seem to produce a disproportionate share of political scandals, from a school board member who stashed her bribes in a restaurant doggie bag to a state representative who billed his legal clients for the time he spent having sex with them. It\u2019s only fitting that Broward resident Roger Stone is under investigation for his role in the WikiLeaks hack that forced Broward Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to resign as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Florida always seems to play a key role in America\u2019s messes, from the 2000 presidential recount to the 2008 financial crisis, and metropolitan Fort Lauderdale\u2019s densely populated county is carving out a niche as Florida\u2019s Florida.\n\nSo what\u2019s the matter with Broward? Republicans tend to blame one-party Democratic rule, and even some Democrats agree that the lack of serious partisan competition has led to bad incentives and bad habits for county leaders, just as uninterrupted Republican rule at the state level has helped make Tallahassee\u2019s political culture dysfunctional. Broward\u2019s decentralized political structure, with a new and largely ceremonial mayor chosen every year from a nine-member county commission, has also reduced accountability: Broward\u2019s independent fiefdoms like the election office, sheriff\u2019s department and schools are essentially free to run wild. Broward\u2019s public health system has been particularly problematic. Its CEO committed suicide in 2016 amid a federal investigation into shady contracts, and his successor, who got the job despite having a degree from a defunct diploma mill and despite being under indictment, recently resigned after less than a year in office.\n\nBroward County is probably best known for the sun-kissed Fort Lauderdale beaches immortalized in the 1960 spring break movie Where the Boys Are, even though Fort Lauderdale is now a relatively staid family destination where the boys haven\u2019t been in decades. The county is now defined by the surrounding cluster of increasingly diverse suburbs carved out of Everglades swampland. \u201cBrowardization\u201d has become a Florida term of art for overdeveloped and auto-dependent sprawl. It\u2019s no coincidence that the only Fortune 500 company headquartered in this traffic-choked county is AutoNation; it\u2019s also no coincidence that the mad-as-hell novelist and columnist Carl Hiaasen, the bard of Florida\u2019s corruption and environmental devastation, grew up in Plantation in west Broward.\n\nStill, Broward isn\u2019t Florida\u2019s only county that\u2019s been Browardized, or for that matter America\u2019s only county with one-party rule or decentralized governance. It might just be a place where weird stuff happens to happen, like last month\u2019s arrest in Plantation of the Trump supporter who tried to mail pipe bombs to Wasserman Schultz and other prominent Democrats, or this summer\u2019s instantly viral spat in Hallandale where the mayor accused a commissioner of making a living off \u201csphincter bleaching.\u201d When it became clear that the latest Florida recount frenzy would revolve around Broward as well, locals did not seem overly gobsmacked. They\u2019re accustomed to scenes that feel ripped out of a Hiaasen novel.\n\n\u201cWe take the cake on crazy in Broward,\u201d says Richard DeNapoli, a local attorney and Republican state committeeman. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s surprised that we\u2019re in the middle of another embarrassment.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s certainly no surprise that Broward is in the middle of another election embarrassment. Snipes has been involved in so many snafus that the Miami Herald published a story on her agency four days before the midterms titled \u201cInside the Most Controversial Elections Department in Florida.\u201d In recent years, her office has sent out mail-in ballots that were missing a constitutional amendment, improperly opened ballots in private and illegally destroyed ballots from Wasserman Schultz\u2019s 2016 congressional race. Broward is almost invariably the last of Florida\u2019s 67 counties to report its election results, and the Florida secretary of state actually stationed monitors in Broward on Tuesday to look out for sketchy activity.\n\nThey didn\u2019t find any. So far, the department\u2019s most egregious foul-up in this election hurt the Democrats; a shoddy ballot design that tucked the Florida Senate race beneath the Creole-language instructions may explain why so many Broward voters\u2014almost 4 percent of them\u2014left that contest blank, perhaps reducing Democratic Senator Bill Nelson\u2019s margins in the county enough to swing his seat to Republican Governor Rick Scott. The blunder was reminiscent of the \u201cbutterfly ballot\u201d that may have cost Democrat Al Gore the 2000 presidential election in neighboring Palm Beach County, which earned a similar \u201cCorruption County\u201d reputation after a slew of indictments a decade ago, and is now frequently in the news as the home of Trump\u2019s \u201cwinter White House.\u201d\n\nBut even though there was no evidence that Snipes and her team engaged in nefarious partisan shenanigans in the midterms, there\u2019s mounting evidence that they\u2019re bad at running elections. Broward once again lagged the rest of Florida in reporting its results, and at key moments Snipes was unable to inform the public how many votes still remained to be counted. The county\u2019s usual cavalcade of missed deadlines and technical glitches has lent a veneer of plausibility to Republican conspiracy theories, even though a judge rejected Scott\u2019s efforts to impound Broward\u2019s voting machines, and Scott\u2019s own state police have said they\u2019ve received no credible allegations of impropriety. Trump keeps trying to discredit the recount and rile up his base by tweeting innuendo about an insidious \u201cBroward Effect\u201d that fabricates votes for Democrats, but locally, there\u2019s a fairly broad consensus that the Broward elections department is merely inept and imperious.\n\nDavid Aronberg, the top prosecutor in Palm Beach County, recalls that when he tried to compile financial disclosures from write-in candidates in 12 counties that he suspected were part of a political scam, 11 of the election departments either had the information on their websites or gave it to him right away. Broward\u2019s department bounced him around voice mail hell for a week, then told him he had to pick up the two-page document in person and pay a 25-cent processing fee. Aronberg eventually persuaded a county bureaucrat to email the forms, but the incident gave him new insight into the department\u2019s reputation for incompetence.\n\n\u201cIt was the worst experience I\u2019ve had with any office around the state,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, this is the 21st century! Let\u2019s just say they\u2019re \u2026 inefficient.\u201d\n\nSnipes is unlikely to keep her job for long. If she doesn\u2019t quit under pressure, Governor Scott and the Republican Legislature are expected to oust her, and fed-up Democrats are not expected to fight to save her. But Sheriff Israel has kept his job even though he hailed his own \u201camazing leadership\u201d after his deputies waited passively outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High while Nikolas Cruz was gunning down its students. The status quo largely prevailed at the Broward schools as well, even though the board had canceled a pilot program to use metal detectors, and even though the administration had shuffled Cruz from school to school despite repeated examples of threatening behavior.\n\nOne obstacle to change may be the Democratic stranglehold on county government. Broward\u2019s dominant coalition of northeastern transplants, liberal Jews, African-Americans and a rising tide of Caribbean immigrants has insulated Democratic officers from having to worry about Republican challengers. Kartik Krishnaiyer, a former Democratic operative from Coral Springs who runs a progressive website called The Florida Squeeze, says that the sugar industry, the construction industry and other special interests often invest in local Democratic primaries rather than waste money in pre-determined general elections, knowing that the winners usually get to keep their jobs as long as they want them. And Democrats at the state and national level tend to tolerate the routine messiness of the county, because Broward is the bluest part of their base in a purple state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched the Democrats in Broward get very comfortable with power,\u201d Krishnaiyer says. \u201cThere\u2019s no accountability, because there\u2019s no competition.\u201d\n\nDemocrats always count on big margins throughout southeast Florida, but there are enough Cuban-American Republicans in Miami-Dade to the south and country-club Republicans in Palm Beach to the north to keep those counties less politically lopsided. The current mayor of Miami-Dade is a Republican, and while the county commission is officially nonpartisan, Republicans held a 7-6 majority there until a seat flipped in June. By contrast, Democrats outnumber Republicans on Broward\u2019s commission by 8-1\u2014and after Tuesday\u2019s results, the split will be 9-0.\n\nIn fairness, while Miami-Dade\u2019s elections have been running smoothly in recent years, its turbulent politics are not considered a national model, either. Some Broward Democrats argue that their problems are not so atypical for a large and underfunded urban county, especially one with 31 independent municipalities and no one in charge. Snipes herself made this case to the Herald before the election: \u201cI think the problems are blown out of proportion. Broward is nitpicked to the bone.\u201d Mitchell Berger, a prominent Fort Lauderdale attorney and Democratic donor, points out that tabulating ballots is a lot more logistically challenging in Broward than the rural counties that reported their results in a timelier manner. And Berger believes a mayor who didn\u2019t rotate out every year and wasn\u2019t a mere functionary might be able to rein in some of the county\u2019s wayward departments.\n\n\u201cThe structure makes it really troublesome to govern,\u201d Berger says. \u201cI mean, we could never compete to bring in an Amazon\u2014who would they even talk to?\u201d\n\nA lot of Broward residents see the periodic scandals and outrages and CNN footage of activists screaming to lock someone up as unfortunate distractions that needlessly damage the reputation of a nice place to live and raise a family. Broward has America\u2019s largest single-story outlet mall, America\u2019s only internationally sanctioned cricket stadium and the world\u2019s largest annual boat show. Money magazine recently ranked the bedroom community of Weston the 21st-best place to live in America, and Mayor Dan Stermer believes it could be a national model\u2014for diversity, with its vibrant Venezuelan and Colombian communities; for prosperity, with projected 6 percent annual job growth over the next five years; and even for limited government, with only 10 full-time city employees for 68,000 residents. But those kind of details get overshadowed by indictments and cable-news trucks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d says Stermer, a part-time mayor whose day job is management consulting. \u201cHere in Weston we have a lot of businesspeople who just want to see things done right. Obviously in Broward that doesn\u2019t always happen.\u201d\n\nIn a way, Broward County\u2019s scandals and failures uphold its namesake\u2019s legacy. Governor Broward was a riverboat captain who made his name smuggling guns and explosives to Cuban rebels before the Spanish-American War, then got elected on a single-minded pledge to drain the Everglades. His drainage project was an utter failure, giving rise to enduring jokes about selling swampland in Florida, though he did make a lot of money from sketchy side deals with the men selling that swampland. Decades after his death, the federal government finally achieved his vision of draining the eastern Everglades, so Broward County now has Sawgrass Expressway in former sawgrass marshes, and the Florida Panthers ice-hockey arena in a former panther habitat. It also has a political swamp that gets periodically drained by federal investigators, but occasionally surfaces on national TV.\n\nBrad Meltzer, a best-selling author who writes thrillers at home in Hollywood, says modern Broward is home to a unique genre of crazy, the kind of crazy that, unlike conspicuous-consumption Palm Beach or narcissistic-showoff Miami-Dade, prefers to keep its crazy private. But every now and then, the crazy bursts into the open. The tragedy in Parkland was one of those moments, exposing some of the rot in Broward\u2019s sheriff\u2019s office and schools. The recount is becoming another moment, introducing Broward\u2019s klutzy election division to the nation. The two stories even collided this week when it came out that Cruz, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas gunman, registered to vote while awaiting trial in the Broward County Jail.\n\nHe registered as a Republican.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a fiction writer, but my editor would never let me get away with this stuff,\u201d Meltzer says. \u201cShe\u2019d say: \u2018Come on. Crazy is OK, but this is too crazy.\u2019\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this piece misspelled Richard DeNapoli\u2019s surname.\n\nMichael Grunwald is a senior staff writer for Politico Magazine.\n\nThis article tagged under: Florida", "Judge Karen Gievers wrote in a ruling she handed down Tuesday afternoon that Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher has eight aging recount machines that can only manage one race at a time. | Alan Diaz/AP Photo State moves recount case to federal court after state judge extends deadline\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 A ruling by Leon County Circuit Court judge extending the recount deadline by five days has been halted by a last minute move by the state that has placed the case in federal court.\n\nJudge Karen Gievers wrote in a ruling she handed down Tuesday afternoon the office of Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher was not equipped to recount three statewide races for U.S. Senate, governor and agriculture commissioner and a local state House seat by Thursday.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGievers ruled from the bench during a 1 p.m. status conference that Secretary of State Ken Detzner must give Bucher until Nov. 20 to complete the recount. An hour and a half later, lawyers for Detzner filed a notice of removal to Tallahassee federal court.\n\nThe case is one of the latest flareups in the ongoing fight over the three statewide races. The suit was filed Monday by Democrat Jim Bonfiglio, who is separated by 37 votes against Republican Mike Caruso for a state House district in southern Palm Beach County. The campaign for Democrat U.S. Sen Bill Nelson and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee filed motions to intervene in the case Tuesday morning.\n\nTuesday night, Nelson campaign lawyer Marc Elias told reporters he would rather see the case in federal court because the impact of the potential ruling would be statewide.\n\n\"That case will now wind its way to federal court and it will either play out there or find its way back to state court,\" Elias said.\n\nDetzner and his lawyers could not be reached for comment.\n\nIn her ruling, Gievers said Bucher's office is equipped with eight aging recount machines that can only manage one race at a time. The recount started Nov. 10 and the U.S. Senate race between Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott would likely be completed Tuesday.

The White House considered her most seriously for a position heading the Office of National Drug Control Policy. But the appointment did not work out, one former official involved in the process said, in part because of her set of \u201cdiva\u201d demands for taking the position, including reporting directly to the president.\n\nThroughout the early days of the transition and administration, Bondi pointedly refused to talk about her discussions with the administration, although she told some close associates she wasn\u2019t interested in a job that would be a step down from her current role as the elected chief legal officer of the nation\u2019s third most populous state.\n\nBut with a major cabinet shuffle underway \u2014 Trump is looking for replacements for both his attorney general and his Homeland Security secretary \u2014 Bondi\u2019s name is being talked about again.\n\n\u201cHe trusts her,\u201d said Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser who lives in Florida. \u201cThey\u2019ve always had an excellent personal rapport. She\u2019s got a good TV presence; she\u2019s very telegenic and that\u2019s important to the president.\u201d\n\nAs Trump works the phones with Bondi, the White House has also dispatched the president\u2019s favorite Florida congressman, Matt Gaetz, to Broward County, where he\u2019s taken on the role of the Republican face of the recount effort. Gaetz was planning to be in Tallahassee heading up the gubernatorial transition team for DeSantis. But the president wanted Gaetz in South Florida. So he went.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in regular contact with the White House, the president and the president\u2019s campaign about elections integrity issues in Florida,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cI don\u2019t know about Bondi, but I know the president really likes her.\u201d\n\nThe chances of Bondi\u2019s being appointed U.S. attorney general, people familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking said, remain slim, in part because of the many detractors she has in the personnel department and throughout the White House. But Bondi remains a friend of the president\u2019s who is viewed as loyal, and her role in the recount is helping her.\n\n\u201cIf Trump could snap his fingers, she would be attorney general tomorrow,\u201d said a source familiar with the president\u2019s thinking and his admiration for Bondi.\n\nIn the Florida Senate race, Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, is trying to beat incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. He currently leads by 12,562 votes, a margin small enough to automatically trigger a recount in the state. The outcome of the Florida Senate race is critical for Republicans, who want to expand their Senate majority to 53 seats.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, where Democrat Andrew Gillum conceded to Rep. Rick DeSantis on election night, the margin has shrunk to the point that Gillum rescinded his concession.\n\nBondi\u2019s decision to criticize the Florida Department of Law Enforcement \u2014 her state\u2019s version of the FBI \u2014 is being viewed by critics as something of a job audition for leading the Justice Department. Bondi earlier this week criticized the FDLE for not pursuing an investigation into alleged voting irregularities in Broward and Palm Beach counties. There has been no proof that any voter fraud exists.\n\nBut her move has helped to encourage Trump\u2019s view that the election results are tainted, even though no evidence exists to back that up.\n\n\u201cThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,\u201d Trump tweeted on Monday, referring to the Republican candidates for Senate and governor. \u201cAn honest vote count is no longer possible \u2014 ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\u201d\n\nBondi\u2019s name has also been floated as a potential replacement for Kirstjen Nielsen, the Department of Homeland Security secretary, who The Washington Post reported on Monday is expected to be fired within weeks, although she is not currently seen as a frontrunner for that position.\n\nBut even her detractors admit she has attributes that Trump values: She\u2019s proved her loyalty to him and doesn\u2019t leak; she\u2019s a woman at a time when the makeup of his cabinet could use one more; and she\u2019s polished and popular on his favorite television outlet, Fox News.\n\nBondi, who is also close with Fox News host Sean Hannity, has been such a frequent guest on the president\u2019s go-to network that she even co-hosted \u201cThe Five\u201d show in August for three days while serving as state attorney general.\n\nIn 2014, during her re-election campaign for that office, Trump\u2019s charity improperly made a $25,000 donation to her political committee. She subsequently refused to join a New York state civil fraud case against Trump University, opening up her and Trump to accusations of a \u201cpay to play\u201d arrangement. Bondi said at the time that she was unaware of the Trump University scandal when she solicited the contribution from Trump.\n\nBut the decision not to pursue the investigation initially was made by her predecessor and, Bondi\u2019s advisers told The Associated Press , she was unaware of New York case when she solicited the contribution from Trump. And, according to The New York Times , the check in question was cut four days before an Orlando Sentinel reporter inquired about the Trump University case from New York, bringing the matter for the first time to the attention of Bondi\u2019s office \u2014 but not Bondi \u2014 her staff told POLITICO.\n\nThough no ethics or legal violations were found, the Trump University controversy was initially cited as a major factor conspiring against a high-level appointment for Bondi by Trump. But now that the GOP majority is about to grow in the U.S. Senate and Florida is likely to have both Republican senators \u2014 assuming Scott holds on to his lead in the state\u2019s ongoing recount \u2014 the chances of an appointment grow.\n\nThe optics of the Trump University controversy, however, have stuck.\n\n\u201cIs it normal that the person that he paid off not to investigate his charity is now feeding him fake information about a recount that she\u2019s involved in in Florida?\u201d said Ron Klain, who served as chief of staff to Attorney General Janet Reno during the Clinton administration. \u201cThese partisan officials should stay out of the recount and let the process run its course appropriately.\u201d\n\nHer involvement in both could be bad news for a confirmation if the Republican majority in the Senate doesn\u2019t grow, even though no ethics or legal violations were ever filed against her.\n\n\u201cIf we have 53 Republican senators, the chances of confirmation go way up,\u201d said one insider close to the president. \u201cIf it\u2019s 51, the chances are lower.\u201d", "The legislation is being spearheaded in the Senate by Sen.

Acosta couldn\u2019t have done anything about it. Instead, Sanders and Trump regularly called on Acosta, counting on the likelihood that he would do that Acosta thing of speechifying and playing microphone hog as he attempts to turn a question into an extended back-and-forth. Sanders and Trump have pretended exasperation at Acosta\u2019s posturing\u2014posturing that hasn\u2019t broken much news, by the way\u2014but not so secretly they happily wallow in his pomposity. By getting Acosta to play the preening, self-aggrandizing, sanctimonious reporter and using him as the punching bag for the White House\u2019s anti-press strategy, Sanders and Trump have created a unique public venue to exhibit their hatred for the \u201cfake news\u201d of CNN.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe TV moments created by Acosta's clashes\u2014see the Guardian's reel of their best sparring matches\u2014have served him, too. If you\u2019re a fan of reporters who are better at lecturing than asking a question and think White House briefings and presidential press conferences should resemble the bloodsport of duels, then you probably find the Acosta clashes sufficiently enriching to make CNN your cable news destination.\n\nAcosta\u2019s forced exile and the lawsuit filed by CNN today demanding that Sanders and Trump return the \u201chard pass\u201d that will allow him to roam the White House grounds have turned him into a free speech martyr, which I suppose he is. Like all First Amendment radicals, I deplore the Acosta ban and look forward to the day that he\u2019s back in the White House making a pest of himself again. The case law cited in the suit by lawyer Theodore J. Boutrous, a top cock in the First Amendment bar\u2019s pecking order, appears to prevent the White House from arbitrarily banning reporters from White House press facilities \u201cfor less than compelling reasons.\u201d Even Fox News Channel\u2019s legal analyst Andrew Napolitano predicts that the matter will be resolved \u201cquickly\u201c in CNN\u2019s favor.\n\nThe original charge Sanders made when barring Acosta\u2014that he had placed \u201chis hands\u201d on the White House intern trying to retrieve his microphone during the presser\u2014has been disproved. Today, attempting to argue against the CNN suit, Sanders shifted her rationale for the de-Acostafication of the White House, accusing him additionally and accurately for not surrendering the microphone when approached by the intern.\n\nBut as Sanders herself acknowledges, this was not the first time Acosta had resisted yielding the floor. So where is the common justice in ejecting him from White House grounds without so much as a warning? Sanders and Trump have thrilled in Acosta\u2019s bad manners not only because his acting out helped personify their critique of CNN but also because it has made great TV drama for the president. Anything that\u2019s good for ratings is good with Trump. It\u2019s obvious from viewing the Acosta-Trump faceoff that Trump was spoiling for a fight\u2014\u201cHere we go,\u201d Trump interrupted as Acosta began the wind-up on his first question\u2014and started swinging back from the get-go. He wanted what Acosta was bringing so he could re-assume his old reality-TV role as the heavy who banishes the pretentious upstart. When the CNN lawsuit rolled in today, Trump must have clicked his heels in joy at the prospect of kicking Acosta and CNN around some more.\n\nTelevised White House briefings have always been political theater but under Trump\u2019s management they\u2019ve generated as much genuine news as a low-wattage kitchen microwave. The endless bickering between Sanders and the press corps and her obfuscations have become the story, much to the detriment of journalism. I wouldn\u2019t go so far to call the briefings useless\u2014they can connect reporters to otherwise hard-to-find facts and get the administration on the record\u2014but for real news you have to rely on reporters like Maggie Haberman who spend little time in the daily briefings waiting for news to arrive.\n\nLike so many episodes of The Trump Show, the martyrdom of Jim Acosta provides an entertaining sideshow. While it\u2019s true that he\u2019s more of a pain in the neck than a true newshawk, we can still call for his return to the White House briefing room in good conscience because being a pain in the neck is often a necessary part of the job.

He has the support of at least two-thirds of the incoming Democratic Caucus, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is up against a faction of Democrats trying to deprive her of the 218 votes she needs to reclaim the speaker\u2019s gavel. And Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn (D-S.C.) is facing a challenge from Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) for majority whip, although Clyburn is favored to win.\n\nBut Hoyer, who only needs to win a majority of the caucus to become majority leader, is already set, with more than two weeks to spare before House Democrats hold their Nov. 28 leadership elections.\n\n\u201cIn the majority, we will have considerable opportunity to effect change and great responsibility to get things done on behalf of our constituents. We will need a steady, experienced leader over the next two years, who also works to empower our members and prepare them for future leadership opportunities,\u201d more than 150 incumbents and members-elect wrote Tuesday in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Hoyer \u201cis an honest broker\u201d who \u201cis trusted by everyone in our Caucus,\u201d they said, and \u201cSteny also has a clear vision for the agenda House Democrats should pursue.\u201d\n\n\u201cImportantly, Steny will effectively go toe-to-toe with President Trump, advocating for our positions and ensuring vigorous oversight of this administration,\u201d they conclude. \u201cSteny is an innovative leader with unwavering integrity who empowers members and gets things done.

Chris Christie\u2019s use of the agreements caused the Department of Justice to issue new guidelines in 2008. | Getty Hearing for former Christie official could be a sign of things to come\n\nA hearing Tuesday for a federal appeals court nominee who used to work for former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie turned into a lengthy review of the scandals that plagued Christie\u2019s time in public office, both as U.S. Attorney and as New Jersey governor.\n\nThe one-hour, 20-minute hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee focused far more on Christie than on the nominee, Paul Matey. And that could be a sign of a far more contentious hearing if President Donald Trump nominates Christie to be the next attorney general. Christie is reportedly under serious consideration for the job in the wake of Jeff Sessions\u2019 forced resignation.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMatey, who served as deputy chief counsel in the Christie administration from 2010 to 2015, and before that was an assistant U.S. Attorney when Christie occupied that office, was nominated in April to serve on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. Neither of New Jersey\u2019s two Democratic senators, Cory Booker and Bob Menendez, have signed off on the nomination. The American Bar Association hasn\u2019t weighed in either.\n\nThe questions Matey faced Tuesday focused not only on the Bridgegate scandal \u2014 in which access lanes to the George Washington Bridge were shut down in order to tie up traffic in Fort Lee \u2014 but on everything from Christie\u2019s assigning of lucrative federal monitoring contracts to his political allies when he was U.S. Attorney to his use of a state helicopter while governor to attend his son\u2019s baseball game.\n\nMany of the scandals were covered extensively in the New Jersey press, but not by the national media, even after Christie launched his unsuccessful bid for president.\n\nMatey played a direct role in firing convicted Bridgegate conspirator Bridget Anne Kelly, telling her she was out of a job shortly after a notorious email surfaced in which she told co-conspirator David Wildstein that it was \u201ctime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\u201d\n\nHe also authorized Christie administration officials to reach out and seek endorsements from New Jersey mayors as long as it was not technically during work hours (the Democratic Fort Lee mayor\u2019s refusal to endorse Christie spurred the retaliation that became the Bridgegate scandal).\n\n\u201cMr. Matey, the Christie administration was plagued by scandals while you served as the governor\u2019s chief ethics officer and deputy chief counsel,\u201d Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said. \u201cGiven that criminal conduct was taking place at the highest level of the Christie administration, do you believe you provided significant legal advice?\u201d\n\nMatey said \u201cit\u2019s important to make clear for the record that I had no knowledge, involvement or participation in any of those events,\u201d adding that the Bridgegate scandal was \u201cthe unfortunate act of several individuals who decided to take matters outside of the law and into their own hands.\u201d\n\nThree officials were charged and convicted in the Bridgegate probe \u2014 two after trial and one after pleading guilty \u2014 but several witnesses testified that Christie had more knowledge of the lane closures than he had let on.\n\nLeahy also brought up a multi-million dollar state-funded television ad Christie ran in the lead-up to his reelection. The ad highlighted Superstorm Sandy recovery and featured the governor and his family prominently.\n\nIn addition, Leahy cited Christie\u2019s decision to strip state Sen. Dick Codey (D-Essex), a former Senate president and governor, of his security detail, and his administration\u2019s quashing of an indictment against a political ally, which ultimately led to the state paying a $1.5 million whistleblower settlement without acknowledging any wrongdoing.\n\nAnd there was the time, Leahy noted, that the governor took a state police helicopter to his son\u2019s baseball game. Christie later reimbursed the state for the flight despite initially refusing to do so.\n\nMatey repeatedly said he did not recall advising Christie on most of the issues that became scandals.\n\n\u201cMy job, generally, senator, was to provide guidance on all matters of legislation and legal inquiries that might come,\u201d Matey said in response to Leahy\u2019s questions. \u201cIt was a large office that dealt with a number of matters that were routinely coming before the governor. \u2026 There were probably hundreds of matters on which I consulted.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may want to search your memory,\u201d Leahy shot back.\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) questioned Matey about Christie\u2018s decision to line-item veto funding for programs connected to the late professor Alan Rosenthal who, as a tiebreaker in New Jersey\u2019s state legislative redistricting process, voted to approve the map drawn by Democrats.\n\nWhile Matey said he had nothing to do with the funding veto, he acknowledged playing a role in the governor\u2019s decision to award a $150 million no-bid contract for Sandy cleanup to the company Ashbritt, which days later donated $50,000 to the Republican Governors Association. But Matey said he couldn\u2019t talk about that because it \u201ctreads upon an area of attorney-client privilege.\u201d\n\nMatey also said he didn\u2019t recall having anything to do with New Jersey\u2019s decision in 2011 to settle a $30 million tax debt from Trump\u2019s Atlantic City casinos for $5 million. And, he said, as an assistant U.S. Attorney under Christie, he didn\u2019t consult Christie on the controversial practice of allowing companies to enter into agreements under which they hired monitors to avoid prosecution. Christie\u2019s office chose those monitors, on several occasions rewarding lucrative contracts to his friends and former allies. In one of those cases, the pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers Squibb as part of its agreement endowed a professorship at Seton Hall Law School \u2014 the alma mater of both Christie and Matey.\n\nThe controversy over Christie\u2019s use of the agreements caused the Department of Justice to issue new guidelines in 2008.\n\n\u201cIf you had known about this, would you have advised as assistant U.S. Attorney, the U.S. Attorney, Mr. Christie, not to engage in this kind of settlement?\u201d Hirono asked. \u201cBecause the obvious quid pro quo is so clear.\u201d\n\nMatey demurred, saying that as an assistant U.S. Attorney, he was sure \u201calways to follow the law faithfully as given by this Congress.\u201d\n\nBooker, who has a historically friendly relationship with Christie, did not follow Leahy and Hirono in rehashing Christie\u2019s scandals. Instead, he focused on Matey\u2019s post-Christie work as general counsel and secretary of University Hospital in Newark.\n\nBooker, the former mayor of Newark and New Jersey\u2019s junior senator, noted that safety conditions at the state-run hospital deteriorated during Matey\u2019s time there.\n\n\u201cPatient service really nosedived during the time you were there,\u201d Booker said.\n\nMatey, who recently left the hospital job and is now a partner at the firm Lowenstein Sandler, said he and other hospital administrators were concerned about the nonprofit organizations that had downgraded the hospital\u2019s safety rating and took steps to correct it.\n\nBooker and other senators also needled Matey on his lack of pro bono work. Matey said most of his work has been in public service, but that he\u2019s engaged in work that benefits society, like launching University Hospital\u2019s reentry program to employ ex-offenders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been privileged to spend the vast majority, nearly the entirety of my career, working on behalf of public entities and in the cause of the public,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of those positions have constrained my ability to take on outside clients, but I have been honored at the work that I\u2019ve been able to do to improve, i believe, the conditions of justice in our state as well as the lives of individuals that I\u2019ve touched.\u201c", "Thomas Homan was tapped in November 2017 to lead ICE permanently but instead chose to retire in June of this year, citing the need to spend more time with his family. | Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images White House Trump considers tough-talking former ICE director for DHS chief Trump likes Thomas Homan's frequent and often fiery appearances on cable news defending the White House's immigration policies.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is considering Thomas Homan, former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to succeed Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, three people familiar with the process told POLITICO.\n\nHoman\u2019s name has surfaced amid a flurry of media reports that Nielsen could be asked to resign before the end of the month.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTapping Homan to run the Department of Homeland Security would almost certainly energize Trump\u2019s base. The tough-talking lawman once recommended charging so-called sanctuary city politicians \u201cwith crimes\u201d and has pugnaciously defended even Trump\u2019s most controversial immigration moves, including separating children from their parents at the border.\n\n\u201cTrump wants John Wayne on the border, and Tom Homan is John Wayne,\u201d said a former Homeland Security official, who cited Homan\u2019s frequent and often fiery appearances on cable news as a part of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that Trump would especially like.\n\nHoman joins a list of possible new DHS chiefs that has been growing in recent days as rumors swirled that Nielsen is on her way out. According to a senior White House official, the president has been itching to fire Nielsen for months over what he views as weak leadership on border security, along with other enforcement policies that he has sought to implement. Going forward, Trump has told aides he wants an agency chief who will fervently defend his hard-line approach to illegal immigration, particularly with an incoming House Democratic majority that has promised to thwart his agenda at every turn.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

However, the same senior White House official confirmed that discussions about her job status have taken place.\n\nIn addition to Homan, other potential Nielsen replacements include Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and David Pekoske, administrator of the Transportation Security Administration. Both have already been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThe president is also considering Maj. Gen. Vincent Coglianese, who currently runs the Marine Corps Installations Command, according to two people familiar with the process. One of Coglianese\u2019s sons serves as editorial director at the Daily Caller, a conservative outlet known for its favorable news coverage of the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s literally perfect for the gig,\u201d said a source familiar with the president\u2019s search. This person described Coglianese as ideologically aligned with the White House \u201cbut basically nonpolitical.\u201d\n\nHowever, because Coglianese remains on active duty, nominating him would introduce certain challenges to the confirmation process for such a role.\n\nTapping Homan would send a strong law-and-order signal. An ex-cop who later became a Border Patrol agent and rose to a senior-level role during the Obama administration, Homan was named acting director of ICE shortly after Trump took office.\n\nAs the top official at the law enforcement agency, Homan was responsible for implementing some of the president\u2019s most contentious immigration policies, including increasing the number of arrests of people living in the U.S. illegally and battling local jurisdictions that refused to cooperate with federal immigration agents.\n\nWhile that background has endeared Homan to Trump, it would also make for a brutal Senate confirmation fight.\n\n\u201cTom couldn\u2019t get confirmed to be dogcatcher,\u201d a former DHS official told POLITICO, adding that Senate Democrats could \u201cpeel off a couple moderates and ice him\u201d in the confirmation process.\n\nOne former DHS official who worked in the Obama administration called Homan \u201ca good man and a patriot\u201d but claimed he \u201clacks the necessary nuances of leadership\u201d to sit at the agency\u2019s helm and \u201cwould never push back on the White House.\u201d\n\nBeyond the possibility of less-than-unanimous Republican support, any senator could place a hold on Homan\u2019s nomination, preventing a vote from reaching the Senate floor.\n\nHoman\u2019s role as an unapologetic mouthpiece for the administration, even after he retired from ICE, could also complicate a confirmation process.\n\nIn a heated exchange with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer this summer, Homan defended the administration\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 a practice that drew bipartisan condemnation.\n\n\u201cI think it is the law,\u201d Homan told the network. \u201cThe parents are making a choice. They\u2019re choosing, they are taking it upon themselves to enter illegally and have the children taken away. So if anybody is to blame here, it is the parents who made a decision to break the law.\u201d\n\nHoman has appeared on Fox News several times as a contributor since retiring from ICE, including last month, when he applauded Trump for threatening to deploy thousands of U.S. troops to the border to assist Border Patrol agents preparing for the arrival of the migrant caravan.\n\n\u201cI think the president threw down the gauntlet, as he should have,\u201d Homan said in an Oct. 18 appearance.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear whether Homan would be open to the position, an ICE official said Tuesday.\n\nHoman was tapped in November 2017 to lead ICE permanently but instead chose to retire in June of this year, citing the need to spend more time with his family. The ICE official confirmed that family commitments might preclude Homan from keeping his hat in the ring for DHS chief.\n\nIf Trump fires Nielsen, or if she resigns \u2014 something she has yet to offer to do, according to one DHS official \u2014 the next official in the DHS chain of succession is Claire Grady, the Senate-confirmed undersecretary for management. Grady is serving as the agency\u2019s acting No. 2 official because the White House has yet to nominate someone to fill that spot.\n\nGrady, who previously managed procurement and acquisitions at the Defense Department, is considered an exceptional manager but not overtly political, according to former colleagues.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a career, you\u2019re executing policy, some you personally believe in and some you don\u2019t personally believe in,\u201d said a former DHS official. \u201cThat\u2019s different than being someone who stands out there on the news and says, \u2018I believe this is the right thing.\u2019\u201d\n\nCurrent and former DHS officials have marveled at the lack of urgency to tap a deputy at the department, which oversees a vast portfolio of national security issues.\n\nOne former official called it \u201cmalfeasance,\u201d while a current administration official said the departure of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, combined with Nielsen\u2019s expected exit, would create a major \u201cleadership vacuum \u2026 at two of the agencies that have the most equities in border security and immigration enforcement.\"\n\nAnnie Karni and Daniel Lippman contributed to this report.", "Melania Trump's office said in a statement that Mira Ricardel \"no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.\" | Benoit Tessier/AFP/Getty Images White House Melania Trump calls for the ouster of John Bolton's top aide\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump is openly calling for the ouster of one of the top officials on the National Security Council \u2014 a rare public rebuke that comes as the president weighs a broader shake-up of the West Wing after last week's midterm elections.\n\nMelania Trump's office said in a blunt statement on Tuesday that Mira Ricardel, the deputy to national security adviser John Bolton, does not belong in the White House anymore.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\u201d Stephanie Grisham, the first lady\u2019s spokesperson, said of Ricardel in the statement.\n\nWhile the statement didn't elaborate, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that President Donald Trump has decided to fire Ricardel at Melania's urging after clashes regarding the first lady's recent solo trip to Africa.\n\nStaff in the East Wing tussled with Ricadel \u201cover seating on the plane and requests to use National Security Council resources\u201d on the Africa trip, and some on the first lady\u2019s staff have suspected Ricardel is to blame for some negative stories about Melania Trump, according to the Journal report.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Ricardel, along with Bolton, also has \"a very closed style. It\u2019s literally closed-door as opposed to open-door,\" as it was under former national security adviser H.R. McMaster, said a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe NSC's atmosphere currently is \"much more close-hold, much more skeptical of the staff who works for them in some ways,\" the person said.\n\nAsked whether NSC staffers liked working for Bolton and Ricardel, the source said: \"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of warm and fuzzy stuff going on. ...

The officials both cited Ayers\u2019 work on Pence\u2019s midterm campaigning strategy, which they said impressed Trump.\n\nIn recent months, Ayers has traveled with Trump at least twice without Pence present, according to a senior White House official. One of those trips was an October swing to Florida and Ayers\u2019 native Georgia to survey hurricane damage.\n\nTrump and Ayers had already discussed the chief of staff job in the early summer, according to a former senior administration official, but at the time it was unclear when Kelly would depart. And Trump spent the summer asking friends, White House advisers and former aides: \u201cWhat do we think about Nick?\u201d \u2014 a tic he often employs when he is privately considering a staff shake-up.\n\nAyers first impressed Ivanka Trump, Kushner and then-Trump campaign chairman Steve Bannon as an aide to Pence during the presidential campaign. All three later encouraged Ayers to join the White House as a replacement for Pence\u2019s first chief of staff, Josh Pitcock. If Ayers took over as chief of staff, he would be seen by some Trump allies as an upgrade over Kelly, since he has far greater political chops.\n\nAt the White House\u2019s election night gathering last week, Kelly steered clear of the president and his family. Ayers, meanwhile, was seen huddling with the president. The pair discussed the chief of staff job, according to a person briefed on the night\u2019s events. Ayers did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.\n\nWith a fast-moving and fickle president, few things are certain, and Ayers\u2019 ascension to the post remains far from a sure thing. Ayers, who has three young children, has weighed returning to the private sector in Georgia, where he\u2019s held onto his house. There have also been discussions about moving him to Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s chaotic West Wing, the chief of staff position is seen as a less desirable post than it has been in previous administrations.\n\nAnd Ayers, perceived as presumptuous and overly ambitious by some in Washington, has alienated several influential White House advisers.\n\n\u201cThe knives aren\u2019t out for Nick \u2014 the machetes are,\u201d said one Trump ally.

Rick Scott, who is running for U.S. Senate, has vocally pushed the idea that Democrats are engaging in fraud to \u201csteal\u201d the election for his opponent, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who trails Scott by roughly 12,000 votes. That push has been amplified by President Donald Trump, who has tweeted several times \u2014 most recently Tuesday \u2014 about what he sees is voter fraud. Though a host of Republicans, including Scott and Trump, have cried voter fraud, there has so far been no evidence it has occurred.\n\nThat fraud push received some resistance after both Scott\u2019s own election officials and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said there were no fraud allegations.\n\nBondi gave some cover Sunday night, when she sent a letter chastising FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen for not more aggressively investigating voter fraud. During a political event last Thursday, Scott \u2014 in his role as Senate candidate \u2014 asked FDLE to investigate Palm Beach and Broward counties, which Republicans have suggested are hot beds for potential voter fraud. Both counties have predominantly Democratic voters.\n\nSwearingen said his department was not investigating voter fraud allegations because state election officials, which are part of Scott\u2019s administration, said there were none to investigate. That, though, was not good enough for Bondi.\n\n\u201cCommissioner, protesters continue to grow around the state as well as additional complaints of election impropriety,\u201d Bondi wrote to Swearingen then. \u201cYour duty to investigate this matter is clear. I am directing you to take the necessary steps to promote public safety and to assure that our state will guarantee integrity in our election process.\u201d\n\nSwearingen shot back Tuesday, slamming Bondi for the implication that his office would not investigate voter fraud.\n\n\u201cI am deeply troubled that you think I have announced that FDLE would not be pursuing any investigation or inquiry into the conduct of elections officials in Broward or Palm Beach counties (or any other county) that may rise to criminal conduct during the 2018 election,\u201d Swearingen wrote in the letter, which was first reported by the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nHe noted that he said he would work with the Florida Department of State, which oversees elections, to monitor potential fraud moving forward. FDLE is a Florida Cabinet-level agency, which means it is overseen by Scott and three-person cabinet, which includes Bondi.\n\nSwearingen\u2019s letter also noted that FDLE has \u201calready taken the necessary steps to promote public safety and specifically the integrity of our election process during the midterm 2018 election,\u201d but did not elaborate in the letter on what those steps were.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger said there was no \u201cadditional information to provide at this time,\u201d when asked Sunday about what the letter was referencing.\n\nThe current recount efforts include not only the Senate race, but the Florida governor\u2019s race and agriculture commissioner race, which is a statewide elected post.

Bill Nelson\u2019s campaign filed a new last-minute lawsuit Tuesday targeting Florida rules that govern how elections officials divine voter intent on problematic disputed ballots.\n\nThe federal lawsuit, filed in Tallahassee, takes aim at two specific standards \u2014 one called the \u201cmagic words\" requirement and the other called the \u201cconsistency\" requirement \u2014 and says they violate First Amendment free speech rights and 14th Amendment equality protections.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe complaint is one of a number of recent lawsuits filed by Nelson, a Democrat who trails Republican Gov. Rick Scott by less than a quarter-percentage point. The margin is close enough to trigger a manual recount of tens of thousands of disputed ballots that could be ordered Thursday at the end of the ongoing machine recount. A machine recount is triggered when races have margins of less than a half-percent.\n\nIn a manual recount, the 67 county canvassing boards are required to review all ballots where no votes (called undervotes) or too many votes (overvotes) are cast by each voter. The officials then must make a determination concerning voter intent.\n\nBut, Nelson\u2019s suit says the rules passed by the Florida Department of State unconstitutionally disenfranchise voters and aren\u2019t consistent or fair.\n\nFor instance, voters who mistakenly circle their choice of candidate but then bubble in their choices in other races won\u2019t have their vote counted. But voters who mistakenly circle their candidate of choice and either don\u2019t vote in other races or fail to bubble-in their choice in those other races will have their votes counted.\n\nThe so-called \"consistency\" requirement unfairly disadvantages one class of voters over another, the suit says.\n\nAlso, though a voter may overvote and choose both Scott and Nelson but then put an X through one\u2019s name, the vote won\u2019t count. But if the voter writes \u201cmagic words\u201d such as \u201cnot this\u201d or \u201cignore\u201d next to a candidate\u2019s name, then their vote will count.\n\nThe \u201cMagic Words Requirement imposes different and severe burdens upon the right to vote for similarly situated qualified voters,\u201d the suit says. \u201cUnder the rule, two voters who have marked multiple candidates in the same contest and whose ballots contain a clear indication of their definite choice are treated differently solely based on whether they indicate their intent to cancel out their erroneous selection by writing certain \u2018magic words\u2019 on their ballot rather than by crossing out, striking through, or scribbling out the erroneous selection.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the suit says, Nelson would be disadvantaged by a rule that says the Division of Elections would help determine voters\u2019 choices in disputed cases, but \u201cthe process would provide no relief to voters in the November 2018 election since any such changes from these recommendations would occur after the manual recount for this election is already complete.\u201d", "Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley\u2019s decision on whether to keep or give up his gavel will have a big effect on several other senior senators \u2014 and potentially the appointment of the next attorney general. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images congress Grassley weighs leaving Judiciary Committee chairmanship\n\nChuck Grassley is still keeping his options open regarding which powerful committee he will helm next Congress, a decision that will have significant ramifications for his colleagues and for Congress as a whole.\n\nThe Iowa Republican is deliberating whether to stay as Judiciary Committee chairman for another two years or whether to pursue the Senate Finance Committee chairmanship, which is opening up with the retirement of current chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah).\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGrassley has long said he would make his decision immediately after the midterms, presumably to see who captured the majority.

Graham is up for reelection in 2020 and is angling for Trump's backing to help avoid a tough primary challenge.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee is a contentious and difficult committee to lead, but it may have more sway than the Finance Committee in the next divided Congress given the lack of ideological overlap between the incoming House Democratic majority and the Senate GOP majority on tax policy. Senate Republicans can confirm judicial nominees with no support from Democrats, which could make that job more influential in the coming months.\n\nIf Grassley stays at Judiciary, Sen.

Now, it\u2019s leading the effort to Trump-proof the law\u2019s insurance markets.\n\nWashington, along with progressive strongholds like California and New Jersey, have taken numerous steps to blunt the Trump administration\u2019s recent expansion of cheaper and slimmer coverage alternatives to Obamacare. The law\u2019s new enrollment period, which opened almost two weeks ago, could show just how much states supporting the Affordable Care Act can insulate themselves from President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to weaken it.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is working much better than everybody from Donald Trump through his administration is willing to acknowledge,\u201d said Mike Kreidler, Washington\u2019s insurance commissioner, during a recent interview at his office on the Capitol grounds. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a fully functioning, vibrant market here in the state of Washington.\u201d\n\nWhile the health care law\u2019s insurance markets are stabilizing across the country, they\u2019re still facing nagging problems not even the most Obamacare-friendly states can solve themselves. Years of premium hikes have made the coverage unaffordable for many middle-class customers who don\u2019t qualify for federal subsidies, and sky-high deductibles force some to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket each year before coverage kicks in.\n\nDemocrats took Obamacare repeal off the table by winning back the House last week, but the Trump administration has already left its stamp on the law\u2019s marketplaces. Through regulatory actions, it reversed Obama-era limits on short-term plans \u2014 which typically don\u2019t cover pre-existing conditions and some other Obamacare-mandated benefits like prescription drugs \u2014 and will allow people to renew the plans for up to three years. The administration is also encouraging more small businesses and individuals to band together in coverage outside of the law\u2019s marketplaces.\n\nPOLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe Trump administration says its policies will help provide cheaper insurance options, especially for those priced out of the Obamacare markets. Trump officials \u2014 and Republicans, generally \u2014 argue people should be able to buy less robust coverage if it suits their health care needs.\n\nObamacare supporters, however, worry that healthier customers will opt for cheaper coverage, leaving the law\u2019s exchanges with mostly sick patients. That could prompt insurers to hike rates further or stop selling Obamacare coverage.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s just ass backwards for what they\u2019re trying to accomplish,\u201d Kreidler said of the Trump administration.\n\nKreidler, the longest-serving Democratic insurance commissioner in the country, is at the vanguard of Washington state\u2019s efforts to thwart Trump\u2019s health care moves. He issued regulations last month strictly limiting the sale of short-term health policies to three months and wrote rules to boost insurer participation in the state\u2019s Obamacare marketplace. He backed a failed effort to approve a state-level individual mandate after the Republican-led Congress jettisoned the federal requirement, and he\u2019s pushing the state legislature to make another run at shoring up the market next year.\n\n\u201cWe are doing everything we can to protect ourselves,\u201d said state Rep. Eileen Cody, chair of the Health and Wellness Committee, who\u2019s supporting a still-undefined plan to create a public-run insurance plan next year\n\nLike Washington, other states have made aggressive moves to bolster their exchanges, New Jersey, Vermont and Washington, D.C. passed their own individual mandates this year. California banned short-term plans entirely, while several other states sharply limited their availability.\n\nWashington state\u2019s efforts to protect its insurance marketplace from Trump meddling haven\u2019t been without setbacks, though. The legislative proposal to enact an individual mandate went nowhere, largely because the state doesn\u2019t have an income tax, which is typically the enforcement mechanism used in states with a coverage requirement. Kreidler\u2019s proposal to create a reinsurance program providing financial support for insurers\u2019 most expensive customers stalled after unions balked at letting the state tax their health plans to help fund it.\n\nMarketplaces in many parts of the country are stabilizing this year \u2014 average premiums for a key benchmark plan are down slightly for 2019 and more insurers are selling coverage. HHS Secretary Alex Azar said the Trump administration deserves credit for the success, and federal health officials point to reinsurance programs they\u2019ve approved in several states and other regulations meant to stabilize the marketplaces.\n\nKreidler said the administration's claims don\u2019t square with reality.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe that somebody would have the audacity to make a claim like that for which they could take absolutely zero credit,\u201d he said.\n\nWashington state officials are eager to boast about their marketplace. The uninsured rate plummeted by 60 percent between 2013, when the exchange opened, and 2016. More than 500,000 low-income adults are in expanded Medicaid. Enrollment in the exchange, known as Washington Health Plan Finder, has grown every year, topping 200,000 in last year\u2019s sign-up period even amid uncertainty about the ACA\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re being attacked, you have all that energy,\u201d said exchange CEO Pam MacEwan of last year\u2019s enrollment efforts. \u201cWe just kind of plowed on through and it all came together.\u201d\n\nWith seven insurers selling coverage, Washington\u2019s exchange is among the most competitive in the country. The state took new steps to keep competition high after some parts of the state last year were briefly at risk of becoming \u201cbare counties\u201d where no insurers wanted to sell plans.\n\nKreidler issued regulations giving insurers more flexibility in how they price plans in different parts of the state, along with incentives for them to sell coverage in more counties. To guard against bare counties, the legislature also required insurers covering school district employees to also sell exchange plans if no other insurers are offering coverage in the area, starting in 2020.\n\nSelin Caka, a 41-year-old family therapist, felt confident enough to leave her job and start her own business last year because she knew she could buy exchange coverage. She's enrolled in a Kaiser Permanente plan that costs $88 per month after generous federal subsidies, thought it has a $6,500 deductible. Caka, who has a neurological disorder that requires ongoing medication, said she\u2019d prefer a plan with lower out-of-pocket costs but is otherwise happy with the coverage.\n\n\u201cIf I get hit by a bus, it\u2019s not going to bankrupt me,\u201d Caka said.\n\nStill, as with other exchanges around the country, there are signs of distress in Washington. Most notably, the number of people buying Obamacare plans without subsidies dropped this year by about 30,000, or nearly 10 percent of the state\u2019s individual market. The trend could accelerate this coming year, with rates in Washington jumping 13.8 percent on average for 2019 plans.\n\nHistorically, the rate hikes in Washington had been lower than in other states. State officials and insurers point out the big 2019 rate hike is largely driven by Kaiser, which had underpriced the market for 2018 plans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to get on top of rates once you get behind, because the commissioner\u2019s just not going to give you a 50 percent rate increase, an 80 percent rate increase,\u201d said Jim Havens, senior vice president for Premera Blue Cross, which is increasing rates by just 2 percent next year and sells in about a third of Washington counties. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a long road to get back ahead of that.\u201d\n\nHavens said the insurer is even more nervous about the current enrollment season than last year\u2019s, despite the state\u2019s aggressive moves to shore up the marketplace. With the individual mandate penalty gone, he\u2019s worried customers will drop ACA coverage or still opt for the skinnier plans.\n\n\u201cIt could be a slow bleed,\u201d Havens said. \u201cPeople that left may not come back and they may tell people who then leave and don\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced with the support of the Dennis A.

'He will think Bezos made this decision to stick it to him.'\n\nAmazon's move to establish a new headquarters in the Washington area will have one immediate political impact: putting CEO Jeff Bezos more in President Donald Trump's face than ever.\n\nBezos' ownership of The Washington Post, which he bought back in 2013, has enraged Trump, sparking Twitter-fueled allegations from the president that Amazon is dodging taxes, ripping off the U.S. Postal Service and putting traditional retailers out of business.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut the CEO's decision to put down corporate roots in the D.C. suburb of Crystal City, Va., injecting some 25,000 jobs into a region Trump has dubbed the \"The Swamp,\" threatens to stoke the president's resentment of the tech mogul.\n\n\u201cAnything that makes Bezos more prominent in Washington is going to irritate Trump and he will take it personally,\" said Michael D\u2019Antonio, author of the 2015 Trump biography \"Never Enough.\" D\u2019Antonio added: \"He will think Bezos made this decision to stick it to him.\u201d\n\nAmazon had initially been expected to choose one winner for its second headquarters, but on Tuesday, the company announced two: Crystal City and the Long Island City neighborhood in Queens, New York.\n\nQueens has significance for Trump as well. He grew up there before becoming a New York City real estate developer and reality TV host. But it's Washington \u2014 Trump's current home \u2014 where Amazon's growth plans could produce the most tension with the president.\n\nBezos, who was this year named the world's richest man, has been increasing his profile in the nation's capital, even as Trump has accelerated his attacks on the company.\n\nMorning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nJust days before Trump's inauguration, it emerged that Bezos was the anonymous buyer of D.C.'s biggest house, a 27,000-square-foot former textile museum. He's become a regular at some of Washington's premier social events, like the Alfalfa Club dinner. And the CEO and his wife, MacKenzie Bezos, recently entered the political donor class, giving $10 million to a super PAC that aims to elect military veterans to Congress.\n\nBut it's not just D.C.'s social and political circles that interest Bezos; there's a business calculus for establishing a bigger, flashier presence in the Washington area. The federal government represents a huge potential market for Amazon's cloud services business. And the e-commerce giant has a growing list of lobbying priorities in Washington, from delivery drones to online privacy to issues like taxes, trade and immigration.\n\n\u201cDo I think he's going to come in and say my role with headquarters two in Washington is to change Donald Trump? No. He's here to do business,\" said Bobbie Kilberg, the president of the Northern Virginia Technology Council, which counts Amazon Web Services as a member.\n\nBezos' decision to establish a headquarters in greater Washington, however, will cement his status as an immensely powerful player in D.C. \u2014 and an unavoidable presence for Trump.\n\nEven before the announcement, Amazon's interest in the D.C. area was credited with helping to break the longstanding logjam over funding for the region's ailing Metro system. Now, Amazon's pledge of thousands of new corporate jobs could be a stimulus for the local job market, at a time when the White House is seeking to cancel automatic pay raises for 1.8 million federal workers.\n\nBezos' flood-the-swamp plan comes amid growing Trump animus toward Amazon. The president equates the company with The Washington Post, which he considers part of the \"fake news\" media that cover him unfairly. He accuses Amazon of using The Post as a lobbyist to avoid taxes and says the company treats the U.S. Postal Service like its \"Delivery Boy.\"\n\nThe Amazon CEO spent months laying low as Trump ramped up his attacks, but at a dinner in Washington in September, he called the president's anti-media rhetoric bad for democracy.\n\n\"What the president should say is, 'This is right. This is good. I am glad I am getting scrutinized,'\" Bezos said at the event hosted by the Economic Club of Washington. \"But it's really dangerous to demonize the media. It's dangerous to call the media lowlifes. It's dangerous to say they're the 'enemy of the people.'\"\n\nIt's unclear how far Trump will take the feud, now that Amazon is coming to his backyard.\n\nIn April, the White House unveiled a task force to examine the budget woes of the financially troubled U.S. Postal Service, amid speculation that the president would use it to target Amazon with higher shipping rates. And Trump has repeatedly suggested that Amazon and other major tech companies are ripe for antitrust scrutiny.\n\nAmazon, though, is poised to expand its influence game in D.C. with the headquarters plan. The company is already one of the biggest tech industry spenders in Washington, shelling out $12.8 million for lobbying in 2017 and maintaining a stable of well-connected lobby firms. But having thousands more workers in the area will undoubtedly give it greater leverage in the capital and its many policy debates.\n\nBezos himself will likely be a more frequent visitor to the area. The Washingtonian magazine has already chronicled the CEO's emerging profile as a \"freewheeling DC socialite.\" The story, complete with an image of Bezos looming over the capital's skyline, raised the idea that he could fill a role once occupied by the late Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham, bringing prominent decision-makers and thinkers together for salon-like dinners.\n\n\"In an ecosystem where power matters more than money or fame, an invitation to the house of the richest man in the world says something,\" said Cathy Merrill Williams, the president and publisher of Washingtonian Media.\n\nTrump and Bezos mixed it up even before the 2016 election, when Trump accused Bezos of using The Washington Post as a tax-dodging \"scam,\" and the Amazon CEO responded cheekily that Trump had \"finally trashed\" him. Bezos also proposed to have his space flight company, Blue Origin, offer Trump a seat on one of its rockets in a tweet featuring the tongue-in-cheek hashtag #sendDonaldtospace.\n\nAfter Trump's victory, Bezos and other tech executives attended an awkward Trump Tower meeting as they made nice with a president-elect they had not supported during the campaign. Amazon later announced it would add 100,000 new \"full-time, full-benefit\" U.S. jobs, joining other companies in touting domestic growth plans to please the incoming president \u2014 and Trump's transition team promptly took credit for the pledge. Bezos later participated in the White House innovation office led by Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and attended a White House tech gathering last year.\n\nStill, Trump ramped up his Twitter attacks on Amazon. Just days after sitting near Bezos at the June 2017 summit, the president unleashed the first of many volleys at the company, apparently enraged by Washington Post coverage.\n\nUndaunted, Bezos has continued to pursue Amazon's agenda in Washington, hosting Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in Seattle and positioning the company as a top contender for a $10 billion Pentagon cloud services contract known as JEDI. Winning that contract would be a huge victory for the company, solidifying its position as the nation's leading web services provider.\n\nExpanding in Washington, however, could expose Bezos to other kinds of political risk, making him a more tempting target for the company's critics.\n\nThe CEO last month moved to defuse a source of growing liberal outrage about his company, announcing Amazon would increase the minimum wage it pays its thousands of warehouse workers to $15 per hour.\n\nThat appeared to be an effort to appease Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who spent months denouncing the working conditions at Amazon's network of \"fulfillment centers\" and asking why one of the world's most valuable companies couldn't treat its employees better. Sanders had even introduced a bill called the Stop BEZOS Act, which would require large companies like Amazon to compensate the government when their employees use federal assistance programs like food stamps.\n\nWhile Bezos sought to lower the temperature on that issue, the dust-up could be a sign of things to come for Amazon as questions accumulate about the company's business and labor practices and its dominance in the online retail market, which is drawing increasing attention among regulators.\n\n\"No one wants to be the brightest spot in the greater Washington area, because it's just a target and you don't want that target on your back,\" said Jim Dinegar, the longtime head of the Greater Washington Board of Trade. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the concerns that Amazon has got to have on their list.\"", "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is recovering from home after a fall in her office left her with three broken ribs. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP photo supreme court Ruth Bader Ginsburg to miss another day at court, recovering after fall\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will not be present for a session at the Supreme Court Tuesday but is recovering and working from home after a fall in her office left her with three broken ribs, a court spokeswoman said.\n\nGinsburg, 85, went to the hospital for observation and treatment after she experienced discomfort overnight following her fall Nov. 7.

Amazon also intends to apply for up to $1 billion in other incentives through New York City economic development programs.\n\nIn return, Amazon projects it will yield incremental tax revenue of more than $10 billion over the next 20 years.\n\n\"This is the largest economic development initiative that's ever been done by the state or the city or the city and state together,\u201d New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at an event Tuesday. \"For us, this is being part of the economy of tomorrow and Amazon is no doubt a big part of that space.\"\n\nIn Virginia, state and county officials agreed to $573 million in cash grants for Amazon that require the company to create 25,000 jobs with an average wage of more than $150,000. Virginia Tech will also build a $1 billion \"graduate Innovation Campus\" less than two miles from Amazon\u2019s new site.\n\nAmazon is expected to yield incremental tax revenue of $3.2 billion there over the next 20 years.\n\nThe arrangements have drawn the ire of Amazon critics including incoming Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district neighbors Long Island City. \u201cAmazon is a billion-dollar company,\u201d she tweeted late Monday night. \"The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here.\u201d\n\nNew York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson piled on. \"Amazon is one of the richest companies in the world, but you can't put a price on community input, which has been missing throughout this entire process,\" he said in a statement, adding that the city council was excluded from negotiations.\n\nOther critics have slammed the entire process, framing it as a bait-and-switch that let Amazon extract hefty giveaways in exchange for placing its new offices in areas it probably would have chosen anyway.\n\n\"Amazon demanded subsidies and terms from cities all over the country, demanded those terms be kept secret, then reneged on its promise to locate thousands of jobs,\" said Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute, in a statement Tuesday. \"Amazon is now treating even the biggest of American cities with the same disrespect it shows for the suppliers and the merchants who depend on its website to reach customers.\"\n\nLawmakers representing Virginia greeted the announcement as broadly positive \u2014 with some caveats.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, speaking at an event in Washington Tuesday morning, said the selection of Crystal City will benefit the whole region, including Maryland and D.C. He added, however, that he hopes some of the subcontractor jobs related to Amazon's new outpost will end up in \"more remote communities in Virginia.\" His colleague, Sen. Tim Kaine, gave the deal an unreserved thumbs up.\n\nAnd Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), whose district will now include Amazon's Virginia campus, praised the selection for diversifying the region's tax base and spurring investments in education. Northern Virginia has become an \"economic and cultural dynamo,\" he said in a statement.\n\nBut he also acknowledged Amazon's arrival will bring challenges and said he expects his constituents will have questions about the impacts on traffic, quality of life and economic equality.\n\n\"These questions, and maybe even some serious concerns, are entirely legitimate,\" Beyer said. \"I intend to take the lead in making sure that good questions get equally good answers and that all voices are heard.\"\n\nState leaders remained bullish on the overall impact for residents of the places Amazon is setting up shop. Virginia and Tennessee Govs. Ralph Northam and Bill Haslam both cheered the news in statements, projecting it will spur economic development in their states.\n\n\"I believe that Virginia's proposal to Amazon represents a new model of economic development for the 21st century,\" Northam said at an event in Crystal City Tuesday. The state's deal with Amazon includes funding for science and technology education and transportation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got more work to do,\" Northam continued. \"This project will enable Virginia to provide needed investments in education and infrastructure.\"\n\nIn Nashville, the incentives for creating 5,000 high-paying jobs amount to $102 million. Its tax impact there is projected to be more than $1 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nNashville's consolation prize helps offset burgeoning concern that Amazon's selection further proves the tech industry has disproportionately benefited wealthy, coastal communities. Nevertheless, it's clear Amazon's hunt led it to East Coast urban centers with large, vibrant economies.\n\n\"It seems quaint now but the idea of [choosing] an up-and-coming Midwestern metro that's on the cusp of breaking through would be very good geographically for the nation,\" said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \"In retrospect it's pretty clear that's not ... how Big Tech works.\"\n\nAshley Gold, Gloria Pazmino, Rosa Goldensohn and Cristiano Lima contributed to this report.", "International new student enrollment dips for second year\n\nWith help from Caitlin Emma\n\nEditor's Note: This edition of Free Morning Education is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Education subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pro's comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy tools and services, click here.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNUMBER OF NEW INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS DROPS \u2014 AGAIN: The number of new college students from abroad coming to the United States for post-secondary education has declined for the second year in a row, according to new figures out today.

Some Republicans, led by Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), want to terminate the $7,500 credit, saying it costs taxpayers billions, largely benefits wealthy Americans and is no longer necessary to help the industry. The next few months would be the last chance for GOP lawmakers to push through legislation to kill the credit \u2014 Democrats gearing up to control the House next year are prepared to defend it.\n\nOn the other hand: A coalition of carmakers and environmental groups launching today wants Congress to go another way: Reform the tax credit and keep it alive longer. The EV Drive Coalition, which includes GM, Nissan, Tesla and the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, wants to lift a cap on the number of consumers who can benefit from the credit (200,000 per manufacturer). \u201cChoosing not to reform the tax credit will severely hinder America\u2019s ability to compete in a global market,\u201d the group said in a press release. The proposal largely tracks with a bill from Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) that would remove the cap, but phase out the credits entirely by 2022.

Several House Democrats from the region have been elevated to powerful positions, including incoming Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.), a senior member on Ways and Means. But, as Curtis writes, \u201cthe chances of getting any of the roughly $13 billion needed to build the Hudson River tunnel, or even $1.6 billion for a new Portal Bridge, remain unclear. Any proposal would have to get through the Senate, which will have a larger Republican majority, and Trump would need to support it, too.\u201d\n\nAlso read: POLITICO New York\u2019s Dana Rubinstein on the renewed hopes of progress on the project.\n\n** A message from PlanetM \u2013 Michigan, where big ideas in mobility are born: When it comes to mobility, safety is no accident in Michigan.

The IRS released rules on virtual or digital currencies like bitcoin in 2014 \u2014 the agency\u2019s first and last word on cryptocurrency to date. It\u2019s not that the IRS is unaware \u2014 the agency receives lots of letters, James Beatty of the IRS associate chief counsel office said at the AICPA National Tax Conference, and he and his colleagues encourage taxpayers to keep it up. \u201cWe do read them all, and they\u2019re extremely helpful,\u201d Beatty said. But he said he's not in a position to forecast when an update will emerge, particularly with so many IRS resources tied up in crafting rules on the new tax law that took effect at the start of this year, H.R. 1 (115).\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cCertainly we\u2019re aware that taxpayers are interested in and looking for more guidance,\u201d Beatty later told Morning Tax. \u201cI think that\u2019s about all I can say.\u201d Under the 2014 guidance, the IRS treats virtual currency as property for tax purposes. Foreign exchange rules don\u2019t apply.\n\nBut beyond that bit of black-and-white clarity, much remains unsettled. Lawmakers are frustrated, and in September, Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) led a congressional letter demanding the IRS \u201cexpeditiously issue more robust guidance clarifying taxpayers\u2019 obligations when using virtual currencies.\u201d Accountants attending Monday's meeting said the IRS update should address valuation concerns, expensing questions and the idea of exempting transactions below a certain amount. AICPA has endorsed a minimum threshold of $200. The preliminary IRS guidance from 2014 remains open for comment.\n\nTaxpayers would also like guidance on like-kind exchanges for cryptocurrency trades involving more than one type of digital currency. The new tax law disallowed like-kind tax breaks for everything outside of real estate, but the IRS never weighed in definitively on whether they were allowed before that for cryptocurrency, save for consistency advice when making like-kind claims. For example, the agency advised using the same virtual currency exchanges for valuation.\n\nThat said, such information is barely a drop in the bucket for some. One accountant at the meeting said he had a client whose entire life is on a flash drive and he had questions for estate tax planning, yet he sounded hopeful of guidance eventually emerging to help settle valuation questions. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t died yet,\u201d the attendee said.\n\nIT\u2019S TUESDAY at Morning Tax, and Congress is back.

Regulators from the Treasury Department and IRS are spending an undue amount of time dealing with extra eyes from the White House Office of Management and Budget, according to Tom West, who was at Treasury until just days ago. Speaking at a professional conference in California over the weekend, West suggested the new agreement that involves centralized review by OMB\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs saps Treasury resources while officials work to issue rules on the new tax cuts law, Tax Notes reported. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard when our expert tax people are spending their time educating OMB on \u2018Tax 101\u2019-type questions, and we have all of these very significant regulations we\u2019re working on and trying to get out,\u201d said West, who had been Treasury tax legislative counsel.\n\nBut OIRA guards against a tax \"deep state,\" several tax lobbyists with Republican roots told Morning Tax. They see the extra step as a check against regulatory overreach, particularly from long-entrenched bureaucrats embedded within the rule-making apparatus. \u201cMy sense having participated to some degree and observed closely is that the value added is mostly intangible, but that from a stakeholder standpoint it plays an important \u2018safety\u2019 role to make sure any regs comport with the administration\u2019s overarching policy goals,\u201d one of the lobbyists said on condition of anonymity because of client sensitivities. For what it\u2019s worth, West\u2019s tenure in Treasury\u2019s Office of Tax Policy dated back to the last administration, and he wasn\u2019t alone as a holdover.\n\nSTAYING POWER: Rulemaking represents one of the later stages of development for the new law, followed only by possible reconsiderations, PwC Managing Director Mark Prater said at the AICPA meeting. He said that final stage could yield some eventual tweaks but the core of the law will likely remain largely intact, yours truly reports. Even though it was passed on a partisan basis, six years of mostly bipartisan work underpinned many of the changes enacted under the new law, said Prater, who was previously the Senate Finance Committee's top tax counsel. Some alterations could come through technical corrections legislation, possibly during the lame-duck session beginning this week, and factors such as U.S. economic performance and trading partners' policy responses will also play a part in driving possible changes, Prater said.\n\nSURVEY SAYS: Early reviews of economic data since the new law passed show \u201clittle clear evidence that it is drastically reshaping the way in which most companies invest and spend,\u201d though it will take years for such effects to be demonstrated, The New York Times reports. Consumer spending has jumped but the law\u2019s chief supporters also promised better business investments, which was robust the first two quarters of this year but slowed in the third quarter. Data for the current final quarter is months away. In the meantime, other evidence of the new law\u2019s impact is piling up: increased corporate stock buybacks and worker bonus announcements, but also higher federal debt and wage growth rates that have yet to live up to promises.\n\nSALT IN THE WOUND: The new tax law\u2019s $10,000 limit on federal deductions for state and local taxes could have cost the House GOP dearly, namely in higher-income suburban areas, Yahoo Finance reports. A tab of last week\u2019s election results showed that nine of the 25 congressional districts that use the deduction the most are controlled by Republicans in the current Congress, but six of them voted for Democratic challengers Nov. 6 and one in California remains too close to call. \u201cAll of the top 25 districts straddle the largest U.S. cities: New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.,\u201d the story says. \u201cThe common trend: All have expensive housing markets with homeowners who commute to the city for work.\u201d\n\nINTERNATIONAL UPDATE\n\nDIGITAL OLIVE BRANCH. German officials offered backing for a temporary European Union digital tax on revenues in January 2021 if a global deal fails to materialize, report POLITICO Europe\u2019s Bjarke Smith-Meyer and Laura Kayali. The French have pushed a much quicker timeline to implement the tax, which would hit U.S. companies Google, Facebook and Amazon, but Germans have been reluctant, in part over concern that President Donald Trump could retaliate with tariffs on German cars. German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told Der Spiegel he would prefer a digital taxation deal through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, but added that \u201cwe should take the lead at European level\u201d if \u201cinternational understanding fails.\u201d\n\nSTATE NEWS\n\nAMAZON SPLITS THE BABY: Amazon selected the Crystal City section of Arlington in Northern Virginia as one of two sites for new headquarters locations, along with Long Island City, N.Y., reports the Wall Street Journal.

It\u2019s unclear if those Democrats will try to sink the pact, but we do know USMCA will need at least 10 Democratic votes to win approval. Plus, the Trump administration is getting closer to a verdict on auto tariffs. Let\u2019s start here:\n\nPROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS WARY OF NEW NAFTA DEAL: Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus were at the forefront of the intense but ultimately unsuccessful fight to defeat trade promotion authority in 2015. They had more success in helping prevent the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact from even getting a vote. Now, the group is flagging concerns about the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\n\u201cWhile some of the provisions in labor are stronger, the enforcement is non-existent,\u201d caucus co-chair Rep. Mark Pocan said at an event Monday at AFL-CIO headquarters. \u201cSo you can have nice words but [if] there\u2019s no way to enforce them, it doesn\u2019t really do anything.\u201d\n\nNew guard: It is unclear whether the group \u2014 which will have 20 new members after last week\u2019s elections \u2014 will try to sink the pact when it comes up for a vote. But many incoming and existing members were skeptical of the deal, including Andy Levin, who will take the seat held by his father, Rep. Sander Levin (D-Mich.).\n\nDrug patent issue: A provision that requires Canada and Mexico to provide 10 years of test data protection for biologics medicine is another area of concern for progressives because of the potential to delay the introduction of cheaper generic versions, as is the absence of any measure in the agreement to address global climate change, said Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who was reelected to her 11th term in Congress.\n\nAnother veteran, Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), said in a statement that the Trump administration\u2019s implementing bill must ensure effective enforcement of the agreement\u2019s labor and environmental provisions. It also must have \u201cthe ability to rein in prescription price gouging\u201d to get his vote.\n\nA House Democratic aide stressed \u201cthere\u2019s a ton of scrutiny and analysis still to be done\u201d on the new agreement, so it\u2019s too early to say how party leaders will vote. However, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi will insist that the labor and environmental provisions are enforceable, the aide said.\n\nIT'S TUESDAY, NOV. 13!

Introductory remarks by Nelson Mullins partner David Wilkins, a former U.S. ambassador to Canada, will be followed by a POLITICO reporter briefing. RSVP here.\n\nSOME NUMBERS TO PONDER ON USMCA VOTE COUNT: House Democrats will be important for congressional approval of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, but just how many Democratic votes will be needed to win approval of the pact is still far from clear.\n\nThe latest tally from last week\u2019s elections shows there will be at least 208 Republican House members next year. That\u2019s just 10 short of the 218 votes needed to win approval of the revamped trade deal if every Republican votes in favor of the agreement. That could be a tall order for President Donald Trump.\n\nHistory as a rule of thumb: In one of the closet trade votes of the past 20 years, 27 Republicans voted against the U.S.-Central America-Dominican Republic free trade agreement in 2005, requiring 15 Democrats to help eke out the 217-215 passage.\n\nIn another close trade vote, 28 House Democrats joined with 191 Republicans in 2015 to approve trade promotion authority by a vote of 219-211. Because of retirements this year and election losses in 2016, only 23 of those House Democrats remain.\n\nTRUMP TO HOLD MEETING ON AUTO TARIFFS TODAY: Trump is set to meet with his trade team today to discuss the Commerce Department\u2019s Section 232 probe into auto imports, as the White House is circulating a draft report, Bloomberg reported Monday. Sources familiar with the matter did not divulge conclusions of the report, which is not formally due until February.\n\nTrump has threatened to slap a 20 percent or 25 percent duty on imports of autos and auto parts to protect U.S. national security. The Trump administration negotiated quotas with Canada and Mexico to exempt their current exports from any potential tariffs. It also told the EU and Japan it wouldn\u2019t impose those duties as long as trade talks were making progress.\n\nUSTR WON\u2019T SAY WHO\u2019S GOING TO APEC: The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is declining to say who is representing the United States at this week\u2019s APEC ministerial meeting in Papua New Guinea. Vice President Mike Pence is filling in for Trump at the annual summit, which is being held on Sunday. But that\u2019s preceded by an APEC ministerial meeting on Thursday, which is usually attended by the U.S. trade representative.\n\nIf USTR Robert Lighthizer does not attend, it would be the second APEC ministerial he missed this year; Deputy USTR Jeffrey Gerrish substituted for Lighthizer at the earlier meeting in May and at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in August. Lighthizer also had U.S. Ambassador to the WTO Dennis Shea fill in for him at the G-20 trade ministers meeting in September.\n\nPence held talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today in Tokyo and will also stop in Singapore for the East Asia Summit before the APEC meeting.\n\nBilateral (still) trumps multilateral: Any talk of potential trade deals will be centered on bilateral negotiations, a senior administration official said last week. The official noted that \u201cwe\u2019ve seen non-inclusive and lopsided growth\u201d as a result of some multilateral trade pacts.\n\n\u201cThe president said a year ago that we stand ready to negotiate bilateral trade agreements with any country in the Indo-Pacific that is willing to abide by the principles of fairness and reciprocity,\u201d the official said in a call with reporters.\n\nTRUMP COMPLAINS OF \u2018UNFAIR\u2019 EU TRADE AHEAD OF MEETINGS: Trump, fresh off his trip to France, took to Twitter on Monday morning to renew his criticism that other countries have long taken advantage of the U.S. on military spending and trade. Trump\u2019s comments come ahead of Lighthizer\u2019s meeting with EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m on Wednesday to push toward U.S.-EU trade talks.\n\nTrump will also meet with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker later this month at the G-20. Formal trade talks could formally begin as soon as mid-January.\n\nWTO MEMBERS OBJECT TO EU POST-BREXIT PLANS ON IMPORT QUOTAS: More than 25 World Trade Organization members on Monday expressed their concerns over EU plans to split import quotas for industrial and agricultural goods with the United Kingdom once it leaves the bloc.\n\nTwelve countries \u2014 including the U.S., Brazil and China \u2014 issued a joint communication stating that a proposal issued by the bloc earlier this year \u201camounts to a reduction in the quality and level of access provided by the EU to WTO members.\u201d The communication also complained that the EU did not specify how it would account for $800 billion worth of trade between the U.K. and the EU-27.\n\nAnother 15 countries, such as Russia and Japan, expressed their concern about the proposed changes at a WTO Council for Trade in Goods meeting on Monday. More here.\n\nCANADA COURTS CHINA TRADE TALKS: Canadian Trade Minister Jim Carr said Monday that Ottawa is exploring a variety of sector-specific trade pacts with China that could result in a comprehensive trade agreement.\n\nSpeaking on a conference call from China, Carr said Canada is involved in talks on a number of products China is interested in, including energy and agricultural goods.\n\nUSMCA on the mind: Carr said the Chinese asked about USMCA, particularly the provision that adds a hurdle for any North American country looking to negotiate a pact with a nonmarket economy. However, he downplayed the significance of the provision. Pro Canada\u2019s Alex Panetta has more.\n\nFIRRMA PILOT PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING: U.S. companies must now report any foreign transactions that might fall under a new trial program as part of the new Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act. The law is meant to crack down on risks posed by foreign investments, with a focus on Chinese companies that allegedly steal U.S. technology.\n\nThe pilot program, which went into effect on Saturday, will require notification of transactions that grant foreign firms a non-controlling stake in U.S. companies that produce critical technology. The transactions covered under the program could involve granting the foreign companies access to or the ability to influence decisions involving such technology.\n\nEither way it\u2019s going to force companies that don\u2019t export to determine whether a transaction exposes a technology subject to export restrictions to the increased oversight.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all export control attorneys right now, because it\u2019s forcing people to get into the weeds of the Commerce Control List like they never have before,\u201d said Kevin Wolf, a partner at Akin Gump and former top Commerce Department export official under the Obama administration. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a subjective judgment about whether an investment is going to be considered a national security concern because it\u2019s a mandatory filing requirement with significant penalties for not complying.\u201d\n\nINTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT\n\n\u2014 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and his Chinese counterpart have resumed high-level talks to ease trade tensions, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\n\u2014 U.S. says India paid out more in cotton subsidies than WTO allows, Reuters reports.\n\n\u2014 Ohio Democratic Sen.

The transaction is expected to close in 2019, and Evergreen Coast Capital\u2014the private equity subsidiary of the activist investment fund that first made an aggressive takeover bid\u2014will be a minority investor.\n\nVirence Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bob Segert, who will lead the combined company, had little health experience prior to his appointment to Virence\u2019s top spot in September. Demko says maybe his IT background \u2014 which included serving as executive chairman of call center software company Aspect \u2014 could be a good thing for athenahealth. \u201cA lot of what these public EHRs need is to...embrace the handbook of platform-as-a-service,\u201d she says. The software platform model in other areas such as payroll processing often has higher margins than health technology, Demko added.\n\nDemko said she\u2019ll be tracking whether athenahealth\u2019s existing customer base shows interest in buying other health IT products from Veritas and Virence\u2019s current portfolio, including IT for financial management, human resources and clinical processes.\n\nAthenahealth's sale, has raised concerns among customers that the company will lose its defining element of good service for doctors, especially if new management cuts staff.

No one has been able to solve it.\u201d\n\nPolkinghorn said then that the business plan was to have patients pay Driver $3,000 to process their tumor genetics and match them with a clinical trial or treatment. The company had a partnership with GoFundMe to help launch campaigns for those who couldn\u2019t afford it. Another idea was to get employers to pay for the service as a benefit for their employees.\n\nAt the time, the company had only about 300 paying customers.\n\neHealth Tweet of the day: Bob Wachter @Bob_Wachter A bit sad re: selloff of @athenahealth http://bit.ly/2zNhoA5 When I interviewed @Jonathan_Bush in '14, I found myself rooting for him\u2013a passionate disruptor.

The ECHO Institute trains other provider groups to connect their primary care physicians with their own specialists, and gives them access to a video-conferencing platform.\n\nThe opioid legislation directs HHS Secretary Alex Azar to give preference when doling out grants to opioid recovery centers that use such \u201ctechnology-enabled collaborative learning\u201d models. The problem is that the ECHO Institute must now keep up with increasing demand, Arora says \u2014 they\u2019re training more than 100 people a month to run their own educational models, and there\u2019s a waiting list.\n\nThe ECHO Institute\u2019s own funding is another challenge, though that could change soon. The 2016 ECHO Act directs HHS to publish a report on the efficacy of such a model, how it could be used to address a shortage of specialists in certain geographic areas, and potential funding options.\n\nPRIVACY PATROL: Facebook has hired a veteran of the Interactive Advertising Bureau to focus on privacy issues, our POLITICO colleague Margaret Harding McGill reports.\n\nBrad Weltman previously lobbied for the trade group, whose members include Facebook, Google and Microsoft, at the House and Senate Commerce Committees and at the FTC. He announced in an email obtained by POLITICO that he will head to Facebook to work on \"all things privacy\" in December. Before joining IAB, Weltman worked as a policy adviser to former Sen. Harry Reid and the Magazine Publishers of America.\n\nAs Morning eHealth\u2019s Darius Tahir has reported, federal privacy policy and its health implications could garner more congressional attention this session, especially in the House. Frank Pallone, the presumptive Energy and Commerce chairman, has drawn up a priority list that includes data privacy. He has also notably opposed the 42 CFR Part 2 rule change that would have made it easier for doctors to access patients\u2019 substance use information. (That provision passed the House earlier in the year but was not included in the opioid package.)\n\n... In other privacy news, the EU has proffered a blueprint for what our privacy legislation should look like. The European Commission wrote up some recommendations in response to a request from the Department of Commerce for input into the legislative process, our POLITICO Europe colleague Laurens Cerulus reports.\n\nThe commission argued that a \u201cmodern, balanced and flexible privacy regime\u201d has four parts: \u201can overarching law; a core set of data protection principles; enforceable individual rights; and finally, an independent supervisory authority with effective powers to ensure the enforcement of those rules.\u201d\n\nTheir specific suggestions include data breach notification requirements, strengthening the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s role as an enforcer and putting in place sanctions to deter data misuse.\n\nPOLITICO obtained a copy of the contribution, which was drawn up by the European Union\u2019s executive arm. It was submitted in response to the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration\u2019s request for comments on potential legislation that would impose stricter privacy requirements on companies dealing with personal data.\n\n...Columbia computer science professor Steven Bellovin also shared some recommendations on a privacy paradigm overhaul, arguing that there should be a \u201cmore modern definition of \u2018injury,\u2019\u201d \u2014 limiting it to credit theft or health information disclosure risks ignoring other dangerous scenarios such as people being outed as gay because of their membership in Facebook groups. \u201cEven for those who advocate less regulation, more clarity here would be useful; it would lend more predictability to the FTC\u2019s enforcement actions.\u201d\n\nPEOPLE IN THE NEWS: Lisa Suennen, previously managing partner at Venture Valkyrie and senior managing director of GE Ventures\u2019 health care arm has moved to Manatt Phelps & Phillips LLP to lead its venture capital fund.\n\nWHAT WE'RE CLICKING\n\n\u2014 Vijay Pande\u2019s piece in the Scientific American blog, \u201cHow to Engineer Biology,\u201d and Derek Lowe\u2019s response in the Science Translational Medicine blog\n\n\u2014 HealthDataManagement reports on Vanderbilt\u2019s efforts with multi-factor authentication", "Deal or no deal?\n\nWith help from Doug Palmer and Ted Hesson\n\nEditor's Note: This edition of Free Morning Shift is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Employment & Immigration subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pro's comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy tools and services, click here.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDEAL OR NO DEAL?: At a Monday event at AFL-CIO headquarters to welcome more than 20 new House members, Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair Rep. Mark Pocan (D.-Wisc.) said his group had major concerns about the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\n\u201cWhile some of the provisions in labor are stronger, the enforcement is non-existent,\u201d Pocan said. \u201cSo you can have nice words but [if] there\u2019s no way to enforce them, it doesn\u2019t really do anything.\u201d A House Democratic aide stressed \u201cthere\u2019s a ton of scrutiny and analysis still to be done\u201d on the new agreement, so it\u2019s too early to say how party leaders will respond when Trump submits the agreement to Congress for a vote. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi will insist that the labor and environmental provisions are actually enforceable, the aide said.\n\nBut Pelosi said last week that \u201cMexico has to pass a law about labor rights in Mexico, so that has not happened yet and that is a predicate of this agreement,\u201d according to the New York Times. \u201cMost important of all are the enforcement provisions in terms of labor and the environment. Enforcement, enforcement, enforcement.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. secured a provision in the new deal that requires between 40 percent and 45 percent of a vehicle to be made by workers earning on average at least $16 per hour, POLITICO\u2019s Adam Behsudi has reported. But labor leaders say the $16 per hour minimum is \u201carguably too low\u201d to discourage companies from outsourcing for cheap labor and could lose its benefit because it\u2019s not tied to inflation.

The announcement could come as soon as this week.\n\nChief of staff John F. Kelly is \u201cfighting Nielsen\u2019s pending dismissal and attempting to postpone it,\u201d according to the Post, but his future in the White House is also uncertain. More here.\n\nBORDER HARDBALL: Democrats warn they\u2019ll play hardball if Republicans refuse to budge in negotiations over funding the border wall \u2014 a major bone of contention that threatens to partially shut down the government.\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee ranking member Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said Monday he is \u201cperfectly willing\u201d to consider increasing funding for barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border in a deal with Republicans on immigration reform. But if that deal is \u201ca wall or nothing,\u201d he says, \u201cthey\u2019re going to get nothing,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Jennifer Scholtes reports.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see the president sit down with the Republican and Democratic leadership and talk about immigration reform,\u201d the Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member said on a call with reporters Monday. But he added that he\u2019s \u201cnot going to negotiate ahead of time and against myself\u201d over how much Congress will carve out of Homeland Security funding to fund the wall.\n\nThe Vermont Democrat said he\u2019s skeptical that Republicans will allow the government to be shut down partially if they fail to secure increased wall funding ahead of the Dec. 7 deadline. \u201cFor the president to say, \u2018We\u2019ll close down Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, State, finance, Homeland Security, Interior, Transportation and everything else, unless I get my symbolic wall,\u2019 I\u2019m not sure too many people who are thinking about running for reelection are going to want to vote for that,\u201d Leahy said. He also said he sees little sign that DHS can spend more than the $1.6 billion the Senate is prepared to deliver for the border wall for fiscal 2019. More from Scholtes here.\n\nVisa Update\n\nFOREIGN STUDENTS SKIP THE STATES: The flow of foreign college students coming to the U.S. dropped nearly 7 percent compared to the last year, according to the 2018 Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange, released today. The U.S. is still the top destination in the world for international students, but the slump cements \u201c a slide that college leaders have blamed on President Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Benjamin Wermund reports.\n\nInternational students at U.S. colleges and universities contributed some $39 billion to the U.S. economy and supported more than 455,622 jobs during the 2017-18 school year, said a separate report released today by NAFSA: Association of International Educators. But Wermund reports that the authors of the report, (which has been supported by the State Department since 1972) downplayed Trump\u2019s role in the attrition of foreign students and instead credited competition from universities in other countries and the rising U.S. tuitions. However, \u201cAmerican colleges have largely blamed Trump because foreign competitors use the president\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric to aggressively recruit international students and faculty.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has made several moves to tighten standards in the student visa program as part of its broad immigration overhaul. One proposal would place a maximum period of stay on F-1 student visas, POLITICO\u2019s Ted Hesson has reported. Under a policy enacted Oct. 1, international students begin to accrue \u201cunlawful presence\u201d if they remain in the country past the school year, with a limited exception for students with pending visa applications.\n\nICE also plans to issue a final rule in March that would raise visa fees for international students. More on that from Hesson here and more on those numbers from Wermund here.\n\nSHERROD FOR PRESIDENT?: Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) who reclaimed his seat by nearly 6 points last Tuesday, is now considering \u201cseriously\u201d a run for the oval office in 2020. In interviews with cleveland.com and The Columbus Dispatch, Brown said he\u2019s been receiving more and more calls inside and outside the state to weigh a presidential run.\n\nBuckeye State voters mostly elected Republicans last week, minus a small handful of Democratic House seats. But Brown says wagering on workers sealed his reelection in the red state \u2014 and should be a \u201cblueprint\u201d for Democrats in 2020.\n\n\"My message clearly appeals to Democrats, Republicans and independents,\" Brown told cleveland.com. \"We showed you can get votes by being authentic and standing up for workers. People in Washington don't understand the dignity of work.\" More from POLITICO\u2019s Rebecca Morin here.\n\nCHAMBER EYES BIPARTISANSHIP: With the Houses of Congress divided in the next session, Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue is eyeing potential policy areas where Democrats and Republicans can find some consensus.\n\nOn infrastructure: \u201cRepublicans are going to have to accept that we need more revenue from dedicated user fees. Democrats are going to have to accept that private investment must be a big part of the solution,\u201d Donahue says. \u201cBoth sides should look at this as an investment in our nation\u2019s long-term competitiveness and future prosperity.\u201d\n\nOn immigration: \u201cIf lawmakers find the middle ground, work through the tough issues, and finally address this long-simmering challenge, they will help solve the people gap in our country and reaffirm our legacy of welcoming the world\u2019s best talent and hardest workers.\u201d\n\nRead his article on the Chamber\u2019s website here.\n\nHIRING LEVELS OFF: After a rise in hiring growth over 2017 and most of this year, LinkedIn\u2019s Workforce Report for November 2018 says that trend may be levelling off. According to LinkedIn\u2019s user data, gross hiring in the U.S. was 3.8 percent higher than in October 2017, but seasonally-adjusted national hiring was down 0.3 percent from September to October 2018. Those numbers are notably lower than some of the hiring spikes earlier this summer, but LinkedIn\u2019s economic team says \u201ctime will tell whether we\u2019re seeing a temporary breather or a more sustained pause.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump touted accelerating job growth and wages in the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 October jobs report. But POLITICO\u2019s Ian Kullgren notes that the labor force participation rate \u2014 the share of people actually looking for a job \u2014 edged up slightly but remained close to 63 percent in October, near its lowest level since the 1970s.

But amid the crush of other year-end legislative priorities, the chances of finishing the farm bill in 2018 appear even dicier.\n\n\u2014 House Agriculture leaders met Monday but emerged without much progress to speak of, apparently. There was talk of putting together a bipartisan House offer, which could spur negotiations among the House and Senate agriculture chiefs toward a deal.\n\n\u2014 Senate Ag Chairman Pat Roberts has a lot on his plate, like passing a final farm bill and making big decisions about his political future. The Kansas Republican, who faced a bruising primary challenge in 2014, is up for reelection in 2020 in a state where Democrats are suddenly emboldened.\n\nLONG LAME-DUCK TO-DO LIST BEYOND THE FARM BILL: House and Senate Agriculture leaders are hoping to strike a bipartisan deal in time to pass a final farm bill before January, but they\u2019ll need to compete for floor time and legislative oxygen with plenty of other big-ticket issues. The Senate is expected to churn through additional nominations, both parties and chambers will hold leadership elections \u2014 and then there\u2019s the annual year-end spending showdown.\n\n\u2014 Congress still needs to fund large portions of the government by Dec. 7, when a temporary stopgap expires. There are just 12 joint legislative days until then, and a partisan struggle over funds for President Donald Trump\u2019s U.S.-Mexico border wall is sure to complicate spending talks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see the president sit down with the Republican and Democratic leadership and talk about immigration reform,\u201d Patrick Leahy, ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Monday. \u201c... If it\u2019s a wall or nothing, then they\u2019re going to get nothing.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Additional tax legislation could be on the agenda: The Senate has yet to take up the House-passed \u201cTax Cuts 2.0\u201d legislative package, which would permanently establish parts of the 2017 GOP tax code rewrite. Technical fixes to that overhaul, H.R. 1 (115), and a separate extension of expired temporary tax breaks, known as \u201cextenders,\u201d could also be on deck. (The slate of extenders includes biofuel tax credits.)\n\nAll of that leaves farm bill negotiators with little wiggle room. To shuttle a final bill through both chambers, they\u2019ll need to reach a deal quickly, but there\u2019s little indication they\u2019re close to resolving some of the biggest sticking points.\n\nHouse Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway and ranking member Collin Peterson huddled Monday for less than 30 minutes, our Helena Bottemiller Evich and Liz Crampton report. Asked if any decisions were made, Conaway only said, \u201cWe\u2019re still having conversations.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Comparisons to a stranded turtle are never good: Going into the meeting, Conaway said negotiations were moving at the pace of a \u201cturtle on the fence post \u2014 legs are going 900 miles an hour, but you can\u2019t make any progress.\u201d\n\n\u2014 House offer? The Texas Republican suggested prior to the meeting that he and Peterson are looking to \u201cfigure out a way to get to a House offer.\u201d That would require a new degree of cooperation between the duo.\n\nConaway was upbeat heading into the meeting, but all signs pointed to a frosty face-to-face: he and Peterson both left in a hurried manner. Conaway gave terse answers in a brief interview with Liz. At one point, Conaway, who exited first, exchanged a stern look with Peterson, who didn\u2019t offer comment.\n\nMark it down: Conaway confirmed he\u2019ll keep the top Republican spot on House Ag, staying on as ranking member. He also acknowledged that the dynamics were shifting, with Democrats set to take over the House in 2019 and Peterson expected to become chairman.\n\nHAPPY TUESDAY, NOV. 13!

Get the details and sign up.\n\nROBERTS FACES DIFFICULT 2020 DECISION: If the pressure of passing a new farm bill wasn\u2019t enough, Roberts also needs to figure out his political future. The 82-year-old Kansas Republican is up for reelection in 2020, and it might not be smooth sailing to his fifth term in the Senate.\n\n\u2014 Roberts held off a Tea Party-backed primary challenger in 2014 with less than 50 percent of the vote, after facing repeated attacks and questions about his residency in the state. (The Kansas City Star reports that Roberts purchased a home in Topeka in 2016.)\n\n\u2014 Kansas Democrats are also likely to be fired up in 2020 given last week\u2019s midterms, when they won the governorship by 4.5 percentage points and flipped a Kansas City-area Republican district by 9 points.\n\n\u2014 Giving up the gavel: Roberts, who has held the Senate Agriculture gavel since 2015, wouldn\u2019t be able to stay on as chairman beyond 2020 under Senate Republican rules, which limit committee chairmanships to six years.\n\nPROGRESSIVES COULD BE ROADBLOCK TO TRADE PACT APPROVAL: The Congressional Progressive Caucus fought against trade promotion authority in 2015 and helped fend off a vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Next up: The so-called U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which is expected to come before Congress in 2019.\n\nCPC Co-Chairman Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) said Monday that the group has major concerns about the deal, our Pro Trade colleagues tell MA. \u201cWhile some of the provisions in labor are stronger, the enforcement is non-existent,\u201d Pocan said at an event at AFL-CIO headquarters with incoming members of Congress, several of whom made similar remarks.\n\nCome January, when Democrats control the House, the liberal caucus will have at least some influence over the fate of the new North American trade pact. The latest tally shows roughly 200 Republicans in the House next year (with a handful of races still uncalled), many of whom would likely vote for the deal. But Democratic leaders might be less inclined to shove the trade pact through the House if a large and influential segment of their party is opposed to it.\n\nROW CROPS\n\n\u2014 Canada talking ag trade with China: Canada\u2019s trade minister, Jim Carr, told reporters on Monday that Canada is exploring a number of sector-specific trade pacts with Beijing that could turn into a broader trade deal. He said ag is one sector being discussed. POLITICO Canada\u2019s Alexander Panetta has more.\n\n\u2014 U.S. calls out India\u2019s cotton subsidies: New Delhi pays much more in cotton subsidies than it officially declares to the WTO, the U.S. said in an analysis submitted to the global trade body on Monday. India is permitted to pay up to 10 percent of the value of production, the U.S. report said, but that figure has ranged from 53 percent to 81 percent since 2010. Reuters has more.\n\n\u2014 SNAP participation drops for immigrant families: Rhetoric and policy proposals surrounding immigration appear to be having a real chilling effect on SNAP participation, according to data unveiled at an American Public Health Association meeting this week. Preliminary 2018 data show a 10 percent drop in enrollment among SNAP-eligible immigrant families who have been in the country less than five years. Read more here.\n\n\u2014 Sinema wins Arizona Senate race: Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema won the close race for Arizona\u2019s open Senate seat over Republican Rep. Martha McSally. It\u2019s the second Senate pickup for Democrats this cycle, lowering the GOP\u2019s net gain in the chamber, and their first Senate win in Arizona since 1988. Campaign Pro\u2019s James Arkin has the story.\n\n\u2014 Bad weather slows Kansas harvest and planting: Rain and snow in Kansas have kept harvesters on the sidelines, stranded soybeans in the field and left the ground too wet to start planting winter wheat. Now there\u2019s more snow on the way, as the hits keep coming for Midwestern farmers, Bloomberg reports. (North Dakota is dealing with similar problems, per Agweek.)\n\n\u2014 Charting access at Interior under Zinke: During Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke\u2019s first year-and-a-half in office, fossil fuel corporations, mining companies or related advocacy operations had 280 meetings or calls with high-level political appointees, The Guardian and Pacific Standard found in reviewing records. That\u2019s more than twice the access that conservation NGOs got to the same officials.

A House Armed Services subcommittee and House Homeland Security subcommittee hold a joint hearing on cyber cooperation between DHS and DoD, featuring the top cyber officials at both departments: National Protection and Programs Directorate Undersecretary Chris Krebs and Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications Jeanette Manfra for DHS, alongside DoD\u2019s principal cyber adviser, Kenneth Rapuano.\n\nThe Senate Armed Services cyber subcommittee, meanwhile, will examine how the Pentagon purchases cybersecurity goods and services from the private sector. The witnesses are Francis Landolf, principal of Core Consulting; Ronald Nielson, vice president and chief technology officer of Parsons Corp.; Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and CTO of CrowdStrike; and John Davis, federal chief security officer for Palo Alto Networks.\n\nLegislatively, there aren\u2019t a whole lot of loose ends for the lame-duck session. The House still needs to pass a slightly amended bill (H.R. 3359) renaming and reorganizing NPPD into the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and there\u2019s little reason to think it won\u2019t. Senate sponsors of the Secure Election Act (S. 2593) have raised the possibility of moving that legislation during the lame duck, although chances of that happening seem slim. Democrats in the Senate plan to try to attach legislation protecting special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe to any moving target. And DHS, DOJ and a number of other departments with cyber responsibilities have fiscal 2019 spending bills pending, although a shutdown threat looms once again.\n\nHAPPY TUESDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

The contest between incumbent Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on both the Senate Commerce Committee and the Armed Services Cybersecurity Subcommittee, and Republican Gov. Rick Scott is in the midst of a recount, and the rhetoric is rising. Top Republicans, led by President Donald Trump, have accused Democrats and state officials of trying to steal the election without offering any evidence.

WE\u2019RE NO. 1! \u2014 Countries in North America, Europe and East Asia and the Pacific rank cyberattacks the No. 1 risk for doing business, according to a World Economic Forum study published Monday.

But here\u2019s an overlap between advanced economies and those that tend to place cyber atop their list: The forum blamed disruptive attacks like WannaCry and NotPetya last year for the rise. \u201cWe will look back at 2017 as the year that the world began to take seriously the potential extent of our vulnerability to cyber-attack disruptions,\u201d the study states.\n\nCATCHY NAME \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron released the \u201cParis call for trust and security in cyberspace\u201d on Monday in a bid for international cooperation to strengthen digital defenses, particularly on election security, attacks that limit internet availability and the theft of trade secrets. But, as expected, the U.S. wasn\u2019t one of the countries to sign up, although French officials said talks were continuing. Big U.S. companies like Google and Cisco enlisted, however. Among the more than 370 signatories are 27 of 29 NATO countries. \u201cThe internet is a space currently managed by a technical community of private players. But it\u2019s not governed. So now that half of humanity is online, we need to find new ways to organize the internet,\u201d an official from Macron\u2019s office told Reuters. \u201cOtherwise, the internet as we know it today \u2014 free, open and secure \u2014 will be damaged by the new threats.\u201d\n\nWANNACRY LIVES, PART I \u2014 The number of attempts to exploit the \u201cEternalBlue\u201d Microsoft Windows flaw made famous by the WannaCry ransomware continues to climb, according to the security firm Rapid7\u2019s third quarter threat report out today. \u201cThere are still hundreds of thousands of vulnerable and likely infected Microsoft file servers spread across the internet helping to keep this particular bane alive,\u201d Rapid7 researchers wrote. The report also found that exploitations of a MicroTik router flaw to run cryptocurrency miners have dropped off and the campaign appears to be \u201calmost completely neutralized.\u201d\n\nWANNACRY LIVES, PART II \u2014 As the widespread use of ransomware rises, the WannaCry exploit tops the list as the most commonly used, according to Kaspersky Lab\u2019s third quarter IT Threat Evolution Report released Monday. Despite Microsoft releasing a patch in early 2017, ransomware attacks using the EternalBlue vulnerability account for 29 percent of all attacks. Last year, WannaCry attacks accounted for only 17 percent. Overall, ransomware attacks have increased 39 percent since the last quarter, the report states. \u201cThe rising share of WannaCry attacks is another reminder that epidemics don\u2019t end as fast as they start; there are always long-running consequences,\u201d said Fedor Sinitsyn, security researcher at Kaspersky Lab.\n\nRECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY \u2014 \u201cEven if the Russian government did hack the Democratic National Committee in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, the DNC can\u2019t sue Moscow over it, the Russian government recently told a federal court.\u201d \u2026 \u201cAn elusive new hacker group is targeting Pakistani government and military organizations, especially its air force, with malware that can evade eight of the world\u2019s leading antivirus products, according to the security firm Cylance.\u201d\n\nTWEET OF THE DAY \u2014 Phew.\n\nQUICK BYTES\n\n\u2014 DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen could be pushed out very soon.

Trump told Acosta \u201cCNN should be ashamed\u201d for employing him during the back-and-forth, which included a White House staffer attempting to take the microphone out of Acosta\u2019s hand.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed last week that Acosta\u2019s pass was revoked due to the reporter \u201cplacing his hands on a young woman,\u201d but any contact appeared incidental. CNN is arguing in its suit that the pass was pulled as retaliation for aggressive coverage of the president.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n\u201cThis severe and unprecedented punishment is the culmination of years of hostility by President Trump against CNN and Acosta based on the contents of their reporting \u2014 an unabashed attempt to censor the press and exclude reporters from the White House who challenge and dispute the President\u2019s point of view,\u201d read the complaint.\n\nCNN argued in the complaint that Trump and White House staff violated Acosta's First and Fifth Amendment rights, and the network said it is seeking a declaration that taking away Acosta's credentials was unconstitutional.\n\nIn a lengthy statement on Tuesday, Sanders derided the suit as \u201cmore grandstanding from CNN\u201d and said that the White House will \u201cvigorously defend against this lawsuit.\u201d\n\nSanders cited dozens of hard pass holders employed by CNN and said, \u201cMr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment.\u201d Sanders described Acosta refusing to yield the mic to the press aide and alleged, \u201cThis was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters.\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cThe White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional. The First Amendment is not served when a single reporter, of more than 150 present, attempts to monopolize the floor. If there is no check on this type of behavior it impedes the ability of the President, the White House staff, and members of the media to conduct business.\u201d\n\nThe statement represented a stark shift from Sanders\u2019 previous comments on the matter, which have focused on the contact between Acosta and the press aide, and not his desire to ask additional questions.\n\nSanders\u2019 arguments about Acosta \u201cplacing his hands on\u201d the aide have been widely dismissed and were further weakened when she posted what appeared to many to be an altered video of the incident, designed to make the contact look more significant than it was.\n\nTrump said Friday that Acosta\u2019s \u201ca very unprofessional man\u201d and insinuated the pass was pulled because he acted irreverently in the White House. The president warned \u201cthere could be\u201d other journalists barred next.\n\nIn the suit, CNN\u2019s lawyers wrote that \u201cthe only reasonable inference from Defendants\u2019 conduct is that they have revoked Acosta\u2019s credentials as a form of content- and viewpoint-based discrimination and in retaliation for Plaintiffs\u2019 exercise of protected First Amendment activity.\u201d\n\nCNN said in its complaint that CEO Jeff Zucker asked White House chief of staff John Kelly to reinstate Acosta's \"hard pass,\" which allows reporters to freely enter and exit the White House compound and travel on Air Force One. Zucker told Kelly that the incident was seen internally as \"part of a 'pattern of targeted harassment'\" against CNN, a favorite target of Trump's in his frequent battles against the news media.\n\nWhite House officials told CNN and Acosta they did not intend to return his credentials, according to the complaint. The complaint also stated that administration officials had denied Acosta access to \u201cdaily passes,\u201d effectively banning him from the White House grounds.\n\nCNN sent Acosta to cover Trump's trip to Paris over the weekend, but the reporter was told he would not be allowed to cover events held by the president, including a planned visit to an American military cemetery that was ultimately canceled. Acosta was granted press credentials by the French government, but the Secret Service still refused him access to Trump's events, according to the complaint.\n\nThe White House Correspondents Association issued a statement Tuesday supporting CNN in challenging the White House.\n\n\u201cRevoking access to the White House complex amounted to disproportionate reaction to the events of last Wednesday. We continue to urge the Administration to reverse course and fully reinstate CNN\u2019s correspondent,\u201d the organization said in a statement. \u201cThe President of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him.\u201d\n\nThe Radio Television Digital News Association and its Voice of the First Amendment Task Force also offered support Tuesday for CNN\u2019s suit.\n\nRTDNA Executive Director Dan Shelley called the Trump administration\u2019s punishment of CNN and Acosta \u201coutrageous and unacceptable\u201d and \u201can unwarranted escalation of anti-First Amendment and press freedom rancor consistently used by this president and his acolytes.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Trump, the suit named Sanders, Kelly, Deputy Chief of Staff Bill Shine and the Secret Service and its director Randolph Alles, as well as the Secret Service agent who revoked Acosta\u2019s pass, listed as a \u201cJohn Doe.\u201d\n\nAmong CNN\u2019s lawyers is Ted Olson, the former solicitor general under George W. Bush known for his role in major Supreme Court cases, including Bush. v. Gore, following the disputed 2000 election, and the overturning of California\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has held in no uncertain terms that the First Amendment protects \u2018robust political debate,\u2019 including \u2018speech that is critical of those who hold public office,\u2019\u201d Olson said in a statement. \u201cMr. Acosta\u2019s press credentials must be restored so that all members of the press know they will remain free to ask tough questions, challenge government officials, and report the business of the nation to the American people.\u201d\n\n", "TRUMP sends fire help after all -- CAMP FIRE becomes deadliest in state history -- How WILDFIRES could play out in SACRAMENTO -- DEMS reclaim state Senate SUPERMAJORITY -- KIM warns of 'foul play' as CISNEROS closes in\n\nTHE BUZZ: There\u2019s a clear pattern in Donald Trump\u2019s reactions when California burns: Ignore what the president says, and watch what the feds do.\n\n-- The public response from Trump often falls along the spectrum from indifferent to hostile: the tweets erroneously blaming California\u2019s management of water and resources, the long online silence as fires were scorching wine country last year, the failure so far to visit fire-ravaged regions. This time he spurred widespread anger for threatening to withhold federal dollars.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n-- But the disaster declaration Gov. Jerry Brown asked for on Sunday arrived 24 hours later, with a more-sympathetic Trump tweet saying he \u201cwanted to respond quickly in order to alleviate some of the incredible suffering going on.\u201d\n\n-- \u201c\u2018The Feds responded quickly to the initial request for federal aid last week,\u2019 said Evan Westrup, a spokesman for Brown. Westrup said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was working closely with the state\u2019s top emergency officials.\n\n-- In general, former FEMA administrators appointed by presidents of both parties said Trump\u2019s personal responses to disasters appeared to have no bearing on the government\u2019s on-the-ground response to them.\u201d Story\n\n-- That isn\u2019t to say that elected officials are thrilled with the response. Trump\u2019s failure to come survey the damage from any of a year\u2019s worth of apocalyptic fires \u2014 even as he visits hurricane victims in other states, devoting his California foray to border-wall prototypes \u2014 continues to be a source of anger. Rep. Jackie Speier said Monday that she has been outraged by Trump\u2019s weekend tweets, saying that he is acting like \u201ca little child\u201d instead of an empathetic leader in responses to the state\u2019s tragedy.\n\n-- Speier told POLITICO she has a direct question to ask him: \u201cPOTUS, you\u2019ve been to Florida. You\u2019ve been to Texas. You\u2019ve been to Georgia. Are you coming here to console people?\u201d Speier says she\u2019s not holding her breath, especially since the president does not have his facts correct with regard to forest management.\n\nBUENOS D\u00cdAS, Good Tuesday morning.

A tweet from the campaign Monday night asserted that a \u201cclear majority\u201d of voters had backed Kim \u2014 who has seen her lead dwindle as the ballot-counting continues \u2014 and warned of potential \u201cfoul play\u201d if the breakdown of votes flowing in seems off.

Cox, another Valadao victory seemed to arrive swiftly: The AP called it for the incumbent a few hours after the polls closed.\n\n-- But as votes keep trickling in, the gap is tightening: As of Tuesday morning, Cox trailed by 2,079 votes, compared to some 5,000 on Election Night (Valadao won by about 18,000 in 2016). Cox never actually conceded this one, and a campaign spox said they still see a path to victory. Team Valadao, which declared victory last week, said the counties still coming in are likely to favor the incumbent: The narrowing gap was \u201cexpected,\u201d but \u201cstatistically, David Valadao has won this race,\u201d spokesman Cole Rojewski said, add.

Trump has regularly demanded that NATO countries increase their defense spending to a higher percentage of their GDP, forcing the issue at last summer's NATO summit by seeming to threaten to pull the U.S. out of the pact if spending targets were not met.\n\nMacron, in his interview, agreed that Europe should become less dependent on the U.S. for its military.\n\nBut just after landing in Paris on Friday, Trump took to Twitter to call Macron\u2019s comments \u201cvery insulting,\u201d adding a new layer of tension to the weekend\u2019s ceremonies, but the two leaders discussed the issue during Trump\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cNever easy bringing up the fact that the U.S. must be treated fairly, which it hasn\u2019t, on both Military and Trade,\u201d Trump tweeted after he returned to the U.S.\n\nTrump, who owns vineyards in the U.S., also hit Macron on Tuesday for what he said were unfair tariffs on wine. \u201cFrance makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S.,\u201d he wrote, claiming that France has tougher barriers and higher tariffs in place for importing U.S. wine than the U.S. has for importing French wine.\n\nThe president also responded to what was perceived to be a dig at Trump\u2019s self-proclaimed nationalism.\n\nSpeaking at an event commemorating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, Macron called nationalism \u201cthe exact opposite of patriotism\u201d in a forceful rebuke to an ideology Trump has supported.\n\nOn Twitter on Tuesday morning, Trump appeared to suggest that Macron\u2019s reading of nationalism was incorrect, writing that \u201cthere is no country more Nationalist than France, very proud people-and rightfully so!\u201d\n\nHe said that Macron was using Trump as a foil to distract from lagging approval ratings and rising unemployment.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%.

Whitaker, who served as Sessions' chief of staff, has spoken critically of Mueller's investigation and is seen as an ally of the president, who has labeled the special counsel's probe a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nSchiff demanded that Whitaker recuse himself from oversight of Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether Trump or his campaign colluded with Russian agents to interfere in the 2016 election, highlighting instances in the past in which Whitaker criticized the probe.\n\nDemocrats have cried foul over what Schiff called Trump\u2019s \u201chandpicking\u201d of Whitaker as Sessions\u2019 replacement to lead the Justice Department on an acting basis. The appointment falls into a legal gray area due to statutory and constitutional guidelines regarding the Justice Department's order of succession and presidential appointments, though the Justice Department is expected to issue a legal opinion in support of Whitaker\u2019s appointment as soon as Tuesday.\n\nSchiff accused the president of installing Whitaker to \u201cprotect himself,\u201d highlighting Whitaker\u2019s ties to the Trump campaign as well as his past statements indicating a skepticism toward the Mueller probe, as grounds for the acting attorney general's recusal.

Andrew Cuomo won a third term, he laid out a list of priorities that could finally pass now that Republicans won\u2019t control the state Senate next year. The first item he mentioned was ethics reform: \u201c[T]here is no reason not to pass it. Legislative jobs should be full time positions with no outside income.\u201d\n\nBut Senate Republicans aren't the only legislators who have blocked Cuomo\u2019s outside income proposal, which would cap the amount of money lawmakers can earn on the side to 15 percent of their base pay: Democrats have also played a large part.\n\nTwo years ago, a commission met to determine whether legislators should get a raise from the $79,500 salary that was set in 1998. And days after top gubernatorial aide Joe Percoco was arrested on corruption charges, Cuomo began saying that legislators shouldn\u2019t receive a salary hike unless they agreed to pass his outside income ban. The end result was a winter of acrimony and no raise. Most of the vitriol came from Assembly Democrats, where members earn less in both state and outside pay than Republicans and are faced with a higher cost-of-living due to their near monopoly on New York City districts. Speaker Carl Heastie dubbed it \u201cwildly inappropriate\u201d to link legislators\u2019 salary to ethics reform, and his appointee to the commissioned said it was \u201cawful that the governor wants to be king.\u201d\n\nA second incarnation of the pay raise commission is scheduled to meet this afternoon; this commission is composed of state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli, city Comptroller Scott Stringer, and CUNY and SUNY chairs Bill Thompson and Carl McCall. This particular conclave is thought to be more amenable toward legislators than the previous version, though there is no guarantee that a raise will be approved. Both Thompson and McCall, notably, were appointed by Cuomo to their current jobs. And DiNapoli has indicated that he agrees with Cuomo\u2019s approach: \u201c[E]liminating or severely limiting outside income, I think, is an issue that should be dealt with in the context of any pay raise consideration,\u201d he said last month.\n\nUnless legislators have become more willing to compromise over the past two years, this leaves Democrats in a bind as they move toward what will essentially be the first policy decision of the new era of one-party rule in Albany. If a pay raise is once again held hostage to outside income, then it\u2019s likely there will once again be gobs of finger-pointing and the new Democratic triumvirate will begin their time together on a bitter note. But if their first order of business is to accept an increase in their own pay while blocking ethics reform, the early narrative of the era of Democratic dominance will be, fairly or not, exactly what Republicans are hoping for. \u2014 Bill Mahoney\n\nIT\u2019S TUESDAY.

The meeting, hosted by George Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations on Nov. 1 and 2, was not publicized and has not been previously reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio has long touted \u201cequity\u201d as the central focus of his administration, but the conference, led by his police commissioner, appears to be the first in-person dialogue on the issue of racial disparity across city government and advocacy groups.

There had been rumblings before last week's election that Flanagan might face an uprising should Republicans lose their majority. Flanagan won his post by an 18-15 conference vote in 2015, thanks in large part to the support of all nine Republicans from Long Island. But there will be only three Republican state senators from Long Island next year, and an overwhelming majority of the conference's members will be from upstate.

The Democratic governor's announcement did not mention the naming of the bridge between Westchester and Rockland counties, now known as the Gov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge.

Now, she's worried her recovering daughter will get sick again when she's scheduled to be sent back on Tuesday to the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation from St. Joseph's University Medical Center in Paterson. \u2026 \u2018Can you guess how much worse she would be if I hadn't told them that she needed to be at a hospital?\u2019 the mother said Friday. \u2018It shouldn't have come down to this.\u2019\u201d Read the report\n\nHQ BOOOOOO \u2014 \u201cAmazon picks Northern Virginia, New York City to split new HQ,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Steven Overly and Gloria Pazmino: Amazon will divide its much-anticipated new headquarters between Crystal City in Northern Virginia and Long Island City in Queens, New York, a source with knowledge of the plan confirmed to POLITICO on Monday night. The move follows a search that spanned more than a year and prompted local governments across North America to scramble to offer tax breaks and other incentives to win the company's favor.

Chris Christie if he\u2019s nominated to become the next U.S. attorney general. In 2016, the Christie administration paid a $1.5 million settlement to a former assistant county prosecutor who claimed the administration took over his office and fired him, all with the aim of dismissing the office\u2019s 43-count indictment against several of the governor\u2019s allies that embarrassed one of Christie\u2019s major contributors. That whistleblower, Bennett Barlyn, told POLITICO on Monday that he has grave concerns about Christie becoming the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official, and his case could take on new relevance, with the next attorney general poised to take over the department that oversees the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. Barlyn said that if Christie is nominated, the Senate should look at this case as just one way the former governor wielded justice, both as governor and U.S. attorney, for political ends.

New Jerseyans just re-elected a senator with upside-down approvals of 36%-52%. Booker\u2019s approvals are at 58%-37% .... Sometimes parties look to a stalwart with some gravitas to go on the ticket to add some credibility. In 2008, some GOP leaders practically begged former Rep. Dick Zimmer to take on Frank Lautenberg, so they wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed. Democrats did the same thing when they got former Rep. Paul Krebs to run against Clifford Case in 1972.

Berlinski said his views align more closely with Republican MacArthur than Kim. Berlinski ran as a Constitution Party candidate and he said he believes the federal government has grown beyond the boundaries prescribed by the U.S. Constitution. Berlinski's focus was on shrinking the federal government. Berlinski said he's `been getting a couple of jabs\u2018 by detractors since the election. But it's unclear whether \u2014 if Berlinski didn't run \u2014 Berlinski's 3,845 votes would have gone to MacArthur to put him in the lead. In the latest count as of Monday afternoon, MacArthur has 146,978 votes to Kim's 150,405.

So they travel into New Jersey. Some drive across bridges, or through tunnels. Some take a PATH train under the Hudson River from New York City into Jersey City or Hoboken.

Crystal City in Arlington County, Va., and New York City\u2019s Queens borough will share the HQ2 role, according to various reports. Look for the official decision today.\n\nThe 14-month search for a second HQ (the first is in Seattle) prompted familiar debates in Chicago about corporate tax breaks. But still, Chicago seemed a perfect fit for Amazon. The city can accommodate the size of the project, can offer up transportation and housing with ease, and it has the talent. Those were all on Bezos\u2019 wish list. The city\u2019s progressive politics also seemed right for the Amazon CEO. In the end, though, it wasn\u2019t about about political personality. It was just business. Cue Frankie Valli .\n\nMORE BUZZ\n\nThe decision to close two Target stores on the South Side is shaping up to be a big issue in the mayor\u2019s race\u2014or as Gery Chico said Monday, \u201cIt\u2019s the issue.\u201d Big companies \u201ccan\u2019t just cut and run\u201d because they\u2019re underperforming, he told protesters organized by Congressman Bobby Rush. \u201cWe can\u2019t have economic development blowing up on the city\u2019s north side and not the south side.\u201d\n\nChico joins a chorus of mayoral candidates hitting on the issue. Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle wrote a letter to the Sun-Times calling Target\u2019s decision \u201cdisappointing and regrettable.\u201d Businessman Bill Daley applauded the City Council for pulling tax-increment financing for a Target investment on the city\u2019s North Side. And activist Amara Enyia says the city should create a special incentive program for local ownership by residents who live in or near the community.\n\nThe Minneapolis-based retailer blames poor performance for the closures in the Morgan Park and Chatham neighborhoods. Other retailers say they\u2019re experiencing the same thing. They cite a combination of challenges: increased sales tax, a $14 minimum wage, property-tax hikes, licensing fees going up, hikes in tobacco, liquor and sales taxes and the move to require every employer to provide at least some paid sick leave.\n\nAlso at issue (and it\u2019s big): charging shoplifters with misdemeanors instead of felonies. That began two years ago when Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx ordered prosecutors to lower charge for shoplifters unless the value of the stolen goods exceeds $1,000 or the alleged shoplifter has 10 prior felony convictions. Retailers say they're feeling the effects of that decision as shoplifting is on the rise.\n\nThere was a time retailers were willing to subsidize underperforming stores for the good of a community. Shareholders these days just don\u2019t have the patience.\n\nRob Karr, president and CEO of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association says economic development is the \u201cbiggest issue\u201d facing retailers in Chicago. \u201cWe have been warning for years that the focus of the city has been the loop and city center and that neighborhoods are suffering.\u201d Target\u2019s closure \u201cis a symptom of a bigger problem.\u201d\n\nWelcome to POLITICO\u2019s Illinois Playbook.

(Disclosure: I worked for the Gazette as an intern, reporter and freelancer from 2016 to 2017).\n\nThe Gazette is one of several newspapers that have recently opted to unionize. The Los Angeles Times voted to unionize in January, and the Chicago Tribune's employee union was recognized by Tribune Publishing, then known as Tronc, in May. The New Yorker staff unionized in June.\n\n\"The cue we took from them is seeing that this is possible and seeing this is a way, really, for those who write the news and print the news and distribute the news and sell ads for the news to have a say in how their news organizations are run in a time where there is an uncertain future,\" Gazette reporter Dusty Christensen told me. Closer to home, the Boston Globe's employee union represents some 600 employees.\n\nThis reemergence of organized labor comes as public sector unions took a hit this summer when the Supreme Court issued its Janus v. AFSCME ruling. If NNE does not voluntarily recognize the union, the 72-person group will request ballots for a company-wide election from the National Union Relations Board, an independent federal agency.\n\nThe Gazette and Advocate employees started organizing last year around gender pay disparity, which came to a head when the paper's then-executive editor Jeff Good publicly said he was fired for advocating for equal pay, although the publisher and some former staffers dispute that claim. Since then, publisher Michael Rifanburg announced several staff cuts and the company folded the Advocate into the Gazette's features department, saying the paper is \"feeling the pinch\" of a decline in print readership and a tariff on Canadian newsprint. The Gazette also named Brooke Hauser editor in chief in August.\n\n\"Hopefully they'll let the process unfold in a democratic way,\" state Rep. Jim O'Day, a vocal union supporter, told me on Monday night. \"I think whenever workers can come together \u2026 Whether it's for better working conditions, greater wages, better hours, you name it, I think that is beneficial to those workers and to their families.\"\n\nThe Pioneer Valley NewsGuild consulted with the national NewsGuild-CWA.

Can Democratic leadership cut any deal with President Donald Trump in the midst of a battle for speaker of the House? Can Democrats have their fingerprints on any deal that results in a border wall?

Push her out, and men may take over the party at a time when more than 100 women are heading to Capitol Hill and after women voters have been thoroughly alienated by President Donald Trump. Embrace her, and she\u2019ll prioritize legislation empowering women from equal pay to anti-harassment legislation.\n\n\u201c\u2018I think it would look ridiculous if we win back the House \u2026 we have a pink wave with women who have brought back the House, then you\u2019re going to not elect the leader who led the way?

Though McSally led narrowly on Election Night, Sinema took the lead in the race two days later and continued to pad her edge as the state counted outstanding votes through the weekend and Monday.\n\n-- THE CONTEXT: \u201cSinema\u2019s victory gives Democrats their second pickup of the election, and limits Republican gains in the chamber to just one seat so far, pending a recount in Florida and a runoff in Mississippi.

He bluntly stated that no matter how much progress they made, they must remain so. He openly called critics disloyal, even treasonous. He liberally threw insults like candy during public speeches. He rudely ignored answers he didn\u2019t like. He regularly put other people into positions they didn\u2019t want to be in, then blamed them when things went sour. His own bodyguard later called him \u201cdestined to conflict,\u201d a man who \u201cfound it impossible to conciliate or temporize.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut the nation\u2019s politicians simply had to interact with Andrew Johnson, for he had become the legitimate, constitutionally ordained chief executive upon Abraham Lincoln\u2019s death by assassination.\n\nTheir path for managing this choleric man reveals that a president need not be kicked out of office to be removed from holding a firm grip on the reins of power. It also shows that people around the president, from Congress to the Cabinet, have many more tools at their disposal than, say, writing an anonymous New York Times op-ed to stop a leader they consider reckless or dangerous.\n\nThis is true even though Johnson\u2019s vice presidency remains historically unique. For his 1864 reelection bid, Lincoln had dumped his first-term vice president, Hannibal Hamlin. To appeal to non-Republicans and show he wasn\u2019t just a Northern leader in the middle of the Civil War, the president instead ran on a new \u201cNational Union\u201d ticket. He picked Johnson, a lifelong Democrat from Tennessee who had been the only senator out of 11 Southern states to remain with the Union in 1861 instead of walking out of the Senate and leaving a vacant seat in protest.\n\nBut Johnson turned out to be a poor choice, and the new vice president couldn\u2019t have started his term much worse. Feeling ill, Johnson threw down three glasses of whiskey right before his swearing-in ceremony and inaugural speech. \u201cI need all the strength I can get,\u201d he told Hamlin, who was there to hand off the office Johnson would soon assume.\n\nThe audience noticed, and not just because Johnson\u2019s face had turned bright red and his planned five-minute address stretched to three times longer. Shouting, gesticulating wildly, stumbling over his words and shaking his fists, he went into stump-speech mode, declaring violently that he was a man of the people and that Tennessee had never left the Union. Hamlin tried to shut him up and pull him away but failed in both. Johnson stammered and had to ask assembled officials nearby who the secretary of the Navy was. During the spectacle, the attorney general leaned over and called it \u201ca wretched mess\u201d to Gideon Welles\u2014who happened to be the secretary of the Navy\u2014who in turn said, \u201cJohnson is either drunk or crazy.\u201d\n\nJohnson finally stopped his meandering and allowed Hamlin to administer the oath of office. Unfortunately, he bungled that, too, stumbling through the words and adding his own befuddled commentary along the way. After putting his lips to the Bible he\u2019d just sworn on and yelling, \u201cI kiss this Book in the face of my nation of the United States!\u201d officials moved him on and asked someone else, on his behalf, to perform the new vice president\u2019s traditional duty and administer oaths to the new senators. Lincoln took it all in stride, denying that his new vice president was a drunkard while acknowledging his \u201cbad slip.\u201d Johnson did the noble thing and kept himself mostly out of the public eye for the next 10 days to let the scandal subside.\n\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

Johnson thus started his time in office without a strong sense of exactly how Lincoln planned to ensure the final surrender of all Confederate forces in the Civil War and rebuild the war-torn nation.\n\nAlthough Congress had already put in place some features of the post-war period that would serve as flash points with the new administration\u2014like the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau, charged primarily with feeding and caring for former slaves\u2014Johnson came to the top job with a very different conception of post-war reunification. He questioned the federal government\u2019s right to do much of anything in the formerly rebellious states until they had representatives back in Congress, even if those officials were former Confederates. His vision, of course, clashed with the so-called Radical Republicans in Congress, intent on reconstructing the South from Washington in order to guarantee the freedoms of those who had been enslaved for so long.\n\nJohnson rankled most legislators, and the vast majority of Northerners, almost immediately. He released leading members of the Confederate Cabinet from government custody, up to and including the former Confederate vice president, Alexander H. Stephens. He appointed governors in Southern states and allowed their legislatures to meet. Dominated by secessionists, these governments passed \u201cblack codes,\u201d allowing slavery in all but name to continue in many areas.\n\nJohnson also made his racist views clear in statements like this one to the federal commissioner of the Public Buildings Service: \u201cEveryone would, and must admit, that the white race was superior to the black, and that while we ought to do our best to bring them . . . up to our present level, that, in doing so, we should, at the same time raise our own intellectual status so that the relative position of the two races would be the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there no way,\u201d declared leading radical senator Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania just months after Johnson\u2019s inauguration, \u201cto arrest the insane course of the president in Washington?\u201d He even mused that by taking actions more properly lying with Congress\u2014like treating southern states as legitimate entities, even as most legislators considered them still occupied territory\u2014the new president was setting the stage to be \u201ccrowned king.\u201d Leading legislators urged the president to call Congress into a special session, or at least delay controversial moves until it was scheduled to convene in December. Johnson obstinately ignored them. By the winter of 1865\u20131866, the president had proved himself \u201calready more disposed to be the political partisan of the Southerners than the ally of those who had elected him,\u201d according to Adam Badeau, a confidant of Army General Ulysses Grant.\n\nThis stubbornness and refusal to cooperate with even moderate Republicans escalated once Congress came back into session in December of 1865, still without Southern representation and still dominated by Republicans steadfastly opposed to the leniency the new president was offering to the former Confederate states. Johnson vetoed both a civil rights bill designed to fight back the dreaded black codes and another measure to expand the functions of the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau. His message to Congress about the latter veto included condescending language, like urging legislators to take \u201cmore mature considerations.\u201d The vetoes enraged Capitol Hill, especially the author of the bills, to whom Johnson had raised no objections when he\u2019d sought the president\u2019s opinions during the drafting process.\n\nThe legislative branch, as a consequence, did something that was then unprecedented in American history on a major piece of legislation: They overturned a presidential veto. Then they did it again. Ultimately, they turned back the president\u2019s rejections of bills a stunning 15 times\u2014a record to this day, even though Johnson served a shorter term than most presidents. The Civil Rights Act\u2019s veto override in the House prompted a spontaneous outburst of applause among both representatives and spectators; the speaker found it impossible to restore order for several minutes.\n\nAlso in early 1866, a congressional Joint Committee on Reconstruction developed a constitutional amendment, which presidents have no power to either approve or deny. It sought to prohibit states from depriving citizens of fundamental rights or equal protection under the law and to rescind the constitutional formula by which states had gained the benefit of additional representation in Congress for slaves within their borders, without letting those slaves vote. Both houses of Congress passed it in June, but behind the scenes Johnson obstructed its ratification. The measure would ultimately become the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868.\n\nThe president also saw his judicial appointment powers curtailed. When a Supreme Court vacancy came up, Congress eliminated the seat rather than confirm Johnson\u2019s nominee. As a hedge against a potential future Johnson appointment, they went ahead and legislated in advance that the next high court vacancy, too, would not require filling.\n\nIn August and September of 1866, Johnson tried to rally public support around him in a multistate 19-day road trip, during which he gave more than 100 speeches. Typically frosty audiences greeted the president, often drawing him into unseemly shouting matches or forcing him to cut short his visit. In Bloomington, Illinois, one heckler yelled that traitors weren\u2019t welcome in the land of Lincoln; the ensuing uproar made it impossible for Johnson to complete his planned speech.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in the history of our country,\u201d wrote the New York Independent, \u201cthe people have been witness to the mortifying spectacle of the president going from town to town, accompanied by the prominent members of the Cabinet, on an electioneering raid, denouncing his opponents, bandying epithets with men in the crowd, and praising himself and his policies. Such a humiliating exhibition has never before been seen, nor anything even approaching to it.\u201d\n\nPushback wasn\u2019t just coming from Congress and rally crowds. From summer 1866 on, both General Grant and War Secretary Edwin Stanton were resisting\u2014often all but openly defying\u2014Johnson\u2019s orders from within the executive branch.\n\nThe president had declared the Southern rebellion over in 1866, seemingly ending the army\u2019s primacy over local law enforcement there. But Grant later sent confidential instructions that commanders should continue martial law as needed and resist any presidential attempt to curtail the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau\u2019s actions. In October, Grant twice refused Johnson\u2019s request that he join a diplomatic delegation to Mexico\u2014the president\u2019s ploy to get the war hero out of the way. Then, in a full Cabinet meeting, Johnson pretended that Grant had never objected to going to Mexico by having the secretary of state read to the general detailed instructions for the diplomatic mission. When Johnson condescendingly asked the attorney general to lecture Grant on the duty to obey presidential orders, the general stood and declared, \u201cI am an American citizen, and eligible to any office to which any American is eligible. I am an officer of the Army, and bound to obey your military orders. But this is a civil office, a purely diplomatic duty that you offer me, and I cannot be compelled to undertake it. \u2026 No power on Earth can compel me to do it.\u201d\n\nGrant feared being away from Washington if, as he thought increasingly likely, the beleaguered president were to decide that disbanding Congress and using force to take total control of the government offered him the best way through the impasse. Badeau recorded that the general, while looking to the general public like a faithful follower of Johnson and his policies, \u201cwas in reality doing more than all the country besides to thwart Johnson\u2019s designs.\u201d\n\nStanton, despite his steadfast opposition to the president\u2019s approach, stubbornly remained in Johnson\u2019s Cabinet because he felt he could delay or even prevent some of Johnson\u2019s worst actions. The secretary favored Reconstruction legislation in early 1867 that provided for military government in the South, which was passed over the president\u2019s veto. He watched as successive bills from Capitol Hill received presidential vetoes, but became law anyway over Johnson\u2019s objections. \u201cThe situation was unprecedented in the history of the country,\u201d wrote Badeau. \u201cA Cabinet Minister and the General of the Army were doing their utmost to thwart the President. . . . They then more than once discussed the means by which they too could apparently obey the directions of a superior and yet neutralize his intent and purpose.\u201d\n\nParticularly distressing to Grant, Stanton and many others around them was the increasing violence in the South between emboldened former Confederates and former slaves asserting their rights. Already by the end of 1866, the president \u201cbecame, if not treasonable in intent, yet unpatriotic in action,\u201d Badeau noted, probably representing Grant\u2019s views. \u201cHe fostered a spirit that engendered massacre, and afterward protected the evil-doers. He spoke, both with Grant in private and openly to the public, as if the Congress elected by the faithful States was an illegal body. He suggested to men\u2019s minds that he might be plotting to allow the Southerners to return to their places in spite of the North.\u201d\n\nJohnson faced a dilemma. He couldn\u2019t easily get rid of Grant, the most popular living American, who had won respect even from Southerners for his gracious treatment of Robert E. Lee after the Confederate general\u2019s surrender at Appomattox Court House in 1865. Plus, Congress wrote language into the military appropriations bill for 1867-1868 that both denied the president\u2019s right to directly control the military\u2014all orders had to go through the general of the army (Grant)\u2014and prevented Grant\u2019s demotion without the Senate\u2019s consent. Stanton also gained protection from Congress in the form of the Tenure of Office Act of February 1867, a constitutionally unsound measure that nevertheless prohibited presidential removal of certain executive branch officers, including Stanton, unless the Senate agreed.\n\nJohnson\u2019s veto of the Tenure of Office Act got the usual treatment from Congress: a prompt override. \u201cHe is of no account,\u201d one senator said bluntly. \u201cWe pay no attention anymore to what he says.\u201d Virginia\u2019s Republican governor wrote to a prominent congressman, \u201cI fear there will be no peace in the country as long as Johnson is in the Presidential Chair.\u201d Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles reported in June 1867 that the president was \u201cnervous and apprehensive,\u201d all but trapped in the White House \u201cin constant dread of impeachment.\u201d\n\nBut Johnson just couldn\u2019t leave things well enough alone.\n\nAfter suspending Stanton until Congress reconvened, the president ended up firing his war secretary outright in February 1868. Stanton refused to leave his office\u2014literally moving in and hunkering down, day and night, for the duration of the crisis\u2014giving representatives the excuse they\u2019d been hoping for to try to kick the president out of office. Johnson that same month became the first president to be impeached by the House.\n\nThe failure of the Radical Republicans to convict him in the Senate (by one vote) and thus remove him from office didn\u2019t stop Congress from keeping Johnson boxed in. He remained something short of a full chief executive during his final 10 months in office, with effective restrictions on his power, like the Tenure of Office Act, locked in. General Grant, by this time a candidate for the presidential election that November, believed that \u201cJohnson had been taught a lesson which he would not forget.\u201d Johnson\u2019s leading biographer Hans Trefousse calls him, for the remainder of his time as chief executive, a \u201cpresident in limbo.\u201d\n\nBefore the trial, Congress had passed a new Reconstruction bill, which became law when Johnson didn\u2019t even bother to veto it. He did, however, issue a veto against a bill denying appeal rights in some cases, but Congress overrode that. Legislators in June also rejected new presidential vetoes, on the very days they were issued, against bills readmitting several Southern states with new constitutions. The following month it happened again on bills excluding electoral votes of states that had not yet been reorganized and extending the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau another year.\n\n\u201cSomehow I expected that there would be a change in Mr. Johnson\u2019s position after his victory over the Radicals,\u201d wrote the president\u2019s bodyguard, William Crook, who had an inside view of the whole situation. \u201cIf I had thought of it, I might have realized that the two-thirds majority was still against him. The only difference was that when they passed measures over the President\u2019s veto it was without debate. There was no longer the need for discussion.\u201d\n\nSenators also turned down Johnson\u2019s nominees for lesser diplomatic posts so often that, exasperated, he announced he would only put forward a prospective nominee able to prove to him in advance that confirmation would come.\n\nOne power he still held was that of the federal pardon. And pardon he did, issuing many more of them than all other presidents to that point, combined\u2014overwhelmingly for those who participated in the rebellion against the Union. Johnson even pardoned a few of the men convicted in the conspiracy to kill President Lincoln. He anticipated his old party would show some appreciation for the pain he had caused to Republicans by giving him the presidential spot on the Democratic ticket for the coming election against Grant. The party convention dashed those hopes by instead choosing Horatio Seymour, a man who didn\u2019t even want the nomination.\n\nWhy wait until the end of a term to remove a president? Methods ranging from the deft to the downright unsavory have undermined presidents\u2019 authority, seen so clearly in Andrew Johnson\u2019s case. Most of the same mechanisms used to undermine him remain in others\u2019 toolkits today, which means it\u2019s equally true now as it was under Johnson: You don\u2019t have to formally eject an unpopular or unfit president from the White House if you can use various other means to limit the damage he is causing to the country.\n\nExcerpted from How To Get Rid of a President by David Priess.

How they did that is the story of the 2018 election. One defining characteristic of 2018 was the split between voters most concerned about health care and those most concerned about immigration. The partisan breakdown on those issues was a mirror image: Among \u201chealth care\u201d voters, 75 percent voted Democratic and 23 percent went Republican; for \u201cimmigration\u201d voters, 75 percent voted Republican and 23 percent went Democratic. That was evident both in polling and on-the-ground reporting in Wisconsin by Politico Magazine last week.

He demurs when asked about his own politics. \u201cBut I can tell you what people say.\u201d\n\nOne of Gary\u2019s regulars is Willy Ellertson, a 55-year-old cardiac lab technician who volunteers on weekends as an emergency responder for the Wind Lake Fire Department. A Republican, he\u2019s glad that Trump is in the White House, and says that people in these parts are happy \u201cbecause of promises that he made that they are hoping change things.\u201d Ellertson wants Obamacare repealed and replaced. Yet he\u2019s troubled by aspects of the alternative offered by congressional Republicans. \u201cI\u2019m on the same page as everybody else in thinking that pre-existing conditions need to be covered,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I do think it could affect how people vote for Congress.\u201d\n\nGary Bebler, owner of Gary's Wind Lake Boathouse, a small but popular restaurant and bar, handles most of the kitchen and floor duties on Monday nights, his chef's night off. | Patrick Cavan Brown for Politico Magazine\n\nThe top concern for other regulars is what they see as the changing identity of America. At the bar, Tony Fischer, a 71-year-old veteran and retiree, sips from a bottle of beer. \u201cOur country needs to be saved from itself,\u201d he said when asked about his beliefs. \u201cWe should be one people, of one faith, of one country.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a refrain Bebler hears constantly: America doesn\u2019t look like it used to. My health care is too expensive and doesn\u2019t cover my needs.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSometimes, the two gripes are married. Bebler said the main story he hears from patrons, over and over, is about people who don\u2019t have insurance but who receive free care at the emergency room. Bebler, who doesn\u2019t have health insurance, bristles at the thought. \u201cI\u2019d never do it in a million years,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a matter of pride and dignity.\n\nIt\u2019s a sentiment shared by his clientele, according to Bebler, and something many of them see as distinguishing themselves from immigrants and people of color. While \u201cpeople who don\u2019t have any money and really need government help\u201d don\u2019t accept handouts, Bebler said, channeling his customers, \u201ctoo many minorities take advantage of stuff that they shouldn\u2019t be able to take advantage of.

It\u2019s not a political wave that ebbs and flows every few years, but a demographic wave that, for the past quarter-century, has gained strength. It\u2019s not red or blue, but a gray wave.\n\nIn 1994, exit polls by Edison Research show that voters over age 45 made up just 55 percent of the electorate in House races. But in each of the three most recent midterm cycles\u20142010, 2014 and 2018\u2014Americans in that same age bracket have made up roughly two-thirds of the national electorate. Sixty-five percent of voters in 2018 House races were over 45, according to the national exit poll; 56 percent were over 50, compared with 46 percent in 2016.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 resounding victories in House races from coast to coast\u2014nationwide, the party won the popular vote for the House by a 6.7 percent margin, as of late Monday\u2014were driven by a marked improvement among all segments of the electorate. But because older voters made up a larger share of the electorate in this year\u2019s midterms, Democrats\u2019 stronger performance with this cohort was critical to their success.\n\nNew Window Wisconsin's Deciders In Their Own Words: We asked seniors in Milwaukee\u2014one of the most racially segregated and politically polarized cities in the nation\u2014what they want the next Congress to do. Here\u2019s what they told us. (CLICK TO OPEN) | Patrick Cavan Brown for Politico Magazine\n\nExit polls from 2016 suggest that in the 2016 House vote, Republicans defeated Democrats 54 percent to 44 percent among voters age 50\u201364, and by 53 percent to 45 percent among voters 65 and older. But this year, older voters were split almost evenly between the parties. Republicans carried voters in the 50\u201364 bracket by just 1 point, 50 percent to 49 percent\u2014well within the margin of error for the exit poll, which was conducted for the National Election Pool by Edison Research. The results for voters 65 and older was nearly identical: 50 percent for Republicans and 48 percent for Democrats.\n\nNationally, Democrats won in 2018 because when it came to \u201cthe deciders\u201d\u2014those Americans age 50 and up\u2014they fought Republicans to a draw.\n\nAnd how they did that is the story of this election.\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe main reason for Democrats\u2019 electoral success this year with older Americans is that in 2018, Democratic candidates stopped seeing health care as a liability and began seeing it as a political weapon.\n\nAn analysis of House and Senate campaign ads by the Wesleyan Media Project found that from Sept. 18 to Oct. 15, 2018, a full 54.5 percent of all ads for Democratic House and Senate candidates discussed health care, while only 31.5 percent of pro-Republican ads did the same. It\u2019s a striking reversal from the four election cycles since the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act\u2014four elections in which no more than 10 percent of Democratic ads mentioned health care and during which Republicans were several times more likely to discuss the issue.\n\nHealth care was the single-most-discussed issue in political ads in 2018. Of the more than 3 million election ads that ran on TV this cycle, at least 1.2 million mentioned health care, according to an analysis by Bloomberg News based on data from Kantar Media/CMAG. Nearly three-fourths of those ads were paid for by Democrats and Democratic-aligned groups. And many of those were aimed squarely at voters over 50\u2014and weren\u2019t particularly subtle about that fact.\n\nIn western Houston, Democratic challenger Lizzie Fletcher hit Republican incumbent John Culberson for voting to repeal the ACA, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, which has boomed in popularity since its passage in 2010. \u201cThe health care system is broken,\u201d Fletcher said in a TV ad while walking in a large cement lot. \u201cCongress could help fix it, but John Culberson is taking a wrecking ball to it,\u201d she says as a large wrecking ball smashes through a cinderblock wall painted with the words \u201cpeople 50 and over.\u201d Fletcher won her race, flipping a House seat.\n\nTop: At the polling place in a fire station in Burlington, Wisconsin, these red, white and blue cloth-curtained voting booths have been in service for more than 40 years.

In races from upstate New York to the Arizona-Mexico border to Cedar Rapids, Iowa to the suburbs of Richmond, Va., Democratic challengers flipped GOP-held House seats while running ads accusing Republicans of supporting this so-called Age Tax, using a term popularized by the political arm of the AARP. (AARP underwrites POLITICO Magazine\u2019s reported series, \u201cThe Deciders.\u201d)\n\nWith health care front and center in the election, Republicans scrambled to respond, before deciding to return fire on the issue in ads that were aimed at seniors and alleged that Democrats plan to \u201cend Medicare as we know it\u201d by supporting the \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d proposal backed by liberal stalwarts including Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nIn an onslaught of TV spots paid for by the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC closely aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, Democratic challengers throughout the nation were accused of supporting a \u201cradical\u201d \u201csingle-payer socialist plan\u201d that would \u201cend Medicare as we know it,\u201d \u201ckick you off your health care plan, causing doctor shortages,\u201d and \u201cnearly double the debt.\u201d\n\nNationally, Republicans\u2019 attempts to parry the health care attacks failed to close the gap between the two parties on the issue. In a postelection POLITICO/Morning Consult survey, significantly more voters said they trusted Democrats in Congress more on health care, 48 percent, than they trusted Republicans, 35 percent.\n\nEffectively tying Republicans among older voters allowed Democrats to exploit their long-held advantages with younger voters\u2014leads that were larger than in recent elections, too. Democrats carried voters age 18 to 29 by 35 percentage points, voters in their 30s by 22 points and voters in their 40s by 6 points.\n\nBut where the senior vote was lopsided, not even overwhelming support from younger voters was enough to save Democratic candidates. The marquee pickups by Republicans last week\u2014including the three Republicans who toppled Democratic incumbents in Senate races\u2014were all instances in which Democrats were unable to match the GOP among older voters.\n\nTop: A Friday night fish fry at a local supper club brings an early crowd.

Kevin Cramer knocked off Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in large part because of a 22-point lead among voters age 50 to 64. The two candidates actually split voters 65 and older\u2014perhaps a vestige of the state\u2019s long history of electing Democratic senators, like Quentin Burdick, Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan before Heitkamp.\n\nIt was the same in Indiana, where Republican Mike Braun, a former state representative, won 56 percent of voters 50 and older\u2014crucial to his resounding victory over Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, in which Braun received 52 percent of the overall vote.\n\nIn Missouri, Republican state Attorney General Josh Hawley won voters age 50\u201364 by 13 points, and voters 65 and older by 9 points, en route to an overall 6-point victory against Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent.\n\nFor a few Republican candidates, winning older voters was not enough to secure a victory. Nevada\u2019s Dean Heller, the one incumbent Republican senator running for reelection in a state Hillary Clinton carried in 2016, won voters 50 and older by a roughly 15-point margin. But Nevada\u2019s broader electorate was skewed young: Half of all voters were younger than 50\u2014about 5 points higher than the nation overall, and higher still than the states where Republicans wrested away Senate seats from Democrats.\n\nTop, left: Milwaukee, a city whose baseball team is called the Brewers, is known for its beer brewing.

If Gov. Rick Scott does unseat Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, it will be largely on the back of older voters, who made up two-thirds of the electorate in Florida and went for Scott by roughly 10 points. In Arizona, Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema edged Republican Congresswoman Martha McSally and flipped a Senate seat by fighting to a statistical 50-50 tie among voters 65 and older, while running up a 19-point majority among voters ages 18\u201344, according to exit polls.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans mounted only token challenges to Democratic incumbents in Ohio and Pennsylvania\u2014running against poorly funded, lackluster GOP nominees\u2014 despite Trump\u2019s victory in both states during the 2016 presidential election. Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania both carried voters 50 and older in their races; Brown by talking about pocketbook issues like pensions that were important to union voters, and Casey by pledging his willingness to work across the aisle while slowly piling up legislative achievements ranging from ensuring the U.S. military uses American steel for armor plates to providing support for families hit hard by opioid addiction.\n\nIn polls conducted earlier this year for \u201cThe Deciders\u201d series, voters 50 and older in each of the four states chose health care, Medicare and Social Security as their top issues\u2014and the salience of these issues was confirmed by last week\u2019s exit polls. In the Edison Research exit poll, 41 percent of voters cited health care as the most important issue facing the country. In second place was immigration, the top concern for 23 percent of voters. And the partisan breakdown on those issues was a mirror image: Among \u201chealth care\u201d voters, 75 percent voted Democratic and 23 percent went Republican; for \u201cimmigration\u201d voters, 75 percent voted Republican and 23 percent went Democratic.\n\nLast Tuesday, outside polling places throughout Wisconsin\u2014another key battleground state with high-profile statewide races\u2014voters reflected that partisan breakdown.\n\nTop: An attendee of Scott Walker\u2019s Election Night campaign party shows off his Trump-supporting t-shirt.

But statewide, Democrats bounced back from their 2016 losses. Sen. Tammy Baldwin won reelection easily, and state schools superintendent Tony Evers narrowly unseated Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who was running for a third term. The Evers-Walker race marked a break from a trend in Democratic victories this cycle: Walker decisively carried voters ages 50\u201364 by 7 points, and voters 65 and older by 11 points, but it wasn\u2019t enough to overcome Evers\u2019 double-digit margins with every age bracket under 50.\n\nEven so, it was in keeping with another defining characteristic of 2018: the split between voters most concerned about health care and those most concerned about immigration. In exit polls, 46 percent of Wisconsin voters identified health care as the most important issue in the election; Evers won 73 percent of their votes. Twenty percent cited immigration as the top issue; Walker won their support by 41 points.\n\nOn election night, as Republican die-hards gathered for a watch party at the Ingleside Hotel in Pewaukee, hopes were high that the GOP could hold the governor\u2019s seat and maybe even the U.S. House.\n\n\u201cI like what Trump\u2019s doing,\u201d said Gerry Kruschka, a 62-year-old Republican who owns Wild Wings Sportsmen\u2019s Club, a hunting facility about an hour north of Milwaukee. \u201cI wish more people would get on the Trump bandwagon and start pushing stuff through.

Bill Nelson wants to \u201csteal the election.\u201d He urged state police to investigate the possibility of \u201crampant voter fraud,\u201d for which he provided no evidence and for which no proof has been found by authorities, including a judge who said Monday that both sides should \u201cramp down the rhetoric.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDeSantis, the former congressman who ran to succeed the term-limited Scott, took the opposite tack. DeSantis has limited his public comments, called for unity and refrained from mentioning theft or fraud, instead imploring that \u201ceveryone involved in the election process strictly adhere to the rule of law which is the foundation for our nation.\u201d\n\nThe divergent approaches of the two Republicans to the unfolding controversy gives a glimpse into the new political roles they\u2019re likely to fill in January. Scott, who campaigned as more of a centrist, now sounds the part of the conservative Washington partisan inveighing against liberals and holding the line for President Donald Trump. DeSantis, preparing to take the reins of government in Tallahassee from Scott, is moderating his tone and leaving behind some of the rhetoric that characterizes today\u2019s Trump Republican.\n\nDeSantis was derisively nicknamed a \u201cmini-Trump\u201d during the campaign as Scott kept a measure of distance from the president. But now it\u2019s Scott who sounds like the president. Or it\u2019s the president who sounds like Scott.\n\nOn Monday, Trump continued to push the voter fraud allegations, essentially calling on the state to halt the legally required recounts in both the Senate and gubernatorial races.\n\n\u201cThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,\u201d Trump said on Twitter, failing to provide any evidence for his claims of absent or fraudulent ballots. \u201cAn honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s campaign refused to give any response to Trump\u2019s latest call.\n\nDeSantis, without directly rebuking Trump\u2019s remarks, did not call on the recount to be halted. Privately, some some of his top supporters fretted that Scott and Trump are undermining faith in the very election system that Scott oversees and that DeSantis will likely control once the recount is done and he assumes office.\n\n\u201cThese guys are going full crazy and there\u2019s no need,\u201d said one DeSantis insider. \u201cIt\u2019s utterly unhelpful and pointless. We\u2019re going to win. So why do this?\u201d\n\nIn a written statement to POLITICO, DeSantis said he shares the \u201cfrustration\u201d with the slow process of counting and recounting votes in Broward and Palm Beach counties and chided their election supervisors.\n\nIn Broward, regular post-election updates weren\u2019t given by Supervisor Brenda Snipes, who was successfully sued by Scott for failing to provide public records concerning the ballots she had left to count. She also accepted 22 votes cast by absentee ballot that should not have been accepted because of a voter signature mismatch. In Palm Beach County, Supervisor Susan Bucher was successfully sued by Scott over duplicating about 650 damaged ballots outside of public view.\n\n\u201cThe rule of law is foundational to our society and it must be followed. As governor, I will work diligently with our legislative leaders to make sure that all Floridians have continued confidence in our election system and that we address the potential deficiencies that have caused this situation in a few counties,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cA crisis of faith in our election system should not be allowed to fester based on the actions of a few supervisors and I will work to right this situation for future elections.\u201d\n\nDeSantis\u2019 measured tone is an extension of his comments made Saturday after the state\u2019s 67 election supervisors submitted their first wave of unofficial results, triggering the recounts in his race, Scott\u2019s contest and the battle for Florida agriculture commissioner.\n\nIn a video address, DeSantis \u2014 flanked by Florida and U.S. flags as he sat behind a desk \u2014 called the election results \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d and reiterated that he won. However, he did not call for an end to the recount, took no shots at political opponents and spoke of the need for Floridians to unite.\n\n\u201cWith the election behind us, it\u2019s now time to come together as a state as we prepare to serve all Floridians,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cSince Tuesday night, that is what I have been doing, and that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead as I prepare to take office as the 46th governor of the state of Florida.\u201d\n\nThe concept, according to DeSantis' team, is to make the former congressman look above the fray \u2014 \"a statesman.\"\n\nIn contrast, two days earlier, Scott\u2019s campaign promoted a news conference at the Governor\u2019s Mansion where he struck a strident, conspiratorial tone as he called on the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate voting in South Florida and promised that he \u201cwill not sit idly by while unethical liberals try to steal this election from the people of Florida.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day since the election, the left-wing activists in Broward County have been coming up with more and more ballots out of nowhere,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWe all know what is going on. Every person in Florida knows exactly what is happening. Their goal is to keep mysteriously finding more votes until the elections turn out the way they want.\u201d\n\nScott, who faces an ethics complaint for using his official office to campaign, took no questions from reporters and later appeared on Fox\u2019s conservative \u201cHannity\u201d show, where the governor mentioned his call for an investigation and the lawsuits and accused \u201cDemocratic D.C. lawyers\u201d of wanting to \u201csteal this election.\u201d\n\nAt about that time, 9:38 p.m., the Fox-watching president took to Twitter for the first time since the election to weigh in on the controversy: \u201cLaw Enforcement is looking into another big corruption scandal having to do with Election Fraud in #Broward and Palm Beach. Florida voted for Rick Scott!\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s allegations about \u201cballots out of nowhere\u201d \u2014 the same words Trump used on Monday \u2014 is rooted in Broward County\u2019s failure to regularly update the state voting system every 45 minutes with ballot tallies. As a result, tens of thousands of ballots in the Democrat-heavy county were dumped into the system all at once, causing the margins in the Senate and governor\u2018s races to narrow drastically.\n\nBut neither the Department of Law Enforcement nor the Division of Elections, which Scott controls, has found evidence that ballots were just conjured up from nothing. Scott went an extra step by filing an emergency motion seeking to have department or sheriff's deputies safeguard voting machines and ballots, but Broward Circuit Chief Judge Jack Tuter on Monday said there was no evidence of an emergency justifying the order because he saw no fraud.\n\n\u201cRamp down the rhetoric,\u201d the judge said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Scott said on the show \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that \"Bill Nelson is clearly a sore loser.\u201c\n\n\u201cHe can't stand the fact that he's not going to be elected for what, the first time in decades,\u201d Scott said. \u201cHe's just here to steal this election.\u201d\n\nNelson\u2019s campaign has, in turn, accused Scott of engaging in voter suppression. Nelson\u2019s lawyer, Marc Elias, wrote on Twitter that Scott\u2019s court motions are a \u201cstunt\u201d and said of Scott, \u201cif he is confident he won,\u201c why is \u201che is so eager to stop all the lawful votes from being counted?\u201d\n\nLike Scott, Florida\u2019s other top statewide elected Republican, Sen. Marco Rubio, had said Democrats wanted to \u201csteal\u201d the vote after Election Day. But since then, he has toned it down and shifted his focus by calling out the incompetence in Broward and Palm Beach counties. Through a spokeswoman, Rubio said Monday that the recounts should continue.\n\nRep. Ted Deutch, a Democrat who represents both counties, refused to criticize the local elections chiefs in an appearance earlier Monday on CNN.

But the number of students enrolling for the first time at American colleges in fall 2017 dropped nearly 7 percent compared to the previous year, according to the 2018 Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange, an annual survey taken by the Institute of International Education. New foreign student enrollment in the U.S. dropped by 3 percent during the 2016-17 school year.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe authors of the report, which has been supported by the State Department since 1972, downplayed the role of politics \u2014 including Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 in the slowdown. They instead blamed intensifying competition from universities in other countries and the rising cost of college in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not hearing that students feel they can\u2019t come here,\u201d said Allan Goodman, president and CEO of IIE. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing that they have choices. We\u2019re hearing that there\u2019s competition from other countries.\u201d\n\nMorning Education A daily dose of education policy news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Universities in Canada, China, New Zealand, Japan and Spain all have seen gains.\n\nPhil Honeywood \u2014 CEO of the international education association in Australia, one of America\u2019s biggest competitors \u2014 told POLITICO earlier this year that \u201cWe don\u2019t actually need to be negative about the American academy, as President Trump is doing more damage to \u2018brand America\u2019 on his own than any competitor country ever could.\u201d\n\nPeter McPherson, president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, said in a statement that the slowing growth of international new student enrollment \"should be of concern to university leaders and policymakers alike.\"\n\n\u201cThe global preeminence of the American higher education system must not be taken for granted,\" McPherson said, noting that several states saw their overall international student numbers decline by double digits. That included Arkansas, Montana and Tennessee.\n\nThe new student enrollment slowdown could pose economic risks. International students at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $39 billion to the U.S. economy and supported more than 455,622 jobs during the 2017-18 school year, according to a separate report released Tuesday by NAFSA: Association of International Educators.\n\n\u201cThe United States is in an intense competition for global talent, and the unwelcoming rhetoric and policies at the highest echelons of government are reverberating and inadvertently encouraging student and scholars to study elsewhere. We urge Congress to exercise thoughtful oversight and enact welcoming, inclusive policies that will allow our international ties to flourish,\" NAFSA Executive Director and CEO Esther Brimmer said in a statement.\n\nNearly 1.1 million international students overall attended American colleges in 2017, according to the Open Doors report \u2014 up 1.5 percent from the year before. International enrollment grew even as the number of new students declined because more students stayed in the U.S. for training programs. The number of students in Optional Practical Training programs, temporary employment directly related to their area of study, grew by nearly 16 percent.\n\nChina yet again sent the most students in 2017 \u2014 363,341, nearly a third of all international students in the U.S. That marked a 3.6 percent enrollment bump, even as the Trump administration has been especially aggressive toward China, going so far as to consider banning student visas for Chinese nationals.\n\nThe proposal, which was pushed by White House aide Stephen Miller and other immigration hawks in the administration, was canned over concerns about its economic and diplomatic impact, FT reported last month.\n\nIndia, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Canada were also among those sending the most students to America last year, though the number of students coming from the latter three declined in 2017, according to the Open Doors report.\n\nNew York, California and Texas were the top destinations for international students, with New York University, the University of Southern California and Northeastern University in Boston the schools enrolling the most foreign students.\n\n", "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to the press before departing the White House for Paris on November 9, 2018 in Washington, D.C.

Trump just tore it down. GOP gerrymandering did not envision the upending of the Republican coalition.\n\nFor years, some Democrats said gerrymandering was an insurmountable roadblock to the House majority that couldn\u2019t be cleared until after the 2020 census.\n\nThen along came President Donald Trump.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHouse Democrats steamrolled Republicans in an array of districts last week, from those drawn by independent commissions or courts, to seats crafted specifically by Republicans with the intention of keeping them in the GOP column.\n\nThe overriding factor: a Republican president who political mapmakers could not have foreseen at the beginning of the decade. Trump altered the two parties\u2019 coalitions in ways that specifically undermined conventional wisdom about the House map, bringing more rural voters into the GOP tent while driving away college-educated voters.\n\nThe trade worked in some states. But it was a Republican disaster in the House, where well-off suburbs, once the backbone of many GOP districts, rebelled against Trump in 2016 and then threw out House members in 2018.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

GOP Reps. Peter Roskam and Randy Hultgren, who lost last week, had not been Democratic targets in any of the first three elections under the current map, and Mitt Romney carried their districts outside Chicago handily in the 2012 presidential election. Democrats designed the districts thinking they would elect Republicans in perpetuity, instead drawing maps aimed at flipping other districts in the state in 2012.\n\nBut Roskam\u2019s district flipped to Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016, while Trump won Hultgren\u2019s district with just 48 percent of the vote that year. More than half of Roskam\u2019s adult constituents and 40 percent of Hultgren\u2019s are college-educated, according to census data. And in the midterm elections, 26 of the 36 GOP districts that Democrats have flipped so far had larger college-educated populations than the national average.\n\n\u201cIn Illinois, we had two suburban districts that everyone assumed would be Republican holds\" but flipped, said Ian Russell, a former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee political director who coordinated with Illinois Democrats on redistricting seven years ago. He added that another district in a more rural area downstate, which was drawn for a former Democratic congressman, is still represented by a Republican.\n\n\u201cTrump accelerated all of\" those trends, Russell said.\n\nIt was much the same story for GOP members representing the suburbs in red states like Georgia and Texas. Reps. Karen Handel (R-Ga.), John Culberson (R-Texas) and Pete Sessions (R-Texas) held seats drawn by Republicans to elect Republicans before Trump was elected. All of them lost.\n\nHandel was one of just seven Republicans in the current House whose adult constituents were majority college-educated; there may be just one such member in the next Congress.\n\nThe education shift was still clear even in districts Republicans managed to hold. Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) won by just 4 points in a slice of the St. Louis suburbs where 48 percent of adults have bachelor's degrees. Wagner won by 21 points in 2016.\n\nIn California, New Jersey and elsewhere, the shifts among college-educated voters drove Republican House members out of districts that had not been battleground seats before Trump took over the political scene.\n\nDespite Democrats\u2019 massive House gains \u2014 the party\u2019s biggest since 1974, after Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation \u2014 redistricting clearly held them back in some places. Democrats netted at least 21 districts drawn by independent commissions or courts \u2014 getting a major boost from courts in Florida, Pennsylvania and Virginia that altered GOP-drawn maps in the past two years \u2014 along with 10 districts drawn by Republicans and the two in Illinois that were drawn by Democrats.\n\nIn two swing states, Ohio and North Carolina, Democratic challengers forced close races in five districts that had not previously had competitive campaigns. But they all lost to GOP incumbents, preserving Republicans\u2019 10-3 edge in North Carolina\u2019s congressional delegation and their 12-4 advantage in Ohio. Each of those districts combined Democratic-leaning big-city suburbs with stretches of heavily Republican rural territory that served as a decisive counterweight.\n\n\u201cThose suburban members who lost [in other states] would\u2019ve killed for some of those rock-ribbed rural counties,\u201d said Matt Borges, a former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, who predicted that future Republican-drawn districts would be more rural-centric.\n\n\u201cThe wall there was just a bit higher than the wave,\u201d said Russell, the former DCCC political director. He echoed other Democrats who said the party should not let its House victory or the coming presidential election sidetrack organizing in preparation for post-2020 redistricting.\n\n\u201cWe won those House seats because of the unique factors that all came together in a once-in-a-generation election \u2014 driven by Trump \u2014 to bring that margin about,\u201d said Kelly Ward, executive director of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.\n\nShe noted that many of Democrats\u2019 gains came in states with maps from courts or commissions, as opposed to seats created by Republican gerrymandering.\n\n\u201cThese districts are still not fair,\" Ward said of the overall House map. \"It\u2019s like we just finished book four of Harry Potter, but the bad guys are still out there.\u201d", "The move follows a search by CEO Jeff Bezos that spanned more than a year. | Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images Technology Amazon picks Northern Virginia, New York City to split new HQ\n\nAmazon will divide its much-anticipated new headquarters between Crystal City in Northern Virginia and Long Island City in Queens, New York, a source with knowledge of the plan confirmed to POLITICO on Monday night.\n\nThe move follows a search that spanned more than a year and prompted local governments across North America to scramble to offer tax breaks and other incentives to win the company's favor.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAmazon's split decision means the selected locations can expect to share as many as 50,000 jobs and roughly $5 billion in investment.\n\nThe news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nState and local officials are expected to make an official announcement on Tuesday, the source said. Amazon declined to comment.\n\nBy distributing the \"HQ2\" across the two communities, the e-commerce giant may be trying to ease the expected strain on housing and traffic that will accompany such a large project \u2014 and avoid the kind of civic tensions the company has sparked in its original home base of Seattle.\n\nMorning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

In addition to owning The Post, the Amazon CEO bought D.C.'s biggest house in 2016. Amazon sees the federal government as a huge customer for its cloud computing services, and the company maintains a large lobbying operation in the capital to push its agenda on everything from delivery drones to online privacy.\n\nNew York also checks many of the boxes for Amazon, including a large population rich in technically skilled talent. Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters last week that \"I am doing everything I can\" to lure the company, adding, \u201cI\u2019ll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that\u2019s what it takes.\"\n\nAmazon kicked off the \"Hunger Games\"-like headquarters search in September 2017, making an open call for bids from local and regional governments in North America. The company's wish list included an area with more than one million residents as well as easy access to public transit and an international airport. Cultural fit \u2014 described as a diverse population and business-friendly government \u2014 was also a criterion.\n\nThat promise was enough to garner bids from 238 economic development offices across the U.S., Mexico and Canada, a list the company then winnowed to 20 finalists in January.\n\nThe national search sparked hope that Amazon might choose a promising mid-size city, perhaps in the American heartland, that would be transformed by an influx of high-paying, high-skilled jobs. That choice would have countered the narrative that the tech industry's economic growth has mainly benefited coastal urban centers. Instead, the company has chosen East Coast hubs where it already has sizable operations.\n\nThe process attracted criticism from some who questioned the economic prudence of offering billions of dollars in tax incentives to one of the world\u2019s wealthiest companies.\n\nThe bid of Newark, N.J., for example, included tax incentives that would climb to $5 billion or more depending on the number of people Amazon hired. Maryland's appeal for Montgomery County totaled $3 billion in tax breaks and grants and $2 billion in transportation investments.\n\nSuch incentives present a gamble for officials who are banking on long-term economic growth to recoup massive corporate handouts. Wisconsin is grappling with those risks now after offering a multibillion-dollar financial package to Taiwanese electronics maker Foxconn to build a manufacturing plant in the state, only to see the company scale back its promises \u2014 a possible factor in Republican Gov. Scott Walker's electoral defeat last week.\n\nMuch of Amazon's selection process was kept hidden from the public as finalists signed non-disclosure agreements that precluded them from sharing details. Amazon visited each of the finalists this spring and, according to media reports, organized follow-up visits with top contenders this fall.\n\nRosa Goldensohn contributed to this article.", "Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker was previously a U.S. attorney and frequent Republican candidate for political office in Iowa. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo Legal Whitaker consulting \u2018ethics officials\u2019 on possible recusal from Mueller probe\n\nAttorney General Matthew Whitaker is consulting with ethics officials regarding possible recusal from overseeing the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation, the Justice Department said on Monday.\n\n\u201cActing Attorney General Matt Whitaker is fully committed to following all appropriate processes and procedures at the Department of Justice, including consulting with senior ethics officials on his oversight responsibilities and matters that may warrant recusal,\u201d Kerri Kupec, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement on Monday night.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhitaker has been overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation since last Wednesday, when Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 resignation triggered a set of events that left Whitaker, Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, in charge of the inquiry instead of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nDemocrats have sharply criticized Whitaker over his numerous past statements questioning Mueller\u2019s investigation, including suggestions that a possible Sessions replacement could slash the special counsel\u2019s budget so low that any further efforts would cease.

Westrup said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was working closely with the state\u2019s top emergency officials.\n\nIn general, former FEMA administrators appointed by presidents of both parties said Trump\u2019s personal responses to disasters appeared to have no bearing on the government\u2019s on-the-ground response to them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the rhetoric and what really happens,\u201d said Craig Fugate, who led FEMA under President Barack Obama. \u201cNone of this on the surface to me seems like the rhetoric is interfering with the process.\u201d\n\nR. David Paulison, the FEMA administrator under President George W. Bush, said, \u201cI\u2019ve watched the responses as best as I can from afar and I have not seen anything to indicate the response has been partisan one way or another.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, critics have accused Trump\u2019s administration of responding more attentively to disasters in places that voted for him, like Texas and Florida, than in Puerto Rico, which holds no sway in Congress or the Electoral College \u2014 and where Trump is unpopular.\n\nCalifornia leaders worried that such favoritism might be unfolding over the weekend when Trump in a tweet exhorted the state to fix its \u201cgross mismanagement of the forests\u201d or face \u201cno more Fed payments!\u201d\n\n\u201cLives have been lost.

Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nBy that point, the president had followed up with a more sympathetic Saturday evening tweet praising the first responders fighting the fire, and he tweeted a similar message of support again on Monday.\n\nStill, it\u2019s not the first time Trump has threatened California\u2019s funding. In October, he complained about the federal money going to fighting wildfires in the state \u2014 where roughly 60 percent of forestland is managed by the federal government \u2014 and warned, \u201cCalifornia ought to get their act together.\u201d\n\nBut lawmakers in both parties have already come together twice to block Trump\u2019s requested cuts to federal agencies that manage the country\u2019s forests, and earlier this year Congress approved new funding streams for combating wildfires.\n\nIt\u2019s not just money for firefighting that Trump has threatened to cut off, but federal funds for California in general. In a Fox News interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly in February 2017, Trump said California was \u201cout of control\u201d because of efforts to enact a \u201csanctuary state\u201d law that would have barred state and local law enforcement officials from cooperating with the enforcement of federal immigration laws.\n\n\u201cIf we have to, we\u2019ll defund,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe give tremendous amounts of money to California.\u201d\n\nBut that threat was tested two months later, when Brown requested federal funds to repair damage from severe winter storms. Despite the talk of defunding, Trump granted half a billion dollars in disaster relief.\n\nCalifornia went on to pass its sanctuary state law last October, and the Trump administration has unsuccessfully challenged it in court. There is no evidence Trump has been able to \u201cdefund\u201d the state over the law.\n\n\u201cThe Trump White House clearly is at odds with California,\u201d said Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution who served as a speechwriter to former California Gov.

George W. Bush visited in 2007 to tour damage from wildfires that killed 17 people. This fall\u2019s fires have already claimed twice as many lives.\n\nOn Monday evening, the White House said no decision had been made about a possible Trump visit.\n\n\u201cThe President continues to monitor this very dangerous situation and the ongoing rescue and relief efforts,\u201d spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement. \u201cAs he said, the people of California affected by this horrific disaster are in our prayers.\u201d\n\nAnd while there are no current plans for the president to travel out west, Gidley said FEMA Administrator Brock Long will be in the state Tuesday \u201cat the emergency operations center and visiting the impacted areas with local officials in the coming days.\u201d", "While former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's move would seem to solidify his place in the private sector, he didn\u2019t rule out a return to elected office. | Jae C.

The resort on its website describes itself as offering an \u201cunmatched escape that embodies the barefoot elegance of Southern California\u2019s coastal lifestyle.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBondi attended the event as Florida formally kicked off expected recounts Saturday for three statewide races, including U.S. Senate, governor, agriculture commissioner and three state legislative races.\n\nHer office got in the mix Sunday, firing off letters asking state election officials to investigate any voter fraud and blasting state law enforcement for not pursuing voter fraud because election officials told them there was none.\n\nA letter from her office was sent to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement on Sunday evening after Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s Senate campaign called on the agency to investigate voter fraud in Palm Beach and Broward counties. One day after Scott\u2019s request last Thursday, FDLE said that the Florida Department of State, which oversees state elections, had no fraud allegations to report, so FDLE did not start any investigations.\n\nThe fact FDLE said there was no voter fraud to report was used as pushback by Democrats when Republicans, including Scott and President Donald Trump, alleged without evidence that fraud was occurring in those Democratic-leaning counties.\n\nIn a letter, Bondi said the response from FDLE was not good enough.\n\n\u201cCommissioner, protesters continue to grow around the state as well as additional complaints of election impropriety,\u201d Bondi wrote to FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen. \u201cYour duty to investigate this matter is clear. I am directing you to take the necessary steps to promote public safety and to assure that our state will guarantee integrity in our election process.\u201d\n\nBondi declined to comment for this story, but a source familiar with the event says she was at the Republican attorneys general gathering through at least Sunday night, which means she was \u201cdirecting\u201d state law enforcement from the political event at the California resort. The event began Saturday and is scheduled to run through Tuesday, according to a schedule of events that lists Bondi as an attendee.\n\nIn a separate letter to Secretary of State Ken Detzner, who heads state elections, Bondi formally asked his office to \u201creport any reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to both the statewide prosecutor and sate attorney.\u201d\n\nRAGA is a Washington-based group that raises money for and helps coordinate campaigns for Republican attorneys general. This year, the group played a role in electing Bondi\u2019s replacement, Republican Attorney General Ashley Moody, who was also at the California event.", "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and her allies are framing a speakership victory as a matter of protecting political progress for women at a critical moment. | Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo Congress 'It would look ridiculous': Pelosi and allies warn against ousting a woman She and her allies argue she can\u2019t be denied the speakership after Democrats seized the House on a wave of female support.\n\nNancy Pelosi is making gender a central part of her bid to reclaim the speaker\u2019s gavel \u2014 leaning hard into the pitch that Democrats cannot oust the only woman at their leadership table following a historic election for women.\n\nIn addition to arguing she\u2019s the best qualified for the job, the California Democrat and her allies are also framing a Pelosi victory as a matter of protecting political progress for women at a critical moment.

The group was instrumental in endorsing or financially supporting more than 63 female House candidates, including many who won last Tuesday but have expressed reservations about Pelosi.\n\nThe gender-inflected pitch comes as other women in the caucus are at risk of getting big-footed by their male counterparts. Rep. Cheri Bustos, a rising star from a red district in Illinois, had been carefully laying the groundwork to run for assistant Democratic leader. But after the party\u2019s triumph in the midterms, Pelosi ally and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Ben Ray Lujan decided to jump into the race, all but forcing her out.\n\nRealizing she didn\u2019t have a shot against the man who helped win back the majority for the party, Bustos bowed out of the race and is now running for DCCC chair against several other colleagues.\n\nA similar situation is unfolding for California Rep. Barbara Lee, a veteran progressive leader gunning for the No. 5 position next year: Democratic Caucus chair. Lee had been wooing supporters for months. But after the election, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a charismatic New Yorker whom many believe could be speaker one day, declared for the position.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/795/1155968404_5859496769001_5859491003001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nShould both women lose their races, and the current top three leadership structure remain, Pelosi would be the only woman alongside Minority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Minority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.).\n\nFour men will continue to run the Senate: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and John Thune (R-S.D.) will soon replace outgoing GOP whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), while Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) will continue to lead the minority party.\n\nIn a Sunday interview with CBS\u2018 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Pelosi suggested that the current male-dominated congressional structure \u2014 and Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat in 2016 \u2014 was a primary reason she sought to extend her time in the House. When she came to Washington, Democrats had only 12 women in the chamber; now they have about 90.\n\n\u201cIf Hillary had won, I could go home,\u201d Pelosi told host Margaret Brennan, adding that if a woman were president she could have ensured \u201cthere\u2019s a woman at the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot have the four leaders of Congress [and] the president of the United States, these five people, and not have the voice of women,\u201d Pelosi continued. \u201cEspecially since women were the majority of the voters, the workers in campaigns, and now part of this glorious victory.\u201d\n\nOthers are making the same case for her. Incoming House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings said on ABC\u2018s \u201cThis Week\u201d that Pelosi has \u201cgot my vote\u201d and that it would be a \u201cdamn shame\u201d if the caucus \u201creplaced this fearless leader with a man.\u201d\n\nOutside women\u2019s advocacy groups are also getting involved.\n\n\u201cShe is a selfless feminist dedicated to equality and a brilliant strategist who works tirelessly to get the job done,\u201d the Feminist Majority wrote in a statement endorsing Pelosi\u2019s bid for speaker.\n\nSome of these groups could have serious sway with female candidates. The EMILY\u2019s List political arm, WOMEN VOTE!, was projected to spend at least $37 million on independent expenditures for its candidates and bundle another $10 million. Many of the women receiving such support will show up in Congress next year.\n\nStill, several of their endorsed candidates have been lukewarm to Pelosi. Connecticut Democrat Johanna Hayes was unequivocal in her primary, saying \"I would not vote for Nancy Pelosi\u201d when her Democratic opponent expressed openness to supporting Pelosi.\n\nSimilarly, Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.), Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and a handful of others have all either said they won\u2019t back Pelosi or call for new leadership.\n\nPelosi has a narrow margin for error, with at least 10 incumbents or incoming lawmakers committing to vote against her on the House floor.\n\nDepending on how many seats Democrats net in the midterms when all the votes are counted, Pelosi won\u2019t be able to afford to lose many more.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed a statement from the Feminist Majority to the Feminist Majority Foundation."]
