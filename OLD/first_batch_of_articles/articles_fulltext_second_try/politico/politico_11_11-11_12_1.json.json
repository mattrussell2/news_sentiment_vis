["Jerome Corsi said he's raising money for his legal defense. | AP Photo Legal Roger Stone ally expecting Mueller indictment Jerome Corsi, a longtime Stone associate and conspiracy theorist, said Mueller snared him in a 'perjury trap.'\n\nJerome Corsi, an ally of longtime Donald Trump associate Roger Stone, said Monday that he expected to be indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller for perjury.\n\nCorsi, a conspiracy theorist who has been meeting with Mueller\u2018s team for two months, said that he spoke to prosecutors for around 40 hours but that talks had \u201call blown up.\u201c\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI\u2018m going to be indicted,\u201c he said in a livestreamed video. \u201cI anticipate being indicted.\u201c\n\nReports have suggested that Mueller\u2018s interest in Corsi stems from a review of communications between him and Stone in 2016 about an impending release of Clinton campaign emails by WikiLeaks, the transparency activist organization. Mueller is investigating whether any Americans had advance knowledge of the email dump, which dominated the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nCorsi called the impending indictment the result of a \u201cperjury trap,\u201c though he emphasized that he wasn\u2018t totally sure what the indictment might be for. Corsi\u2018s attorney declined to comment.\n\nCorsi also repeatedly emphasized his continued support for Trump\u2018s presidency and urged backers to send him money for his legal defense.\n\n\u201cI think my crime, really, is supporting Donald Trump,\u201c he said, in between long rants about voter fraud and suggesting that Democrats intend to overthrow Trump.\n\nCorsi said prosecutors showed up at his house on Aug. 28, just before his 72nd birthday, and presented a subpoena. He said he didn\u2018t talk to them at the time. But later, with his lawyer present, Corsi said, he met multiple times with Mueller\u2018s team in Washington. He recalled prosecutors Jeannie Rhee, Aaron Zelinsky and Andrew Goldstein being present.\n\nCorsi also said he was raising money for his legal defense.\n\nHis hourlong remarks meandered among various conspiracy theories, suggesting \u201ccriminals\u201c were running the Justice Department and that Democrats were seeking to \u201coverthrow\u201c Trump.\n\n\u201cIn prison, if I\u2018m allowed to write, maybe I\u2018ll do some fiction about this,\u201c he said.\n\nCorsi gained notoriety as the author of a book questioning John Kerry\u2018s military service during the 2004 presidential campaign. He also fomented birtherism, a conspiracy theory that Trump ultimately championed as well. Trump once retweeted a Corsi article claiming baselessly that Obama\u2018s administration fabricated jobs numbers.\n\nAccording to an ABC report last month, Corsi was scheduled to appear before the Mueller grand jury on Nov. 2. But reporters at the Washington courthouse that day did not see him enter or leave the building.\n\nDuring a webcast last Monday, Corsi said he\u2019d been involved \u201cin a really constant basis\u201d with the Mueller investigation for about two months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d been one of the biggest pushes of my life,\u201d he said on the show . Beyond that, Corsi said, he couldn\u2019t talk about the special counsel inquiry.\n\n\u201cThere will come a time when I can and will talk about it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut right now I\u2019m going to continue to follow my lawyer\u2019s advice and be in a \u2018no comment\u2018 mode.\u201d", "Rep. Elijah Cummings argued that picking House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to become speaker would prevent a divisive campaign that could shatter Democratic unity. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Congress Cummings urges reluctant Dems to back Pelosi for speaker if she wins caucus vote\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), an influential House Democrat, pleaded Monday with colleagues and incoming House freshmen to reject the efforts of a \"small group\" of Democrats he said is \"trying to generate opposition\" to Nancy Pelosi's bid for the speakership.\n\n\"For two years, they asserted that with Nancy Pelosi as our leader, Democrats could never win back the House. They claimed that these relentless Republican attacks made Leader Pelosi appear too divisive, and they argued that she should step aside for the good of the party,\" Cummings wrote in a \"Dear Colleague\" letter to the incoming class of Democrats. \"But then last Tuesday happened. And the American people obliterated the theory that Nancy Pelosi could not lead House Democrats to victory.\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCummings, a Maryland Democrat who has represented a Baltimore district since the 1996 elections, offered a preview of how Pelosi's allies will attempt to counter arguments that she's overstayed her welcome as Democratic leader \u2014 she's led the party in the House for 16 years \u2014 and has become a divisive figure that has jeopardized Democratic gains in swing House districts.\n\nA slew of Democratic victors in last week's elections vowed to oppose Pelosi in a House floor vote, imperiling her bid for a second stint as speaker. But no alternative candidate has emerged yet, and Pelosi's allies are beginning to mount a forceful campaign suggesting that Pelosi's leadership and experience is necessary to guide the new Democratic majority.\n\nCummings suggested that lawmakers who have vowed to oppose Pelosi should feel free to vote their conscience during a closed-door vote of the Democratic caucus, where a majority of votes will carry the day. But once the battle moves to the House floor, Cummings said, all Democrats should unite behind the winner -- and if it's Pelosi, give her a resounding vote of support to blunt opposition by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.\n\n\"After we as Democrats make our selection, our new members should not be pressured into voting against our party\u2019s nominee on the House floor in January\u2014when the choice will be between the Democratic candidate and the Republican candidate,\" Cummings wrote.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/2910/1155968404_5940956678001_5940956253001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nCummings, who is expected to become the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has tangled with Republicans for years over some of Congress' highest-profile investigations and is expected to play a central role in a wave of investigations of the Trump administration next year. Though his support of Pelosi was expected, his arguments against the tactics of a band of Pelosi detractors are a window into how Pelosi will attempt to overcome some of the arguments offered by critics within the Democratic Party.\n\nCummings noted that Democrats' most potent issue in the 2018 campaign was health care, an issue he said Pelosi is more closely identified with than any other elected Democrats. \"There would not be an Affordable Care Act without her, and no one has battled more effectively to defend it,\" he argued.\n\nBut most of all, Cummings argued that picking Pelosi would prevent a brutal and divisive campaign that could shatter Democratic unity before the new Congress even gets underway.\n\n\"Our new members promised their constituents to bring stability and common-sense to a dysfunctional Washington\u2014not to be drawn into an effort to throw the House into chaos,\" he added. \"Our new members promised to get results on the issues their constituents care about\u2014not to delay these efforts while they are dragged into a self-destructive leadership battle.\"", "Rep.

Kyrsten Sinema has defeated Republican Rep. Martha McSally in the battle for the open Senate seat in Arizona, giving Democrats their second Senate pickup of the cycle.\n\nSinema had 49.7 percent of the vote to McSally\u2019s 48 percent when The Associated Press called the race Monday evening. Though McSally led narrowly on Election Night, Sinema took the lead in the race two days later and continued to pad her edge as the state counted outstanding votes through the weekend and Monday.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSinema\u2019s victory gives Democrats their second pickup of the election, and limits Republican gains in the chamber to just one seat so far, pending a recount in Florida and a runoff in Mississippi. Her victory guarantees Democrats will hold at least 47 Senate seats.\n\nMcSally, in a Twitter video Monday evening, said she called Sinema to concede the race and congratulated the Democrat for becoming Arizona\u2019s first woman elected to the Senate after a \u201chard-fought battle.\u201d She thanked her campaign staff and voters who supported her.\n\n\u201cWe sure wish it came out with a different result, but I\u2019m so thankful for you,\u201d McSally said.\n\nRepublican Rep. Martha McSally, a former fighter pilot first elected to Congress in 2014, jumped into the race following GOP Sen. Jeff Flake\u2019s retirement announcement. | Matt York/AP Photo\n\nSinema, in her victory speech Monday night, said she was grateful to McSally for her service, but said there was a clear choice in the race between them.\n\n\u201cArizonans had a choice between two very different ways forward: One focused on fear and party politics, and one focused on Arizona and the issues that matter to everyday families,\u201d Sinema said. \u201cArizona rejected what has become far too common in our country: name-calling, petty personal attacks, and doing and saying whatever it takes just to get elected.\u201d\n\nShe also praised late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) several times, calling him \u201cirreplaceable\u201d and saying \u201chis example shines a light on our way forward.\u201d\n\nIn addition to being Arizona\u2019s first female senator, Sinema is the first Democrat to win a Senate election there in three decades.

McSally, a former fighter pilot first elected to Congress in 2014, jumped into the race following Flake\u2019s retirement announcement.\n\nMcSally kept close to the president as she navigated a Republican primary against two well-known immigration hardliners: former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who challenged McCain in a 2016 primary, and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was pardoned by Trump last year after being convicted on criminal contempt charges.\n\nMcSally ultimately dispatched both Republican challengers, winning slightly more than 50 percent of the vote in the late-August primary. But Sinema had already staked herself to a substantial lead in most public polls after running millions of dollars of ads on TV throughout the summer touting independence and bipartisanship. Republicans hardly countered the spending as they fought to boost McSally in the primary.\n\nSinema focused relentlessly on health care throughout the race. She sharply criticized McSally for supporting the failed Republican health care plan in the House in 2017, saying McSally abandoned those with pre-existing conditions by supporting a bill that weakened protections. But she also tacked decisively to the center, distancing herself from the national party, including being the first Democratic Senate candidate to pledge not to vote for Sen. Chuck Schumer as Democratic leader.\n\nMcSally and her Republican allies painted Sinema as too liberal for the state, highlighting her past as a Green Party activist. They attacked her late in the race with a stream of videos showing past jokes Sinema had made aimed at Arizona, and ran TV ads scrutinizing Sinema\u2019s antiwar activism during the George W. Bush administration, including one in which she was wearing a tutu while protesting. McSally accused Sinema of supporting \u201ctreason\u201d during their sole debate.\n\nBut the attacks weren\u2019t enough to diminish the lead and reputation Sinema had created through the earlier months of the campaign.\n\nThe race saw tens of millions in outside spending flow into the state, flooding the airwaves with largely negative ads on both sides.\n\nDemocrats are likely to continue to target Arizona in the 2020 presidential election and in future statewide contests. Sen. Jon Kyl is currently Arizona\u2019s other senator, having been appointed earlier this year to replace McCain, who died in August. Kyl has not pledged to serve the remainder of his term, but Kyl or a potential replacement would have to run in a special election in 2020, and again in 2022.\n\nSinema is the first Democrat to win a Senate election in Arizona since Dennis DeConcini in 1988. Other than DeConcini, no Democrat has represented Arizona in the Senate since Carl Hayden retired in 1968.\n\n", "\"I put out a statement yesterday, and we stand by that statement, and that's all I'm going to say about it,\" said Republican Sen.

But she said in her statement that she was referring to \"accepting an invitation to a speaking engagement.\"\n\n\"In referencing the one who invited me, I used an exaggerated expression of regard, and any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous,\u201d Hyde-Smith said in the statement.\n\nEspy, who was drawn into a runoff with the senator after neither earned 50 percent of the vote on Nov. 6, has called her comment \"reprehensible\" and out of touch in Mississippi, which has a history of lynchings. Hyde-Smith was appointed to the Senate seat after Republican Thad Cochran resigned. The winner of the runoff will serve the remaining two years of Cochran's term.\n\nMississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, also a Republican, said at the event Monday that sometimes politicians say things they \"could have phrased better,\" but he said he believes that Hyde-Smith did not mean any offense by her remark.\n\n\"I know this woman, and I know her heart.

Democrats on the other hand, are more than willing to try and use the hand of government to lower prices. And while Democrats have, so far, not been vocal supporters of the Trump plan, they have not completely dismissed it either. Therefore, there may be an opportunity to for the two sides to cooperate to a limited degree. But even a limited degree of cooperation is politically dicey for Democrats because providing Republicans with any victory on the drug price issue means it may be a less powerful issue for them in 2020.\u201d\n\nGOP RUSHES TO MATCH DEM DONATIONS: \u201cMitch McConnell stood before a roomful of Republican donors on Wednesday night to thank them for their help in the midterms,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Alex Isenstadt reports. \u201cBut the Senate leader also issued a dire warning: Democrats had just thumped them in the all-important online donor game, and the GOP badly needs to catch up. The heart of the problem, McConnell said at the event at party headquarters on Capitol Hill, is ActBlue. The Democratic fundraising tool funneled over $700 million in small donations to House and Senate candidates over the course of the 2018 campaign. The GOP leader said Republicans were getting swamped in the hunt for online givers and that he\u2019d charged his political team with coming up with a solution to enable them to compete in 2020.\n\n\u2014 \u201cMcConnell\u2019s push underscores the urgency confronting Republicans. In race after race, turbocharged liberal donors pumped cash into Democratic coffers \u2014 much of it through ActBlue, an easy-to-use site that allows givers to plug in their credit card information and send contributions to their candidate of choice with a click. Republicans have no such centralized fundraising platform.

About half of the RNC spending came in two installments -- $367,000 for travel expenses at Trump National Doral Miami in mid-June, after the group's spring meetings at the Florida club, and $222,000 for \u2018venue rental and catering\u2019 at Mar-A-Lago in March connected to fundraising events at the resort. Trump's own presidential reelection campaign was also among the groups spending the most at Trump properties throughout 2017 and 2018, despite not being on the ballot. The campaign has spent more than $950,000 at Trump properties since the start of 2017.\u201d Full story.\n\nJoin POLITICO on Nov. 14 for special editorial conversations at \u201cThe Salute to Military Spouses,\u201d a half-day summit to raise awareness of the challenges and contributions of these unsung heroes.

Bill Nelson is calling on Gov. Rick Scott to recuse himself from overseeing Florida\u2019s midterm recount, a call that will no doubt be ignored but represents the rising tensions in the two-day-old process now beset with courtroom drama and political protests.\n\nThat call came as a Broward County judge is urging both sides to \u201cramp down the rhetoric\u201d swirling around the recount process that involves not only the Senate race between Scott and Nelson but also the Florida governor\u2019s race and agriculture commissioner race. Three local legislative races are also under ongoing machine recounts.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNelson joins the League of Women voters in calling on Scott to no longer oversee a recount that involves his political campaign. After Scott did not respond to their letter asking him to recuse himself, the League filed a federal lawsuit that would require Scott to step aside from overseeing the recount. As governor, Scott oversees the Florida Department of State, which houses the state Division of Elections.\n\n\u201c[Rick Scott] should remove himself from any role in the recount process so the people can have the confidence in the integrity of the election,\u201d Nelson said in a video statement released by his campaign.\n\n\u201cGiven his efforts to undermine the votes of Floridians, this is the only way that we can ensure that the people\u2019s votes are protected,\u201d added Nelson, who has not answered live questions in days.\n\nThe intensifying jabs come as local election officials continue with a machine recount of 8 million ballots. The deadline for finishing that is Thursday, after which any race within a .25 percent margin would head to a hand recount, a drawn-out process that no doubt would lead to a glaring international spotlight on Florida, potentially for weeks.\n\nBrad Todd, a partner with Virginia-based OnMessage, a firm that has long advised Scott politically, swung back at Nelson during a CNN interview Monday, saying he thinks Nelson will have to make a decision about whether to keep the recount going on Thursday, which is the deadline for machine vote recounts.\n\n\u201cNelson\u2019s lawyers get paid a lot. They would like to do this all winter,\u201d Todd said. \u201cHe has to decide on Thursday, when he is going to trail significantly, does he want his entire legacy to be painted as the guy who wouldn\u2019t go away when he was voted out by the people of Florida?\u201d\n\nNelson\u2019s call for Scott to step aside from overseeing the recount came the same day that the Democratic National Committee, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and VoteVets, a liberal super PAC, filed yet another lawsuit in Broward County court seeking to count vote-by-mail ballots that were cast before the deadline, but not received until after the deadline for unspecified problems with mail service.\n\n\u201cThe outright rejection of such ballots, based on arbitrary conditions \u2014 namely the timeliness of post office delivery \u2014 outside the voter\u2019s control unlawfully infringes upon the fundamental right to vote,\u201d wrote Marc Elias, an attorney representing the groups and, separately, the Nelson campaign.\n\nVote-by-mail ballots must be received by local supervisors of elections by 7 p.m. on Election Day under Florida law. The lawsuit wants to change that, arguing that any vote-by-mail ballot postmarked by Election Day should be counted. This year, 878,818 vote-by-mail ballots were requested and not returned, which could be caused by any number of factors.\n\nScott\u2019s campaign filed its own lawsuit Sunday night asking a judge to invalidate any vote counted in Broward County that came in after noon on Saturday, which is the deadline for supervisors to file their unofficial vote totals. Attorneys for the Broward County Supervisor of Election\u2019s office quickly fired back with their own legal response noting that they had not yet reached the final official deadline.\n\n\u201cPlaintiff has invented a false deadline for completing canvass of ballots where none in fact exists,\u201d read the response. \u201cThe first unofficial results are just that \u2014 i.e., unofficial.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s campaign Sunday night also filed lawsuits in Democrat-heavy Broward and Palm Beach Counties asking courts to order law enforcement to \u201cimpound\u201d voting machines and vote tallying equipment in those counties, two places where election offices have been under heat from Republicans who, without evidence, have said they are hotbeds for voter fraud.\n\nA Broward County judge on Monday morning denied attempts by Scott\u2019s campaign to have law enforcement impound voting machines but did add three Broward County sheriff\u2019s deputies to the facility, which attorney Elias said the Nelson campaign supports.\n\nDuring that hearing, a Broward County judge warned both sides to \u201cramp down the rhetoric\u201d that is getting much of the national spotlight.\n\nScott\u2019s legal push to treat local election offices like crime scenes added gas to what had already been a combustible mix of political and legal fights. Democrats responded by calling Scott a \u201cdictator\u201d for that push, while Scott\u2019s camp said that it only wants to protect the vote.\n\n\"In suing to seize ballots and impound voting machines, Rick Scott is doing his best to impersonate Latin American dictators who have overthrown democracies in Venezuela and Cuba,\" Florida Democratic Party Executive Director Juan Pe\u00f1alosa said in a statement. \"The governor is using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of Democracy.\"\n\nFiring back on Twitter, Scott adviser Chris Hartline said Pe\u00f1alosa needed to \"cut down on the Red Bull.\"\n\n\"We requested that ballots and voting machines be protected when not in use,\" he tweeted. \"The only reason not to protect the integrity of the ballots and the voting machines is if you are actively promoting or hoping for fraud.\"", "In 2016, the Christie administration paid a $1.5 million settlement to a former assistant county prosecutor who claimed the administration took over his office and fired him. | AP Photo Lesser-known Christie scandal could resurface if he\u2019s tapped for AG\n\nA scandal not nearly as infamous as Bridgegate could have major implications for former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie if he\u2019s nominated to become the next U.S. Attorney General.\n\nIn 2016, the Christie administration paid a $1.5 million settlement to a former assistant county prosecutor who claimed the administration took over his office and fired him, all with the aim of dismissing the office\u2019s 43-count indictment against several of the governor\u2019s allies that embarrassed one of Christie\u2019s major contributors.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat whistleblower, Bennett Barlyn, told POLITICO on Monday that he has grave concerns about Christie becoming the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official, and his case could take on new relevance, with the next attorney general poised to take over the department that oversees the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election.\n\nBarlyn said that if Christie is nominated, the Senate should look at this case as just one way the former governor wielded justice, both as governor and U.S. Attorney, for political ends. Barlyn noted that during Christie\u2019s time as U.S. Attorney, some companies entered into deferred prosecution agreements with the office in which, rather than face prosecution, they paid Christie\u2019s allies millions of dollars to monitor them.\n\nBarlyn was an assistant prosecutor in Hunterdon County in 2010, when his office issued 43-count indictment against the then-county sheriff, Deborah Trout, and two subordinates, on official misconduct and other charges, including forcing employees to sign loyalty oaths, not conducting required employee background checks and making a fake sheriff\u2019s office ID card for a well-connected Christie campaign contributor.\n\nA staffer in the sheriff\u2019s office told a local newspaper in May 2010 that he heard then-Undersheriff Michael Russo, one of the two Trout underlings indicted, say Christie would \u201cstep in (and) have this whole thing thrown out.\u201d Indeed, soon after the indictments were unsealed, then-New Jersey Attorney General Paula Dow \u2014 whom Christie nominated \u2014 took over the Hunterdon County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. Three months after Russo\u2019s alleged statement was reported, Dow successfully asked a judge to dismiss the indictments based on \u201clegal and factual deficiencies.\u201d\n\nA month later, Barlyn, who had complained about the handling of the case by the Christie administration, was fired.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to move on. Of course when he was considered a nominee I got a call from some people saying, \u2018What do yo think about this?\u2019\u201d Barlyn, who\u2019s now a fifth grade teacher in Pennsylvania, told POLITICO. \u201cMy view is, in one sense he\u2019s absolutely the wrong man for the job in an objective and ethical sense. And then given why he\u2019d be hired, he\u2019s the perfect man for the job.\u201d\n\nChristie is reportedly under serious consideration by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration for the attorney general post in the wake of Jeff Sessions\u2019 forced resignation. Christie has been clear in the past that he desires the job.\n\nThe Hunterdon County case received scant attention until the Bridgegate scandal exploded. But Barlyn sued over his termination, and a New York Times columnist took up his story in 2013.\n\nThe Christie administration never admitted wrongdoing. Nevertheless, in 2016, after spending several million dollars to defend itself in the case, the state paid Barlyn a $1.5 million settlement.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no doubt whatsoever that the orders relating to the dismissal of the indictment came straight from the governor\u2019s office. That\u2019s not in dispute,\u201d Barlyn said.\n\nChristie, contacted through a spokesman, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHowever, in a statement late Monday, Mike DuHaime, a former Christie adviser, said, \u201cAnyone using this case to try to hurt Gov. Christie would only do so because there\u2019s a personal or political motive, not because there are merits to this case.\u201d\n\nTrout filed her own lawsuit for prosecutorial misconduct, which a state appellate court dismissed in July 2018.\n\n\u201cFour sets of judges reviewed her claim that the grand jury presentation was flawed, and on four separate occasions four separate judges all concluded it was baseless,\u201d Barlyn said. \u201cThat\u2019s important because it\u2019s not just me. There are other avenues that really demonstrate that this case was grossly mishandled.\u201d\n\nThe state refused to allow grand jury transcripts from the indictments and other documents it claimed were privileged to be released to the public \u2014 things Barlyn said would have shown not only how strong the indictments were, but that the quashing of the case was ordered by the governor\u2019s office.\n\nInitially, speculation surrounding the Christie administration\u2019s quashing of the case focused on Trout and her friendly relationship with Christie and then-Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno. But Barlyn said he believes it all goes back to one of the men who allegedly received a fake sheriff\u2019s ID from the office: Robert Hariri.\n\nA physician, Hariri at the time was a high-ranking executive at the New Jersey-based pharmaceutical company Celgene \u2014 a company with numerous links to the Christie administration that would later hire Christie\u2019s then-chief of staff, Richard Bagger.\n\nHariri donated nearly $7,000 to Christie\u2019s first gubernatorial campaign in 2009 and served on his transition team. (Celgene\u2019s former CEO and executive chairman, Bob Hugin, ran unsuccessfully for Senate, losing last week to Democrat Bob Menendez. Staffers with ties to Christie formed a super PAC that spent millions on ads to help Hugin).\n\n\u201cI always thought if you\u2019re going to ask the question [of] where was the motive to justify dismissal of the case, to me, it still goes back to Celgene and Robert Hariri,\u201d Barlyn said.\n\nBarlyn also told POLITICO that another person who received a fake sheriff\u2019s office ID badge was Keith Schiller, then head of security for the Trump Organization.\n\nSchiller, through his lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cMy case is really a piece of that,\u201d Barlyn said. \u201c[Christie] had no qualms about exercising his law enforcement authority in a way that benefited him politically.\u201d\n\nAssemblyman John McKeon, a Democrat from Essex County who chairs his chamber\u2019s judiciary committee, said he\u2019s in court to compel the state to turn over documents from Barlyn\u2019s case. He filed a public records request for them in 2017, but even the new, Democratic administration hasn\u2019t wanted to turn them over, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeking production of a whole variety of components of the email exchanges \u2014 all but the grand jury testimony,\u201d McKeon said.\n\nThe case should weigh heavily during the Senate confirmation process if Christie is nominated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said that what happened with that [case] makes Bridgegate look like child\u2018s play,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with the integrity of a criminal investigation and the potential to have overturned an indictment. There\u2019s probably a good reason they decided to pay Mr. Barlyn in excess of $1 million.\u201c", "Democratic leadership elections are Nov. 28, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is heavily favored to be the party's choice for speaker. | Al Drago/Getty Images Congress Pro-Pelosi group opposes effort to change rules over speaker nominee\n\nA group of Nancy Pelosi's allies is fighting efforts to change House Democratic Caucus rules so that the California Democrat can't return to the speaker's chair.\n\nThe issue revolves around whether Pelosi will need 218 Democratic votes \u2014 or just a simple majority of Democrats, as the current caucus rule states \u2014 to be the party's speaker nominee when the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnti-Pelosi forces led by Reps.

Nancy Pelosi to make things interesting. It may be unlikely, but the possibility exists that they can persuade enough Democrats to support an alternative in next month\u2019s party caucus vote or, if that fails, deny Pelosi a victory on the House floor.\n\nBut any serious attempt to oust Pelosi would be brutal and divisive, potentially harming the ability of Democrats to maintain a unified front against the Trump administration. Moreover, Pelosi is one of the most ruthless and effective politicians of her generation. Not only should critics worry about the consequences of losing to her, they should also worry about the consequences of replacing a skilled, experienced tactical leader with an amateur.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSo what should restless Democrats hungering for \u201cnew leadership\u201d in the House do instead? Skip Pelosi. Challenge Steny Hoyer.\n\nThe Maryland congressman has long been the No. 2 in the House Democratic Caucus, and is positioned to be the next majority leader. At 79, he\u2019s a year older than Pelosi. He has been rivals with her\u2014losing a 2002 contest against her for whip and then, upon her initial ascension to speaker, defeating her preferred candidate for majority leader. But they have since maintained a working relationship.\n\nMany Democratic members of Congress have appreciated Hoyer\u2019s tireless fundraising efforts, traveling this election cycle to 134 congressional districts, including critical battlegrounds in Republican-leaning areas. He has also irritated progressive activists , however, by advocating for fiscal restraint of Social Security and Medicare, chiding protesters for confrontational tactics and pressuring left-wing candidates to bow out of swing-district House races.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/795/1155968404_5859496769001_5859491003001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nDislodging Pelosi is difficult in part because as the first woman to be speaker, she is a historic figure with loyal supporters, both inside the Capitol, among the donor class and across the country. There\u2019s also the argument that since Democrats won back the House, she can\u2019t have been much of a drag on the ballot after all. Unceremoniously tossing her out would stoke anger among some Democrats, both of pragmatic and progressive stripes. Not to mention that she\u2019s a master vote-counter, and anyone seeking to unseat her would have to contend with her intimate knowledge of the needs and wants of her caucus.\n\nDumping Hoyer does not present the same risk. More important, for whoever has the gumption to take him on, by jumping the line to become majority leader cues one up to become speaker upon Pelosi\u2019s eventual retirement, which she has already signaled won\u2019t be too far off.\n\nBut isn\u2019t Pelosi a terrible standard-bearer for the Democratic Party? Wasn\u2019t she a magnet for Republican attacks this year? Wouldn\u2019t insurgent Democrats be doing their party a favor by taking on the burden of forcing out Pelosi, removing the political dead weight and presenting a fresh face for 2020?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s gauge how effective those midterm election attacks actually were. \u201cI think you\u2019d have to be an idiot to think we could win the House with Pelosi at the top,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela in 2017. The idiots were right.\n\nYes, 48 Democratic challengers expressed, in some fashion, opposition to Pelosi\u2019s continued leadership. But 32 of those lost anyway (a few others are in races that haven\u2019t been called yet). And only two winners, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina\u2019s 1st District and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia\u2019s 7th, have unequivocally stated they would oppose Pelosi on the House floor; others could abide by the letter of their campaign pledges by voting against Pelosi in the party caucus vote but then, once she wins, falling in line for the final speaker vote. Another two who have signaled opposition, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan\u2019s 13th and Jahana Hayes of Connecticut\u2019s 5th, represent districts that were already in Democratic hands and unquestionably did not need to distance themselves from Pelosi to win.\n\nMeanwhile, at least 25 Democrats flipped districts without criticizing Pelosi, enough on their own for Democrats to claim a House majority, albeit barely. Distancing from Pelosi may have helped extend the scope of Democratic victories\u2014and new Democratic congresspeople from conservative areas will likely need to keep showing flashes of independence to stay in office\u2014but it wasn\u2019t the primary reason Democrats won the House.\n\nStill, isn\u2019t Pelosi wildly unpopular? Wouldn\u2019t Democrats be better off without her?\n\nAfter all, last month\u2019s Harvard-Harris Poll pegged her favorable rating at an awful 28 percent. But how does that compare with her peers? Outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan is slightly better at 31 percent. Both Senate leaders are worse: 24 percent for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, 27 percent for Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nThe fact is: Anyone who is a prominent legislative insider is destined to be unpopular. You\u2019re either making the sausage or obstructing it, neither of which looks appetizing from the outside. If you are expecting a speaker to also serve as the appealing face of your party, you are likely to be disappointed.\n\nThe question about the speakership for Democrats to ask is not, \u201cWho would be the best face of the party?\u201d There\u2019s a little thing about to happen that will answer that soon enough, and it\u2019s called the presidential primary. The correct question to ask about the speakership is: \u201cWho would be the best speaker?\u201d Who can count heads? Who can keep a caucus unified as much as possible? Who can protect vulnerable members from tricky votes? Who knows when to lean on a member for a tough vote, and when to let him or her go their own way?\n\nFor all the criticisms of Pelosi, none of them have cast doubt on her ability to actually do the job of speaker.\n\nOne of her chief Democratic critics, Rep. Seth Moulton, earlier this year was asked on POLITICO\u2019s Off Message podcast why doesn\u2019t he run for speaker. He responded in a most revealing way: \u201cI don\u2019t have any interest in being the speaker \u2026 because I think to be an effective speaker you have be very good at the, sort of, transactional, inside politics, and understanding favors. \u2026 [Pelosi is] great at that!\u201d Yes. Yes she is.\n\nHerding Democrats is always exhausting, but this caucus will be particularly challenging for the next speaker. The incoming majority includes avowed socialists from Brooklyn and Queens, wealthy business owners from Maryland and Minnesota, former CIA operatives from Virginia and Michigan, and Democrats representing Trump-friendly cities like Charleston and Oklahoma City.\n\nThe speaker will have to balance progressive base\u2019s demand for aggressive investigation of Trump, if not his immediate impeachment, with the pledges of many new members to pursue bipartisan cooperation. The left flank may demand floor votes on wish list items like \u201cMedicare for all\u201c that risk dividing the Democrats, while others may prefer to keep pressure on Republicans to produce legislation. Though it has yet to show this level of sophistication, perhaps the Trump administration will try to pick off moderates and score some legislative wins, and the speaker will have to decide when to lean on Democrats to resist, or to compromise.\n\nWhy would Democrats want to put an amateur in that tortuous position, when an experienced and proven tactician is already in place? After all, it was Pelosi who, in 2007, helped broker the last increase in the federal minimum wage by attaching it to Iraq War spending and securing President George W. Bush\u2019s signature. It was Pelosi who helped enact the Affordable Care Act in 2010, first by passing a version that included a public health insurance option, then by persuading her more progressive colleagues to sacrifice it out of political necessity. And this year, it was Pelosi who cagily opposed the bill to keep the government open, on the grounds it failed to lock in protections for immigrant Dreamers, while signaling to her vulnerable members they were free to break ranks and avoid a protracted shutdown. It\u2019s no coincidence that last week not a single incumbent Democrat lost reelection.\n\nBut Democrats can\u2019t have Pelosi work her parliamentary magic forever. It is long past time to groom a successor, someone who can work by her side and learn the ropes before ascending into the hot seat. If Hoyer won\u2019t step aside and offer someone the opportunity to serve as majority leader, then the opportunity should be seized.\n\nBill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine, and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show \u201cThe DMZ.\u201d", "Dense fog wreathed the woods where Harold Higginbottom lay deep asleep. In the inky early morning darkness, \u201cHiggie\u201d\u2014as the fellows as in the First Gas Regiment called him\u2014lay rolled snug in his blankets on a bed of leaves, not far from the German lines in the Meuse district of northeast France.\n\nA hand shook him awake at about 4 a.m. Bombs were falling, said the private who woke Higgie. German artillery was getting close, and he should take refuge deeper in the woods, along with the officers in charge of the platoon. Higgie shrugged off the warning. After 10 months in France, with more than his share of close scrapes setting chemical mortars and scrambling through no-mans-land, the artillery didn\u2019t worry him. If the bombs come any closer, then wake me up, Higgie told the private. Then he rolled over and went back to sleep.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt was November 11, 1918. A few hours later, the armistice would end World War I, a cataclysmic conflict that reshaped Europe and the world, marked the beginning of American global ascendance, and set the stage for World War II two decades later.\n\nPresident Donald Trump flew to France on Friday for ceremonies marking the centennial, which has been a rolling, multi-year commemoration in Europe since 2014. Within a day, he had created an international scandal by canceling a Saturday appearance at the memorial for the Battle of Belleau Wood \u201cdue to scheduling and logistical difficulties caused by the weather.\u201d During the June 1918 battle, U.S. Marines successfully fought off German divisions, suffering almost 10,000 casualties and just over 1,800 deaths in vicious fighting, often with knives, bayonets or hand-to-hand combat.\n\nThe president\u2019s absence elicited ferocious criticism both domestically and abroad, as well as ridicule that rain would have nixed memorializing a war in which mud was so deep that men and horses drowned. But the furor drowned out a different kind of scandal: For many Americans, the conflict is barely understood or even remembered. Eclipsed by World War II and other conflicts, the Great War seemingly erupted from an inconsequential spark, sucked in the United States for baffling reasons and embroiled the country for ambiguous goals.\n\nTo see the war as such is a mistake. This centennial and Armistice Day\u2014the predecessor of Veterans Day\u2014is an opportunity to correct amnesia about a war whose consequences still reverberate today. From the unraveling of Middle Eastern countries reshaped in the war\u2019s aftermath, to the shaping of strategic deterrence that guided the Cold War, to the re-emergence of banned chemical weapons, the Great War\u2019s legacy is still very much with us.\n\nWorld War I was extraordinary for many reasons: the staggering scope of the conflict, the more than 8 million battlefield deaths and more than 20 million casualties, the horrific conditions on the battlefield. It was also the first modern war of science, enlisting the aid of physicists, chemists and engineers to build weapons that had been the stuff of science fiction, including the chemical weapons that Higgie had been trained to use in France.\n\nThe research for my book Hellfire Boys principally focused on the largely forgotten story of the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service, which was established to answer Germany\u2019s use of chemical weapons on the battlefield. Germany first used chlorine gas on April 22, 1915, to break through the intractable deadlock of trench warfare on the Western Front.\n\nThe German\u2019s use of chemical weapons initially sparked international outrage, but soon all of the major combatants were rushing ahead with their own gas programs. Ultimately, chemical weapons gave none of the armies the edge on the battlefield they sought; rather, it just added a new layer of toxic misery to an already horrific war.\n\n\n\nWhat I initially thought would be a narrow sliver of the war proved instead to be a window into the wider consequences of this catastrophic clash for dominance of Europe. One of those consequences in the United States was a realignment of science and academia to the military. For the first time, scientists would be seen as vital to the war effort, volunteering to work on scientific problems from aviation to submarine detection to\u2014yes\u2014chemical warfare. War would never be the same again.\n\n***\n\nWith the United States\u2019 late entry into the war in April 1917, the War Department was completely unprepared for gas warfare, as it was then called, having made almost no preparations for U.S. troops facing chemical weapons on the battlefield.\n\nThe Army sought to correct that by establishing a research campus in Washington called the American University Experiment Station to work on both defensive measures, like the desperately needed gas masks and protective gear, as well as offensive capabilities\u2014explosives, bombs and American-made chemical warfare agents to answer those of the Germans. By the end of the war, there would be nearly 2,000 soldiers and scientists working on research problems there. Thousands more worked at chemical manufacturing plants, gas mask factories and satellite labs around the country, including the massive chemical warfare boomtown, Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland.\n\nThat enormous effort has parallels to the Manhattan Project of World War II, and not just because of its scope and secrecy\u2014in some ways, the effort to surpass Germany\u2019s use of chemical arms was a dry run for the race to build a nuclear bomb, with some of the very same scientists involved in both.\n\nThe War Department also knew that it would need gas troops, like the British Special Brigade and the German Pioneer Regiments that prepared and carried out gas attacks, which by mid-1917 included sulfur mustard\u2014the so-called king of the war gasses. In mid-October of 1917, Secretary of War Newton Baker authorized the formation of a new regiment, the 30th Engineers (Gas & Flame), initially comprised of a single battalion of two companies that would go to Europe to use these fearsome new weapons.\n\nHiggie was one of the earliest recruits. Barely 21, he worked at a textile plant in Lawrence, Massachusetts. A few days after the regiment was authorized, he spotted an announcement in the local paper seeking volunteers. During his lunch break at the factory, he strolled down to the recruitment office to find out more.\n\n\u201cEverything seemed alright, so I told them I would be back later,\u201d he wrote in his diary. By that Friday, he was on a train to Fort Slocum in New York, wearing a new wristwatch with glow-in-the-dark hands that his church buddies gave him as a goodbye gift. On November 7, 1917, he boarded a Washington-bound boat, and by that night, he was among the first soldiers in what would soon be called the \u201cHellfire Regiment.\u201d\n\nThough the United States entered the chemical arms race far behind its allies and Germany, it had more than caught up by the war\u2019s end. After modest beginnings, the War Department created seven companies of gas troops that went to France to fight, and authorized the formation of many more\u201436 companies in all. The capacity for domestic production of chemical weapons had surpassed all of Americas allies, and even Germany. By the end of the war, the United States had used about 1,100 tons of chemical warfare agents\u2014a tiny fraction of the 57,000 tons that Germany used\u2014but was prepared to deluge the Central Powers with chemical weapons in spring 1919.\n\nChemical weapons today are rightly seen as primitive and atavistic, cruel weapons that indiscriminately maim and kill civilians and soldiers alike. Yet even though laws of war had forbidden chemical weapons for centuries, the combatants in World War I were loath to surrender these new arms after the war.\n\nThe result was the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which forbade chemical warfare but fell short of a ban on chemical weapons. Under this regime, nations could maintain chemical stockpiles to ensure that their adversaries didn\u2019t use them. The standoff between chemically armed nations didn\u2019t prevent World War II, but it probably prevented all-out chemical warfare from erupting again after 1939. It also provided a blueprint for nuclear deterrence in the Cold War, the \u201cpeace through strength\u201d axiom which prevented\u2014for the most part\u2014direct military confrontation between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.\n\n\n\nOver time, chemical weapons slipped into expensive obsolescence, and an international consensus emerged that the world would be better off without them. That led to the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, which replaced flawed earlier treaties and banned chemical weapons altogether, instituting inspection regimes to prevent production and development of new chemical arms.\n\nAnd yet chemical weapons remain a threat a century after the end of the war. Bashar Assad\u2019s regime is accused of using chemical weapons dozens, perhaps hundreds, of times in the Syrian civil war. Russia is accused of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention with the attempted assassination of former spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, England, earlier this year. The nerve agent VX killed the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in 2017, and North Korean defectors report that artillery regiments along the Korean Peninsula\u2019s demilitarized zone are armed with chemical weapons that could kill hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of South Koreans in Seoul. \u201cEverything old is new again,\u201d one arms expert told me.\n\nHiggie, the Hellfire Boy from Lawrence, Mass., wasn\u2019t preoccupied with the geopolitics of the war, or what would come after\u2014he was concerned with survival. He had been gassed multiple times, and had seen soldiers blown to bits beside him. One of his friends from American University died instantly at his side when shrapnel drilled into his head, and he had hugged the ground as German planes bombed the regimental encampment near Montfaucon, close to the Argonne Forest, in October 1918.\n\nIn the early days of November 1918, the weather in France had turned cold. The men held one another at night to stay warm and warmed their frozen boots in the morning with flaming pieces of paper. Rumors of peace had reached all the way to the front, and Austria and Turkey were both out of the war. Still, the Hellfire Boys thrashed their way north, slogging through mud and mire with mortars for smoke and chemical attacks against the Germans as the American troops surged forward.\n\nWhen Higgie awoke again about 8 a.m. on November 11, the wan daylight barely pierced the dense fog that still lay over the forest. He pulled himself from his warm cocoon of blankets to make breakfast. The mist was so thick he couldn\u2019t see more than 10 feet away.\n\nAnd then, the lieutenant emerged like a phantom from the mist with the best news that Higgie had ever heard. At 11 a.m., the guns would fall silent. The war was over. After so much bloodshed, after seeing death visited upon the men beside him and the carnage on the battlefield around him, Higgie was taking no chances. He rolled up his pack and retreated back into the forest, just in case the peace didn\u2019t hold or it was another false rumor. It seemed to good to be true. But the armistice was real, and at 11 a.m., an eerie silence fell across the blasted landscape.\n\nWhen Higgie was finally able to write down his thoughts, there was a sense of wonderment, a tone of awe, in the diary entry that began that day. \u201cA day we will never forget,\u201d he wrote, words that a century later, should remain true today.\n\nTheo Emery is the author of Hellfire Boys: The Birth of the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service and the Race for the World\u2019s Deadliest Weapons.", "Hedge fund, VC said to buy athenahealth\n\nWith help from Mohana Ravindranath and Darius Tahir\n\nEditor's Note: This edition of Free Morning eHealth is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro eHealth subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pro's comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy tools and services, click here.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBIRDS OF PREY SETTLED ON ATHENAHEALTH?: Private equity firm Veritas Capital and hedge fund Elliott Management are buying the EHR and practice management company for $5.5 billion, according to a Reuters report Sunday night. The company will hold a conference call later today after announcing third quarter earnings Friday.\n\nAthenahealth earnings were up 9 percent from the same quarter last year, thanks in part to layoffs that were part of the restructuring that began when Elliott drove out founder Jonathan Bush and hired former General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt as chairman last spring.\n\n\u2026Expectations of the sale have raised concerns among customers, who worry that the company will lose the human element of its service, one of its main attractions, Morning eHealth\u2019s Mohana Ravindranath reports.\n\n\u2026 Athenahealth sells its software mostly to small, independent practices.

Wilkie praised the work of Pentagon and VA officials collaborating on the Cerner EHR implementation, among other projects, saying veterans\u2019 satisfaction was on the rise. \u201cWe are on the cusp of the VA\u2019s greatest transformation since Omar Bradly sat in the chair I occupy,\u201d he said. Bradley had to handle the demobilization of 11 million Americans \"with carbon paper and a telephone,\" Wilkie said. \"\u2026 No problem is insurmountable today.\u201d\n\nThe election results mean he \u201cexpects to answer more questions\u201d from House Democrats, but he feels confident about the spirit of bipartisanship in the congressional VA committees, he said.\n\nGOOGLE BUILDING HEALTH TEAM: The company has named Linus Upson, an engineering leader at life sciences subsidiary Verily, to be the interim head of its health team until Geisinger CEO David Feinberg takes over next year, CNBC reported Friday. At Verily, Upson is responsible for \"Debug,\" the company's project to curb the spread of mosquitoes that carry disease, along with a variety of other initiatives. More details here.\n\nPREAUTHS, PDMPs CAN CAUSE HARM, SAYS AMA CHIEF: At the organization\u2019s interim meeting over the weekend, president Barbara McAneny described the near disaster that befell a metastatic prostate cancer patient when she tried to increase his time-release morphine dose from two to three per day. The pharmacist in Gallup, N.M., where McAneny practices, called for the prior authorization but was denied by the health plan. Then he checked the PDMP and learned that her patient had multiple prescriptions written by McAneny and her partners. Suspecting the patient was a drug seeker, he did not notify her the prescription was denied.\n\n\u201cMy patient, a very proud man, felt shamed and didn\u2019t know what to do. So, he went home to be as tough as he felt he could be. That worked for about three days \u2026 and then he tried to kill himself.\u201d He ended up in the ER, though he survived. \"My patient nearly died of an under-dose,\u201d she said, describing the case as symptomatic of \u201cour current dysfunctional health care system.\u201d\n\nAN EHR FOR PLUMBERS: Plumbers Local 130 in Chicago recently decided to implement a Cerner EHR at a health center it\u2019s setting up for members and their families next year. \u201cLocal 130 is dedicated to building and maintaining a healthy and happy workforce, and Cerner looks forward to joining them in this important effort,\u201d said Mike Heckman, Cerner's VP for population health services.

On the Senate side, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sees $5 billion as a more realistic sum. But without concessions, Democrats are unlikely to agree to either amount.\n\nRep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said recently that lawmakers could pair wall funding with a fix for \u201cDreamers\u201d covered by the DACA program. But bipartisan negotiations along those lines floundered in the Senate back in February, and there\u2019s no reason to believe it would fly this time around. In February, the White House repeatedly torpedoed the bills with the most bipartisan support \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to imagine that dynamic changing now.\n\nThe border wall was Trump\u2019s signature promise during the 2016 campaign, but he hasn\u2019t gotten much funding yet. Congress devoted $1.7 billion to new and replacement barriers in fiscal year 2017 and 2018, according to an analysis by the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute. That\u2019s a fraction of the $18 billion the administration requested in February for a two-year period.\n\nRelated read: \u201cWhite House to press tough immigration laws, border wall in Congress\u2019s lame duck session,\u201d from McClatchy\u2019s Franco Ordo\u00f1ez and Andrea Drusch.

The ACLU filed a complaint Friday over the fast-track regulation and presidential proclamation, and later pressed the court to issue a temporary restraining order.\n\nThe regulation and proclamation cut off asylum for migrants who enter the U.S. between ports of entry. Under federal immigration law, migrants physically present in the U.S. may seek asylum whether or not they arrived at a port of entry. But the Trump administration argues that it has the authority to impose barriers to asylum \u2014 a theory that will be tested in court.\n\nThe asylum bar extends to unaccompanied minors who arrive at the border. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services guidance posted online late Friday stated that unaccompanied kids who cross the border between ports of entry will be barred from seeking asylum. A Justice Department official said precisely the opposite on a call with reporters Friday morning \u2014 that unaccompanied minors would not be subject to the ban \u2014 but a DOJ spokesman confirmed that the USCIS guidance describes the true policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSUPREME COURT\n\nSCOTUS COULD HEAR SEX DISCRIMINATION CASES: \u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court will decide as soon as Nov. 30 whether to hear a trio of closely watched discrimination cases that ask the justices to decide whether Title VII\u2019s ban on sex discrimination protects gay and transgender employees,\u201d Vin Gurrieri writes in Law360.\n\n\u201cThe dockets for the three Supreme Court cases \u2014 Altitude Express v. Zarda, Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. EEOC \u2014 were each updated on Nov. 7 with an entry stating that the justices will consider cert petitions in all three matters during its Nov. 30 conference,\u201d Gurrieri writes. SCOTUS could decide whether to take up the cases at any time after that date.\n\n\u201cAll three cases have been closely monitored throughout the employment community as speculation has run rampant in recent years that the high court would take a case that clarifies at least the sexual orientation question, which for now is the subject of a deeper circuit split than is the gender identity question,\u201d Gurrieri writes. More here.\n\nUNIONS\n\nUPS WORKERS RATIFY CONTRACT: UPS Freight workers represented by the Teamsters ratified a new five-year contract, which will avoid the prospect of a strike during the busy holiday season. The agreement, which covers roughly 11,600 workers, was approved with 77 percent in support, according to a spokeswoman for the union. UPS said the contract \u201crewards our employees for their contributions to the success of the company, while enabling UPS to remain competitive.\u201d Read more from the Atlanta Journal Constitution here.\n\nPAYOUT AFTER FIRING PRO-UNION WORKERS: \u201cA California cloud-software startup has agreed to pay 15 former employees $775,000 to resolve a dispute over the elimination of its entire non-managerial programming workforce in the U.S.,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Josh Eidelson and Hassan Kanu report. \u201cNational Labor Relations Board prosecutors in August issued a complaint accusing the company, privately held Lanetix Inc., of violating federal labor law by terminating its coders because a majority of them had petitioned to unionize.\u201d More here.\n\nMARRIOTT WORKERS END STRIKE: Hotel workers represented by Unite Here Local 19 in San Jose, Calif., approved a labor agreement that will end a 37-day strike, Martha Ross reports for the Mercury News. \u201cWorkers at the Bay Area hotels went on strike Oct. 4 to demand higher pay, more job security and smaller workloads,\u201d Ross writes. \u201cIn the Bay Area, about 12,000 Unite Here members work as housekeepers, dishwashers, servers and bartenders, cooks and bellmen at various hotels, including Marriott.\u201d More here.\n\nNLRB TO TWEAK UNION ELECTION RULES: \u201cA [NLRB] plan to change elements of its union election rules won\u2019t feature a broad reconsideration of a contentious Obama-era regulation that streamlined voting procedures,\u201d Bloomberg Law\u2019s Robert Iafolla reports. The board will issue a proposed rule sometime this winter that will address the NLRB\u2019s \u2018blocking charge\u2019 policy to pause elections if workers or unions file complaints alleging employers interfered with the elections, Bloomberg reports, citing comments by NLRB Chairman John Ring at a Nov. 8 event. More here.\n\nIN THE SENATE\n\nBUSY WEEK FOR HSGAC: The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee gets back to work this week. Here\u2019s what to expect:\n\nVote on Census nomination: The committee will vote Tuesday on the nomination of Steven Dillingham to become director of the U.S. Census. The Trump administration\u2019s decision to include a citizenship question on the 2020 Census has sparked several lawsuits amid accusations that it will depress the count in immigrant communities. The vote will take place at 5:30 p.m. in S-216. Find more info here.\n\nICE director confirmation hearing: The committee will hold a hearing Thursday over the nomination of Ronald Vitiello to become director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Vitiello, a long-time Border Patrol official, was named acting ICE director in late June following the retirement of Thomas Homan. The hearing takes place at 10 a.m. in Dirksen 342.

A DOJ spokesperson confirmed that her last day was Friday and that she accepted a new job \"a while back\" but didn't reveal details about the new role. Cutrona, who previously served as chief counsel to then-Senator Sessions on the Judiciary Committee, handled immigration issues on Trump\u2019s transition team.\n\nTRIBUNE PLANS LAYOFFS AFTER MASS SHOOTING: Tribune Publishing (the company formerly known as Tronc), told staffers last week that it will offer buyouts to employees \u2014 and partly pinned the job cuts on costs related to a June shooting at the Annapolis-based Capital Gazette, Kimberly Pierceall reports in the Virginian-Pilot.\n\nPredictably, journalists both inside and outside the company blasted the decision to link job cuts to the tragic shooting, which took the lives of five employees. \u201cThe company provided grief counseling and quickly relocated the Capital-Gazette offices, while finding and preparing a new permanent home. But to mention the costs -- and not the lives -- even just to investors -- is disgusting,\u201d tweeted Scott Dance, a reporter at the Baltimore Sun (another Tribune property).

Of the veterans identified, according to the data, more than 25,000 are already in default on their debt.\n\n\u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos earlier this year announced plans to identify and inform veterans with disabilities that they\u2019re eligible to have their federal student loans discharged. The Education Department matched its student loan records with disability records provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs \u2013 and sent customized letters explaining veterans\u2019 rights to have their loans canceled. Veterans must sign and return an application in order to obtain the loan discharge.\n\n\u2014 But veterans\u2019 groups and a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill have urged the Education Department to automatically provide the loan discharges, expressing concern about the paperwork burden, especially for veterans who are severely disabled.\n\n\u2014 The Education Department has previously said that it can\u2019t automatically forgive the loans because of the potential tax consequences of the loan discharge. The Republican tax law, H.R. 1 (115), last year removed any federal tax liability associated with loans canceled through the program. But the department reiterated in its FOIA response on Friday that it\u2019s still concerned about the \u201cpotential state tax implications\u201d associated with the loan discharges.\n\n\u2014 Veterans Education Success and several other groups sent a letter to DeVos on Friday that suggests that the state tax issues are largely overblown, urging automatic loan cancellations with an opt-out option. \u201cIt is not fair to ask severely disabled veterans to have to complete paperwork, especially given that some catastrophic disabilities will interfere with their ability to complete the paperwork,\u201d the groups wrote. Read the letter here.\n\n\u2014 Senate Democrats also sent a letter to DeVos on Friday, asking her to automatically discharge the loans. The letter, led by Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.), also urges the department to address inadvertent data errors in the process for identifying disabled veterans. Read it here.\n\nNEW HOUSE MAJORITY\n\nTOP DEMOCRAT: I WON\u2019T HAND OUT SUBPOENAS LIKE \u2018CANDY ON HALLOWEEN\u2019: The congressman likely to lead the bulk of House Democrats\u2019 investigations into President Donald Trump\u2019s administration cautioned today that he would use his subpoena powers sparingly, and work to advance issues that matter to everyday Americans, reports POLITICO\u2019s Quint Forgey. Democrats have said that oversight of the Education Department and DeVos will be a priority in the coming Congress.\n\n\u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not going to be handing out subpoenas like somebody's handing out candy on Halloween,\u201d Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) told host George Stephanopoulos on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week. \u201cIf I have to use them, they will be used in a methodical way,\u201c he said, \u201cand it must be in the public interest.\u201d Read more.\n\nREPORT: STUDENT FRAUD CLAIM PROCESSING STALLS: The Trump administration\u2019s processing of student fraud claims under the \u201cborrower defense to repayment\u201d provision of federal law has slowed further, according to The New York Times. The newspaper reported on Sunday that the Education Department does not have any employees who \u201care devoted full time to investigating\u201d student claims, citing \u201cthree people familiar with the agency\u2019s operations.\u201d More here.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE\n\nTRUMP TOUTS SCHOOL CHOICE IN PROCLAMATION FOR EDUCATION WEEK: President Donald Trump touted his administration\u2019s support for school choice policies and workforce training in a White House proclamation for \u201cAmerican Education Week,\u201d which is celebrated this week.\n\n\u2014 Trump said that his administration is \u201cprotecting and expanding parents\u2019 access to a wide range of high-quality educational choices, including effective public, charter, magnet, private, parochial, online, and homeschool options.\u201d The message added that the administration is \u201ccommitted to ensuring that America\u2019s students and workers have access to education and job training that will equip them to compete and win in the global economy.\u201d Read it here.\n\nSYLLABUS\n\n\u2014 Losses pile up at student loan refinancing company SoFi as interest rates rise: The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u2014 With Democratic wins, charter schools face a backlash in New York and other states: The New York Times.\n\n\u2014 Federal appeals court agrees that Texas owes federal government millions for special education: Texas Public Radio.\n\n\u2014 Audit finds school authorities in Utah failed to report teacher misconduct claims: The Associated Press.\n\nFollow the Pro Education team: @caitlinzemma (cemma@politico.com), @khefling (khefling@politico.com), @mstratford (mstratford@politico.com), @BenjaminEW (bwermund@politico.com), @MelLeonor_ (mleonor@politico.com) and @JaneNorman (jnorman@politico.com).", "Trump stands alone\n\nWith help from Jakob Hanke and Doug Palmer\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This edition of Morning Trade is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Trade subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pro\u2019s comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy tools and services, click here.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nON TAP TODAY: President Donald Trump seemed out of step with European allies during his trip to France. With EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m\u2019s visit to Washington later this week, European trade ministers are pushing to begin trade talks with the U.S. soon. And the number of product exclusion requests for relief from tariffs is nearing 10,000. Start here:\n\nAMONG ALLIES IN EUROPE, TRUMP STANDS ALONE: President Donald Trump is back at the White House today after spending a long weekend appearing isolated from European leaders as he continued to pursue his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, POLITICO\u2019s Nancy Cook reports from outside of Paris.\n\nNationalism denounced: French President Emmanuel Macron turned a high-profile speech commemorating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I into what appeared to be a rebuke of Trump.\n\n\u201cPatriotism is the opposite of nationalism,\u201d Macron said, as Trump sat. \u201cNationalism is a betrayal of patriotism by saying, \u2018Our interest first; who cares about the others?\u2019\u201d More on that speech in Paris here.\n\nPile on the pile-on: \u201cFrom Macron to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the message seemed clear,\u201d Nancy wrote. \u201cTrump is taking the U.S. in a more isolated direction, while former allies band together to reject him.\u201d\n\nMacron\u2019s army comment rankles Trump: Trump was also irritated that Macron suggested that Europe may need an army to defend itself against the United States, as well as other powers such as China and Russia. Trump, who inflamed relations with allies by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in the name of national security, called Macron\u2019s remark \u201cvery insulting.\u201d More here.\n\nIT\u2019S MONDAY, NOV. 12!

Their plan to avoid that: Get serious on negotiations.\n\n\"Because of the midterm elections, the trade dispute was not the top issue in the United States these last weeks, and therefore the EU has certainly won some time. But nobody knows how long this breathing pause will last,\u201d Austrian Economy Minister Margarete Schramb\u00f6ck said on Friday when she spoke during a meeting of EU trade ministers in Brussels.\n\nCrunch time: The next round comes after EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m visits Washington for a meeting Wednesday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.\n\nFinally, some deadlines: Last month, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross warned that Trump was losing his patience and complained about European delaying tactics. In response, the EU gave him a tentative timeline on Friday.\n\nSchramb\u00f6ck said the by early 2019, \u201cwe should give a strong and clear negotiation mandate to the Commission.\u201d\n\nIS AGRICULTURE IN OR OUT?: Schramb\u00f6ck said that the joint agreement Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker agreed on in July did not include the sensitive issue of agriculture.\n\n\"Agricultural goods are not included there, and therefore this is not an object of negotiation,\" Schramb\u00f6ck said. \u201cHere, we expect movement from the U.S.\u201d\n\nU.S. may have other ideas: U.S. officials continue to insist that the EU should put its entire agricultural market on the table, including by lowering tariffs on food imports and aligning non-tariff barriers. For the EU, this is politically toxic. EU leaders say the Juncker-Trump agreement mentioned only soybeans.\n\nAnother concession?: Countries are now considering extending another olive branch to Trump by increasing purchase of biofuel ingredients such as rapeseed from American farmers, our colleagues at POLITICO Pro Europe report. This could be another nugget that helps the EU keep wider agricultural talks outside of any future trade negotiation.\n\nGermany chimes in: Berlin is also warning that it\u2019s time for some real give-and-take beyond promises. \u201cI understand that the Americans want to precisely measure what they get out of these negotiations. There, we also need to deliver,\u201d said German Economic Secretary of State Ulrich Nu\u00dfbaum.\n\nNAVARRO WARNS WALL STREET: As the highly anticipated sit-down meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping approaches, China trade hawk and top White House adviser Peter Navarro is accusing Wall Street \u201cglobalist billionaires\u201d of trying to sabotage the administration\u2019s handling of the issues.\n\n\"The mission of these unregistered foreign agents \u2026 is to pressure this president into some kind of a deal,\" he said.\n\nNavarro stressed that Trump and Lighthizer were the lead negotiators for the United States on China issue \u2013 and that everyone else, including himself, should butt out.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in good hands with Donald J. Trump and Robert E. Lighthizer,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cI don\u2019t presume to get in the middle of that, and I don\u2019t think anybody else should.\u201d Doug has more here.\n\nNAVARRO SEES RISKS IN AUTO-PARTS IMPORTS: Navarro was at CSIS to talk about a recent interagency report led by the Department of Defense to examine risks to the U.S. manufacturing and defense industrial base.\n\nThe effort, which began with an executive order that Trump signed in July 2017, included 16 working groups with over 300 subject matter experts from across the federal government. Navarro said the study concluded that the greatest risks to the U.S. aren\u2019t at the level of final products, such as fully assembled cars, but rather individual components that used to make defense or industrial goods.\n\n\u201cWhat we found, in terms of the big picture punchline of that report, was almost 300 gaps and vulnerabilities in the sub-tiers of our supply chains,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cThe problems we face aren\u2019t at the assembly level, which is the final plants \u2014 whether it\u2019s in defense or it\u2019s in the auto industry. It\u2019s where do you have a vital supply chain\u201d that poses a potential risk.\n\nHinting at auto inquiry: The comment may shed light on the Commerce Department\u2019s ongoing investigation into whether imports of autos and auto parts pose a threat to national security.\n\nThat report was originally expected before last week\u2019s election, but it\u2019s not formally due until February. The timing of its release has been murky since Trump struck deals with the leaders of the EU and Japan not to impose duties on their cars as long as trade talks are making progress.\n\nCHINA TARIFF EXCLUSION REQUESTS NEAR 10,000: U.S. companies have filed close to 10,000 requests for certain products to be excluded from a 25 percent tariff that Trump imposed on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods in July, according to an updated USTR spreadsheet. Companies have also filed close to 500 requests for products to excluded from a second batch of tariffs on $16 billion worth of Chinese goods that went into effect in August.\n\nAbout 816 of requests have been denied and around 370 have been tentatively approved, subject to a final sign-off by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The others are still in either Stage 1 or Stage 2 of the review process. There is no exclusion process for the 10 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of goods that went into force on Sept. 24.\n\nFARMERS, MARK YOUR CALENDARS: The Agriculture Department is expected to announce the next round of trade aid for farmers negatively impacted by retaliatory tariffs on or around Dec. 3, a top agency official said Friday.\n\nProducers who already applied and qualified for the first $4.7 billion in direct payments will automatically be eligible for the next batch, Farm Service Agency Administrator Richard Fordyce said, adding that the application period will remain open until Jan. 15.

Although DHS and other federal agencies have said they saw no sign of such interference, the step was mandated by a September executive order. \u201cThe Director of National Intelligence will provide an assessment of any foreign interference in our elections within 45 days,\u201d Kellie Wade, a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, told ABC News in a story late last week. \u201cThis assessment will be fully coordinated within the intelligence community, and will be provided to the President and to relevant Cabinet members.\u201d\n\nBut others want yet more safeguards. \u201cI am calling on you to conduct comprehensive forensic examinations of voting machines in states where robust post-election audits are not possible because there is no paper trail,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden wrote in a letter to DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Raffi Krikorian, chief technology officer for the DNC, said Democrats also saw no sign of election interference, but, \u201cto be clear, not detecting any interference does not guarantee that it did not happen,\u201d he tweeted. \u201c@TheDemocrats tech team will remain vigilant.\u201d\n\n\u2014 DHS\u2019 BIGGEST FEAR: Nielsen has said one of the most worrisome post-election scenarios was the possibility that foreign nations would portray the midterm results as invalid, something President Donald Trump and GOP allies are now doing. Trump is suggesting corruption in states including Arizona, Florida and Georgia. Arizona\u2019s Republican secretary of state is countering the attacks, even as national GOP leaders are exasperated by GOP Senate candidate Martha McSally for not aggressively pursuing the narrative. \u201cPeople spent all this time trying to defend elections from hackers, and in reality the threat was always politicians trying to delegitimize the count,\u201d tweeted Matt Tait, a cybersecurity fellow at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nHAPPY MONDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

The pact\u2019s unveiling, which focuses on countering malware and election hacking, could come today, and will have at least 100 signatories among companies, countries and organizations. Most EU countries are on board, as are other historical U.S. allies like Canada and Australia. A U.S. company, Microsoft, helped develop it.\n\nEMS FOR CMS \u2014 Hackers may have stolen income data, tax filing statuses and immigration information in the Healthcare.gov breach, the Health and Human Services Department\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told victims in a letter last week. Additional information, as reported by CyberScoop, included other sensitive data like family relationships and whether someone was pregnant. HHS said in an internal briefing that hackers took advantage of lax privileges given to legitimate accounts. \u201cThe actors didn\u2019t break into the system using some sort of obscure hack or something else, they used the front door,\u201d acting CMS Chief Information Officer Rajiv Uppal said on the call.\n\nWOULD THIS BE PRE-RESEARCH? \u2014 If you want to help the federal government update its cybersecurity research agenda for the coming year, the comment period is now open. The National Science Foundation has published a request for information seeking input on what to include in the federal cybersecurity research and development strategic plan. The RFI, set to formally appear in the register tomorrow, offers six questions for respondents to consider, including, \u201cWhat innovative, transformational technologies have the potential to greatly enhance the security, reliability, resiliency, and trustworthiness of the digital infrastructure, and to protect consumer privacy?\u201d The government wants respondents to \u201cconsider a 10-year time frame when characterizing the challenges, prospective research activities, and desired outcomes.\u201d\n\nPROTECT PEOPLE\u2019S PRIVACY, PLEASE \u2014 Data privacy is the No. 1 issue that Americans want companies to address, above subjects like access to health care, supporting veterans and education, according to a poll out late last week. Sixty-five percent of respondents to the Harris Poll and Finn Partners survey said it was very important for companies to take action on data privacy. Only 16 percent thought they were making a very positive impact.\n\nSAMPLE PLATTER \u2014 U.S. Cyber Command late last week posted new malware to VirusTotal, a Google-owned malware intelligence repository, including samples that appear to be the handiwork of the APT28 hacking group. The U.S. intelligence community has said the group is an arm of the Russian military intelligence agency GRU.

There\u2019s a rump group of tax extenders some are hoping will be addressed, as well as retirement proposals, and Republicans would also love to fix some of the snafus in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1 (115). Of course, Republican will still be in charge, but they\u2019ll need Democrats\u2019 help to move a must-pass spending package to prevent a government shutdown.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOne basic question facing Democrats is whether they want to wait until next year to take up taxes, when they\u2019ll be running the House and in a better bargaining position, or if they\u2019d rather clear the decks now so they can get a fresh start in January. Though more than two dozen temporary provisions expired last year, lawmakers wouldn\u2019t necessarily have to deal with them now \u2014 they could wait until early next year, and still get them done in time for the 2019 filing season, though the IRS won\u2019t appreciate last-minute changes.\n\nThere are also several retirement proposals, including one by outgoing Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas), as well as a competing bipartisan plan in the Senate. And then there are the TCJA glitches, which some Democrats \u2014 remembering how Republicans blocked them from addressing Obamacare hitches \u2014 are in no hurry to fix.\n\nWhether and how lawmakers take up taxes will likely be decided by party leaders as they haggle over an \u201comnibus\u201d spending provision as well as calls to move a farm bill, to safeguard Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and, perhaps, President Donald Trump\u2019s demands to beef up security along the border with Mexico. It will also depend, veterans say, on what kind of mood rank-and-file lawmakers are in when they return (defeated members have sometimes been known to skip lame-duck sessions).\n\nBoth chambers, and both parties, will also have to restock the tax committees. The biggest changes will come on Ways and Means. Between winning the majority and losing Reps. Sandy Levin and Joe Crowley, Democrats could have around 10 slots to fill, assuming neither the size of the panel nor the ratio of majority to minority lawmakers changes (those details are yet to be decided). There is a lot of interest in joining the committee on the Democratic side \u2014 Rep. Gwen Moore has been particularly outspoken about wanting a seat.\n\nOver on the Senate side, Chuck Grassley has dibs on the Finance chairmanship, thanks to his seniority, and says he\u2019ll announce his decision this week. It\u2019s not yet clear how many seats Republicans will have to fill, though at minimum they\u2019ll replace outgoing chairman Orrin Hatch and Dean Heller, who was defeated.\n\nIT\u2019S MONDAY.

Matt Whitaker, Trump\u2019s pick to replace Jeff Sessions as attorney general, repeatedly attacked Democrats like Hillary Clinton while he was heading a tax-exempt group called the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust that was restricted from engaging in partisan politics, the Associated Press reports. \u201cHe ought not to be doing that,\u201d CharityWatch president Daniel Borochoff told the AP.

In Florida, they made it harder for lawmakers to pass tax hikes, something supported by outgoing Republican Governor Rick Scott.

In the House, Democrats are rejuvenated and Republicans are staring down the reality of at least two years in the minority wilderness. And the GOP Senate majority is looking at its last few weeks of working with a friendly bicameral partner. The top priority for everyone, ostensibly, is funding the government: lawmakers have four weeks to pass seven unfinished spending bills, including Transportation-HUD, or face a shutdown. Outside of that, here\u2019s what to watch on transportation:\n\nWill AV start?: The legislation that could make the biggest splash in our world in the next few months is the Senate\u2019s self-driving car bill, S. 1885 (115). Its bipartisan backers said negotiations were rolling along before the election, but ultimately progress sputtered to a halt in October. Now last week\u2019s midterm results have put pressure on Republicans to get the bill done; starting over and working with the Democrat-controlled House next year is not exactly an enticing proposition. And for a small group of Democrats who have held up the bill in the Senate, over concerns on safety, data privacy and liability, their party\u2019s midterm success will give them even more leverage. Our Tanya Snyder has more for Pros on the efforts to reach a compromise and the pathways to passage that the bill\u2019s sponsors are eyeing.\n\nNominations: Several nominees from our world are still waiting for a vote by the full Senate. They include Joel Szabat, tapped for assistant transportation secretary for aviation and international affairs, Diana Furchtgott-Roth for DOT\u2019s assistant secretary for research and technology, and Heidi King, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to head NHTSA. Three nominees for the Surface Transportation Board are also yet to be confirmed, as well as three prospective Amtrak board members. A caveat: floor time could be hard to come by, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has prioritized judicial nominees, of which there are dozens still outstanding.\n\nPTC deadline: Railroads have until Dec. 31 to be in compliance with federal regulations on positive train control. Several are set to come down to the wire, and while Congress doesn\u2019t have an official role for now, members will be keeping a close eye on how the railroads meet that obligation and how FRA will respond if they fail.\n\nIT\u2019S MONDAY: Thanks for tuning in to POLITICO\u2019s Morning Transportation, your daily tipsheet on all things trains, planes, automobiles and ports.

Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and incoming Transportation Committee Chairman Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) are holding a meeting with transportation stakeholders Friday to plan for the new Congress. \"The majority of newly-elected members are extraordinarily sympathetic to the needs of rebuilding our failing infrastructure,\" Blumenauer wrote in an invitation obtained by MT, which also touted the defeat of a California ballot measure to repeal a gas tax increase. Blumenauer also said that the two are making \"extraordinary progress\" on the effort to create an infrastructure subcommittee on Ways and Means.\n\nTHIS WEEK: NTSB is holding an investigative hearing on the high-profile engine failure of a Southwest Airlines flight in April, which caused the first fatality on a U.S. passenger airline in a decade. The Wednesday meeting will focus on the design, development history and inspection of the fan blade used in the CFM International engine.\n\nAlso: The Coast Guard reauthorization bill gets a Senate floor vote Tuesday. Disagreements over contentious ballast water discharges language tanked the bill when it came up for a floor vote earlier this year, but senators were hashing out a new bipartisan agreement prior to the midterms.\n\n** A message from PlanetM \u2013 Michigan, where big ideas in mobility are born: When it comes to mobility, safety is no accident in Michigan.

Visit PlanetM.com **\n\nMIDTERM UPDATE: The Florida saga continues, with Senate Commerce ranking member Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) locked in an ever-evolving legal and rhetorical battle with his opponent, Republican Gov. Rick Scott. A recount is still ongoing, and it could be days or weeks before the contest is settled. In California, House Transportation Committee member Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) is also still waiting for votes to be counted in his race against Democrat Josh Harder, but he has fallen behind in the last few days. Both elections have consequences for their committees\u2019 leadership: if Nelson loses, a new Democrat will have to step up on Senate Commerce, and Denham is hoping to vie for the ranking member position on House Transportation.\n\nICYMI: There\u2019s a chance that Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), who\u2019s next in line in seniority on Commerce, would give up her ranking member spot on Senate Energy in order to lead Dems on Commerce. Rumors are swirling that she\u2019s interested in making the switch, according to POLITICO\u2019s Morning Energy.\n\nAviation\n\nDRONE OVERLOAD: FAA is struggling to manage the volume of requests to waive restrictions on drone operations, DOT\u2019s inspector general said Friday. The agency has rejected 73 percent of requests for waivers to the visual line of sight and operation over people rules, and is \u201cfinding it hard to get the information it needs and to communicate with applicants,\u201d Tanya writes.\n\nMORE FROM THE IG: It was a busy Friday for DOT\u2019s internal watchdog, which also found that vulnerabilities remain with FAA\u2019s En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) system, used by air traffic controllers to manage more than 3 million high-altitude, en-route planes each month. FAA has taken corrective action to address the seven ERAM failures since 2014 -- one of which, in 2015, shut down the FAA\u2019s Washington center for hours and affected thousand of flights over several days. But other issues are still unresolved, the IG said. Among them: FAA has not implemented annual testing of ERAM\u2019s contingency plan. Also, the agency is planning to decommission the current ERAM backup system without determining whether future outages can be prevented without it.\n\nSecurity\n\nTSA DRAWS CONCLUSION ON SEA-TAC: TSA said Friday that it found no evidence of airline or airport misconduct in the theft and crash of a Horizon Air plane at Seattle Tacoma International Airport in August. But the agency is still calling for an industry-wide security ramp up in response, our Stephanie Beasley reports.

The House Ag leaders are sitting down today to start what could be the final stretch of talks. MA has new details of potential compromise measures on conservation and commodity policy.\n\n\u2014 Meatpacking line speeds? Agency relocations? Trade aid? Those issues and more are on the list of USDA-focused oversight areas that House Democrats could probe next year.\n\n\u2014 The incoming class of farm-state lawmakers includes some potential rising stars on both sides of the aisle. MA looks at six freshmen to watch.\n\n\u2014 U.S. and Chinese trade and foreign policy officials gave different forecasts for resolving trade disputes between the superpowers, whose presidents are set to meet face-to-face at the end of the month. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro had some choice words for Wall Street \u201cglobalist billionaires\u201d looking to influence trade talks.\n\nCONAWAY, PETERSON MEETING TODAY ON FARM BILL: The current and next House Agriculture Committee chairs plan to huddle today, despite the federal holiday, as they kick off what could be the final stretch of farm bill negotiations. Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) and ranking member Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) \u2014 who\u2019s set to take the gavel in January \u2014 have some key decisions to make.\n\nA path to compromise? Staff members from both chambers have come up with some options for resolving disagreements in the commodity title of the bill, four sources familiar with the talks told Pro Ag\u2019s Catherine Boudreau. The committees are looking at ways to expand the number of farmers eligible for updating their crop yields, because the House bill, H.R. 2 (115), would concentrate that benefit to producers, primarily in the Southwest, whose crops were damaged from the 2012 drought.\n\nThe yields that farmers report to USDA (as well as crop prices, their historically planted crops, and acreage) factor into the amount of subsidies they receive from the Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage programs. For that reason, Senate leaders weren\u2019t too happy about an update applying to only a small region of the country.\n\nConaway, in order to offset the hundreds of millions of dollars in extra costs associated with allowing a yield update, proposed that farmers could no longer receive payments on acres that hadn\u2019t been planted with crops eligible for government programs in the past nine years. Senate Agriculture leaders contend producers should be compensated for that loss, so farm bill negotiators are looking at providing some transition assistance, or giving farmers the chance to enroll those acres into a conservation program.\n\nClosing in on conservation: Another hurdle to a final farm bill is reconciling the House proposal to eliminate the Conservation Stewardship Program and fold it into another working-lands initiative, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, with the Senate plan to maintain both and at a higher level of funding.\n\n\u2014 A solution being floated involves cutting funding for CSP and shifting more money toward EQIP, though both programs would stay intact, sources familiar with the talks told Pro Ag\u2019s Liz Crampton. (The sources cautioned that nothing is final yet.)\n\nPros, Catherine has the rundown on farm bill compromise options here.\n\nHemp is in: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Kentucky reporters that a Senate farm bill provision legalizing hemp as an agricultural commodity will be in the final legislation. (The Hill has more here.)\n\nHAPPY MONDAY, NOV. 12! Welcome to Morning Ag, where your host\u2019s alma mater is officially headed to the Big Ten championship game after beating Iowa this weekend! Go \u2018Cats. As always, news and tips go to rmccrimmon@politico.com and @ryanmccrimmon. And follow the whole team @Morning_Ag.\n\nJoin POLITICO on Nov. 14 for special editorial conversations at \u201cThe Salute to Military Spouses,\u201d a half-day summit to raise awareness of the challenges and contributions of these unsung heroes. Journalists from POLITICO, the exclusive media partner of the summit, will provide firsthand insight and intelligence on timely political and policy issues facing the military and military spouses. RSVP here.\n\nDEMOCRATS\u2019 AG OVERSIGHT AGENDA: When Democrats take control of the House in January, oversight of the Trump administration will be near the top of their agenda. For the House Agriculture Committee (and the Appropriations subcommittee that oversees Agriculture Department funding), that means ramped up scrutiny of USDA on everything from relocating research agencies to doling out trade aid and granting poultry line speed waivers.\n\nMeatpacking line speeds: Shortly before Election Day, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) reiterated a request for USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service to provide monthly updates \u201cthrough February 2019\u201d on waiver requests from poultry plants seeking permission to process more than 140 birds per minute, the current limit, POLITICO\u2019s Sarah Zimmerman writes.\n\n\u2014 USDA is also moving toward scrapping the limit on pork processing line speeds, despite opposition from food safety and labor groups who warn that faster line speeds will cause additional workplace injuries.\n\nTrade aid: The department plans to announce around Dec. 3 details for a second batch of direct payments to U.S. producers stung by retaliatory tariffs, Catherine reports. The second round of trade aid could bring more complaints from commodity groups unhappy with their slice of the pie \u2014 and more questions from lawmakers about how USDA came up with its formula for determining aid.\n\nOne more for your radar: NBC reports that House Democrats have a list of dozens of stalled oversight efforts that they\u2019re seeking to revive next year \u2014 including looking into communications between USDA and \u201ccorporate lobbyists.\u201d\n\n6 FARM-STATE FRESHMEN TO WATCH: The shifting House landscape is likely to have less impact on agriculture and rural issues than other policy areas. But new Democratic members will likely want to move the ball on campaign priorities like rural broadband and medical access in rural areas, along with helping farmers and ranchers burned by President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war. Under next year\u2019s divided Congress, there\u2019s potential for bipartisan cooperation in those areas.\n\nYour host looked into the farm agendas of six incoming members from Iowa, Minnesota and South Dakota, who could help shape the ag debate for the next two years \u2014 and maybe even influence debate on the House Ag Committee itself if they make the panel. The list also includes some possible rising stars in each party:\n\n\u2014 Iowa Democrat Abby Finkenauer, 29, will be the second youngest woman ever elected to Congress. Finkenauer made hay on the campaign trail out of Trump\u2019s trade war, and her approach could be an indicator of how heartland Democrats handle the issue now that they\u2019re in the majority. Trade issues don\u2019t always fall along partisan lines, but the repercussions of Trump\u2019s policies will be all the more important when the 2020 campaign for the White House ramps up, with the Midwest likely to be a decisive battleground in the race.\n\n\u2014 Minnesota Republican Pete Stauber was one of the only GOP candidates this cycle to flip a Democratic House district. He was identified early as a bright spot for Republicans when Trump and Vice President Mike Pence both campaigned for the former minor league hockey player and Duluth police officer. The president\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs are popular in Stauber\u2019s rural district (currently represented by retiring Democratic Rep. Rick Nolan), where metals mining is a major industry.\n\n\u2014 Minnesota Democrat Angie Craig has strong ag policy chops, according to Peterson, who said Craig was one of the \u201cbest prepared\u201d and \u201cmost knowledgeable\u201d candidates at the state\u2019s Farmfest forum in August.\n\nPros, check out the rest of the list of farm-state freshmen to watch.\n\nMIXED SIGNALS ON CHINA TRADE: With Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping set to meet on the sidelines of the upcoming G20 gathering in Buenos Aires, a top Chinese official expressed optimism about resolving the current trade tension \u2014 while Trump\u2019s trade adviser tamped down expectations of fruitful talks and even blamed Wall Street \u201cglobalist billionaires\u201d for trying to sabotage the White House\u2019s trade strategy.\n\n\u201cThe game that China has played \u2014 and it played people in the Bush administration like a violin \u2014 is to do a tap dance and economic dialogue,\u201d White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said Friday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\u2014 Navarro also blasted the \u201cshuttle diplomacy that is now going on by a self-appointed group of Wall Street bankers and hedge fund managers between the U.S. and China,\u201d Pro Trade\u2019s Doug Palmer reports. He called those back-channel talks \u201cpart of the Chinese government influence operations.\u201d\n\nYang Jiechi, foreign affairs director for China\u2019s Communist Party, sounded far more positive after meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \u201cThe door to negotiation remains open, and let\u2019s not forget how our two sides have successfully navigated through previous rough patches in our economic and trade relations,\u201d he said during a press conference.

Jason Lewis singled out former Sen. John McCain for his vote against legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare as an unnecessary attempt to slight President Donald Trump. | AP Photo/Andy Clayton-King Congress Defeated GOP congressman blames McCain's Obamacare vote for Democrats' House takeover\n\nAn outgoing Republican lawmaker on Sunday blamed former Sen. John McCain for the GOP's loss of the House majority in last week's elections, writing in The Wall Street Journal that it was McCain's decisive vote against legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare that led to a wave of Democratic midterm victories.\n\nJason Lewis, a Minnesota congressman who was unseated last Tuesday by Democrat Angie Craig, claimed in his op-ed that McCain\u2019s thumbs-down vote against a so-called skinny repeal of the Affordable Care Act \u201cprompted a \u2018green wave\u2019 of liberal special-interest money\u201d that he said allowed Democrats to hammer Republicans on the issue of pre-existing conditions.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nRepeal-and-replace efforts began in 2017 in the House, which passed the American Health Care Act as replacement legislation for Obamacare. But amid tense negotiations, Republicans in the Senate instead put to a vote what they referred to as a \"skinny\" Obamacare repeal, which would have gutted controversial provisions of Obamacare like the individual mandate while maintaining other aspects of the law. McCain, along with Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), voted against the measure, sinking it.\n\nLewis wrote in his op-ed that the failed Senate vote allowed Democrats to campaign against Republicans with the claim that the GOP wanted to remove protections for those with pre-existing conditions, a keystone of many Democratic campaigns leading up to the midterms.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

PolitFact has rated claims that the House bill wouldn\u2019t eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions as \u201cmostly false.\u201d\n\nAlthough McCain was one of three GOP lawmakers to vote against the \"skinny\" repeal, Lewis singled out McCain for his \"no\" vote \u2014 which came after he criticized Republicans for trying to push a repeal bill through and called for the return of regular order \u2014 as an unnecessary attempt to slight President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe late Arizona senator\u2019s grievance with all things Trump was well known, but this obsession on the part of \u2018Never Trump\u2019 Republicans has to end,\u201d Lewis wrote. \u201cDisapprove of the president\u2019s style if you like, but don\u2019t sacrifice sound policy to pettiness.\u201d", "TRUMP ATTACKS as FIRES RAGE -- BROWN warns climate change deniers contribute to 'tragedy' -- ROUDA unseats ROHRABACHER -- PELOSI: I will be speaker -- McCARTHY: 'GOP will win back majority'\n\nTHE BUZZ: Gov.

Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201d\n\n-- Asked to respond to the President's tweet Sunday, Brown called California's recent battles with massive wildfires \"the new abnormal.'' He added: \u201cScientists and the engineers and the firefighters all tell us forest management is one element\u2019\u2019 to control them, but warned governments must address \u201ca whole range of actions'' to address a problem he said may cost \"billions\" of dollars to tackle.\n\n-- \u201cManaging all the forests everywhere we can does not stop climate change -- and those that deny that are definitely contributing to the tragedy,\u2019\u2019 Brown said. \u201cThe chickens are coming home to roost.

They will see her now as strong, partisan, left-leaning and all-Democrat \u2014 the one with the guts, experience and steely-eyed determination to defeat Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nPenn and Stein offer a scathing criticism of other expected Democratic candidates, writing that Clinton \u201cwill not allow this humiliating loss at the hands of an amateur to end the story of her career,\u201d and that while another run would likely infuriate Senate Democrats looking to take control of the party with a 2020 run, the two authors wrote that White House hopefuls in the chamber fumbled moments like the Kavanaugh confirmation as if they were \u201cbumbling amateurs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can expect her to run for president once again. Maybe not at first, when the legions of Senate Democrats make their announcements, but definitely by the time the primaries are in full swing,\u201d they predicted.\n\nNews that Clinton might try to take on President Donald Trump again elicited cheers from the White House.

But anti-Pelosi Democrats are prioritizing stopping Pelosi from becoming speaker over finding a replacement. \u201cEven if no one steps up immediately, some rebels believe they can still push out Pelosi,\u201d Rachael and Bres report.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThe question surrounding Pelosi\u2019s future is the only cloud over what was a hugely successful election for House Democrats,\u201d they continue. \u201cOn one hand there\u2019s a cast of incoming Democratic freshmen who ran on change, in some cases starting with Pelosi; on the other, there is no potential replacement with anything approaching the seasoning or legislative savvy the 78-year-old Californian possesses, making it hard to see how she won\u2019t be speaker again.\u201d Much more: https://politi.co/2ROAcpT\n\nRelated: \u201cNancy Pelosi: Mueller Doesn\u2019t Have to Indict Trump for Congress to Impeach Him,\u201d by The Atlantic\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere: http://bit.ly/2DggJu9\n\nLEADERSHIP WATCH -- House Democrats have another two and a half weeks to settle on their leaders for the next Congress. But Republicans in the House and Senate will make their decisions this week. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) is expected to become minority leader, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) serving under him as minority whip. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) is likely to become House GOP Conference chair, and Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.) is running for vice chair unopposed. Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) is running to succeed outgoing NRCC Chairman Steve Stivers (R-Ohio). Emmer is backed by Rep. Mimi Walters (R-Calif.), a fellow NRCC deputy chair.\n\nIn the Senate, only one position appears to have a race. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will continue to lead Republicans. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), however, is expected to succeed term-limited Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) as majority whip. That likely leaves Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) as Republican Conference chair and Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) as Republican Policy Committee chair, \u201cwhich produces policy briefs and research for GOP offices,\u201d Roll Call\u2019s Lindsey McPherson notes. Sen.

Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) to succeed Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.). In the House, no one is challenging Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) for majority leader, but Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.) is facing Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) for majority whip. Reps.

Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said Whitaker\u2019s only qualification is \u201cthat the president wants him to be the hatchet man to destroy the Mueller investigation.\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) added that Democrats will find out whether Whitaker has any involvement in the Russia probe, whether he has made any commitments to the president about it, whether he\u2019s serving as a back channel to the president or his legal team and whether he\u2019s doing anything to interfere with the investigation.\n\nNadler and Schiff will likely serve as the Judiciary and Intelligence Committee chairmen in the next Congress. DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Whitaker is \u201cwell qualified\u201d and someone Deputy Attorney General described as a \u201csuper choice\u201d last week. \u201cHe has the confidence of the President, Department of Justice leadership and key leaders in Congress,\u201d Kupec said in a statement.

The Illinois Democrat is also in line to become what\u2019s known as a \u2018cardinal\u2018 in D.C. \u2014 he\u2019s slated to become chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government, one of the 12 subcommittees of the influential Appropriations Committee.\n\nAfter Sessions previously refused to answer questions, Quigley wants him to answer whether the president tried to impair the investigation.\n\nThe former Chicago criminal defense attorney notes he\u2019s part of \u201cthe most important investigation of our lifetime\u2014and I lived through Watergate!\u201d Recalling how Watergate escalated from \u201cthird-rate burglary\u201d to conspiracy and obstruction of justice, Quigley says the \u201cstakes are higher\u201d in the Russia scandal. \u201cRussia hacked the democratic process and there\u2019s a heck of a lot of evidence that the president and his minions cooperated with them to do that.\u201d\n\nIf Watergate is algebra, says Quigley, \u201cthis is calculus. It\u2019s one thing to subpoena John Dean. It\u2019s another thing to subpoena a Russian oligarch.\u201d\n\nMORE BUZZ\n\nIllinois Democrats\u2019 takeover of every level of government has the Illinois Republican Party is taking stock on how to shift gears. The way Pat Brady sees it, the Illinois GOP needs an \u201cautopsy\u201d similar to what the national GOP underwent in 2012 when Mitt Romney lost to President Barack Obama. \u201cWe need to get back to the party of Reagan, a party that appeals to a broad spectrum,\u201d he told POLITICO.\n\nThat would mean having to pull back from the politics of Dick Uihlein, the business magnate who supported conservatives across the country during this past election season, including Alabama Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore\u2014who was accused of sexually assaulting teens when he was in his 30s. Uihlein lives in Wisconsin but has been an influence on GOP politics in Illinois, funneling $8.5 million to the Liberty Principles PAC and to conservative gubernatorial candidate Jeanne Ives (who lost to Bruce Rauner in the primary).\n\nBrady and others say the Illinois GOP would do better to stop focusing on social issues like gay marriage, especially as more young people and women get involved in the voting process.\n\nGOP state Rep. Dave McSweeney also points to the missteps of Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. \u201c We have a massive tax hike, out of control spending, a big unpaid backlog of bills\u2014and we have fewer Republican General Assembly members,\u201d he told POLITICO. \u201cWe\u2019re worse off than when he came in.\u201d\n\nMcSweeney says Republicans need to follow Democrats\u2019 political tactics: Run a grassroots GOTV campaign. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a policy victory,\u201d he said, referring to J.B. Pritzker\u2019s rout over Rauner. \u201cPritzker ran on a vague platform. What he and Democrats did was get out the vote.\u201d\n\nWelcome to POLITICO\u2019s Illinois Playbook.

Livio: \u201cThe kids started getting sick on an unseasonably warm day in late September. Yet it would not be until Oct. 9 -- and after the death of two children -- when the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation notified the state Health Department of a viral outbreak inside the long-term care facility in northern New Jersey. And then another 12 days before state inspectors walked in the door. The devastating adenovirus outbreak at the Wanaque Center in Haskell has so far led to the deaths of 10 children and infected 19 more \u2026 an examination of how the outbreak unfolded and spread rapidly has raised questions over why state health officials waited two weeks before deploying a team to see for themselves how Wanaque was managing the crisis. The state's response will be part of what the state Senate Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee will examine when it holds a hearing on Dec. 3 to discuss the outbreak, said Sen. Joseph Vitale, the committee chairman said.\u201d Read the report\n\nTHIS LOOKS ABOUT AS NON-DESPERATE AS I\u2019M BEING NON-SARCASTIC \u2014 \u201cNewark, state officials reaching out to NYC, Amazon in hopes of still getting piece of HQ2,\u201d by ROI-NJ\u2019s Anjalee Khemlani: \u201cNewark and state officials are not willing to give up on their bid for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, and are proactively getting that message out \u2014 by reaching out to both New York City and Amazon officials to indicate they would like to collaborate on the massive project, four sources told ROI-NJ \u2026 One source said a Newark official has reached out to New York City in an effort to talk about how the two areas could work together.

On Friday, New Jersey's attorney general said a lengthy independent investigation into how the case went sideways was finished. Mistakes were made, authorities acknowledged. What mistakes? They weren't saying. Still, the case could lead to significant reforms in how prosecutors in the Garden State handle wrongful conviction claims, according to a copy of a letter sent by Attorney General Gurbir Grewal to New Jersey's 21 county prosecutors, a copy of which was obtained from his office by NJ Advance Media.

But there\u2019s still roughly $300,000 of debt he\u2019s said is \u201crelated to some non-governmental work reviewed during the investigation.\u201d\n\nAll of which means the mayor, who is term-limited out of office in 2021, may once again find himself filling his free time, or his Friday afternoons, at Bar Toto, where he\u2019s been known to plot his campaign moves and fundraising calls. The Legal Defense Fund wouldn\u2019t be de Blasio\u2019s only fundraising enterprise \u2014 he\u2019s also got a new federal Political Action Committee, which he rolled out in July this year, to help pay for he and his wife\u2019s travel and raise money for his favored political candidates. He\u2019s got to pay off his legal bills, but is he also trying to stay connected to the donor class for the purposes of running for ... something else?\n\nWhen asked if he\u2019s planning to run for president in 2020, the mayor said Friday in his weekly radio interview with WNYC\u2019s Brian Lehrer that \u201cI intend to continue in elected office if there is an opportunity to do so, but my focus is on being mayor of the city for the next three years and two months.\u201d\n\nIT\u2019S MONDAY.

The law required the Democratic challenger to Republican Rep. Chris Collins of Clarence to file a report spelling out his finances by May 15. In fact, he never did it until August. A campaign consultant, Robert Dempsey, said he urged him to file it back in the spring. And before long, McMurray stopped answering Dempsey's emails and texts. \u2018He went dark on me,\u2019 recalled Dempsey, a Buffalo native... In its 11 months of existence, the McMurray campaign employed four campaign managers and at least 17 consultants performing various tasks, federal records show. People intimately familiar with McMurray's effort said political pros came and left, sometimes voluntarily and sometimes not. Many left frustrated with the candidate's reluctance to raise money, stick to a schedule and take advice.

The aide slams the boy\u2019s head into a metal grate and then, still gripping the boy\u2019s neck, he pushes him into an entranceway and against a wall...The assault, captured in 2014 by surveillance cameras at Highland Residential Center, a juvenile prison in Ulster County, lasts 17 seconds...The Highland attack was rare in having been captured on camera, but it was far from an isolated case. Before the attack, other instances of nonfatal strangulation had been reported at New York State\u2019s residential centers for those with special needs\u2026\n\nPatricia Gunning, who prosecuted the Highland case, detected the distressing pattern.

Over the course of nine months in 2016, the strangulation project hit a wall, leaving the scope of the problem unknown and bringing to a halt several initiatives Gunning was working on...Gunning said she believes that state officials were worried about \u201cthe optics\u201d of devoting resources and attention to so sensitive and disturbing a subject. \u2018Nobody, in my opinion, wanted to say this was happening on the state\u2019s watch,\u2019 she said.\n\nThe initiative ran aground at a time when all but a handful of states had made nonfatal strangulation a felony, recognizing its prevalence in domestic abuse.\u201d Newsday\u2019s Will Van Sant\n\nYOUR NEW, NEW YORK STATE SENATE:\n\nCHANGING CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS \u2014 Advocates for campaign finance reform are planning a renewed push when the new Legislature convenes in January, hoping that the incoming Democratic majority in the Senate will give new impetus to reform efforts...The Republicans who have controlled the Senate for the past eight years have recently been the most vocal proponents of campaign finance changes like a ban on pay-to-play.

Several sources familiar with the negotiations...say the state is planning to create a general project plan to rezone the roughly 20-acre site, which today can only accommodate low-rise manufacturing uses. That would give the state the authority to remake the area without having to secure approval from the City Council, which usually holds power over major development projects in need of a rezoning. The general project plan still requires an environmental review, allows the community to comment in a public forum and is subject to nonbinding input from the City Planning Commission and the local community board.\u201d Crain's Daniel Geiger\n\n\u2014 \u201cThis tax break could be worth up to nearly $1B for Amazon\u201d \u2014 \u201cOfficials have kept quiet any economic incentives they\u2019re offering Amazon to move part of its second headquarters to Long Island City. But there\u2019s one benefit already on the table that could be worth up to nearly $1 billion for the e-commerce giant. By opening an office in Queens and hiring new employees, Amazon would automatically qualify for the Relocation and Employment Assistance Program, which offers companies a tax credit for each employee they hire at a new office in the outer boroughs and parts of Upper Manhattan. The program gives companies a tax credit of $3,000 per employee for 12 years, which means if Amazon were to hire 25,000 employees, the company\u2019s REAP benefits would total $900 million over that time period.\u201d The Real Deal\u2019s Rich Bockmann\n\nMAKING THE GRADE: \u201cNew York City officials say food carts and trucks will soon receive letter grades similar to the grades given to city restaurants.

Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, incoming chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said on ABC he wants to look into whether Trump is acting in his own interests rather than those of the American people. New York Rep. Jerry Nadler told CNN his first moves as House Judiciary Committee chairman are to protect the Mueller investigation and look into Trump's shakeup in the attorney general's office. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, confident she'll be elected Speaker, told The Atlantic transgressions special counsel Robert Mueller doesn't find worthy of an indictment could be worthy of impeachment.\n\nAnd as longtime Massachusetts Rep. Richard Neal prepares to take his likely role as head of the House Ways and Means Committee, he told reporters last week the committee has its eye on the president's tax returns. Neal is among the members of the upcoming Congress who were in office during one of the memorable investigations into a president in modern American history \u2014 Neal is one of some 100 lawmakers who were on Capitol Hill during the Clinton impeachment proceedings and now for the Trump era.\n\nNeal slammed the impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton on the House floor in December 1998, and his message decrying partisanship and party-line votes is similar to what we hear today from Republicans.\n\n\"What we have seen in this Congress really is the occurrence of 2 things: One, the rise of the Intimidator Caucus on the Republican side where they have intimidated moderate Republicans into voting for this impeachment proceeding,\" Neal said in 1998. \"Secondly, we ask ourselves tonight, whatever happened to moderate Republicans?\"\n\nAt that time, it was fresh off the 1998 midterms and Republicans had a narrow majority but failed to pick up any seats in the House \u2014 the first time since 1934 that a non-presidential party hadn't gained seats in a midterm year. Many saw the election as a referendum on the West Wing as the Lewinsky scandal drove headlines.

But so far, no one\u2019s stepped up as an alternative, and it\u2019s unclear who might. Also unknown is whether that person would have a prayer against the experienced Pelosi, as flawed as her detractors say she is.\n\n\u201cPelosi is acting like the next speaker already, and any effort to replace her faces immense obstacles without a viable alternative, said Democratic lawmakers and aides. \u2018In politics, nobody is perfect, including Nancy Pelosi. But the basic rule is you can\u2019t beat somebody with nobody,\u2019 said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who backs the California Democrat. \u2018That\u2019s the problem with Nancy\u2019s skeptics.\u2019 \u2026 In 2016, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) waited almost two weeks after the GOP crushed House Democrats to declare his bid against her. \u2026\n\n\u201c\u2018The idea that you can\u2019t beat someday with nobody isn\u2019t true when you have a minimum threshold to meet,\u2019 said Rep.

But the Senate leader also issued a dire warning: Democrats had just thumped them in the all-important online donor game, and the GOP badly needs to catch up.\n\n\u201cThe heart of the problem, McConnell said at the event at party headquarters on Capitol Hill, is ActBlue. The Democratic fundraising tool funneled over $700 million in small donations to House and Senate candidates over the course of the 2018 campaign. The GOP leader said Republicans were getting swamped in the hunt for online givers and that he\u2019d charged his political team with coming up with a solution to enable them to compete in 2020.\n\n\u201cMcConnell\u2019s push underscores the urgency confronting Republicans. In race after race, turbocharged liberal donors pumped cash into Democratic coffers \u2014 much of it through ActBlue, an easy-to-use site that allows givers to plug in their credit card information and send contributions to their candidate of choice with a click.

He delivers speeches that contain insults and falsehoods. He announces policies on a whim, some constitutionally questionable.\n\n\u201cBut on a trip to Europe, the president hardly said a word \u2014 and he still managed to outrage at almost every turn. Aside from a critical tweet aimed at French President Emmanuel Macron when Trump landed in Paris late Friday \u2014 one based on an inaccurate newspaper summary of an interview Macron gave suggesting that he had called the United States a threat \u2014 Trump didn\u2019t throw any sharp elbows at his peers here.\n\n\u201cIt was still all about him.

His donation sparked a backlash from his colleagues.\n\n\u201cSix months later, he was out. Neither Facebook nor Mr. Luckey has ever said why he left the social-media giant. When testifying before Congress about data privacy earlier this year, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg denied the departure had anything to do with politics. Mr. Luckey, it turns out, was put on leave, then fired, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cMore recently, he has told people the reason was his support for Donald Trump and the furor that his political beliefs sparked within Facebook and Silicon Valley, some of those people say. Internal Facebook emails suggest the matter was discussed at the highest levels of the company. In the fall of 2016, as unhappiness over the donation simmered, Facebook executives including Mr. Zuckerberg pressured Mr. Luckey to publicly voice support for libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, despite Mr. Luckey\u2019s yearslong support of Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the conversations and internal emails viewed by The Wall Street Journal.\u201d WSJ\n\n-- LUCKEY\u2019s full statement on the matter: \u201cThis is all in the past for me.

Rodney Davis' fundraising was outpaced by more than two-to-one from July to September, wiping out his early money advantage. | Jeff Roberson/AP Photo Elections Money troubles: The GOP\u2019s problem with cash The gaping cash disparity in the midterms has Republicans worried about 2020.\n\nMitch McConnell stood before a roomful of Republican donors on Wednesday night to thank them for their help in the midterms. But the Senate leader also issued a dire warning: Democrats had just thumped them in the all-important online donor game, and the GOP badly needs to catch up.\n\nThe heart of the problem, McConnell said at the event at party headquarters on Capitol Hill, is ActBlue. The Democratic fundraising tool funneled over $700 million in small donations to House and Senate candidates over the course of the 2018 campaign. The GOP leader said Republicans were getting swamped in the hunt for online givers and that he has charged his political team with coming up with a solution to enable them to compete in 2020.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMcConnell\u2019s push underscores the urgency confronting Republicans. In race after race, turbocharged liberal donors pumped cash into Democratic coffers \u2014 much of it through ActBlue, an easy-to-use site that allows givers to plug in their credit card information and send contributions to their candidate of choice with a click. Republicans have no such centralized fundraising platform.\n\nWith the next campaign already on the horizon, Republicans view their online donor deficit \u2014 particularly acute in House races, but significant in Senate contests, too \u2014 as a primary obstacle. Josh Holmes, a top McConnell political adviser, has begun making calls to senior Republicans, and a group of party figures is expected to convene after Thanksgiving. An ActBlue counterweight, he said, would require buy-in across the splintered Republican Party apparatus.\n\nRepublicans have long acknowledged the shortcoming and spoken out about the need to fix it, to no avail. But this year's gaping money disparity between the two parties has snapped the GOP to attention.\n\n\u201cI think everybody acknowledges we have a helluva problem,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThe question is whether we can get everybody to set egos and business considerations aside to solve it. I\u2019d certainly like to try.\u201d\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

During the third quarter, 92 House GOP incumbents collected less money than their Democratic challengers, and 51 of those Republicans raised less than half the amount taken in by their rivals.\n\nThe fundraising challenge imperiled Republicans across the map. In Illinois, GOP Rep. Rodney Davis, who was once thought to be safe, was outpaced more than 2-to-1 from July through September, wiping out his early money advantage. Davis managed to hang on, but only barely.\n\nSomething \u201chas to be done to combat what the Democrats put together,\" the three-term congressman told POLITICO. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why small-dollar GOP donors in Wyoming, Texas, Montana, or Florida can\u2019t help vulnerable members in tough districts.\"\n\nRepublican Senate candidates, meanwhile, were outraised in nearly every key race \u2014 and in some states, such as Montana and Nevada, the deficits were glaring.\n\nThe thirst for an ActBlue-like platform has become a central point of discussion as Republicans plot out a road map to win back the House majority and select their new leadership. During a House Republican conference call on Thursday, Arkansas Rep. French Hill complained that the party didn\u2019t raise enough small donations and should have its own version of ActBlue. Hill, who fended off a stiff challenge despite being outraised in the third quarter, said he would support only a candidate to lead the House GOP campaign arm who is committed to creating such a platform.\n\nRep. Mimi Walters (R-Calif.), who is locked in a close race for reelection that has yet to be called, said she has had conversations with an array of House lawmakers since last week\u2019s elections and found widespread agreement that the party needs to address its online donor problem.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very concerned about being able to compete with ActBlue, and it has to be a top priority,\u201d she said.\n\nAmong the lessons Republicans say they learned this year is that the party can no longer just rely on a few billionaire megadonors like Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson. He and his wife, Miriam, contributed over $100 million to GOP-aligned super PACs over the course of the campaign.\n\nWhile the 85-year-old Adelson remains a crucial source of funding, Republicans concede their advantage in billionaire giving has narrowed considerably. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and San Francisco hedge-fund manager Tom Steyer each plowed more than $100 million into campaigns for Democrats, investments that stretched the 2018 map and put Republicans on defense in races once thought to be beyond reach for the opposing party.\n\nJust as important, Republicans say they\u2019ve come to fully recognize the limitations of billionaire-funded outside groups. Because super PACs must pay a higher rate to air TV commercials than individual candidates, those candidate-raised dollars go further.\n\nDemocrats, who\u2019ve come to see ActBlue as the secret weapon that powered their House takeover, express skepticism that Republicans will succeed in creating a rival.\n\n\u201cRepublicans have tried to build a long-lasting small-dollar giving platform before but have never really been able to do it,\u201d said Caleb Cade, an ActBlue spokesman. \u201cThey've relied for so long on money from the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson that they have not invested the necessary time and energy to create sustainable infrastructure that powers small-dollar giving. I'm not so sure they'll be able to close that gap in just one cycle, if ever.\u201d\n\nRepublicans concede that establishing their own platform won\u2019t be easy. In 2017, National Republican Congressional Committee officials quietly undertook a project to examine how ActBlue functioned and whether it could be replicated. ActBlue fundraising became a constant topic of discussion in committee meetings, but the team determined that reproducing it would be difficult in a short period of time.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Republicans have several online fundraising platforms, including Revv, Victory Passport and Anedot. Yet the party has not consolidated around any of them the way Democrats have with ActBlue, which boasts that it has raised over $3 billion since its founding in 2004.\n\nHolmes said is interested not in creating a new platform but, rather, in getting Republicans to work together in a way that replicates the centralized nature of ActBlue.\n\nYet other Republicans say the problem goes deeper. Zac Moffatt, who was digital director on Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, said Democrats had succeeded in devising a playbook that guaranteed a constant stream of online donations. The party, he said, had invested heavily to develop data files on supporters, with whom they kept in touch throughout the campaign.\n\nRepublicans, he said, often spent less on list-building and waited until later in the election season to engage.\n\n\u201cFocusing on ActBlue as the issue,\" Moffatt said, \"is missing the forest for the trees.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans, however, see reason for optimism. In July, the Republican Jewish Coalition, an organization partly funded by Adelson, launched an ActBlue-like portal inviting supporters to give small donations to a list of endorsed candidates. The effort generated about $400,000 in contributions, an indication to its proponents that conservative small donors could be drawn to such a platform.\n\nOthers are just relieved that online giving has finally become a priority for the party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad everyone has woken up to this,\u201d said Gerrit Lansing, Revv\u2019s co-founder and a former Republican National Committee top digital strategist. \u201cThis is a five-alarm fire.\u201d\n\nRachel Bade contributed to this report.", "Sen.

Cory Booker is personally calling political pros in Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire to staff a 2020 campaign. Gov.

Elizabeth Warren was interviewing campaign advisers even before Tuesday\u2019s midterms.\n\nWith a sprawling field of expected candidates and a limited pool of high-caliber operatives, a sprint is on among 2020 Democratic hopefuls for campaign managers, strategists, finance directors and field directors who can run a presidential campaign.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cOne of the realities is that there are not enough campaign staff to do the job that is required,\u201d said Norm Sterzenbach, the former chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party. He joked that candidates would be wise to lock down staff before talking with their loved ones about whether to give up their lives to a presidential campaign \u2014 not the other way around.\n\nThat explains why, with the midterm elections not even a week in the history books, Democratic hopefuls have been scrambling to fill out their 2020 teams. Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 aides, for instance, were reaching out to operatives coming off of successful midterm campaigns.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re having phone calls on the staff level to gauge interest,\u201d said a source within the Sanders camp.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Cannon worked for Senate Majority PAC during the 2018 cycle and for Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016.\n\nBooker himself called staff prospects in three early states, including field organizers and senior officials involved in some of the state's marquee midterm campaigns, four people with knowledge of the calls told POLITICO. While Booker isn\u2019t making offers yet, \u201che\u2019s building a bridge\u201d to potential aides, said one person with knowledge of the conversations.\n\nWarren, who also dispensed staff to early states to help in the midterms, had spoken before Tuesday to potential top campaign strategists about coming on board, according to two sources with knowledge of the discussions.\n\nAll the activity does not necessarily translate to top talent signing contracts. It does, however, reflect efforts by likely candidates to build relationships for when the time comes.\n\nThere\u2019s every reason to believe the competition will be steep, given early activity on the Democratic side already.\n\nRep. John Delaney (D-Md.) announced his presidential bid and has staff on the ground in Iowa. Progressive billionaire Tom Steyer launched his NextGen youth voter engagement initiative in Iowa and this last cycle, also had two nieces working campaigns in the first presidential state. Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley also has dispatched staff to Iowa in an effort to try gain a leg-up in learning the political landscape there.\n\n\u201cThe logistical challenge is if we have a field of 20 to 30 candidates, you know it\u2019s not going to be easy to find 20 to 30 state directors or 20 to 30 communication directors,\u201d said Jeff Link, a veteran Iowa Democratic strategist. \u201cOr if you figure everybody had 50 field staff, it\u2019s hard to find 1,500 people to have experience of any kind. You\u2019re either going to bring in people from other states or you\u2019re just going to bring people here who have never worked on a campaign before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the challenge,\u201d Link added, and \u201cthat\u2019s why I think there\u2019s going to be a push early to find staff at all levels. Whether it be leadership, middle managers or even field organizers.\u201d\n\nOne top prospect for campaign manager is off the market, at least for now: Anne Caprara, who ran the massive, record-spending campaign of Illinois Governor-elect J.B. Pritzker, was just named Pritzker\u2019s chief of staff. Caprara, who oversaw some 200 campaign workers that made up a massive field operation, said candidates have to keep in mind this is a unique cycle for Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe thing I worry about the most given how big I think the field is going to be in 2020, there are not enough senior-level people who have experience in this stuff in the party to go around for everybody,\u201d Caprara said.\n\nAnd that pool is winnowed even more when you exclude those who weren\u2019t part of the last midterm cycle, she said.\n\n\u201cIf you have not been out in the field doing this work for either this cycle or last, it\u2019s going to be very hard to go around and campaign right now,\u201d Caprara said. \u201cThe world of campaigns has changed. Since Barack Obama ran in 2012, since Hillary Clinton ran in 2016. If your experience on campaigns is from before the last two cycles, you\u2019re going to struggle managing a presidential or staffing a presidential.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s changed? Campaign personnel at all levels want to have more of a say in day-to-day operations. They\u2019re active, even chatty, on social media. That could help candidates connect with voters over new mediums, but brings with it the risk of losing control over the campaign's messaging.\n\n\u201cThe expectations that both voters and staff have of campaigns now are much different than they were two or four years ago,\u201d Caprara said. \u201cI feel like you have to have been through the wars at this point, to understand what the struggle is going to be for 2020.\u201d\n\nBut one veteran hand offered potential 2020 candidates a word of warning before seriously shopping for staff: Get your own ducks in a row.\n\nFormer Democratic National Committee chairman and former President Bill Clinton strategist David Wilhelm said when he first sat down in a room with Clinton to talk, he was sold.\n\nAnd the two never even talked about politics.\n\n\u201cHe talked about where he wanted to take the country. He talked about where he wanted to take the party, policy issues that were important to him \u2014 and we just connected,\u201d Wilhelm told POLITICO. \u201cThat had great appeal to me as a candidate for campaign manager, because I thought, \u2018This guy has a real clue about why he\u2019s running. This guy has a vision for where he wants to take the country.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat thinking is really hard to do,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen a caucus is a week away.\u201d\n\nAlex Thompson contributed to this report.\n\n", "Critics of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi believe that a challenger will eventually emerge. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images Congress 'You can\u2019t beat somebody with nobody': Pelosi foes struggle to find a leader For now, the anti-Pelosi caucus is determined to show she lacks the votes to become speaker \u2014 settling on an alternative will sort itself out later.\n\nThe House Democratic rebels trying to keep Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker have a big problem: They can't seem to find someone to run against her.\n\nThe naysayers claim they have the 15 to 20 votes it would take to block Pelosi on the House floor.

On one hand, there's a cast of incoming Democratic freshmen who ran on change, in some cases starting with Pelosi; on the other, there is no potential replacement with anything approaching the seasoning or legislative savvy the 78-year-old Californian possesses, making it hard to see how she won't be speaker again.\n\nLeaders of the anti-Pelosi faction acknowledged that some lawmakers are nervous about taking on Pelosi, who\u2019s presided over the caucus for 16 years. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve focused on growing their numbers. The first order of business, they say, is to demonstrate that Pelosi doesn\u2019t have the 218 votes needed to be speaker; after that, they figure a challenger will emerge.\n\nEven if no one steps up immediately, some rebels believe they can still push out Pelosi.\n\n\u201cThe idea that you can\u2019t beat somebody with nobody isn\u2019t true when you have a minimum threshold to meet,\u201d said Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) one of the organizers of the movement against Pelosi. \u201cWe have a lot of great, diverse candidates from all across the caucus who would be fantastic as our next speaker. They just need the opportunity to rise up and step forward.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/795/1155968404_5859496769001_5859491003001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nNot all her critics are so confident. Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), who\u2019s vowed to vote against Pelosi on the House floor, acknowledged that the lack of an alternative candidate \u201cmakes it more difficult \u2026 for a lot of members\u201d because \u201cthey need to have somebody to vote for.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut at this point in time, we don\u2019t have anyone to run to remove the rock in the road,\u201d he said.\n\nPelosi has offered a variety of reasons why she should be reelected as speaker. She argues that she has the toughness to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump in the White House. In a nod to the calls for her to move on, Pelosi also suggested before the election that she would be a \"transitional\" leader, though she is not repeating that possibility in recent conversations with members.\n\nAt the same time, a group of incoming freshman told voters that they would not back her, and she is seen as toxic in their Republican-leaning districts. Voting for Pelosi could put these seats at risk in 2020.\n\nThere\u2019s clearly angst about Pelosi\u2019s return to the speakership among a large bloc of House Democrats, though that doesn't mean they will vote against her, especially if there's no better candidate to replace her. Many have privately prayed for Pelosi\u2019s exit for years and bemoaned the trio of septuagenarians who\u2018ve created a leadership bottleneck at the top: Pelosi, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Assistant Leader James Clyburn (D-S.C.).\n\nJim Clyburn (left) and Steny Hoyer have made it clear they will stand by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n\nThe push for new leadership suffered a setback this spring when Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.), widely viewed as potential Pelosi successor, lost a June primary to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. That left Pelosi's most aggressive critics without an obvious option.\n\nSeveral House Democrats have expressed interest, but so far, none has been willing to challenge her for speaker. Other established figures \u2014 including Hoyer and Clyburn \u2014 have made clear they'll support Pelosi as long as she's there.\n\nThere are sound reasons why any Democrat would be wary of taking on Pelosi, especially at this stage. A challenger would get \"beat up badly,\u201d Schrader said. Better to keep the focus on Pelosi, he insisted.\n\n\"Anybody but her,\" Schrader said.\n\nFollowing the disappointing election results in 2016, Ryan won 63 votes in a closed-door caucus vote, while Pelosi received 134, her poorest showing since running against Hoyer for deputy minority whip in 2001. Yet all but four Democrats ultimately supported Pelosi on the House floor in the public roll call, including Ryan himself.\n\nThis time, Pelosi faces a steeper task. For minority leader, she needed just a majority of the Democratic Caucus to vote for her as leader. Now, a small number of Democrats \u2014 the precise figure depends on a handful that have yet to be called, but it's likely 17 to 20 \u2014 combined with presumably unanimous opposition from Republicans, could sink her bid for speaker.\n\nSo far, 10 current or incoming Democratic House members have said they will vote against her on the House floor.\n\nDemocrats will choose their leaders starting on Nov. 28. The floor vote for speaker takes place on the first day of the new Congress.\n\nRyan has not ruled out running against Pelosi but clearly does not want to. The anti-Pelosi group has sounded out numerous other Democrats about challenging Pelosi but would not say who they are.\n\nIf Pelosi\u2019s critics can\u2019t find someone to take her on, they do have one extreme tactic at their disposal: take the fight to the House floor and attempt to deny her the votes to be speaker even without a successor in place. That\u2019s exactly what the House Freedom Caucus hoped to do following the 2016 election, when they chose conservative Rep. Jim Jordan to become what they called the \u201csacrificial lamb\u201d against Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nAt the time, Freedom Caucus leaders were under no pretense that Jordan would win, but that wasn\u2019t the point. The hard-line conservatives merely wanted to deny Ryan \u2014 who had repeatedly criticized Trump during the campaign \u2014 the votes he needed to be speaker, in the hopes that another pro-Trump candidate would emerge. The group ultimately backed down when Trump supported Ryan for the job.\n\nRep. Filemon Vela (D-Texas), a Pelosi critic who believes they can take her out without a challenger, predicted a repeat of the Freedom Caucus move. \u201cMy position from the very beginning has been that we\u2019ve got to do this on the House floor,\" Vela said.\n\nSuch a ploy would throw the caucus into chaos just as Democrats are taking control. The leadership vacuum would almost certainly divert attention from the party\u2019s platform and its oversight of Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear whether the anti-Pelosi movement will have the numbers to derail her. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a big part of the caucus that actively does not want Nancy Pelosi reelected\u201d as the top Democrat, Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) said.\n\nConnolly added, however, that there is widespread sentiment within the caucus that more leadership opportunities need to be created for younger members over the next two years.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned about how we broaden opportunity for the caucus, and what commitments we\u2019re going to get from people who will be in leadership to do that,\" he said.", "Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes. | AP Photo 'Incompetence': Broward election chief likely to be forced from office by Scott, DeSantis\n\nMIAMI \u2014 Counting unlawful votes.

Misprinted ballots that have gone out.\u201d\n\nSnipes' attorney, Burnadette Norris-Weeks, said Snipes is being unfairly attacked, along with Palm Beach County's supervisor, Susan Bucher.\n\n\"Political gamesmanship at its best,\" Norris-Weeks said via email. \"The Broward County and Palm Beach County Supervisors of Elections (and the canvassing boards for both counties) have done nothing more than count all votes as required by law. Ridiculous!\"\n\nIf Snipes is suspended by the governor, incoming Florida state Senate President Bill Galvano said it\u2019s time to have his chamber investigate and prepare to strike the final blow by removing her from office \u2014 just as the chamber did to her predecessor, Miriam Oliphant, for mismanaging the 2002 Democratic gubernatorial primary.\n\n\u201cWhat she\u2019s demonstrated over the years is a series of mistakes that rise above the level of negligence and into incompetence,\u201d Galvano said. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to keep ignoring this and every option should be on the table.\u201d\n\nUnder Florida's constitution, \"incompetence\" is a specific cause that a governor can invoke in suspending a constitutional officer such as Snipes.\n\nDemocrats say Snipes has privately confided that she plans to quit, but it\u2019s unclear when. \u201cI hope it\u2019s soon,\u201d said one state Senate Democrat who declined to be named. \u201cOtherwise, she\u2019s a goner.\u201d Heading into the election, Democratic campaigns fretted about what her mismanagement would do in the second-largest Democratic county in the state.\n\nNeither Scott's nor DeSantis\u2019 teams will comment on the record about their plans for what many see as Snipes\u2019 looming suspension, because both men are involved in races that are the subject of recounts and lawsuits. They don\u2019t want their comments used against them in court, according to those close to both Republicans.\n\n\u201cI need to be careful with what I say about her,\u201d Scott confided to a source who confidentially relayed the conversation to POLITICO, adding that the governor \u201cis solely focused on winning. He\u2019s senator-elect and he has blinders on to make sure it stays that way.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s ire with Snipes is clear. He already linked the controversies of slow counting and what Republicans call \u201cfound\u201d ballots in Broward to a liberal effort to \u201csteal\u201d this election; he asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to Investigate.\n\nThough FDLE has found no evidence of a crime, Scott\u2019s Senate campaign on Sunday filed an extraordinary civil court motion that asked the state police agency or Broward County\u2019s sheriff to \u201cimpound and secure all voting machines, tallying devices, and ballots\" as if the elections office were a crime scene. He filed a similar lawsuit against Bucher, who has had fewer problems than Snipes over the years, but who said Saturday that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to finish the recount on time.\n\nThe lawsuit against Snipes reads like an indictment, detailing numerous instances of Snipes ignoring the law and busting statutory deadlines.\n\n\u201cIn 2016, the Supervisor of Election\u2019s office: (i) mailed an unknown number of absentee ballots that omitted a proposed state constitutional amendment; (ii) posted early voting numbers online thirty minutes before the polls closed in primary elections; and (iii) opened ballots in private which prevented citizens and other groups of ensuring ballots were properly cast and counted,\u201d the suit says.\n\n\u201cLikewise,\u201d the suit continues, \u201cin 2017, the Supervisor of Elections: (i) admitted that her office has allowed ineligible voters \u2014 including felons and non-citizens \u2014 to cast votes; and (ii) wrongfully authorized the destruction of ballots cast in the 2016 Democratic primary election for the 23rd Congressional District of Florida.\u201d\n\nHowever, the parade of horribles leads to one question that Scott\u2019s spokesmen won\u2019t or can\u2019t answer: Why didn\u2019t he suspend Snipes before if, as his suit says, she \u201chas a long and troubling history of violating Florida election law, especially in close elections?\"\n\nScott\u2019s lawsuit also references another lawsuit his campaign successfully brought against Snipes last week after she failed to provide public information concerning the votes she had left to tally after Election Day \u2014 information that should readily be at her fingertips and that, under Florida\u2019s Sunshine Laws, she should have disclosed.\n\nSnipes was unwilling or unable to provide the data, and her office didn\u2019t follow state law requiring regular vote tally updates every 45 minutes, Scott\u2019s new lawsuit alleges. Then, in the dead of night, the office suddenly uploaded tens of thousands of new ballots in the Democratic-heavy county, causing Scott\u2019s margins statewide to fall so far that it triggered a recount, with his margin in the race against Sen. Bill Nelson falling below a half percent. The margin in the race is now 0.15 percent, below the quarter-point threshold for a manual recount.\n\nTo cap it all off, the recount was supposed to start at 7 a.m. Sunday. But a number of technical glitches delayed the official start of the recount of the more than 700,000 ballots until just before noon. At the last minute, Snipes also admitted to mistakenly including 22 absentee ballots that, under state law, are considered \u201cillegal\u201d because the voter signature of the envelope they were contained in did not meet the voter signature on file.\n\nBroward County also failed to finish tallying all of its available votes by noon Saturday, the deadline for the first wave of unofficial results to be submitted to the state. It also failed to upload all the in-person early votes and available absentee ballot votes by 7 p.m. on the day before the election.\n\nIn a response to Scott\u2019s lawsuit, the Broward County canvassing board blamed the delay on Scott\u2019s attorneys because they objected so much to the canvassing process before the deadline. The reply also says that, if Scott wants to contest the election, he can do so at a later date and that Scott \u201chas invented a false deadline for completing canvass of ballots where none in fact exists. The first unofficial results are just that \u2014 i.e., unofficial.\u201d\n\nThe ultimate irony is that the Broward County ballot design approved by Snipes might have cost Nelson \u2014 not Scott \u2014 tens of thousands of votes. The race was tucked in the lower left-hand corner of the ballot, just under the instructions, and many voters appear to have missed it. Indeed, for the first time ever, the top-of-the-ticket Senate race received fewer votes than all of the other down-ballot statewide matches, including the contest for agriculture commissioner, which is also headed to a recount.\n\nIf the Senate race in Broward had received as many total votes as the gubernatorial race and if the margins for Scott and Nelson remained constant, then Scott\u2019s margin statewide would have shrunk from 12,562 to 2,608 statewide \u2014 a far-easier margin for the Democrat to flip. Nelson\u2019s margin for the undervoted Senate race might have even been larger, consultants estimate, because those who missed the Senate race on the ballot were more likely infrequent Democratic-leaning voters who were driven to the polls by a large liberal get-out-the-vote effort.\n\n\u201cScott shouldn\u2019t kick her out of office. He should send her flowers,\u201d an insider connected to DeSantis said sarcastically. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s better for us if Snipes just stays in office and continues to screw everything up for Democrats. But really, this is a problem for everyone and Scott should have removed her before this happened. This is his problem. He should have fixed it. Ron will if he has to.\u201d\n\nMany Democrats refrained from speaking critically of Snipes. But some clearly have had enough.\n\n\u201cIf what is being reported is true, the Senate is going to have to take some drastic action,\u201d said state Sen. Kevin Rader, a Democrat whose district includes part of Broward County. Rader acknowledged that Snipes is a problem for Democrats statewide because Broward is the second-largest county and is a liberal bastion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about Democratic votes here; this is a huge Democratic count,\u201d he said. \u201cSo from a partisan standpoint, it\u2019s like, \u2018Are you kidding me?\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother Broward Democrat, state Rep. Jared Moskowitz, said he doesn\u2019t expect Snipes to last.\n\n\u201cI suspect she won\u2019t be here for long,\u201d said Moskowitz, \u201cwhether she is suspended from office, she leaves office early or she\u2019s voted out.\u201d", "Richard Ojeda, seen at a West Virginia gym in May 2018, made an unsuccessful bid for Congress in the state\u2019s 3rd District. | John Raby/AP Photo Elections Richard Ojeda to run for president\n\nRichard Ojeda just lost his bid for West Virginia\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, but by Sunday evening, he filed papers to run for president.\n\nThe filing with the Federal Election Commission came on the same day Ojeda told supporters to be prepared for a Monday announcement.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI hope you will join me tomorrow at noon EST for an important announcement,\u201d he said in a Sunday email to supporters. \u201cBecause like I said, we are not done fighting.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Republican Carol Miller defeated Ojeda 56 percent to 44 percent in the southern West Virginia District.\n\nOjeda, a fiery Democrat who initially voted for Donald Trump, then admitted he regretted it, predicted in his concession speech Tuesday: \u201cMake no mistake about it!

Sessions\u2019 decision held even greater importance because he had recused himself from overseeing the the special counsel\u2019s inquiry. Whitaker\u2019s ascent to the top of the Justice Department means that he, rather than Rosenstein, will now be in charge of Mueller.\n\nA hearing could very well mean that Whitaker would be under lights and in front of Democrats eager to embarrass the White House \u2014 the same situation that tripped up Sessions when he was pressed in January 2017 about his contacts with Russians during the presidential campaign. He was later forced to correct his remarks, and the scrutiny surrounding the episode was among the events that preceded his recusal, a move Trump never forgave him for making.\n\nNadler and other top Democrats point to Whitaker\u2019s litany of statements questioning or even suggesting to curtail the investigation, comments that he made before joining the Justice Department. Whitaker proposed slashing Mueller\u2019s budget as a way to bring the investigation to a close, he parroted the president\u2019s line in 2017 by saying there was \u201cno collusion \u201d between Russia and the Trump campaign, and at the onset of the investigation he questioned whether there was even enough information to conduct a probe.\n\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway said all of the statements should be considered irrelevant because Whitaker was a \u201cprivate citizen\u201d when he made them. Before joining the administration, Whitaker served as a U.S. attorney in Iowa during the George W. Bush administration and was a frequent Republican candidate for office in the state. He also led the conservative advocacy group Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust. Among Iowans, he\u2019s known for playing tight end on the 1991 Iowa Hawkeyes football team, which went to the Rose Bowl.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about Matt Whitaker\u2019s statements as a private citizen a year and a half ago when the Mueller investigation first started, what he has said on cable TV, I don\u2019t think that disqualifies somebody from being the chief law enforcement officer at the Department of Justice, which is an executive function,\u201d Conway told host Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nEven if those statements are outdated, Conway said it would be \u201ca mistake to try to shut down the Mueller investigation\u201d in the way Whitaker\u2019s past comments suggested.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who said he\u2019d spoken with Whitaker and would soon meet with him in person, said he was convinced the investigation would not be impeded.\n\n\u201cI am confident the Mueller investigation will be allowed to come to a good solid conclusion, that there\u2019ll be no political influence put on Mr. Mueller by Mr. Whitaker to do anything other than Mr. Mueller\u2019s job,\u201d Graham, an ally of the White House, told Margaret Brennan on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nConway, stressing that it isn\u2019t clear whether Whitaker was even previously read into Mueller\u2019s investigation, since his boss recused himself, added that Whitaker and Trump had never discussed the investigation. Trump went even further on Friday when he told reporters, \u201cI don't know Matt Whitaker,\u201d an assertion that set off a race between video editors to compose a jump-cut of a month earlier when the president told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d: \u201cI can tell you Matt Whitaker\u2019s a great guy. I mean, I know Matt Whitaker.\u201d The two have also reportedly met in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cThe president does know Matt Whitaker, has gotten to know him over the course of the last year since he has been the chief of staff to the attorney general,\u201d Conway said Sunday in an apparent correction. \u201cThe president\u2019s point is it\u2019s not like he\u2019s putting a friend in there who he\u2019s known for his entire life, he\u2019s putting somebody who has been working at the Department of Justice for 13 months now.\u201d\n\nDemocrats and some legal scholars, including George Conway, Kellyanne Conway\u2019s husband, have questioned the constitutionality of Whitaker\u2019s appointment because he was not confirmed by the Senate. Whitaker, who takes over the oversight role from Rosenstein, is now overseeing an investigation that has spent millions of dollars investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and ensnared Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager, campaign manager and a foreign policy adviser.\n\nOne possible avenue for ensuring that Mueller completes his investigation would be protecting him specifically through legislation, as a bipartisan bill put forth by Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) would do. But as in the past, other Senate Republicans questioned why such a move would be necessary or, as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has argued, whether it would even be constitutional.\n\n\u201cWhy protect something that\u2019s actually continuing?\u201d Sen.

In August, Trump criticized California wildfire management and threatened to cut off federal aid, inaccurately suggesting that the state was allowing millions of gallons of water to flow to the sea rather than using the water for fighting fires.\n\nThe president, who polls show is historically unpopular in the state, has called Brown \u201cMoonbeam,\u2019\u2019 slamming the governor\u2019s position to limit the role of National Guard troops along the border with Mexico. His latest tweets also came during the same week Republicans suffered big losses in the midterm elections, which could end up with the state\u2019s GOP caucus in the House withering to eight out of 53 members when the full vote count is finished. During the election cycle, the president also jabbed at Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, calling him a \u201cclown\u201d as he endorsed Newsom\u2019s unsuccessful Republican rival, John Cox, for governor.\n\nTrump did later appear to soften his message, acknowledging the loss of lives and the round-the-clock work of first responders, saying, \u201cGod bless them.\u201d But that did not appear to mollify state officials, who pushed back angrily against his attempts to blame mismanagement for the firestorms.\n\nBrown, in a statement issued Sunday, said: \u201cWe have the best firefighters and first responders in the country working in some of the most difficult conditions imaginable.

Disaster victims deserve help & sympathy. Oh, and guess who owns much of the forest land in CA? Your federal agencies. CA only owns 2%. Guess who cut funding to forest management in the budget? YOU DID.\u201d\n\nAnd Rep. Adam Schiff, another California Democrat, slammed Trump\u2019s response on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday, saying: \u201cPeople are losing their lives, losing loved ones, losing their homes. \u2026 [F]or the president, at a time when people are facing utter disaster, to be making a statement like this, making a threat like this, this just goes to show how little he understands the job he has.\u201d\n\nSen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) echoed the California Democrats\u2019 concerns, telling \u201cMeet the Press\u201d host Chuck Todd: \u201cI don't think it\u2019s appropriate to threaten funding. That\u2019s not going to happen. Funding will be available. It always is available to our people wherever they are, whatever disaster they are facing. I do think, though, this year we came up with a strong bipartisan success in fixing the wildfire funding issue that had kind of paralyzed our ability to go out and fight fires and suppress fires and mitigate next year\u2019s forest fires.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo one of the great bipartisan accomplishments of this past Congress was actually in the area of forest fires and finding a solution for funding,\u201d Gardner added.\n\nThree fires are blazing through the state. In Northern California\u2019s Butte County, the Camp fire has destroyed more than 6,700 structures and left 23 people dead, making it the state\u2019s most destructive fire . More than 250,000 have been evacuated \u2014 and two have died \u2014 in the wake of the Woolsey fire , which has raced through Malibu, Westlake Village and Thousand Oaks in Southern California, destroying homes and continuing to threatening parts of Simi Valley and West Hills. The Hill fire burned more than 4,000 acres in canyons near Camarillo Springs and Cal State Channel Islands, west of Thousand Oaks.\n\nA state of emergency has been declared in Los Angeles, Ventura and Butte counties because of multiple fires, and late last week California secured direct federal assistance to further support the affected communities, Brown\u2019s office said.\n\nTrump did not visit California after deadly fires in Santa Rosa and Redding over the summer caused billions of dollars in damage \u2014 a decision that many Democrats in the state saw as an intentional slight that contrasted dramatically with the president\u2019s visits to red states like Florida and Texas, which have suffered hurricane damage.\n\nKevin Yamamura contributed to this report.", "President Donald Trump at the Suresnes American Cemetery and memorial outside Paris on Sunday. He called the visit the \u201chighlight\u201d of his trip abroad. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo White House Global leaders snub Trump and his nationalistic vision Amid Armistice Day events in France, the president stands at the outskirts of the world stage.\n\nSURESNES, France \u2014 President Donald Trump looked very much alone in Paris this weekend, isolated from European leaders and longtime U.S. allies as he continued to pursue his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.\n\nHe seemed most at ease late Sunday afternoon, on the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, as he visited the Suresnes American Cemetery and memorial just outside Paris, where the stage and star power were his alone.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThere, standing before rows upon rows of simple white crosses with a view of the Eiffel Tower in the distance, he commemorated Americans killed in \u201cThe Great War\u201d and paid tribute to the way the U.S. fought alongside European nations.\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, President Macron presented an oak sapling from Belleau Wood as a gift to our nation \u2014 an enduring reminder of our friendship sealed in battle,\u201d Trump told the audience, referring to the French president\u2019s state visit in April. \u201cWe fought well together. You could not fight better than we fought together.\u201d\n\nHe called Suresnes the \u201chighlight\u201d of his trip during his roughly 10-minute speech, and joked to the six World War II veterans in attendance that he hoped \u201cI look like that someday.\u201d\n\nIt was the rare moment in Paris, an event where Trump was in control and could try to shine, coming off a weekend in which European leaders rebuked him both implicitly and explicitly. From Macron to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the message seemed clear: Trump is taking the U.S. in a more isolated direction, while former allies band together to reject him.\n\nBefore roughly 70 world leaders, Macron, for instance, criticized the nationalist movement that Trump has embraced and made a cornerstone of his two-year-old presidency.\n\n\u201cPatriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism,\u201d Macron said earlier Sunday at a ceremony in Paris. \u201cNationalism is a betrayal of patriotism by saying, \u2018Our interest first, who cares about the others?\u2019\u201d\n\nEven the optics of that Armistice Day event showed Trump on the outskirts. European leaders took buses to the event and proceeded toward the Arc de Triomphe as church bells rang, while the president and first lady Melania Trump entered once the European leaders had already taken their places on risers. The only person who arrived after Trump was President Vladimir Putin of Russia, who made his own grand entrance.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump arrived after the group of Europeans because of \u201csecurity protocols.\u201d\n\nThe White House\u2019s decision to scrap a planned visit to the Aisne-Marne memorial because of rainy and overcast weather on Saturday caused its own backlash online and in Europe. Aisne-Marne is the burial site of 2,289 veterans. The monument at an adjacent site, Belleau Wood, celebrates U.S. Marines who fought there in a pivotal battle in 1918.\n\nWinston Churchill\u2019s grandson Nicholas Soames wrote on Twitter: \u201cThey died with their face to the foe and that pathetic inadequate @realDonaldTrump couldn\u2019t even defy the weather to pay his respects to The Fallen.\u201d\n\nEuropean leaders piled on, too, with Macron posting a photo to social media of him and Merkel clasping hands at Compi\u00e8gne, the site of the signing of the ceasefire agreement that stopped World War I.\n\nIn a late Sunday statement, Sanders said driving out to the Aisne-Marne memorial would have required closing \"substantial portions of the Paris roadways ... on short notice,\" and that Trump didn't want to \"cause that kind of unexpected disruption to the city and its people.\"\n\nThe two-day trip provided moment after moment of this pattern: Trump holding himself apart from European leaders as they, in turn, refused to abide by his actions and rhetoric. For foreign policy experts, it was a long-anticipated moment in which Macron showed the limits of his like-fest with Trump and sought to assert himself as a strong leader on a continent where the alliances are rapidly shifting.\n\nLater Sunday afternoon, Macron again distanced himself from the American president shortly before Air Force One took off for the U.S.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a strong believer in cooperation between the different peoples, and I'm a strong believer of the fact that this cooperation is good for everybody, where the nationalists are sometimes much more based on a unilateral approach,\u201d Macron said during a CNN interview, one coda to the weekend.", "\"Impeachment is a question that will come up down the road maybe, depending on findings of the Mueller [investigation],\u201d said Rep. Jerold Nadler. | Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo Congress Nadler: Whitaker will be \u2018our very first witness\u2019\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler, the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, on Sunday promised that acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker would be the first witness newly empowered Democrats call to testify when they take control in January.\n\n\"Our very first witness on \u2014 after Jan. 3, we will subpoena Mr. \u2014 or we will summon, if necessary, subpoena Mr. Whitaker,\" Nadler (D-N.Y.) told CNN host Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nUntil Tuesday's elections, Democrats lacked the heft of subpoena power when it came to investigating allegations about President Donald Trump and his administration. Trump has said that even if the party can subpoena for documents or for his Cabinet members to testify, they should be aware that two can play at that game \u2014 and that Democrats will have to choose between policy deals and investigations.\n\n\u201cSomebody says, \u2018Oh, you can do \u2019em both.\u2019 No, you can\u2019t,\u201d Trump said during a news conference Wednesday. \u201cBecause if they\u2019re doing that, we\u2019re not doing the other, just so you understand. So we won\u2019t be doing that.\u201d\n\nNadler said Trump picked Whitaker, who previously served as Attorney General Jeff Sessions' chief of staff, to temporarily fill in for his former boss because he's a \"hatchet man.\" As a CNN analyst and in other forums, Whitaker criticized special counsel Robert Mueller's probe and said before joining the Justice Department that Sessions' replacement could slash Mueller's budget as a way to curtail and end the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\"He's totally unqualified,\" Nadler said. \"And his only qualification seems to be that he wants to be \u2014 that the president wants him to be the hatchet man to destroy the Mueller investigation.\"\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee would also be the site where articles of impeachment against Trump would be written, but the New York Democrat reiterated on Sunday that his party is a long way from that process.\n\n\"Impeachment is a question that will come up down the road maybe, depending on findings of the Mueller [investigation],\u201d Nadler said. \u201cWe\u2019re far from that right now.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats said before the midterm elections that if they returned to power they would probe Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Supreme Court confirmation, including whether he committed perjury. Nadler said it's \"not a question of investigating Justice Kavanaugh\" but rather whether the White House put undue pressure on the FBI during its limited-scope investigation of allegations of sexual assault and misconduct leveled against the then-nominee.\n\n\"We do have a responsibility, I believe, to investigate the process by which the FBI was stifled in its investigation by the White House,\" Nadler told host George Stephanopoulos on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"When the FBI was asked to investigate, there was not a complete investigation.\"", "Debbie Sue Carter, 21, pretty and vivacious, had just moved into her first apartment in the tiny town of Ada, Oklahoma, where she was born and raised. It was October 8, 1982, and she was coming into her own as an adult. But Debbie still came home regularly to see her mother, Peggy, her two younger sisters and her Aunt Glenna, who lived one block away with Debbie\u2019s little cousin, Christy, who was 8 years old.\n\nIn early December, Debbie came to Peggy\u2019s house to do her laundry. That night, as she snuggled next to her mother in bed, Peggy recalled, \u201cshe wrapped them long legs around me,\u201d and Peggy teased her, \u201cDebbie Sue, get off of me or I\u2019m gonna tell all of your friends you sleep with your mama.\u201d Debbie said, \u201cI don\u2019t care who you tell,\u201d and she slept in her mother\u2019s bed that night.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA few days later, on December 8, Debbie was found naked on her bedroom floor, gagged with a bloody towel, with the word DIE painted on her stomach. She had been raped and strangled to death.\n\nThe darkness that engulfed the family after Debbie\u2019s murder marked the end of her cousin Christy\u2019s childhood. There were no more boisterous family Christmases, no more casual get-togethers, no more walking to school. Debbie\u2019s grandmother\u2014Peggy and Glenna\u2019s mother\u2014got a pit bull; Peggy spent time in a mental institution. The world was dangerous in a way that was undeniable and unspeakable at the same time. Christy never felt safe again.\n\nThis is not a true crime whodunit. This is the story of what happens to the family of a murder victim when they find out years later that everything the criminal justice system had led them to believe was a lie. This is a story of wrongful conviction told from the perspective of Debbie\u2019s family, how they survived one earthquake and then another, and came to the other side. It is also about Debbie\u2019s little cousin Christy: her reckoning, her rage, her forgiveness, and her transformation into a crusader for a different vision of justice\u2014a vision that put her at odds with her tight-knit, rock-ribbed red-state community.\n\n\n\n***\n\nDebbie\u2019s murder remained unsolved for five years, until a woman arrested on fraud charges implicated Ron Williamson, a man who happened to be in jail at the same time as she was. Williamson\u2019s supposed involvement in Debbie\u2019s rape and murder only added to the sensationalism surrounding the case: He had been a baseball star with real prospects for the major leagues before drug use and mental illness had derailed his life. Also charged was Williamson\u2019s friend, Dennis Fritz, implicated by another jailhouse informant. With the charges of both men came an onslaught of media attention, which was yet another source of stress for Debbie\u2019s family, all of whom felt increasingly sidelined and powerless as the case moved from investigation to prosecution. Christy explained, \u201cfrom the victim\u2019s standpoint, it\u2019s no longer your case. It\u2019s the state\u2019s case. For a rape victim, her body isn\u2019t even her body anymore, it\u2019s a piece of evidence. Even the name of the case belongs to the perpetrator. Debbie was literally erased.\u201d\n\nBut Debbie\u2019s family took some solace in knowing that they were getting justice when the jury returned guilty verdicts in 1988. Williamson was given the death penalty, Fritz life in prison without the possibility of parole. What Christy felt for them, she said, was \u201ctrue hatred.\u201d She went to bed at night praying that they would suffer as much as possible.\n\nChristy remained in Ada as an adult. She married her high school boyfriend, Dustin, and became a licensed professional counselor who specialized in helping broken families. She stuck close to her own family, particularly her Aunt Peggy. At 25, 11 years after the verdicts, she was pregnant with her first child. Blonde and cheerleader pretty, she exuded warmth and a can-do attitude. Though she stood only 4 feet, 10 inches tall, she was tough and implacably determined to steamroll over any obstacle in her path. But at the time, Christy saw no obstacles: Life was good.\n\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThen Christy\u2019s world exploded: Her mother, Glenna, called to tell her that the newspapers were planning to print a story that Williamson and Fritz were about to be exonerated for Debbie\u2019s murder. Days later, Christy learned the details for the first time sitting in the courtroom as the judge explained that there had been a terrible mistake. DNA evidence recovered from Debbie\u2019s body matched that of one of the state\u2019s key witnesses in the murder case, a man named Glen Gore. Fritz and Williamson\u2014who at one point had been five days away from being executed\u2014were innocent.\n\nOn April 15, 1999, Peggy and her surviving daughters sat beside Christy and Glenna, staring in disbelief as Williamson and Fritz walked out of the courthouse as free men, flanked by Barry Scheck and the other Innocence Project lawyers who had freed them, trailed by a horde of flashing cameras and breathless reporters. Head District Attorney Bill Peterson added to the family\u2019s confusion, continuing to insist that Williamson and Fritz were somehow involved and promising, \u201cwe\u2019ll figure this out.\u201d\n\nWilliamson won a large settlement after his release in 1999. But he remained plagued by inner demons, suffered from alcoholism, and died of cirrhosis of the liver in 2004, two years before John Grisham published An Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town, the bestselling book about his case that has been adapted for a soon-to-be-released Netflix series.\n\nChristy Sheppard with her aunt, Peggy Carter, circa 1976. | Photo courtesy of the author\n\nMeanwhile, in 2003, Glen Gore was convicted of Debbie\u2019s rape and murder and given a death sentence. But the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals threw out the verdict, finding that Gore had been denied a fair trial. Gore was convicted again in 2006, and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.\n\nChristy, who sat beside her Aunt Peggy for both trials, felt none of the vitriol toward Gore that she previously directed at Williamson and Fritz. \u201cIf there is one thing I\u2019ve learned,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s that I would never be stupid enough to say that I was 100 percent sure about anything.\u201d Christy was \u201cfairly confident\u201d that Gore was guilty, \u201cbut to me, it\u2019s just more sadness.\u201d She regularly runs into Gore\u2019s mother, whose grandchildren attend the same school as Christy\u2019s. Looking at the now-elderly woman, Christy sees a fellow victim: \u201cI just feel sad for her.\u201d\n\nOnce Upon A Time. Happily Ever After. The fairy tale myth is deeply embedded in American culture. We cheer for the underdog, turn out in droves to watch our superheroes do battle at the multiplex, root for the star-crossed lovers, and privately cherish the idea that our own lives will follow a similar, if less dramatic trajectory. This aspiration is rooted firmly in our collective belief in the power of second chances and the cauterizing effect of retribution.\n\nThe arc of an exoneration story seems to fit neatly within the fairy tale framework. We see the bang of the gavel, the embrace between client and attorney, the press conference where the exoneree gives thanks\u2014to his tireless advocates, to his family, to God. There are joyful tears. The horror is over.\n\nBut an exoneration is not the happy ending it appears to be. An exoneration is an earthquake. Loud and terrifyingly disruptive, it leaves upheaval and ruin in its wake. After the euphoria comes the rude realization that getting out of prison was a small step in a much longer journey with no clear path forward. Many exonerees suffer horribly\u2014both physically and mentally\u2014in prison. Full of anger, sadness and fear, they learn to stifle their emotions in order to survive. Decades later, they leave prison with no ready access to services or a support system that can help them re-acclimate to society. The road to obtaining money from the state, if that is even possible, can be long and arduous. The physical shackles of prison are gone, but there are invisible ones that remain firmly in place.\n\nBut the damage is not limited to the exonerees. Often forgotten are the crime victim\u2019s family members, like Christy and Peggy, forced to relive the worst experience of their lives with the knowledge that the actual perpetrator was never caught, or caught far too late, after victimizing more people. Sidelined by a system that failed them, they are left to watch as stricken bystanders as the men they had learned to hate are set free. These families feel cast aside, because the exoneration process is not concerned with their suffering. Like the exonerees, they are without the resources to cope with overwhelming and wildly conflicting emotions.\n\nThe anguish of Debbie Sue Carter\u2019s family is shared by thousands of victims who are struggling to recover from the spectacular trauma of a wrongful conviction. While the crimes that shattered their lives happened thousands of miles apart and in different decades, the repercussions have a familiar rhythm. There is the life-upending violation\u2014the violent taking of a loved one\u2019s life. There is the result\u2014conviction, removal from civilized society of the perpetrator, and the leaden certainty of an ending. When the truth erupts with all of its outsize consequences, exposing a system that is rife with venality, bias, and cruelty, the revelations are not freeing. A wrongful conviction is a psychological prison for everyone it impacts directly. The question is how to get out. Some crime victims, like Christy, do it by making a justice of their own.\n\n\n\n***\n\nIn 2013, Katie Monroe, then director of national partnerships at the Innocence Project, reached out to Christy to ask if she would speak on a panel with Jennifer Thompson at the organization\u2019s annual conference in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nThompson, who had been raped and nearly killed in 1985, misidentified her attacker as Ronald Cotton following the faulty identification procedures that were standard practice at the time. Cotton was convicted and sent to prison. When DNA revealed that the real rapist was a man named Bobby Poole, Thompson was overcome with shame and remorse. But after Cotton\u2019s release, he and Thompson had an emotional reunion and formed a lifelong bond. Picking Cotton, the book they co-authored about their improbable story, had been published in 2009 and became a bestseller.\n\nChristy agreed to speak at the conference. Having met Monroe in the past, she trusted her, and it was an honor to be speaking on a stage with Thompson. Still, she did not know what to expect.\n\nThe room was packed with exonerees. \u201cIt was standing room only,\u201d Christy said. Thompson was not particularly nervous. She had participated in hundreds of forums like this one. She expected the usual questions about the specifics of her story: what she believed was her rock-solid memory of the event and her shame and horror at learning years later of her misidentification.\n\nInstead, Monroe posed a different question. \u201cWhat harm was done to you as a victim in the way that the exoneration process unfolded?\u201d\n\nDebbie Sue Carter\u2019s grave. | Photo courtesy of the author\n\nListening to Thompson speak in a choked voice about how she often felt blamed, shamed, used and left out, even by the Innocence Project, Christy said, \u201cI was doing the ugly cry.\u201d The fact that Thompson \u201cwas speaking to the re-victimization and not being included. I felt that, too.\u201d\n\nAs in Thompson\u2019s case, the crime that upended Christy\u2019s life left a wound that would not heal. And there was no moving on from it. Year after year, there were new developments: the investigation, the trials, the death penalty sentence for Williamson, the shocking news that the wrong men had been convicted, the arrest, prosecution, overturned conviction, and re-prosecution of Glen Gore. Her family and its trauma was dissected over and over again in the public square: The town was small, the case was notorious and the glare of the media was unrelenting. No one, it seemed, could ever stop talking about the case, and yet no one had any interest in hearing about the suffering of the victims who were still alive.\n\nNow Monroe was giving Christy a public platform to speak from her heart\u2014not about the facts of the case, or the awfulness of the injustice experienced by the men who had been wrongfully convicted\u2014but about what it had done to her family.\n\nChristy left the conference feeling as though she had come to a turning point. What she realized, she said, was that the experiences of exonerees and crime victims was \u201ccompletely different but also the same.\u201d She explained, \u201cWe have all been lied to, mistreated, and not counted.\u201d Was there a way to communicate that shared trauma and make it mean something larger?\n\n\n\n***\n\nIn 2015, two years later, the opportunity presented itself. Steve Saloom, the former policy director at the Innocence Project, reached out to Christy and asked if she would be willing to write an op-ed about a controversial Oklahoma execution scheduled to take place just days later.\n\nChristy grew up believing in the death penalty as an instrument to deliver justice and retribution. But the condemned man, Richard Glossip, was believed by many prominent people to be innocent. Still, the idea of taking a public stand seemed crazy. \u201cI am going to get my house burned down,\u201d Christy told Saloom. In Oklahoma, embracing the death penalty was a part of being a patriotic American.\n\nIn Ada, people still spoke with pride about a vigilante execution more than a century earlier. It happened in 1909, after a wealthy cattle rancher was killed. Four men were arrested, but before they could be put on trial, a mob broke into the jail, dragged them out, and hung them in a nearby barn. A gruesome photograph of the four dead bodies\u2014dangling from the rafters as chickens pecked at the ground below\u2014was still emblazoned on T-shirts, coffee mugs and postcards. Christy saw the memorabilia around town when she was growing up, always with the same tagline: Ada: A Great Place to Hang Out.\n\nBut Christy no longer felt that way herself. Williamson and Fritz\u2019s exonerations were incontrovertible proof that the state could and did get it wrong. Had Williamson died according to the jury\u2019s determination, strapped to a gurney with state officials pushing lethal drugs into his veins, it would have been murder. Nor was Williamson an outlier; nine other people had been freed from Oklahoma\u2019s death row after it was discovered that they were innocent.\n\nChristy felt that she had been complicit by lending her support to the prosecution\u2019s efforts to kill the men convicted of her cousin\u2019s rape and murder. It was true that state officials declared complete confidence in Glossip\u2019s guilt. But so had the prosecutors in Debbie Carter\u2019s case\u2014even after a judge had ordered the release of Williamson and Fritz, backed up by DNA evidence. The state\u2019s assurances rang hollow. \u201cI know these cases are not about the truth,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt is politics; it is a game where people are moved around and played. It is not fair and it is not balanced.\u201d She decided it would be moral cowardice not to speak out. It was not the cause she would have chosen, but she felt it choosing her.\n\nOn September 12, 2015, four days before Glossip\u2019s execution date, Christy\u2019s op-ed was published in the Oklahoman, the state\u2019s most widely read paper. She started by acknowledging the suffering of the victim and his loved ones. She went on to describe the suffering she and her family members experienced as the evidence unraveled against the condemned men in her cousin\u2019s case. \u201c[The victim] and his family deserve justice,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut justice won\u2019t be served if Glossip is put to death and we find out too late that he is innocent of this crime.\u201d\n\nFrom the left: Christy Sheppard, her mother Glenna, Debbie\u2019s mother, Peggy Carter, and Christy\u2019s daughter Addie. | Photo courtesy of the author\n\nChristy did not say that she was morally opposed to the death penalty; she made it clear she was not: \u201cI still struggle with my desire for justice and what I know about wrongful convictions.\u201d But the question mark hanging over Glossip\u2019s involvement could not be reconciled with the finality of his punishment. As long as there was doubt, she wrote, \u201cit actually threatens justice\u2014and peace of mind\u2014to make the leap to execute him.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, Glossip\u2019s advocates held a standing-room only televised press conference at the Oklahoma State Capital. Don Knight, Glossip\u2019s lead attorney, started off by quoting Christy and imploring his audience to take her message into consideration. An hour later, Knight ended this way: \u201cI began by talking a little bit about that letter that Christy Sheppard gave, and I think I would like to end there as well, because it is a powerful letter. A very powerful letter.\u201d He proceeded to read most of it aloud. Christy, watching at home, was amazed.\n\nOn September 16, hours before Glossip was scheduled to die, his lawyers persuaded the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to issue a stay; but when it was lifted two weeks later, the governor announced that the state was going forward with the execution on September 30. After Glossip had eaten his last meal, he got another reprieve\u2014it was his fourth in a year. The state, as it turned out, did not have any more potassium chloride, one of the drugs required under its protocol.\n\nThe following month, the attorney general announced a moratorium on the death penalty after it was revealed the state had swapped out other drugs in the past\u2014leading in some cases to botched executions. A grand jury was empaneled and spent the next eight months taking testimony and poring over documents to get to the bottom of what one local judge called the \u201cmonkey business\u201d at the corrections department over these improper substitutions. The head of the Department of Corrections and the warden were forced to resign.\n\nMeanwhile, Christy found herself in demand, traveling to Ohio to testify before the state Senate in support of a bill banning the execution of the mentally ill, and to Nebraska to give the keynote address at the annual awards dinner for Nebraskans for Alternatives to the Death Penalty.\n\nIn 2016, Christy was named to the Oklahoma Death Penalty Review Commission, an 11-member bipartisan blue-ribbon panel. When Christy got the call, she said, \u201cI was like, \u2018Me?\u2019\u201d Co-chaired by former Democratic Governor Brad Henry and two former judges, it also included the president of Oklahoma State University, the dean of Oklahoma City University School of Law and the former Republican speaker of the state assembly. Sheppard was the only commission member who was not a lawyer or a politician.\n\nAs the commission began its work, the death penalty remained in the headlines. On May 19, 2016, the Oklahoma grand jury delivered a scathing 106-page indictment of one of the botched executions, calling it an \u201cinexcusable failure\u201d and faulting Oklahoma officials for their recklessness, incompetence, arrogance and neglect.\n\nThe commission met for full-day sessions throughout 2016 and in early 2017, conducting interviews and listening to presentations by experts. Christy decided to do her own presentation. Too often, she felt, politicians and prosecutors invoked the death penalty in the victim\u2019s name. Over and over, Christy had been told that the death penalty was the only true justice for Debbie Carter and her family. Christy wanted to challenge that idea; more fundamentally, she wanted to challenge the idea of what it meant to be the victim of a crime.\n\nOn a large screen in a conference room, Christy presented a short slide show of photographs: Debbie as a pretty and carefree teenager, Christy as a 4-year-old child standing beside with her beloved Aunt Peggy. Mug shots of Williamson and Fritz followed, then pictures taken on the day they were released. Christy ended with a picture of Williamson taken shortly before he died. He was 50 years old, bald, emaciated and toothless. \u201cThis is what death row does to people who aren\u2019t supposed to be there,\u201d she said, and left the image on the screen.\n\nIn March 2017, the commission released its report recommending that the moratorium remain in place. The members were unanimous in concluding that the state\u2019s death penalty was unenforceable under present conditions\u2014or perhaps at all: \u201cMany of the findings of the Commission\u2019s year-long investigation were disturbing and led the Commission to question whether the death penalty can be administered in a way that ensures no innocent person is put to death,\u201d the co-chairs wrote in the executive summary.\n\nThe political climate, too, seemed to have shifted. The report was positively received in the media\u2014including by the conservative editorial board of the Oklahoman.\n\nA flurry of press followed the release of the commission\u2019s report, and Christy gave interviews on television and to local and national media outlets. Initially, she worried about pushback from her family and community about her membership on the commission and her contribution to its ultimate conclusion. But she found little. Mostly what she heard was \u201cYou did great\u201d and \u201cYou looked so pretty in your blue dress.\u201d Several weeks later, Christy went to pick up her youngest son at his school dance and ran into the father of one of his classmates. \u201cI saw you on TV the other day,\u201d he told her, sounding surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were an activist.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well,\u201d Christy paused. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve done a little bit of that.\u201d\n\nLara Bazelon is an associate professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law and a contributing writer to Politico Magazine. This essay was adapted from her book, Rectify: The Power of Restorative Justice After Wrongful Conviction, which was published on October 16.\n\n\n\n", "Matt McCoy is a state senator from Iowa's 21st District.\n\nOn the morning of April 7, 2006, two FBI agents knocked on my door. They informed me that I was being investigated about issues related to bribery and violation of the Hobbs Act. As I tried to recall what the Hobbs Act entailed (robbery and extortion, mostly), they prolonged their visit by pressing \u201cplay\u201d on a tape recorder. I was shocked to hear a conversation I had conducted with my business colleague, Tom Vasquez.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat conversation detailed a dispute we had, regarding my consulting with Vasquez about a business that sold monitoring systems for senior citizens in Iowa. The federal government believed that in my demanding payment for those services, and threatening to strike out on my own as a competitor, I had made what amounted to a threat to use the power of my office against him.\n\nThe FBI claimed this threat was extortion by an elected Iowa state senator. I explained how I had filed the required Senate financial disclosure forms, and that, as citizen legislators who work in the capital for less than one-third of the year, we have to have other employment, hence this dispute. They disagreed, arguing that my comments amounted to an attempt to coerce Vasquez. The Des Moines Register reported during my eventual trial that numerous Iowa officials had \u201cdenied threats by McCoy, and insisted that no single senator would have the power to influence purchasing decisions\u201d by the state.\n\nHowever, not satisfied with snaring just me in their net, the agents went on to say that if I gave them the names of other elected officials engaged in illegal activities, the district court might be inclined to look favorably on me. The district office was led by a prosecutor named Matt Whitaker, then the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa. Whitaker, an avowed conservative who has run for state office multiple times as a Republican, was part of what would come to be widely considered a politically motivated effort by the Department of Justice to investigate Democratic officeholders.\n\nAt the time, David Yepsen of the Register wrote: \u201cIt appears the U.S. attorney, Matt Whitaker, is aggressively going after the city\u2019s south-side Democratic organization and the way it does business.\u201d You could call it due diligence, and, to be clear, the investigation and secret recording of my conversations was done in a fully legal manner. But if you consider Whitaker\u2019s naked partisanship, as Yepsen did, and the fact that a study at the time showed that the Ashcroft and Gonzales Departments of Justice prosecuted Democrats to an extent grossly disproportionate to Republicans, you could refer to it as something very different. In Whitaker\u2019s own recent words: a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nThe FBI agents who visited me that day were saying that if I snitched on my Senate colleagues, Whitaker\u2019s office might be lenient with me. This is all standard practice for the Department of Justice, of course, and similar to the tactics that special counsel Robert Mueller, who Whitaker has repeatedly criticized, has used in his ongoing investigation\u2014but ignoring the fact that I had no knowledge of what I was supposed to have done illegally, let alone knowledge of illegal actions on the part of others, I would never have played that game.\n\nThis was the first I knew I was under federal scrutiny. The FBI paid Vasquez to record 12 hours of our conversations. They turned over the tapes to the grand jury. The jury returned a one-count indictment against me for attempted extortion under the Hobbs Act, which more specifically is a federal anti-racketeering law used in cases involving public corruption. It sets a low bar for conviction of public officials. The charge stemmed from the threat to form my own company. The FBI admitted to paying at least $2,200 to Vasquez for clandestinely taping our conversations. If I were convicted, it could have meant a $250,000 fine and 20 years imprisonment.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s entire case was built on the word of Vasquez, the star witness, whose credibility was undermined by a litany of personal issues he acknowledged under oath. In cross-examination, Vasquez had amnesia. \u201cI can\u2019t recall,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t remember\u201d was his response to over 100 questions.\n\nThat the FBI paid Vasquez for his testimony was unheard of. The former editor of the Des Moines Register\u2019s editorial page, Gilbert Cranberg, stated, \u201cThe local criminal defense bar was stunned that the government had to pay the alleged victim for his help prosecuting his purported victimizer,\u201d in an editorial for the Nieman Watchdog. In a local news journal, he wrote: \u201cWas McCoy\u2019s prosecution a product of poor judgment, inexperience, misplaced zeal or partisan politicking? Perhaps some or all of the above.\u201d\n\nI was eventually acquitted after the jury deliberated for less than 25 minutes, according to the foreman. Cranberg noted in the Register, \u201cThe case against McCoy was so anorexic that not one of the 12 jurors considered it worth protracted consideration.\u201d One of my attorneys, Montgomery Brown, stated, \u201cNinety percent of federal court cases result in a conviction, and the swift \u2018not guilty\u2019 verdict indicates something was seriously wrong with Whitaker\u2019s case.\u201d\n\nU.S. attorneys conveniently \u201cforgot\u201d that they approved to pay Vasquez to covertly tape his conversations with me, a revelation that came out in the wind-up to my trial. There were no consequences for this. In denying our motion to dismiss the case, the court said this was an unfortunate \u201clapse of memory.\u201d Had I had such a lapse, I would have been cuffed and hauled off to prison.\n\nAccording to my attorney, Jerry Crawford, during the trial he walked over to the prosecuting attorneys and asked them to save face, saying, \u201cPull this case now. I\u2019m embarrassed for the United States of America.\u201d Both of the attorneys he spoke to, one of whom had been flown in from Washington, D.C., by the DOJ, said they were instructed to carry out the case to its fullest extent. Somebody in Washington\u2014or in Whitaker\u2019s office\u2014was making this call, and the trial prosecutors didn\u2019t have control over it. They knew they were out-lawyered, and they were getting slaughtered daily in court. But they couldn\u2019t bring it to a close, which would have saved them both money and time.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s office clearly wanted to give the evangelical right within the Republican Party a trophy, and that trophy was me\u2014one of the state\u2019s most prominent young Democrats at the time. Whitaker is a social conservative who supported the Iowa Christian Alliance, the pre-eminent group in the state for like-minded conservatives. In 2014, he was executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civil Trust (FACT), a conservative watchdog, which Slate described as a \u201cDark Money-Funded Clinton Antagonist \u2026 [which] largely publicized what it described as ethical lapses by prominent Democrats and requested that government agencies and law enforcement investigate them.\u201d\n\nPeople should be very concerned with Whitaker\u2019s elevation to acting attorney general. The DOJ is supposed to be blind to politics. Whitaker clearly is not.\n\nAt the time, I did not realize the full implications of what was happening to me, which had echoes in national politics. The U.S. attorney general at the time, Alberto Gonzales, was involved in a scandal in which he was accused of firing eight U.S. prosecutors, who were all previously in good standing with the DOJ, for political reasons. The aforementioned study from the time suggests the DOJ was attacking the Democratic Party at its grass roots. Their insinuations of corruption sapped local Democrats of energy and created suspicion among their constituents.\n\nAt the time, the national Democratic Party had named me among the 100 up-and-coming Democratic leaders to watch. I was young. I was liberal. I was popular. I had never been defeated. I had flirted with running for Congress. And I was openly gay, which surely didn\u2019t increase my popularity with social conservatives like Whitaker. Steve Deace, the conservative talk radio host, hosted Whitaker on his show in 2007 and referred to me derogatorily as \u201copenly homo.\u201d Whitaker said nothing, aside from protesting in favor of his impartiality. He said to Deace that he was \u201cpersonally offended\u201d by such accusations of partisanship, and that he \u201c[didn\u2019t] have time to direct investigations that I'm not specifically working on myself.\u201d\n\nWhitaker has attempted to establish his own career in Iowa politics. He lost a run for state treasurer in 2002, lost a Republican primary bid for the U.S. Senate in 2014, and was not selected for a seat on the Iowa Supreme Court despite angling for the job. It\u2019s hard to believe he could carry out the important job of United States attorney general with a sense of fealty to the law and to the Constitution, rather than to the Republican Party.\n\nThe government\u2019s invasion of my privacy during the case Whitaker\u2019s office brought against me was hardly unusual for such an investigation, but considering my innocence and exculpation it was appalling: I was followed, my conversations were recorded, and my financial records were seized. Family members, co-workers, legislative colleagues and acquaintances were questioned. My emails were read. The emails and financial records of a business colleague were subpoenaed. My reputation and future were damaged. The emotional stress took its toll on my physical and mental health. I lost both actual and potential income, along with my savings. When the DOJ wields its power in a partisan manner, it ruins lives. Whitaker almost ruined mine.\n\nI left in debt, and with and a shattered sense of security. Whitaker left noting his \u201ccomplete confidence in the jury system.\u201d\n\nHopefully that confidence endures to this day, regardless of what such a jury might have to say about his new benefactor.\n\nMatt McCoy is a State Senator from Iowa's 21st District.", "POLITICO Playbook: Dems lay out investigation priorities Presented by\n\n\"I\u2019m not going to be handing out subpoenas like somebody\u2019s handing out candy on Halloween,\" Rep.

Early Saturday, the White House announced Trump and the first lady had scuttled plans, due to bad weather, for their first stop in the weekend\u2019s remembrance activities \u2014 a visit to the solemn Aisne Marne American Cemetery, marking the ferocious Battle of Belleau Wood.\n\n\u201cIt was not completely clear why the Trumps were unable to attend. The cemetery is 50 miles from Paris. Perhaps the president was planning to travel on Marine One, which is occasionally grounded by the Secret Service. But the sight of dignitaries arriving at other sites outside Paris, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, led some foreign policy analysts to speculate the U.S. commander in chief just wasn\u2019t up for it.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- NANCY COOK in Paris -- \u201cTrump\u2019s rain decision casts dark clouds over his Paris trip\u201d: \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s decision to cancel his visit to an American military cemetery outside of Paris threatened to overshadow his trip here, as government officials, historians, and fellow Republicans hammered him for more than 24 hours for that move.\n\n\u201c\u2018President @realDonaldTrump a no-show because of raindrops?

Sinema now has 49.5 percent of the vote to McSally\u2019s 48.2 percent, with hundreds of thousands more votes still left to count.\u201d POLITICO\n\nIN FLORIDA \u2026\n\n-- Scott: Nelson is \u2018trying to commit fraud to win\u2019 Florida\u2019s Senate race,\u201d by Brent D.

Before the recount was ordered, he remained in front by just over 12,000 votes as Democrat-rich counties like Broward County continued to report additional numbers.\n\nScott repeated his allegations Sunday, without evidence, that fraud is behind the increase in votes for Nelson; both Scott and President Donald Trump have accused Democrats of trying to \"steal\" the election.\n\nScott\u2019s comments, stopping short of actually accusing Nelson of committing fraud directly, concern two issues that surfaced after Election Day.\n\nIn one case, Nelson\u2019s team of lawyers objected to Palm Beach County\u2019s election canvassing board from canceling a ballot cast by a noncititzen, who is barred from voting. In another case, Nelson\u2019s lawyers are asking a judge to allow all absentee ballots to count, including those where the signature on the mail-in envelope doesn\u2019t match the signature of the voter in file. The signature-match rule is designed to prevent people from fraudulently casting a ballot on behalf of another, but the rule had led to tens of thousands of ballots cast by lawful voters to be canceled \u2014 including former Congressman and 2016 US Senate candidate Patrick Murphy.\n\nThe governor also said he has asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to look into potential fraud. The department and the secretary of state, both agencies Scott oversees as governor, have both previously said there is no evidence of fraud.\n\nNelson and his legal team have insisted that the increase in votes for the incumbent is simply due to the fact that more votes were being counted.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

The weather, similar to Saturday, is rainy and overcast.", "One evening this fall at a house in West Hollywood, the Australian editor and writer Claire Lehmann had dinner with the neuroscientist Sam Harris and Eric Weinstein, the managing director of tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel\u2019s investment firm. Joe Rogan, the podcast host, joined later on, when the group decamped to a comedy club.\n\nYou could think of the gathering as a board meeting of sorts for the \u201cintellectual dark web,\u201d or IDW, a loose cadre of academics, journalists and tech entrepreneurs who view themselves as standing up to the knee-jerk left-leaning politics of academia and the media. Over the past year, the IDW has arisen as a puzzling political force, made up of thinkers who support \u201cEnlightenment values\u201d and accuse the left of setting dangerously illiberal limits on acceptable thought. The IDW has defined itself mainly by diving into third-rail topics like the genetics of gender and racial difference\u2014territory that seems even more fraught in the era of #MeToo and the Trump resistance. But part of the attraction of the IDW is the sense that many more people agree with its principles than can come forward publicly: The dinner host on this night, Lehmann says, was a famous person she would prefer not to name.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOver steaks, Lehmann recalls, the conversation revolved around a brewing academic scandal, a prank engineered by friends of hers. They had successfully placed seven nonsensical research papers in various academic journals devoted to what they characterized as \u201cgrievance studies.\u201d One of the papers included a lengthy passage from Adolf Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf, rewritten to focus on feminism and intersectionality. Another was about rape culture in dog parks. Absurd as the papers were, they had been accepted by expert editors and published as serious research. For those in attendance, it was a ringing confirmation of just how politicized academia had become, and how blindly devoted to fashionable moralities.\n\nIt was also a big story for Quillette, the online magazine Lehmann runs and the unofficial digest of the IDW. Lehmann had known about the prank before the Wall Street Journal broke the news, and she had some time to formulate a response that would fan the flames. \u201cI wanted the public to be aware that there are many people within the academy who are fed up with grievance studies scholarship,\u201d says Lehmann, who went on to publish responses from five like-minded academics\u2014one of whom called the incident \u201ca Cultural Revolution in our own backyard.\u201d\n\nFor readers and thinkers who regard themselves as intellectually curious but feel alienated from the lock-step politics of universities and the broader left, Quillette has become a haven for stories like this\u2014and topics treated as taboo elsewhere. At times, it has drawn intense social media backlash, with contributors labeled everything from \u201cclowns\u201d to \u201ccryptofascists\u201d on Twitter. But fans of the site include pop psychologist Jordan Peterson, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, psychology professors Steven Pinker of Harvard and Jonathan Haidt of New York University, and columnists like David Brooks, Meghan Daum and Andrew Sullivan. \u201cI continue to be impressed that Quillette publishes heterodox but intellectually serious and non-inflammatory pieces [about] ideas that have become near-taboo in academic and intellectual discourse,\u201d Pinker wrote to me in an email, \u201cincluding ones connected to heritability, sex and sex differences, race, culture, Islam, free speech and violence.\u201d Haidt, co-author of the recent book The Coddling of the American Mind, called Quillette in an email \u201ca gathering place for people who love to play with ideas and hate being told that there are ideas they are not supposed to play with.\u201d\n\nWHERE QUILLETTE IS WILLING TO GO Racial, Ethnic and Religious Identity\n\nThis kind of prominence hardly seemed inevitable when Lehmann, now 33, founded Quillette in 2015. She was pregnant and had recently decided against finishing her master\u2019s degree in forensic psychology. The site, with the tagline \u201ca platform for free thought,\u201d began as a repository for psychologists, particularly evolutionary ones, to write in an accessible way about topics relating to human nature. Contributors often shared Lehmann\u2019s interest in debunking the \u201cblank slate\u201d theory of human development, which postulates that individuals are largely products of nurture, not nature. But, Lehmann told me, it quickly grew beyond that topic. In \u201csetting up a space where we could critique the blank slate orthodoxy,\u201d she says, Quillette \u201chas naturally evolved into a place where people critique other aspects of what they see as left-wing orthodoxy.\u201d\n\nQuillette now publishes roughly seven to 10 articles each week. The suppression of free speech on campus is a big theme, as is the reality of sex difference and the revisiting of post-colonial relations\u2014all in their own way denunciations of what Lehmann describes as the left\u2019s \u201cpurity politics.\u201d The list of the site\u2019s all-time Top 10 most-read articles includes \u201cThe Psychology of Progressive Hostility,\u201d \u201cI Was the Mob Until the Mob Came for Me\u201d and \u201cWhy Women Don\u2019t Code.\u201d (Short answer: Because they don\u2019t want to.) Quillette\u2019s rapid-fire response in support of James Damore, the writer of the notorious \u201cGoogle memo\u201d that criticized attempts to promote women and minorities within the organization, was so popular that the site crashed. (Lehmann\u2019s tech support team told her it could have been a successful denial-of-service attack.) And when the writer Stephen Elliott wanted to protest his inclusion on the widely circulated \u201cShitty Media Men\u201d list, he turned to Quillette, which published his essay, \u201cHow an Anonymous Accusation Derailed My Life,\u201d this fall. (Shortly after the article ran, Elliott sued the creator of the list, Moira Donegan, for $1.5 million in damages.) But Quillette\u2019s editorial mix is more unpredictable than these greatest hits might suggest; recently, a treatise against thank-you notes led the site for a few days.\n\nOver a 30-day period this fall, Quillette received north of 2 million page views\u2014more than the New York Review of Books, and more than Harper\u2019s and Tablet combined, according to data Lehmann provided from the analytics service Alexa. Twitter, the forum of choice for contrarians, is the site\u2019s biggest driver of traffic. Lehmann herself has more than 100,000 followers, and giants like Peterson and Pinker regularly tweet links to Quillette articles. In June, Peterson, who has encouraged his followers to donate to the site, tweeted, \u201cQuillette gives me hope for the future of journalism.\u201d\n\nThe suppression of free speech on campus is a big theme, as is the reality of sex difference and the revisiting of post-colonial relations.\n\nLehmann, though, doesn\u2019t think of herself as a journalist. When I spoke with her by phone from her home in Sydney, she said she\u2019s not even very interested in politics. And as a woman and an Australian, she is an unusual gatekeeper for a group that is mostly male and almost entirely American. (They\u2019re also mostly, though not all, white, as is Lehmann.) \u201cI\u2019m an outsider to the debate,\u201d Lehmann concedes. \u201cI think that helps.\u201d Whether you think the magazine is a \u201csafe space for academics and others with novel ideas who feel stifled by oppressive social and speech norms,\u201d as Lehmann herself does, or a \u201chub for reactionary thought,\u201d per the website the Outline, Quillette keeps appearing in roiling controversies about speech and identity, so much so that what started as a niche destination for evolutionary psychologists is now on the front lines of the culture wars. Yet, with its increased popularity comes greater scrutiny of Quillette\u2019s controversial ideas\u2014as well as the risk that its mostly dry, academic discussion could become flash points for extremists. Just how far will Quillette go in its devotion to iconoclasm?\n\n\n\n***\n\nLong before she launched Quillette, Lehmann says, she had found herself out of step with her peer group in the academic world. At the University of Adelaide, she started out as an English major but recoiled from the emphasis on post-structuralist theory, which she believed to be a set of \u201cbad and faulty\u201d ideas. (\u201cI read Foucault and thought it was bullshit,\u201d she says.) She wound up graduating in 2010 with a psychology degree and worked for a year in Australia\u2019s capital city of Canberra at the Department of Health. \u201cMy first week, I was tasked with writing letters, and I was immediately told I was completing the task too quickly,\u201d Lehmann says. \u201cIt was like a Kafka novel.\u201d The daughter of an artist and a child-care worker, she had grown up comfortably ensconced in Adelaide\u2019s urban left. On seeing the inefficiencies and waste of public funds firsthand, she turned away from the politics of her upbringing.\n\nMark Metcalfe for Politico Magazine\n\nLehmann, who talks slowly and carefully, with a scientific precision, describes herself as \u201ccentrist.\u201d But like many of Quillette\u2019s ilk, her views are not easy to locate on the political spectrum. Although she calls herself a feminist\u2014she cites maternity leave and other \u201cpolicies that focus on women\u2019s role as carers\u201d as issues important to her\u2014she is very much out of the feminist mainstream, as her first forays into opinion writing demonstrated.\n\n\u201cProgressive public commentators do not like to admit that marriage is actually good for women and children, or that a happy marriage is associated with better well-being, longevity and lifetime health,\u201d went Lehmann\u2019s first op-ed, in the Sydney Morning Herald, in 2013. She also argued that \u201chaving a male breadwinner around actually makes life a great deal easier\u201d for women and children. Lehmann had by that time left Canberra for Sydney, where she was pursuing her graduate psychology degree and was also about to marry her now-husband, who runs his own real estate startup.\n\nA longtime Herald columnist, Paul Sheehan, had approached her about writing for the newspaper after discovering her on Twitter. \u201cWhat Paul said to me was I was one of the only young people he noticed who weren\u2019t full of cynicism,\u201d Lehmann says. \u201cI was expressing earnest opinions.\u201d Although she never imagined herself a columnist and the feedback to her initial piece, she told me, was \u201cincredibly nasty,\u201d Lehmann enjoyed the writing process and wanted to do more. Sheehan, a controversial conservative who over a 30-year career at the Herald decried, among other things, multiculturalism, Muslim culture and overstep in sexual assault cases, wrote to me in an email that he was \u201cimmediately struck by the elegance of her posts. ... She did not follow the herd.\u201d\n\nWHERE QUILLETTE IS WILLING TO GO Gender and #MeToo\n\nIt is worth noting that the herd in Australia, a nation of about 25 million people, is pretty small. Rupert Murdoch owns more than 60 percent of the daily newspapers sold in the country, so there are not all that many platforms. As Lehmann tells it, she was eager to keep writing for the paper but was shut out by a feminist clique of editors. On YouTube, there is a 2017 interview with Lehmann by Ezra Levant, an excitable Canadian who runs the right-wing website Rebel Media. As the two stand beside the steps of the Sydney Opera House, squinting into the sun, Lehmann says, \u201cI particularly wanted to criticize feminism, and I couldn\u2019t get published in the Australian media if I was critical of feminism. ... I was blacklisted.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Lehmann was indeed blacklisted from what is arguably Australia\u2019s most respected newspaper, which in turn led her to start her own publication, remains relevant. Cries of victimhood, or of being silenced for voicing unpopular viewpoints, are common grievances among her site\u2019s contributors. Free-speech activists often depict themselves as embattled defenders of reason, even when they speak from positions of power. Lehmann mentioned to me that one editor in particular was determined to shut her out from the Herald and had even tried to ban her. But when I asked that editor, Sarah Oakes, who at the time led the women\u2019s vertical Daily Life, she disputed Lehmann\u2019s account and said she had to google the name to jog her memory. \u201cI never thought it was a good fit,\u201d Oakes wrote in an email. \u201cI certainly never \u2018banned\u2019 her and in my recollection I never spoke to her directly.\u201d (Full disclosure: I am a contributing writer to the Herald\u2019s weekend magazine and have written for Oakes before, though not while she was at the Herald.)\n\nI particularly wanted to criticize feminism, and I couldn\u2019t get published in the Australian media if I was critical of feminism. \u2026 I was blacklisted.\u201d\n\nEveryone agrees, at least, on the awesome rapidity of what happened next, which is that Lehmann set up her own website in less than two weeks. Her provocative columns could have found a home at Murdoch\u2019s conservative broadsheet the Australian, perhaps, but by then Lehmann had fallen in with an international crowd of psychologists on Twitter, and had set her sights on a bigger stage. Besides, the Australian, she says, was \u201cpartisan and narrow,\u201d and she wanted to do something \u201cfresh and interesting.\u201d Peter Thiel\u2019s Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future, which she was reading at the time, \u201cgave me the inspiration to do my own venture,\u201d she says. As Sheehan puts it: \u201cShe created Quillette in her living room, with no staff, while having a second baby, and teaching herself coding, and catching the train to a part-time job.\u201d\n\nQuillette, which has three other editors who work remotely, operates without advertising, but, according to Lehmann, it is turning a profit. Patreon, a crowdfunding platform, is Quillette\u2019s primary source of revenue, which is steadily growing; in September, Patreon donations brought in $19,000. In addition, Lehmann says the site has \u201ca few supporters\u201d in California who send some money every quarter. Although all the editors are paid, only Lehmann and one other work full time on the site. Writers have been paid from the start. About half the stories are commissioned, at a rate of 400 Australian dollars per article (less than $300 U.S.), and the rest are unsolicited manuscripts, for which Quillette pays less. Lehmann says she is not \u201cliving in luxury,\u201d but, \u201cI\u2019m making a living off the site now.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nToday, Lehmann admits Quillette has become something different from what she first envisioned. \u201cI thought we would be more oriented towards scientific discussions,\u201d she says, but it is the site\u2019s heterodox articles about politics, culture and the academy that have attracted broader attention.\n\n...

In it, Hill says that a mathematical paper he wrote about the possible evolutionary underpinnings of gender differences was pulled from two separate journals after an intimidation campaign by academic activists. I\u2019m not a mathematician and am not able to adjudicate the validity of Hill\u2019s research, which Lehmann tells me underwent two weeks of fact-checking by one of her editors. But Andrew Gelman, a statistician at Columbia University, wrote a post on his personal blog saying that Hill had \u201cno direct evidence\u201d that the paper had been discarded based on politics, rather than merit. \u201cThe most unfortunate part of the story,\u201d Gelman wrote, \u201cis the amplification of Hill\u2019s post throughout Twitter, Quillette, 4chan, etc., abetted by thought leaders on Twitter, leading to noxious hatred spewed at Amie Wilkinson.\u201d (Wilkinson is a math professor Hill had blamed for suppressing his work.)\n\n\u201cNoxious hatred,\u201d and in particular misogyny, is rife in the comments on Hill\u2019s article; the phrase \u201cvaginal privilege\u201d makes an appearance, as do predictable tirades against \u201cwhiny\u201d feminists. Lehmann says she regrets not moderating those comments but that she isn\u2019t worried about reasonable arguments on Quillette\u2019s website being hijacked by unreasonable people. \u201cWe\u2019ve become a place where people who don\u2019t fit perfectly into a little box or a label can feel at home and not under pressure to identify with one tribe or another,\u201d she says. I was curious, though, if there were certain political positions Lehmann would disavow, either personally or as an editor. Lehmann says that because she is an atheist, she feels alienated from the Christian right. \u201cI would identify with the left if they were a little more old-school in their advocacy for workers,\u201d she allowed, \u201cbut I\u2019m not too bothered to be aligned with a political movement.\u201d\n\nBut, I pressed, is she worried about extremists using Quillette articles about inflammatory matters like race and gender to validate their views? \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be considered provocateurs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe never publish anything about Milo Yiannopoulos\u201d\u2014the British polemicist formerly of Breitbart\u2014\u201cand we never defended him even though I would agree with him on free speech issues. We never respected his methods of causing outrage for the sake of it.\u201d She did say that she wouldn\u2019t want Quillette to be associated with \u201canything like ethno-nationalism\u201d or \u201cracist, bigoted viewpoints.\u201d Ultimately, Lehmann says she can\u2019t take responsibility for how posts will be interpreted. \u201cIf we are constantly inhibiting ourselves because we\u2019re worried about people misusing our work,\u201d she says, \u201cthat presents its own ethical problem and leads to a corrosion of honesty.\u201d\n\nIs Lehmann worried about extremists using Quillette articles to validate their views? \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be considered provocateurs,\u201d she says.\n\nBen Winegard, an assistant professor of psychology at Hillsdale College, a small Christian school in Michigan, isn\u2019t as sanguine as Lehmann. In 2016, he co-authored an article for Quillette titled \u201cOn the Reality of Race and the Abhorrence of Racism,\u201d arguing that race exists and corresponds to genetic differences, and that denying this fact \u201cleaves a vacuum for extremists to exploit.\u201d It\u2019s not something Winegard, who identifies as a \u201cNew Deal Democrat,\u201d would write today. \u201cI have had to stop writing about race because it\u2019s just so toxic and not even responsible to do,\u201d he told me. Winegard remains an avid Quillette reader and says the work it does is \u201cimportant.\u201d But there are risks inherent in a research forum raising difficult questions about gender, race and intelligence, he says: Young people might glom on with a wrongheaded view of the data. He also worries that the site, ironically, is becoming an echo chamber in the name of radical openness. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk,\u201d he says, \u201cthat it does just become an outlet for a lot of people who feel grievances about identity politics and political correctness.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not as though Lehmann wants an echo chamber, either. \u201cI want to give more of a platform for people on the left who are in support of liberal values,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want to get more conservatives who feel disillusioned with whatever conservative bubble they\u2019re in.\u201d Winegard told me with admiration that he didn\u2019t know what Lehmann\u2019s own politics are, exactly, and she told me she doesn\u2019t agree with everything she publishes.\n\n\u201cSometimes there are misrepresentations, and people assume that my politics is far more right-wing than it actually is,\u201d she says. \u201cI think because I\u2019m Australian, and I take so many things for granted like universal health care, access to abortion, and we don\u2019t have guns everywhere.\u201d\n\nWHERE QUILLETTE IS WILLING TO GO Defying the Left\n\nThis is a theme to which Lehmann returns: From outside the United States, she is not \u201cemotionally invested\u201d in American politics and so can better diagnose that country\u2019s pathology. \u201cEveryone in the U.S. is lost in the weeds. They\u2019re focusing on the minutiae of what\u2019s happening to Trump,\u201d she says, or \u201cgetting upset over Nike sponsoring that NFL player. ... We don\u2019t feel the need to constantly follow what\u2019s in the news.\u201d Lehmann has consciously hired Canadian and British editors, and one thing that is generally absent on the site is coverage of Donald Trump. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to inevitably choose a side in America. You can\u2019t just sit in the middle,\u201d says Mark Carnegie, an Australian venture capitalist and a backer of the site. Quillette is powerful, he says, because it\u2019s \u201can independent media voice.\u201d\n\nLehmann has two children now, ages 5 and 2, and she is happy to have built herself a self-sustaining, family-friendly career. Her plans for Quillette are to keep doing what it does, at scale. She recently announced a new slate of columnists and launched a Quillette podcast she is co-hosting, featuring interviews with contributors. It\u2019s all part of the site\u2019s efforts to \u201cbroaden the Overton window,\u201d Lehmann says\u2014referring to a term that originated in the late 1990s as a synonym for reasonable political discourse but more recently has been hijacked by the alt-right in an attempt to normalize extreme rhetoric. For Quillette to avoid the same fate will require vigilance. \u201cIt will never be a completely mainstream publication,\u201d Lehmann says. \u201cWe just want to capture the highly educated but open-minded, curious, heterodox audience wherever they are.\u201d\n\nAmelia Lester is an Australian writer living in Japan.", "The Year Was 1976. Republicans were reeling from Watergate. Christian conservatives were defecting to the Democratic Party. And Jerry Falwell, the Virginia preacher with a booming Baptist congregation and a popular radio show, decided he could no longer sit on the sidelines as he saw American culture succumbing to the creeping forces of secularism. The precipitating event was an interview given by Jimmy Carter, in which the Democratic presidential nominee admitted to having \u201clooked on a lot of women with lust,\u201d and \u201ccommitted adultery in my heart many times.\u201d Carter had never acted on such temptation, he implied, but the admission kept him humble: \u201cChrist says, don\u2019t consider yourself better than someone else because one guy screws a whole bunch of women while the other guy is loyal to his wife.\u201d\n\nThe doctrine itself was not objectionable. But the language\u2014and more crucially, the venue\u2014was intolerable for Falwell. The interview had run in Playboy magazine, alongside nude photographs of Miss November and articles such as \u201cThe Vatican Sex Manual\u201d and \u201cPrurient Puritans.\u201d In his televised Sunday sermons, Falwell began railing against Carter\u2019s courtship of the randy men\u2019s magazine and its 5 million readers. When Carter\u2019s team tried to block one of his antagonistic sermons from being broadcast shortly before Election Day, claiming it violated the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s Fairness Doctrine, Falwell raised the stakes. He assembled a group of leading fundamentalist ministers at the National Press Club in Washington and accused Carter of \u201cmuzzling a preacher of the gospel from preaching his moral convictions.\u201d The press conference, which cemented Falwell\u2019s status as an ascendant political heavyweight, would be looked back on as the inception of the Moral Majority.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt was the height of the porn wars. More than abortion or homosexuality, the rising tide of pornography in America was, in the 1970s, becoming central to conservative Americans\u2019 perception of a civilization in decline. For faith leaders, it was an easily exploitable issue; for Falwell, it was a crusade. He fought to remove adult content from convenience stores. He went to court to battle Hustler and Penthouse. And he never forgave Carter\u2014who ended up winning the White House in 1976, carrying the evangelical vote along the way\u2014for his original sin of talking to Hugh Hefner\u2019s publication. \u201cGiving an interview to Playboy magazine was lending the credence and the dignity of the highest office in the land to a salacious, vulgar magazine that did not even deserve the time of his day,\u201d Falwell said in 1981.\n\nForty years after that D.C. press conference, a very different scene unfolded. This one took place in New York and starred Jerry Falwell Jr., inheritor of the family business. Hours earlier, the younger Falwell had introduced the GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump to a massive gathering of Christian leaders, calling him \u201cGod\u2019s man,\u201d anointed to lead the nation in turbulent times. The summit was successful beyond anyone\u2019s expectation. As they celebrated back at Trump Tower, Falwell sought to document the occasion with a photo. The future president stood in the middle, flanked by Falwell Jr. and his wife, Becki. Thumbs went up. The camera snapped. Falwell tweeted the photo to his 60,000 followers. There was just one hiccup: Lurking over Becki Falwell\u2019s left shoulder, framed in gold, was a cover of Playboy, graced by a bow-tied Trump and a smiling brunette covered only by his tuxedo jacket.\n\nThe photo sparked a frenzy. Nothing, it seemed, could so neatly encapsulate the religious right\u2019s backsliding as Falwell Jr. giving a thumbs-up in front of the very magazine his father had singled out as symbolic of America\u2019s moral decay\u2014while standing shoulder to shoulder with a man who had appeared in a softcore porno flick and who reportedly, as Jimmy Carter might have put it, screwed a bunch of women outside of marriage, including a Playboy model and hardcore adult-film actress.\n\nAnd it highlighted something else just as striking: the total abandonment of pornography as a battleground in America\u2019s culture war.\n\nClockwise from top left: Rev.

Scott Mahaskey/Politico\n\n***\n\nFrom the 1960s through the turn of the century, pornography played a dominant role in the American political argument\u2014its morality and legality, its restrictions and regulations, its implications and unintended consequences. It was treated as a matter of urgency not just by the religious right, which decried the hypersexualizing of society, but by the radical left, which denounced the objectifying of women. Liberal feminists and conservative evangelicals found themselves unexpectedly allied in vilifying the adult entertainment industry. After decades of intensifying conflict, Ronald Reagan convened a Presidential Commission on Pornography in 1985; two years later, Reagan held a press conference to announce his administration\u2019s plan to combat illegal obscenity\u2014and issue a warning to the porn professionals: \u201cYour industry\u2019s days are numbered.\u201d\n\nInstead, the industry exploded. Today, pornography in America is a societal phenomenon and an economic behemoth. As of late 2018, according to Alexa.com, five of the 50 most trafficked websites in the United States. belong to the adult industry. The biggest site, Pornhub, typically ranks around No. 15, in the neighborhood of titans like Netflix and ESPN. In 2017 alone, Pornhub hosted 28.5 billion visits, an average of 81 million per day, the overwhelming majority based in America. All told, visitors to Pornhub last year searched 50,000 times per minute and 800 times per second. And that\u2019s one website\u2014merely the brightest star in a boundless constellation of explicit content.\n\nWe know that the ubiquity of porn is a problem: Even as experts debate the science of addiction and the link between consumption and destructive behavior, there is surefire sociological evidence of its exacerbating influence on those most susceptible\u2014people predisposed to violence, for instance, or misogyny or child abuse. There is also consensus that it has, in plenty of cases, contributed to abusive relationships and the fracturing of families. And that\u2019s just where adults are concerned. Millions of kids today are watching porn, a freedom afforded to the smartphone generation, leaving parents, educators and clinicians increasingly anxious. If ever there were a national dialogue needed about porn\u2014if ever there were a moment for some opportunistic politician to make a cause of it\u2014the time would be now.\n\nMillions of kids today are watching porn, a freedom afforded to the smartphone generation, leaving parents, educators and clinicians increasingly anxious.\n\nInstead, the battlefield has been deserted. When a group of conservatives met last year with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, they hoped to convince him of the need for a return to rigorous Reagan-era prosecution of obscenity. Sessions, a staunch social conservative and longtime Sunday school teacher, shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough resources to combat child pornography,\u201d Sessions said, according to attendees, \u201cmuch less to enforce obscenity laws.\u201d\n\nWith the internet offering an ever-expanding breadth of content, and smartphones and laptops replacing squalid movie houses and black-curtained storefronts, resistance to porn is beginning to feel futile.\n\n\u201cIs this a winnable war? I don\u2019t know,\u201d says Donna Rice Hughes, a longtime anti-porn activist whose organization, Enough Is Enough, encourages a safer internet for kids. \u201cIn these cultural battles, the oxygen gets sucked out of the room after so many losses. Today, you\u2019ve got extreme porn as the new normal\u2014not just for adults, but for our kids. So it\u2019s a demoralization due to so many losses and so much collateral damage.\u201d Hughes adds, \u201cWhen you have a nonprofit like mine, donors want to see progress. And to be honest, we haven\u2019t seen any.\u201d\n\nThe political class has largely gone silent. Over a decade spent covering Republican politics, I struggle to recall instances of politicians calling attention to pornography. The lone exception: Diane Black, a congresswoman running this year for governor of Tennessee, blamed the rise in school shootings on adolescent porn habits. She was widely ridiculed and ultimately lost the GOP primary. Her comment was a cautionary tale. Black had attacked a multibillion-dollar industry\u2014one trafficked by many of her constituents\u2014and the only dent made was to her own reputation.\n\nIllustration by Alvaro Dominguez\n\nAmerica is an exception in this sense. Many governments around the world aggressively police erotic content; even the liberal nation of Iceland has toyed with a sweeping ban on pornography. A controversial British law requiring internet users to be registered and age-verified before accessing adult websites is expected to be implemented by year\u2019s end. There is no prospect for such action on this side of the Atlantic, in part because the First Amendment\u2019s protections are so strong, but also because political appetite is so weak. In lieu of legislative intervention, advocacy groups work the edges of the issue, pressuring companies such as McDonald\u2019s, Subway, Starbucks and Panera Bread to install filters on their free Wi-Fi networks. This, at least philosophically, represents a conservative\u2019s dream: civic society stepping up to address a problem government cannot solve. But these efforts can go only so far. It has become evident over the past half-century that in this particular theater of the culture war, high-level government action is a prerequisite for victory. Without it, defeat has become certain.\n\nWhat happened? The pervasiveness of porn is a reminder that politics historically hasn\u2019t been much of a bulwark against the most primitive human desires\u2014money, power, sex and, in this instance, a combination of the three. But it\u2019s also a window into the mentality on the right, which has surrendered the fight on many social issues as America has moved left. Even with Trump in the White House and five conservatives on the Supreme Court, there is no reversing the cultural tides that have swept away the Moral Majority\u2019s footprint on supporting traditional marriage and prayer in public schools. The difference is that some on the right still pay lip service to those lost causes. When it comes to porn\u2014more accessible, more acceptable and less scrutinized than at any time during its history\u2014they don\u2019t even bother anymore.\n\n\n\n***\n\nNo archaeologist can explore a society without unearthing the remains of what we might now call pornography\u2014from prehistoric sketches of nude women on Ice Age cave walls to the bounty of explicit images and sculptures left behind by the Greeks and Romans. In 1524, with the printing press still less than a century old, the Italian engraver Marcantonio Raimondi published a book depicting 16 positions of sexual intercourse, copies of which spread throughout Europe. Raimondi was arrested and jailed by Pope Clement VII\u2014the first known collision between porn and politics.\n\nOne challenge faced by enforcers like Clement is that erotica has a nose for the underground. When British author John Cleland published his libidinous novel, Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure\u2014better known as Fanny Hill\u2014in 1748, he was imprisoned and charged with \u201ccorrupting the King\u2019s subjects.\u201d Cleland agreed to cease publication, but it was too late: The material had already been pirated, and replicas quickly proliferated around the Western Hemisphere. When a Massachusetts printer was shut down for distributing Fanny Hill in 1821, he took the case to the state Supreme Court\u2014and lost. Yet the cultural momentum was inexorable. The daguerreotype, a forerunner to the modern photograph, was introduced in 1839; as with the dawn of the internet a century and a half later, one of its primary functions was to reproduce and distribute sexual images.\n\nAmerican legislators tried to head off the problem with the Comstock Act of 1873, which banned mailing of \u201cobscene,\u201d \u201clewd,\u201d or \u201clascivious\u201d materials, but new laws couldn\u2019t keep pace with technology. First, it was halftone printing, which cheaply reproduced black-and-white images; then moving pictures, the earliest of which experimented with capturing nude women, igniting a black market of illegally filmed productions that grew steadily from the 1920s through World War II. American policymakers took an out-of-sight, out-of-mind approach, hoping to keep the smut quarantined to brothels and private parties; British authorities, fearing they had lost control, introduced the \u201cX\u201d rating in 1951. That same year, Modern Man published its first issue, which featured photos of nude women. Soon enough, the taboo became mainstream: Playboy hit newsstands in 1953 featuring Marilyn Monroe in the buff. The issue sold every one of its roughly 50,000 copies in a matter of weeks. Hugh Hefner had made soft-core pornography a popular commercial enterprise for the first time in the United States.\n\nHow the War on Porn Was Lost Anti-porn crusaders were facing an uphill battle, but they weren\u2019t going to lose without a fight. 1954 | Postmaster General v. Playboy\n\nThe Post Office refuses to deliver Playboy on obscenity grounds. The magazine sues and wins. 1957 | Roth v. United States\n\nA New York publisher known for publishing erotica, Samuel Roth, is convicted under a federal statute for mailing obscene materials. When he appealed to the Supreme Court on the grounds of First Amendment protection, the court ruled that obscenity was not protected speech. 1969 | Stanley v. Georgia\n\nAfter police obtain a warrant on suspicion of bookmaking, officers search the home of Robert Eli Stanley, where they find pornographic films. Stanley was convicted of possession of obscene materials under a state law. His case ultimately reaches the Supreme Court, which rules that states cannot criminalize private possession of obscene materials on grounds of privacy. 1970 | President Nixon Declares War on Porn\n\nThe National Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, created under President Lyndon B. Johnson, releases its report in October, during the Richard Nixon administration. Unable to find links between porn and crime, the commissioners advise against laws that restrict adults from purchasing sexually explicit materials. The president and the Senate reject their findings. \u201cSo long as I am in the White House, there will be no relaxation of the national effort to control and eliminate smut from our national life,\u201d Nixon says. 1973 | Miller v. California\n\nWhen Marvin Miller had mass mailed advertisements for pornographic books to a number of addresses, a mother-son duo who unwillingly received the explicit material complained to the police. Miller was convicted under a state statute, but he appealed, taking it all the way to the Supreme Court. In a landmark ruling, the court upholds his conviction and maintains that obscenity is not protected speech, while narrowing the definition of obscenity in a way that protects much of the controversial material in question. 1983 | Feminists Lead the Charge\u2014But the Courts Won\u2019t Have It\n\nWriter Andrea Dworkin and legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon partnered with anti-porn activists in the early 1980s to spread a new idea: laws that would allow women who have been harmed by pornography to pursue civil suits against producers and distributors. In 1983, the Minneapolis City Council hires Dworkin and Mackinnon to draft an anti-porn amendment to the city\u2019s civil rights ordinance. The ordinance is vetoed by the governor, and a similar measure in Indiana is ruled unconstitutional in an appeals court. 1986 | Reagan Reins in Porn\n\nOrdered by President Ronald Reagan, Attorney General Edwin Meese convenes a Commission on Pornography, which, in its final report, links consumption of pornographic material to sex crimes. Under Meese\u2019s guidance, the Department of Justice goes on the offensive against porn and, among other measures, creates a team of prosecutors to specifically handle pornography-related cases. 1997 | The Internet Challenge\n\nPresident Bill Clinton signs the Communications Decency Act into law in 1996, which bars publishers from posting indecent material \u201cin a manner available to a person under 18 years of age.\u201d Soon afterward, the Supreme Court rules that the law is unconstitutionally vague and would limit adults\u2019 access to materials, thus violating First Amendment rights to consumption of such material. 2000 | Blocking Websites at Schools\n\nCongress passes the Children\u2019s Internet Protection Act in 2000. Under this law, schools and libraries that receive federal funding must use internet filters to protect children from obscene content. Despite challenges, the legislation is upheld by the Supreme Court in 2003. 2002 | The FBI Takes on Child Pornography\n\nAttorney General John Ashcroft announces that Operation Candyman, a nationwide crackdown on child pornography, has charged 89 people with related crimes. 2016 | The Public Health Angle\n\nIn 2016, the Utah Legislature passes a nonbinding resolution that calls porn a public health hazard and calls for further research and policy changes to combat it. The resolution cites a range of concerns from \u201clow self-esteem\u201d to the \u201cnormalization of rape.\u201d\n\nGovernment opposition was strong. Hefner spent two years battling the U.S. postmaster general, who refused to deliver copies of the magazine because of its offensive content. In 1957, Samuel Roth, a New York publisher and distributor of adult materials, was tried and convicted of violating the Comstock Act. His case, Roth v. United States, went all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled 6-3 that \u201cobscenity\u201d was not protected under the First Amendment\u2014and gave the government power to prohibit material \u201cutterly without redeeming social importance.\u201d The threat posed by this ruling to a rapidly professionalizing industry was fleeting, however. By 1960, Playboy\u2019s circulation topped 1 million. It tripled by 1965 and topped 5 million by 1970, besting both Time and Newsweek.\n\nLegislators had, in previous decades, looked the other way. But given the confluence of developments in the 1960s\u2014an upsurge of explicit films, books and magazines; advances in the industry\u2019s equipment and distribution; as well as court rulings that chipped away at existing obscenity laws and strengthened individual privacy laws\u2014politicians could no longer ignore porn. In 1967, Congress authorized Lyndon B. Johnson to form a Presidential Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. In a preview of the deep political and cultural schisms that would open around the issue, the commission released two reports: the majority of members, liberals appointed by Johnson, downplayed the societal risks and actually suggested easing obscenity laws, while the minority of members, including a prominent conservative Catholic priest appointed by Richard Nixon after his 1968 victory, warned of grave implications and recommended vigorously enforcing those same laws.\n\nThe commission\u2019s dueling reports dropped in 1970, prompting Nixon to deliver fire-and-brimstone remarks calling for a wholesale ban on obscene material and declaring, \u201cSo long as I am in the White House, there will be no relaxation of the national effort to control and eliminate smut from our national life.\u201d Instead, the 1970s would come to be known as \u201cThe Golden Age of Porn.\u201d The profitability of high-production-quality films like \u201cDeep Throat\u201d was evidence of an accelerating sexual revolution. And there was a legal watershed in the form of Miller v. California, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that, on the 100th anniversary of the Comstock Act, redefined obscenity with a three-part test that invoked state law, artistic merit and \u201ccontemporary community standards.\u201d Technically it was\u2014and still is\u2014possible to outlaw pornography. But in practice the ruling meant that publishers and producers enjoyed such broad First Amendment protections that obscenity cases became nearly impossible to prosecute.\n\nThe implications were enormous and immediate: By decade\u2019s end, the top adult film stars were household names; Hustler was making Playboy look prudish by comparison; hundreds of X-rated movie theatres were opening nationwide; and for anyone worried about being spotted at an adult cinema, the VCR was starting to make home viewing a reality.\n\nIt was in this climate that serious, organized political opposition took root. It was led in part by conservative religious and political figures, most prominently Falwell and Paul Weyrich of The Heritage Foundation, men who pioneeringly understood the value of uniting faith leaders, defense hawks and wonky fiscal warriors under a banner that would become known as the conservative movement. In this particular fight, they were joined by some unlikely allies, most notably feminist leaders such as Gloria Steinem, Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon, who were working\u2014ultimately unsuccessfully\u2014to pass local ordinances giving more tools to push back against pornography. (The star of Deep Throat, Linda Lovelace, ultimately became a born-again Christian and an anti-porn advocate.)\n\n\u201cPornography\u201d appeared for the first time in the Republican Party\u2019s platform during Reagan\u2019s reelection campaign in 1984.\n\nReagan smartly harnessed the energy of this opposition, meeting with activists and promising action, but he did little in his first term to address the issue. \u201cPornography\u201d appeared for the first time in the Republican Party\u2019s platform during Reagan\u2019s reelection campaign in 1984. The next year, he convened a new presidential commission on porn, this one headed by Edwin Meese, the archconservative attorney general. Meese wanted to ensure this would not be a repeat of the Johnson-era academic exercise. He used the commission to build an Untouchables-style \u201cobscenity strike force\u201d that aimed to put the fear of the federal government into the porn industry, threatening retailers who legally sold soft-core magazines in a show of brute political force. (Hefner, a fan of free speech and fully nude pool parties, dubbed it \u201cSexual McCarthyism.\u201d)\n\nWhen it landed, the 1,960-page Meese Report surprised exactly no one: It concluded that pornography was a threat to society and recommended harsher enforcement of obscenity laws. In a particularly memorable passage, the report said the link between porn consumption and violence \u201crequires assumptions not found exclusively in the experimental evidence,\u201d yet concluded, \u201cWe see no reason, however, not to make these assumptions \u2026 that are plainly justified by our own common sense.\u201d The commission came under immediate criticism for its lack of scholarly rigor; academics whose work was cited by Meese protested the report\u2019s misapplication of their data, and even National Review concluded that the commission \u201chas to some extent found the conclusion it was looking for.\u201d That the report\u2019s findings were by and large empirically unsupported mattered not. Its recommendations allowed the Justice Department to execute what Reagan\u2019s supporters were agitating for: a crackdown on porn.\n\nOver the next five years, the federal government put obscenity on the back foot. The trick, legally speaking, was exploiting the \u201ccommunity standards\u201d described in Miller, allowing the feds to strategically target pornography producers who were marketing content in conservative parts of the country. At the same time, Meese rewrote Justice Department guidelines to allow for simultaneous obscenity prosecutions in multiple jurisdictions. This tactic worked: Indictments piled up and the adult industry\u2019s momentum slowed down. Congress got in on the action as well, banning \u201cdial-a-porn\u201d phone services and exploring a tightening of telecommunications laws to stem the tide of adult content. Emboldened, the GOP\u2019s 1992 platform called for \u201ca national crusade against pornography\u201d and endorsed sweeping government intervention. Anti-porn activists believed, for the first time, that they were actually winning.\n\n\u201cAnd then everything shifted, thanks to two factors,\u201d says Patrick Trueman, who led the DOJ\u2019s obscenity strike force. \u201cThe rise of the internet and Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nNobody disputes that obscenity prosecutions dropped off dramatically during the Clinton years\u2014as much as 70 percent, according to Reagan-era DOJ officials. And everyone agrees that the advent of the World Wide Web sparked pornography\u2019s historic propagation. The blame game boils down to the chicken or the egg: Did the explosion of internet porn make obscenity prosecutions pointless, or did the lax enforcement invite the explosion of internet porn? Whatever the answer, it\u2019s clear that the 1990s, a time of peace and prosperity and a whiff of libertinism, marked the start of this modern era of mass porn consumption.\n\nWith Meese and his anti-porn vice squad no longer running the DOJ, the industry itself grew more aggressive. \u201cNobody had gotten popped for a long time, so people were pushing and pushing and pushing. More gangbangs, more harder content, more teen-themed videos, and people felt pretty safe in doing just about anything they wanted to do,\u201d Max Hardcore, a former erotic film star and producer, told the Villanova Sports & Entertainment Law Journal in 2007, adding: \u201cClinton was good for the industry, good for the economy, and he didn\u2019t get us involved in any quagmire wars.\u201d\n\nSensitive to the perception of being soft on porn, the Clinton administration boasted of focusing its energy and resources on the narrower issue of child endangerment\u2014foreshadowing the approach taken by the opposition today. But even that low-hanging political fruit proved difficult to pick. The Communications Decency Act of 1996, which criminalized the distribution of offensive material to minors, was dismantled by the Supreme Court a year later. In response, a bipartisan group of legislators worked with the Clinton White House to craft the Child Online Protection Act, which focused more specifically on restricting minors\u2019 access to commercial material. But repeated court challenges led to a permanent injunction. The law never took effect.\n\nBy 2000, lawmakers settled on a lowest common denominator: mandating internet filters in public schools as a condition for federal funding. That law, the Children\u2019s Internet Protection Act, was upheld by the Supreme Court. It was evidence of success, however incrementally, for an anti-porn movement that felt the fight slipping away from them\u2014and that couldn\u2019t have known at the time how soon smartphones would render the legislation hopelessly antiquated.\n\nRepublicans hadn\u2019t yet given up on the political value of an anti-porn crusade. George W. Bush promised repeatedly during the 2000 presidential campaign to cast a wider prosecutorial net for obscenity. In practice, this would mean targeting the producers of hardcore material\u2014depicting, for example, rape, violence or bodily waste\u2014that satisfied the complex Miller test. Bush appeared to mean business when he selected as his attorney general John Ashcroft, a favorite of religious conservatives and a longtime anti-porn crusader himself. In his first eight months on the job, Ashcroft met with activists, organized a symposium, evaluated the department\u2019s operations and handpicked a new leader of the obscenity division. Combating pornography, Bush and Ashcroft told conservatives, would be a federal priority again.\n\nThat changed on September 11, 2001.\n\n\u201c9/11 stopped the Bush administration\u2019s momentum,\u201d says Richard Land, the longtime political head of the Southern Baptist Convention. \u201cThey were planning to re-Reaganize the Department of Justice on this issue, and then they got completely waylaid.\u201d\n\nClockwise from top left: Playboy magazine\u2019s inaugural issue, published in 1953; Playboy founder Hugh Hefner with Playboy Bunnies in London, 1966; Larry Flynt, founder and publisher of Hustler magazine; Rev. Jerry Falwell with GOP presidential candidate Ronald Reagan in 1980; Gloria Steinem participates in a march against pornography in New York, 1979. | AP; Getty\n\nNeil Malamuth, a University of California, Los Angeles, psychology professor and prominent scholar on porn, adds, \u201cBush was going to make pornography a major issue. But when 9/11 happened, his administration made a conscious decision that it wasn\u2019t worth it. They knew they didn\u2019t have the resources, and they knew they needed to rally the public around certain causes. Pornography wasn\u2019t one of them.\u201d\n\nTerrorism was suddenly an all-eclipsing concern for Americans across the ideological spectrum. As evangelical Christians grasped what this meant for their porn campaign, their concern turned to frustration and eventually anger. Religious conservatives watched in horror as big porn hitched itself to the rise of big tech, giving obscenity a foothold in corporate America and solidifying the adult industry\u2019s product as culturally tolerable. In December 2003, the magazine published by Christian organization Focus on the Family noted how, in 2000, \u201cconservatives celebrated what they thought marked the end of hard-core\u2019s unchecked reign.\u201d Three years later, the article concluded, \u201cthose celebrations have given way to disappointment.\u201d\n\nSuch criticism of Bush from the right faded, however, as his administration wore on. The simplest explanation is fatigue: Having lost so many battles during the Clinton years, only to then see the hope of the Ashcroft era vanish, much of the anti-porn movement ran out of gas. \u201cWe put the issue front and center in the \u201990s. Congress was engaged, we were engaged and the technology industry was engaged fighting against us,\u201d says Hughes, the internet safety advocate. \u201cWe had a bipartisan coalition behind us, but we were losing just about every battle in the courts. And it just demoralized so many people. I think that\u2019s when the white flag came out.\u201d\n\nAround this time, a pair of practical acknowledgments began reshaping the political discourse surrounding porn. The first was that Pandora\u2019s box could never be closed\u2014that with the internet oozing adult content from every portal, prevention and education made more sense than prosecution and enforcement. The second was that, to the extent prosecution and enforcement remained viable, the government\u2019s overriding responsibility should be protecting children\u2014from both viewing mature content and starring in it.\n\nThis is what animates much of today\u2019s anti-porn movement. Hughes considered it a \u201chuge victory\u201d when, in 2016, both Trump and Hillary Clinton supported her organization\u2019s Child\u2019s Internet Safety Presidential Pledge, which called for tougher enforcement of existing laws \u201cto prevent the sexual exploitation of children online.\u201d But the developments since have been discouraging. When Hughes raised the issue to Sessions at a meeting last year, he knew nothing about the pledge. Vice President Mike Pence told Hughes in a separate conversation that he supported her efforts\u2014but made clear that only Trump\u2019s active support could truly move the needle. She is not holding her breath.\n\nThe truth is, despite federal laws on the books\u2014as well as 25 state versions mandating filters in schools and libraries\u2014efforts to shield children from explicit content have failed miserably. In part, this is because of its sheer prevalence: The Huffington Post reported last year that porn websites account for more monthly traffic than Netflix, Amazon and Twitter combined. There has never been a reliable dollar figure placed on pornography as a whole; NBC News reported in 2015 that the industry is worth $97 billion, an estimate that experts I spoke with agreed was severely lowballing. Perhaps the most telling statistic: On planet Earth, only Google and Netflix are known to consume more bandwidth than MindGeek, the umbrella corporation that houses several of the biggest free porn aggregator websites.\n\nPrecise statistics related to adolescent pornography use are similarly elusive, in this case because kids worry about getting into trouble for answering honestly. In 2016, a Christian research organization called The Barna Group released the results of a comprehensive online survey based on interviews with nearly 2,800 participants. The findings were stark: Forty-nine percent of children ages 13 to 17 consume pornography at least once a month, with a further 30 percent saying they did so less often. Only 21 percent said they had never viewed pornography.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s been pushed to the side. It\u2019s been pushed off the table.\u201d\n\nThe numbers jumped considerably when moving to the next bracket, young adults ages 18 to 24. Among those respondents, 71 percent reported consuming pornography at least monthly, with just 9 percent saying they had never viewed it. These findings are consistent with the work done by academics; setting aside disagreements over morality and consequences, the consensus within the community of pornography experts is that young people are consuming explicit content in near-universal fashion. A study of the subject in 2009, undertaken by a researcher at the University of Montreal, had to be canceled. The reason: He could not find a control group of men in their 20s who had not viewed pornography.\n\nThe public\u2019s shifting attitude toward adult content is due in no small part to mass consumption by nonadults. In the survey, when respondents 25 and older were asked about the morality of watching porn, 54 percent said it was \u201cwrong.\u201d Yet among respondents ages 13 to 24, just 32 percent said viewing porn is \u201cwrong\u201d\u2014compared with 48 percent who said the same of overeating, and 56 percent who said the same of not recycling.\n\nYounger people are not the sole driver of porn\u2019s mainstreaming, however. At the beginning of the decade, Gallup began tracking the percentage of Americans who found porn \u201cmorally acceptable.\u201d The number was 30 percent in 2011. By 2018, it had spiked to 43 percent. Age aside, the sharp uptick can be heavily attributed to softer perceptions of porn among single men, nonreligious people and Democrats. Yet a greater acceptance of porn is apparent across virtually every demographic, including women, married men and churchgoers; among Republicans, the \u201cmorally acceptable\u201d figure has jumped 11 points in the past eight years.\n\nStill, 43 percent approval leaves a majority of Americans disapproving. In political terms, 57 percent represents a winning issue. There is no question most Americans feel that there\u2019s something wrong about porn; it\u2019s barred at workplaces and unwelcome in polite company. In polls its acceptability registers lower than other hot-button culture issues like abortion, gay marriage and legal pot. So why won\u2019t anyone in government go after it?\n\n\n\n***\n\nIn the dimly lit bowels of a Washington hotel complex, hundreds of politically active Christians gathered in late September for the annual Values Voter Summit. This year\u2019s exhibit hall offered advocacy for all seasons: expanded religious freedom, tighter abortion restrictions, counseling for relatives of ex-gays, paid family leave, single-gender college dormitories, refugee settlement programs, faith-based financial planning, the preservation of Social Security and much more.\n\nOne issue, however, was not represented: pornography. The closest thing to a mention of porn at the conference was in literature provided by the group Concerned Women for America, which combats \u201csexual exploitation.\u201d When I asked the two young women working the exhibit about specific advocacy related to porn, they shifted uncomfortably in their seats and produced a synchronized shrug. At a neighboring booth, Frank Mitchell, a Christian activist and veteran attendee of the summit, gave me his theory of the case. \u201cThe fact is, times have changed and we have bigger issues to deal with. If we\u2019re sitting around debating pornography, we\u2019re wasting our time,\u201d Mitchell says. He tells me the American Family Association was once the tip of the spear in combating obscenity; as fate would have it, he had just attended a lunch sponsored by that group. Did porn come up? \u201cIt didn\u2019t come up. It never comes up,\u201d Mitchell shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s been pushed to the side. It\u2019s been pushed off the table.\u201d\n\nTony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council and organizer of the Values Voter Summit, won\u2019t go that far. \u201cIt\u2019s still a very big issue, but it\u2019s not necessarily a policy issue because the internet has made it so that it\u2019s everywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, even before the internet, the government didn\u2019t do a good job of policing it. So how do you get the genie back in the bottle?\u201d\n\nIllustration by Alvaro Dominguez\n\nThis is the fundamental question facing an anti-porn movement that is attempting to rebrand itself. The adult industry\u2019s most notable modern adversary is Fight the New Drug, a well-heeled organization that grabbed headlines a few years ago by plastering \u201cPorn Kills Love\u201d billboards all over San Francisco. Hoping to transcend the stereotypes attached to the old opposition\u2014stuffy, Bible-thumping zealots\u2014Fight the New Drug markets itself as stylish and tech-savvy. The crucial distinction is emphasis: Rather than attacking porn as a moral evil in and of itself, Fight the New Drug focuses on the practical harms to people, relationships and families. That said, the wheel isn\u2019t being reinvented: The group calls itself \u201cnon-legislative and non-religious,\u201d but it publishes updates on political activities and was seeded with millions of dollars from Mormon church officials, a fact it downplays.\n\nMorality in Media, a faith-based organization that was central to anti-porn efforts beginning in the 1960s, was rechristened in 2015 as the National Center on Sexual Exploitation. Its president is none other than Trueman, the former DOJ \u201cobscenity strike force\u201d chief who says he is \u201ctrying to revitalize the movement against pornography\u201d to fit the times. \u201cWe knew it couldn\u2019t be and shouldn\u2019t be just a religious conservative issue, because pornography affects the issue of sex trafficking, it affects child sexual abuse, it affects sexual violence against women, it affects the rape crisis on college campuses,\u201d he says. \u201cWe needed to create a new movement, and we knew it needed to be broad-based in order to win.\u201d\n\nOne might think the #MeToo era, with its fierce backlash against toxic masculinity, would give new energy to the enemies of an industry that traffics heavily in the filmed subjugation of women. Some conservatives have tried to capitalize on this point; earlier this year, Ross Douthat wrote an op-ed in the New York Times titled, \u201cLet\u2019s Ban Porn.\u201d Feminists, however, are decidedly less vocal than they were in past decades, split internally over the question of whether filmed sex empowers women or exploits them. \u201cSome have broken with the faith-based organizations, but we haven\u2019t, even though we\u2019re a different breed\u2014progressive, lefty feminists,\u201d says Gail Dines, a prominent anti-porn activist. \u201cFor us, this is still all about gender equality. You can\u2019t pick and choose. You either believe that women and men have the right to the same political, social and cultural respect, or you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, inside the other half of the anti-porn coalition, it seems for every new step taken toward combating obscenity, two steps are taken back. Evangelical leaders I spoke with cited instances of pastors shying away from the subject for fear of alienating their congregants. \u201cIt\u2019s very pervasive even in the church,\u201d Perkins says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just men, it\u2019s women, too. \u2026 Some pastors are afraid to hit the issue too hard.\u201d\n\nIn this sense, it\u2019s easy to understand why elected officials have backed off. If politics is downstream from culture, and culture has accepted porn, why wouldn\u2019t politicians do the same? If pastors are afraid to alienate their constituents by condemning porn, what policymaker in his or her right mind would?\n\n\n\n***\n\nTodd Weiler went where no politician had gone before\u2014an unwitting trailblazer in the latest chapter of the war on porn. In March 2016, the Utah state senator created national buzz when he introduced a resolution labeling pornography \u201ca public health crisis.\u201d It passed unanimously in the Legislature and was signed into law by the governor. The resolution is toothless; it simply states that porn causes \u201ca broad spectrum of individual and public health impacts and societal harms,\u201d and calls for \u201ceducation, prevention, research and policy change at the community and societal level.\u201d Still, the action in Utah seemed to snap the debate surrounding porn from its yearslong slumber. Four other states\u2014South Dakota, Virginia, Tennessee and Arkansas\u2014passed similar resolutions in 2017. Florida and Kansas passed resolutions in 2018, and a host of other states have begun debating similar measures.\n\nTwo things stand out about Weiler\u2019s ploy.\n\nThe first is that Utah\u2019s resolution, which served as the template for those in other states, is filled with controversial, scientifically unverified suggestions about links to addiction, violence and infidelity. This was the product of a partnership with Trueman\u2019s group, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation. \u201cThey were looking for a \u2018courageous\u2019\u2014meaning dumb and gullible\u2014legislator to introduce the first resolution,\u201d Weiler says, laughing and recounting how he first stumbled into porn legislation because of dogged complaints from a constituent. The senator let Trueman\u2019s group draft much of the language; the result was criticism from outside experts for asserting causalities and correlations that have never been proven.\n\nIf pastors are afraid to alienate their constituents by condemning porn, what policymaker in his or her right mind would?\n\nThe second is that Weiler believes those debates are peripheral to the task at hand, having championed the resolution as a means toward a more specific end. He says American culture is past the point of no return when it comes to porn, and explains that he sponsored the measure for one reason\u2014to start a conversation about protecting minors. \u201cPeople think I\u2019m some kind of zealot,\u201d he says, \u201cbut everything I\u2019m doing is to protect children. I haven\u2019t sponsored any legislation dealing with adults. I\u2019m not trying to make pornography illegal. \u2026 People sell all kinds of things on the internet, but they don\u2019t sell them to 15-year-olds because they would get in trouble\u2014gun manufacturers, vaping companies, alcohol distributors. That\u2019s not the case with porn websites.\u201d\n\nIn this, at least, he has expert opinion on his side. The community of recognized authorities on pornography is small and secretive; most belong to a private listserv, \u201cSEXNET,\u201d hosted by Northwestern University. In conversations with a number of members, I heard diverging opinions about any number of issues\u2014but a consensus of near-panic emerged when I asked about the science of adolescent porn use and its physiological ramifications. Samuel Perry, a sociologist at the University of Oklahoma who has written more than 50 peer-reviewed articles and two books about pornography, says the debates regarding addiction and violence are \u201cideologically loaded, with some scholars bound and determined to find negative effects, and others bound and determined to say there\u2019s nothing to see here.\u201d When it comes to kids and porn, however, Perry says sociologists are generally and increasingly in agreement that we are facing a multifaceted crisis. Academics are unable to perform experiments that expose minors to explicit content, for obvious reasons, so they are left with third-party research that is often unreliable. Without their own data, academics have largely \u201cremained silent\u201d on the issue of adolescent porn consumption, at least publicly, Perry says, even as it\u2019s \u201ctremendously concerning for people across the spectrum, even the most sexually progressive people in my field, that young people are exposed to things they aren\u2019t ready for and don\u2019t know how to process.\u201d\n\nA possibility, given the meteoric growth of porn in America and the government\u2019s inability to contain it, is that human brains might be changed by processing obscenity at earlier ages. Malamuth, the UCLA professor and godfather of the porn research community, says he has taught a course on sexuality and women\u2019s studies for decades. His tradition was to show a disturbing, explicit clip as part of a lecture on pornography\u2014prefaced with a long warning about what the students were about to watch, and urging those with sensitivities to leave the room. \u201cWhen I first started showing it, you would have very strong reactions\u2014women crying, people hugging each other, deeply affected by it,\u201d Malamuth says. \u201cBut in the later years, after my warnings and after showing the film, the students would give me these strange looks. \u2018What the hell was the warning all about?\u2019\u201d\n\nMalamuth continues, \u201cThe anti-pornography people argued for years that once people saw enough of this stuff they would become desensitized in a way that\u2019s dysfunctional and could affect their attitudes and behaviors related to violence and women. The pro-pornography people said that once we\u2019re exposed to pornography we\u2019re desensitized in a good way\u2014we realize it\u2019s not a very big deal.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cThey\u2019ve looked at the same data and drawn different conclusions.\u201d\n\nThat debate will continue, no doubt, but it will take place on the outskirts of modern culture\u2014miles from the ideological mainstream and light years from the political arena. In this sense, desensitization isn\u2019t just an explanation; it\u2019s a national phenomenon. So much so that millions of elementary schoolers have instant access to unlimited amounts of pornography. So much so that lawmakers consider themselves powerless to do anything about it. So much so that news of the president of the United States having a past romance with a hardcore adult actress has met with a collective shrug. \u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d says Weiler, the Utah state senator. \u201cThe fact that the president cheated on his wife with a porn star has been kind of a yawner.\u201d\n\nTim Alberta is chief political correspondent for Politico Magazine.", "Harley Rouda, Democratic House candidate in California's 48th Congressional District, addresses supporters on Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Newport Beach, Calif. | Kyusung Gong/AP Photo Elections Rouda defeats Rohrabacher in Southern California\n\nDemocrat Harley Rouda on Saturday claimed victory in the race for California\u2019s 48th Congressional District, unseating 15-term incumbent Republican Rep.

The state has not elected a Democratic senator since 1988, but the campaign was hard-fought, attracting more than $50 million in outside spending from the two parties and outside groups. The acrimony has continued during the protracted vote count, with Republican officials in Washington urging McSally's campaign to suggest the count is somehow improper.\n\nArizona is one of two Senate races still uncalled after Election Day.
