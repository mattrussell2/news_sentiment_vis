["As Democrats across the country readied there 11th-hour midterm election push, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) was partying the night away with New York City\u2019s elite.\n\nSchumer joined Salman Rushdie, Tory Burch, Gay Talese, and Lally Weymouth, to celebrate the 2018 NYPL\u2019s Library Lions event at New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue. This year\u2019s honorees included Francis Ford Coppola, opera singer Jessye Norman, poet Claudia Rankine, and historian Ron Chernow.\n\nOrganizers of the annual event honoring patrons of the arts had sure to keep \u201cwine and cocktails continued flowing,\u201d according to Women\u2019s Wear Daily. Reporter Maxine Wally writes the interior design of the event was \u201ctruly a sight to see\u201d as \u201ccascades of vines\u201d draped the historical building\u2019s entrance.\n\n\u201cOn the third floor, the Rose Main Reading Room was transformed into a dining hall for the guests, where a live band played jazz tunes and the tables were festooned with alternating floral arrangements of orchids and white lilies. The whole night smacked of some bygone era of New York, when people wore fedoras and Mackintoshes and elbow-length gloves,\u201d per the magazine.\n\nUnlike leading Democrats, such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez, Schumer has struck a tempered tone about his party\u2019s prospects about retaking Congress. While he wouldn\u2019t express certainty about the Democrats retaking the Senate, Schumer did call the election \u201cneck and neck\u201d during an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe last month and said the Republicans\u2019 recent moves on health care were a \u201cgift.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me just say this. Mitch McConnell gave us a gift in the last three days. He showed who the Republican Party really is. Day one, cut Medicare, Medicaid, social security; day, two remove 30 million people from health care; day three, join a lawsuit that gets rid of pre-existing conditions,\u201d said Schumer. \u201cHealth care, you know my mother used to tell me when someone shows you who they are, believe them. That\u2019s a game changer. what McConnell did in the last three days is a game changer for us.\u201d", "The vice president of Iran on Tuesday claimed that sanctions imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump have failed to fulfill America\u2019s pledge to cut Tehran\u2019s crude oil exports down to zero.\n\nIran\u2019s state-run Press TV quotes Vice President Es\u2019haq Jahangiri as saying, \u201cThe Americans have constantly said they would bring Iran\u2019s oil sales to zero, but l have to say that we have been able to sell oil as much as we need up until today.\u201d\n\nThe VP\u2019s comments came a day after the U.S. unveiled a new slew of sanctions on Iran, marking a return to the policy of maximum pressure against Tehran suspended under the controversial nuclear agreement officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\n\nIn August, the Trump administration imposed the first round of sanctions suspended under the controversial Iran nuclear deal.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed that the Trump administration granted temporary sanction waivers to Iran\u2019s eight biggest customers \u2014 China, India, Italy, Greece, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Turkey \u2014 to ensure the move does not destabilize crude oil prices.\n\nReuters explains:\n\nThe original aim of the sanctions was to cut Iran\u2019s oil exports as much as possible \u2026 Crude exports contribute one-third of Iran\u2019s government revenues. The exemptions allow the eight countries to import at least some oil for another 180 days, and could mean the exports start to rise after November. This group of eight buyers takes as much as three-quarters of Iran\u2019s seaborne oil exports, trade data shows.\n\nCiting concerns about triggering global price hikes, Trump said he wanted to go easy on Iran sanctions.\n\n\u201cI could get the Iran oil down to zero immediately, but it would cause a shock to the market. I don\u2019t want to lift oil prices,\u201d President Trump told reporters.\n\n\u201cThe decision by the U.S. [to grant waivers] represents a departure, for now, from the stated aim of reducing Iran\u2019s oil exports to zero,\u201d Pat Thaker, regional director for the Middle East and Africa at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told Reuters.\n\nAccording to the Trump administration, the new sanctions target Tehran\u2019s oil, shipping, insurance, and financial sectors.\n\nVP Jahangiri argued that Iran could counter the U.S. sanctions, which he described as \u201cdomineering policies\u201d as well as \u201cillegal and immoral measures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Americans have entered the field of sanctions with all their power and capacity, but the important thing is that it [the U.S.] is standing isolated and alone on the world stage,\u201d he proclaimed.\n\n\u201cWe know no government in Europe, Africa, and Asia that officially voices support for U.S. sanctions; except the Zionist regime and a couple of regional countries,\u201d Jahangiri added.\n\nNon-U.S. signatories to the Iran nuclear deal have decided to remain committed to the agreement without the United States, which pulled out in May, noting that Tehran failed to meet its obligations under the pact.\n\n\u201cIran has vowed resistance in the face of Washington\u2019s economic pressure. It is now in talks with its other five partners in the deal \u2013 France, the UK, Germany, Russia, and China \u2013 to keep the international document alive and blunt the impact of the US bans,\u201d Press TV reports.\n\nOn Monday, Pompeo explained that the U.S. sanctions are intended to convince the Islamic Republic to \u201cabandon its current revolutionary course,\u201d adding:\n\nThe Iranian regime has a choice. It can either do a 180-degree turn from its outlaw course of action and act like a normal country, or it can see its economy crumble. We hope a new agreement with Iran is possible, but until Iran makes changes in the 12 ways that I listed in May, we will be relentless in exerting pressure on the regime \u2026 Rest assured Iran will never come close to getting a nuclear weapon on President Trump\u2019s watch.\n\nThe Trump administration has already imposed \u201c19 rounds of sanctions targeting 168 Iranian entities,\u201d Pompeo noted.", "Pop superstar Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles endorsed Texas Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke Tuesday just hours before polls close.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling grateful for everyone before me who fought so hard to give us all the right to have a voice,\u201d Beyonce wrote in an Instagram post.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t voice our frustrations and complain about what\u2019s wrong without voting and exercising our power to make it right. We need you. We all need each other, because when we are truly united we are unstoppable. Sending you all love and positivity on this happy voting day! Every vote counts Every race matters Everywhere,\u201d the Drunk in Love singer said.\n\nShe also posted other photos wearing a Beto O\u2019Rourke hat.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke responded to her post in a tweet, reading, \u201cThank you, Beyonc\u00e9!\u201d\n\nThis endorsement came literally hours before polls closed in Texas, where O\u2019Rourke is challenging incumbent Senator Ted Cruz.\n\nThe most recent RealClearPolitics average shows that Cruz is leading O\u2019Rourke in the polls by 6.8 points.\n\nThe Texas Democrat has been a strong supporter of many left-wing causes, defending the NFL kneelers in August.\n\n\u201cSo non-violently, peacefully, while the eyes of this country are watching these games, they take a knee to bring our attention and our focus to this problem to ensure that we fix it,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\n\u201cThat is why they are doing it. And I can think of nothing more American than to peacefully, standing up, or taking a knee, for your rights, anytime, anywhere, in any place.\u201d", "Welcome to the Breitbart News LiveWire of the 2018 midterm elections. Democrats need to pick up 23 seats to take back the House of Representatives and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who is looking to regain her Speakership, said earlier in the day that she is 100% certain that Democrats will win back the House. As David Axelrod said on CNN, Trump will either win the House tonight or retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) will lose it.\n\nDemocrats are less optimistic about taking back the Senate, especially after President Donald Trump barnstormed across the country in recent weeks to stump for key Republican Senate candidates. Odds favor Republicans maintaining control of the Senate and perhaps even gaining a few seats.\n\nAll eyes will also be on key gubernatorial races in states (Georgia, Florida, Ohio, Wisconsin) that will have huge 2020 ramifications.\n\nPrecincts across key states have seen record turnout while voting machines have malfunctioned from Georgia to Texas, forcing voters to stand hours in line to vote. Exit polling revealed that health care was the top issue for midterm voters while immigration was the most important issue for GOP voters.\n\nStay tuned throughout the evening for live updates of all of the important races.

As an independent force in the world, China needs to formulate its policies based on the facts. China doesn\u2019t want to confront any party and would like to play an active role in resolving disputes, protecting the truth and carrying forward international justice. In the meantime, China\u2019s interests should be respected. The deterioration of the Iranian situation has just begun. We hope that Washington will restrain its rash acts. These sanctions against Iran face many challenges as they lack legal basis and hurt too many countries. Washington will suffer if it underestimates the challenges.\n\nJosh Rogin at the Washington Post said on Tuesday that despite Beijing\u2019s complaints about renewed Iran sanctions, China is poised to profit from undermining President Trump\u2019s policy by \u201cplaying Washington and Tehran against each other and making a ton of money in the process.\u201d\n\nAs with the Global Times editorial, Rogin acknowledged there is evidence China is \u201cplaying ball\u201d with Trump by significantly reducing imports of Iranian oil, but in the long term China will end up enjoying cheap oil from Iranians eager to keep its business, while also benefiting from restrictions on how Iran can spend its oil money:\n\n\u201cChina has Iran over a barrel,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cU.S. sanctions mean Beijing can force Iran to give them discounts on Iranian oil they do buy while selling Chinese goods to Tehran at inflated prices paid from the restricted Iranian oil funds sitting in escrow accounts at Chinese banks.\u201d In many cases, these are Chinese goods that Iran doesn\u2019t even want, Dubowitz said. But because European companies are actually cutting off their oil business with Iran \u2014 and China is not \u2014 Iran is becoming more and more dependent on the Chinese market and therefore more vulnerable to Chinese tactics. \u201cSanctions work best when they encourage people to act in their own self-interest,\u201d said Dubowitz. \u201cThese sanctions empower Chinese traders to do what they do best: Squeeze those with less negotiating leverage.\u201d\n\nAnother opportunity for China could appear if the U.S. is able to lock Iran out of the SWIFT financial transaction system, which on Monday announced that several Iranian banks have been suspended from the service. This could inspire China to create an alternative to SWIFT, possibly working in concert with Russia, that would diminish the influence of the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on Tuesday looked at fluctuations in the oil market presently signaling confidence in global supply chains with surprisingly low prices, and speculated that some of the experts expecting the Iran sanctions to backfire are missing an important variable: rapidly growing American oil exports:\n\nIf global economic growth doesn\u2019t slow due to a trade war and if sanctions tighten considerably next spring, the first half of 2019 could see a significant rebound in prices. That might be short-lived, though, because U.S. output is expected to roar ahead by mid-2019. Iranian output fell by 1 million barrels a day from peak to trough under the previous nuclear sanctions.

What matters more to black voters? Goofball accusations from un-serious people or the lowest black unemployment in history?\n\nAs an American voter, I can tell you what matters more to me.

And Hispanic voters and Christians and Jews and Muslims and all the other categories Democrats like to divide Americans into.\n\nIf Mr. Trump can break down those false barriers and allow all voters to vote as Americans rather than the racial groups politicians put us all into then America will, indeed, be greater for it.\n\n\u2022 Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.", "Tuesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d former Bush and McCain campaign strategist Steve Schmidt said President Donald Trump ran a campaign that former Democratic Alabama Gov.

That makes the following numbers counter-intuitive, but this does not necessarily mean, as I will explain below, that there is a red wave crushing a blue wave.\n\nAs of November 5, the last day of early voting, a company called TargetSmart gives the GOP the edge in overall early voting.

I don\u2019t know if they have really studied the issue. I think that people have to be motivated, they have to be incentivized in order to produce more goods and services, or better goods and services. Products like an iPhone, for example, could never happen in a socialist country. I don\u2019t think these people know what the impact could be.\n\nROSS SORKIN: Thomas, what do you make of both the personal attacks \u2014 the bomb that was sent to his home, uh, he was also born in Hungary, he\u2019s also a billionaire, George Soros?\n\nPETERFFY: I don\u2019t think that people should do things like that. It\u2019s a terrible thing, I mean, you know, that person who should be put in jail or even worse \u2013 we should be civil to each other number one. Number two, we should have a debate instead of screaming and yelling at each other.\n\nROSS SORKIN: Why do you think given both of your backgrounds \u2014 how would you explain where you ended up in terms of how you think about the world, and where he ended up in perhaps how he thinks about the world?\n\nPETERFFY: George Soros is an enigma. He\u2019s a very bright man and I absolutely do not understand why he behaves the way he does. I think he\u2019s basically an anarchist. He was against communism in the 70s, and he\u2019s against free market capitalism today. So I don\u2019t know what is in between. So I don\u2019t understand it.\n\nROSS SORKIN: I\u2019m not so sure that a, he\u2019s an anarchist. I\u2019m not so sure that he doesn\u2019t believe in markets at all. I think that this might be an extreme version \u2014 the suggestion you\u2019re making. I\u2019d also make the argument that potentially, talk about socialism or socialism in Florida even, I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s what is really on offer, so much as it\u2019s about the pendulum swinging.\n\nPETERFFY: Yeah, well, look \u2014 I mean you go to any socialist country.. you can\u2019t find any country where socialism has been tried and where people are happy. It usually fails after some bloody interlude, it swings back to capitalism. Starting with the French revolution that has been through all throughout history. So ask yourself why is that? Why isn\u2019t there a socialist country today where people are happy?", "According to independent cybersecurity analysts and some officials from Pakistan\u2019s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), a large-scale hacking operation attacked the nation\u2019s banks beginning on October 27, reports revealed Tuesday.\n\nIn the most sensational accounts, the data breach was described as affecting \u201cmost\u201d or \u201calmost all\u201d Pakistani banks, enabling the theft of sensitive personal information such as debit card numbers. Pakistan\u2019s central bank pushed back against these reports on Tuesday and said the breach was much smaller than the most sensational claims, amounting to a credit-card scam that made off with only a few thousand dollars.\n\nThere clearly was a cyberattack of some sort in the last week of October, since a number of Pakistani banks announced the temporary suspension of international payment transactions, and the SBP (State Bank of Pakistan) central bank issued safety instructions on October 29. Pakistani media reports claimed some $6 million was stolen from an institution called BankIslami Pakistan.\n\nThe most alarming accounts of a truly massive data breach trace back to a Geo News quote from an FIA officer named Captain Mohammad Shoaib, sometimes described as the head of the agency\u2019s cyber-crimes unit, but Geo News also identified him as a retired official. Whatever his status, Shoaib asserted that \u201calmost all banks\u2019 data has been breached\u201d and \u201cmost of the banks have been affected\u201d by the hack.\n\nThis quote immediately produced some rather sensational headlines. Dawn.com, for example, began its piece by calling Shoaib\u2019s \u201calmost all banks\u201d comment a \u201cshocking revelation,\u201d but within a few paragraphs was talking about \u201chackers based outside Pakistan\u201d penetrating the security of \u201cseveral local banks\u201d to steal \u201clarge amounts of money.\u201d\n\nThere is quite a large difference between a raid on several banks and an attack that compromises the entire financial system of a nation. Shoaib\u2019s point appears to be not that hackers burned down the firewalls of Pakistani banking and compromised the entire system over the past week, but rather that many smaller cases have been quietly reported over the years by banks reluctant to warn their customers that cyber-theft is on the rise.\n\nGeo News followed up with an extensive report based on the work of a cybersecurity firm called Group-IB, which investigated the BankIslami caper and said even that was not a sudden, violent data breach. Instead, Group-IB said hackers stole a large number of credit and debit card numbers from various banks at some previous time and put 8,000 of them up for sale on a dark web forum on October 26, charging $100 to $135 for each stolen card number. A total of almost 20,000 card numbers appear to have been stolen and posted on dark websites.\n\nThe following day, BankIslami officials noticed a flurry of abnormally large transactions worth about $2.6 million and issued a press release, prompting the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s advisory to shut down international transactions until the situation could be sorted out. The fraudulent transactions do not themselves appear to be \u201chacking\u201d activity, but rather stolen card numbers employed at automatic teller machines and cash registers in several countries, including the United States.\n\nThe credit and debit card numbers do not appear to have been stolen through cyber-espionage. One bank official noted the thieves themselves described it as \u201cskimmed data\u201d \u2013 i.e. stolen using card readers surreptitiously installed in cash machines and point-of-sale devices \u2013 and said there is no indication the banks themselves were \u201cdigitally compromised.\u201d\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan noted the sensational news reports of a massive data breach with \u201cconcern\u201d and said it \u201ccategorically rejects such reports\u201d in a statement released on Tuesday.\n\nThe central bank also pointed out that some news reports indicated the amounts appropriated with stolen credit and debit cards using dollars, but most of the numbers actually referred to rupees, which are currently worth less than a penny. Pakistan\u2019s Computer Emergency Response Team estimated the total amount stolen so far was only about $20,000.", "Hollywood celebrities Lena Dunham, Sarah Jessica Parker, Ed Harris, and Henry Winkler are among some of HBO\u2019s biggest stars featured in an election day get-out-the-vote ad.\n\nThe video was released Tuesday by Rock the Vote, the self-described non-partisan group which aims to \u201cdedicated to building the political power of young people through pop culture, music, art, and technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just any Tuesday,\u201d Divorce actress Parker, donning a mint green blouse, says as she stares into the camera.

As governor, Phil Bredesen vetoed protections for concealed carry permit holders and opposed allowing law-abiding Tennesseans to carry a firearm for self-defense in the manner that best suits their needs.\n\nBredesen\u2019s gun control ties run so deep he left Tennessee in mid-October to attend a fundraiser hosted by gun control proponent Michael Bloomberg.\n\nThe only thing necessary to secure wins for Tester, McCaskill, and Bredesen is for gun owners and freedom lovers to put off voting on Tuesday. On the other hand, all three Democrats are beatable if NRA members and freedom lovers will simply vote like their gun rights depend on it\u2013because they do.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Unions were the enemy of innovation, an anchor to the status quo.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the issues that contributed to the walkout at Google \u2014 the company\u2019s controversial work with the Pentagon on artificial intelligence, its apparent willingness to build a censored search engine for China, and above all its handling of sexual harassment accusations against senior managers \u2014 proved too large for any one worker to confront alone, even if that worker made mid-six figures,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey required a form of solidarity that would be recognizable to the most militant 20th century labor organizers.\u201d\n\nLast week, Google employees staged mass walkout protests around the world following allegations that Google protected sexual harassers at the company.\n\nEmployees from New York City, Dublin, London, Singapore, Toronto, Berlin, Cambridge, and Mountain View in Silicon Valley all joined in with the protest and provided a list of demands to Google executives.\n\nAs previously reported, Google allegedly gave former executive Andy Rubin a \u201chero\u2019s farewell\u201d and a \u201c$90 million exit package,\u201d despite concluding that sexual harassment allegations against him were \u201ccredible.\u201d\n\nRubin has denied the allegations.", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZOi9aUFHc8&t=41m26s\n\nA partial transcript is as follows:\n\nREPORTER: You have a good political gut.

His execution was the first execution carried out in the state since 2007.\n\nTennessee law says that if inmates decide not to be put to death using the state\u2019s default method of lethal injection, they are required to choose an alternative method of execution.\n\nThe group settled on death by firing squad as the alternative method allowed under Tennessee law.\n\nOnly three states in the U.S.\u2014Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Utah\u2014allow for death by firing squad, although attorneys for the men say Tennessee has the resources to carry out firing squad executions.\n\n\u201cThere exists one or more feasible and readily-available alternative methods of execution which substantially reduce the constitutionally-unacceptable risk of inflicting unnecessary and serious pain created by the use of electrocution to carry out Plaintiffs\u2019 executions,\u201d Stephen Kissinger, a federal public defender representing the inmates, wrote in the lawsuit.\n\nIf the court declines their request, the lawsuit requests permission for the inmates to choose alternative execution methods, such as swallowing lethal drugs or using different drugs than the ones provided via lethal injection.\n\nA spokesperson for Tennessee\u2019s Department of Correction declined to comment, citing the pending lawsuit.", "China rejected calls on Tuesday from Western members of the U.N. Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to shut down the massive detention camps constructed in Xinjiang province to imprison a sizable percentage of Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group.\n\nThe Chinese claimed that reports of the vast scale of detentions in Xinjiang are \u201cseriously far away from facts,\u201d even as a new study revealed security spending in the province more than tripled during the past year.\n\nOn Tuesday, Reuters relayed some of the criticism directed at China during a meeting of the UNHRC in Geneva:\n\n\u201cWe are alarmed by the government of China\u2019s worsening crackdown on Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslims in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region,\u201d U.S. charge d\u2019affaires Mark Cassayre said. The United States urged China to \u201cabolish all forms of arbitrary detention, including internment camps in Xinjiang, and immediately release the hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of individuals detained in these camps,\u201d he said. China should release activists including Wang Quanzhang, Ilham Tohti and Huang Qi, Cassayre said. Beijing should \u201chalt massive imprisonment\u201d and \u201cguarantee freedom of religion and belief, including in Tibet and Xinjiang,\u201d French Ambassador Francois Rivasseau said.\n\nGay McDougall, a member of the U.N.\u2019s Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, said Xinjiang province has become \u201csomething resembling a massive internment camp, shrouded in secrecy, a sort of no-rights zone.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and U.K. had some tough questions for China, as reported by Channel News Asia:\n\nOne question by the US \u2013 which is leading demands for Beijing to come clean on the crackdown \u2013 says: \u201cCan China clarify the basis for its apparent criminalization of peaceful religious practices as justification to detain people in these political \u2018re-education\u2019 camps in Xinjiang, as well as which officials are responsible for this policy?\u201d Washington also wants Beijing to provide \u201cthe number of people involuntarily held in all detention facilities in Xinjiang during the past five years.\u201d Britain has asked when China will implement a UN racial discrimination panel\u2019s recommendation that it \u201chalt the practice of detaining individuals who have not been lawfully charged, tried, and convicted for a criminal offence in any extralegal detention facilities.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s representative to the UNHRC, Tamara Mawhinney, denounced the \u201cdeterioration of human rights\u201d in China and called on Beijing to \u201cend prosecution and persecution on the basis of religion or belief.\u201d\n\nAs Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail noted while passing along Mawhinney\u2019s words, China\u2019s admirers, satellite states, clients, and fellow travelers in authoritarianism drowned out the criticism with \u201ca chorus of flattery for Beijing\u201d:\n\nBangladesh marveled at \u201cthe development miracle of China.\u201d North Korea commended Beijing \u201cfor its strenuous efforts and brilliant success made for the promotion and protection of human rights.\u201d South Africa called China \u201da global leader on people-centered development and poverty eradication, as well as a formidable defender of multilateralism.\u201d \u201cWe particularly congratulate China on its economic and social achievements, which are extraordinary,\u201d added a delegate from Burundi, who recommended \u201cthat China continue to focus on terrorist organizations\u201d like the East Turkestan Islamic Movement.\n\nChina\u2019s representatives to the UNHRC rejected all criticism out of hand, accused Western nations of downplaying \u201cthe remarkable achievements made by China,\u201d and defended its suppression of free speech and political dissent in jurisdictions from Xinjiang to Hong Kong by arguing that \u201cfreedom is not absolute.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not accept the politically driven accusations from a few countries that are fraught with biases, with total disregard for facts. No country shall dictate the definition of democracy and human rights,\u201d snarled Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng, effectively dismissing human rights concerns as a racket that jealous Western nations organized to keep Beijing in check.\n\nSeveral member states urged China to allow U.N. observers into Xinjiang to inspect the camps. After initially denying their existence and downplaying their size, the Chinese began describing them as \u201cvocational training centers\u201d and \u201cde-radicalization\u201d clinics. China has, thus far, dismissed requests for U.N. monitors in the Uighur camps as a violation of its sovereignty.\n\nA report that the Jamestown Foundation published on Monday analyzed Chinese government budgets and determined that security spending in Xinjiang increased by 213 percent. The authors said this money clearly was not spent on \u201cvocational training,\u201d as quoted by Reuters:\n\n\u201cXinjiang\u2019s budget figures do not reflect increased spending on vocational education \u2026 as the region ramped up camp construction; nor do they reflect an increase in criminal cases handled by courts and prosecutors,\u201d said the report\u2019s author, Adrian Zenz, an anthropologist at the European School of Culture and Theology in Germany. \u201cRather, they reflect patterns of spending consistent with the construction and operation of highly secure political re-education camps designed to imprison hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs with minimal due process.\u201d It also found that despite the purported large \u201cvocational training\u201d campaign, employment outcomes had not markedly improved, according to Xinjiang\u2019s own official employment figures. Whatever training the facilities do provide, Zenz said, it appeared it was not administered or paid for by the vocational education system.\n\nAsked about the Jamestown Foundation report on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying professed ignorance of how much money her government spends in Xinjiang province and asked if the Jamestown research properly accounted for how much Beijing spends on \u201cdeveloping the economy and improving lives.\u201d", "With so many Americans streaming in to voting booths today to cast their vote on the future direction of the country, there\u2019s one prominent American political/sports figure who \u2014 if he still believes what he said two years ago \u2014 definitely will not.\n\nThat particular figure is Colin Kaepernick.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, ESPN Business Reporter Darren Rovell tweeted a 2016 quote from Kaepernick.

Nor do they allow people to protest. Two crucial factors that \u2014 one would think \u2014 might disabuse Kaepernick of the notion that he\u2019s living in an oppressive state.\n\nBut also, if Kaepernick doesn\u2019t plan to vote, because he thinks such a thing would be hypocritical, then how exactly does he plan to overthrow the \u201coppressors?\u201d Voting is civilized man\u2019s peaceable response to the torch and the pitchfork, or the bomb and gun. If the former 49er refuses to partake in the process of peaceful change, then what method of change is he in favor of?\n\nAnd why would anyone take Colin Kaepernick seriously \u2014 as a political figure \u2014 when he refuses to participate in the only peaceful means we have of influencing the political process?\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "TEL AVIV \u2013 Russia on Monday accused Israel of putting its military in danger by violating a tacit agreement to give advanced warning before conducting airstrikes in Syria, prompting Moscow to respond in a \u201cfirm but contained manner.\u201d\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov\u2019s rebuke comes as the two countries are suffering a fraying of ties following an Israeli strike on September 17 that resulted in Syrian forces downing a Russian plane, killing 15 Russian crew members. Russia at the time accused Israel of using the spy plane as cover, a claim Israel denies.\n\nAlthough Israel and Russia have generally coordinated their respective military actions in Syria, Jerusalem has made it clear that it does not need Moscow\u2019s approval before carrying out strikes there.\n\nNevertheless, Lavrov blasted Israel for not upholding its commitment.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the Israeli side did not always strictly comply with its obligations, especially as regards the obligation to notify the Russian military about combat operations in Syrian territory,\u201d he told the Spanish-language El Pais in an interview published Monday.\n\nHe added that IAF strikes in Syria in recent years have put military personnel in danger.\n\n\u201cOn several occasions this endangered the lives of our military in Syria; for example, in the Israeli aerial bombardment in the region of Palmyra in March 2017,\u201d added Lavrov, referencing the raid on the T-4 air base near Palmyra in central Syria, which Israel said housed an Iranian drone program.\n\nIsrael has asked Moscow to help prevent further military entrenchment in Syria by Iran and its proxy, Lebanese terror group Hezbollah. Lavrov told El Pais that Israel\u2019s actions in Syria would not help in attaining this goal.\n\n\u201cWe warned in all ways and at the highest level [to the Israelis] that such an attitude could lead to tragic consequences. At the same time, we emphasize that acts of force contribute to increasing regional tension and cannot solve the security problems that concern Israelis,\u201d said Lavrov.\n\n\u201cHowever, [the Israelis] continued to bomb targets in Syrian territory and that was what led to the tragic demolition of the Russian reconnaissance aircraft Il-20 with 15 officers on board.

DeSantis is running on a conservative platform of across-the-board lower taxes, an end to judicial activism, protection of patients with pre-existing conditions, and strong border policies, including opposition to sanctuary cities and implementation of the E-verify system.\n\nDeSantis served in Iraq for the U.S. Navy and received a Bronze Star Medal for Meritorious Service and the Iraq Campaign Medal before becoming the Congressman for Florida\u2019s Sixth District.\n\nGillum started his activism immediately after college by landing a job with the radical, George Soros-financed People for the American Way, or PFAW. He served there first as field organizer in 2002 and then as Director of Youth Leadership Programs from 2005 until January 13, 2017. He departed PFAW just ahead of his gubernatorial run.\n\nIn his position of youth leadership director at PFAW, Gillum was in charge of both Young People For, or YP4, the organization\u2019s youth training program, and the organization\u2019s Young Elected Officials (YEO) Network, which he founded and which describes itself as \u201cthe first national program singularly-focused on providing a network of support to young progressive state and local elected officials.\u201d\n\nYP4\u2019s mission was to challenge U.S. \u201cpredatory capitalism,\u201d abolish the prison system, fight a \u201cspiritual resistance\u201d battle against \u201cChristian hegemony,\u201d redefine the meaning of \u201cborders\u201d while aiding \u201cundocumented\u201d aliens, and enact the \u201ccollective liberation\u201d of \u201ccommunities of color\u201d amid what it described as the scourge of \u201cwhite supremacy.\u201d\n\nGillum\u2019s group accused the U.S. of being a \u201ccolonialist\u201d power perpetrating \u201cstructural violence\u201d and \u201ccontinued genocide.\u201d It claimed conservatives in the U.S. judicial system were \u201cjustifying white supremacist policing practices.\u201d\n\nAll of that extremist rhetoric and more was posted on the official \u201cissues\u201d sections of the organization\u2019s website while Gillum not only served as its active director, but while his picture, position and bio were brandished on the same site on the \u201cstaff\u201d page.\n\nA Breitbart News investigation found that even while he was a Tallahassee city commissioner and later the city\u2019s mayor, Gillum was heavily involved in the controversial YP4 youth leadership program as youth director, announcing multiple hires and headlining fundraising and group events.\n\nDuring the current gubernatorial race, Gillum has faced controversy over his abject refusal to disavow Dream Defenders, an anti-patriotic, anti-capitalism, anti-military, anti-police organization that has engaged in activist efforts to promote the boycott of Israel and with which Gillum has been associated. DeSantis has repeatedly called for Gillum to distance himself from Dream Defenders.\n\nNow it has emerged that Philip Agnew, the co-founder of Dream Defenders, is a 2005 graduate of Gillum\u2019s former YP4 group.\n\nAlso, at a January 17, 2014 YP4 summit, Gillum\u2019s YP4 gave Agnew the Norman Lear Award, named after the producer and activist who founded People for the American Way.\n\nDuring a debate last month, Gillum claimed that he had \u201cno idea\u201d what DeSantis was referring to when he brought up a Dream Defenders pledge Gillum reportedly signed that supports a \u201cradical manifesto.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact is, Andrew signed a pledge with the Dream Defenders pledging his support, this radical manifesto,\u201d DeSantis said at the televised debate.\n\n\u201cI have no idea what pledge he is talking about,\u201d Gillum replied.\n\nGillum\u2019s claim of ignorance about the pledge came despite his already known close relationship with Dream Defenders. Gillum has talked about aiding the group\u2019s activism and has written in strong support of Dream Defenders and its co-founder, Agnew. In turn, Agnew himself recently described a long and close working and personal relationship with Gillum and said he considers Gillum to be \u201cpart of the movement.\u201d\n\nGillum was taped at a June debate saying that he is \u201cpleased and proud\u201d to have sneaked food to Dream Defenders activists during a 30-day sleep-in protest at the Florida State Capital, referring to a 2013 month-long anti-gun protest in the wake of the Trayvon Martin shooting. \u201cI hope you keep at it,\u201d Gillum said of Dream Defenders activists during a June event.\n\nIn June 2018, Gillum signed a Dream Defenders pledge containing specific language stating, \u201cI pledge my support to the Freedom Papers.\u201d The organization\u2019s \u201cFreedom Papers,\u201d in turn, exclaim that \u201cpolice and prisons have no place in \u2018justice.\u2019\u201d\n\nDeSantis, meanwhile, has been focusing on growing Florida\u2019s economy. DeSantis said he will capitalize on Florida\u2019s attractive positon following Trump\u2019s change in state and local tax (SALT) deductions. He pledged to further \u201cdo what we can in terms of eliminating some dumb taxes in Florida, like a business rent tax. I would like to reduce our business tax generally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe greater imbalance we can have between a low tax Florida and high tax in these other areas that is going to recruit more and more investment into Florida.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Breitbart News, DeSantis continued: \u201cAnd I think we are looking at a mass migration potentially of financial services into places like Palm Beach and Miami. I think you\u2019re going to see more technology developed in Florida if we keep the climate good and do some of the things I am talking about. And then even manufacturing because I think it would be attractive to expand the manufacturing footprint here.\u201d\n\nDeSantis warned that if Gillum is victorious then Florida will \u201cbecome a petri dish for people like George Soros and Tom Steyer,\u201d referring to the activist billionaires.\n\nDays before Gillum\u2019s Aug. 28 primary, Soros joined with fellow billionaire Steyer to lead a group of donors making a $650,000 infusion into Gillum\u2019s coffers.\n\nSoros contributed to The Collective, a little-known but increasingly influential political organization that says it is seeking to build a \u201cblack political power\u201d movement. The Collective reportedly injected nearly $2 million into Gillum\u2019s campaign, funding television and radio ads and get-out-the-vote drives.\n\nGillum recently disclosed a New York hotel invoice made out to Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations for the same weekend the politician was in the city and obtained a ticket to see the popular \u201cHamilton\u201d Broadway show in a fiasco involving a corruption probe of the city of Tallahassee, where he serves as mayor, and undercover FBI agents.\n\nBreitbart News reported that Gillum graduated from an Oakland, California-based training school for progressive revolutionaries that has spawned a list of activists who have gone on to become the who\u2019s who of the far-left leadership world, with many taking senior positions at organizations financed by Soros.\n\nIn scores of cases, graduates of the Rockwood Leadership Institute founded or directed notorious Soros-financed activist groups, such as Black Lives Matter, Media Matters for America, MoveOn.org and the Tides Foundation, one of the nation\u2019s largest funders of progressive groups.\n\nSoros\u2019s own Open Society Foundations sent top staff to Rockwood for training. Notorious radicals Van Jones and Linda Sarsour are among the many famous names listed as alums.\n\nGillum is listed as a 2012 Rockwood alum. The Florida politician\u2019s involvement with the radical school was not cursory or symbolic.

During this election, Gillum signed the Dream Defender pledge, ostensibly to refuse money from the NRA and from corrections contractor the GEO Group.\n\nHe claimed in a debate last week that he had \u201cno idea\u201d about the pledge, showing either complete ignorance or dishonesty. As Breitbart News has documented, Gillum gave a \u201cshout out\u201d to the Dream Defenders and praised them for \u201cshaking up the political system\u201d and even gave them an award for their \u201coutstanding commitment to social justice and the progressive movement\u201d\n\nGillum\u2019s Republican opponent, Ron DeSantis, has focused on the Dream Defenders\u2019 support for boycotting, divesting, and sanctioning Israel. In fact, Dream Defenders\u2019 co-director Phillip Agnew even referred to Israel as \u201ccold, calculating racism and ethnic privilege masquerading as a Jewish State.\u201d Gillum responded that his opponents are unfairly using guilt by association and trying to take \u201cevery position by that group and put it on Andrew\u2019s back and make him carry it.\u201d\n\nRegardless, the DREAM Defenders\u2019 pledge itself is evidence of far left radicalism. By signing this pledge, Gillum announces that he agrees with the hard left\u2019s anti-gun, open borders agenda. His pledge to the far left group is consistent with his record.\n\nDream Defenders\u2019 opposition to the GEO Group is not only based on the fact that they are a \u201cprivate prison,\u201d but largely because they contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for illegal immigrant detention.\n\nKnowing that Americans want their immigration laws enforced, the leftists focus their ire on companies, a softer target, which hold the majority of ICE detention capacity currently for the government. Dream Defenders\u2019 Organizing Director recently admitted that the group\u2019s ultimate objective is to Abolish ICE, stating \u201cWe know that if we can actually defund GEO\u2026we can actually abolish ICE. So we\u2019re in the position to win right now. We just have to keep taking action.\u201d\n\nThis so-called \u201caction\u201d even includes the spread fake news to achieve their goal. One of the worst smears the group has spread is that GEO Group runs \u201cspecial prison bus for babies\u201d for ICE. Naturally, the left-wing group saw this \u201cevidence\u201d as another example for why ICE should be abolished.\n\nHowever, the truth is quite different from what Dream Defenders peddles. According to the Weekly Standard Fact Check, GEO Group on behalf of ICE, operates the buses to take young children staying at family detention facilities with their mothers on field trips, not for deporting toddlers to their native country. \u201cEach seat has a convertible child safety seat and is equipped with a DVD system with four drop down screens to provide entertainment to the children with onboard movies during transport missions,\u201d an internal report on the buses states.\n\nThe buses also come with no bars or steel cages. These are hardly the terrifying prisons buses Dream Defenders make them out to be. Instead, the buses demonstrate that the operators of immigrant detention are committed to providing a humane service to those illegally in the United States.\n\nJust like Dream Defenders targets the NRA in an effort to undermine the Second Amendment, they are targeting contractors to undermine our immigration laws in an effort to abolish ICE. Andrew Gillum is fully on board with this agenda, and has called for the \u201cabolishment of ICE in its current form.\u201d This position is far out of the mainstream \u2014 polls show only 25 percent of Americans support abolishing ICE.\n\nSaul Alinsky instructed Radicals to \u201cPick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it. Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy.\u201d This is exactly what Gillum and the DREAM Defenders are trying to do by attacking companies and associations instead of actually defending their highly unpopular and radical positions.", "London police have launched their fifth murder investigation in a week, after a 16-year-old boy died in a suspected stabbing, and extra officers were taken off leave and deployed to the streets.\n\nPolice were called to \u201creports of a shooting\u201d in Tulse Hill, south London, on Monday night with the youth pronounced dead just before midnight.

Today, the site is one of the best-preserved landscapes and archeological sites associated with United States Colored Troops recruitment and the refugee experiences of African American slaves seeking freedom during the Civil War.\u201d\n\nThe Civil War recruitment and training camp \u201cwas organized around an 800-acre core, included more than 300 buildings and tents that housed a quartermaster commissary depot, ordnance depot, recruitment center, prison, and a hospital,\u201d the proclamation says.\n\n\u201cCamp Nelson reminds us of the courage and determination possessed by formerly enslaved African Americans as they fought for their freedom,\u201d the proclamation continued. \u201cThe broader Camp Nelson archeological record also provides opportunities for research and scholarship related to military history, race, identity, and gender during the Civil War \u2014 a pivotal chapter of the Nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nMore than 10,000 African American soldiers enlisted at and were trained at Camp Nelson during the war and added to the 23,000 Kentucky blacks who fought for the Union Army and the 179,000 total black troops who served during the war.\n\nThe inclusion of blacks into the U.S. war effort was hailed as the biggest step toward certifying that they would be considered U.S. citizens from that point forward.\n\nFamed anti-slavery advocate Frederick Douglass celebrated the black soldier saying, \u201cOnce let the black man get upon his person the brass letter, U.S., let him get an eagle on his button, and a musket on his shoulder and bullets in his pocket, there is no power on earth that can deny that he has earned the right to citizenship.\u201d\n\nWhile Kentucky was a slave state as the war started and initially tried to stay neutral as the fighting flared, the state eventually became a federal stronghold. Indeed, despite its southern leanings, more Kentucky men served in the Union Army than served in southern forces. About 125,000 Kentuckians fought for the north during the war while only about 33,000 went into the thin gray ranks.\n\nForty-thousand African Americans died nation-wide during their service between 1862 and 1865.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "Attorneys for Grammy Award-winning singer Rihanna fired off a cease-and-desist letter to President Donald Trump after her music was reportedly played during a rally held by the Commander-in-Chief over the weekend.\n\n\u201cIt has come to our attention that President Trump has utilized [Rihanna\u2019s] musical compositions and master recordings, including her hit track \u2018Don\u2019t Stop the Music,\u2019 in connection with a number of political events held across the United States,\u201d the letter sent to the White House general counsel reads, according to Rolling Stone. \u201cAs you are or should be aware, Ms. Fenty has not provided her consent to Mr. Trump to use her music.

That would make the 2018 midterms over a third higher than the $3.8 billion for the 2014 midterms, and more than triple the $1.6 billion in 1998.\n\nExecutive Director for the Center for Responsive Politics Sheila Krumholz commented: \u201cThe significance of this election is clear. But whether it\u2019s a blue wave or a red wave, one thing is certain: A wave of money is surging toward Election Day, much of it coming from the wealthiest donors targeting this year\u2019s most competitive races.\u201d\n\nOver the prior five congressional midterms, Republicans spent slightly more than Democrats in each cycle. But 2018 Democrat congressional candidates are projected to spend more than $2.53 billion, versus about $2.20 billion for Republican candidates.\n\nOpenSecrets reveals that Democrat spending was most dominant in 435 U.S. House of Representative contests where Democratic hopefuls raised over $951 million, versus just $637 million for Republican contenders.\n\nThe funding difference in the 35 U.S. Senate contests for 2018 is narrower, with Democrats spending $513 million to just $361 million for Republicans.\n\nOpenSecrets focused on 27 U.S. House races where, despite being rated \u201cLikely Republican\u201d by the Cook Political Report, GOP candidates just barely outraised their Democrat opponents by $2 million to about $1.95 million.\n\nFor the 29 Republican House seats that were rated \u201ctoss-ups\u201d by the Cook Political Report, Democratic candidates crushed GOP opponents by raising an average of $5.5 million to just $3 million.\n\nDemocrats outraised Republicans in every quarter in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections. In the last FEC filing for the October 1 through 17 pre-election period, Democrats raised $126 million to the Republicans\u2019 $82.5 million.\n\nResearch Director at the Center for Responsive Politics stated that FEC data revealed that women and small donors fueled the Democratic 2018 midterm fundraising.\n\nWomen donated $308 million to Democrats, versus just $90 million to Republicans.

From Keith Ellison to Maxine Waters, Democratic leaders have turned to radicals like Saul Alinsky and Jeremiah Wright for direction and inspiration without regret or apology.\n\nOn Election Day eve, I woke up to the chilling news that Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, a notorious antisemite who was once welcomed to Washington by then-Sen. Barack Obama, led a \u201cDeath to America\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel\u201d chant while on a solidarity trip to Iran. According to Fox News, \u201cFarrakhan\u2019s trip came ahead of the Trump administration\u2019s re-implementation of U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic on Monday\u201d.\n\nWhile Farrakhan\u2019s bigotry is well known, it is truly alarming that the mainstream media has little interest in reporting on this egregious offense. As pointed out in a tweet by a true patriot and friend of the Jewish people, Donald Trump Jr., \u201cWhen will the [D]emocrats disavow this guy?\u201d He followed his question by stating the obvious: \u201cNEVER\u201d.\n\nWhen will the democrats disavow this guy? Answer: NEVER https://t.co/zlDO5KMsMy \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 5, 2018\n\nIt is true, with \u201cthe (not so) quiet radicalization of the Democratic Party,\u201d the Democratic National Committee and its affiliates have charted a course wherein antisemitism is not only acceptable but, at times, encouraged. Take the Women\u2019s March, for example, which is billed as the backbone of the new Democratic Party \u2013 one that is more \u201cinclusive\u201d and \u201cprogressive.\u201d That is, of course, unless you\u2019re Jewish.\n\nLinda Sarsour, one of the group\u2019s leaders, has been able to use the Women\u2019s March as a platform to mainstream \u201cjihad\u201d and the dehumanization of Israelis into progressive politics. And Sarsour isn\u2019t the only culprit. Women\u2019s March co-conspirator Tamika Mallory has also expressed her undying fandom of Farrakhan in the past, and has reportedly refused to condemn his bigoted comments as well.\n\nSadly, this is only a small sample of countless reports that indicate a rising antisemitism within the so-called progressive community. As pointed out on CNN this past Tuesday by former White House official Marc Short, the press continues to ignore antisemitic comments by Minnesota Democrat and congressional candidate, Ilhan Omar.\n\n\u201cIn Minnesota\u2019s 5th district, there\u2019s a congressional Democrat who\u2019s running an anti-Semitic campaign,\u201d said Short. \u201cShe has all sorts of anti-Semitic language in her past and she\u2019s going to be the nominee [sic]. How much has CNN covered that? Do you even know her name? Do you even know who she is?\u201d\n\nProgressive big business has largely overlooked the Democrats\u2019 antisemitism. Ice cream makers Ben & Jerry\u2019s recently introduced a new anti-Trump ice cream flavor, partnering up with none other than Linda Sarsour and the Women\u2019s March. Pro-Israel advocates and Jews across the globe rightfully expressed dismay and frustration at this outrageous act. The new flavor even forced a the Israeli affiliate of Ben & Jerry\u2019s to issue a public statement distancing itself from the policy of its parent company, according to The Tower.\n\nSo, where does this leave us?\n\nSimply put, we have a Democratic Party that has grown comfortable mainstreaming antisemitism and palling around with Jew-haters. Are voters willing to remain silent or complicit while the Jewish people remain under fire? What will we tell our children when they ask us what we did to stop a party that mainstreamed the concept of Jewish persecution?\n\nThe answer is crystal clear: vote red to save America. And vote red to save the Jewish community in America.\n\nRabbi Yechezkel Moskowitz is director of the Moskowitz Policy Forum and special assistant to Cherna Moskowitz.", "Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol agents arrested a member of the transnational criminal gang known as Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) on Friday.

of war crimes by the Islamic State group, the UN said Tuesday.\n\nThe United Nations in Iraq (UNAMI) and its human rights office said they had documented a total of 202 mass graves in parts of western and northern Iraq held by IS between 2014 and 2017.\n\nEven more sites could be uncovered in the months to come, the report warned, urging Iraqi authorities to properly preserve and excavate them to

keep territory in the country\u2019s north and west.\n\nThe mass graves may \u201ccontain critical forensic material\u201d that could help uncover the details of these violations, as well as identify

militants.\n\n\u2013 Infamous sinkhole \u2013\n\nOut of the 202 mass graves documented in the UN\u2019s new report, just 28 of them have been excavated and 1,258 bodies exhumed by Iraqi authorities.\n\nNearly half the total sites are in Nineveh province, where IS\u2019s onetime Iraqi capital Mosul lies and where the jihadists committed mass atrocities against the Yezidi minority.\n\nAccording to Iraq\u2019s high commission on human rights, more than 3,000 Yezidis remain missing in Nineveh, in addition to another 4,000 people.\n\nThe rest of the sites are distributed in the northern regions of Kirkuk and Salaheddin, or Anbar in the west.\n\nSome of those that have yet to be excavated are secured by Iraqi armed forces, but others remain endangered by fighting or are contaminated by explosive devices left behind by IS.\n\nThe largest, according to the report, is expected to be the Khasfa sinkhole south of Mosul, where as many as 4,000 people may have been killed.\n\nIS has planted explosives at Khasfa, which killed a journalist and three members of Iraqi paramilitary forces last year.\n\nAfter capturing Mosul, Iraqi government forces went on to oust IS

an accessory to murder for crimes committed during the years he served as a guard at the Nazis\u2019 Stutthof concentration camp.\n\nJohann Rehbogen is accused of working as a guard at the camp east of Danzig, which is today the Polish city of Gdansk, from June 1942 to about the beginning of September 1944.\n\nThere is no evidence linking him to a specific crime, but more than 60,000 people were killed at Stutthof and prosecutors argue that as a guard, he was an accessory to at least hundreds of those deaths.\n\nStutthof prisoners were killed in a gas chamber, with deadly injections of gasoline or phenol directly to their hearts or shot, starved and even forced outside in winter without clothes until they died of exposure, prosecutor Andreas Brendel said.\n\nThe former SS Sturmmann, roughly equivalent to the U.S. Army rank of specialist, does not deny serving in the camp during the war but has told investigators he was not aware of the killings and did not participate in them, Brendel said.\n\nRehbogen\u2019s attorney, Andreas Tinkl, has said his client will make a statement in the trial at the Muenster state court, which is scheduled to last until January, but it was not immediately clear when he would speak.\n\nRehbogen lives in the western municipality of Borken near the Dutch border. In deference to his age and health, the trial is being restricted to a maximum of two hours a day, with no more than two non-consecutive days a week. At the same time, because he was under 21 at the time of his alleged crimes, he is being tried in juvenile court.\n\nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center, which helped locate some 20 Stutthof survivors for the case to serve as possible witnesses, emphasized that such trials are important, even more than 70 years after the end of World War II.\n\n\u201cThe passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of Holocaust perpetrators and old age should not afford protection to those who committed such heinous crimes,\u201d said the center\u2019s head Nazi hunter, Efraim Zuroff.\n\nMany survivors, along with relatives of victims, are also joining the trial as co-plaintiffs as allowed under German law.\n\nEven though the number of suspects is dwindling, the special federal prosecutor\u2019s office in Ludwigsburg that investigates Nazi war crimes still has multiple cases ongoing. In addition to looking at camps like Stutthof, Buchenwald, Ravensbrueck, Mauthausen and Flossenbuerg, it is also investigating former members of the mobile killing squads known as the \u201cEinsatzgruppen.\u201d\n\nThe legal reasoning that being a camp guard is itself enough to be found guilty of accessory to murder, even without specific evidence of a crime, was first used successfully against former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk in 2011.\n\nDemjanjuk was convicted in Munich on allegations he served as a Sobibor death camp guard. He always denied the accusation and died before his appeal could be heard.\n\nThe 2015 conviction of former Auschwitz guard Oskar Groening using the same argument, however, was upheld by Germany\u2019s top criminal court on appeal, cementing the precedent.\n\nThe Stutthof case is the first time a prosecution is going to trial using this line of reasoning for a concentration camp guard instead of a death camp guard. But prosecutors have expressed confidence it can be applied, since tens of thousands of people were killed in Stutthof even though its sole purpose was not murder.\n\nStutthof was established in 1939 and underwent several iterations, initially being used as the main collection point for Jews and non-Jewish Poles removed from the nearby city of Danzig on the Baltic Sea coast.\n\nFrom about 1940 onward, it was used as a so-called \u201cwork education camp\u201d where forced laborers, primarily Polish and Soviet citizens who had run afoul of their Nazi oppressors, were sent to serve sentences and often died. Others incarcerated there included criminals, political prisoners, homosexuals and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\n\nFrom mid-1944, it was filled with tens of thousands of Jews from ghettos being cleared by the Nazis in the Baltics as well as from Auschwitz, which was overflowing, and thousands of Polish civilians swept up in the brutal suppression of the Warsaw uprising.", "Legislation clearing the way for Israeli courts to sentence convicted Palestinian terrorists to death will be debated by lawmakers next week, Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Tuesday while vowing to have it passed.\n\nLiberman and his Yisrael Beytenu party have long advocated introducing the death penalty for terrorists and the issue was one of the party\u2019s key campaign promises in the 2015 elections.\n\n\u201cAfter over three years of a stubborn struggle, the death penalty for terrorists law will finally be brought to the law committee next Wednesday (November 14), and then for its first reading in the Knesset plenum,\u201d Lieberman said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t relent or stop until completing the mission.\u201d\n\nA preliminary vote by the full parliament passed the initial bill in January. As it stands, it would ease the requirements military courts in the West Bank must meet to sentence Palestinians convicted of terrorists to death.\n\nThe new capital punishment bill would change the requirement to a majority instead of unanimity. Israel last carried out an execution in 1962 when Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann was hanged.\n\nSupport for consideration of the new law has public backing.\n\nAs Breitbart Jerusalem reported, last year some 70 percent of Israelis favored giving the death penalty to Palestinian terrorists who murdered Israelis, according to the monthly Peace Index released by the Israel Democracy Institute and Tel Aviv University.\n\nThe poll found that 69.8 percent of Israelis would support giving death sentences after a trial to Palestinians who murdered Israeli citizens for nationalistic reasons. The percentage saying they would oppose the death penalty was 25.3 percent, and 4.9 percent said they did not know or declined to respond.\n\nThe current bill was flagged in 2017 when MK Robert Ilatov said the legislation is necessary to deter future terrorists from carrying out attacks. \u201cThe legislation needs to be clear and unequivocal. A terrorist who comes with the goal of murdering innocent citizens \u2014 his sentence is death,\u201d said Ilatov in a statement.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously expressed support for the death penalty in certain cases.", "The Times of Israel reports: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday laid the foundation stone for the kingdom\u2019s first nuclear research reactor, state media said, as the kingdom seeks to diversify its energy mix.\n\nThe reactor was among seven projects launched by the prince during a visit to Riyadh\u2019s King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.

This means that not only Wilders but also Twitter is subject to punishment in those countries. The world is bigger than the Netherlands,\u201d Mr K\u00f6se said.\n\nThe lawyer pointed to specific tweets by the anti-Islamisation advocate, such as, \u201cThe truth: Mohammed is the example for more than 1 billion Muslims. Mohammed was a paedophile, mass murderer, terrorist, and madman,\u201d saying that the tweet \u201churt\u201d Muslims and \u201clegitimises violence\u201d.\n\nThe leader of the Party for Freedom (PVV), the second largest party in the Netherlands but which has been frozen out of the governing coalition by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte after the March 2017 parliamentary elections, tweeted AD\u2018s article with the single word in incredulity: \u201cMadness.\u201d\n\nIn March the TICF filed a complaint with the Netherlands\u2019 public prosecutor\u2019s office against Wilders in relation to a movie he shared on Twitter which stated that Islam equals discrimination, violence, and terror.\n\nThe Public Prosecutor decided not to bring a case against Wilders, with K\u00f6se commenting that his client \u201cfound that incomprehensible. We, therefore, started looking for other ways to stop Wilders. If it does not work through criminal law, we\u2019ll try through civil law.\u201d\n\nIn late 2016, Mr Wilders was found guilty of inciting discrimination and fined 5,000 euros for comments he made about Moroccan migrants in a trial the Dutch politician called a politically motivated \u201ccharade\u201d that endangered freedom of speech. And in 2011, he was also acquitted of incitement after he compared the Muslim holy book the Quran to Adolf Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf.\n\nFreedom to criticise Islam made headlines in October after the European Court of Human Rights upheld an Austrian court\u2019s conviction of a woman who referred to Islam\u2019s prophet, Mohammed, as a paedophile \u2014 Austria having laws against disparaging religious doctrines \u2014 a ruling criticised as \u201ca blasphemy law by the back door\u201d by UKIP leader Gerard Batten.", "Police in the heavily migrant-populated Swedish city of Malm\u00f6 say the two shootings and two separate explosions over the weekend are directly linked to rival gangs.\n\nA total of four incidents and an arrest occurred over the course of the weekend in various parts of the city which has been rocked by gang violence, Swedish broadcaster SVT reports.\n\nThe first incident occurred on Friday night in the notorious no-go suburb of Roseng\u00e5rd in which an unknown attacker shot at an apartment in the area.\n\nThe shooting is just the latest in the area which also saw an explosion outside the local police station in January, which led to several police vehicles and the facade of the building being damaged.\n\nAlso on Friday evening, an explosion occurred outside of a driving school that was so powerful the apartments above the school were partially damaged by the blast according to investigators, although no one was injured.\n\n2018 Malmo Sweden Fatal Shootings Surge, Already Set to Beat 2017 Figure https://t.co/NfXk0nz0Kc \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 20, 2018\n\nOn Saturday night, another shooting attempt occurred in Roseng\u00e5rd when an individual shot at a local townhouse with what is believed to have been a shotgun.

According to investigators, the target was a property that contained a hair stylist among other businesses.\n\nThe explosion badly damaged the facade of the building, forcing officers to cordon off the area for several hours.\n\nPolice then arrested a 21-year-old on charges of extortion at around 1:40am Monday morning who they believe may have some connection to the attacks.\n\nThe weekend of violence comes after the city experienced a mass shooting earlier this year which saw three men shot dead outside of an internet cafe in June. It was later revealed that nearly all of the victims of the shooting were known to be involved in the organised crime scene.", "The day he was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh made history as the first justice to hire an all-female staff of law clerks. This was in keeping with his record of hiring more women than men and of sending more women to clerk on the Supreme Court than any other judge in the country during his 12-year tenure on the federal bench.\n\nThe women who clerked for him \u2013 including those who identify as liberals\u2014describe him as \u201ca lifelong mentor who feels an enduring responsibility for each of his clerks,\u201d \u201can extraordinarily thoughtful man, who goes out of his way to be kind\u201d and whose \u201chiring and support of women alone has helped to really diversify the range of Supreme Court clerks.\u201d\n\nSo how did a man who is a proven ally of women, who is universally praised by female colleagues and has never had any complaints lodged against him over his decades-long career, come to be labeled a \u201crapist\u201d and those who voted to confirm him to the Supreme Court as \u201crape enablers\u201d?\n\nIt took a mix of political activism, uncorroborated allegations, and left-wing hysteria \u2013 all woven seamlessly into a media narrative blasted 24/7 to drown out the truth and transform a good man into a monster.\n\n\u201cThe left does not win its battles in debate. It doesn\u2019t have to. In the twenty-first century, media is everything. The left wins because it controls the narrative. The narrative is controlled by the media. The left is the media. Narrative is everything,\u201d Andrew Breitbart wrote in his memoir, Righteous Indignation.\n\nHe called this the Democrat-Media Complex. It\u2019s what turned Brett Kavanaugh into a \u201crapist.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t take my word for it. Let\u2019s review the evidence.\n\nOn Saturday, the Senate Judiciary Committee released a 414-page report of its investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations lodged against Kavanaugh during his confirmation process. The report explained\u2014in painstaking detail\u2014that neither the committee\u2019s investigation nor the FBI\u2019s background investigation could find \u201cany evidence to substantiate or corroborate any of the allegations.\u201d\n\nOpposing the Nomination of \u201cXX\u201d\n\nFrom the moment President Trump named Kavanaugh to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, the left rallied to oppose him at all costs. It wasn\u2019t personal. It was about abortion. They opposed him\u2014just as they oppose every Republican judicial nominee\u2014because they feared he might someday vote to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nOn the evening July 9, after Trump announced Kavanaugh\u2019s name, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) vowed to oppose his nomination \u201cwith everything I have.\u201d\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) announced her opposition by calling Kavanaugh \u201ca fundamental threat to the promise of equality\u201d whose nomination would be the \u201cdestruction of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh will threaten the lives of millions of Americans for decades to come,\u201d former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe tweeted.\n\nOf course, the left would have opposed anyone Trump nominated regardless of his or her actual record. As if to prove this point, the Women\u2019s March organizers released a statement condemning \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s nomination of XX to the Supreme Court.\u201d They forgot to include Kavanaugh\u2019s name in their ready-made denunciation of him.\n\nThey weren\u2019t the only activists who came prepared. Outside the Supreme Court that night, left-wing protesters waved pre-printed \u201cStop Kavanaugh\u201d signs as they listened to one senator after another rile them into a frenzy by denouncing Kavanaugh as an \u201cextremist\u201d who would turn back the clock on women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cThis is a nominee who wants to pave the path to tyranny,\u201d Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) told the crowd.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) said, \u201cStopping [Kavanaugh] will take all of us, fighting as hard as we can, raising our voices again and again.\u201d\n\nThe crowd that night was already in fighting form. Fox News\u2019 Shannon Bream tweeted, \u201cVery few times I\u2019ve felt threatened while out in the field. The mood here tonight is very volatile. Law enforcement appears to be closing down 1st Street in front of SCOTUS.\u201d\n\nBut in the weeks and months that followed, Kavanaugh\u2019s genial temperament and even-handed judicial record defied the left\u2019s attempts to \u201cBork\u201d him. But that didn\u2019t stop them from trying.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) called Kavanaugh \u201cyour worst nightmare,\u201d and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) declared at a July 24 press conference that Democrats \u201care walking through the valley of the shadow of death\u201d with this nomination.\n\n\u201cYou are either complicit in the evil, you are either contributing to the wrong, or you are fighting against it,\u201d Booker said.\n\nRhetoric aside, the Democrats and their media allies lacked a scandal to shape their anti-Kavanaugh narrative. Their early efforts were rather pathetic. The Washington Post\u2019s first attempt at scandal-mongering made Kavanaugh look good rather than bad. The Post reported that Kavanaugh paid off $60,000 to $200,000 in credit card debt he amassed due to home improvements and from purchasing Washington Nationals season tickets for himself and his friends.\n\nThat last detail caught the eye of the left-wing journalists at ProPublica who solicited the public\u2019s help in uncovering the identity of Kavanaugh\u2019s baseball buddies. \u201cDid you attend a Washington Nationals game in 2017? You might be able to help us. Really,\u201d ProPublica tweeted. They wanted to know: \u201cWho did Kavanaugh buy tickets for? How did they reimburse him? Was this properly disclosed? And how was all of this treated for tax purposes?\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, this line of scandal speculation didn\u2019t yield much.\n\nThough the Democrats did their best to whip up anti-Kavanaugh hysteria, their constitutional avenues to stopping his nomination were all but closed. They simply did not have the votes to block him. So they turned to the strategy of obstruction and delay \u2013 with the hope of demoralizing the GOP by delaying the confirmation vote until after the midterms, which, depending on the election outcome, could doom his nomination forever.\n\nDelay, Delay, Delay\n\nKavanaugh had a massive paper trail from his decades in government \u2013 from his time working for Special Counsel Ken Starr\u2019s Clinton investigation, to his tenure as George W. Bush\u2019s staff secretary, to his years on the federal bench. The Democrats demanded to see it all. The Republicans largely obliged.\n\nSenators were given a record-breaking 900,000 pages of documents on Kavanaugh. (For the sake of comparison, for the two most recent justices, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch, senators received 172,000 and 184,000 pages of documents respectively.) Kavanaugh also completed the most comprehensive questionnaire in the history of the Senate Judiciary Committee, totaling 110 pages and accompanied by 17,000 pages of supporting documentation.\n\nThe Democrats next play was to claim: We don\u2019t have enough time to read all of this! When that didn\u2019t work to delay the confirmation hearings, they tried: But this can\u2019t be all of it!\n\nThe Judiciary Committee held hearings from September 4-7, 2018. Aside from shrieking left-wing protesters being dragged out and Sen. \u201cSpartacus\u201d Booker\u2019s botched attempt to break Senate rules, the hearings went as expected. Kavanaugh was articulate, polite, knowledgeable, and likeable.\n\nIn fact, the hearings were so anti-climactic that left-wing Slate ran an article titled \u201cThe Grotesque Decency of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Confirmation Hearings.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the hearings, Kavanaugh was on schedule to be confirmed in time for the Supreme Court\u2019s new session on Oct. 1.\n\nFeinstein\u2019s \u201cBrett Kavanaugh-Related Document\u201d\n\nOn September 13, the Intercept reported that \u201cDemocrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have privately requested to view a Brett Kavanaugh-related document in possession of the panel\u2019s top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, but the senior California senator has so far refused, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation.\u201d\n\nLater that day, Feinstein finally issued a statement confirming the existence of the letter but declining to offer any details out of respect for the letter writer\u2019s request for confidentiality. However, Feinstein\u2019s motives soon came into question. Rather than submit the letter to the Senate Judiciary chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), so that its allegations could be investigated confidentially, Feinstein sat on the letter. She never mentioned the allegations during her closed-door meeting with Kavanaugh or during his 32 hours of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee spanning three days.\n\nThe contents of the letter leaked to the media the day after Feinstein informed her Democrat colleagues about it. No Republican was aware of the letter. Therefore, it goes without saying that a Democrat senator or their staffer leaked the letter to the press.\n\nThe \u201cCredible\u201d Dr. Ford\n\nA media firestorm followed, until finally the letter\u2019s author, a psychology professor from Palo Alto, CA, named Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, went on the record with the Washington Post to describe the alleged incident in her own words. She claimed that Brett Kavanaugh attempted to sexually assault her at a party 35 years ago when they were both teenagers and he was \u201cstumbling drunk\u201d at the time.\n\nFord\u2019s account to the Post also made clear that she was uncertain about key details, such as the exact date of the event, the location, and how she got to the party and home from it. She also revealed that she told no one about the incident until 2012, when she and her husband were in couples therapy. That year, Kavanaugh\u2019s name was in the news because he was included in a short list of potential Supreme Court nominees for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.\n\nThe notes Ford\u2019s therapist\u2019s wrote, which the Post claimed to have seen in part, contained glaring discrepancies about the incident. The therapist wrote that four boys were involved in the alleged assault, but Ford claimed that only two were: Kavanaugh and his friend, Mark Judge. The therapist\u2019s notes also do not contain Kavanaugh\u2019s name. Ford blamed the discrepancies on the therapist\u2019s transcription. During her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ford would claim that she could not recall whether she even gave the Post reporters her therapist\u2019s notes.\n\nIn late July, on the advice of Senator Feinstein\u2019s staff, Ford had secured the legal representation of Debra Katz, a lawyer with a long history in Democratic politics who specializes in sexual harassment cases and had publicly defended Bill Clinton and Al Franken from accusations of sexual misconduct. After first refusing the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s requests to interview their client, Katz and her associates engaged in a weeks-long back and forth with Sen. Grassley\u2019s staff as the Republicans sought to accommodate Ford\u2019s quirky requests in exchange for her testimony. Grassley\u2019s staff even offered to travel to California and interview Ford in the privacy of her own home.\n\n\u201cWhen her attorneys finally responded, [Ford\u2019s attorneys] insisted on a Thursday, September 27 hearing date,\u201d according to the Senate Judiciary report. \u201cDr. Ford\u2019s attorneys refused to agree to earlier dates. The Committee was informed that Dr. Ford had a fear of flying caused by Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s alleged sexual assault on her more than 35 years before.\u201d\n\nDespite the media\u2019s insistence that Ford was a \u201ccredible\u201d witness, her testimony had major holes and contradictions, which were carefully exposed during a series of questions from veteran prosecutor Rachel Mitchell. As Mitchell\u2019s report to the Committee made clear, Ford\u2019s allegations would not hold up in a court of law. \u201cIn the legal context, here is my bottom line,\u201d Mitchell wrote. \u201cA \u2018he said, she said\u2019 case is incredibly difficult to prove. But this case is even weaker than that. I do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence.\u201d\n\nMitchell noted, for example, that Ford kept changing the date of when the alleged incident happened\u2014from the \u201cmid-80s\u201d to the \u201cearly 80s,\u201d from when she was in her \u201clate teens\u201d to when she was in her \u201cearly teens.\u201d Which was it? And why did she cross out the word \u201cearly\u201d in \u201cearly 80s\u201d in the statement she swore to for her polygraph report?\n\nFord testified that the \u201cprimary impact [of the alleged assault when she was 15 years old] was in the initial four years after the event.\u201d She specifically claimed that she struggled academically in college, but didn\u2019t mention anything about her last two years in high school. A former college classmate of Ford\u2019s issued a statement to the Judiciary Committee attesting that Ford had a \u201cvery robust and active social life,\u201d which \u201ccontradicts Dr. Ford\u2019s narrative that she had a difficult time making friends due to the alleged sexual assault.\u201d This same classmate also contradicted Ford\u2019s claim that she had a phobia of small places.\n\nOne of the more dramatic moments in the hearing was when Ford, under questioning from Mitchell, calmly debunked her own alleged fear of flying:\n\nMITCHELL: May I ask, Dr. Ford, how did you get to Washington? FORD: In an airplane. MITCHELL: OK. It\u2019s \u2014 I ask that, because it\u2019s been reported by the press that you would not submit to an interview with the committee because of your fear of flying. Is \u2014 is that true? FORD: Well, I was willing \u2014 I was hoping that they would come to me, but then I realized that was an unrealistic request. MITCHELL: It would\u2019ve been a quicker trip for me. FORD: Yes. So that was certainly what I was hoping, was to avoid having to get on an airplane, but I eventually was able to get up the gumption with the help of some friends, and get on the plane. MITCHELL: OK. When you were here in the mid \u2014 mid-Atlantic area back in August, end of July, August, how did you get here? FORD: Also by airplane. I come here once a year during the summer to visit my family. MITCHELL: OK. FORD: I\u2019m sorry, not here. I go to Delaware. MITCHELL: OK. In fact, you fly fairly frequently for your hobbies and your \u2014 you\u2019ve had to fly for your work. Is that true? FORD: Correct, unfortunately. MITCHELL: You \u2014 you were a consulting biostatistician in Sydney, Australia. Is that right? FORD: I\u2019ve never been to Australia, but the company that I worked for is based in Australia, and they have an office in San Francisco, California. MITCHELL: OK. FORD: I \u2014 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll make it to Australia. MITCHELL: It is long. I also saw on your C.V. that you list the following interests of surf travel, and you, in parentheses, list \u201cHawaii, Costa Rica, South Pacific islands and French Polynesia.\u201d Have you been to all those places? FORD: Correct. MITCHELL: By airplane? FORD: Yes. MITCHELL: And your interests also include oceanography, Hawaiian and Tahitian culture. Did you travel by air as a part of those interests? FORD: Correct. MITCHELL: All right. Thank you very much. FORD: Easier for me to travel going that direction when it\u2019s a vacation.\n\nWritten testimony from one of Ford\u2019s former boyfriends of many years also debunked her alleged fear of flying. He noted that she often flew on planes\u2014even a small propeller plane\u2014and had no discernible fear of small spaces or of rooms with one door, as she claimed. In fact, the former boyfriend pointed out that Ford lived for a number of years in a tiny apartment with only one entrance.\n\nHis testimony also suggested that Ford may have perjured herself when she claimed that she had never \u201cgiven tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test.\u201d He claimed that Ford coached her roommate, Monica McLean, on how to be less nervous in case she had to take a polygraph exam when she interviewed for jobs with the FBI and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nMitchell\u2019s questioning also exposed the holes in Ford\u2019s story concerning basic facts about where the alleged incident occurred and how she got there and back home. Mitchell\u2019s report noted:\n\n\u201c[Ford] told the Washington Post that the party took place \u2026 more than 7 miles from her childhood home \u2026 that it was a roughly 20-minute drive from her childhood home.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe also agreed for the first time in her testimony that she was driven somewhere that night, either to the party or from the party or both.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she has no memory of who drove her or when. Nor has anyone come forward to identify him or herself as the driver.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven that this all took place before cell phones, arranging a ride home would not have been easy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, she stated that she ran out of the house after coming downstairs and did not state that she made a phone call from the house before she did, or\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026that she called anyone else thereafter.\u201d\n\n\u201cDr. Ford testified that her friend Leland, apparently the only other girl at the party, did not follow up with Dr. Ford after the party to ask why she had suddenly disappeared.\u201d\n\nFord also had memory lapses concerning recent events. She could not, for example, remember whether the polygraph test she took less than two months prior happened on the day of her grandmother\u2019s funeral or the day after her grandmother\u2019s funeral. She also couldn\u2019t remember if the polygraph test was audio or video recorded. She could not remember whether she gave the Washington Post her therapist\u2019s notes.\n\nAnd finally there was the fact that none of the other witnesses named by Ford could corroborate her story: not Kavanaugh; not Mark Judge; not Patrick \u201cPJ\u201d Smyth; and not even Leland Keyser, Ford\u2019s lifelong friend who was the only other girl allegedly at the party. In two separate statements, Keyser\u2019s attorney stated on her behalf that she had never met Kavanaugh, did not know him, and \u201chas no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.\u201d\n\nAs Mitchell notes, \u201cDr. Ford testified that her friend Leland, apparently the only other girl at the party, did not follow up with Dr. Ford after the party to ask why she had suddenly disappeared.\u201d That is odd behavior for a girl friend, who would almost certainly ask why Ford left her behind to find her own way home.\n\nThe Floodgates Open\n\nFord\u2019s allegation was not credible, but she was at least the most credible of the other ludicrous accusers who came forward after her to lodge allegations at Kavanaugh. Those allegations have been debunked so thoroughly that the Senate Judiciary Committee has referred four of these accusers to the Justice Department for potential criminal prosecution for issuing false testimony to Congress. This includes the debunked allegations submitted by Democrat lawyer Michael Avenatti on behalf of his client Julie Swetnick. This also includes the recanted allegations submitted by a Democrat activist from Kentucky who claimed that Kavanaugh raped her when she was in high school, despite the fact that she is decades older than Kavanaugh. And this also includes the recanted allegations of a Rhode Island man who claimed that Kavanaugh and Mark Judge raped a woman on a boat in 1985.\n\nThere was also the allegations made by Deborah Ramirez, a Democratic activist who was a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s, who claimed that Kavanaugh \u201cexposed himself at a drunken dormitory party, thrust his penis in her face, and caused her to touch it without her consent as she pushed him away.\u201d\n\nBreitbart\u2019s John Nolte summarized the seven key details of Ramirez\u2019s allegation:\n\nJust before she fingered Kavanaugh, Ramirez was telling classmates she could not be certain it was Kavanaugh. Ramirez admits her drinking that night clouded her memory. Only after six days of talking to her attorney, a Democrat politician, was Ramirez able to remember it was Kavanaugh. Every single one of Ramirez\u2019s so-called witnesses sides with Kavanaugh. The only so-called corroboration Ramirez had was a guy who heard about the incident from someone else. That someone else says he has no memory of the incident. Ramirez is a Democrat activist.\n\nInterestingly, the Senate Judiciary Committee report includes a statement from a Yale classmate who graduated a year after Kavanaugh and Ramirez and testified that another of their classmates who also belonged to the same fraternity as Kavanaugh had \u201ca reputation for exposing himself publicly.\u201d In fact, this witness even provided the Committee with a yearbook photo showing this individual exposing himself in it.

They lionized the accusers. Left-wing outlets like the HuffPost even hyped nonsense stories about a law student who was told\u2014by a female professor\u2014to dress professionally when applying for a clerk position with then-Judge Kavanaugh. The way the HuffPost made it sound, Kavanaugh was demanding his female clerks look \u201ca certain way.\u201d In fact, the story amounted to little more than a female professor helpfully informing a young law student that Kavanaugh likes his staff to dress professionally.\n\nThe media rang the bell, burying Kavanaugh\u2019s good name under a mountain of innuendo. Let\u2019s see if any of them even attempt to un-ring that bell now that these allegations have fallen apart. I\u2019m not holding my breath. This is, after all, the same media that hid information that cleared Kavanaugh of one allegation and buried information that debunked their own story.\n\nKavanaugh\u2019s name will be forever tarnished in the eyes of those who think he is a \u201crapist.\u201d Ford, on the other hand, has been feted by progressives as a new heroine. She has reportedly raked in a million dollar windfall and received several book deals. She has also been publicly honored by the Palo Alto City Council; and a professor at her alma mater, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has nominated Ford for a distinguished alumna award for \u201cspeaking truth to power.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s report notes that the Committee\u2019s investigators \u201ccontinue to pursue several issues related to the allegations against Justice Kavanaugh.\u201d Considering what a thorough job the Democrat-Media Complex did in smearing Kavanaugh, the Committee could be investigating for years.", "There are 172 military veterans running for office in this midterm election from both parties \u2014 a total of 109 Republicans, 62 Democrats, and one independent, with 67 of them incumbents, according to the Military Times.\n\nHere are five of the top Republican veterans we are watching:\n\n1.

She was also the first female commander of an Air Force fighter squadron. She was an A-10 pilot, the aircraft popular among troops for its support of ground troops in combat.\n\nMcSally flew combat patrols over Iraq, to enforce the U.S. no-fly-zone, and over Afghanistan, dispatching weapons from her A-10 for the first time in combat.\n\nMcSally also sued the Pentagon and got it to change its policy requiring American servicewomen stationed in Saudi Arabia to wear an abaya, or full-length cover, when traveling off base.\n\nMcSally is the first female Republican representative from Arizona. She also has pipes, recently singing the national anthem at an Arizona State University football game:\n\nThrilled and honored to be able to sing the National Anthem before \u2066@ASU\u2069\u2019s homecoming game.

Dan Crenshaw: Retired Navy SEAL and Wounded Warrior\n\nDan Crenshaw is a retired Navy SEAL lieutenant commander running for the House of Representatives in Texas\u2019s 2nd Congressional District.\n\nCrenshaw is a 6th generation Texan who is fluent in Spanish. He joined the SEALs after graduating in 2006 from Tufts University, where he did Navy ROTC.\n\nHe served five deployments overseas, his first in Fallujah, Iraq. On his third deployment in 2012, he was hit by a roadside bomb during a mission in southern Afghanistan. His right eye was destroyed in the blast, and his left eye badly damaged. Completely blind, after several difficult surgeries, he regained sight in his left eye.\n\nCrenshaw would go on to deploy two more times, one in the Middle East and then in South Korea. After he medically retired in 2016, he completed a Master\u2019s degree at the Harvard Kennedy School of government.\n\nHe recently made headlines after Saturday Night Live performer Pete Davidson mocked him for wearing an eye patch, saying he looked like a \u201chit man in a porno movie.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know he lost his eye in war or whatever,\u201d Davidson added, to laughter from the audience.\n\nCrenshaw fired back in a tweet, \u201cGood rule in life: I try hard not to offend; I try harder not to be offended.

Scott Perry: The Brigadier General Who Pulled Himself Up By His Bootstraps\n\nScott Perry, 56, is an Army National Guard Brigadier General who is running for the House of Representatives in Pennsylvania\u2019s 4th Congressional District. He is a three-term incumbent and previously served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.\n\nGrowing up in Pennsylvania, Perry\u2019s home often had no running water or electricity. He began working at age 13, first as a fruit picker, then a draftsman, dockworker, and insurance agent. He graduated from Pennsylvania State University and would later earn a Master\u2019s degree from the United States Army War College.\n\nHe served in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2009 through 2010 as the commander of the 2nd Battalion, 104th Aviation Regiment. He flew 44 missions and accrued nearly 200 combat flight hours.\n\nHe was promoted to brigadier general in November 2015 and assigned as assistant adjutant general for Army at the Pennsylvania National Guard\u2019s Joint Force Headquarters in May 2016.", "WASHINGTON, DC \u2013 U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco petitioned the Supreme Court on Monday to immediately review the legality of the Trump administration\u2019s ending the DACA amnesty program, bypassing the Ninth Circuit appeals court and ending the six-year legal saga by next summer.\n\nFormer Secretary Janet Napolitano created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) for more than 400,000 illegal aliens in 2012, which the Obama administration in 2014 expanded to a larger amnesty, DAPA, covering over one million additional illegal aliens.\n\nTexas and various other states challenged DAPA as illegal. The federal district and later the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed, striking down the amnesty program. The Supreme Court then tied 4-4 on the case after the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia, leaving the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment against DAPA in place.\n\nAfter President Donald Trump took office, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a legal analysis explaining that DACA is illegal for the same reasons the courts found DAPA illegal. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) adopted Sessions\u2019 legal analysis and started winding down DACA.\n\nVarious organizations filed lawsuits nationwide, arguing that even though the prior administration created DACA with the stroke of a pen, that federal lawsuit prohibited the current administration from ending it by a similar process. The legal challengers filed suit in three left-leaning federal district courts, winning judgments in all three, beginning in 2017. All three of those cases are currently pending on appeal in different federal circuit courts.\n\nFrancisco had asked the Supreme Court to skip the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to immediately review the first of those cases, a case filed in California, filing a \u201cpetition for certiorari before judgment\u201d under Supreme Court Rule 11.\n\nHowever, in February 2018, the Supreme Court denied that petition, deciding that the extraordinary circumstances for a petition for pre-judgment review were not met.\n\nThe Supreme Court almost always waits for a federal appeals court to render a final judgment in a case before deciding whether to review the matter. Surveys of Supreme Court precedent suggest that the justices have not bypassed the appellate courts since 2003.\n\nRule 11 is usually a fire alarm provision that is pulled when the house is burning down, legally speaking. The Supreme Court in its February denial included that it \u201cassumed that the Court of Appeals will proceed expeditiously to decide this case,\u201d and thus that the extraordinary measure was not necessary.\n\nBut even though the California case was argued on May 15, the Ninth Circuit has evidently ignored the Supreme Court\u2019s explicit expectations to decide it quickly.\n\nNow the January cutoff for new cases during the current Supreme Court term (October-June) is approaching, so Francisco filed a new petition for certiorari before judgment on November 5. He filed identical petitions in two other pending challenges, one from New York and the last from Washington, DC.\n\n\u201cAn immediate grant of certiorari is necessary to obtain an appropriately prompt resolution of this important dispute,\u201d the petition reads, noting that if the annual cutoff passes, \u201cthe government would be required to retain a discretionary non-enforcement policy that DHS and the Attorney General have correctly concluded is unlawful and that sanctions the ongoing violation of federal law by more than half a million people.\u201d\n\nThe respondents in these cases have 30 days to file briefs opposing the petitions, and the justices will decide by early January whether to take the cases. If granted, arguments would be in April, with a decision by the end of June 2019.\n\nThe names of the cases are U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Security v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., Nielsen v. Battalla Vidal, and Trump v. NAACP, all at the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court\u2019s clerk\u2019s office has not yet assigned docket numbers to these cases.\n\nKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

It must also be noted that the sample of Hispanic respondents carries a larger margin of error (+/-10%), but nonetheless, the numbers do represent a significant finding.\u201d\n\nThe Zogby poll included 866 likely voters and was conducted from October 30 to October 31. It also shows 57 percent of Americans support Trump\u2019s decision to send troops to the border to block the migrant caravans.\n\nMany polls show that second- or third-generation Latinos strongly support tougher border security, partly because they do not want their jobs, neighborhoods, schools, and civic image to be damaged by waves of poor, unskilled migrants.\n\nFor example, a 2014 poll by the pro-amnesty FWD.us lobbying group showed that 78 percent Latinos support \u201csubstantially increasing security among US-Mexican border. The poll also showed that 77 percent want companies to be required to check job applicants to seen out illegal migrants.

And we say this all the time, everyone says this, he\u2019s a liar. He uses hate. He uses fear. You know, I\u2019ve said this a million times, but I think that when a man can take children away from their parents and put them in cages, and he suffers no consequence, then I don\u2019t understand how we\u2019re America anymore.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cHe\u2019s such a misogynist. Secondly, he would take away the things that I have fought for since I was a young woman. And what I think is that a lot of these women, they\u2019re just voting straight Republican. He was a reality star, and he seems very kind of sexy or something. Also, he promises whatever. It\u2019s like, I\u2019ve never seen anybody lie so good. He would be the greatest actor because you can\u2019t really tell when he\u2019s lying and when he\u2019s telling the truth, and I find that actually amazing.

He slammed the left and the media for refusing to concede the 2016 election, repeatedly blaming it on racism and the Russians.\n\n\u201cThey say we\u2019re divisive, but we\u2019re not divisive, we\u2019re defending an America that has strayed from its founding,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing to do with race, nothing to do with gender \u2026 it has to do with culture, it has to do with protecting the Constitution. Pure and simple.\u201d\n\nLimbaugh said it was \u201ca great honor\u201d to be a guest at one of Trump\u2019s electrifying rallies, noting that they were the \u201cenvy\u201d of professional Washington, DC.\n\n\u201cThey are jealous, they are envious, this isn\u2019t supposed to happen, you people are supposed to love them, not Trump,\u201d Limbaugh said.\n\nHe noted that Bill and Hillary Clinton recently announced a multi-city speaking tour and that Obama was back on the campaign trail looking to eclipse Trump\u2019s success.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden can\u2019t fill a phone booth because he\u2019s looking for someone to punch out,\u201d Limbaugh joked.\n\nHe said that the Trump rallies convinced him that Trump would win in 2016 because he had such a great connection with voters.\n\n\u201cThe people in Washington really haven\u2019t taken the time to understand why you voted for Trump; they just think you\u2019re stupid for doing so,\u201d he said.\n\nLimbaugh praised Trump for his willingness to fight for the American people, despite the unrelenting criticism from the left and the media.\n\n\u201cEven now, the real anger at Trump is actually at you for having elected him,\u201d he said.", "House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) on Monday expressed optimism that Republicans will hold the House, a day before voters head to the polls on Tuesday in a midterm election.\n\n\u201cI feel good,\u201d Ryan told Bret Baier on Fox News\u2019s Special Report in an interview from Janesville, WI. \u201cFrankly, our members feel pretty good because they have a really good message.\u201d\n\nHe said Republicans have a record of achievement over the last two years under the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cLook at what we\u2019ve been able to achieve in Congress with the President over the last two years: a record economy, the military being rebuilt, people feeling better about things, more jobs being offered in America today than people looking for jobs, wages growing faster than they have since before the recession,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause of all of this, our candidates feel like they have a great message, and the alternative is the chaos and dysfunction in Washington that the Democrats are basically promising if they get control of Congress. So, we really feel like we\u2019ve got a good shot at keeping our majority because our record is so good and the contrast is so strong.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that historically, the party opposite the president\u2019s gains more seats in the midterms. But he said he remains \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe already are standing against a historical trend that cuts against us, but the reason I feel like this is going to be really, really close, and I feel cautiously optimistic, is because of our record. He continued:\n\nWe have done so much. We\u2019ve passed over a thousand bills in the House in just the last two years, making a huge difference. Tackling opioids, human trafficking, rebuilding the military, overhauling the VA, deregulating the economy, creating jobs and jobs, and wages, and overhauling the tax system, among many other things. So it\u2019s been an enormous record of accomplishment.\n\nRyan contrasted that with what he predicted would happen if Democrats and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) take control of the House \u2014 \u201cchaos and gridlock.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll try to impeach the President. They want to abolish I.C.E., and that\u2019s the agency that guards our border, that stops drugs from coming into our country. And they want socialized medicine, which would be a disaster for our country, plus a $32 trillion tax increase to pay for it. So, I think the contrast is clear. That\u2019s why I think we\u2019ve got a really good chance because history, although it\u2019s not our friend, we have a good record that can help combat that,\u201d Ryan said.", "The Bishop of Ciudad Juarez urged the faithful Sunday to tear down the walls that have been built against migrants, exhorting them to lend their full support to migrants.\n\nDuring his homily at Sunday Mass in the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez cathedral, Bishop Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Campos Torres lamented the conditions in which many Central American families travel in their efforts to reach the United States to achieve the American dream.\n\nThe bishop noted that a number of Guatemalan, Cuban, and Honduran migrants are already present in the city, and many are on the Santa Fe and Zaragoza bridges waiting to be called to apply for political asylum in the United States.

Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) recently spoke to students at Manchester High School in Manchester, Connecticut, criticizing President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI think implicitly [Trump] has condoned or encouraged some of the worst instincts in the some of the most misguided people in our society,\u201d Blumenthal said in a Journal Inquirer report. \u201cThe use of certain code words \u2014 \u2018nationalists,\u2019 \u2018globalists,\u2019 \u2018invaders\u2019 \u2014 sends signals to people who populate the Internet \u2026 with messages of hatred.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hate speech can lead to hate crimes,\u201d Blumenthal said.\n\nAnd while Blumenthal is not facing re-election on Tuesday, he was speaking to some students who are old enough to cast a vote in the election.\n\nBreitbart News contacted the Manchester School Board to ask a series of questions about Blumenthal\u2019s \u201ctown hall,\u201d including whether or not someone with a conservative worldview would be invited to speak to students.\n\nBreitbart News also asked if parents were involved in giving their children permission to miss class to attend a partisan political event and if students were allowed to opt-out.\n\nJim Farrell, attendance and communication director and safe school climate coordinator for the district, emailed Breitbart News the following statements \u2014 the second statement came after Breitbart News followed up to point out the first did not directly answer many of the questions asked.\n\nSenator Blumenthal reached out to the high school principal about holding a town hall style meeting with students. The high school principal asked for permission from Superintendent Matt Geary, who approved the visit. This was not a partisan event but instead an opportunity for students in human rights classes, a global studies seminar, and our student equity team to ask questions of a sitting U.S. senator who is not currently up for re-election and to be able to hear his thoughts on critical issues facing our state and country. Students did move in and out of the town hall meeting as they were allowed to go to classes that they did not feel they should miss. We frequently welcome visitors from outside of the school district itself as we believe our students benefit from the interaction and exposure to people with \u2018real world\u2019 experiences and different points of view. In fact, the day after Sen. Blumenthal\u2019s visit, students at one of our elementary schools had the opportunity to meet and hear from Jeff Kinney, author of the best-selling book series \u201cDiary of a Wimpy Kid.\u201d In all of our classes we always try to take a balanced, unbiased look at anything we are studying. Teachers make every possible attempt in our practice to push kids to think critically, look at multiple perspectives, and weigh all opinions around an issue or topic. We have had opportunities in the past to have leaders from both sides of the aisle come into school. There have been social studies classes (government, economics) that have welcomed in guest speakers from both sides to give kids a balanced perspective on a particular issue or topic. During the Blumenthal visit several of the students expressed frustration with progress under politicians from both sides \u2013 support for Veterans, tax breaks for companies hiring people with certain Visas rather than citizens, frustration and disbelief that current politicians can make forward progress in a bipartisan way.\n\nBlumenthal also criticized Trump for his efforts to stop thousands of migrants from Central America and elsewhere who are headed through Mexico to the U.S. border.\n\nHe also claimed Trump was separating families, although those separations are required by U.S. law and have been in place for years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at this class and your diversity,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cThis is America, this is what makes America great.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so separating children from parents as a means to deter people or discourage people is not only inhumane \u2014 it\u2019s also very much against our national interest,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cWe need that talent and energy and passion.\u201d\n\nThe Journal Inquirer reported:\n\nThe students who attended the event came from classes in human rights, a global studies seminar, and a student equity team at the high school. Social studies teacher Jake Skrzypiec said that these classes seek to empower students to be informed citizens and participants in difficult, nuanced discussions about morality, ethics, and sometimes even heavier topics such as genocide.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important they hear from a representative \u2014 a senator \u2014 who will give some meaning to their voices,\u201d Skrzypiec said.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "President Donald Trump will hold his final rally before Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections in Cape Girardeau, MIssouri, on Monday evening.\n\nConservative radio icon Rush Limbaugh will make an appearance in his hometown and Sean Hannity will also be in attendance and interview Trump at the event.\n\nTrump will campaign for GOP Senate candidate Josh Hawley as he seeks to unseat Sen.

Marsha Blackburn (R-TN-07) leads of eight points and nine points over Democrat nominee Phil Bredesen, an average of eight-and-a-half points.\n\nThe Emerson College Poll conducted between October 28 and October 30 gives Blackburn an eight point lead, 52 percent to 44 percent.\n\nThe Fox News Poll conducted between October 28 and October 30 gives Blackburn a nine point lead, 50 percent to 41 percent.\n\nAs recently as a month ago, the Real Clear Politics Average of Polls showed the race as a statistical tie.\n\nBut Bredesen has stumbled badly over the past several weeks, and Blackburn has benefited from her steadfast support of President Trump, who headlined a rally attended by an estimated 12,000 people in Chattanooga on Sunday night to support her candidacy.\n\nOn October 2, the Real Clear Politics Average of Polls showed the race to be dead even, with each candidate receiving 46.5 percent of the vote.\n\nNine days later, on October 11, Blackburn had jumped out to a 5.5 point lead, 49.3 percent to 43.8 percent, and she has maintained a lead ever since.\n\nThat jump in the polls tracks very closely with the release of the first polls conducted after the dramatic testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford on September 27, who alleged, without providing any corroborating evidence, that Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her 36 years earlier. Kavanaugh emphatically denied those allegations in testimony before the committee later that day.\n\nIn contrast to Blackburn, who announced her unwavering support for Kavanaugh on July 9, the day he was nominated by President Trump, and vigorously defended him throughout the confirmation process, Bredesen remained silent throughout almost that entire period of time.\n\nOnly on October 5, the day before the final vote when the U.S. Senate confirmed Kavanaugh by a 50 to 48 margin, did Bredesen announce his tepid support for Kavanaugh, a statement that many Tennessee voters believed at the time was an insincere effort to appeal to Republicans.\n\nThat perceived insincerity was confirmed by a Project Veritas undercover video released on October 10 which showed Bredesen campaign staffers stating unequivocally that Bredesen did not really support Kavanaugh and only issued a statement of support to win Republican voters.\n\nBredesen\u2019s truthfulness also took a big hit with Tennessee voters when he claimed that, if elected, he would not support Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to be the leader of Senate Democrats. That claim did not pass the smell test with many voters in Tennessee, given that Schumer personally recruited Bredesen to run for the Senate in Tennessee, has hosted fundraisers for him in New York City, and has spent more than $12 million to support his candidacy and oppose Blackburn through his Senate Majority PAC.\n\nBredesen\u2019s latest stumble on the campaign trail came last week when he laughingly claimed that the migrant army of several thousand Hondurans currently marching through Mexico, intent on entering the United States illegally, do not represent a national security threat.\n\nBredesen is counting on two things to pull off an upset on Tuesday: (1) the sheer volume of spending by his campaign and Schumer\u2019s Senate Majority PAC on behalf of his candidacy, and (2) an increased turnout from younger voters, energized by pop superstar Taylor Swift\u2019s endorsement of his candidacy.\n\nMost political observers in Tennessee are skeptical that will be enough for Bredesen, who has already told MSNBC that if he loses, it will be because of the failing national Democrat brand.", "Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s special envoy Alexander Lavrentiev arrived in Tehran, Iran, Monday to express Moscow\u2019s rejection of the fresh round of U.S. sanctions.\n\n\u201cMoscow will do everything it can to preserve and expand international trade, economic and financial cooperation with Iran despite the US sanctions,\u201d the state-run TASS news agency declares, citing the Russian foreign ministry.\n\nOn Monday, Putin\u2019s special envoy met with Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Tehran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, in the Iranian capital.\n\nIranian media outlet Tasnim News Agency notes:\n\nThe Russian envoy said he has traveled to Iran on Putin\u2019s orders for a twin mission: to give a report on a recent 4-party meeting of Russia, Turkey, Germany and France on the situation in Syria that was held in Istanbul, and to voice Moscow\u2019s unequivocal support for Iran against the fresh round of US sanctions \u2026 The visiting envoy also called for concreted action by the international community to stand against US unilateralism, and denounced the use of economic and trade options for imposing a country\u2019s political will on others.\n\nIran and Russia are close allies in Syria.

That\u2019s a petty campaign lie. As this piece in the New York Post details, President Donald Trump is actually helping people with pre-existing conditions get access to coverage:\n\nHow Trump\u2019s helped people with pre-existing conditions and major health issues https://t.co/SG2KwBqVGL pic.twitter.com/otsvOix4oG \u2014 NY Post Opinion (@NYPostOpinion) November 5, 2018\n\nThe piece from GOP strategist Mary Vought, whose husband Russ Vought works as deputy director at the Trump administration\u2019s Office of Management and Budget (OMB), details how Trump has \u201ctaken several vital steps to reorient the federal bureaucracy toward the chronically ill and individuals with pre-existing conditions.\u201d\n\nThose steps include expanded access to prescription drugs, more coverage options for families, and an \u201cembrace of state flexibility in Medicaid.\u201d\n\nI'm proud that @realDonaldTrump is working to help the sickest among us. My latest for the @nypost https://t.co/0HZQpa0gaN \u2014 Mary Vought (@MaryVought) November 5, 2018\n\nWhile the Democrats\u2019 claims about Republicans on healthcare are nothing more than inaccurate cheap political parlor tricks\u2013everyone from President Trump to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and everyone in between on the GOP side has guaranteed pre-existing condition coverage\u2013the Democrats have an abysmal record on pre-existing condition coverage.\n\nIn fact, it is Democrats\u2013through Obamacare\u2013who have harmed pre-existing condition coverage.\n\nIn early October, the Federalist\u2019s Christopher Jacobs published a bombshell piece headlined: \u201cHow AARP Made Billions Denying Care to People with Pre-Existing Conditions.\u201d\n\nThe article details how the structure of Obamacare, through its alteration of Medicare program, harmed Medicare beneficiaries and pushed billions of dollars to special interest groups like AARP that benefited from the changes. Jacobs wrote:\n\nEven though an article on AARP\u2019s own website states that, as of 2014, \u201cinsurance companies [are] required to sell policies to anyone, regardless of their pre-existing medical conditions,\u201d that claim isn\u2019t quite accurate. Obamacare exempted Medigap supplemental insurance plans from all of its \u2018reforms,\u2019 including the prohibition on \u2018discriminating\u2019 against individuals with pre-existing conditions. As a 2011 Washington Post article noted, individuals can apply for Medigap plans when they first turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare. \u2018However, when Congress created this protection in 1992\u2026it exempted disabled Medicare beneficiaries under age 65, a group that now totals 8 million people.\u2019 In other words, the most vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries\u2014those enrolled because they receive Social Security disability benefits\u2014often cannot obtain Medigap coverage due to pre-existing conditions. And because traditional Medicare does not provide a catastrophic cap on patient cost-sharing (Medigap plans often provide that coverage instead), disabled beneficiaries who want to remain in traditional Medicare (as opposed to Medicare Advantage plans offered by private insurers) may face unlimited out-of-pocket spending.\n\nIn other words, the AARP has made billions off the Medigap loophole in Obamacare\u2013and it is because of Democrats that Obamacare does not close this loophole. Early versions of Obamacare would have stopped AARP and other Medigap providers from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions, but Democrats\u2013in the legislative process as Obamacare wormed its way through Capitol Hill before it made its way to then President Barack Obama\u2019s desk\u2013removed that language so the AARP and other groups like it would benefit.\n\nFast forward years later, as Obamacare has settled into law, and the AARP has indeed made billions off this\u2013and the group is interestingly now spreading the wealth back around to the Democrats.\n\nIn fact, AARP\u2019s 990 form filed with the IRS in 2016\u2013the latest such form publicly available as of publication\u2013shows the AARP paying a whopping $36,321,292 to GMMB. GMMB\u2019s services rendered, per the 990 form, are serving as an \u201cadvertising firm\u201d for AARP.\n\nBut who exactly is GMMB? GMMB is indeed an advertising agency, and bills itself on its website as such:\n\nWe\u2019re an agency on a mission: to cause the effect. The world our clients and partners fight for is the world we want to live in. We come from political campaigns, nonprofits, creative agencies, and the media. We bring our diverse skills and experiences to bear on societal problems, big and small.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just any old advertising agency. Among its clients, it counts none other than former President Barack Obama\u2013yes, that Obama, the one for whom Obamacare is named.\n\nIn fact, GMMB details on its Obama page how as a firm it \u201cwas there every step of the way\u201d for Obama\u2019s unlikely rise into the Oval Office. GMMB says on its website:\n\nIn 2007, Obama for America asked GMMB to serve as a lead strategic firm in his historic run for the Presidency. We were honored to play a vital role in both the hotly-contested primary and the dramatic general election campaign. Facing a tough re-election battle in 2012, Obama for America again called on GMMB to help guide strategy and advertising and to handle media placement.\u201dNow, interestingly, as Obamacare has come under scrutiny with a GOP-led Congress and from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, the AARP has, as part of a larger coalition, went all in to try to protect Obamacare\u2013and the system that makes the group billions of dollars.The Washington Post, for instance, in 2017 after the House passed a bill that would have repealed Obamacare but protected pre-existing coverage\u2013and removed the AARP\u2019s Medigap loophole\u2013reported that AARP was part of \u201ca coalition of medical and consumer groups [that] held an event in Cleveland that was billed as the first of a series of gatherings to speak out against a bill that passed the GOP-controlled House and the direction that Republican senators appear to be heading.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, AARP issued a press release in 2017 opposing changes to the law.\n\nNancy LeaMond, AARP executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, said in the press release:\n\nAARP strongly opposes any attempts to take away the ACA\u2019s protection for people with preexisting health conditions or to bring back an unfair age tax on older adults. Allowing insurance companies to once again charge people with high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer, diabetes or other conditions up to 10 times more than what others pay for the same coverage \u2014 or deny them coverage altogether \u2014 would be devastating to the estimated 25 million older adults with a preexisting condition.\n\nBack then, during the Obama administration, Republicans had a more difficult time fighting this AARP carveout. But now, Trump administration officials are well aware of it, one former White House official told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cAARP raked in billions in profits thanks to an Obamacare carve-out the Democrats gave them,\u201d a senior former West Wing aide in the Trump White House told Breitbart News. \u201cThen they spent millions trying to preserve this special deal, including doling out over $36 million to Obama\u2019s favorite ad agency. And for what, to help seniors? No, to continue being able to deny care to vulnerable people with pre-existing conditions.\u201d\n\nAnd Republicans, if they do hold the House and add seats in the Senate, are likely to target AARP\u2019s special interest Obamacare carve-outs that make the group billions of dollars off denying people with pre-existing conditions any coverage.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly the type of corporate behavior that should raise red flags with the consumers that they rely on to stay in business \u2014 in the case of AARP, those consumers are mostly elderly people on fixed incomes,\u201d Arthur Schwartz, a GOP strategist and former senior strategic adviser to insurance titan Maurice R. \u201cHank\u201d Greenberg, told Breitbart News.\n\nIt remains to be seen what will happen in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, and afterwards it remains to be seen what will happen with healthcare. But in the meantime, AARP will keep raking in big money from it, and Americans with pre-existing conditions remain at risk until these loopholes are closed.", "CNN reporter Jim Acosta signed an autograph for a Trump fan at a rally Monday by writing \u201cCNN is real news.\u201d\n\nIn a video posted by CNN producer Matt Hoye, Jim Acosta shows off a Trump sign he autographed reading \u201cCNN is real news.\u201d On the other side, a Trump fan had written \u201cCNN is fake news.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt last realDonaldTrump Trump rally of the season for us in Fort Wayne, Indiana Acosta got dozens of requests to sign autographs but this one cracked me up. cnn realnews,\u201d CNN\u2019s Matt Hoye said in a tweet.\n\nAt last @realDonaldTrump #Trump rally of the season for us in Fort Wayne, Indiana @Acosta got dozens of requests to sign autographs but this one cracked me up. #cnn #realnews pic.twitter.com/XJMQXSfyVN \u2014 Matt Hoye (@mattyhoyeCNN) November 6, 2018\n\nThough Acosta seems to be having the time of his life with the rally goers, he has previously said that Trump rallies make him \u201cdepressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want to ask me what makes me most depressed about my job, it\u2019s covering the rallies.

It was not clear if the effective chief executive of the country, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, would accompany his father.\n\nThe crown prince has been accused of either masterminding or knowingly permitting Khashoggi\u2019s killing in Turkey. The monarchy insists the October 2 murder was the work of rogue agents exceeding their authority.\n\nSaudi media reported King Salman will \u201claunch health, education, and infrastructure projects\u201d during his tour. The Financial Times bluntly described the king\u2019s tour as an effort to \u201ccontain fallout\u201d from the Khashoggi killing and \u201creassert his authority\u201d after delegating enormous powers to Crown Prince Mohammed.\n\nAnother recent sign the crown prince\u2019s power could be scaled back as a result of the crisis is the return of Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz to Riyadh last week. Prince Ahmed is the younger brother of King Salman, making him one of the most senior Saudi royals. He departed for self-imposed exile in London six years ago and has reportedly been reluctant to return because of Crown Prince Mohammed\u2019s growing power and Prince Ahmed\u2019s stern criticism of his actions, particularly the Saudi military involvement in Yemen.\n\n\u201cThe king is caught in a situation.

Here are the ads blacklisted by the social media platform.\n\nAs the November midterm elections approach, social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter have been cracking down on what they consider \u201cmisinformation\u201d on their platforms; Twitter has deleted 10,000 accounts at the request of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The DCCC reportedly began working to have social media websites crack down on certain accounts following the spread of \u201cmisinformation\u201d about Hillary Clinton and other Democratic candidates during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election.\n\nFacebook has also begun cracking down on certain messages on their platform, particularly in the case of ads. Interestingly, Facebook has become quite particular about the ads they allow on their platform in the past few weeks, despite VICE News regularly fooling the website into running ads that stated they were paid for by Vice President Mike Pence, President Trump and even ISIS with little to no verification of their legitimacy whatsoever.\n\nHere are the Republican ads blocked by Facebook in recent months.\n\n1: California congressional candidate Elizabeth Heng\n\nBreitbart News reported in August that Republican congressional candidate Elizabeth Heng\u2019s campaign video ad about the communist crimes that led her family to flee Cambodia for the U.S. was removed from Facebook, with the platform claiming that it doesn\u2019t allow \u201cshocking, disrespectful, or sensational\u201d content. Heng tweeted a link to the ad on YouTube; she also asked Facebook if they thought they had the right to censor history.\n\n.@facebook rejected my video because it was \u201ctoo shocking\u201d for their platform, referring to the scenes of horrific events my parents survived in Cambodia.

The ad can be watched below:\n\nAt the time, Heng commented on the issue saying: \u201cIt is unbelievable that Facebook could have such blatant disregard for the history that so many people, including my own parents, have lived through,\u201d declared Heng in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m sure it is shocking for some people to hear about this kind of injustice, but this is reality. This is why I wake up every single day with the fight and determination to have a voice and make a difference in my community.\u201d\n\nFacebook reinstated the ad, with a Facebook spokesperson stating: \u201cUpon further review, it is clear the video contains historical imagery relevant to the candidate\u2019s story. We have since approved the ad and it is now running on Facebook.\u201d\n\n2: Rep. Marsha Blackburn\n\nBreitbart News reported recently that a Susan B. Anthony List ad promoting Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) has now been restored. Breitbart News reporter Sean Moran writes:\n\nOn Thursday, Facebook decided not to approve one of Susan B. Anthony List\u2019s ads within one week of the contentious 2018 midterm elections, which raises the question of social media companies\u2019 undue influence in American electoral politics. The Susan B. Anthony List ad chastises Tennessee Senate Democrat candidate Phil Bredesen for his pro-choice views, while also promoting Tennessee Republican Blackburn as a \u201cpro-life champion.\u201d Facebook responded to Breitbart News\u2019s request for comment on Thursday, explaining that the ad should have never been disapproved and that they have restored the Susan B.

The banning of the ad provided a stark contrast to Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s comments relating specifically to pro-life ads on the platform. In an interview with Axios, Sandberg asked rhetorically, \u201cThe question is, \u2018Should divisive political or issue ads run?\u2019\u201d She continued to say: \u201cOur answer is yes \u2013 because when you cut off speech for one person, you cut off speech for all people.\u201d\n\n3: President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration ad\n\nBreitbart News reported today that Facebook refused to approve an ad spot from President Trump, one which was also pulled from Fox News on Monday.

This decision follows a campaign to have the ads removed by left-wing journalists. President Trump\u2019s 2020 Campaign Manager, Brad Parscale, was quick to fire back at the platform. Parscale said that Facebook has \u201cchosen to stand with those ILLEGALLY IN THIS COUNTRY. Instead of standing with LEGAL IMMIGRANTS and those that follow our laws.\u201d He also referred to Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s company as part of the \u201cPalo Alto Mafia,\u201d a term he has previously used to refer to Silicon Valley companies censoring conservatives.\n\nAs Kraychick notes, Brad Parscale hit back at the social media firm; his tweet can be seen below:\n\nSo, @NBCNews @CNN @facebook have chosen to stand with those ILLEGALLY IN THIS COUNTRY.

But many of their parents may choose to leave some of the 1,2014 children and youths in the United States when judges eject the parents\u2019 asylum pleas.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people from Central America who are willing to leave their kids here, rather than take them back,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies. He continued:\n\nEspecially if there is relative here [in the United States], or if the child is close to 18 and can get a job and send the money home, it makes perfect sense. It does not mean in every instance that the illegal migrant knew what they are doing and planned to drop their kids off, but it does add some nuance to the sob stories that the media has been retailing.\n\nThe high percentage of children deliberately left by their parents contradicts the media\u2019s anguished narrative that the children were cruelly \u201cripped\u201d from their uncomprehending parents\u2019 arms.\n\nInstead, the data reinforces the abundant evidence that journalists do not want to recognize how poor Central American migrants are rationally exploiting the United State\u2019s asylum system to win green cards and education for their children.\n\nMany wealthy foreign parents, including many Chinese and Russians, use a different strategy to win citizenship for their foreign children. They fly into the United States long enough to give birth on American soil and to pick up their child\u2019s new Social Security Numbers.\n\nThe number of abandoned Central American children will likely rise as U.S. immigration courts order the deportation of the remaining 2,o00 migrant parents who were released and reunited with their 2,104 children. Since their release, the 2,000 parents and their 2,104 children are allowed to live and work in the United States until a judge decide their pleas for asylum, likely in 2020 or 2021.\n\nData from prior years suggest that few of the migrants\u2019 pleas for asylum will be approved by a judge and that most will be ordered home. But the available data also suggest that most migrants skip their final hearing to dodge deportation by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cMost of the kids and parents are probably here to stay, and that\u2019s what they and the smugglers and the anti-border activists are counting on,\u201d Krikorian said. \u201cHow much effort is ICE going to put into picking up some 12-year-old whose asylum claim has been turned down?\u201d\n\nTrump canceled the zero-tolerance enforcement program in June amid an outpouring of emotional complaints from pro-migration media personalities, pro-migration activists, and from Democratic politicians. The enforcement program was portrayed as a cruel \u201cfamily separation\u201d program, even though the 2015 Flores judicial agreement approved by President Barack Obama requires that children be housed separately when their parents are detained for longer than 20 days.\n\nTrump announced a new strategy on November 1 to block the growing number of Central American migrants who make asylum requests to help walk past the border guards and into U.S. jobs.\n\nThe new plan will use tent cities to detain migrants and their children until their asylum pleas are resolved in as little as 40 days. The plan also replaces the Flores court decision with a new regulation allowing detention of children \u2014 with their parents \u2014 for more than 20 days.\n\nThe plan was praised by Krikorian. \u2018They should not be releasing anyone who applies for asylum in the first place \u2026 The goal should be that every asylum applicant is held during the entire course of the proceedings,\u201d he said, but added that pro-migration groups will likely get friendly judges to block the plan.\n\nThe HHS data sheet shows that 2,104 children have been released from the agency\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement and then reunited with their migrant parents prior to court hearings.\n\nThe HHS data also shows that the group of roughly 500 abandoned children and youths is comprised of:\n\nOne hundred and eighteen children who have been left in government care by their parents since the parents\u2019 deportation, according to a count by the Ameican Civil Liberties Union. Forty-three additional children remain in government care \u201cbecause further review shows they were not separated from parents by DHS.\u201d Thirty-three additional children are \u201cin [government] care where a final determination has been made they cannot be reunified because the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child.\u201d Thirty-three children are in government care while the parents are outside the United States. Another 14 children have parents in the United States but have not been reunited with their parents, for reasons that are unexplained by HHS. Three hundred children have been released from HHS because they have become adults who can file for asylum themselves, or because they are being sheltered by other people, mostly the relatives of the migrants. The released children and youths are free to work in Americans\u2019 workplaces and to use Americans\u2019 schools. Some of those children and youths may be living close to or with their released parents prior to their asylum hearings.\n\nIf the 300 are excluded from the overall tally, the number of left-behind children remains at 200.\n\nOverall, Washington\u2019s economic policy of using migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor.

Like many of the terms employed by political journalists, it has no specific definition. Unlike the formal sciences, political, and social science invoke and employ terms having only tentative discursive or lexical definition\u2014usually framed as criterial definitions in which some properties are advanced as definitive of the concept. Thus, we are told that \u201cpopulism\u201d refers to a political strategy calculated to address the felt needs of the general population as distinct from, and usually opposed to, the settled preferences of the \u201cestablishment.\u201d\n\nSuch a definition is so loosely framed that it can be applied to almost any significant variation in customary politics. Thus we are informed that V. I. Lenin, Benito Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler all were \u201cpopulists\u201d\u2014as were Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, and Pol Pot. As such, the term means little more than \u201crevolutionary.\u201d We are now told that the current president of the United States, as a populist, is somehow a member of such a list. We are assured that like Mussolini, President Donald J. Trump is a \u201cfascist.\u201d\n\nIntelligent persons tell us that all this is very serious\u2014but fail to offer a supporting analysis. At best, such a claim is preliminary, heuristic, and research suggestive. What is needed is an \u201cunpacking\u201d of the concept of \u201cpopulism\u201d\u2014to demonstrate the substantive similarities between the populisms of Mussolini and Trump. That minimally requires the provision of an applicable historic context and measurable specifics.\n\nWe are provided some assistance in that regard when we are told that, as president of the United States, one of the first foreign politicians Trump chose to meet was Nigel Farage, leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party. Both populists\u2014each in his own country\u2014addressed themselves to what each conceived was a neglected audience and potential constituency: domestic nationalists and traditionalists. Their opponents were, and are, the politically liberal globalists and Europeanists who dominate the \u201cestablishment.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama, Trump\u2019s predecessor, had made a point of his anationalism. For a time, by way of illustration, he refused to wear the traditional flag lapel pin worn by politicians in office. He regularly renounced any claim that the United States exhibited national \u201cexceptionalism.\u201d He advised Americans that they should accustom themselves to a more modest, and undistinguished, national economic productive rate of less than 2% per annum. He materially reduced defense spending so that the United States would no longer loom large as a military power. He increased welfare provisions as evidence of national vulnerabilities. Whatever his ultimate intentions might have been, it seemed clear that he wished to dampen national sentiment. Trump\u2019s call to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d was seen as antithetical, and offensive, to all of that.\n\nIn the Western industrialized states nationalism has been largely in disfavor since the conclusion of the Second World War. The reasons are many and varied and need not detain us. What we are obliged to do is understand something of how a damping of national sentiment is undertaken and propagated.\n\nOne need only attend the lecture halls of American institutions of advanced learning to come away with an awareness of what is transpiring. The atmosphere there is thick with pervasive anationalism. Lecturers in social science, liberal arts, and law will opine in excruciating detail about the history of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of North America undertaken by \u201cinvading hordes of White settlers.\u201d They will be eloquent in the account of the horrors that attended the enslavement of Blacks\u2014and the exploitation of immigrant labor to satisfy the rapacity of \u201cBig Business.\u201d That is generally coupled with detailed renderings of abuses suffered by homosexuals, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender individuals\u2014anyone who does not conform to traditional norms.\n\nThese sentiments are reinforced in the entertainment media and repeated in many of our churches. Failure to accept the message without resistance exposes one to charges of \u201cracism\u201d and \u201chomophobia.\u201d Among the results one finds a measureable change in attitude toward national symbols in the general population\u2014and on university campuses many students will more readily fly the flag of some Third World country than that of their own nation. Those who resist are cast into the bushel of \u201cdeplorables.\u201d They are those who irrationally \u201ccling to their Bibles and guns.\u201d\n\nTrump took issue with all of that. He has sought to reanimate the United States with a soft, or sentimental (if well-armed) nationalism. His populism depicts the nation as an admirable cultural and historic continuity\u2014neither biological nor class-based. It finds its strength not in a particular ideology, but in traditional symbols\u2014in its history, its flag and its national anthem. His is a relatively benign form of nationalism. He is not a statist. His nationalism is neither aggressive nor expansionist. He will use, or invoke, the threat of violence whenever he is convinced (at times perhaps incorrectly) that the security, territory, or citizens of the nation are in jeopardy. Unlike other nationalisms, that of Trump\u2019s United States has no specific racial reference; it has no irredentist claims on the territory of others, nor does it seek to secure external \u201cvital spaces\u201d to supply it resources.\n\nAll that makes the media response to his self-identification as a \u201cnationalist\u201d decidedly curious. Trump speaks to the sentiments of common people of the United States\u2014and every survey of that population shows it overwhelmingly prideful of the nation and respectful of its symbols. He speaks to that sentiment when he commits himself to making the nation \u201cgreat again,\u201d to have it respected and admired. That is why he seeks a restoration of its industrial base\u2014by making a direct appeal to the immediate material interests of workers\u2014promising increments in pay and benefits, together with comprehensive tax cuts. His intention to reindustrialize the nation through the reduction of regulatory constraints and tax cuts favoring business has a following among entrepreneurs\u2014and his plan to construct a wall along the nation\u2019s southern border to ensure the territorial integrity of the nation against uncontrolled immigration has engaged the support of those who fear the impairment of sovereignty as well as a dilution of traditional culture. Increases in defense spending are seen as contributions to the defense of both national security and sovereignty. All of this is inspired by nationalism.\n\nSuch policies constitute the core of Trump\u2019s populism\u2014and resulted in an electoral coalition that won him the presidency. Whatever data we have (and it is fragmentary and uncertain at best) indicates that his coalition is composed, in substantial part, of voters characterized by a relatively low level of advanced (post-secondary school) education, relatively low annual income, and relatively little in personal savings. As such, many of those attracted by Trump have probably avoided much of the liberal indoctrination irresistible at university, and actively welcome the reindustrialization of the nation and attendant benefits. They are relatively insecure and many are concerned that an unrestricted flow of immigration might jeopardize their employment opportunities and standard-of-living circumstances.\n\nBeyond that relatively stable core, the electoral coalition contains important segments of potential instability. With the improving economic circumstances, and consequent full employment, business interests\u2014both agricultural and industrial\u2014may find Trump\u2019s attempted populist control of immigration unserviceable. They might prefer the flow of low wage, unskilled labor that unrestricted immigration delivers.\n\nThere is suggestive evidence that such a concern may have already matured. Although his Republicans have a legislative majority in the national congress, Trump has been unable to secure the funds to construct his border wall. Members of his own party have shown reluctance to provide the requisite monies. Many Republicans in congress represent business constituencies, and their evident reluctance to fund Trump\u2019s border wall may reflect those interests.\n\nAs workers find employment in the reindustrializing economy, and as their life circumstances become more secure, their interests may well turn elsewhere. Their nationalism is open textured. It then becomes unclear what their future political dispositions may be. One can hardly have confidence that their enthusiasm for Trump\u2019s populism will continue unabated. Some polls suggest that the support for the policies that won Trump the presidency may already be dissipating. Opposed to all that we have the unwavering opposition to his populism by well-entrenched progressives and liberals.\n\nTrump\u2019s election to the presidency of the nation precipitated an unprecedented hysteria among establishment globalists and anationalists. The entirety of the communications, educational, and entertainment media has been, and resolutely remain, opposed to everything he proposes. Liberal control of the universities ensures the continued production of anti-Trump professors, journalists, lawyers, essayists and entertainers\u2014so that when his support base diminishes in any measure, and for whatever reason, there are anti-Trump replacements ready to fill the vacancies.\n\nUnder any circumstances, Trump can only be president for a maximum of eight years. The Constitution of the United States prohibits any more than that. Once out of office, a successor can undo virtually everything accomplished. Little other than his appointments to the Supreme Court can have enduring effect. Given the nature of his populism, it can only be largely transient.\n\nUninhibited by reality, Trump\u2019s opponents have chosen to attack the legitimacy of his presidency by charging him with \u201cracism,\u201d \u201chomophobia,\u201d \u201cmisogyny,\u201d and the \u201cpromotion of violence.\u201d Perhaps the most outrageous charge against Trump\u2019s populism is that it is \u201cfascist.\u201d No other word in the lexicon of contemporary politics evokes so emphatic a repugnance. It conjures up images of racial oppression and genocide, against a background of absolute dictatorship and unrelieved oppression.\n\nHowever popular the notion may be in some circles, none of this applies to the populism of Trump. Unless one chooses to speak at a level of abstraction at which virtually anything can be said, there is no fascism in Trump\u2019s populism.\n\nThose who advance the claim often argue that Trump\u2019s populism is nationalistic\u2014so was the populism of Benito Mussolini. But then, virtually every modern populism has been, or is, nationalistic. The cry of the Marxist fidelistas of Cuba is \u201cthe fatherland or death.\u201d There has never been a question of the nationalism of Mao Zedong. Even Josef Stalin, the Marxist internationalist, had to ultimately seek to instill \u201cpatriotism\u201d in his populism\u2014and there is no question about the nationalism of Vladimir Putin\u2019s populism. A sense of national pride certainly does not make Trump\u2019s populism fascist.\n\nThen, there is the question of charisma. Mussolini was charismatic\u2014so is Trump. However the term is defined, it is agreed that both Trump and Mussolini can be so characterized\u2014as can almost every other populist leader. The history of populist politics, in fact, is littered with charismatic figures.\n\nOnce one moves below the level of such abstractions, one recognizes the vastness that separates the populism of Trump from that of historic fascism. In the first place, Trump\u2019s populism plays out in a viable representative democracy. At best, he can serve a total of eight years. The situation for fascism was fundamentally different.\n\nFirst of all, historic fascism arose through violence. The representative system into which it injected itself was fragile. Organized socialism, some elements of which aped Lenin\u2019s Bolshevism, had seized major factories in the industrial regions of the peninsula. Municipalities had been taken by armed \u201cRed Guards\u201d\u2014returning veterans had been assaulted. The response to all of this by the government was tepid. Citizens feared not only the loss of their property, but their lives as well. The result was a massive, if inarticulate, resistance on the part of the general population.\n\nIn 1919, Mussolini founded a movement predicated on a response to what he and his followers understood to be a betrayal of a military victory purchased at staggering cost. Even before the end of the Great War, Mussolini had spoken of the \u201caristocracy of the trenches\u201d as his intended recruitment base. He sought to mass mobilize the hundreds of thousands of combat veterans to mount an armed resistance to organized, anti-nationalist, and anti-military, socialism\u2014as well as the liberal government that supplied it its environment.\n\nHis call resonated not only among combat veterans, but among property holders and nationalists as well. In the course of fascism\u2019s mobilization, it received collateral support from the national security forces that had been vilified by organized socialism. We have convincing evidence that the security forces assisted fascist squads in their armed suppression of organized socialism. Being combat trained, the fascist squads quickly defeated their opposition\u2014dismantling their communications and command structure. By 1922, there was no force on the peninsula that could resist fascism. The king called upon Mussolini to form a government. Populist fascism had come to Italy.\n\nOne need only compare the history of fascism with that of Trump\u2019s populism to recognize the irreducible differences that distinguish them. Mussolini\u2019s succession to power did not depend on the occasional votes of a transient constituency. Fascism did not seek the support of a population temporarily aggrieved by the political system. From its very founding in 1919, fascism was animated by convictions concerning the mass mobilization of a durable support base. Mussolini had early settled on combat veterans as his primary recruitment demographic. The fascist literature from the period survives and testifies to the fact.\n\nThe grievances of veterans were enduring\u2014and veterans were available in sufficient number to secure victory in popular elections. In defense of their fatherland, they had sacrificed everything. They had witnessed their comrades die in the service of a nation renewed. Fascist strategists recognized that the program to which fascism had committed itself by the time of its founding\u2014the economic and industrial development of the economically retrograde peninsula\u2014required protracted political control, social stability and comprehensive commitment. That demanded an enduring and inflexible platform of support. Fascists saw that support in the multitudinous combat veterans returning from the Great War. After the victory in the streets, the veteran combat squads who fought for the revolution were organized into a militia that became the armed guard of the Fascist National Party.\n\nThe populism sought by fascism was the arduous populism of developmental nationalism. They did not expect its instauration to be the consequence of an election. Given the presence of an established socialist opposition, they understood that violence would be essential to their success. Populisms predicated on developmental nationalism frequently acknowledge the role of violence in their establishment and success. The history of developmental populism in the Soviet Union, China, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Cuba, is sufficient to establish that.\n\nProviding the foundation for economic growth and industrialization\u2014constructing a suitable communications, transportation, and energy distribution network, as well as collecting the necessary human and financial capital for development in austere circumstances\u2014requires an entirely different set of policies compared to a program of reindustrializing an established system. Marshalling continued support for an entire program of national economic growth and industrial development would require the studied orchestration, or imposition, of compliance behavior. Within four years of coming to power, fascism dismantled the representative democracy of Savoyard Italy to introduce what would be an enduring single-party dictatorship.\n\nFor fascism, this was undertaken by inculcating the population with a set of public beliefs that took on the imperative qualities of a political religion. It was instilled where necessary by fear of potential punishment, and reinforced by the collective sentiment born of the wearing of uniforms and the sharing of symbols, together with the regular performance of ritual. Similar programmatic phenomena are recorded in many of the developmental populisms of the twentieth century. It has been seen in the Soviet Union of Josef Stalin, in Mao\u2019s China, and in Pol Pot\u2019s Kampuchea. There is none of that in Trump\u2019s populism\u2014and it would be ineffectual if attempted.\n\nThe distinction here is the distinction between the populism that arises in less developed, marginalized economic communities and those populisms that arise in industrialized (and essentially democratic) nations. The one involves enduring programs of mass mobilization, sacrificial labor, dedication, and obedience\u2014that often consume the lives of millions of innocents. The other involves winning episodic elections. Fascism is the paradigmatic instance of the first, Trump\u2019s populism is an incarnation of the second.\n\nOne need only read the fascist doctrinal literature of the period to recognize the source of the difference. Fascists aspired to totalitarian control of their demanding developmental environment for an anticipated period measured in decades. Trump\u2019s populism seeks to win the next election. Its time horizon is measured in months. Almost all its tangible effects will be transitory and almost entirely remediable by its successor. That anyone should find an instructive similarity between the two systems could only count as evidence of prejudgment.\n\nAs long as populism arises in industrialized, viable, representative democracies its overall effects are largely transitory. The populism in advanced industrial environments arises largely in reaction to the excesses of abundance. In the United States public immorality and the abandonment of decency is accompanied by the annual death of more Americans through street violence than the loss of American lives on the battlefields of the Middle East. Each year, together with the death of thousands of citizens through anarchic violence, hundreds of thousands of unborn infants perish through their voluntary abortion by their parents.\n\nLiberalism\u2019s narcissism and advocacy of individual self-indulgence, its anomic and amoral life style, its irreligiosity, and consequent anti-traditionalism\u2014all consequences of abundance\u2014together contribute to consequences that prompt political dissatisfaction among the more mature segments of the population. Such an environment precipitates the appearance of a charismatic to rally those politically disaffected and effectively disenfranchised. The result is the appearance of a \u201cconservative\u201d populist nationalism. Such reactions generally have some initial success, but they are predictably not enduring. Unless they can fundamentally alter the system, through some political alchemy, they will largely disappear with new elections.\n\nThere are communities of yet uncertain populism. Putin\u2019s Russia and Erdogan\u2019s Turkey are among them. They give evidence of a populist nationalism as yet not fully articulated. The properties of such systems vary as circumstances change. Their future remains obscure. Putin\u2019s Russia seems scheduled to run a course of an anomalous developmental nationalism.\n\nThe differences between the populisms here considered are manifest. Those that appear in established and viable representative democracies are far different from those\u2014like Putin\u2019s Russia\u2014that manifest themselves in industrialized but essentially nondemocratic environments. Many of the non-socialist populisms that surface in economies only marginally developed are distinctive. The populism that arose in Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore have been distinctive. Their developmental nationalism has been characteristically protracted, authoritarian, and essentially supportive of traditional values. Their populations are industrious, frugal, obedient, demonstrably moral, and overtly nationalist. Generally animated by a set of relatively formal convictions that render them compliant, they often provide the platform for what becomes a time conditioned, essentially one-party governance.\n\nThe variants of socialist developmental populism (and Mussolini\u2019s Fascism was one such variant) constitute a distinctive subset. Some of the consequences of the populism of a socialist oriented, developmental nationalism can be observed in the behaviors of the People\u2019s Republic of China. After a century, China is nearing the end of its developmental cycle. Its one-party state and its political religion remain fully intact. It has its charismatic life-time president.\n\nWithin the next two dozen years China may well surpass the productive capacity of the United States. Its armed forces are growing with impressive rapidity. It poses a threat to United States dominance in the West Pacific and to the freedom of navigation through the choke points in the South China Sea. Its irredentist shadow falls across Japan, Taiwan, and the nations of Southeast Asia. In effect, like fascism, China is a classic instance of a \u201csocialist,\u201d nationalist developmental populism. The Chinese regularly remind us of the time when China was the Central Kingdom\u2014the critical center of civilization. All of that suggests that rather than the imagined fascism of Trump\u2019s populism\u2014it is the populism of China that should occupy our serious attention.\n\nProfessor A.

One moment the capricious president takes an intransigent attitude, and the next he shows an intention to negotiate. Trump even accused China of attempting to \u201cmeddle\u201d in the midterm elections, saying that \u201cthey don\u2019t want me or us to win because I am the first president to ever challenge China on trade.\u201d The midterm elections this time have caused so much chaos. As a country that always sets standards for democracy, how come the US is so divided today? Seldom has it been so hard for its society to reach consensus. Just look at the recent cases: A Trump supporter sent bomb devices to 14 opponents and a gunman who reportedly wanted all Jews to die gunned down 11 at a Pittsburgh synagogue. The political antagonism and anxiety in US society has been escalating, and the spirit of compromise is all gone. The US elections are becoming less and less civilized and the two parties\u2019 key politicians are sparing no efforts in the election campaign to smear their opponents instead of building consensus.\n\n\u201cThe 2018 midterms won\u2019t fix this divisiveness,\u201d the Global Times predicted, placing what seems like a safe bet.\n\n\u201cNo matter which party wins, the two parties\u2019 politicians will always incite antagonism with each other.

Chinese officials saw Trump as a businessman with whom they could negotiate and who could be easily flattered. Things have not turned out as Beijing expected. This year, Trump launched a massive trade war against China, imposing tariffs on roughly $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, prompting businesses to begin to move supply chains elsewhere in Asia. China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs have taken aim at products from largely Republican states.

D\u00edaz-Canel had visited North Korea in the past as vice president and met with senior North Korean officials on multiple occasions this year.\n\nThe coverage in the communist state media of both countries emphasized the friendly rapport between the two men. Granma, the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, reported on Sunday that D\u00edaz-Canel and his entourage had left the last stop on his Asia tour, Russia, \u201coverflowing with emotions\u201d about returning to North Korea. Upon arrival, D\u00edaz-Canel reportedly received \u201call the military honors corresponding to his high status from Kim Jong-un.\u201d\n\nKim personally greeted D\u00edaz-Canel at the airport and the two conducted a tour of Pyongyang via parade, welcomed by throngs of cheering North Koreans who face severe retribution if they are insufficiently enthusiastic at government events. \u201cThousands of people waved flowers, flags, and balloons, and the message of Pyongyang and Havana was perfectly intelligible,\u201d Granma proclaimed.\n\nGranma does not detail any policy discussions between the North Korean leader and Castro\u2019s representative. The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), North Korea\u2019s official news service, did report that D\u00edaz-Canel applauded North Korea for \u201cinvariably advancing along the road chosen by themselves and making a rapid development under the leadership of Kim Jong Un.\u201d\n\nThe two sides reportedly also discussed expansions in trade and scientific development. \u201cKim and Diaz-Canel discussed the issue of further expanding and developing cooperation and exchanges in various fields, including the economy, culture, public health, science and technology,\u201d KCNA reported.\n\nKim and D\u00edaz-Canel engaged in political talks behind closed doors before attending an artistic event held in the Cuban representatives\u2019 honor. According to Granma, D\u00edaz-Canel was treated to \u201ca beautiful spectacle\u201d in Pyongyang including North Korean local artists\u2019 performances of Cuban communist anthems and the classic Cuban folk song \u201cGuantanamera.\u201d\n\nKCNA reports similarly that D\u00edaz-Canel also attended a \u201cgrand banquet\u201d where Kim Jong-un regaled him with compliments.\n\nKim \u201csaid that the meeting with the Cuban president marked a watershed in demonstrating the will to carry forward forever the friendship between the two countries,\u201d according to KCNA. \u201cSaying that the two countries are in the same trench in the struggle for defending sovereignty and dignity of their countries and safeguarding international justice, he expressed invariable support and encouragement to the Cuban people building a powerful and prosperous country.\u201d\n\nD\u00edaz-Canel responded by noting that his visit occurred \u201cat a historic period of inheriting the cause of the revolution in Cuba \u2026 an evident sign of the fixed stand of the Cuban party and government to invariably develop the relations with the DPRK.\u201d\n\nThe visit arrives amid the strongest sanctions ever imposed on North Korea internationally and the beginning of a new round of nuclear disarmament talks between North Korea and the United States. Cuba has proven a useful ally to North Korea at the United Nations and other global forums and itself has taken on an emboldened attitude towards America and repression of its own people in light of economic and political concessions made in 2014 by the Obama administration.\n\nNorth Korea most recently sent its vice chairman of the Central Committee of the North\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party Choe Ryong-hae to Cuba in August to discuss political cooperation. At the time, experts speculated that North Korea would recruit Cuba to pressure the Trump administration, which has begun the process of overturning Obama-era policies towards the Castro regime, to support a reduction in sanctions on Pyongyang.\n\nPrior to Choe\u2019s visit, a coalition of other senior figures arrived in Havana in July, the first such visit since Castro handed the title of \u201cpresident\u201d to D\u00edaz-Canel. Castro remains the head of the Communist Party and the Cuban military, however, making him the most powerful man in Cuba.\n\nD\u00edaz-Canel has already visited China and Russia on his current trip to Asia and is expected to follow his visit to North Korea with stops in Laos and Vietnam. All the countries on his itinerary except for Russia are officially communist countries.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "The Dominican Republic opened in its new embassy in Beijing this weekend following its decision to no longer recognize Taiwan as an independent country.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Dominican President Danilo Medina were present at the opening ceremony on Saturday to mark the increasingly close relations between the two countries, facilitated by the island nation choosing to break diplomatic ties with Taiwan in May in exchange for a $3 billion investment and a generous loan package.\n\nAccording to a report from Chinese state propaganda outlet Global Times, Wang affirmed that China is \u201cready to work with the Dominican Republic to promote bilateral cooperation in various fields following the political guidance of the two countries\u2019 leaders, so as to make greater contributions to the common development and shared prosperity of the nations and their two peoples.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe move will build a bridge of friendship linking the political center of the two countries, and open a new window of mutual understanding between the two peoples.\u201d\n\nDominican Foreign Minister Miguel Vargason affirmed that his government\u2019s choice to establish diplomatic ties with China was a \u201cwise choice\u201d that represented a \u201chistorical moment in the Dominican Republic\u2019s foreign relations.\u201d\n\nThe move has received substantial criticism. An editorial in the Dominican newspaper El Nacional accused the government of signing a host of secret agreements in exchange for investment without fully informing the public as to their potential consequences.\n\n\u201cPoliticians, legislators, business leaders and civil society demand transparency in the signing of these agreements and call on the President to explain the real scope of these commitments, some of which advance objections without knowing their content yet,\u201d the editorial reads.\n\nA piece in the Listin Diario, the Dominican Republic\u2019s most prominent newspaper, makes the case that the move is unconstitutional, as China\u2019s increased influence over the country will undermine the \u201cindependence and sovereignty of the foreign policy of the Dominican Republic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis single declaration by the President compromises the independence and sovereignty of the foreign policy of the Dominican Republic,\u201d wrote journalist Vinicio Castillo Sem\u00e1n.\n\n\u201cThe Dominican Republic is a sovereign State and can not, therefore, in one of the fundamental attributions as an organized State, sign an agreement by which it has to \u2018consult politically\u2019 with any foreign power what is or will be its actions in multilateral forums,\u201d he continued.\n\nChina has expanded its attempts to influence Latin America, where it uses economic and financial power to forge predatory relationships with some of the continent\u2019s most impoverished nations.\n\nLast week, Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping also welcomed Salvadorian President Salvador S\u00e1nchez Ceren to Beijing with a military ceremony at the Great Hall of the People after El Salvador announced they would switch their allegiance from Taiwan to China this year.\n\nAs a reward, China has pledged increased investment in the Central American country, as well as funding for education, health, and drought relief. However, Xi warned that having forged such a relationship, El Salvador \u201chas to stick to the one-China principle, which is the foundation of China-El Salvador relations, to build a more solid base for bilateral relations.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "Investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson writes in the Hill that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been using its surveillance on American citizens \u201cfor the better part of two decades, if not longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe you once thought the CIA wasn\u2019t supposed to spy on Americans here in the United States,\u201d said the Emmy-winning investigative journalist. \u201cThat concept is so yesteryear.\u201d She points to newly declassified 2014 documents which \u201creveal the CIA not only intercepted emails of U.S. citizens, but they were emails of the most sensitive kind,\u201d namely about whistleblowers:\n\nThe disclosures, kept secret until now, are two letters of \u201ccongressional notification\u201d from the Intelligence Community inspector general at the time, Charles McCullough. He stated that during \u201croutine counterintelligence monitoring of government computer systems,\u201d the CIA collected emails between congressional staff and the CIA\u2019s head of whistleblowing and source protection.\n\nMcCullough was concerned about the \u201cpotential compromise to whistleblower confidentiality, and the consequent \u2018chilling effect\u2019 that the present [counterintelligence] monitoring system might have on Intelligence Community whistleblowing.\u201d\n\nWhile the CIA is supposedly restricted to spying on individuals \u201conly for an authorized intelligence purpose\u201d such as when someone is suspected of terrorism, they have also given themselves carte blanche to perform \u201croutine counterintelligence monitoring of government computers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only reason we know any of this now is thanks to Sen. Chuck Grassley,\u201d Attkisson said. Grassley pursued these \u201ccongressional notifications\u201d for years while his staff was being spied on\u2013 but both the Obama and Trump administrations have made it exceedingly difficult to get at the information therein. The surveillance information was finally declassified by the new Intelligence Community Inspector General, Michael Atkinson.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the CIA under the Obama administration was reading congressional staff\u2019s emails about Intelligence Community whistleblowers raises serious policy concerns, as well as potential constitutional separation-of-powers issues that must be discussed publicly,\u201d Grassley wrote in a statement.\n\nAttkisson concludes with a rebuke of American complacency, saying:\n\nBut today, we\u2019ve grown numb. Outrage has been replaced by a cynical, \u201cWho\u2019s surprised about that?\u201d or the persistent belief that \u201cNothing\u2019s really going to be done about it,\u201d and, worst of all, \u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about it, anyway?\u201d\n\nShe pointed to the FBI\u2019s bald-faced attempts to stop President Trump from being elected as a symptom of a broader concern; that \u201cbad actors targeting candidate Donald Trump and his associates\u201d in order to keep people from learning that \u201cour Intelligence Community [has been] increasingly spying on its own citizens, journalists, members of Congress and political enemies for the better part of two decades, if not longer.\u201d", "Hollywood celebrities revved up their social media sniveling in the waning hours before the highly anticipated midterm elections.

Some students and an adult in the room attempted to break up the fight.\n\n\u201cIt was just back and forth, back and forth, and then the teacher just decided to throw a punch and that\u2019s when everything happened,\u201d the student said.\n\nThe student was transported to a local hospital, where he was treated for minor injuries.\n\nCBS Los Angeles reported that Riley was taken into custody at the Los Angeles County Jail, where he was held on $50,000 bond before being released on bond.\n\nSome students stuck up for Riley despite the charges against him.\n\n\u201cI had this teacher before and I had no problem with him,\u201d one student told KTLA. \u201cHe was a really nice teacher, I always respected him. He always had a really good relationship with every student.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department said the investigation into the case was being transferred to the special victims\u2019 bureau.\n\nThe Los Angeles Unified School District told KABC they were cooperating with authorities, but could not comment further because it was a personnel matter.\n\nMaywood Academy High School\u2019s principal said counselors would be available to the students on Monday in light of the incident.", "Social media bots helped failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton more than President Trump during the 2016 presidential election, according to a paper from an MIT associate professor.\n\nIn a paper, Monday, Tauhid Zaman, an associate professor of operations management at the MIT Sloan School of Management, revealed that \u201cTrump bots were far less effective at shifting people\u2019s opinions than the smaller proportion of bots backing Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven much of the news reporting, we were expecting the bots to help Trump \u2013 but they didn\u2019t. In a network without bots, the average human user had a pro-Clinton score of 42 out of 100. With the bots, though, we had found the average human had a pro-Clinton score of 58,\u201d Zaman declared. \u201cThat shift was a far larger effect than we had anticipated, given how few and unconnected the bots were. The network structure had amplified the bots\u2019 power.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wondered what had made the Clinton bots more effective than the Trump bots. Closer inspection showed that the 260 bots supporting Trump posted a combined 113,498 tweets, or 437 tweets per bot. However, the 150 bots supporting Clinton posted 96,298 tweets, or 708 tweets per bot,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt appeared that the power of the Clinton bots came not from their numbers, but from how often they tweeted. We found that most of what the bots posted were retweets of the candidates or other influential individuals. So they were not really crafting original tweets, but sharing existing ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cA small number of very active bots can actually significantly shift public opinion,\u201d Zaman concluded.\n\nIn 2015, an audit of Clinton\u2019s Twitter account from the Washington Examiner revealed that she had the most fake followers out of all of the 2016 presidential election candidates.", "A Yahoo News report published on Friday quoted several former U.S. intelligence officials who said the covert Internet system employed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to communicate with intel sources worldwide suffered a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d compromise between 2009 and 2013.\n\nThe sources claimed the compromise was linked to Iran\u2019s vengeful hunt for American spies after the discovery of a secret underground uranium enrichment plant.\n\nAccording to Yahoo\u2019s narrative, the CIA communications disaster began in 2009 after Iran was caught enriching uranium at an underground facility kept secret from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The event was deeply embarrassing for Tehran and began a sequence of events that ended with tough sanctions imposed against Iran\u2019s nuclear program until they were lifted by then-President Barack Obama\u2019s nuclear deal in 2015.\n\nIran launched an intensive \u201cmole hunt\u201d and discovered the CIA relied excessively upon a flawed and \u201celementary\u201d covert communications system that proved relatively easy to crack. According to Yahoo\u2019s sources, American officials found the covert Internet system easy to use, so they were reluctant to change it and they greatly overestimated how secure it was.\n\nOver the course of the next year, Iran exposed dozens of CIA sources, imprisoning and executing many of them in what a former intelligence official described as an \u201cincredibly damaging\u201d vendetta against American informants. The Iranians reportedly \u201ccultivated a double agent who led them to the secret CIA communications system,\u201d which was used in many other \u201cdifficult operational environments.\u201d\n\nAccording to Yahoo News, CIA officials were stunned at how quickly and thoroughly the Iranians penetrated the system, which relied on phony corporate websites. One of the report\u2019s cringe-inducing details is that once the Iranian double agent pointed out a disguised CIA website, Iranian intelligence unraveled the rest of the CIA network using Google searches for similar sites and monitoring traffic to those websites.\n\nThis was quickly followed by China\u2019s catastrophic compromise of America\u2019s spy network in 2011 and 2012, which culminated in the arrest and execution of about 30 U.S. agents and sources, essentially destroying the American network in China.\n\nAccording to Yahoo\u2019s sources, the Chinese penetrated the same CIA internet system uncovered by Iran, and may possibly have consulted with Iranian intelligence or made use of information passed by Iran to Russia, which was engaged in some \u201cvery suspicious\u201d collusion on cyber-espionage at the time. Some other analysts have speculated China cracked the CIA network on its own and passed the information along to Russia.\n\nYahoo reported on Friday there is evidence Iran, Russia, and China have been working together on cyber-espionage against the United States and might have compromised American intelligence operations around the world:\n\nThere were discrete signs of potential cooperation. Around the time of the purges of CIA informants in Iran and China, senior counter-espionage officials from China\u2019s Ministry of State Security visited their counterparts in Tehran, said four former U.S. officials. Some officials believe the two countries engaged in a trade \u2014 perhaps with Iran providing China with the technical information needed to pinpoint signs of online activity on the communications system, in exchange for military hardware, speculated one former official. \u201cThat\u2019s the spy service way,\u201d said another former official. With dawning horror, U.S. officials realized that once Iranian or Chinese intelligence officials were able to pinpoint CIA assets within their own borders, they were almost certainly capable of zeroing in on similar digital signatures in other countries, former officials said. Former officials said the fallout from the compromises was likely global in scope \u2014 potentially endangering all CIA sources that used some version of this internet-based system worldwide.\n\nThe thrust of the Yahoo report is that Iranian penetration of CIA networks across the Middle East is much worse than previously admitted by U.S. officials, and the response from the Obama administration was agonizingly slow, hindered by politics, bureaucracy, and the inherent difficulty of making huge adjustments to covert networks without alerting adversaries. The near-total lack of accountability for anyone involved in creating this disaster is said to have dismayed whistleblowers.\n\n\u201cWhen we continuously allow things like this to happen, and Congress doesn\u2019t do anything, and the institutions don\u2019t do anything, you\u2019re going to have worse issues,\u201d said a former intelligence official.\n\n\u201cPeople will say, \u2018I went to the inspector general and it didn\u2019t work; I went elsewhere and it didn\u2019t \u201cwork.\u2019 People will see it as a game. It will lead to corruption, and it will lead to espionage. When people see that the system is corrupt, it affects everything,\u201d the official added.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still dealing with the fallout,\u201d said a former national security official. \u201cDozens of people around the world were killed because of this.\u201d\n\nIn a possibly related development, Iran recently complained about its \u201cinfrastructure and strategic networks\u201d coming under attack from a \u201cmore violent, more advanced, and more sophisticated\u201d version of the Stuxnet virus, widely seen as a successful U.S. and/or Israeli cyber attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear program in 2010. The Iranians claim they were largely able to repel the new virus attack.", "A group of students at the University of Notre Dame is demanding a filter that would block porn access on the campus internet service.\n\n1,000 faculty, students, and staff at the University of Notre Dame are demanding a filter for the campus\u2019 internet service that would effectively block access to pornography.\n\nIn an open letter that was published online, a group of students argued that allowing students on campus to access internet porn is a violation of the \u201csocial justice\u201d principles that the school espouses.\n\nAs a university that champions social justice, human rights, equality and dignity, Notre Dame ought to block pornography using the technology available to us. Doing so represents both an attempt to eradicate pornography from the campus culture and, more broadly, a strong stance against sexual assault, sex trafficking and other human rights violations. We have come to expect our school to be a driving force for cultural change in our nation, and pornography is a cultural issue that needs changing.\n\nThe letter also addresses the number of Notre Dame students that watch pornography on the campus\u2019 internet service. According to a survey conducted in 2013, over half of male Notre Dame students have watched porn on the campus network. Almost one-fifth of female students have also viewed pornography on the campus network.\n\nPornography does not come up often in casual conversation, but its effects are everywhere \u2014 even on the campus we call home. A survey conducted in 2013 showed that 63 percent of male Notre Dame students have viewed pornography on the university Wi-Fi network. National studies have demonstrated 64 percent of college men and 18 percent of college women spend time viewing online porn each week. In a given month, 86 percent of men interact with pornography.\n\nThe letter points out that the university already prohibits the viewing of pornography on the campus internet service. However, the rule is not enforced, likely due to the privacy invasions that would be required to identify violators.\n\nIn the face of the massive violation of human dignity perpetuated by pornography production and consumption, many organizations worldwide have taken the simple, positive step of internet filtering. Unfortunately, Notre Dame has yet to take this step. The Notre Dame Internet Compliance Policy prohibits the access of pornographic material, but the University has not enforced this policy.\n\nNotre Dame has not yet responded to the letter.", "Authorities arrested an Oklahoma City man for taking suspicious photos at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and threatening to set off an explosion to kill hundreds of people at the site, police said.\n\nKOCO reported Monday that the suspect, Amiremad Nayebyazdi, allegedly called his sister living in Iran to say that \u201chundreds of people are going to die in Oklahoma City, and something very large is going to happen.\u201d\n\nA concerned person in California told police on November 1 that Nayebyazdi left his sister a recorded voice message, which the caller \u201cloosely translated\u201d:\n\n\u201cHundreds are going to die in Oklahoma City, something very large is going to happen, it will be on the news, and don\u2019t tell mom and dad until it is seen on the news,\u201d the message reportedly said, according to the caller.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Force contacted Oklahoma City Police on October 30 about a man taking suspicious photos at the memorial.\n\nThe person, later identified as Nayebyazdi, had been spotted taking photos of the memorial at unusual angles and in odd spots on multiple occasions, officials said.\n\nSecurity forces were able to locate the suspect after tracking down the man\u2019s visitor tag number, which the memorial issued when he visited the site.\n\nA team of police officers, FBI agents, and a bomb squad had been dispatched to the suspect\u2019s home in Oklahoma City, where they found no explosive devices. They spoke to Nayebyazdi, who told authorities he \u201chears things\u201d and told his sister the explosion was going to take place.\n\nPolice said Nayebyazdi told them he did not make explosive devices, but he did admit to taking the suspicious photos. Authorities then arrested Nayebyazdi for threatening to kill by use of explosive and transported him to a hospital for a mental health evaluation.\n\nThe Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum, created to honor those killed in the 1995 bombing of a federal building in downtown Oklahoma City, released a statement, in part thanking authorities for their \u201cvigilance\u201d in apprehending the suspect.\n\n\u201cAs you can imagine, we live and work in a heightened state of awareness and security at the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum, primarily because of the incident in 1995 and premise for which the Memorial and Museum were even built,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\n\u201cI am very proud of our staff, NPS Rangers and the Memorial Security team for their vigilant work and for being aware of unusual circumstances and working with local law enforcement teams,\u201d the statement continued.", "MoveOn, a George Soros-funded anti-Republican PAC, was allegedly the biggest political Facebook advertisement spender last week \u2014 the final week before the midterm elections.\n\nMoveOn\u2019s Washington Director, Ben Wikler, bragged about the PAC\u2019s advertisement budget, along with its \u201csecret weapon\u201d against the Republican Party, which consisted of using hundreds of videos of voters explaining why they\u2019re voting Democrat.\n\nNEW: Nationwide, @MoveOn was the biggest spender on political ads on Facebook last week. Today, we're pulling back the curtains on this election's \"secret weapon\": a groundbreaking new way to do digital ads that leapfrogs the GOP's political tech. THREAD. https://t.co/lhpoLDhANm \u2014 Ben Wikler (@benwikler) November 5, 2018\n\n\u201cNationwide, @MoveOn was the biggest spender on political ads on Facebook last week,\u201d declared Wikler on Twitter, Monday. \u201cToday, we\u2019re pulling back the curtains on this election\u2019s \u2018secret weapon\u2019: a groundbreaking new way to do digital ads that leapfrogs the GOP\u2019s political tech.\u201d\n\n\u201cTraditional political advertising works like this: campaigns run polls to see what voters care about. They choose a message. They spend ~$10k-30k to shoot & edit. If they\u2019re smart, they test them, often via dial-test or focus groups. Then they pay to put them online & on TV,\u201d continued Wikler. \u201cThis year, MoveOn turned that model on its head. We started by asking real voters in key races why they\u2019re supporting their Democratic candidates. We collected more than 2500 authentic, unscripted videos\u2014people talking into their phones.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe used a new, rapid, low-cost, and highly accurate technique to test whether the ads moved people. Classic scientific experiment, with randomized treatment and control groups. We found 260 videos that worked as extraordinarily persuasive political ads,\u201d he proclaimed, adding, \u201cWe used Facebook\u2019s targeting technology to run the 260 ads to people matching the specific folks who found them persuasive in our tests, across 89 House races, 10 Senate races, and 10 governors\u2019 races. In all, we\u2019re reaching more than 20 million potential voters in key areas.\u201d\n\nWikler then declared that the advertisements \u201cdon\u2019t look slick. They look real. Because they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat might help explain their impact. Or maybe it\u2019s the topics people talked about\u2014not stuff brainstormed on a consultant\u2019s whiteboard, just actual people speaking from the heart\u2026 Regardless of exactly why, the most striking thing about this program: it actually *works* to move votes,\u201d Wikler concluded. \u201cWhich is, unfortunately, a very rare thing in politics.\u201d\n\nOn its official website, MoveOn, which is financially backed by socialist billionaire George Soros, explains its goal is to \u201cend Republican control of Congress,\u201d and promote a \u201cprogressive future,\u201d and the PAC frequently uses the hashtag #ResistAndWin.", "It is the most effective tool that the Democrat-media complex has.\n\n\u2013 Andrew Breitbart\n\nLong before the Trump presidency, and long before the Resistance, Andrew Breitbart understood that left\u2019s use of the race card was a simply a tactic and effective one at that.\n\nNow, with the midterms upon us, an unhinged media and an unhinged Hollywood are employing that same tactic with an unparalleled fervor, casting aspersions on any and every deplorable.\n\nIt\u2019s a playbook and it\u2019s nothing new.\n\nThe interview above was taken from the movie Runaway Slave.\n\nIt was released in January of 2012.\n\nBelow is the transcript.", "Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA), a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told Breitbart News Sunday that his Democratic opponent, George Scott, showed \u201chorrific lapse in judgment\u201d by jokingly pointing a gun at the head of a soldier.\n\nDemocrat Scott\u2019s campaign struck controversy over the weekend when a photo, taken in 1989 or 1990, showed Scott pointing a gun at the head of a soldier to produce what was \u201cintended as a comic image.\u201d\n\nTalk radio host and Rush Limbaugh guest host Ken Matthews slammed the Pennsylvania Democrat in a post on Facebook, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want this guy anywhere near our U.S. Congress.\u201d\n\nOne observer noted, \u201cAlthough Scott claimed that his finger was not on the trigger, Williams observed, \u201cMy fellow gunners\u2026.note his finger on the trigger and the lack of respect for his rank and uniform.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Sunday host Amanda House described the picture as \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\n\nCongressman Perry slammed his Democratic opponent, claiming that the picture revealed that Scott had a \u201chorrific lapse in judgment.\u201d\n\nPerry said, \u201cThere\u2019s just no reasonable explanation, and of course it\u2019s a horrific lapse in judgment. He said, \u2018well the gun wasn\u2019t loaded,\u2019 or there\u2019s the question whether his finger was on the trigger and it clearly looks like it is on the photograph, but there\u2019s absolutely there no reason to do something like that.\u201d\n\nRep. Perry continued, \u201cThis is a job interview essentially for one of the most important positions in our country, and you just have to say to yourself if you saw that photo, would you hire that person to work in your country, would you hire this person to babysit your children, or would you question their judgment?\u201d\n\nPerry faces a competitive race against Scott in the competitive tenth congressional district of Pennsylvania. A recent New York Times poll had Perry leading Scott by two points.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s important that the people in this district are made aware of that and consider the consequences of that as well. This is the same person that says he fully supports the Second Amendment, in his primary race he took a firearm and dismantled threw it on the fire,\u201d the Pennsylvania conservative explained. \u201cNow, he said it was a weapon of war, like the kind that\u2019s used by the United States military but actually it was a .22 [caliber] rifle that you would teach your children or the Boy Scouts.\u201d\n\nPerry charged, \u201cHe not only will appear to do anything at all to win but he\u2019s been very disingenuous to mislead and fabricate the facts.\u201d\n\nThe Pennsylvania Republican concluded, \u201cI will tell you having from my perspective having spent a little time in Washington, DC, we don\u2019t need another politician that will say one thing at home and do another thing in Washington, DC.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Sunday airs on SiriusXM Patriot125 from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Eastern.", "Brad Parscale, 2020 campaign manager for President Trump, unloaded on NBC News and Facebook for removing a campaign advertisement about the migrant caravan heading to the U.S.-Mexico border just one day before the midterm election.

This means, even for residents who lack a criminal record and are legally able to buy a firearm, the local sheriff has the discretion to refrain from approving their permit application unless they demonstrate \u201cgood cause\u201d for carrying a firearm.\n\nRothery\u2019s petition for certiorari noted these things, punctuating what they believed to be an arbitrary application of the permitting process:\n\nThere are no uniform state standards for the issuance of a permit; leaving the decision entirely within the discretion of the locally elected sheriff. The discretionary and arbitrary application process itself creates perverse incentives for the approval or denial of an application. Most individuals in many California counties, including Sacramento County, cannot obtain a permit to carry a concealed weapon unless the individual is a friend or campaign contributor to the local county sheriff. Honorably retired California peace officers are exempted from this restraint as they are automatically granted a lifetime right to carry concealed weapons, regardless of need or merit.\n\nRothery was dismissed by a district court, then appealed to the Ninth Circuit, where the dismissal was affirmed. The case was then appealed to Supreme Court, where it was docketed on July 27. On November 5, the Court announced it would not hear the case.\n\n\u201cIt is never any reflection on the legal merits when the Supreme Court declines to take a case,\u201d explains Breitbart News Senior Legal Editor Ken Klukowski. \u201cThis petition was poorly written, making this case an unsuitable vehicle for the Supreme Court to take up such an important constitutional issue as Second Amendment rights outside the home.\u201d\n\nThe case is Rothery v.

The poll was conducted in the second half of October.\n\nNot surprisingly, Republican farmers are far more supportive than Democrat farmers. Ninety-two percent of the GOP farmers approved of the way Trump is handling the presidency, compared to 33 percent of the Democrats and 65 percent of the independents, according to Argri-Pulse.\n\nThose numbers are a deep disappointment for Democrats who had hoped that the pushback from China on Trump\u2019s trade policies, including China\u2019s steep tariff on U.S. grown soybeans, would convince farmers to turn blue in the midterm elections. Soybean prices have fallen to their lowest levels in a decade, largely due to China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs.\n\n\u201cWhen asked which political party relates to you and your farming interests, 65 percent said it was the GOP compared to only 9 percent who selected Democrats,\u201d Agri-Pulse said.", "Monday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAndrea Mitchell Reports,\u201d former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett attributed the current strong economy to the effort of former President Barack Obama.\n\nWhen asked about the \u201cfairly strong\u201d economy, Jarrett said, \u201cA lot of the benefits of our economy began a while ago when President Obama was in office. We\u2019re heartened to see the progress we\u2019re making. I also traveled around the country, and I talked to Americans who are still very concerned about what\u2019s happening in their pocketbook. I think the economy isn\u2019t the only issue. The other thing I hear front and center is health care. So many Americans are worried about the Republicans\u2019 plan to take away their health care and make it unaffordable for them. They won\u2019t be able to cover people who have pre-existing conditions. I hear that. People are worried about our values when we start taking families and tearing them apart on the border or threatening to shoot people who are using stones and walking away from a climate deal where we\u2019re worried about our next generation and whether or not our children or grandchildren are going to live in a world where they don\u2019t have to worry about climate change.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThere\u2019s so many important issues that I\u2019m hearing about; a woman\u2019s right to choose, that\u2019s front and center. You heard on your earlier panel about how important it is for women to get involved in this election. They\u2019re showing up in record numbers. We still have one more day.

During the most recent month, that number jumped to nearly 1,400.\n\nDuring Fiscal Year 2018 (which ended on September 30), U.S. Border Patrol agents assigned to the nine southwest border sectors apprehended an average of nearly 1,100 migrants per day. Of those, approximately 430 were listed as unaccompanied minors or family units, according to the Fiscal Year 2018 Southwest Border Migration Report from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\n\nBorder Patrol agents apprehended 396,579 illegal immigrants who crossed the border between ports of entry during the most recent fiscal year. This represents an average of 1,087 per day. Included in that number were 50,036 Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) \u2014 137 per day \u2014 and 107,212 Family Unit Aliens (FMUA) \u2014 293.73 per day \u2014 officials reported.\n\nThose numbers increased substantially during the final six months of the fiscal year.

It averaged more than 40 percent of all border apprehensions in the nine southwest border sectors. The RGV Sector averaged about 445 migrant apprehensions per day, the report reveals (162,262 total). The sector reported apprehensions of nearly 60 percent (63,278) of all of the 107,212 FMUA apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico Border. It also accounted for nearly 50 percent (23,757) of all unaccompanied minor apprehensions. On average the RGV sector apprehended an average of more than 170 family units and 65 unaccompanied minors per day.\n\nIn response to the drastically rising numbers, the Border Patrol officials announced the awarding of a contract to build new sections of border fencing in the Rio Grande Valley Sector beginning in February 2019, Breitbart News reported.\n\nThe numbers listed above are expected to increase sharply as migrant caravans from Central America approach the U.S. southern border.

China, in turn, offered funding for development projects that would greatly benefit China in exchange for a greater foothold in the countries in question.\n\nThe policies outlined in Xi\u2019s speech are an extension of the global infrastructure project known as One Belt, One Road (OBOR) or the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which seeks to make China the builder and controller of the world\u2019s most important ports, roads, and railways.\n\nThe state-run Global Times publication ran Xi\u2019s full speech on Monday.\n\n\u201cPeople with vision in the world would agree that economic globalization, as an irreversible trend of history, has greatly boosted global growth,\u201d Xi told attendees. \u201cThis is an overarching trend, something that is independent of people\u2019s will. What we mankind can do is to understand, adapt to, and apply the law of history instead of trying to prevent it from happening. The wheel of history, indeed, will keep rolling forward no matter what.\u201d\n\nXi insisted that all nations must \u201copen wider and expand the space for mutually beneficial cooperation,\u201d arguing that \u201cseclusion leads to backwardsness.\u201d He appeared to reference ongoing trade talks with the United States without mentioning America by name, arguing, \u201cbeggaring thy neighbor, isolation and seclusion will only result in trade stagnation and an unhealthy world economy.\u201d\n\nOn the contrary, Xi argued, \u201cefforts to reduce tariff barriers\u201d would bring greater prosperity. \u201cCountries need to pursue an open policy, explicitly oppose protectionism and unilateralism, and strive to enhance the level of opening-up at both multilateral and bilateral levels,\u201d he added.\n\nXi repeatedly stated that globalization, while allegedly inevitable, was \u201cunder threat\u201d of unspecified forces of \u201cprotectionism and unilateralism.\u201d He addressed these by issuing specific proposals China will adopt to make globalization more accessible to more of the world.\n\nThe BRI was, of course, on top of this list. \u201cChina will continue to advance the Belt and Road Initiative through international cooperation in the spirit of consultation and collaboration for shared benefits,\u201d Xi vowed. \u201cWe will work with the participating countries on major projects, set up more trade promotion platforms and encourage more well-established and capable Chinese companies to invest in countries along the routes.\u201d\n\nThe BRI/OBOR projects have largely brought legal chaos, hardship, and, in some cases, racial animus to the countries cooperating with China. Countries like Sri Lanka and Djibouti have accepted Chinese control over ports and other BRI projects, while workers in African countries complain that a surge of imported Chinese workers have eliminated job opportunities for locals. In Kenya, workers have accused China of imposing an \u201capartheid\u201d system where domestic workers are kept out of skilled labor jobs and banned from suing the same buses, cafeterias, and equipment as the Chinese immigrants.\n\nKenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta was among the heads of state attending the international expo despite widespread opposition to the spread of BRI in the country.\n\nIn addition to the Belt and Road projects, Xi told his audience on Monday that China also planned to implement a system to rank businesses and investors and punish any businesses that the Chinese Communist Party deemed in opposition to its interests.\n\n\u201cWe will implement, across the board, the management system based on pre-establishment national treatment and negative list,\u201d Xi said. \u201cWe respect international business rules and practice, and provide equal treatment to all types of businesses registered in China.\u201d\n\nXi concluded comparing the Chinese economy to an ocean, telling the crowd, \u201cBig winds and storms may upset a pond, but never an ocean. Having experienced numerous winds and storms, the ocean will still be there! It is the same for China.\u201d\n\nAmong the world leaders leaving China with new trade deals are the president of El Salvador, the prime minister of Pakistan, and Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, the subordinate to Cuban dictator Ra\u00fal Castro. Xi\u2019s ocean metaphor appeared to be an attempt to calm these and other world leaders on the steep decline in the national economy\u2019s health in light of the imposition of tariffs on behalf of the Trump administration.\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index saw its value fall to its lowest level in four years last month, and the Chinese economy generally expanded in 2018 at the slowest rate in modern history since 2009.

If you have not voted already, it is critical. The hard left is going to show up in massive numbers, so if you want to preserve freedom in Texas, come out and vote on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nHouse invited Cruz\u2019s comments about a recently published undercover video from Project Veritas of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign staffers discussing the use of campaign resources to assist Central and South America migrant caravans seeking entry to the United States.\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\n\nCruz said, \u201cI think these videos show just how radical and extreme Beto O\u2019Rourke is on immigration. He supports open borders. He has said he is, quote, open to abolishing ICE. He supports sanctuary cities. He opposes Kate\u2019s Law; as you know, I\u2019m the author of Kate\u2019s Law in the Senate.\n\nCruz added, \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke has carefully avoided saying anything about the caravan. The reporters who travel with him are like this gentle cocoon who wrap their arms around and protect him. \u2026 [He believes] all ten thousand of these people marching in the caravan should be allowed to march into Texas, should be allowed to march in and cross the border illegally. If he said that publicly, he knows that is inconsistent with the views and values of Texans.\u201d\n\nCruz continued, \u201cHis campaign staffers, their priority is helping people coming illegally to this country, rather than standing up for the rule of law and standing up for the people of Texas.\u201d\n\nCruz remarked, \u201c[Beto O\u2019Rourke] is a radical on immigration. \u2026 [He] has proposed decriminalizing crossing the border illegally. That would mean it is the very definition of open borders. That would mean if Beto O\u2019Rourke got his proposal passed, it would mean that the caravan could march right across the Rio Grande, could cross illegally, and they would not have committed a crime.\u201d\n\nCruz went on to say, \u201cThat is by definition opening up our borders. That\u2019s not what the people of Texas want. It\u2019s not what the American people want. We want to secure our border. Beto O\u2019Rourke, from his time in Congress, has made it a priority to fight for illegal aliens.\u201d\n\nCruz concluded, \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke and the modern Democratic Party have gotten radical and extreme in support of open borders and illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nCruz supports President Donald Trump\u2019s call for ending birthright citizenship.\n\n\u201cI agree with President Trump that birthright citizenship is a policy that doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d assessed Cruz. \u201cI have long supported ending birthright citizenship. Most of the countries on Earth don\u2019t grant automatic citizenship. If you\u2019re another country and have a child, in most of the countries on Earth, that child is not automatically a citizen. It\u2019s not a policy that makes sense because it is a policy that incentivizes illegal immigration. It encourages people to come into this country illegally. So I agree we should change it.\u201d\n\nCruz noted disagreement between legal experts over avenues to ending birthright citizenship, saying, \u201cUltimately, the courts will resolve this issue. We should not have policies in place that are encouraging illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nCruz said O\u2019Rourke has deployed racial rhetoric in deriding law enforcement.\n\n\u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke has accused police officers in the state of Texas of being \u201cThe New Jim Crow,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cThat kind of racial demonizing of law enforcement is bad for this country. It\u2019s not true. It\u2019s a lie. He\u2019s essentially called police officers racists and bigots.\u201d\n\nCruz added, \u201cHe alleged that Texas police officers are stopping people solely based on their race, are searching people solely based on their race, and are shooting people solely based on their race. \u2026 That is a lie. To wrongly attack police officers is a sign of where the far-left is going.\u201d\n\nCruz cast O\u2019Rourke as ideologically aligned with Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).\n\n\u201c[Beto O\u2019Rourke] is running a hard-left campaign,\u201d Cruz stated. \u201cHe is running like Elizabeth Warren. He is running like Bernie Sanders, but despite the fact that he\u2019s running so far left, he is the number one Democratic fundraiser in the country. He has raised over $70 million, which is the most ever raised in the history of any Senate race in the state of Texas, and he is outraising and outspending our campaign three to one.\u201d\n\nCruz contrasted the fundraising and spending of his and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaigns.\n\nCruz noted, \u201cMy campaign has a total of 18 paid campaign staffers in the entire state of Texas. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign has 805 paid campaign staffers.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 5, 2018\n\nThe president is no doubt referring to CNN\u2019s poll of the generic congressional ballot that shows Democrats up by a whopping 13 points on the eve of Tuesday\u2019s midterm election.\n\nEven when compared to other media polls, CNN\u2019s poll is not only an outlier, it nearly doubles the overall polling average showing Democrats with only a 7.3 percent lead.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, a number of these generic ballot polls show serious tightening, real movement towards the GOP, while CNN\u2019s stayed the same.\n\nOn Monday, the Politico/Morning Consult poll showed Democrats with only a three point lead, which is down from eight points. The ABC News/Washington Post poll showed Democrats dropping from a 13 point advantage to eight. The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll has Democrats dipping from seven to just six points.\n\nRasmussen Reports, however, which was one of the few pollsters to call the 2016 presidential election accurately, has Republicans up one point Monday. Last week, Democrats enjoyed a three point lead.\n\nWhat Trump means by a \u201csuppression poll\u201d is a poll deliberately rigged to demoralize Republicans, to convince them to stay home because there is no chance of winning.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, in the hands of a 24/7 fake news organization like CNN, a manufactured poll like this one allows the anti-Trump channel to use the poll over the next 36 hours as a talking point. By declaring the race over before all the votes are in, and using polling data to back that narrative, a \u201csuppression poll\u201d is an even more effective propaganda weapon.\n\nBasically, it is a variation of the same kind of media voter suppression we saw in 2016 when everyone in the establishment media said Trump could not win and those who dared disagree were ridiculed.\n\nGiven the history of fake news at CNN during the Trump era \u2014 an unprecedented avalanche of lies, racism, fabricated stories, and open calls for violence against Trump and his supporters \u2014 at the very least, the president is prudent to ask voters to ignore CNN\u2019s wild outlier.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

I think he\u2019s exposed himself for who he really is. I wish him well. I think what him and maybe the producers at SNL should do is pool their money together. Let\u2019s throw a figure out there, $1 million, and we will donate that to a series of veterans nonprofits that helps veterans. Maybe the Navy SEAL Foundation, maybe Wounded Warriors, maybe Folds of Honor. I was just at their benefit last night. There\u2019s a lot of great organizations out there, a lot of veterans that really need help. And frankly, this kind of thing is offensive to them. They feel laughed at.\n\nCAMEROTA: That\u2019s really interesting. I don\u2019t know if Pete Davidson has a million dollars but we\u2019ll see what SNL comes up with and if SNL heeds your call to do something. Meanwhile, while I have you, I do want to ask you about some veterans issues. As you know, President Trump has been talking on the campaign trail about this migrant crisis, as he calls it. This group of migrants from Central America that are still roughly one-thousand miles away from our border. He is saying he\u2019d like to send 15,000 troops to the Southern U.S. border. That\u2019s more than there is in Afghanistan, which is 14,000. And more than are in Iraq \u2014 5,200. Do you think that\u2019s appropriate?\n\nCRENSHAW: I think the president and his advisors need to come up with anyway necessary to make sure that 10,000 people don\u2019t break down our barriers the way they broke down the barriers on the Mexican southern border.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe bottom line is this: We need to stop thousands of people from illegally crossing from one side of our border to the other.", "Billionaire CEO Mike Bloomberg is road-testing his expected 2020 presidential campaign with a soft-focus slam of President Donald Trump for not submitting to the establishment\u2019s priorities.\n\nBloomberg has already spent roughly $110 million to aid Democrats during the 2018 campaign, according to the Washington Post. Now he is spending more funds on a TV advertisement which portrays him as a peace-maker and would-be president.\n\nThe message is being broadcast November 4 and November 5, and it underscores the establishment\u2019s desire for more imported workers and consumers, for more government support of major investors \u2014 and for much less public opposition to their self-serving corporatist agenda.\n\nWith a populist president in the White House, Bloomberg complains, there is too much \u201cshouting and hysterics instead of calm reasoning, pointed fingers instead of open hands, division instead of unity.\u201d\n\nHe claims the United States is and should be a \u201cnation of immigrants\u201d rather than a nation of Americans:\n\nWe see this [disagreement] most dramatically with the fearmongering over immigration.

Kennedy. In his 1964 book A Nation of Immigrants, recently re-released, my great-uncle outlines the compelling case for immigration, in economic, moral, and global terms. \u201cThe abundant resources of this land provided the foundation for a great nation,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut only people could make the opportunity a reality. Immigration provided the human resources.\u201d\n\nFor Bloomberg, the public\u2019s demands for lower immigration and higher wages is a threat to major investors\u2019 alliance with government:\n\nSadly, our greatest threats today can be found within our borders from a government that is constantly on the verge of shutting down over partisan bickering, that is accumulating record debt and failing to address our most urgent problems \u2026 we must send a signal to Republicans in Washington that they have failed to lead, failed to find solutions, and failed to bring us together.

The drill included units from both the national army, which reports to the secular government, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is loyal to the ayatollahs.\n\n\u201cYesterday, Saddam was in front of us. Today Trump is in front of us. There is no difference. We must resist and win,\u201d said Rouhani, alluding to the long and bitter war Iran fought against Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq in the 1980s.\n\nHe claimed Trump administration officials \u201cscore on top of the lawlessness rankings\u201d and comprised the most \u201cracist\u201d group he could recall \u201cassuming power at the White House.\u201d\n\nRouhani promised to \u201cbreak\u201d U.S. sanctions with the help of Europe, which he portrayed as firmly on the side of Tehran.\n\n\u201cToday, we are not the only ones who are angry at U.S. policies.

If our interlocutor honors its words and promises, what will be wrong with talking?\u201d\n\nRouhani said the waivers granted by the United States to nearly all of Iran\u2019s top oil customers were a signal of \u201cdefeat\u201d from the Trump administration. \u201cEven assuming they did not concede defeat and did not grant waivers to countries, we would still be able to sell our oil because we have adequate capabilities to do that,\u201d he boasted.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday addressed criticism from U.S. conservatives that waivers were granted to so many of Iran\u2019s oil customers that the new sanctions have been largely nullified.\n\n\u201cThe sanctions that will be reimposed tomorrow are the toughest sanctions ever put in place on the Islamic Republic of Iran,\u201d Pompeo insisted on Fox News Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re aimed at a singular purpose: denying the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terror the capacity to do things like they did this past couple weeks, attempt an assassination campaign in the heart of Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese sanctions have already had an enormous impact. We\u2019ve already reduced Iranian crude oil exports by over a million barrels per day. That number will fall farther,\u201d he predicted.\n\nPompeo would not firmly state whether Iran\u2019s two biggest customers, India and China, have committed to dramatically reduce oil purchases during the waiver period.\n\n\u201cWatch what we do. Watch as we\u2019ve already taken more crude oil off the market than any time in previous history. Watch the efforts that President Trump\u2019s policies have achieved,\u201d he said.\n\nPompeo announced on Monday that waivers were granted to China, India, South Korea, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Japan, and Taiwan. China, India, South Korea, Turkey, Italy, and Japan are the top six importers of Iranian oil.

Last week, the nation\u2019s Supreme Court issued a ruling dismissing all charges against Bibi, asserting that insufficient evidence exists against her and that those who lied about her blasphemy themselves committed blasphemy by doing so.\n\nThe Pakistani penal code proscribes a variety of punishments for blasphemy against Islam generally. Blasphemy against the person of Muhammad, however, demands a sentence of capital punishment.\n\nIn response, TLP radicals and other Islamic groups flooded the streets of Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, and other major cities demanding Bibi\u2019s death, as well as the death of her defense attorney and the three Supreme Court justices who ruled in her favor. The protests, attracting thousands of Muslim men, initially triggered a stern government response midweek, but by Friday the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan was holding emergency meetings seeking a resolution to the protests.\n\nThe protests forced schools to close, shut down major roads, and damaged businesses.\n\nOn Friday night, the TLP ordered its members to stop rioting and announced that the government had agreed to a deal that would allow for them to appeal Bibi\u2019s acquittal \u2013 despite the Supreme Court being Pakistan\u2019s court of last resort \u2013 and would begin the process of placing Bibi on the nation\u2019s Exit Control List (ECL), banning her from leaving the country, according to the newspaper Dawn. In exchange, the radical Islamist group would have to issue a public apology for its disturbances this week and accept the prosecution of some of its most violent rioters, but nothing more.\n\nTLP patron-in-chief Pir Afzal Qadri issued a statement explaining that their illegitimate appeal would fall in the hands of a new Supreme Court bench not featuring the justices who acquitted Bibi. Qadri added that, should Bibi leave the country and find asylum in a safe region, \u201ca war would immediately begin in the country and there (would be) a call for a revolution.\u201d\n\nThe TL is expected to file the illegitimate appeal on Monday, according to the British Pakistani Christian Association (BPCA), an advocacy group defending Christians in the country who face severe persecution. BPCA has been working closely with the Bibi family for a resolution that will allow the entire family to leave the country, as the mobs have demanded all of their deaths.\n\nThe BPCA is advocating for a neutral country to grant asylum to Bibi, her husband, and her four children before the completion of the bureaucratic process to place her on the Exit Control List.\n\n\u201cThe farce of appeal after appeal, with judges stepping out at the last minute that has gone on for almost 10 years cannot be lost on the World. Why are these human right abuses and these clearly unacceptable blasphemy laws in Pakistan so often ignored?\u201d Wilson Chowdhry, chairman of the BPCA, said in a statement.\n\nBibi\u2019s husband, Ashiq Masih, is urging a Western country to grant the family asylum.\n\n\u201cI request [U.S.] President Donald Trump to help us leave [the country], and I request the prime minister of the U.K. to do their level best to help us, to grant us freedom,\u201d Masih said in a statement this weekend, also urging the Canadian government to act.\n\nAt press time, Bibi is believed to be held in an undisclosed location for her safety; her acquittal has yet to be processed. She has also not received full asylum for her family, though some reports suggest she personally has received offers.\n\nBibi\u2019s attorney, Saiful Mulook, left Pakistan for the Netherlands on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIn the current scenario, it\u2019s not possible for me to live in Pakistan. I need to stay alive as I still have to fight the legal battle for Asia Bibi,\u201d he reportedly told Agence France-Presse. He added that, for him, the protests were expected, but \u201cwhat\u2019s painful is the response of the government. They cannot even implement an order of the country\u2019s highest court.\u201d\n\nThe decision to make a deal with the TLP was met with significant concern on the part of some in the Pakistani government.\n\n\u201cAppeasement historically never works,\u201d Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari wrote on Twitter about the deal. \u201cAppeasement to \u2018avoid bloodshed\u2019 sends a dangerous message to non-state actors and undermines the very concept of democratic, peaceful protest.\u201d\n\nAs a member of the government, however, Mazari concluded that she trusted Prime Minister Imran Khan, who assumed the head of government position in large part thanks to support from radical Islamic groups.\n\nAs the deal between the TLP and the government of Pakistan did not include other Islamist radical groups, protests continued on Monday, as well as extensive police action to arrest and disarm the \u201cmiscreants\u201d continuing to threaten Pakistan\u2019s cities.

Bill Nelson (D-FL) encouraged Florida lawmakers to get all the gun control they can.\n\nHe claimed the criminal use of guns in schools will not end until AR-15s and other commonly owned semiautomatic firearms are banned.\n\nTragically, the deadliest shooting at an institution of higher learning\u2013the April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech attack\u2013cost the lives of 32 people and was carried out by an individual armed with two handguns.\n\nThe Tallahassee Democrat reports that Florida\u2019s legislative session was close to ending when the Parkland shooting occurred, so Nelson encouraged them to get all the gun they could get with the time remaining, then push an \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban upon reconvening in December.\n\nHe stressed that criminal use of guns in schools will not end until private possession of commonly owned semiautomatic firearms are banned: \u201cYou are not going to solve the problem until you get the assault rifles off the street and until you can get a criminal background check on every transfer of a gun.\u201d\n\nHis attack on private gun sales overlooks the fact that Parkland high school attacker did not acquire his gun via a private sale. Rather, he got is via a background check at retail.\n\nIn fact, every high profile attacker since the Virginia Tech attack\u2013school, workplace, or otherwise\u2013has acquired his or her guns via a background check except two. Both of those two, the Sandy Hook Elementary School attacker and the Clackamas Town Center attacker, stole their guns.\n\nThe bottom line is that Nelson\u2019s gun controls would do absolutely nothing to stop the attacks we have witnessed in the 21st century, and that is because those attacks are not due to a certain type of gun or certain means of firearm acquisition. Sadly, they are due to soft targets created by gun-free zones and the Democrats insidious gun control agenda, which does little to disarm criminals but goes a long way in discouraging law-abiding citizens from acquiring guns.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

That really changed the dynamics of your race. Do you think that was handled appropriately by Senate Democratic leaders?\n\nBREDESEN: No. One of the things I feel very strongly in a race here in Tennessee is the national Democratic brand if you will, which is the sum of the kinds of things that people do and the issues they talk about, is a huge problem for me. I didn\u2019t think the Kavanaugh thing was handled properly. I\u2019m a believer in the notion that the role of the Senate is to respect the fact that a president has the right to appoint Supreme Court justices and ones who agree with his philosophy and political philosophy. And the role of the Senate is to make sure that they\u2019re competent and their ability to perform is there. We\u2019ve drifted away from that. Not that long ago Ginsburg could get 95 plus votes and a Scalia could get 95 plus vote. That to me is the way we ought to be acting. I thought immediately coming out against anybody that Trump but up was a mistake, in terms of broadening the base of the party and attracting people in. I thought the way in which the information of Dr. [Christine Blasey] Ford was delayed to the end did not read well at all in a lot of the country. I wish they\u2019d handle it differently. I think it hurt the brand.\n\nHUNT: If you lose your race here, do you think that\u2019s why because what happened with Kavanaugh?\n\nBREDESEN: No, I don\u2019t think it will only be Kavanaugh. I certainly plan to win. If I lose, it will just be because the national Democratic brand is a problem in general for me. And it will be also because I haven\u2019t succeeded in making a case well enough that I\u2019m different enough from them to be considered. I think my party, Democratic party is at its best when it\u2019s sort of gets out of this stuff and gets back to being a strong muscular party that is really focused on opportunity for working-class and middle-class Americans.

It would be a contradiction of faith and life.\u201d\n\n\u201cRather, we are called to commit ourselves to ensure anti-Semitism is banned from the human community,\u201d he said.\n\nAlong with the Shoah, the pope also called to mind two other anniversaries of anti-Jewish violence that must never be forgotten.\n\n\u201cAnother dramatic seventy-fifth anniversary took place on 16 October last: that of the raid on the Roman ghetto,\u201d he said. \u201cJust a few days from now, 9 November will mark the eightieth anniversary of the Kristallnacht, when many Jewish places of worship were destroyed, not least with the intent of uprooting from the hearts of individuals and a people that which is absolutely inviolable: the presence of the Creator.\u201d\n\nThese tragic events remind humanity of the need for religious liberty for all, the pope insisted.\n\n\u201cThe attempt to replace the God of goodness with the idolatry of power and the ideology of hatred ended in the folly of exterminating creatures,\u201d he said. \u201cConsequently, religious freedom is a supreme good to be safeguarded, a fundamental human right and a bulwark against the claims of totalitarianism.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time the pope has condemned anti-Semitism, along with the indifference that allows it to perpetuate.\n\nNot only those who perpetrate violence and spread hate are to blame for the evils of anti-Semitism, he said last January, but also those who allow it to fester through their indifference or apathy.\n\nSpeaking before participants in a conference against anti-Semitism, Francis underscored the wider complicity of a society that sometimes turns a blind eye to the evils being carried out in its midst.\n\nThe enemy against which we fight \u201cis not only hatred in all of its forms,\u201d Francis said, \u201cbut even more fundamentally, indifference; for it is indifference that paralyzes and impedes us from doing what is right even when we know that it is right.\u201d\n\nFollow Thomas D.

It\u2019s been over a year since I\u2019ve tuned into the NFL, and I am happy to say, I don\u2019t really miss it.\n\nFor the most part, not at all.\n\nFor about three decades, National Football League football was pretty much my favorite sport to watch. Each game meant so much. I would watch my Chicago Bears every Sunday, followed by the late game, and then the Sunday Night contest. I\u2019d tune in for Monday Night Football. I would catch any Thursday and Saturday action they would throw at us too. Thanksgiving was filled with the NFL. The playoffs were basically holidays. The NFL was king around here. If you would\u2019ve told me I would not be watching for one week, let alone for multiple seasons, I would\u2019ve thought you had your bell rung by Andrew Sendejo. But now, for better or worse, that is indeed the case. In a major upset, I do not watch the NFL, and it\u2019s been a heck of a lot easier to cut ties with the once beloved league then I ever could have imagined.\n\nColin Kaepernick\u2019s garbage and the lack of any NFL player speaking out against his pathetic display was the last straw for me, but the NFL was crumbling way before Mr. Nike put his knee on the turf during our beautiful National Anthem. Roger Goodell was already transforming the NFL into a shell of its former self. Changing the kickoff rules, moving the extra point back, an obsession with England, Thursdays, and bad uniforms is just a small list of Goodell\u2019s awfulness. Not to mention the fact that tackling is now frowned upon in a league that once produced Crunchtime videos highlighting men like Steve Atwater and John Lynch going for the big hit play after play. We\u2019ve gone from Dick Butkus to don\u2019t touch us. From L.T. to he hurt me. The old NFL is gone forever.\n\nWhile it was a hard pill to swallow, I still tuned in week after week to the new NFL, a league that caters to offensive players, casual fans, and fantasy football nerds. After all, this league was once the greatest thing going. Even half the product it used to be was still worth a watch. When the kneelers and fist hoisters took center stage however, I was done. I love the Bears. My high school yearbook\u2019s \u201cCan You Imagine\u201d section asks \u201cCan you imagine Kevin without the Bears?\u201d I used masking tape on my mortarboard at graduation, so it read \u2018Bears\u2019 on the top for all to see. One of my children is named after a Bears great. I have bled Navy and Orange. But when all is said and done, it\u2019s sadly become football vs. country, and my true allegiance will always go to Red, White, and Blue.\n\nIf you had to make a case for watching the NFL under its current climate, the Bears would serve as a good example for tuning in. Not only is the team on the rise and by all accounts, exciting to watch for the first time in several seasons, but the Monsters of the Midway have pretty much been the least controversial club in the league. Not one Bears player has taken a knee. Not one Bear has protested in any way during the Star Spangled Banner. The Bears are not the 49ers or Dolphins. Not even close. But no matter what the Bears do or don\u2019t do, they are still a member of the NFL. The same NFL that keeps the anti-patriotism ramped up at every turn. While baseball has been tremendously patriotic and pro-USA the last few seasons, the NFL keeps showcasing and babying players who continue to disrespect our flag, our veterans, our president, and our police officers. I do not want to be associated with such an organization.\n\nWhile I have dumped the NFL, I have not said goodbye to the great game of football. Far from it. I\u2019m coaching my son\u2019s tackle team and my daughter\u2019s flag squad. I\u2019ve watched every Florida Gators game this season and plenty of other college ball. I\u2019ve also enjoyed my share of CFL action. If you haven\u2019t seen our friends playing north of the border, you are missing out. The Canadian Football League is as exciting as ever. Teams like the Ottawa Redblacks are putting on quite a show. Plenty of excellent American players are in the CFL too. Ottawa\u2019s Anthony Cioffi for one is taking Canada by storm. The former Rutgers standout, who should be in the NFL, is playing football the right way every game. The CFL presents gridiron action like the NFL used to. It\u2019 all about football instead of millionaires whining about Trump and empty suits still trying to determine what the heck constitutes a catch.\n\nTaking the time-consuming NFL off of my schedule has allowed me to not only watch more college football, but it has allowed me to focus more on more important things. Sundays are now dedicated to church, youth sports, relaxing, walking the dogs, and family time. Kaepernick and friends didn\u2019t ruin my life, instead they opened my eyes. As I look at some of these zombie fans engrossed in the NFL seemingly at all times, I feel almost embarrassed about how much time I wasted on the NFL in the past. From grown men wearing jerseys of players twenty years their junior to people\u2019s weeks ruined if their team loses to those who chose staring at a TV screen over spending time with family, today\u2019s NFL experience is pathetic at best.\n\nSo many are stunned when they find out I truly do not watch the NFL anymore. I\u2019m stunned more people aren\u2019t doing what I\u2019m doing. The NFL of Mike Ditka and Michael Strahan morphed into the NFL of Mike Vick and Michael Sam. We went from Rozelle and Tagliabue to Goodell. I had Montana and Young. Our kids have Kaepernick. Little by little, the once amazing spectacle has become a big disappointment that no Color Rush uniforms could ever disguise. But there is a way out. As Kaepernick\u2019s company tells us \u2018Just Do It\u2019.\n\nI haven\u2019t watched NFL football for over a full season now. For the first time in my life, I did not watch the Super Bowl. It\u2019s OK. It\u2019s actually liberating. There\u2019s a lot to do out there on Sundays. You can break free too. Some habits are hard to break but if you stand for something (like the flag for instance) it\u2019s incredible what you are capable of. After unveiling their weird policy of allowing men in their girls bathrooms, I cut ties completely with retail giant Target. I shopped there multiple times a week. It\u2019s been almost three years since I\u2019ve set foot in a Target store. Just like Target, the NFL is easier to ditch than you may think.\n\nIn the meantime, I will continue to thoroughly enjoy coaching youth ball, watching college action, and cheering on the great men of the CFL. Plus there\u2019s plenty of hockey, basketball, and baseball on tap. Best of all, we are inching ever closer to the XFL as well, making President Trump\u2019s reelection one of two things the NFL can look forward to crying about in 2020.\n\nFollow Kevin Scholla on Twitter @kevinscholla", "Sen.

Ten days ago, in the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Manchin led by nearly 13 points. That lead is now down to just five points, with Manchin sitting well below 50 percent (46 percent), a dangerous place for an incumbent, especially with the momentum moving against him.\n\nManchin also made his comments after an especially dangerous month for Republicans.\n\nIn October, there were over 40 acts of violence and harassment aimed at the GOP, including seven violent attacks by leftists against GOP campaign and meeting places.\n\nThroughout last month, there was an assassination attempt against President Trump; the New York Times published an article fantasizing about Trump\u2019s assassination; there were a total of 12 recorded rape and death threats against Republicans and their families (including children); there were nine assaults and attempted assaults; six recorded acts of harassment, and a Trump supporter\u2019s truck was destroyed in an arson fire.\n\nTo make matters worse, high-raking Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder have called for violence and incivility, while the far-left CNN has openly called for the harassment of Republican lawmakers.\n\nDuring the Trump era, there have been over 630 recorded acts of violence, vandalism, threats, harassment, menacing, and open calls for more against Trump and his supporters.\n\nAs has been the case with the 40-plus acts of violence last month, and the 630 acts recorded over the last two or so years, the establishment have ignored or downplayed Manchin\u2019s remarks.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

In the RealClearPolitics map of competitive districts, Montana\u2019s at-large congressional district is rated as a toss-up.\n\nIf the RealClearPolitics estimation that 195 other districts are likely, lean, or solid Republican is correct, then the GOP would need to win 23 or more of the 38 listed toss-up districts to hold the majority in the House\u2013and being able to slide Montana into the win column means it is even easier for Republicans to do what most analysts thought to be impossible on election day.\n\nRosendale\u2019s lead in Montana comes in large part thanks to multiple campaign appearances by President Trump for him in the state, the latest and final of which was on Saturday as part of the president\u2019s national tour in the final days leading up to the midterm elections.\n\nOn stage at the Trump rally on Saturday, Rosendale made the case that Trump\u2019s policies are on the ballot this year:\n\nTrump made the case against Tester by noting what he did to tank the nomination of Ronny Jackson, his nominee to head the Veterans Affairs department, with phony allegations\u2013a strategy employed more widely by Senate Democrats later, and unsuccessfully, against now Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh:\n\nTrump hammering Jon Tester in Montana for 'trying to destroy' Ronny Jackson for VA Sec. \"I\u2019ve never forgotten,\" Trump says. \"And it\u2019s honestly one of the reasons I\u2019ve been here so much.\" \u2014 Tessa Berenson (@tcberenson) November 3, 2018\n\nOn Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 before the Trump rally, Rosendale emphasized that point: he argued that Tester invented and honed the Democrat tactics used against Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.\n\n\u201cHe opposed Gorsuch, he opposed Brett Kavanaugh and participated in the character assassinations that the Democrats had reverted to and just not the kind of person that represents the values of the people of Montana,\u201d Rosendale said.", "\"We may cross 100 million total vote...when you have a turnout like this, it's going to make pollster's look ridiculous, not because they don't do a good job but you cannot accommodate for all these new voters,\" @chucktodd on the huge voter turnout. pic.twitter.com/QMgLqFVajV\n\nMonday on \u201cThe Today Show,\u201d Chuck Todd commented on the expected huge voter turnout for the midterm election, predicting the number of voters may exceed 100 million.\n\nWith such a large number now being expected, Todd hedged on pollsters\u2019 projections, saying they could end up looking \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we may cross 100 million total vote,\u201d said Todd.\n\nHe added, \u201c[W]hen you have a turnout like this, it\u2019s going to make pollsters look ridiculous, not because they don\u2019t do a good job but because you cannot accommodate for all these new voters,\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Freddie Mercury biopic \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d and 20th Century Fox are \u2014 for now, at least \u2014 champions of the world.\n\n\u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d starring Rami Malek as the late Queen frontman, shrugged off production troubles and mediocre reviews to debut with $50 million in weekend ticket sales in U.S. and Canada, and another $72.5 million internationally, according to studio estimates Sunday. That was well beyond expectations, which had pegged the film closer to $35-40 million in its opening weekend.\n\nBut audiences rushed to theaters to see the widely praised performance by Malek, the \u201cMr. Robot\u201d star, and to hear Queen\u2019s foot-stomping anthems like \u201cWe are the Champions,\u201d \u2033Another One Bites the Dust\u201d and the operatic title song.

According to the report:\n\nHe said that the kiss happened in the bedroom of a house which was about a 15-to 20 minute walk from the Van Ness Metro, that Dr. Ford was wearing a swimsuit under her clothing, and that the kissing ended when a friend jumped on them as a joke. [Redacted] said that the woman initiated the kissing and that he did not force himself on her.\n\nThe man\u2019s description of his encounter with Ford is similar to the one Ford alleged she had with Kavanaugh in three ways.\n\nFirst, the man said the incident took place in the bedroom of a house that was near the Van Ness Metro station, which is located in Northwest Washington, DC, near the border of Montgomery County, Maryland. Ford claimed the incident with Kavanaugh took place in a bedroom of a house in Montgomery County.\n\nSecond, the man said Ford was wearing a swimsuit underneath her clothing, which Ford claimed was also the case in the Kavanaugh incident. Ford\u2019s detail of wearing a one-piece bathing suit was so specific that Bustle recently dedicated a post to it titled, \u201cI Can\u2019t Stop Thinking About Dr. Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s One-Piece Swimsuit.\u201d\n\nThird, the man said the kissing between him and Ford ended when a friend jumped on them as a joke. Ford claimed that with Kavanaugh, his friend Mark Judge had jumped on them, allowing her to escape.\n\nFord first publicly spoke about her allegations against Kavanaugh to the Washington Post on September 16, 2018, including the detail about wearing a one-piece bathing suit underneath her clothing. According to the Post:\n\nSpeaking publicly for the first time, Ford said that one summer in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh and a friend \u2014 both \u201cstumbling drunk,\u201d Ford alleges \u2014 corralled her into a bedroom during a gathering of teenagers at a house in Montgomery County. While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth. \u201cI thought he might inadvertently kill me,\u201d said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California. \u201cHe was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.\u201d Ford said she was able to escape when Kavanaugh\u2019s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling. She said she ran from the room, briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house.\n\nThe report also revealed that another man, whose name is also redacted, said that during that the summer of 1982, he had attended a house party where he \u201ckissed and made out with a woman he met who he believes could have been Dr. Ford. [Redacted] said that based on old photographs of Justice Kavanaugh he has seen on the news, he believes the two of them share a similar appearance.\u201d\n\nThe report includes the two men\u2019s summaries but does not comment on whether Ford may have confused or mistaken one of the men\u2019s identities for Kavanaugh.\n\nThe report said that the committee conducted interviews with more than 40 individuals with information relating to allegations against Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cCommittee investigators found no witness who could provide any verifiable evidence to support any of the allegations brought against Justice Kavanaugh,\u201d it said.\n\nThe report also revealed the committee has recommended charges against one accuser, Julie Swetnick, her lawyer Michael Avenatti, a man in Rhode Island, and a woman who claimed to have submitted an anonymous letter accusing Kavanaugh of rape, for knowingly providing materially false statements and obstruction of a congressional investigation.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the committee is investigating whether a friend of Ford and former FBI official Monica McLean, had tried to tamper with witness testimony by trying to persuade another friend of Ford, Leland Keyser, to change her testimony.", "God Bless the USA singer Lee Greenwood appeared on stage Sunday night with President Donald Trump for a rally in Tennessee.\n\nPresident Trump posted a big thank you and \u201cGOD BLESS THE U.S.A.!\u201d to Greenwood following the rally in Tennessee with video of the thousands of rally-goers packing the stadium:\n\nThank you for joining us tonight in Tennessee, @TheLeeGreenwood.

I\u2019m unwilling to sit by and accept it.\u201d\n\nBloomberg has spent $30 million on Television ads alone for Democrats running in the midterm election. As Breitbart News\u2019 AWR Hawkins wrote last month, \u201cBloomberg\u2019s overall commitment is to spend $100 million this election cycle to see gun controllers take control of the House. On October 10, 2018, Breitbart News reported that Bloomberg is only one of many liberal billionaires trying to spend enough to flip the House.\u201d\n\nBloomberg\u2019s mammoth midterm spending has raised eyebrows among Republican leaders, notably House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), who recently told Fox News\u2019 Sunday Morning Futures host Maria Bartiromo that Bloomberg, along with far-left billionaires George Soros and Tom Steyer are dropping millions into Democrat committees in a bid to \u201cbuy our government.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust think the three individuals who are funding the Democratic Party, George Soros, you\u2019ve got Michael Bloomberg, it\u2019s not just $80 million into the House, he put another $20 million to try to win the Senate, then Tom Steyer, more than a $120 million he\u2019s spent trying to win,\u201d McCarthy told Bartiromo. \u201cHis win goal is to try to impeach President Trump. He brags that his impeachment list is bigger than the NRA list. Those three individuals are trying to buy our government in this process.

Darrell Issa\u2019s congressional seat tightened in a poll released Friday as Republicans remain at risk of losing House control.\n\nRepublican Harkey garnered 44 percent support to Democrat Levin\u2019s 51 percent with a margin of error of 5.4 percent among the 500 likely voters surveyed from October 29 to November 1. Among independents only in the KGTV-San Diego Union-Tribune/SurveyUSA poll, ten percent were undecided while 55 favored Levin and 35 favored Harkey.\n\nThe 49th congressional district voted went to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election while Republican Rep. Darrell Issa held on to his seat by less than one percentage point. The Republican district was highly targeted by the Democrats in 2016 and again in the 2018 midterm elections. They have identified the district among California congressional seats integral to flipping control of the House.\n\nThe presidency was the top issue for Democrats in the 40th congressional district in the new poll. This was also the top issue among independents followed by immigration and climate change.\n\nPresident Donald Trump received a net eight percent disapproval rate in the poll with 43 percent approving of the jobs he is doing and 51 percent disapproving. Just 37 percent of respondents approved of the job current 49th district Rep. Issa is doing, 46 percent disapproved.\n\nImmigration, economy, taxes, and health care were the top issues among Republicans surveyed.\n\nThe SurveyUSA poll shows a drastic tightening of the race since polls taken September and October 19-24. Those polls were conducted by Berkeley IGS and NY Times/Siena College.\n\nRespondents enthusiastically supported Harkey at 67 percent and Levin at 70 percent.\n\nLevin benefits from a heavy influx of campaign cash and visits from former President Barack Obama, his political hero House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, and comedian Chelsea Handler.

But\u2026\n\nIf Aquaman opens to just $40 million, it will be the 17th worst opening in DC\u2019s history and come in behind DC movies that are nearly 30-years-old, like 1989\u2019s original Batman.\n\nObviously, when you are talking about dollars that reach back to the eighties, there is an inflation factor, but that inflation factor will only make Aquaman\u2019s failure look even worse.\n\nThe perfect apples-to-apples comparison, of course, is to compare Aquaman\u2019s estimated opening to its own franchise, the current DC franchise that launched five years ago, with 2013\u2019s Man of Steel, so here are how those five entries launched:\n\nMan of Steel: ($117 million)\n\nBatman v Superman: ($166 million)\n\nSuicide Squad: ($133 million)\n\nWonder Woman: ($103 million)\n\nJustice League: ($94 million)\n\nNote the diminishing returns.\n\nInterest in DC peaked with Batman v. Superman, but the problem was that Warner Bros. did not make a very good movie. And so, even with the presence of Will Smith, the entry that followed, Suicide Squad, opened much lower. While I personally enjoyed Suicide Squad, I was in the minority, and that disappointment reflected in Wonder Woman\u2019s opening. Fortunately, people loved Wonder Woman, and it eventually grossed $412M domestic, which makes it the most popular title in this franchise \u2014 and by a wide mile.\n\nAnd then along came Justice League, a legitimate creative and commercial disaster. What should have been DC\u2019s version of Marvel\u2019s Avengers, a culmination of the previous four titles that lit the box office on fire, ended up being a franchise killer.\n\nWith that laughable $94 million, Justice League not only opened well below where it should have, it petered out with a miserable domestic gross of just $229 million. Worldwide, Justice League\u2019s dreadful $657 million means it actually lost money.\n\nBut by the time Justice League crashed, Aquaman was already in the can, so there was no way to kill this \u201cVery Bad Idea.\u201d And now it already appears doomed.\n\nWonder Woman will stride on in 2020. That sequel is already in production. But Henry Cavill wants out as Superman. Ben Affleck, who never looked comfortable as Bruce Wayne or Batman, is probably done \u2014 no new movies featuring either Superman or Batman are scheduled. This leaves the soul of the DC universe in disarray and all of Warner\u2019s hopes pinned to two titles no one asked for \u2014 next year\u2019s Shazam! and 2020\u2019s Birds of Prey.\n\nIn worse news, the reported budget for Aquaman is $160 million. Safe to say, Warners will spend another $60 to $85 million for promotion, which means it will have earn somewhere romantically close to $450 million worldwide just to break even.\n\nTo be fair, it is early.\n\nAquaman\u2019s one big trump card is director James Wan, a legitimate talent. Great reviews could boost Aquaman\u2019s box office. Like Wonder Woman, if it is a legitimately good movie, people will show up. What this tracking shows, though, is how much faith moviegoers have lost in the franchise and brand.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Decorations on the door, including pictures of his family, had been torn down, media reported Friday.\n\nOne sign posted on Abrams\u2019 door read, \u201cOur right to exist is not \u2018ideological,\u2019 asshole,\u201d and was signed \u201ctranssexual fag.\u201d\n\nOn being informed of the incident, Sarah Lawrence president, Cristle Collins Judd, sent out a campus-wide email mentioning the importance of free expression, but mostly stressing her \u201ccommitment to diversity and inclusive excellence.\u201d\n\nDuring a phone conversation with Abrams, Judd reportedly accused him of \u201cattacking\u201d his colleagues.\n\n\u201cShe said I had created a hostile work environment,\u201d Abrams told the online news outlet Reason, noting that if his op-ed constituted hate speech, \u201cthen this is not a world that I want to be a part of.\u201d\n\nLater, Abrams met with Judd face to face, at which time the president suggested that Abrams should consider looking for a new job.\n\n\u201cI am not on the job market,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cI am tenured, I live in New York. Why would I go on the job market?\u201d\n\nIn his column for the New York Times, Abrams noted that school administrators at Sarah Lawrence had hosted a series of partisan political events, all of which featured progressive ideas and talking points.\n\nAbrams said he went on to survey a nationally representative sample of roughly 900 college administrators and found that liberal staff members \u201coutnumber their conservative counterparts by the astonishing ratio of 12-to-one.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly 6 percent of campus administrators identified as conservative to some degree, while 71 percent classified themselves as liberal or very liberal,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder so much of the nonacademic programming on college campuses is politically one-sided.\u201d\n\nAmong all groups on American college campuses \u2014 students, faculty, and administrators \u2014 the most liberal group by far were the administrators, Abrams found.\n\n\u201cIt appears that a fairly liberal student body is being taught by a very liberal professoriate \u2014 and socialized by an incredibly liberal group of administrators,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhile considerable focus has been placed in recent decades on the impact of the ideological bent of college professors, when it comes to collegiate life\u2014living in dorms, participating in extracurricular organizations\u2014the ever growing ranks of administrators have the biggest influence on students and campus life across the country,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAfter the publication of the op-ed, there was an emergency meeting of the student senate, which called for Abrams \u201cto be stripped of tenure and dismissed from the college.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Senate asked me to publicly affirm that Black Lives Matter, that LBGT+ Lives matter, and that Women\u2019s Justice matters,\u201d Judd said. \u201cI emphatically did.\u201d\n\nThe liberal bias among college administrators is a matter of public record, and \u201cdiversity\u201d \u2014 the enforcement of progressive ideas \u2014 has become a lucrative field in academics.\n\nThe diversity office at the University of Michigan, for instance, has an $11 million payroll for its 100 employees.\n\nThe newly appointed Vice President of Diversity at Ohio University earns $200,000 per year.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

Now they are applying the same technique with bol\u00edvar notes, most of which are defunct are effectively worthless.\n\nAs well as selling decorative ornaments such as lamps, vases, swans, boats, and musical instruments, some of their designs have a practical use, with items including wallets, purses, and backpacks. According to one of the merchants, who prefers to remain anonymous, the products are more popular with local Colombians than Venezuelans, which he suggests is because of the bad memories evoked by their country\u2019s currency crisis.\n\nIt is not the first instance of Venezuelans using their currency for creative purposes. Last December, Breitbart reported on the work of 25-year-old tattoo artist and illustrator Jos\u00e9 Le\u00f3n, whose project \u201cVenezuela Unchained\u201d used bol\u00edvar notes to create art canvasses of \u201cgreat characters, scenarios, and psychedelic concepts.\u201d\n\nCurrency inflation in Venezuela began to soar as early as 2007 under the rule of former leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez but has now reached levels similar to Germany\u2019s Weimar Republic or Zimbabwe, where people loaded up wheelbarrows full of cash to buy products as well as the introduction of a 100-trillion-dollar banknote.\n\nThe Venezuelan regime has repeatedly tried to deal with the problem of inflation by increasing the country\u2019s minimum wage and releasing higher denomination bank notes. In July, socialist dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro removed five zeroes from the bol\u00edvar\u2019s value and increased the minimum wage 30-fold, a move he declared would spark \u201cgreat revolutionary changes in the economy that Venezuela demands.\u201d\n\nThe measures worsened the problem. The International Monetary Fund predicted this year that inflation will reach one million percent by the end of 2018. Despite the regime\u2019s hatred towards the United States, growing numbers of Venezuelan merchants now only accept payments in U.S. dollars, raising speculation that the country will eventually be forced to revert to the dollar in a post-Maduro economy.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "Baltimore construction firms are training and hiring hundreds of ex-convicts because they cannot hire enough migrants in President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d economy.\n\nProject Jumpstart \u201cis a training program that prepares Baltimore residents for work in construction,\u201d says a CNBC report:\n\nIt\u2019s a 90-hour course designed to get workers ready for the realities of the construction job site.

That high-migration policy boosted Wall Street by lowering wages for employees, so it pushed many young Americans out of the workforce. In 2008, the construction industry collapsed, sharply reducing the number of experienced workers.\n\nSince 2017, Trump\u2019s immigration policy has reduced the inflow of refugees and illegal immigrants. Trump has also resisted the push by companies and GOP leaders to raise the inflow of cheap visa-workers. This policy is pressuring companies to spend more money to find, train and hire replacements from the nation\u2019s population of high-school dropouts, disabled people, and people with a criminal record. The worker shortage is also forcing up wages, especially for the least-skilled groups.\n\nTrump\u2019s fast-growing economy added 250,000 jobs in October, pushing unemployment to record lows, and prodding companies to compete with each other for the shrinking supply of workers.\n\n\u201cThis is the best labor environment in over a decade,\u201d Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at a consulting firm, RSM U.S., told the Washington Post.

This is not San Francisco values here,\u201d Harkey told the crowd, to cheers.\n\nShe told Breitbart News that she hoped for a win, despite being massively outspent by her opponent.\n\nThe \u201cYes on 6\u201d campaign has had to overcome numerous other obstacles, in addition to a misleading ballot title. Democrats changed the rules for recall elections in a failed attempt to protect State Sen. Josh Newman from being recalled over his vote for the gas tax earlier this year; and contractors for the state transportation agency were caught campaigning against Proposition 6 on the job.\n\nJoel B.

The gunmen ordered everyone to get out of the buses and then began shooting them in cold blood, with the number of dead reportedly between 7 and 13, with many more injured.\n\nAmong those slaughtered by the militants were at least three children and seven women, reports stated.\n\nOn Sunday, the Egyptian interior ministry said that police had killed 19 Islamist militants believed to have been involved in Friday\u2019s deadly assault.\n\nThe ministry statement said that police had pursued \u201cfugitive terrorist elements\u201d into the desert area west of Minya province where a shoot-out ensued in which the 19 reportedly died.\n\nAlong with the statement, the ministry posted images of bodies and a tent in which the militants were reported to have been hiding. They also showed guns, rifles and Islamic State propaganda next to the bodies.\n\nOn Saturday, funeral services were held for a number of the murdered Christians and news media reported that a number of people expressed their anger for the brutal attack.\n\n\u201cWhat do these terrorists want? Do they want us to hate Muslims?\u201d said a 23-year-old man named Michel, who lost a neighbor in the attack.\n\n\u201cShould I carry a gun with me when I go to pray or when I\u2019m at home? Because I could die if I go to church,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Coptic-Catholic bishop of Asyut, Kyrillos William, claimed that Islamic terrorists in Egypt \u201cwant to destabilize the state,\u201d reinforcing the belief that terrorism cannot be suppressed. They are saying that \u201cwe are still here and we are still active,\u201d the prelate added.\n\nEgyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said the attack would \u201cnot affect the will of our country in continuing the battle for survival and construction.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe confirm our determination to continue our efforts to combat terrorism,\u201d el-Sissi said in a statement Friday evening.\n\nShortly after the attack, the Islamic State terror group claimed responsibility for the assault, which replicated a similar attack against Egyptian Christians en route to the same pilgrimage site in May, 2017.\n\nThat attack left 28 dead.\n\nFollow Thomas D.
