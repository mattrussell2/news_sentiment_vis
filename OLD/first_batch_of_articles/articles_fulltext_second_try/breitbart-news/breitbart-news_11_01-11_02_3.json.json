["Democrat Senator Heidi Heitkamp was caught in a lie over soybeans, tariffs, and her Republican opponent Kevin Cramer when the North Dakota farm she exploited debunked her claims.\n\nHeitkamp posted video of a pile of soybeans in North Dakota on October 27 along with the claim, \u201cThis huge pile of unsold soybeans in Casselton is what the trade war looks like. Our farmers can\u2019t sell their beans & it\u2019s hurting our economy.

The farm cleared up that the soybean pile Heitkamp used in her post said the pile would start getting picked up within a week. The farm included an image with the excavator that will be used to load it. \u201cIf all goes well it should be off the ground before Thanksgiving. Fun fact: The pile is almost exactly the same size it was last year.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s administration has imposed certain tariffs on imports such as steel and aluminum on the basis of national security. China has issued retaliatory tariffs on industries that are seen as having the potential to politically influence Trump. Heitkamp used an industry that China has targeted to hurt the United States to attack her political opponent and the Trump administration in the October 27 post and in a similar ad slamming Cramer. Trump\u2019s administration, however, has issued a package of temporary assistance to industries such as the soybean industry to weather the storm of attacks from foreign attacks like China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs.\n\nMichelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News \u2014 follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook", "President Donald Trump will hold a Friday evening rally in Indiana with Vice President Mike Pence for Republican Senate candidate Mike Braun.\n\nBraun has a slight lead in the polls as he seeks to unseat incumbent Sen.

The travel ban seeks to halt all immigration from the following nations until \u201cextreme vetting\u201d procedures can be properly implemented:\n\nChad\n\nIran\n\nIraq\n\nLibya\n\nNorth Korea\n\nSyria\n\nVenezuela\n\nYemen\n\nSix of the eight countries included in Trump\u2019s travel ban have either sponsored Islamic terrorism in the past or have major issues with terrorism.\n\nThe Harvard/Harris Poll reveals that nearly half of American men support the travel ban, while four-in-ten female voters support the ban. A majority of white Americans, Republican voters, conservatives, and Trump supporters support the travel ban as well.\n\nTrump\u2019s travel ban is so popular and mainstream among Trump supporters and conservatives that more than seven-in-ten support the immigration moratorium on the eight foreign countries.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, the U.S. has imported more than 131,000 foreign nationals from the terrorist-prone countries included in the travel ban between 2014 and 2016. This is a foreign population that is nearly four times the size of Beverly Hills, California.", "Immigration has now been the leading issue facing the nation for Republican and conservative voters for the past eight months, a new poll reveals.\n\nThe latest Harvard/Harris Poll finds that for the eighth consecutive month, immigration is named as the number one priority in the country by Republicans, conservatives, and supporters of President Trump.\n\nA total of 51 percent of Republican voters say immigration is the most important issue in the country, while 52 percent of conservatives and 51 percent of Trump voters say the same.\n\nThe poll reveals, again, that immigration \u2014 not tax reform \u2014 is mobilizing Trump\u2019s base of support in the midterm elections. In fact, more GOP voters, conservatives, and Trump supporters believe the national debt is more of a priority than tax reform.\n\nAmong all likely voters, immigration is the second biggest issue facing the nation, just behind healthcare. Meanwhile, for all likely voters, tax reform ranks below even obscure issues like guns and the national debt. All likely voters put as much importance on tax reform as they do climate change.\n\nAs Breitbart News most recently reported, a migrant caravan of 7,000 to 10,000 Central Americans is largely viewed as a threat to the nation among likely midterm voters in Arizona, Florida, and Indiana.\n\nEvery year, the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from family-based \u201cchain migration,\u201d whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country.\n\nIn 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high of 44 million. By 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the U.S. will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire U.S. population.", "Hackers are reportedly attempting to sell the private Facebook messages of at least 81,000 accounts, after compromising the social network.

And the data had probably been obtained through malicious browser extensions,\u201d the BBC continued, adding that the hackers \u201coffered to sell access for 10 cents (8p) per account\u201d in an advertisement which has since been taken down.\n\nThe BBC confirmed that private Facebook messages had been stolen in the compromise, and validated the messages with the respective accounts, which included \u201can intimate correspondence between two lovers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have contacted browser-makers to ensure that known malicious extensions are no longer available to download in their stores,\u201d declared Facebook\u2019s Vice President of Product, Guy Rosen, in a statement. \u201cWe have also contacted law enforcement and have worked with local authorities to remove the website that displayed information from Facebook accounts.\u201d", "Iran has designated November 4 a \u201cday of fight\u201d against the \u201cU.S.-Israeli-Saudi triangle of terrorism.\u201d The date is significant for two reasons: it is the anniversary of Iran\u2019s monstrous takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979 and, not coincidentally, it was chosen by the United States as the day renewed sanctions against Iran will take effect.\n\nIranian Brigadier General Gholam Reza Jalali told worshippers after Friday prayers in Tehran that November 4 \u201cshould be commemorated as the day of confrontation with the U.S., which is the manifestation of terrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, the enemy has begun a new phase of confrontation with us, in which we are faced with a combination of threats including psychological operations using the media, cognitive operations to influence the people through economic warfare, and the imposition of sanctions and the attempt to insecure Iran,\u201d he said.\n\nJalali was quoted by another \u201csemi-official\u201d news agency called ISNA this week claiming the Iranian president\u2019s cell phone was \u201cbugged\u201d by unknown parties, and also that Iran\u2019s cybersecurity teams have thwarted a new effort to infect government computers with the Stuxnet virus, widely seen as an American-Israeli cyberattack on Iran\u2019s nuclear program in 2010.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei alluded to this claim on Sunday when he called for \u201cscientific, accurate, and up-to-date\u201d measures against \u201cthe enemy\u2019s complex practices\u201d and attempts at \u201cinfiltration.\u201d\n\n\u201cNovember 4 this year translates into a new instance of oppression by America,\u201d President Hassan Rouhani thundered earlier this week.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif on Thursday tried blaming Israel\u2019s Mossad for running a \u201cprogram to kill the JCPOA,\u201d which is the formal name of the nuclear deal. Zarif portrayed the sinister Israelis as manipulating the Americans with what appears to be an \u201cincredible series of coincidences\u201d when examined by less practiced eyes than his own.\n\nThe Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) pitched in a few weeks ago with a marching drill that depicted the U.S. White House adorned with a giant Star of David while soldiers chanted, \u201cAmerica, America, death to your deception!

On the contrary, Iran\u2019s official mythology portrays the kidnapping of 52 American diplomats as a justified response to American support for the overthrown Iranian monarchy, describing the former U.S. embassy as a \u201cden of espionage.\u201d\n\nThe Iranian government organizes rallies on the embassy kidnapping anniversary every year as a demonstration of revolutionary commitment, nationalist fervor, and anti-Americanism. The slogan for this year\u2019s event translates to \u201cNever to Humiliation!\u201d\n\nThis year, the Iranian government will have to convince some citizens to stop protesting Tehran for a couple of days so it can protest Washington. Not only that, but unhappy Iranian citizens have lately developed a bit of nostalgia for the late Shah Reza Pahlavi and have been overheard wondering if the hardline Islamist revolution commemorated on November 4 was really such a good idea.\n\nIt usually is not difficult for the regime to get people in the streets waving \u201cDown with U.S.A.\u201d signs, and many of them are willing to hold U.S. sanctions wholly or partially responsible for Iran\u2019s terrible economy, but Reuters found the Iranian man-on-the-street in a weird place on Friday because the regime has been laboring so hard to convince them American sanctions mean little against the might of Iran.\n\nThe theocracy is simultaneously attempting to tell its people the sanctions are a trifling distraction and they are the primary reason the currency is collapsing and rice costs three times as much as it used to. President Rouhani was last heard confidently predicting \u201cthe Americans will fail in their new plot and that they are actually in gradual retreat,\u201d which somewhat interferes with the message that America is the reason Tehran\u2019s store shelves are turning bare.\n\nSome members of the Iranian business class are keenly aware the sanctions specifically exempt food and medicine, while others worry that all commerce will become extremely difficult as sanctions ratchet up. Reuters found some Iranians who are simply tired of protesting both their own government and others.", "President Donald Trump responded to former President Barack Obama after the former president accused him of lying about health care.\n\nTrump reminded Obama about his lies about health care when he was trying to pass Obamacare.\n\n\u201cTwenty-eight times, he said, \u2018You can keep your doctor if you like your doctor.

Terrence O\u2019Shaughnessy said Tuesday that the main caravan was unlike anything officials have seen before.\n\n\u201cThis caravan is different from what we\u2019ve seen in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen violence coming out of the caravan, and we\u2019ve seen as they\u2019ve passed other international borders, we\u2019ve seen them behave in a nature that is not what we\u2019ve seen in the past.\u201d\n\nThe DHS said Thursday that more than 270 individuals in the caravan have criminal histories.\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about individuals along the caravan route. In fact, over 270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories, including known gang membership,\u201d it said in a \u201cMyth vs. Fact: Caravan\u201d press release.\n\nIt continues:\n\nThose include a number of violent criminals \u2013 examples include aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, armed robbery, sexual assault on a child, and assault on a female. Mexican officials have also publicly stated that criminal groups have infiltrated the caravan. We also continue to see individuals from over 20 countries in this flow from countries such as Somalia, India, Haiti, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. There is a large segment of this population that we know nothing about and we must be prepared to defend our border and enforce our laws to protect the citizens of our country.\n\nThere are 26 crossing points on the southwest border from Texas to Arizona to California.

Critics would be wise to hold off criticizing President Trump\u2019s planned executive order focusing on illegal aliens until they see what is in it.\n\nEveryone is suddenly talking about the first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides, \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d\n\nSeveral pivotal moments in American history shine light on the meaning of those words.\n\nThe Supreme Court decided its most infamous case, Dred Scott, in 1857. John Sanford owned Scott as a piece of property. The Court held that black people were not U.S. citizens, and thus federal courts lacked jurisdiction to hear Scott\u2019s lawsuit challenging his status as a slave. Dred Scott marked a turning point on the issue of slavery, and four years afterward America descended into the Civil War.\n\nThe movie Lincoln recounts how, as he was leading the Union to victory in the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln pushed the Thirteenth Amendment through Congress to end slavery. It was a Republican-led effort, in which Lincoln the Republican peeled off just barely enough Democrats to get the requisite two-thirds in Congress to send the proposed amendment to the states for ratification.\n\nCongress proposed the Thirteenth Amendment to the states on January 31, 1865. On December 6, 1865, the necessary three-fourths of states voted to ratify the amendment, adding its words to the Constitution. Section 2 of that amendment authorized Congress to pass new legislation consistent with ending slavery.\n\nLawmakers invoked that authority just months after ratification, passing the Civil Rights Act of 1866 on April 9 of that year. That statute included a citizenship clause that provided, \u201cAll persons born in the United States, and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States.\u201d\n\nSome members of Congress like Rep. John Bingham (R-OH), who supported rights for newly freed blacks, nonetheless opposed the Civil Rights Act, explaining that they believed such legislation went beyond the authority granted by Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment to pass laws enforcing the end of slavery.\n\nThey argued instead that a new constitutional amendment was needed, and immediately drafted and pushed for congressional debate of a proposed Fourteenth Amendment. Key provisions from the Civil Rights Act were rewritten as part of the new draft amendment, including the Civil Rights Act\u2019s citizenship clause, but changing the words \u201cand not subject to any foreign power\u201d to \u201cand subject to the jurisdiction [of the United States].\u201d\n\nThe purpose of the Citizenship Clause was to supersede Dred Scott, securing citizenship for black Americans. The current debate is over how broadly Congress and the ratifying states acted when they amended the Constitution to undo Dred Scott\u2019s denial of citizenship.\n\nArticle I, Section 8, Clause 4 of the Constitution gives Congress plenary authority over immigration and naturalization, subject only to the additional restriction now imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nBut the Citizenship Clause is only a floor that Congress cannot go below. Congress can be as generous as it wants to concerning citizenship above that floor; lawmakers could pass a law granting citizenship to every person who ever enters this nation, or even to all 7 billion people on the planet.\n\nWhat exactly is the floor decreed by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Citizenship Clause?\n\nThe entire debate over birth citizenship turns on a single question: Did Congress change the meaning of \u201cnot subject to any foreign power\u201d in the Civil Rights Act when it substituted \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d in the Fourteenth Amendment, or was Congress merely using alternative words that meant the same thing?\n\nThe Congressional Globe \u2013 which was the authoritative source for congressional debates in the 1860s \u2013 only provides limited material, but enough to conclude that Congress was retaining the original meaning. There is no widespread discussion on the House or Senate floors to suggest that lawmakers thought they were adopting a different standard in the constitutional amendment than they had approved just months ago for the Civil Rights Act.\n\nTo the contrary, Sen. Lyman Trumbull (R-IL) \u2013 who was instrumental in shaping the language and getting the amendment through the Senate \u2013 said during debates that \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States meant subject to its \u201ccomplete\u201d jurisdiction. In other words: \u201cNot owing allegiance to anybody else.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Sen. Jacob Howard (R-MI), who introduced the language of the amendment\u2019s jurisdictional language on the floor of the Senate, insisted that the term should be construed to mean \u201ca full and complete jurisdiction,\u201d and \u201cthe same jurisdiction in extent and quality as applies to every citizen of the United States now\u201d (meaning now that the Civil Rights Act had been passed), except for Native Americans.\n\nOn that note, the Senate rejected a proposed change by Sen. James Doolittle (R-WI) to add back words to exclude \u201cIndians not taxed,\u201d to mirror the Civil Rights Act. But that idea to add the exclusion was rejected, because lawmakers concluded that Native Americans on reservations, even though on American soil \u2013 and thus subject to the jurisdiction of U.S. laws \u2013 where not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States in the political sense that the amendment used the term, and thus that the words about excluding them could be cut without changing the amendment\u2019s meaning.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment was voted out of Congress and sent to the states on June 13, 1866. It was ratified by the states two years later on July 9, 1868.\n\nThe first Supreme Court case discussing the Citizenship Clause was the Slaughter-House Cases of 1873, a mere five years later. Although Slaughter-House is routinely criticized today for its confusing ruling on the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Privileges or Immunities Clause \u2013 a separate provision that is completely irrelevant to birthright citizenship, so does not warrant further discussion here \u2013 the Court did make a clear statement about the Citizenship Clause.\n\nThe Court in Slaughter-House explained, \u201cthe phrase \u2018subject to the jurisdiction\u2019 was intended to exclude from [birthright citizenship] children of \u2026 citizens or subjects of foreign States born within the United States.\u201d That reading is completely consistent with the language of the Civil Rights Act of 1866.\n\nThe greatest constitutional scholar of the time, Thomas Cooley, agreed in his famous 1880 book, The General Principles of Constitutional Law. He wrote that \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d \u201cmeant full and complete jurisdiction to which citizens are generally subject, and not any qualified and partial jurisdiction, such as may consist with allegiance to some other government.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court directly ruled on the Citizenship Clause a decade after Slaughter-House in the 1884 case Elk v. Wilkins, where a Native American who was born on a reservation moved to Nebraska and attempted to register to vote. When he was denied voter registration because he was not a U.S. citizen, he filed suit.\n\nThe Court held that the Citizenship Clause did not guarantee John Elk birthright citizenship, because \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d means \u201cnot merely subject in some respect or degree to the jurisdiction of the United States, but completely subject to their political jurisdiction, and owing them direct and immediate allegiance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndian tribes, being within the territorial limits of the United States, were not, strictly speaking, foreign states,\u201d the Court continued, since U.S. law had jurisdiction reach there. Nonetheless, as their members were expected to owe part of their political allegiance to the tribes, \u201cthey were alien nations, distinct political communities,\u201d and thus not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Supreme Court elaborated that although John Elk and other Native Americans on reservations were:\n\nwithin the territorial limits of the United States, members of, and owing immediate allegiance to, one of the Indian tribes (an alien though dependent power), although in a geographical sense born in the United States, are no more \u201cborn in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,\u201d within the meaning of the first section of the fourteenth amendment, than the children of subjects of any foreign government born within the domain of that government, or the children born within the United States, of ambassadors or other public ministers of foreign nations.\n\nIn 1898, the Court might have departed from this original public meaning in United States v. Wong Kim Ark. The Court held, \u201ca child born in the United States, of parents of Chinese descent, who at the time of his birth were subjects of the emperor of China, but have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States,\u201d was, as a consequence of being born in the United States, a citizen of the United States under the Citizenship Clause.\n\nWong Kim Ark was the final Supreme Court case speaking directly to this issue. But even if the Court got that one wrong, it has no bearing on President Trump\u2019s executive action. Wong\u2019s parents were lawful permanent residents of the United States who had severed all ties and allegiance to China. President Trump is dealing here with illegal aliens only, not legal aliens. The Supreme Court would not need to overrule Wong Kim Ark to rule in favor of President Trump\u2019s action.\n\nThe only possible Supreme Court impediment is a footnote in one modern case, Plyler v. Doe. Written by arch-liberal Justice William Brennan in 1982, Plyler involved a Texas law denying free public-school education to the children of illegal aliens. The plaintiffs challenged that law under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause, which does not allow a state to deny \u201cequal protection of the laws\u201d to any person \u201cwithin its jurisdiction.\u201d (Note that \u201cwithin its jurisdiction\u201d is different wording than \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d in the Citizenship Clause.)\n\nIn footnote 10 of that decision, the stridently liberal Brennan inserted that \u201cno plausible distinction with respect to Fourteenth Amendment \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 can be drawn between resident aliens whose entry into the United States was lawful, and resident aliens whose entry was unlawful.\u201d\n\nPlyler was a 5-4 liberal decision. Not only did conservatives like Justice William Rehnquist dissent, but so did all the moderates, such as Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor. Modern conservative lawyers have looked for an opportunity to overrule Plyler and its footnote 10 for years, and now they may have an opportunity to do so.\n\nBecause the Citizenship Clause is a different Fourteenth Amendment provision than the Equal Protection Clause, it is also possible that the Court could rule in favor of President Trump without revisiting Plyler at all.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s imminent order could set up a test case both of the meaning of the Citizenship Clause, and critics should refrain from opining until they see what is in the expected executive order, lest they risk embarrassment.\n\nSome federal welfare programs are restricted for noncitizens. Foreigners are not eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or various other programs, even if they are in the U.S. legally, unless they have been here for many years. Illegal aliens are excluded from even more programs.\n\nPresident Trump could order the relevant departments and agencies not to enroll children born to illegal aliens into these programs, contending that they should not be regarded as U.S. citizens. That would likely spark a legal challenge, which would eventually reach the Supreme Court.\n\nOne unexpected issue here is the separation of powers question: How much can a president do under the Constitution and current federal law to address birthright citizenship, versus what matters need to be left to Congress? There is no question that only Congress can literally change a statute, but how much can a president do without new action by Congress?\n\nThe strength of the legal challenge will turn in part over what precisely the executive order commands, and in another part on this distinction between legislative and executive power. One would think that President Trump\u2019s opponents would have learned by now that they risk embarrassment when they cavalierly say that a president\u2019s actions are illegal; in Trump v. Hawaii, the Court upheld President Trump\u2019s travel ban as being authorized by Congress\u2019s current law, despite talking heads\u2019 smug assurances that the travel ban was blatantly illegal.\n\nPresident Trump has at least two routes to victory through a legal fight. It must be noted for both that a legal challenge to an executive order issued in November 2018 would almost certainly not make it all the way to petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court until after the cutoff in mid-January 2020 for cases to be decided before the presidential election, so this issue will likely still be pending when Americans go to the polls in November 2020 to vote for president.\n\nThe first route to victory is that the Supreme Court could hold that the specific provisions of the executive order are authorized under current statute. If so, President Trump wins outright.\n\nThe second is that the Court could hold that one or more of those provisions require congressional action, but could signal that the Constitution permits such changes. If so, there would be a massive push to tweak current statute. The American people will have been debating this issue for two full years by that time, and would by 2021 be educated by the Supreme Court\u2019s final decision as well. This could lay the groundwork, such that the same political momentum that would secure a second term for President Trump could also secure the votes to change the relevant provision of Congress\u2019s Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nAll this would be happening as the president continues to appoint federal judges who believe the Constitution must be interpreted according to its original public meaning. President Trump may well have a third Supreme Court vacancy before this matter is argued before the justices, securing even more a reliable originalist majority on the Court.\n\nPresident Trump has elevated a national discussion on an extraordinarily important issue that has been building for decades. He appears to be shaping the very battlefield on which he will fight, on a matter that tens of millions of voters care about deeply.\n\nKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

Claire McCaskill (D-MO), are fighting to hide their gun control support from constituents.\n\nOn October 29, 2018, Breitbart News reported undercover Project Veritas videos in which Sinema\u2019s admitted the numerous gun controls supported by the candidate but also made clear that Sinema could not discuss those controls until the election was over. We saw the same thing with McCaskill, whose staff praised her ability to hide her gun control support until after Missourians have all cast their votes.\n\nOnce the election is over everything changes, and a McCaskill field organizer described the Senator\u2019s openness to a \u201csemiautomatic rifle ban.\u201d\n\nAgain, if gun control is popular, why not run on a platform of banning semiautomatic rifles?\n\nOn July 11, 2018, Breitbart News reported that Congressional candidate Tedra Cobb (D-NY-21) admitted to supporting a ban on \u201cassault rifles\u201d but said she could not say so publicly because it would cost her the election.\n\nA cell phone video of Cobb speaking to a group of teens captured her making clear that Moms Demand Action had advised her not to admit her support of an \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban until after the election.\n\nHow can this be? After all, the mantra of Democrats and their surrogates in gun control groups and the establishment media has consistently been Americans want more gun control but Congress is standing in the way. If this true, why is Cobb hesitant to admit she wants to ban commonly owned semiautomatic firearms?\n\nHillary Clinton ran against gun rights in 2016 and lost to Donald Trump, who made defense of the Second Amendment a centerpiece in his campaign. If gun control is so popular, why did Clinton lose and and Trump win?\n\nOne last question\u2013Why do the few candidates who are pushing gun control go out their way to voice support for the Second Amendment?\n\nFor example, on June 18, 2018, Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) admitted gun control would not stop school shootings yet he went on to push more gun control anyway. Tester prefaced his gun control push by saying, \u201cThe Second Amendment is very important to me.\u201d\n\nIn summary, the Democrat machine, with all its surrogates, emerged from the December 14, 2012, attack on Sandy Hook Elementary assuring the nation Americans overwhelmingly supported more gun control. And not just control in general, but bans on whole categories of firearms, expansion of background checks, and new regulations on gun shows. Yet now, days before the American people decide who will control Congress for the next two years, Democrats have grown eerily silent on their plans to restrict the Second Amendment.\n\nJust consider Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), a gun control supporter who aligned himself with Barack Obama and Michael Bloomberg post-Sandy Hook. He pushed an expansion of gun control in the immediate aftermath the Sandy Hook attack, then spent the next four years trying to revive that push at every opportunity. But he is up for re-election now so he is running as pro-gun.\n\nWhy do Democrats hide or seek to minimize their gun control support when elections draw near?\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Beijing claims that terrorism is spilling over from Afghanistan into Xinjiang. But in reality, Chinese oppression and ethnic conflict in Xinjiang are helping to further destabilize Afghanistan and turn young Uighurs, increasingly targeted by the Chinese state, toward violent resistance.\n\nMuslim Uighur-majority Xinjiang, the largest province of China, borders Afghanistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.\n\nAfghanistan is a preferred destination for Uighurs seeking to escape ethnic and religious persecution, FP stressed, adding:\n\nIn light of the restrictions placed on Uighurs by authoritarian governments in Central Asia, war-torn Afghanistan has been the only neighboring country where it is politically and religiously safe for Uighurs to seek refuge, especially in Taliban-controlled areas.\n\nUighurs linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (ISIS) have threatened to attack China. The United States has designated Uighur jihadi groups like the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and the Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP), as foreign terrorist organizations. TIP has reportedly claimed responsibility for attacks inside of China.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s internal ethnic divisions, coupled with the vicissitudes of Afghan war and politics, have produced Uighur militant movements and resistance in Afghanistan, including some with connections to the Taliban and al Qaeda,\u201d FP noted.\n\nAccording to the U.S. government, China has forced hundreds of thousands of Uighurs accused of terrorist and separatist activities to internment camps, also known as re-education centers, established across Xinjiang.\n\nBeijing denies that it is detaining members of its Uighur minority, claiming they are willingly attending what it describes as \u201cvocational schools\u201d aimed at combating \u201cterrorism and religious extremism.\u201d\n\nThe camps are intended to ensure Uighurs practice their religion within the confines of the inherently atheist communist ideology.\n\nChina reportedly forces people to listen to propaganda at the facilities to ensure the worshippers remain loyal to the Communist Party.\n\nHuman rights group have long accused China of oppressing Uighurs.", "The top three spenders on political campaign Twitter advertisements are Democrat congressmen and senators, with Rep.

Recipients include close U.S. allies India, South Korea, and Japan, along with top American economic rival China.\n\nBloomberg News reported on Friday morning that details for China\u2019s waiver are still under negotiation. The four other countries that will be granted waivers were not identified by Bloomberg\u2019s sources, who said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will make a formal announcement later on Friday and all eight nations will be officially named on Monday.\n\nTurkey, which views Iran as a vital oil supplier and has enjoyed improved relations with the United States over the past few weeks, is a good guess for one of the remaining recipients.\n\nThe waivers are described as \u201ctemporary\u201d and conditioned on the eight countries steadily reducing Iranian oil imports while they are in effect. Details such as how much Iranian oil the recipients can buy and how long the waivers will last were not disclosed. For comparison, Bloomberg recalled the Obama administration granting 20 waivers to Iran sanctions before the nuclear deal lifted them, and those waivers specified import reductions of about 20 percent over six months.\n\nThe waivers granted by the Trump administration will come with some important restrictions designed to ensure the money from oil purchases is not abused by Iran to finance terrorism and military operations across the Middle East:\n\nCountries that get waivers under the revived sanctions must pay for the oil into escrow accounts in their local currency. That means the money won\u2019t directly go to Iran, which can only use it to buy food, medicine or other non-sanctioned goods from its crude customers. The administration sees those accounts as an important way of limiting Iranian revenue and further constraining its economy. \u201cIt\u2019s a virtual certainty that Western banks are not going to violate the escrow restrictions,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies who has advised Pompeo. \u201cThe message they\u2019re sending is don\u2019t screw around with these escrow accounts and try to get cute.\u201d\n\nChina, India, South Korea, and Japan are among the top customers for Iranian oil, as is Turkey, if it does indeed receive a waiver. The Chinese have eagerly anticipated India, South Korea, and Japan turning away from the United States if they were not granted waivers to purchase Iranian oil.\n\nGranting exemptions to nearly all the top buyers of Iranian oil will naturally raise criticism that the Trump administration is backing away from its stated desire to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero.\n\nSecretary Pompeo restated that objective as recently as September, although his much-quoted statement about America\u2019s \u201cexpectations\u201d came in the context of explaining why waivers could still be granted to countries like India:\n\nWe have told the Indians consistently, as we have told every nation, that on November 4th the sanctions with respect to Iranian crude oil will be enforced, and that we will consider waivers where appropriate, but that it is our expectation that the purchases of Iranian crude oil will go to zero from every country, or sanctions will be imposed. So we\u2019ll work with the Indians. We committed that we would do that. Many countries are in a place where they \u2013 it takes a little bit of time to unwind, and we\u2019ll work with them, I am sure, to find an outcome that makes sense. And from whence they purchase the other crude oil, we\u2019re happy to see if it\u2019s American products that are able to deliver for them. I think that\u2019d be a great outcome. But our mission set is to make sure that Iran doesn\u2019t engage in malign behavior with wealth that comes from countries around the world, thus the purpose of the sanctions.\n\nThe waivers described by Bloomberg\u2019s sources are consistent with the strategy Pompeo described, acknowledging that \u201cit takes a little bit of time to unwind\u201d by giving the eight recipients more time to scale down their Iranian oil purchases. The escrow system for oil money should satisfy Pompeo\u2019s mission statement that Iran must not be allowed to \u201cengage in malign behavior\u201d with its wealth.\n\nIn fact, the escrow accounts might do the regime in Tehran a favor by obliging it to spend more money on the welfare of its people instead of financing foreign wars, a top complaint of protesters in Iran. Sadly, Iran\u2019s leadership is unlikely to thank the Trump administration for helping it to achieve spending discipline at last.\n\nThe waivers were nevertheless criticized immediately as the Trump administration backing away from its zero-export goals. Olivier Jakob of the consulting firm Petromatrix told Reuters on Friday that eight waivers is \u201cmuch higher than anybody expected.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite the tough talk, the issuance of so many waivers provides a lifeline to Iran,\u201d Jakob said.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s report included oil price data from the past month that suggests the last-minute waivers are what everyone expected, more or less. Oil prices have been falling steadily instead of rising in a panicked crescendo, as one might expect them to do if a major supplier was about to disappear from the market overnight.\n\nThe expectation appears to have been something along the lines of a gradual reduction after November 5, coupled with increased exports from other countries to balance the loss of Iranian oil, which has already dropped from 2.7 million to 1.6 million barrels per day since the United States withdrew from the nuclear deal. In a happy coincidence for Americans, the newly-crowned top oil producer in the world is the United States.\n\nIranian oil sales are down 37 percent since President Donald Trump announced sanctions would be imposed. The disruption in the oil markets on November 5 is still expected to be the largest since Libyan production was choked off by its civil war, although the cushioning effect of increased production from other producers and the new waivers is difficult to calculate. Analysts expect Iranian exports will fall below the previous low of 1 million barrels per day achieved under pre-nuclear-deal sanctions in 2012.", "Friday, MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d discussed the GOP\u2019s midterm numbers heading into next week\u2019s election despite President Donald Trump\u2019s rally efforts.\n\nHost Joe Scarborough noted how Rep.

The U.S. added 250,000 Jobs in October \u2026 Unemployment at 3.7%. Wages UP! These are incredible numbers. Keep it going, Vote Republican!\n\nThe good news came in the scheduled agency report about the October economy. Breitbart News reported:\n\nWage growth, long considered the \u2018missing ingredient\u2019 to the economic expansion, has finally returned. Average hourly earnings climbed by five cents an hour for the month, or 83 cents year-over-year. That represents a 3.1 percent gain, the first time wages have grown more than 3 percent year-over-year.\n\nWow! The U.S. added 250,000 Jobs in October \u2013 and this was despite the hurricanes. Unemployment at 3.7%. Wages UP! These are incredible numbers. Keep it going, Vote Republican! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 2, 2018\n\nThe Friday data echoed good news in an earlier Nov. 1 report about the economy\u2019s performance in the summer months. Breitbart News reported:\n\nWage hikes are accelerating. Hourly compensation rose at a 3.5 percent rate the July through September period, up from the 1.9 percent pace in the spring.\n\nProductivity also showed sustained growth in the summer months. That is important because rising productivity produces the rising wealth which is divided among employees and investors:\n\nProductivity climbed at a 2.2 percent annual pace in the three months from July to September, a government report released Thursday showed. That was in line with economists\u2019 expectations. Productivity was revised up a notch to a 3 percent annual rate for the second quarter.\n\nThe 2018 wage-raises are putting Trump in an excellent position to win the 2020 election while his immigration policies are hindering the arrival of cheaper illegal-workers and also of legal visa-workers. Trump\u2019s curbs on the labor supply are forcing CEOs to compete for workers by offering higher wages.\n\nA new report by economist Michael Strain, an economist at the corporate-friendly American Enterprise Institute, showed the highest pay gains among the people hit hardest by illegal immigration under President George W. Bush and Barack Obama:\n\nAmerican college-grads have also gained, partly because Trump\u2019s deputies have blocked business demand for more white-collar visa workers. That trend may help Trump rebuild support among college-graduate voters, but investor demand for cheaper college-grads is growing more strident.\n\nFor example, the 2019 budget bill for the Department of Homeland Security includes several measures to dramatically expand visa-worker programs, includes a \u201ccountry caps\u201d measure that would allow U.S. companies to outsource more Americans\u2019 jobs to Indian graduate visa-workers. The H.R. 392 bill is backed by GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder, who is lagging in his race against a far-left Democratic candidate.\n\nNationwide, more than 1.5 million white-collar jobs are held by foreign college-graduates because of the various H-1B, L-1 and OPT visa-programs established by Bush, Obama, and Congress. That huge foreign workforce pushes down possible salary gains for American college graduates and postgraduates.\n\nEstablishment media outlets increasingly recognize that Trump\u2019s high-pressure/low-migration economy is forcing up wages. The Washington Post admitted Oct. 31:\n\nU.S. workers are seeing the largest nominal wage increase in a decade, the Labor Department reported Wednesday, as companies compete harder for employees than they did in recent years. \u2026 \u201cWages are grinding higher as the labor market continues to tighten,\u201d said Justin Weidner, an economist at Deutsche Bank. \u201cWage growth is likely to be over 3 percent again soon.\u201d\n\nA Washington Post report said Nov. 2:\n\nthe typical worker\u2019s earnings rose by 3.1 percent over the year that ended in October, the biggest leap since 2009. \u201cThis is the best labor environment in over a decade,\u201d said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, an international consulting firm. \u2026 \u201cAverage wages are finally starting to pick up, especially for some lower-skilled positions,\u201d Chamberlain said. \u201cMaintenance workers, bank tellers, cashiers, cooks \u2014 employers are running out of workers for many of these roles.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times noted:\n\nThe number of adults not in the labor force at all fell by 487,000. And employers evidently needed to pay higher wages to coax these workers off the sidelines. Long the soft underbelly of this expansion, average hourly earnings are now up 3.1 percent over the last year, from 2.8 percent in the previous reading. Put it together, and this is the best time for the American labor market in at least 18 years and maybe closer to 50 \u2014 though it would be nice to see sustained wage growth substantially higher than inflation, not just in a single month, before making any comparisons to the boom of the late 1960s.\n\nThe shortage of workers is also helping sidelined Americans get back into the job market, the New York Times said:\n\nThe proportion of prime-working-age adults \u2014 those between 25 and 54 \u2014 who were working in October soared to 79.7 percent, up from 79.3 percent in September and easily the highest of this expansion.\n\nThe rising wages are boosting Trump\u2019s political support. The New York Times reported one anecdote from Ohio:\n\nA short walk away, [union organizer Russ] Brode approached Michael Birch, 39, perched on a roof grinding sandstone for a chimney repair. Was he interested in hearing about some fine folks running for office? \u201cAre they Republicans?\u201d asked Mr. Birch, a union bricklayer. No? Then he was not interested. Mr. Brode turned to leave, brushing past a truck with a sticker on the back window: \u201cMaking America great again,\u201d it read, \u201cone brick at a time.\u201d\n\nThe other side of Trump\u2019s high-pressure/low-migration economy is a reduction of the wealth gaps are investors are forced to share their profits with empowered employees. CNBC reported Oct. 16 that:\n\nLarry Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc. (BLK \u2013 Get Report) , the world\u2019s largest money manager, pointed to the trend in an Oct. 16 interview with CNBC. \u201cCompanies are having margin pressures because of rising wages, which may be a good thing for the overall economy, but not as good for corporate profitability,\u201d Fink told the network.\n\nThat is a big shift from Obama\u2019s tenure. Obama\u2019s decision to spike immigration shifted many billions of dollars from voters\u2019 pockets over to Wall Street. His easy-migration policies pushed legal and illegal immigration to a record level of 1.75 million in 2016 by accepting one migrant for every two young Americans who entered the workforce in 2016. The huge inflow matched the record set in 1999 when Bill Clinton was president.\n\nObama\u2019s wave of legal immigrants, illegal migrants, and visa workers rose from 1.1 million in 2009 to 1.75 million in 2017. In the same year, roughly four million Americans turned 18 and joined the workforce. The four million Americans included the children of immigrants as well as the children of illegal migrants.\n\nWashington\u2019s economic policy of using migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe policy also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids\u2019 schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.\n\nImmigration also pulls investment and wealth away from heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations living in the coastal states.", "Pro-migration lawyers have recruited several Honduran caravan migrants to demand judges block President Donald Trump\u2019s asylum reforms, due for release next week.\n\n\u201cNOW COMES Plaintiffs Maria Doris Pineda, Jasmine Ortega Sanchez, Francisco Javier Castillos, Holivia Adeline Castillos, Dina Ruc, and Marta Lopez, and file this civil action against the Trump administration for violations of their procedural and substantive due process rights,\u201d says the lawsuit by DC-based John M. Shoreman, plus three additional lawyers in Atlanta, Mario B. Williams, Julie Oinonen, and Dallas S. LePierre.\n\nThe Nov. 1 lawsuit admits that the migrants are not in the United States, but are \u201ctravelling [sic] by foot to the United States to seek asylum.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and is so rushed that it targets Thomas Homan, the retired former acting Director of ICE. \u201cDefendant Thomas Homan is sued in his official capacity as the Director of ICE,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nThe lawsuit focuses on presidential statements and various predictions, but not on regulations and instructions issued by the federal government. It claims:\n\nTrump\u2019s professed and enacted policy towards thousands of caravanners seeking asylum in the United States is shockingly unconstitutional. President Trump continues to abuse the law, including constitutional rights, to deter Central Americans from exercising their lawful right to seek asylum in the United States\n\nThe new rules and regulations are expected next week. They likely include a rule ending the Flores judicial commandment which forces border agencies to release migrants who bring children before the courts can process their asylum claims.\n\nThe lawsuit demands that the federal government allow the migrants to plead for asylum, but there is no evidence that President Donald Trump intends to prevent the migrants from asking for asylum. In his Nov. 1 press conference, Trump did not promise to bar asylum applications by the caravan migrants, but promised that he would detain migrants until their claims are heard:\n\nUnder this plan, the illegal aliens will no longer get a free pass into our country by lodging meritless claims in seeking asylum. Instead, migrants seeking asylum will have to present themselves lawfully at a port of entry. So they\u2019re going to have to lawfully present themselves at a port of entry. Those who choose to break our laws and enter illegally will no longer be able to use meritless claims to gain automatic admission into our country. We will hold them \u2014 for a long time, if necessary.\n\nTrump argued that his reforms would end the catch-and-release policies set by former President Barack Obama and by Congress:\n\nThe biggest loophole drawing illegal aliens to our borders is the use of fraudulent or meritless asylum claims to gain entry into our great country. An alien simply crosses the border illegally, finds a Border Patrol agent, and using well-coached language \u2014 by lawyers and others that stand there trying to get fees or whatever they can get \u2014 they\u2019re given a phrase to read \u2026 then often released into the United States, and they await a lengthy court process. The court process will takes years sometimes for them to attend. Well, we\u2019re not releasing them into our country any longer. \u2026 On average, once released, an asylum case takes three and half years to complete. Think of it. Somebody walks into our country, reads a statement given by a lawyer, and we have a three-and-a-half-year court case for one person. \u2026 The overwhelming majority of claims are rejected by the courts, but by that time, the alien has usually long since disappeared into our country. So they never get to see the judge. They never get to have a ruling. They don\u2019t care because they\u2019re in the country and nobody knows where they are.\n\nTrump noted that asylum law does not accept poverty as a cause for granting asylum:\n\nAsylum is not a program for those living in poverty. There are billions of people in the world living at the poverty level. The United States cannot possibly absorb them all. Asylum is a very special protection intended only for those fleeing government persecution based on race, religion, and other protected status.\n\n\u201cThis complaint is poorly written and looks more like a press release than a lawsuit, using politically charged terms and hyperbole instead of carefully reasoned legal claims,\u201d says Breitbart News Senior Legal Editor Ken Klukowski.\n\n\u201cThis case is not ripe for adjudication, but regardless, if President Trump issues a presidential proclamation denying entry to this class of aliens, then Supreme Court precedent makes clear Congress has given him the legal authority to do so,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the lawsuit indicates several legal claims that are likely to be made by establishment pro-migration groups, such as the ACLU.\n\nFor example, it says that migrants can only be detained in camp cities which are licensed and overseen by state-approved oversight groups:\n\nthe Flores Agreement, a legally binding agreement designed to ensure the safety of immigrant alien children, as they enter this country for a variety of reasons, states that minors must be held in facilities run by licensed programs that are \u201csafe and sanitary and are consistent with [Defendants\u2019] concern for the particular vulnerability of minors.\u201d \u2026 These facilities must \u201cprovide access to toilets and sinks, drinking water \u2026 adequate temperature control and ventilation, adequate supervision to protect minors from others, and contact with family. \u2026 President Trump\u2019s policy position/initiative is to put these very children in tents, touting that \u201cwhen they find out this happens, [held in tents for years in the desert] you\u2019re going to have far fewer people come up.\u201d Clearly President Trump cannot believe that his tents are facilities run by licensed programs as required by the Flores Agreements. And President Trump clearly is not talking about adequate temperature controlled and ventilated tents with toilets and sinks and drinking water, for Plaintiffs\u2019 children, noting that Trump has condoned tent encampments as recent as 8 months ago.\n\nThe lawsuit is here.", "The Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl about nine months ago.

This forced the government to shut down mobile phone networks and keep schools closed to protect children.\n\nThe country\u2019s Supreme Court acquitted Bibi of her death sentence for \u201cblasphemy\u201d on Wednesday, citing a lack of evidence. Bibi reportedly remains in an undisclosed location for her safety. Hardline Islamists, many of them of the radical Tehreek-e-Labaik Party (TLP), are demanding her death, the death of her family, and the death of the justices who acquitted her. Some have also demanded the killing of Prime Minister Imran Khan for urging the mobs to stay home and stop paralyzing the nation.\n\nOn Friday, Reuters reported that the government had suspended mobile phone networks in at least Lahore and capital Islamabad in an attempt to keep radical Islamist groups from calling more people to join the riots. Reuters confirmed that the government ordered the shutdown, rather than heavy usage slowing the networks to a halt.\n\nReuters also confirmed the government had shut down schools near the most violent crowds.\n\nThe Pakistani newspaper Dawn later confirmed the mobile shutdown was temporary and phone services had returned to the two cities at press times. Schools, on the other hand, appear to be individually choosing whether or not to open, particularly private schools. Many private school networks have already announced they are not to open Friday or Saturday; some are opening Saturday to make up for closing Friday.\n\nPakistan, in the midst of an educational crisis, is suspected to keep up to 20 million children out of school. Many of the nation\u2019s poor choose to send their children to Islamic schools that teach hardline political Islamism, a better option than no school at all, they argue. Wealthier Pakistanis can avail themselves of private schools, many of which are run by Christian groups, making them a target for protests.\n\nDawn\u2018s coverage of the ongoing protests suggests that Asia Bibi has become a catalyst for broader concerns among the radical Islamic groups, which photos show appear to be made up exclusively of men.

Pakistan\u2019s penal code requires a death penalty for individuals found guilty of disparaging Muhammad in any way. Bibi maintained her innocent, however, and spent eight years on death row and nine in prison.\n\nThe Supreme Court found insufficient evidence that Bibi committed the crime in question. In its decision and a concurring opinion, the justices argued that not only was Bibi innocent, but that her accusers had committed blasphemy by lying about the charges.\n\nBibi reportedly remains behind bars at press time, both because the court needs to finalize her acquittal and because her life runs grave danger should she be allowed in public without security.

Twenty-one thousand of the new manufacturing goods were in durable goods manufacturing, including more than 10 thousand in transportation manufacturing. More than 6,000 new jobs were added in autos and auto parts. Nearly 5,000 jobs were added by makers of machinery.\n\nOctober is not typically a strong month for manufacturing jobs. In fact, the U.S. has not created this many manufacturing jobs in October since 1998, according to Department of Labor data.

That far exceeded expectations of 190,000.\n\nThe strong growth of manufacturing comes after widespread predictions that trade disputes and tariffs on metals would weigh on domestic manufacturing. Instead, domestic manufacturing is booming.\n\nThe job growth in autos and machinery, heavy users of the tariffed steel and aluminum, indicate these have not been hit by the tariffs. Machinery manufacturing employment is up 4.5 percent from a year ago, outpacing the rate of growth for the broader economy. Transportation manufacturing jobs have grown by 3.6 percent.\n\nFabricated metals manufacturing jobs are up 3.6 percent from a year ago.

For the month, however, this category shed 100 jobs, a decline of 0.1 percent, on a seasonally adjusted basis.\n\nAlthough the forecast job losses due to metals tariffs have not occurred, there are signs that U.S. tariffs on China are adding to jobs.

But she rejected any suggestion of concerted efforts by civil servants to undermine ministers. \u201cIt is about a specific set of circumstances involving a small number of individuals,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is nothing to suggest such issues are widespread across either the department or the civil service.\u201d\n\nThis denial is not convincing.\n\nI have it on good authority that one of the main reasons Theresa May has been able to remain Prime Minister so long, despite being so singularly useless at the job, is that she has forged a devil\u2019s pact with the civil service.\n\nThe Civil Service gets to police all her cabinet ministers \u2013 spying on their every move, like the Stasi; watering down their speeches; nipping in the bud anything that looks remotely like disloyalty or a leadership bid. In return, Theresa May allows herself to be run like the Civil Service\u2019s puppet.\n\nTheresa May\u2019s government, in other words, is essentially a willing prisoner of the Deep State.\n\nThe politics of Whitehall \u2013 Europhile, politically correct, Nanny Statist \u2013 are far to the left of the cabinet and even further to the left of the Conservative grassroots. Yet because these jumped up civil servants have been given carte blanche by the Prime Minister herself to run the show, ministers and MPs are powerless to fight back.\n\nStill to his credit, as reported in the Guardian, Rudd\u2019s replacement Sajid Javid is having a good go:\n\nAmid wider turmoil at the Home Office, a review into whether the department had been fair and humane in its approach to immigration has been announced by Rudd\u2019s successor, Sajid Javid. There have been reports that Javid\u2019s move has been resisted by Downing Street because of concerns that his plans for a broad investigation could shine an unwelcome light on May\u2019s time as home secretary.\n\nDowning Street can resist all it likes. It\u2019s not as though the current incumbent is going to be there much longer. I give the woman six months, max. She\u2019s never going to survive it once whatever useless Brexit plan she has finally managed to cobble together with her Remainer civil servants gets voted down by parliament.", "MONTERREY, Nuevo Leon \u2013 Authorities in this border state arrested the driver for a cartel hit squad who was identified as a murder suspect in Colorado.\n\nThe arrest was part of an ongoing investigation into a hit squad run by a faction of Los Zetas called Cartel Del Noreste that, as Cartel Chronicles reported, was targeting state police officers throughout Monterrey. Using a series of ambush attacks, CDN managed to kill and injure several Nuevo Leon state police officers to pressure officials into stopping cartel crackdowns.\n\nState authorities arrested 27-year-old Miguel Angel \u201cEl Gordo\u201d Hernandez Moran along with 5 CDN hitmen hiding at a house in Apodaca.\n\nThe CDN is tied to several kidnapping and extortion cases dealing with the local sale of drugs in and around Monterrey. During the operation, authorities were able to identify one of the alleged gunmen as 29-year-old Jaime Joshimar Zavala Santana, who has since been named as one of the suspects in the ambush that killed Nuevo Leon State Police Officer Luis Ricardo Morales Gonzalez.\n\nAs part of the investigation, authorities learned that Hernandez Moran, who is a native of Nayarit, is wanted in Colorado Springs, Colorado, for the 2012 kidnapping and murder of Jeremy Naranjo. Hernandez Moran fled to Mexico where he claimed to be working as a taxi driver, however authorities accused him of working for the CDN.", "Ahead of the November midterm elections, Breitbart News has decided to highlight some of the security and influence concerns surrounding the social media giant Facebook.\n\nAs the November midterm elections draw close, social media firm Facebook has begun attempting to crack down on \u201cmisinformation\u201d on the platform as well as focusing on platform security, an area which its had issues with recently. Breitbart News has compiled a list of a number of ways in which Facebook\u2019s issues could affect the November midterm elections.\n\n1: Impersonation of Politicians and Political Groups\n\nOne issue that Facebook is now facing is in their \u201cPaid For\u201d feature on political advertisements, initially designed to provide more clarity around who was funding political advertising on the platform, the feature has caused more confusion as it can be easily manipulated.\n\nA recent report from Vice News showed how easily Facebook\u2019s new political advertising tools can be manipulated with little to no verification by Facebook. The social media giant added a mandatory \u201cPaid For\u201d disclosure to political ads in May, which aimed to provide further clarity to the origin of political advertisements on the website. Instead, it appears that this mandatory field can be used to spread misinformation.\n\nVice first successfully placed ads on Facebook using the name of a number of prominent political figures and groups including Vice President Mike Pence, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, and even the terrorist group ISIS. All of these ads were approved by Facebook with the names of these political figures and groups included within the \u201cPaid For\u201d disclosure.\n\nNow Vice News has shown once again how easily the political advertising system can be fooled, this time by posing as all 100 U.S. senators and successfully running advertisements indicating they were \u201cpaid for\u201d by each senator.\n\n2: Facebook\u2019s Election War Room\n\nIn an attempt to prepare themselves for the midterm elections, Facebook has developed a \u201cWar Room\u201d to try and deal with election-related issues as they arise. An article published in the New York Times titled \u201cInside Facebook\u2019s Election \u2018War Room\u2019\u201d gives a unique insight into Facebook\u2019s preparations ahead of upcoming elections. The article begins by describing Facebook\u2019s War Room and explaining it\u2019s use by the company:\n\n\n\nAlthough it is not much to look at now, as of next week the space will be Facebook\u2019s headquarters for safeguarding elections. More than 300 people across the company are working on the initiative, but the War Room will house a team of about 20 focused on rooting out disinformation, monitoring false news and deleting fake accounts that may be trying to influence voters before elections in the United States, Brazil and other countries. \u201cWe see this as probably the biggest companywide reorientation since our shift from desktops to mobile phones,\u201d said Samidh Chakrabarti, who leads Facebook\u2019s elections and civic engagement team. The company, he added, \u201chas mobilized to make this happen.\u201d\n\nWith Chakrabarti stating that the company \u201cmobilized to make this happen,\u201d it would appear that Facebook is taking the issue of election integrity quite seriously, likely spurred on by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s appearance before Congress.\n\nThe article further describes how the War Room works stating:\n\nThe War Room is a \u201cproactive\u201d way to build systems in anticipation of attacks, Greg Marra, a product manager working on Facebook\u2019s News Feed, said in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. One of the tools the company is introducing is custom software that helps track information flowing across the social network in real time, said Mr. Chakrabarti, who joined Facebook about four years ago from Google. These dashboards resemble a set of line and bar graphs, with statistics that provide a view into how activity on the platform is changing. They allow employees to zero in on, say, a specific false news story in wide circulation or a spike in automated accounts being created in a particular geographic area.\n\nHowever, the War Room could easily become a weaponized tool by Facebook if they choose to attempt to shift votes in a certain direction, this could be done by simply stopping the spread of certain information or deleting or removing entire accounts or pages. These practices can be seen in the next point\n\n3: Shutting Down Political Dissidents\n\nFacebook recently blacklisted accounts and pages from the \u201cmain network of support\u201d for right-wing Brazilian Presidential Candidate Jair Bolsonaro less than a week before Brazil\u2019s runoff election recently. Reuters reported that Facebook shut down 68 pages and 43 accounts linked to the Brazilian marketing group Raposo Fernandes Associados (RFA) for violating the website\u2019s rules related to spam.\n\nThe Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo has claimed that the marketing group has been one of the biggest support networks for right-wing Brazilian Presidential Candidate Jair Bolsonaro. Facebook said that RFA created Facebook pages using multiple accounts or fake accounts with the same name and posted multiple clickbait style links which lead to \u201cad-farming\u201d websites.\n\nFacebook said in a statement: \u201cOur decision to remove these pages was based on the behavior of these actors \u2013 including using fake accounts and repeatedly posting spam \u2013 rather than on the type of content they were posting.\u201d\n\nFacebook has claimed that the removal of RFA\u2019s pages and accounts had been part of the many actions they have taken \u201cto prevent bad actors from interfering with Brazil\u2019s elections on Facebook.\u201d Brazils leftist presidential contender, Fernando Haddad of the Workers Party, has claimed that the Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp was being used to spread spam and misinformation surrounding the election.\n\nWhile many may think that such actions would never be taken in the United States, Facebook recently blacklisted the right-wing group called the Proud Boys and their founder Gavin McInnes.\n\nBusiness Insider reported recently that Facebook banned Gavin McInnes, along with certain accounts linked to the Proud Boys, the organization founded by McInnes. On Tuesday, social media users began reporting that accounts linked to members of the group were being removed from Facebook, now the company has confirmed that they are banning accounts linked to the Proud Boys and Gavin McInnes from Facebook and Instagram, citing the platform\u2019s rules against hate groups as its reason for doing so.\n\nFacebook reportedly told Business Insider:\u201cOur team continues to study trends in organized hate and hate speech and works with partners to better understand hate organizations as they evolve. We ban these organizations and individuals from our platforms and also remove all praise and support when we become aware of it. We will continue to review content, Pages, and people that violate our policies, take action against hate speech and hate organizations to help keep our community safe.\u201d\n\n4: Mark Zuckerberg Has Vowed to Crack Down on \u201cHate Speech\u201d\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated recently that the upcoming U.S. midterm elections will be \u201ca real test\u201d of the company\u2019s ability to crack down on \u201chate speech\u201d and misinformation.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter stated in a recent article that Facebook will make its biggest increase in money spent to combat \u201chate speech\u201d and misinformation on its platform this year, according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg stated that despite Facebook\u2019s increased expenditure, the company still won\u2019t be as \u201cdialed in as well as everyone would like us to be,\u201d in relation to security and influence campaigns on the platform.\n\nZuckerberg stated that the upcoming midterm elections will be \u201ca real test\u201d of the newly implemented safeguards designed to protect the platform from \u201cbad actors,\u201d following reports of numerous foreign influence campaigns on the social media website. Zuckerberg said that during the upcoming election, the platform will see \u201call the good and bad that humanity can do,\u201d but that the social media platform is getting better at hiding the \u201cbad stuff\u201d from users.\n\nZuckerberg stated that the social media firm will \u201cnever be perfect\u201d at safeguarding users data \u2014 an issue that Facebook has had extensive problems with over the past year. The CEO stated that there is no \u201csilver bullet\u201d that would fix the issue of user data leaks.\n\n5: User Data Vulnerabilities\n\nFacebook has faced numerous user data leaks and breaches over the past year, from the Cambridge Analytica scandal in March which saw the personal details of 87 million Facebook users left exposed to the company\u2019s most recent data breach in October which the company claims was nearly undetectable. During an Advertising Week panel in October Facebook\u2019s vice president of global marketing solutions, Carolyn Everson, explained that the company\u2019s latest user data breach which affected the accounts of 50 million people was a \u201csophisticated attack.\u201d Everson stated: \u201cThis was an attack, an attack that would require people to understand three different bugs.\u201d\n\nEverson further said that the attackers were like an \u201codorless, weightless intruder that walked in\u201d that could only be detected by Facebook \u201conce they made a certain move.\u201d The security bug reportedly related to a vulnerability in Facebook\u2019s \u201cview as\u201d feature which allowed users to see what their own Facebook profile would look like to someone else. This bug allowed hackers to steal the security tokens of other users accounts and use these to then access that user\u2019s account. These security tokens are like digital keys which keep users logged into Facebook so they don\u2019t have to re-login every time they visit the website.\n\nIt later came to light that the same security tokens could be used to access accounts of websites that use the \u201cFacebook Login\u201d feature. This means that any third-party app that uses the \u201cFacebook Login\u201d feature could be at risk, including apps such as Instagram, Tinder, Airbnb and many others. Guy Rosen, Facebook\u2019s vice president of product management, stated in the blog post revealing the bug: \u201cThe vulnerability was on Facebook, but these access tokens enabled someone to use the account as if they were the account-holder themselves.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the rise in user data leaks, Everson stated: \u201cThis is the most significant cultural shift: Recognizing our responsibility, taking very specific actions and doing everything we can.\u201d Everson also discussed WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton\u2019s recent critical remarks about Facebook stating that she\u2019d like to \u201chear more about their philanthropy.\u201d The also described the recent departure of Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger as a \u201cvery, very friendly and cordial departure.\u201d\n\nAll of these problems pose significant threats during the upcoming election given the influence that Facebook seems to have in the modern world. Breitbart News readers should continue to stay alert on social media and watch out for suspicious activity leading up to the election.", "San Francisco 49ers running back Raheem Mostert suffered a shocking arm injury during Thursday\u2019s game, after his arm bent the wrong way as he fell to the turf.\n\nMostert was attempting to run the ball up the middle in the third quarter when he went down. But according to video of the play, it appears that when he tried to stop his fall, his right arm snapped the wrong way, Fox News reported.\n\nEvery player around him from both teams immediately stopped what they were doing as the player writhed in pain on the field.\n\nVideo shows a number of player\u2019s faces in deep concern and discomfort over the injury.\n\nThe 49ers reported that Mostert broke his arm and is now out for the season. He finished with 86 rushing yards, seven carries, and one touchdown.\n\nThe 49ers finished the game with a 34-3 win over the Oakland Raiders.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) is taking on the nation\u2019s elite colleges over alleged discrimination against Asian-American students.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned \u2026 that Harvard University and some of the other major universities have slipped back into an unacceptable practice of discrimination against Asian-American kids even though they had best scores,\u201d he told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Thursday.\n\n\u201cDespite meeting the criteria for admissions, they ended up being rejected because [the colleges] wanted less of an Asian-American presence. That\u2019s called racial discrimination, and we can\u2019t accept it.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Rohrabacher held an event devoted to the issue at the Vietnam War Memorial at Freedom Park in Westminster, a key landmark for the local South Vietnamese community.\n\nIn a statement, he said: \u201cThe admissions process at our colleges and universities should be color-blind and ethnically neutral. Standards that unfairly discriminate against one race or ethnicity must be eradicated.\n\n\u201cIt is unconstitutional, illegal, and just plain wrong for educational institutions to have admissions policies based on race,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cThe supposed benevolent intent of promoting diversity is no excuse for blatant race-based decisions which are unfair and cause great harm to Asian-American children.\u201d\n\nRohabacher noted that he had also sent a letter to Secretary of Educaton Betsy DeVos asking for a meeting about what her department was doing to address the subject. (The Department of Justice has already weighed in in favor of a current lawsuit against Harvard.)\n\nHe told Breitbart on Thursday that in his meeting with DeVos, \u201cwe will holler and scream until we get something done.\u201d\n\nRohrabacher is in a tough re-election fight in the 48th congressional district. His opponent, Harley Rouda, is a former Republican who has criticized Rohrabacher\u2019s support for better relations with Russia.\n\nRouda is backed by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, a former New York City mayor who now supports gun control and climate change activism, and who is committed to helping Democrats win the house.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up against a New York liberal billionaire,\u201d Rohrabacher told Breitbart News, saying that he had been outspent ten-to-one. But he was not worried, he said: \u201cMy people are smart enough to see a power play.\u201d\n\nIn a recent debate on local television, Rohrabacher hit Rouda over his support for Medicare for illegal aliens. Footage later emerged of Rouda threatening to quit the debate because Rohrabacher was using notes. The moderator, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Rick Reiff, looked unimpressed by Rouda and his staff.\n\nRohrabacher said that there were two closing messages in his campaign. \u201cOne is that if, indeed, Democrats get control of the House, any of the efforts our presence is making to get control of our border and stop the massive flow if illegal immigration into our country \u2014 that whole effort will just flounder and end.\u201d\n\nThe other message, he said, is that Democrats \u201cwill give us two years of the worst type of negative, hate-filled politics, where they try to obstruct our president and impeach him. America doesn\u2019t need that kind of turmoil.\u201d\n\nHe speculated that Democrats had been relying on younger voters, who had been \u201ctaught by their professors exactly the wrong things about how a democratic system can work and how an economy can function.\u201d\n\nOne issue where Rohrabacher had managed to reach those younger voters has been his long-standing support for the legalization of marijuana. He recently accompanied senior citizens from his district to a marijuana dispensary nearby.\n\n\u201cCannabis should be left to state and local government, not the federal government,\u201d he told Breitbart News. \u201cA federal police force (the Drug Enforcement Administration) conducting raids far from D.C. is not what our Founding Fathers had in mind.\u201d\n\nHe cited the positive medical uses of marijuana: \u201cNow, research that\u2019s been done on cannabis \u2014 finally, after they suppressed research all these years \u2014 [shows] things that alleviate pain, [and] bring back appetite. Our veterans who are coming back from war say cannabis helps prevent seizures, and gets them off opioids.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cI think marijuana has helped me for about 10% of the vote \u2014 and not just among young people.\u201d\n\nA poll released Friday shows Rohrabacher with his first statistically significant lead in recent months.\n\nJoel B.

boycott-promoting and anti-police Dream Defenders organization a \u201cMovement Building Partner Award.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Breitbart News documented that, until last year, Gillum worked at the George Soros-financed People for the American Way, where he served as Director of Youth Leadership Programs from 2005 until January 13, 2017, and oversaw a radical training outfit calling itself Young People For or YP4.\n\nThe YP4 organization said its mission was to challenge U.S. \u201cpredatory capitalism,\u201d abolish the prison system, fight a \u201cspiritual resistance\u201d battle against \u201cChristian hegemony,\u201d redefine the meaning of \u201cborders\u201d while aiding \u201cundocumented\u201d aliens, and enact the \u201ccollective liberation\u201d of \u201ccommunities of color\u201d amid what it described as the scourge of \u201cwhite supremacy.\u201d\n\nGillum\u2019s group accused the U.S. of being a \u201ccolonialist\u201d power perpetrating \u201cstructural violence\u201d and \u201ccontinued genocide.\u201d It claimed conservatives in the U.S. judicial system were \u201cjustifying white supremacist policing practices.\u201d\n\nThat extremist rhetoric and more was posted on the official \u201cissues\u201d sections of the YP4 website while Gillum not only served as its active director, but while his picture, position and bio were brandished on its \u201cstaff\u201d page.\n\nBreitbart News reported that Philip Agnew, the co-founder of Dream Defenders, is a 2005 graduate of Gillum\u2019s former YP4 group.\n\nAt a January 17, 2014 YP4 summit, Gillum\u2019s YP4 gave Agnew the Norman Lear Award, named after the producer and activist who founded People for the American Way.\n\nIt has emerged that at that same 2014 summit, Gillum\u2019s YP4 gave the Dream Defenders organization the \u201cMovement Building Partner Award.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis award is given to a progressive partner organization that has shown dedication and support to YP4 and has an outstanding commitment to social justice and the progressive movement at large,\u201d according to YP4 literature.\n\nDream Defenders has taken center stage in the gubernatorial race here in Florida over Gillum\u2019s continued refusal to disavow the group, which has engaged in activism to promote the boycott of Israel, and espouses anti-patriotic, anti-capitalism, anti-military and anti-police ideology, and with which Gillum has already been associated.\n\nRepublican challenger Ron DeSantis has repeatedly called for Gillum to distance himself from Dream Defenders, making another such call earlier this week.\n\nDuring a recent debate, Gillum claimed that he had \u201cno idea\u201d what DeSantis was referring to when he brought up a Dream Defenders pledge Gillum reportedly signed that supports a \u201cradical manifesto.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact is, Andrew signed a pledge with the Dream Defenders pledging his support, this radical manifesto,\u201d DeSantis said at the televised debate.\n\n\u201cI have no idea what pledge he is talking about,\u201d Gillum replied.\n\nLast week, 38 elected Florida Sheriffs called on Gillum to \u201cimmediately and unequivocally withdraw\u201d his support for a radical organization\u2019s \u201cFreedom Pledge\u201d that contains anti-police rhetoric.\n\nIn June 2018, Gillum signed a Dream Defenders pledge containing specific language stating, \u201cI pledge my support to the Freedom Papers.\u201d The organization\u2019s \u201cFreedom Papers,\u201d in turn, exclaim that \u201cpolice and prisons have no place in \u2018justice.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Dream Defenders \u201cFreedom Papers\u201d also advocate textbook socialist principals such as claiming that \u201cby virtue of being born each of us has the absolute right to adequate food, shelter, clothing, water, healthcare, effective public transportation, dignified work, living wages.\u201d\n\nDream Defenders\u2019 website refers to the entire State of Israel as the \u201csite of a continued settler colonial project,\u201d and laments U.S. military aid to the Jewish state. A large section of the site promotes the group\u2019s anti-Israel activism. Dream Defenders previously organized a flash mob in Israel to officially endorse the BDS movement against the Jewish state.\n\nBreitbart News reported two weeks ago that Gillum\u2019s Dream Defenders allies compiled an education tool for U.S. teachers about \u201cliberation\u201d movements that glorifies the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a deadly terrorist organization.\n\nA simple perusal of the Dream Defenders website finds the organization so feverishly championed by Gillum evidences the group\u2019s open radicalism. The organization calls for an \u201cend\u201d to \u201cdisaster capitalism\u201d and rants against Independence Day.\n\nMuch of that extremist rhetoric mirrors the phraseology posted on the official \u201cissues\u201d sections of Gillum\u2019s YP4 website while Gillum served as its active director.\n\nAs youth leadership director at PFAW from 2005 until last year, Gillum was in charge of both YP4, the organization\u2019s youth training program, and the organization\u2019s Young Elected Officials (YEO) Network, which he founded and describes itself as \u201cthe first national program singularly-focused on providing a network of support to young progressive state and local elected officials.\u201d\n\nEven while he was a Tallahassee city commissioner and later the city\u2019s mayor, Gillum was heavily involved in the YP4 youth leadership program as youth director, announcing multiple hires and headlining fundraising and group events.\n\nAt a PFAW dinner in 2011, Gillum said that even though he served as vice-mayor of Tallahassee at the time, his \u201cbest job\u201d was actually his position as the organization\u2019s youth director, where, he explained, he led YP4. He said his job there was to counter \u201cthe radical right,\u201d singling out Ann Coulter and Karl Rove as individuals who needed to be opposed.\n\nA review of an archived version of YP4\u2019s website from December 2016, while Gillum was still overseeing the group and listed on the \u201cstaff\u201d page, finds a site bursting with extremist rhetoric. Much of the same language still exists on the current version of the site.\n\nThe \u201cEconomic Justice\u201d section of Gillum\u2019s group\u2019s website demanded that activists challenge what it described as U.S. \u201cpredatory capitalism\u201d and instead work toward socialist-style economic ideals.\n\nThat section, which is part of the mission of YP4, stated:\n\nWe know that voracious predatory capitalism is a threat to the safety, well-being, and survival of our communities and our planet. As wages stagnate and intergenerational wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few, pathways to opportunity are becoming less and less accessible to the rest of us.

They consider those of us who support this president and support an American agenda as Nazis. They referred to us to as a racist, as white supremacist. Every time there\u2019s some horrific event they\u2019re trying to pin it on us, pin in on our president, pin on our party. It\u2019s really time America to push back. Enough is enough.

Dana Rohrabacher with a nine-point lead over Democrat challenger Harley Rouda with just days to go before the midterm elections on November 6.\n\nThe poll, conducted by Thomas Partners Strategies, shows Rohrabacher with the support of 50.7% of likely voters in the 48th congressional district, compared to Rouda\u2019s 41.6%. The margin of error is 4.7%.\n\nStrategist John Thomas notes: \u201cWhile California overall breaks in favor of Democrats and against Trump, CA-48 is proving to be the firewall holding back the blue wave.\u201d\n\nThe poll is the first to show Rohrabacher with a statistically significant lead. A poll last month by Monmouth University Polling Institute last month showed Rohrabacher with a small lead, within the margin of error, and previous polls had shown the race as a dead heat.\n\nRohrabacher\u2019s rise in the polls is remarkable, given that Rouda and his allies have outspent Rohrabacher many times over. Last month, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg dumped $4 million into the race against Rohrabacher, making the contest for the 48th district one of the most expensive in the country.\n\nBut Rohrabacher trounced Rouda in a debate, noting that the Democrat supported Medicare for illegal aliens. He also focused on issues of importance to local communities, such as discrimination against Asian-Americans in college admissions.\n\nHe even accompanied a busload of senior citizens to visit a marijuana dispensary to highlight his support for legalizing cannabis on the federal level.\n\nThomas elaborated on other factors helping Rohrabacher:\n\nTrump is popular [in the district], Republicans are winning the generic ballot and there is a slight edge for the amount of voters who want Trump\u2019s agenda to be pushed in Congress. This seat is proving reliably red with a large R+10 Republican registration advantage giving Rohrabcher a large cushion to absorb a generally unfavorable climate for Republicans nationally. Rouda is winning with No-Party-Preference voting bloc with 49.9% to Rohrabacher\u2019s 42.9%. Rohrabacher is winning with women with a commanding lead at 51.8% to Rouda\u2019s 40.9%. The tsunami of negative ads attacking Rohrabcher have done damage to his favorables putting him underwater at 50.4% unfav to 41.7% fav. Despite poor favorability for a 29-year incumbent, Rohrabacher has been given life support from Donald Trump.\n\nRouda has attacked Rohrabacher for supporting closer relations with Russia, an attack that has faltered as the story of \u201cRussian collusion\u201d has faded from the headlines in recent months for lack of evidence.\n\nJoel B.

Over the past 12 months, employers added an average of 211,000 jobs each month.\n\nWage growth, long considered the \u2018missing ingredient\u2019 to the economic expansion, has finally returned. Average hourly earnings climbed by five cents an hour for the month, or 83 cents year-over-year. That represents a 3.1 percent gain, the first time wages have grown more than 3 percent year-over-year.\n\nJob creation was widespread across all sectors of the economy.

At that time, Trump announced that he was restoring wide-ranging sanctions on Iran\u2019s economy. Trump gave oil buyers 180 days to wind down purchases of Iranian oil and announced that the final deadline for oil purchases would be Sunday, November 4. From May to September, Iran\u2019s oil exports fell by about a third.\n\nThe Trump administration has the power to enforce the sanctions because of the way that the international banking systems are interlocked. Iran can sell oil to another country, but in order to get paid, payment sooner or later has to pass through an entity that can be sanctioned by the U.S. for violating the Iran sanctions or can be cut off from the U.S. financial system altogether.\n\nThe European Union, which has expressed fury at the Trump administration for taking these actions, has been trying to set up a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d (SPV) that European countries can use to pay Iran without having to pass through a financial entity that the U.S. can punish. The original plan was to have the SPV in place by Monday, but implementing it has turned out to be too complex so far. Furthermore, E.U. officials are said to want to avoid a \u201cdirect confrontation\u201d with the Trump administration over Iran before the midterm elections on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. has reportedly agreed to grant a waiver to India to permit Indian oil companies to continue importing Iranian oil for four more months, until March. The terms of the waiver are not fully clear, but India will be required to cut its imports by a third. India will make 45 percent of the purchase in its own rupee currency, which Iran can then use to purchase rice, drugs, and other products from India. The other 55 percent of the payment will be made in euros, but this money will be held in escrow in India banks until the sanctions are lifted.\n\nThere are also reports that South Korea will be granted a waiver, although the details are not known.\n\nChina and Japan are also seeking waivers but have yet to receive them. China is Iran\u2019s biggest oil customer, but because of the U.S. sanctions, China\u2019s biggest refiners have reportedly halted imports in November until the US provides clarity. CNBC and India Times and CNBC and AFP\n\nEU splits on Iran sanctions after assassination attempt in Denmark\n\nWhen Trump withdrew from the JCPOA in May, officials in Denmark said they were shocked and surprised by Trump\u2019s decision. Former foreign minister Holger K. Nielsen said:\n\nIt is catastrophic for him to do this. It could have very serious consequences for the entire region. This was a way to stay Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions while giving more moderate forces wind in their sails. It is now a concern that hardliners [in Iran] will gain power. \u2026 That\u2019s why I am very, very concerned. If Iran resumes nuclear arms development, I fear that Israel or the US will attack Iran, and that will make the Iraq war look like a playground fight, because this would be much worse.\n\nThat was then. This is now. And now, Denmark is asking the European Union to impose additional sanctions on Iran.\n\nOn September 28, agents from Denmark\u2019s intelligence service (PET) saw an individual taking photos outside the home in Copenhagen of the leader of Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of al-Ahwaz (ASMLA). ASMLA is a separatist group demanding a separate Arab state in Iran\u2019s southwestern Khuzestan Province and is classified as a terrorist group by Iran. A previous leader of ASMLA had been shot dead in the Netherlands in November 2017, so PET was concerned that a new assassination was being planned.\n\nBy total coincidence, a Swedish-registered black Volvo started moving \u201csuspiciously\u201d outside the same house. When they tried to stop the car, it sped off. This triggered a major manhunt, during which a number of roads, bridges, and ferry routes were shut down, including connections between Denmark and Sweden. It turned out that the three occupants of the Volvo had no relation to the ASMLA case, but that the Volvo was a stolen car. They were only caught because of the ASMLA case, making them \u201cthe world\u2019s most unlucky criminals,\u201d according to the Copenhagen police.\n\nThe man taking the pictures was a Norwegian citizen of Iranian origin. He was arrested in Norway on October 21 and extradited to Denmark. A search of his home revealed numerous photos of the residences of members of ASMLA.\n\nDanish security officials have accused Iranian intelligence of \u201cplanning an attack on Danish soil\u201d against Iranian Arab dissidents.\n\nIran\u2019s Foreign Ministry denied the country had any role in the alleged assassination plot. It said in a statement: \u201cThis is yet another scenario in a series of conspiracies and plots by well-known Iran adversaries in an attempt to jeopardize the good and progressive Iran-EU relations at this very important and critical juncture.\u201d\n\nOther Iranian official suggested sabotage by the US, Saudi Arabia or Israel.\n\nSome analysts claim that hardliners in Iran\u2019s intelligence services may plan plots in Europe without the knowledge or control of Iran\u2019s government. The rogue elements may even be trying to undermine pragmatists in the Iranian government and good relations with Europe.\n\nThis is actually believable. As I describe in my book, Iran\u2019s Struggle for Supremacy: Tehran\u2019s Obsession to Redraw the Map of the Middle East, Iran is one of the most corrupt governments in the world. Iran\u2019s constitution has no checks and balances, and the only way to get ahead in the government is through bribery, extortion, and corruption.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday that Washington stood behind Denmark, a Nato ally.\n\nWe congratulate the government of #Denmark on its arrest of an Iranian regime assassin. For nearly 40 years, Europe has been the target of #Iran-sponsored terrorist attacks. We call on our allies and partners to confront the full range of Iran\u2019s threats to peace and security. \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) October 30, 2018\n\nThis situation has thrown a huge stumbling block into the EU plans to keep the JCPOA deal alive.\n\nIran has had a long record of pursuing opponents living abroad. Last month, a series of raids in France and across Europe caught several Iranian diplomats and sleeper cells planning terrorist operations. ( \u201c4-Oct-18 World View \u2014 Iran diplomats and sleeper cells arrested in France and across Europe\u201d)\n\nThere is a darkly ironic twist because Iran has strongly condemned Saudi Arabia\u2019s killing of Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, Turkey, and is now accused of the same crime. Russia has used the nerve agent Novichok to murder opponents living in Britain but, to my knowledge, they have issued no statement on Iran\u2019s alleged assassination attempt in Copenhagen.

Duncan Hunter (R-CA) served in the U.S. Marine Corps, completing two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan.\n\nNow, however, he says he is fighting a \u201cthree-pronged war\u201d \u2014 against his Democratic opponent, against the \u201cliberals in the Department of Justice,\u201d and against \u201cthe liberal media in San Diego\u201d who are determined to see him ousted.\n\nBut Hunter has a battle plan: he is staying on message. His focus on Thursday was border security, with a caravan of thousands of migrants making their way northward through Mexico, and the U.S. military deployed to meet them.\n\nAt a press conference atop an hill overlooking the border, Hunter unveiled a new idea, which he shared in a letter to President Donald Trump: use military engineers to build the \u201cfoundational road upon which the wall will be built.\u201d\n\nAs he explained to the president, the military already builds roads all over the world. The genius of the plan is that the money is already there.\n\n\u201cBy utilizing active and reserve military assets, for which funding already exists and whose deployment you have already suggested to address the armies of migrants moving to infiltrate our nation, you will save massive amounts of taxpayer dollars as well as precious time,\u201d Duncan wrote to Trump Thursday.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Hunter explained further.\n\n\u201cThe reality is \u2014 people say this, and they are right to an extent \u2014 if you build a 50-foot wall, you can get a 60-foot ladder. You can use a plasma cutter and cut through anything. It\u2019s the high-speed road that allows agents to react, that is the enabler for the entire border wall system.\u201d\n\nHe noted that U.S. military engineers already train for road-building at sites in other parts of the country. \u201cThey\u2019re practicing everywhere in the U.S., just not on the border \u2014 just do it there now,\u201d Hunter argued. Using the military to build the wall could cut the wall\u2019s current $25 billion price tag in half, he estimates.\n\nThe wall, he said, will also need a road for maintenance purposes, since it will likely use electronic sensors to enable the U.S. Border Patrol to monitor what is happening at any point along the boundary. He pointed to the high-tech systems that Israel uses in its security barrier in the West Bank to keep terrorists out of the country. \u201cWe can absolutely learn more from Israel\u201d about building the wall, he argued.\n\nHunter added that the U.S. faces many of the same risks Israel does, even though \u201cthe consequences in Israel, because of the hostility that surrounds them, are more pronounced because they\u2019re so small and it only takes one or two things to happen to make it a really huge deal.\u201d The crime committed by illegal aliens is as dangerous as terrorism, he argues; it is just more dispersed.\n\nThe example of Israel is relevant to the race for the 50th congressional district, which is tighter than it has ever been. Hunter has led his challenger, Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, in every poll \u2014 but the gap has narrowed.\n\nCampa-Najjar, a Palestinian-Mexican \u201cprogressive\u201d millennial who backs \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and other far-left policies, was a long-shot candidate until federal prosecutors indicted Hunter and his wife on charges of mis-using campaign funds in August.\n\nHunter considers the prosecution a political hit, not unlike the Department of Justice\u2019s attempt to eavesdrop on Trump campaign associates in the 2016 race. \u201cThey want me out of Congress,\u201d he said Thursday.\n\nHe notes that two of the prosecutors attended a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in 2015, posing for photos with her. They had information about his campaign expenditures for years, he says, but only indicted him after the primary election and before the general election, when it was too late for him to step aside. (California does not allow a political party to substitute another candidate after the primary election.) He says he expects to prevail in court.\n\nIn the meantime, he told Breitbart News, \u201cThe DOJ handed Ammar his campaign slogans and literature on a silver platter \u2014 on purpose.\u201d\n\nIn response, Hunter has drawn attention to Campa-Najjar\u2019s unusual family background. He is the grandson of Muhammad Youssef al-Najjar, a Palestinian terrorist who was involved in the massacre of eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany.\n\n\u201cAbu Youssef,\u201d as he was also known, was the deputy to the late Yasser Arafat, the leader of the terrorist Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and co-founded its political party, Fatah, which still runs the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThough Campa-Najjar denounced his grandfather\u2019s terrorism earlier this year, he called him a \u201clegend\u201d and a \u201cpublic servant\u201d in a 2015 Instagram post, and his father, a former Palestinian official, still lionizes Abu Youssef as a \u201cmartyr.\u201d (His father also recently referred to the Israeli commandos who killed his father in 1973, including future prime minister Ehud Barak, as \u201cdogs.\u201d)\n\nPerhaps because of those historical associations, which emerged during the primary election, Campa-Najjar changed his legal name after the primary from \u201cAmmar Yasser Najjar\u201d to \u201cAmmar Joseph Campa-Najjar.\u201d He says he has always gone by the latter, except for much of the campaign he has referred to himself as \u201cAmmar Campa.\u201d\n\nLast year, Campa-Najjar received a campaign donation from a Palestinian ambassador, which he refuses to return. Campa-Najjar has also taken tens of thousands of dollars from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), and his campaign also donated money to CAIR.*\n\nHunter cites these facts to argue that Campa-Najjar is a \u201csecurity risk\u201d \u2014 a claim that provoked an outcry in the media, which accuses Hunter of racism and Islamophobia. But \u201cit\u2019s all factual,\u201d he told Breitbart News.\n\nHe half-expected Campa-Najjar to crash the press conference, as he did recently when Hunter\u2019s father held his own conference to lay out the case against the Democrat. But, he muses, that would have backfired. \u201cHe\u2019s open borders,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cThat\u2019s a bad backdrop for him politically. Imagine talking about the wall \u2014 and him saying, \u2018I\u2019m not for that.\u2019\u201d\n\nHunter is not doing his own polling, and he is saving money on overhead by not opening campaign offices. Instead, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re spending every resource that we have getting the word out\u201d on Campa-Najjar.\n\nThus far, Hunter\u2019s strategy seems to be working \u2014 though it is still anyone\u2019s guess what will happen on Election Day.\n\nIn addition to border issues, Hunter also stresses that the Trump economy has been outstanding for his district. He noted that the average family in the district is saving thousands of dollars per year because of the Republicans\u2019 tax cuts. Moreover, he said, there was an average real increase in annual salaries of $7,000.\n\n\u201cA lot of people do defense work. People are doing construction. People are relatively happy,\u201d he said.\n\nOn health care, which is a major theme for Democrats in the closing weeks, he says that claims Republicans want to remove coverage for pre-existing conditions are \u201cbaloney.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last health care plan we passed had pre-existing conditions in it,\u201d he said. He laments the fact that the Senate failed to pass the House bill, but is hopeful a solution can be found in the next Congress.\n\nHunter could not predict whether Republicans would still control all of Capitol Hill. But he credits Trump for the fact that the race for the House is as close as it is.\n\n\u201cIf Republicans hold the house, it\u2019s not about the individual [candidates]. It\u2019s about President Trump. If we win, or barely lose, it would have been worse without a President Trump.\n\n\u201cI think people that were trump supporters \u2014 they like what he\u2019s doing. And the last thing he hasn\u2019t done, that is not his fault, is building the border wall. He\u2019s got a chance to do it \u2026 and he could do it for free,\u201d he said, coming back to his plan.\n\nAs for Hunter\u2019s own chances, election night? \u201cI expect to win,\u201d he said.\n\nJoel B.

That case, in turn, led the FBI to discontinue its work with the organization. In 2009, a federal judge ruled that the government \u201cproduced ample evidence to establish\u201d the ties of CAIR with Hamas, the Palestinian terror organization . The United Arab Emirates labeled CAIR a terrorist organization in 2014 (a decision that the Obama administration opposed).", "Israeli Minister of Diaspora Affairs Naftali Bennett kicked in the foundations of the left\u2019s case against President Donald Trump on Tuesday. And they didn\u2019t like it.\n\nSince Saturday\u2019s massacre of 11 mostly elderly Jews at prayer at the Tree of Life Synagogue, prominent left-wing American Jewish activists and Never Trump pundits have blamed Trump for the massacre by insisting that he has empowered antisemitic forces in the U.S.\n\nThe \u201cproof\u201d these commentators provide for their incendiary allegation is the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s 2017 report on antisemitic incidents in the U.S. The ADL alleged that during Trump\u2019s first year in office, there was a 57 percent rise in antisemitic incidents.\n\nBennett flew to Pittsburgh Sunday as the representative of the Israeli government to show solidarity with the Jewish community in the aftermath of the massacre. Before travelling back to Israel, he participated in a roundtable discussion of antisemitism in New York at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nWhen asked about the ADL data, Bennett said that he wasn\u2019t certain that the report was accurate. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced those are the facts,\u201d Bennett said adding, \u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a surge in antisemitism in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to look at the facts. I understand that the ADL themselves have stated there is a drastic reduction in violent anti-Semitic events, but that has for some reason been hidden from the public discourse,\u201d he maintained.\n\nBennett\u2019s statement aligned with an analysis of the ADL data published Wednesday by Prof. David Bernstein at Tablet online magazine. Bernstein noted that despite the fact that the ADL itself made its allegation that antisemitic incidents in 2017 \u2013 Trump\u2019s first year in office \u2013 \u201csurged nearly 60 percent,\u201d the data it included in its survey tell a completely different story.\n\nFirst of all, as Bernstein pointed out, the data don\u2019t describe actual antisemitic incidents. Rather. they describe reported incidents, including incidents that people perceived as antisemitic which may not have been antisemitic.\n\nFor instance, the ADL report includes 163 bomb threats that were made against U.S. Jewish institutions. But those weren\u2019t incidents motivated by antisemitism. Those threats were the work of an Israeli mental patient.\n\nThe report also states that antisemitic incidents on university campuses in 2017 increased nearly 100 percent over the number of such incidents in 2016 \u2013 from 108 incidents to 204. But the report ignores the fact that the vast majority of those attacks are carried out by far leftists and Muslims \u2014 who are not Trump supporters.\n\nLast week, Commentary published a major expos\u00e9 of ADL Executive Director Jonathan Greenblatt by Seth Mandel. Mandel\u2019s article, \u201cThe Shame of the Anti-Defamation League,\u201d detailed how Greenblatt, who took over the ADL in July 2015 directly from Valerie Jarrett\u2019s influence shop at the Obama White House, has transformed what was once American Jewry\u2019s premier institution for fighting antisemitism into a partisan activist group dedicated to fighting Republicans, defending the left\u2019s political agenda, and attacking Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government.\n\nGreenblatt has gone out of his way to minimize criticism of out-and-out antisemites on the left like Congressmen Keith Ellison (D-MN) and Andre Carson (D-IN); Women\u2019s March leader Linda Sarsour; and others. And at the same time, Greenblatt has taken steps that cross the line from reporting to propagandizing to exaggerate the scale of antisemitic incidents emanating from the neo-Nazi end of the political spectrum, and then to blame Republicans for those incidents.\n\nAs Mandel explained:\n\nUnder Greenblatt, the ADL paints a picture of the political right\u2019s extremists as connected. But instances of left-wing extremism aren\u2019t given the same treatment; they are depicted as isolated incidents, not dots to be connected. Meanwhile, Ellison is the DNC\u2019s No. 2; Sarsour helped the campaign of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and then ran the Women\u2019s March; and a slew of prominent Democrats have been kicking the Jewish community in the teeth.\n\nThe basic fallacy of the ADL\u2019s report on antisemitic incidents is best exposed by the actual data it dioes contain. The report contained actual data related to violent antisemitic attacks. And it turns out that those measurable, real attacks decreased 47 percent in 2017.\n\nWhereas in 2016 there were 37 violent antisemitic attacks against Jews in America, in 2017, there were only 19 violent antisemitic attacks. As Bernstein notes, somewhat understatedly, \u201cPhysical assaults are\u2026the most objective sort of incident to document, which adds to concerns about the robustness of the rest of the data.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us back to Bennett. Batya Ungar Sargon of the leftist Forward Jewish newspaper tweeted:\n\nIn the wake of the deadliest attack against Jews in the history of the U.S., @naftalibennett calls @ADL_National fake news. YOU JUST CAN\u2019T MAKE THIS STUFF UP https://t.co/im9IUY5tvy \u2014 Batya Ungar-Sargon (@bungarsargon) October 31, 2018\n\nThen there is Obama\u2019s ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro. Shapiro wrote an article in the Forward in which he basically told Israelis to shut up.\n\nShapiro argued that the entire U.S. Jewish community is in a state of mourning, and that visiting Israelis should keep silent and not challenge American Jews.\n\n(He has no qualms, however, about telling Israelis what to do, and is the keynote speaker at a major event in Chicago in December for J Street, a far-left organization whose sole purpose is forcing Israel to comply with the wishes of liberal American Jews.)\n\nThe problem is that due to Greenblatt \u2014 Shapiro\u2019s former colleague in the Obama administration \u2014 and his subversion of the ADL, a once credible American Jewish organization, American Jews are basing their assessments of the manifold threats facing their community on lies and leftist propaganda.\n\nPointing out that Greenblatt misrepresents his own data is not butting in.

These include French energy giant Total and carmakers Peugeot and Renault as well as Germany\u2019s Siemens and Daimler.\n\nIran and the E.U. announced their defiance towards U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration after high-level talks at the United Nations in September. E.U. foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini delivered her plan for continued bi-lateral trade while standing alongside Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.\n\nThe coaliton forming between the E.U. and Iran was met with disbelief and anger from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n\ufeff\n\nJohn Bolton, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, also mocked the E.U. for being light on detail for how its evasion mechanisms will work.\n\n\u201cThe European Union is strong on rhetoric and weak on follow-through,\u201d he told the United Against a Nuclear Iran campaign. \u201cWe do not intend to allow our sanctions to be evaded by Europe or anybody else.\u201d\n\nBolton also issued unsubtle warnings to Iran\u2019s leaders: \u201cWe are watching, and we will come after you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you cross us, our allies or our partners, if you harm our citizens, if you continue to lie, cheat and deceive, there will be hell to pay.\u201d\n\nU.S. Arab allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as well as Israel have long sought for Washington to work to curtail non-Arab and predominantly Shiite Muslim Iran\u2019s influence in the Middle East, including in war-torn Syria.\n\nThey applauded when the first sanctions came into force on August 7, banning:\n\n\u2013 The Iranian government\u2019s purchases of dollars, or the international buying and selling of significant sums of rials, Iran\u2019s under-pressure currency\n\n\u2013 Purchases of Iranian treasury bonds\n\n\u2013 Trade in gold or other precious metals, aluminum, steel, carbon or graphite\n\n\u2013 Automobile and commercial aviation trade\n\n\u2013 US imports of Iranian carpets or foodstuffs\n\nDespite Mr. Trump fulfilling a campaign promise by re-imposing the sanctions, some Obama-era officials including former Secretary of State John Kerry have been caught working behind the scene to help the E.U. continue their trade.\n\nI have been told by banking officials in Europe that former senior Obama officials worked with European officials to design sanctions evasion schemes.

It\u2019s not unlike what I experienced with the life of ISIS [Islamic State] who was very successful using social media only to recruit and radicalize people, and it\u2019s almost a very similar psychology at work, here.

So it would be a historic mistake.\u201d\n\nThe former Congressman said he fears Gillum would \u201cappoint Bernie Sanders-style radicals to all of the agencies in Florida and that would probably be even worse for business than has tax increases, which would obviously be destructive.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it would really be a one-two punch and it would totally stop Florida\u2019s economic momentum,\u201d he added.\n\nRegarding his own economic platform, DeSantis said he will capitalize on Florida\u2019s attractive positon following President Trump\u2019s change in state and local tax (SALT) deductions. He pledged to further \u201cdo what we can in terms of eliminating some dumb taxes in Florida, like a business rent tax. I would like to reduce our business tax generally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe greater imbalance we can have between a low tax Florida and high tax in these other areas that is going to recruit more and more investment into Florida.\u201d\n\nDeSantis continued:\n\nAnd I think we are looking at a mass migration potentially of financial services into places like Palm Beach and Miami. I think you\u2019re going to see more technology developed in Florida if we keep the climate good and do some of the things I am talking about. And then even manufacturing because I think it would be attractive to expand the manufacturing footprint here.\n\n\u201cNone of that will happen if Gillum gets his way,\u201d DeSantis warned.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Sometimes, Gavin helped marry people. Some marriages were not between a man and a woman. He made sure that people\u2019s rights were respected.\n\nFitzgerald says the profile of Newsom in the textbook \u201creads like a press release from the Newsom campaign,\u201d and has been included in the first- grade history curriculum as a result of a California law known as the Fair Act.\n\n\u201cThe Fair Act requires history textbooks in the state of California to be more inclusive when it comes to underrepresented minorities,\u201d explains Fitzgerald. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna mince any words here. This is the state of California inserting political propaganda into first-grade textbooks, propaganda endorsing the occupant of the second highest office in the state of California.\u201d\n\nFitzgerald and the Freedom Center are advocating for a code of ethics for K-12 educators that prohibits teachers \u201cfrom using their classrooms for political, ideological, or religious advocacy.\u201d", "Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) sent a letter Thursday to President Donald Trump urging him to use the U.S. military to build a road that will service a future wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, using funds that are already appropriated.\n\nHunter addressed the media from atop an outlook in Otay Mesa, California, with a panoramic view of the existing border fences \u2014 one on the American side, and one along running along the northern boundary of Tijuana, Mexico.\n\nIn the letter, Hunter offers \u201ca solution that will provide for completing a large portion of the border wall project in the next three months with no additional funding from Congress.\u201d\n\nHe explained the idea at his press conference. Given that Trump is sending troops to assist Border Patrol in dealing with the \u201ccaravan\u201d of migrants from Central America, Hunter told reporters, the military should use the opportunity to build what he called a \u201cfoundational road.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I want to see them do, and what the president should direct them to do, is build those roads on the border right now,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important thing that the president can do, because building the high-speed road is more than half the cost of the border wall.\n\n\u201cWe can save taxpayers tens of billions of dollars in equipment and man-hours if you have the military start building the road on the border right now,\u201d he argued.\n\nThe road would help the military patrol the wall, as well as assist in maintaining it and any electronic systems.\n\nHunter also suggested that the military assist in building new detention facilities so that illegal aliens, once caught by border patrol, would not simply be released into the country, as is the current practice, given limited space.\n\nThough Thursday\u2019s event was not a campaign event, it was one of the few public events Hunter has held recently.\n\nHunter is running for re-election in the 50th congressional district, a traditionally safe Republican seat that is more competitive this year, largely because Hunter and his wife were indicted on charges of mis-using campaign funds. (Hunter says he is innocent and the charges are politically motivated.)\n\nHis opponent, Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, is a left-wing progressive and the grandson of a Palestinian terrorist who is narrowly behind in the polls.\n\nSome had expected Campa-Najjar to crash the press conference, as he did last month when Hunter\u2019s father, who once represented the district, gave a \u201csecurity briefing\u201d outlining the case against Campa-Najjar. On that occasion, Campa-Najjar suggested that Hunter was afraid to face him.\n\nHowever, he stayed away from the briefing. Two of his supporters \u2014 one apparently a campaign staffer \u2014 attended instead, as did half a dozen border security activists.\n\nJournalists from local news outlets peppered Hunter with questions, such as whether his letter was just a political stunt. Hunter rejected the idea: \u201cRight now is the time to do it, with the military headed to the border now,\u201d he said.\n\nDiane Harkey, a Republican member of the State Board of Equalization who is running for Congress in the 49th district, also spoke. She reminded reporters that it was Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris \u2014 a potential presidential candidate \u2014 who had published a report in 2014, as California\u2019s attorney general, about transnational gangs.\n\nHarkey said that report is still relevant, and that the smuggling of drugs \u2014 especially opioids \u2014 was a major local problem.\n\nJuan Hidalgo, who is running for Congress in the nearby 51st district, told reporters that the desire for a strong border was about security, not race. \u201cIt has nothing to racism. It has everything to do with national security. Nobody has a right just to enter our country.\u201d He added that he supported legal immigration: \u201cI want a real big wall, but I want a real big door, too.\u201d\n\nChris Harris, an official with the National Border Patrol Council union, explained: \u201cWe don\u2019t hate the people out there\u2026 we care about the people in here.\u201d He said that Border Patrol officers at the Imperial Beach station had begun screening migrants for typhus. \u201cWe are not a third world country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should lift countries to first world status, but not lower ourselves.\u201d\n\nHarris added: \u201cNo one should be against security \u2026 Follow the law. We are a country of laws, not a country of man. That goes all the way back to the Magna Carta.\u201d\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Out of the 193-member body, the final result was 189-2 with no abstentions, as Moldova and Ukraine were unable to vote.\n\nThe U.S. had tabled eight amendments, all of which were rejected, that criticized the communist regime\u2019s flagrant human rights violations including everything from political repression to a total lack of democracy and freedom of expression.\n\nFollowing the vote, outgoing U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley denounced the exercise as a \u201cwaste of time,\u201d adding that the U.N. had \u201clost the opportunity to speak on behalf of human rights\u201d and that the Cuban people \u201cbeen left, once again, to the brutal winds of the Castro dictatorship.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur reason for the embargo is and has always been Cuba\u2019s denial of freedom and the denial of the most basic human rights for the Cuban people,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are no winners here today, there are only losers.

While the Afghan government is working on a new regional drug strategy, the United States is not. The State Department\u2019s new \u201cIntegrated Country Strategy\u201d for Afghanistan no longer includes counternarcotics as a priority, but instead apparently subsumes the issue into general operations there. Meanwhile, the U.S. military says it has no counternarcotics mission in Afghanistan, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) says it will not plan, design, or implement new programs to address opium-poppy cultivation.\n\nAlarmed by the \u201clack of priority for counternarcotics efforts among U.S. and Afghan officials and the lack of success in reducing opium cultivation and production,\u201d American senators have urged SIGAR to \u201cconduct a thorough review of the U.S. government\u2019s current counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan, including the effectiveness of the current airstrike campaign and the effects of money laundering and corruption on counternarcotics efforts.\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding the lack of a U.S.-led strategy, the U.S. continues to fund Kabul efforts against illicit drugs.\n\nSIGAR reported:\n\nThe State Department said a stand-alone strategy would not necessarily improve coordination. Though the Counter Narcotics Working Group has not met since September 2017, according to State, coordination of U.S. government counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan continues.\n\nUnder Trump, the United States has shifted the man focus of its counternarcotics efforts to pressure the Taliban to join \u201creconciliation talks with Kabul, SIGAR suggested, noting:\n\nAccording to the State Department\u2019s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), the United States will not issue a separate counternarcotics strategy that had been under review since 2014. Instead, INL said counternarcotics is interwoven throughout the U.S. Administration\u2019s comprehensive South Asia strategy. The goal of the South Asia strategy is to create conditions for a political process to achieve a lasting, Afghan-led peace.\n\nSIGAR continued to question the effectiveness of the U.S. air campaign to deny the Taliban revenue streams, specifically from opium and heroin.\n\nThe watchdog agency told Congress:\n\nAs of August 2018, counterthreat-finance operations targeting the Taliban\u2019s revenue streams have destroyed 200 drug-related targets and denied the Taliban approximately $46 million in revenue, according to Department of Defense (DOD) statements to the Wall Street Journal\u2026According to David Mansfield, an expert on Afghanistan\u2019s opium industry, heroin profits and taxes are not as large as U.S. forces estimate and bombing drug labs will have a negligible effect on Taliban revenues. According to DOD, however, Mr. Mansfield\u2019s views are contradicted by CIA classified assessments based on intelligence reviews and the costly changes observed in the tactics, techniques, and procedures of drug-trafficking organizations.\n\nFurthermore, the watchdog agency pointed out that the opium trade is fueling the unprecedented opioid epidemic in the United States that killed about 49,000 people in 2017, making it more lethal than terrorist attacks across the globe that year.\n\nSIGAR noted:\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s opium crisis is worse than ever. The country remains the world\u2019s leading producer of opium, with production hitting an all-time high last year. In addition to increasing the human misery associated with drug abuse, Afghanistan\u2019s narcotics industry helps finance the insurgency, supports criminal networks, fosters public corruption, and undermines the Afghan state. Although this poison contributes a minimal amount to the narcotics epidemic in the United States, Afghanistan\u2019s deadly crop is the largest source of street heroin in Europe and Canada.\n\nA U.S. federal court recently sentenced two Afghan heroin traffickers arrested in Thailand and extradited to 15 years and 10.9 years, respectively, for conspiring to import large quantities of heroin into the United States, SIGAR acknowledged.\n\nU.S. counternarcotics efforts have made \u201cmodest or limited impact\u201d on addressing the expanding opium cultivation in Afghanistan and the illicit heroin trade, which reached unprecedented levels last year.", "A California state audit has found the state government paid $4 billion to provide Medi-Cal coverage for almost a half million potentially ineligible people between 2014 and 2017.\n\nCalifornia State Auditor Elaine Howle released an audit on October 30 that revealed \u201cpervasive discrepancies between the state and county systems when we compared Medi-Cal beneficiary eligibility data\u2014more than 453,000 beneficiaries were marked as eligible in the State\u2019s system but were not listed as eligible in county systems.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the audit found 54,000 people who were marked eligible in the county systems but not the state, which may have delayed access for entitled services.\n\nThe audit, prepared for the California legislature, documented that over half the state enrollment \u201cdiscrepancies\u201d that were not in the county systems had lasted for more than two years. As a result, $3 billion in managed care premiums and $1 billion in fee-for-service claims may have been improperly paid.\n\nTo qualify for Medi-Cal under federal rules, a single adult must earn less than $16,754 a year. Although California only has about 12 percent of America\u2019s population, it accounts for 18.5 percent of all Medicaid participants. The latest enrollment figures for the joint federal- and state-funded Medi-Cal program as of May 2018 were 13,171,041, or over 33 percent of the state\u2019s population and about half of its youth.\n\nThe California audit follows a February U.S. Health and Human Services Inspector General report that estimated that the state enrolled 366,078 ineligible persons through the Obamacare Medicaid expansion at a cost of $738.2 million. The Inspector General also found that California spent another $416.5 million for 79,055 expansion enrollees who were \u201cpotentially\u201d ineligible.\n\nThe most egregious example cited in the California audit was a resident of Los Angeles County that died in December 2013, yet the state continued to make regular monthly payments to the beneficiary\u2019s Medi-Cal health plan until August of this year. The estimated payments for an individual that the state \u201cshould have known was no longer in need of services\u201d amounted to $383,000.\n\nThe Democratic candidate for governor, Lt. Gov.

The victims included several members of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), loyal to the theocratic side of Iran\u2019s government.\n\nA group of Sunni Muslim separatists called Jaish al-Adl (\u201cArmy of Justice\u201d) claimed responsibility for the abduction, describing it as retaliation for Shiite-dominated Iran\u2019s oppression of Sunnis. The IRGC announced it had killed the number two leader of Jaish al-Adl two weeks before the abduction.\n\nThe IRGC has placed a high priority on recovering the captives and demanded Pakistan do more to \u201cconfront these terrorist groups that are supported by some regional states,\u201d as a statement issued by the IRGC shortly after the kidnapping said. The Iranians have floated the idea of attacking Sunni militia bases inside Pakistan if Islamabad does not deal with the separatists.\n\nPakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi responded by blaming the Jaish al-Adl attack on \u201ccommon enemies unhappy with the existing close, friendly relations between Pakistan and Iran.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the Iranians and Pakistanis both think Saudi Arabia is behind the attack. The IRGC ground forces commander reportedly denounced Jaish al-Adl as \u201cpaid mercenaries\u201d of Saudi Arabia in a meeting with tribal elders.\n\nIn addition to meeting with the prime minister, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif met with the Pakistani army chief of staff to discuss border security and plans to rescue the kidnapped border guards.\n\nThe Diplomat wrote this week that tensions between Pakistan and Iran are worse than either side wants to admit, in part because of the Sunni Muslims mentioned above, a group known as the Balochs who live on both sides of the Pakistan-Iran border. The Balochs have a history of uneasy relations with both Pakistan and Iran dating back to the Cold War era, while their territory is coveted by both countries, in part because of their port cities, which also make the Balochs players in the regional rivalry between India and China.\n\nThe Iranians are believed to have funded various insurgent groups inside Pakistan, including Balochs living on the Pakistani side of the border, as part of Tehran\u2019s regional shadow war with Saudi Arabia and the United States. There are Shiite groups considered terrorists by the Pakistani government that openly claim to be supported by Iran. Iran sees itself offering protection to Shiite groups in the border region which are not well defended by the Pakistani government.\n\nIran has always been concerned about Pakistan\u2019s relations with Saudi Arabia, but might be even more eager to woo Pakistan out of the Saudi orbit as tough new U.S. sanctions will go into effect next week. Pakistan has indicated it opposes the sanctions and continues to support the nuclear deal with Iran arranged by the Obama administration, but Islamabad is also interested in developing better relations with the United States and has indicated a reluctance to antagonize Washington by helping Iran evade the upcoming sanctions.", "A pair of University of Kentucky basketball greats are demanding that their plaques be removed unless the school stops the sale of Ku Klux Klan and Nazi items sold at collector\u2019s historical swap meets and gun shows held at the university\u2019s Expo Center.\n\nRex Chapman, a University of Kentucky star from the 1986 to the 1989 seasons who went on to a 12-year-long NBA career, told the school that he does not want his plaque hanging at the school unless they disallow Nazi items at the collector\u2019s show sales, the Louisville Courier Journal reported.\n\n\u201cIf you guys can\u2019t guarantee Nazi clothing & paraphernalia won\u2019t be sold/glamorized on the premises then I would ask that my plaque be removed from the facility,\u201d Chapman wrote on Twitter. \u201cI want no part of hate.\u201d\n\nHi @KyVenues \u2013\n\nMy KY HOF plaque hangs in Freedom Hall commemorating induction in 2011.\n\nIf you guys can\u2019t guarantee Nazi clothing & paraphernalia won\u2019t be sold/glamorized on the premises then I would ask that my plaque be removed from the facility.

She gave birth to Don Jr. in 1977, Ivanka in 1981 and Eric in 1984.

Ironically, he is one reason Republicans have a fighting chance to retain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives Tuesday.\n\nThat is because in 2010, Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u2014 Obamacare \u2014 over the objections of the majority of the voting public, and without a single Republican vote.\n\nThe ensuing backlash saw Nancy Pelosi booted out of the Speaker\u2019s chair, and also lifted hundreds of Republicans into state legislative seats. The following year, Republicans largely controlled the re-drawing of congressional districts after the 2010 Census.\n\nDemocrats complained about gerrymandering \u2014 but they did the same in the legislatures they controlled, using new boundaries to pick off most of the members of the Tea Party freshman class of congressmen in Illinois, for example.\n\nIn retrospect, it was a profound strategic miscalculation by Obama, whose political skill was widely admired after the 2008 presidential campaign. Obama enjoyed such popularity and support from the media that all he needed to do after being elected after the financial crash was allow the economy to repair itself.\n\nInstead, he and his party exploited the crisis to enact laws and regulations that massively expanded the power of the federal government.\n\nOne reason they did so was best articulated by Obama\u2019s first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, who said in November 2008: \u201cYou never want a serious crisis to go to waste.\u201d\n\nFew of Obama\u2019s policies would have passed under normal circumstances. The Great Recession and the \u201chope and change\u201d victory created a unique opportunity for the left to push its utopian vision of universal health care \u2014 which, they hoped, would open the door to other radical changes.\n\nThe other reason had less to do with circumstances and more to do with Obama himself. As a young community organizer, Obama lionized Harold Washington, the first black mayor of Chicago. He watched in dismay as white Democrats prevented Washington from carrying out his agenda. In response, Washington turned to incremental changes that he could make using his executive powers. After several years of \u201ccouncil wars,\u201d Washington broke through the opposition. But suddenly, a few months into his second term, Mayor Washington died of a heart attack.\n\nThe lesson Obama took from watching Harold Washington was that leaders who wished to be transformative had to undertake sweeping changes right away, rather than waiting for the most opportune political moment. And so, when he took office as president, he did not focus on fixing the economy, but rather went for Democrats\u2019 biggest goals.\n\nThe problem was that Obamacare tried to help 15% of the country by changing a health insurance system with which the other 85% of the country was satisfied. Individuals lost their insurance, and their doctors; premiums skyrocketed; small businesses faced new uncertainty \u2014 while the private insurance industry continued to profit. Republicans swept the House \u2014 and redrew congressional districts, hurting Democrats for the next ten years.\n\nThe experts predict that Democrats will win the House on Tuesday. That would fit with historical patterns. It is also the result of the fact that wealthier voters have migrated to the Democratic Party in recent years.\n\nBut Republicans still have a chance to win, partly because they are defending favorable districts.

Roads have been blocked, and educational institutes have been closed as protests by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) workers against the verdict have paralyzed daily life in various cities of the country.\n\nThe meeting came a day after Prime Minister Imran Khan issued a stark warning to Islamists that have been threatening violence over the Pakistani Supreme Court verdict to acquit Bibi.\n\nAddressing the protesters \u2014 linked to the Islamist TLP party that rose to prominence during the recent elections by campaigning on punishing blasphemy \u2014 PM Khan cautioned on Wednesday:\n\nI appeal to these elements \u2026 do not clash with the state. I appeal to you, don\u2019t harm this country in order to [increase your] vote bank. If you continue doing this\u2026 let me make it clear to you \u2026 the state will fulfil its duty [and] protect people\u2019s properties and lives. We will not allow any vandalism [or] blockage of traffic. I appeal to you\u2026 do not take the state to a point where it has no option but to take action.\n\nNevertheless, thousands of protestors ignored the PM\u2019s warnings and took to the streets on Thursday.\n\nAl Jazeera reports:\n\nThousands of far-right religious demonstrators continue to block major roads across Pakistan in protest against the acquittal of a Christian woman in a high-profile blasphemy case. The Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) political party, led by firebrand Muslim leader Khadim Rizvi, organized rallies in cities across the South Asian country on Thursday, despite a warning from Prime Minister Imran Khan not to \u201cforce the government to have to take action\u201d.\n\nProtests have been raging across Pakistan since shortly after the country\u2019s supreme court decision to rescind Bibi\u2019s 2010 death row verdict on Wednesday. Bibi, a Christian mother of five, was on death row for eight years.\n\nTLP-linked protesters have threatened to kill Bibi and judges who acquitted her.\n\nOn Thursday, Pakistan\u2019s Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry indicated that Islamabad was avoiding the use of force against protestors to resolve the issue peacefully.\n\nPBS News learned from Bibi\u2019s family that the Christian mother plan to leave Pakistan soon.\n\nHuman rights group have determined that some Muslims repeatedly use Pakistan\u2019s blasphemy laws to settle personal vendettas against Christians and other religious minorities across the country, where authorities have arrested dozens of people for allegedly insulting Islam.\n\nCiting the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, Al Jazeera notes, \u201cThere are still roughly 40 people on death row or serving life sentences for blasphemy, in Pakistan.\u201d\n\nPunishments for blasphemy can include a fine or a prison term, depending on the nature of the offense.\n\nAlthough Pakistan has sentenced offenders to death under the law, Pakistan has yet to execute anyone for committing blasphemy.\n\nHowever, radicals are known to take the law into their own hands have killed dozens following blasphemy accusations.\n\nAccording to a count by Al Jazeera, \u201cat least 74 people have been killed in violence related to blasphemy allegations since 1990.\u201d", "President Donald Trump responded Thursday to Oprah Winfrey\u2019s campaign for Stacy Abrams, a Democrat running for Governor of the State of Georgia.\n\n\u201cThe woman that she\u2019s supporting is not qualified to be the governor of Georgia by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump said that Abrams\u2019 history and her ideas made her unqualified for the governorship.\n\n\u201cTake a look at her past, take a look at her history, take a look at what she wants to do and what she has in mind for the state. That state will be in big, big trouble very quickly,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president commented on the Georgia race for governor after reporters asked him to respond to Winfrey\u2019s campaign rallies in Georgia.\n\nHe did not have a negative comment for Winfrey.\n\n\u201cOprah\u2019s liked me very much, I\u2019ve always liked her,\u201d Trump said, noting that he was a guest on her show during it\u2019s last week on television.\n\nThe president noted that he would travel to Georgia in the remaining days left before the election to support Republican candidate Brian Kemp.\n\n\u201cI think Brian\u2019s going to be a great governor of Georgia,\u201d Trump said.", "China immediately denounced Tuesday\u2019s unsealed U.S. indictment of ten Chinese agents for a five-year plot to steal aerospace technology as \u201csheer fiction and completely fabricated.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department promised those charges were just the beginning of a major pushback against intellectual property theft and made good on Thursday by filing charges against a state-owned Chinese firm for stealing technology from the largest memory chip maker in America, Micron Technology.\n\nThe new U.S. charges concern the Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Company, which is embroiled in a legal battle with Micron. Micron accused Jinhua of conspiring with a Taiwanese company called UMC to hire away key Micron employees and encourage them to bring proprietary Micron technology with them. Micron further accused the Chinese government of issuing a temporary ban against sales of its products in China to retaliate against the company for suing Jinhua.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department announced export restrictions against Jinhua on Monday. On Thursday, the Justice Department followed up with criminal indictments against Jinhua, UMC, and three Taiwanese nationals for technology theft.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal saw the indictments as contributing to \u201ca growing consensus that China is in violation of the 2015 bilateral pact between [Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping] and then-President Obama on cybertheft,\u201d although the Micron case does not involve hacking per se.\n\n\u201cU.S. intelligence officials and several private-sector cybersecurity firms believe the accord led to a real decline in Chinese espionage, but that the malicious activity has returned since Mr. Trump took office as hostilities over trade and other issues have escalated,\u201d the Journal added.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions referenced Xi\u2019s 2015 pledge to avoid cyberespionage on Thursday and said, \u201cObviously, that commitment has not been kept.\u201d Sessions went on to announce a new working group of top Justice Department officials known as the \u201cChina initiative\u201d that would work to counter Chinese infiltration of tech companies and universities.\n\nChina\u2019s state-run Global Times was absolutely infuriated by the ten indictments revealed on Tuesday, running a spate of articles criticizing the United States and claiming it was using cybersecurity as a pretext to wage legal warfare against Chinese companies as a protectionist strategy.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Global Times quoted Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang denouncing the indictments as \u201csheer fiction and completely fabricated.\u201d\n\nThe article went on to quote Chinese analysts who said the indictment merely offered a \u201clong narrative\u201d without any supporting evidence and claimed China cannot make use of stolen American and European aerospace technology in any event because Chinese aircraft are somehow unique.\n\nThe Global Times then ran an editorial slamming the Justice Department\u2019s allegations as part of an American \u201csmear campaign against China\u201d and pretended to be puzzled about why American authorities keep picking on the Chinese intelligence operation headquartered in Jiangsu province:\n\nThe US has made wrong accusations and hyped \u201cChinese spies\u201d in the past. It has become Washington\u2019s political and diplomatic measure to express its attitude toward Beijing. Continuous US accusations against the Jiangsu security authorities are obviously coordinated with Washington\u2019s policy adjustment toward China. This is a political action disguised as a judicial one. The latest accusation is part of the campaign which also includes the US Department of Commerce\u2019s decision to block China\u2019s Fujian Jinhua from buying US components and high-ranking US officials\u2019 claims that there are many spies among Chinese students in the US, slandering China for infringing US intellectual property rights. The US is promoting political mobilization against China and so pressuring Beijing.\n\nThe Global Times also portrayed the hotly disputed Bloomberg News expose of Chinese spy chips implanted on motherboards sold in the United States as collusion between the Trump administration and the media to create \u201ca false impression that the Chinese government is organizing commercial espionage against the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose radical US elites arrogantly believe that China stole its modernization from the US and every Chinese person looks like a spy to them,\u201d the Global Times fulminated. \u201cAs China and the US share a wide and complicated exchange, such extreme thinking is harmful. It not only hurts the two countries\u2019 normal exchanges but also threatens the safety of innocent people and leads to miscarriages of justice.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese paper suggested China\u2019s intelligence apparatus should retaliate by exposing U.S. espionage in China to \u201clet the world see U.S. spies\u2019 behavior.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the Global Times claimed the world is closing ranks around Beijing to thwart President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cunilateralism to try to alter the international trade system,\u201d in particular his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the tough sanctions about to take effect against Iran.\n\nThe Times speculated that even China\u2019s longtime regional rivals India and Japan will realign themselves toward Beijing if the Trump administration does not grant them exemptions from Iran sanctions. It portrayed Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s recent visit to China as the Japanese leader coming with hat in hand to beg the Chinese to forgive his \u201canti-China campaigns, including a key role in the Obama administration\u2019s pivot to Asia strategy and worldwide bluster for direct competition with Chinese overseas infrastructure investment.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the Global Times asserted Abe has realized Japanese competition with China\u2019s Belt and Road infrastructure project is futile and predicted India will get with the program as well.\n\n\u201cAn unpredictable Trump administration is changing the perception of threat of major powers. To countries that are friendly to the US, an obvious source of threat is China, because they worry that a rising China would change the status quo. But now Trump has smacked them right in the face when his foreign policies have changed the status quo thoroughly to cause collateral damage, or worse, direct damage. India and Japan won\u2019t be the last ones, more states will choose to soft-balance the U.S.,\u201d the Global Times concluded.", "Two Florida high school students who discovered their teacher slept with both of them were so furious at hearing the news, they told the teacher\u2019s wife, school district officials said.\n\nBoth teenagers, who used to be students at Fletcher High School in Neptune Beach, told police they had sex with the teacher, Corey French, 30, at the school and his home on separate occasions during their time at the school, according to a Duval County School District administrative report obtained by WJXT.\n\nThe female students, who are 16 and 17 years old, said once they found out French had been in a sexual relationship with the two of them, they confronted his wife, giving her photographic evidence of the sexual encounters, according to the report.\n\nAuthorities arrested French in September on two counts of unlawful sexual activity. The Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement both girls told authorities they had consensual sex with the teacher while he taught at Fletcher High School between 2015 and 2017.\n\nDuval County School District officials heard about the allegations in March, and removed him from the classroom not too long after learning of the allegations, WJAX reported.\n\n\u201cFollowing that notification, Mr. French was immediately pulled from his classroom responsibility and assigned to a temporary role with no student contact,\u201d district officials said in a statement. \u201cMr. French resigned from his teaching position upon notification of the district\u2019s recommendation of termination.\u201d\n\nFrench, who had worked for the district for four years, pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and is free on bond.

Near Pakistan, nations like Afghanistan, India, China, and Iran have extensive histories of persecuting Christians.\n\nBibi, a Roman Catholic, was arrested in 2009 after a dispute with Muslim colleagues, who accused her of tainting a cup of water by drinking from it as a Christian. The prosecution against Bibi alleged that she responded to abuse from her colleagues by insulting Islam\u2019s Muhammad, a crime carrying the death penalty in Pakistan. She was found guilty and sentenced to hanging in 2010 and remained on death row until Wednesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pakistan\u2019s Supreme Court acquitted Bibi, asserting the witnesses who testified to her blasphemy had lied and, by using Islam to defame others, had committed their own crime of blasphemy. Chowdhry told Breitbart News that Bibi remains in prison while the bureaucratic process to formalize her release occurs.\n\nIn response to the ruling, thousands of Islamists, most of the radical Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan Party (TLP), took to the streets of Islamabad and other major cities demanding her death and the death of the three judges who freed her.

In about 24 hours, agents apprehended nearly 100 from Central American countries including families and unaccompanied minors.\n\nWeslaco Station agents working near the border town of Hidalgo, Texas, encountered one large group of migrants on Tuesday evening. Agents said the group gathered along the U.S. side of the Rio Grande border with Mexico before moving out to find a law enforcement officer so they could surrender, according to Border Patrol officials.\n\nThe Border Patrol agents rounded up the migrants and placed them into custody, officials stated. The agents interviewed the group of 30 and learned they came to the U.S. without documentation from Guatemala.\n\nThe following day, Weslaco Station agents came upon another large group near the Hidalgo Pump House, officials stated. The agents took the 69 migrants, mostly from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, into custody for immigration violations. Many of those apprehended are expected to request asylum and will likely be released.\n\nIn a separate incident on Wednesday morning, Breitbart News reported that Weslaco Station agents apprehended another group of 74 migrants. This group was also found near Hidalgo, Texas, officials stated.\n\nThe apprehension of these large groups of migrants comes as a third caravan is bound for the U.S. from Central America, Breitbart News reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe third group appears to be made up of about 2,000 Salvadorans including men, women, and children. The first two caravans organized earlier in October created tension between the migrants and border officials in Mexico and Guatemala.\n\nWhen the caravan migrants arrive, they will add to a system that is already overwhelmed by the continuing flow of Central American migrants.\n\nDuring Fiscal Year 2018, Border Patrol agents witnessed a 30 percent increase in the number apprehensions between ports of entry along the U.S. border with Mexico. During the fourth quarter of the just-ended fiscal year, officials reported an 80 percent increase in the numbers of Family Unit Aliens.\n\nThe Rio Grande Valley Sector in South Texas continues to lead the nation in the apprehension of Family Unit Aliens (FMUA) and Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC). The sector witnessed a 27 percent increase in the number of FMUAs apprehended in 2018 compared to the previous fiscal year, officials reported. The number of families apprehended jumped from 49,896 in FY2017 to 63,278.", "The founder of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, stated in a recent interview that tech giants such as Google and Facebook have become so dominant in the online landscape that they may need to be broken up.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, the founder of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, discussed the growing dominance of tech giants such as Google and Facebook stating that he believes it may be necessary at some point to break these companies up.

charged a state-owned Chinese company, a Taiwanese company, and three individuals with stealing trade secrets from a U.S. semiconductor company, the Justice Department announced Thursday.\n\n\u201cI am announcing that a grand jury in San Francisco has returned a multi-defendant indictment alleging economic espionage on the part of a state-owned Chinese company, a Taiwanese company, and three Taiwan individuals for an alleged scheme to steal trade secrets from Micron, an Idaho-based semi-conductor company,\u201d said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \u201cMicron is worth an estimated $100 billion and has a 20 to 25 percent share of the dynamic random access memory industry\u2014a technology not possessed by the Chinese until very recently. As this and other recent cases have shown, Chinese economic espionage against the United States has been increasing\u2014and it has been increasing rapidly.\u201d\n\nOne of the companies indicted is Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co, a state-owned firm that is central to Beijing\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d scheme to dominate new high-technology industries. This week the Commerce Department said it had put Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit on a list of entities that cannot buy components, software, and technology goods from U.S. firms.\n\nThe Department of Justice described the scheme:\n\nAccording to the indictment, the defendants were engaged in a conspiracy to steal the trade secrets of Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron), a leader in the global semiconductor industry specializing in the advanced research, development, and manufacturing of memory products, including dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). DRAM is a leading-edge memory storage device used in computer electronics. Micron is the only United States-based company that manufactures DRAM. According to the indictment, Micron maintains a significant competitive advantage in this field due in large part from its intellectual property, including its trade secrets that include detailed, confidential information pertaining to the design, development, and manufacturing of advanced DRAM products. Prior to the events described in the indictment, the PRC did not possess DRAM technology, and the Central Government and State Council of the PRC publicly identified the development of DRAM and other microelectronics technology as a national economic priority. The criminal defendants are United Microelectronics Corporation (\u201cUMC\u201d), a Taiwan semiconductor foundry; Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, Co., Ltd. (\u201cJinhua\u2019\u201d), a state-owned enterprise of the PRC; and three Taiwan nationals: Chen Zhengkun, a.k.a. Stephen Chen, age 55; He Jianting, a.k.a. J.T. Ho, age 42; and Wang Yungming, a.k.a. Kenny Wang, age 44. UMC is a publicly listed semiconductor foundry company traded on the New York Stock Exchange; is headquartered in Taiwan; and has offices worldwide, including in Sunnyvale, California. UMC mass produces integrated-circuit logic products based on designs and technology developed and provided by its customers. Jinhua is a state-owned enterprise of the PRC, funded entirely by the Chinese government, and established in February 2016 for the sole purpose of designing, developing, and manufacturing DRAM. According to the indictment, Chen was a General Manager and Chairman of an electronics corporation that Micron acquired in 2013. Chen then became the president of a Micron subsidiary in Taiwan, Micron Memory Taiwan (\u201cMMT\u201d), responsible for manufacturing at least one of Micron\u2019s DRAM chips. Chen resigned from MMT in July 2015 and began working at UMC almost immediately. While at UMC, Chen arranged a cooperation agreement between UMC and Fujian Jinhua whereby, with funding from Fujian Jinhua, UMC would transfer DRAM technology to Fujian Jinhua to mass-produce. The technology would be jointly shared by both UMC and Fujian Jinhua. Chen later became the President of Jinhua and was put in charge of its DRAM production facility. While at UMC, Chen recruited numerous MMT employees, including Ho and Wang, to join him at UMC. Prior to leaving MMT, Ho and Wang both stole and brought to UMC several Micron trade secrets related to the design and manufacture of DRAM. Wang downloaded over 900 Micron confidential and proprietary files before he left MMT and stored them on USB external hard drives or in personal cloud storage, from where he could access the technology while working at UMC.\n\nSeparately, Sessions announced a new Department of Justice initiative to combat Chinese economic espionage.\n\n\u201cWe are here today to say: enough is enough. We\u2019re not going to take it anymore,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cThis Department of Justice\u2014and the Trump administration\u2014have already made our decision: we will not allow our sovereignty to be disrespected, our intellectual property to be stolen, or our people to be robbed of their hard-earned prosperity.

Blackburn, as the chairman of the House Communications and Technology Subcommittee, has held hearings and called for regulation to prevent online censorship of conservative and alternative voices.\n\nBlackburn told Breitbart News in an interview in June that social media companies need regulation to prevent their censorship practices.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on making certain that we look at these violations and make certain that we schedule the proper oversight and proper hearings; we want to be certain that they don\u2019t censor conservatives,\u201d Blackburn said.", "In a Thursday speech in the Republican-leaning suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia, Oprah Winfrey urged voters to make history by backing Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams in next week\u2019s election, saying she refuses to allow the sacrifices of those who were \u201clynched\u201d and \u201coppressed\u201d to be \u201cin vain.\u201d\n\nOprah: \u201cI'm here today because of the men and because of the women who were lynched, who were humiliated, who were discriminated against, who were suppressed, who were repressed and oppressed \u2026 I refuse to let their sacrifices be in vain.\" pic.twitter.com/9ijjOWkLv5 \u2014 NBCBLK (@NBCBLK) November 1, 2018\n\nAbrams is locked in a tight race with her Republican rival, Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp, as she tries to become the nation\u2019s first black female governor.\n\nOprah Winfrey praised Abrams as a \u201cchange-maker\u201d who represents the values of all Georgians.

Such movement has caused considerable tension and xenophobic backlash in local communities, an issue the spread of disease is only likely to exacerbate.\n\nLast month, Ecuador\u2019s leftist President Lenin Moreno, who some believed would be an ally of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, told the United Nations General Assembly that his country was taking in an average of 6,000 Venezuelan refugees a day, many with infectious diseases.\n\n\u201cIn Ecuador, we are receiving at least 6,000 Venezuelan brothers daily,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cThe children come with chickenpox, with diphtheria and polio; pregnant women come having never taken birth control.\u201d\n\nThe Maduro regime reacted angrily to the claim, with Venezuela\u2019s ambassador in Quito calling Moreno a \u201cliar,\u201d an insult that eventually led to his expulsion from the country.\n\nThe collapse in health services and resources remains one of the gravest aspects of Venezuela\u2019s current predicament, where a socialist dictatorship has transformed this once wealthy nation into one of the poorest country\u2019s in the world.\n\nUnder the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s \u201cBolivarian Revolution,\u201d the government enshrined state-provided healthcare into his version of the Venezuelan constitution. However, the inevitable collapse of its economy has left the government effectively bankrupt, meaning there is little to no money for hospitals most basic healthcare services.\n\nIn June, Venezuelan officials recorded the first case of polio in 30 years, while other previously eradicated health problems such as diphtheria also begin to re-emerge. Last May, public health statistics revealed that over 11,000 children under the age of one died in the year 2016, with figures likely to have significantly worsened since then.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "CNN personality Wolf Blitzer said Thursday that an ad about an illegal alien killer released by President Trump was \u201cawful\u201d and that he didn\u2019t even want to play it on air.\n\n\u201cYou look at the rest of the video and, I don\u2019t want to even play it, and give free advertising to those out there, but if you look at the rest of it, you see hoards of invaders, coming into\u2013threatening to come into the United States, tearing down walls and fences and threatening the American people.

During his speech at Freedom Tower in Miami, Florida, Bolton declared that the \u201cTroika of Tyranny\u201d would fall with support from the Trump administration.\n\nBolton specifically announced new sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s oil industry and executive measures to prevent Americans from doing business with the Cuban military regime, which controls most of the Cuban economy, including its tourism sector.\n\n\u201cI am here to deliver a clear message from the president \u2026 to those three regimes,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cWe will not reward torturers, murderers, and abusers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis Troika of Tyranny, this triangle of terror stretching from Havana to Caracas to Managua, is the cause of immense human suffering, the impetus of enormous regional instability, and the genesis of a sordid cradle of communism in the Western Hemisphere,\u201d he declared, calling the extreme poverty and violence against pro-democracy voices in all three countries \u201cthe true results of socialism and communism.\u201d\n\nEchoing President Donald Trump, Bolton asserted that the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela \u2013 currently lacking nearly all necessary medical supplies for a functional healthcare system and home to a growing hunger problem \u2013 is happening because \u201csocialism was implemented successfully.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder this administration, we will no longer appease dictators and despots near our shores in this Hemisphere. We will not reward firing squads, torturers, and murderers. We will champion the independence and liberty of our neighbors,\u201d he continued.\n\nBolton went on to give the countries another nickname: \u201cthe Three Stooges of Socialism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are pathetic clowns that resemble Larry, Curly, and Moe, three absurd comedians,\u201d he told the Miami audience to cheers.\n\nBolton also promised \u201cconcrete measures\u201d against the regimes, starting with a ban on U.S. transactions with Cuban military corporations and sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s gold industry. Bolton added the administration promised further sanctions down the line and would work to freeze access of the elites of the three countries to stolen assets hidden in the United States.\n\nBolton also took a moment to thank conservative governments in South America for their support, applauding Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque and Brazilian President-elect Jair Bolsonaro personally as \u201cpositive signs for the future of the region.\u201d\n\nThe administration, he promised, would fight terror \u201cin Pittsburgh or Caracas\u201d and, unlike President Barack Obama, he said, \u201cno one in this administration will take a photo in front of Che Guevara.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not glamorize Marxist guerrilla fighters,\u201d he added, promising \u201cno selfies\u201d with communist oppressors.\n\nPresident Trump has vocally opposed the communist regime in Cuba long before being a candidate for office. In a 1999 Miami Herald article, for example, he confessed that he had received offers to build a Trump hotel in Havana. \u201cI had a choice to make: huge profits or human rights. For me, it was a no-brainer,\u201d he wrote. He made reversing President Barack Obama\u2019s appeasement policy towards the Castro regime a pillar of his 2016 campaign, earning him the first-ever presidential endorsement from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association in October 2016.\n\nIn office, the president has repeatedly prioritized fighting socialism in Latin America. One of his first acts as president was to welcome Lilian Tintori, wife of Venezuelan political prisoner Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, to the Oval Office. His National Security Strategy, published in December 2017, explicitly detailed how Venezuela and Cuba pose a threat to American national security interests.\n\n\u201cIn Venezuela and Cuba, governments cling to anachronistic leftist authoritarian models that continue to fail their people,\u201d the strategy read. \u201cCompetitors have found operating space in the hemisphere. China seeks to pull the region into its orbit through state-led investments and loans. Russia continues its failed politics of the Cold War by bolstering its radical Cuban allies as Cuba continues to repress its citizens.\u201d\n\nTrump also appeared to heighten the importance of fighting communism in the region by bringing Bolton on board as national security adviser. In an interview with Univisi\u00f3n this year, he praised Bolton for having \u201cworked very well,\u201d and that he \u201cis very in favor of the struggle in Cuba and Venezuela for justice.\u201d\n\nYears of research by security NGOs, journalists, and geopolitical experts have unveiled the deep ties between Venezuela and Cuba. Venezuela is believed to be run by an army of at least 93,000 Cuban government and military officials working in the country, according to a retired Venezuelan general who defected from the regime. Former Venezuelan political prisoners and defecting government officials have provided evidence that Cubans largely control the country\u2019s security apparatus, including Maduro\u2019s personal security and the most sophisticated political prisons and torture centers in the country.\n\n\u201cWithout the direct tutelage of Ra\u00fal Castro, his military junta, the Communist Party of Cuba, the Revolutionary Armed Forces, and the entire intelligence and counterintelligence apparatus of the Castro \u2026 the government of Maduro would have succumbed already,\u201d a 2017 report by the Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba concluded.\n\nVenezuela and Cuba also share ties to other rogue states, such as Iran, jeopardizing American interests in the hemisphere. A 2014 report by the Secure Free Society revealed that Cuba and Venezuela conspired to offer legal documents \u2013 passports, visas, and permits \u2013 to mostly Shiite migrants from the Middle East believed to have ties to Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s proxy terrorist organization. Spanish journalist Emili J. Blasco revealed in his book Boomerang Ch\u00e1vez that while in a meeting dictator Bashar al-Assad facilitated, Maduro assured leader Hassan Nasrallah that he would help Hezbollah.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "A \u201csex robot brothel\u201d is raising funds to open in California next year, where men will reportedly be able to pay $10,000 to take a sex robot\u2019s \u201cvirginity.\u201d\n\nThe brothel, named Eve\u2019s Robot Dreams, is set to open in West Hollywood, California, next year if it raises $155,000 from a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo.\n\n\u201cAt this brothel, people can experience cutting edge technology in a clean and futuristic environment\u2026 Everything from the lighting to the furniture is designed to transport you into a fantasy world where you can explore things you never thought you\u2019d get a chance to explore,\u201d claimed Eve\u2019s Robot Dreams CEO Unicole Unicron in an interview with the Daily Star. \u201cOften times men treat these dolls the same way a child treats their dolls\u2026 They dress them up and have entire conversations with them.

It also stresses how dangerous it was to give the terror masters of Iran huge amounts of money with President Barack Obama\u2019s nuclear deal, money that could be passed along to destabilizing Iranian proxies across the Middle East.\n\nU.S. envoy to Syria Joel Rayburn on Friday called Hezbollah\u2019s activities a \u201chighly destabilizing prospect,\u201d noting that Iran is not merely interested in wrapping up the Syrian civil war by turning the last few effective rebel militia forces against each other.\n\n\u201cThe idea that Hezbollah would be expanding its presence down there on the Jordanian frontier, near the Golan Heights, near the Israeli frontier. This would increase the chance for conflict,\u201d Rayburn warned.\n\nThe WSJ pointed out that Iran is doing a lot more than hiring a few mercenaries:\n\nIn a sign of further efforts to deepen its presence in the area, Iran in late October established a branch of a Shiite religious organization, al-Zahra, in the southern province of Daraa, following a visit to the area by a representative of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, according to ETANA Syria, a civil society organization that monitors southern Syria. For former rebels, joining Hezbollah provides a guarantee against arrest by the Syrian government. It also pays a $250 monthly salary, more than the Syrian army gives and compensation for lost income from U.S. support for their organizations.\n\nThe joke might be on Russia, which assumed Syria would move firmly into its orbit after Russian warplanes saved Assad\u2019s throne. The WSJ report saw signs the Russians expected Iran to pull out after accomplishing its objectives and underestimated how quickly Hezbollah would move to put down roots.\n\nEarlier in the Syrian conflict, the Pentagon assessed Iran\u2019s interest in Syria as developing \u201can effective deterrent against U.S. aggression on Iranian soil\u201d by developing a position along the Israeli border, but Emile Hokayem of the International Institute for Strategic Studies warned Iran plans to act aggressively and Hezbollah\u2019s turf in Lebanon and Syria will be \u201cthe fulcrum of their next conflict.\u201d\n\n\u201cHezbollah and Iran understand that the winning game is the ground game: you need to embed yourself in communities, you need to build a presence and be part of the local economy and infrastructure,\u201d Hokayem explained, delivering a news flash to Russian planners who thought Iran\u2019s mission in Syria was temporary and fully synchronized with Moscow\u2019s regional interests.\n\nIran is pursuing a similar strategy in Iraq, developing an explicitly religious ideological infrastructure that recruits young Shiites to establish a permanent sphere of influence. Iranian leaders are very big on condemning Sunni militants opposed to their agenda as takfiris, meaning fake Muslims.\n\nThese efforts do not rely entirely on Hezbollah or local proxies, as there are thousands of trained operatives from the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its militia subsidiaries active in Syria. The Iranians boost their manpower by aggressively recruiting fighters from Afghanistan and Pakistan, training them in Iran, and dispatching them to the front lines in hot spots like Syria. All of these techniques were refined during Hezbollah\u2019s ascent to dominance in Lebanon.\n\nSyria is such a bloody mess that Iran\u2019s short-term interests occasionally align with those of the United States, as on Wednesday when Iran-backed Shiite militia attacked the Islamic State jihadis who launched an offensive against the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nIn the short term, everyone except ISIS agrees that bombing ISIS is good policy. In the long term, Israel finds itself inside the horns of Iran\u2019s growing \u201cShiite crescent,\u201d menaced by an aggressive Iranian position in Syria whose growth seems as unstoppable as it is inevitable.\n\nThe only effective tool for rolling back Iran\u2019s influence currently in the Western policy toolbox is the powerful round of sanctions America is about to impose on Iran, draining away the money Tehran needs to finance its imperial ambitions\u2026 assuming Europe doesn\u2019t choose to undermine the sanctions and keep disposable income in the pockets of the ayatollahs.", "A new report shows that Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke has received some serious help from outside of Texas, with Hollywood stars from Chris Rock to Chelsea Handler opening their wallets to support his campaign.\n\nAccording to FEC filings, Beto O\u2019Rourke is getting donations from some of the biggest liberal celebrities in America.\n\n\u201cSarah Jessica Parker, Jimmy Kimmel and Rosie O\u2019Donnell have each thrown down $2,700 \u2026 while Chelsea Handler plunked down $2,500 and Chris Rock has tossed in $1,000.

Bolton is expected to detail not just the human rights crimes of the Castro regime but how Cuban officials have co-opted the governments of Venezuela and Nicaragua to bolster their own economic and political influence.\n\nCongress granted Americans who had their property stolen by Fidel Castro in the aftermath of the Cuban Revolution the right to sue the Cuban government in 1996 under the law known as the Helms-Burton Act. The executive branch, typically through the White House or State Department, has blocked lawsuits from going through since the law passed, however, presumably out of fear that the legal action would alienate allies that still do business with Cuba and traffic in the stolen property disputed by the lawsuits. A Helms-Burton provision allows \u201csue foreign companies with businesses in the U.S. that have also invested in those properties on the island,\u201d McClatchy details.\n\nAccording to McClatchy, Cuban-American lawmakers Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL) have participated in efforts to help empower the American victims of the Cuban revolution. Rubio, in particular, has reportedly pushed for allowing the lawsuits, while both allegedly support returning the power to allow the lawsuits to the White House from the State Department.\n\nThe report notes that the United States has certified almost 6,000 property claims against the Castro regime.\n\nMost estimates place the value of American stolen property in Cuba at $8 billion, featuring a variety of assets including farmland, ports, factories, and businesses, but not the value of artifacts stolen from the homes of Cuban exiles and Americans forced to choose between fleeing the country, relegation to labor camps, or the firing squad. As attorney Jason Poblete details in the American Spectator:\n\nAs a matter of Cuban law, the 1959 Communist takeover and theft of U.S. and other property was illegal. Indeed, the first official act of the Fidel regime was to cancel the Cuban constitution. For added drama, on that same day, it murdered close to 100 persons associated with the prior government. After destroying rule of law, it went after the Americans and the religious, principally the Catholics, by using property confiscations.\n\nMuch like the controversy surrounding Congress permitting lawsuits against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its role in harboring the terrorists behind the September 11, 2001, attacks, those supporting suspending the lawsuits argue that they challenge sovereign immunity, which broadly prevents individuals from suing governments in American courts, though exceptions exist. With the Cuba lawsuits, opponents expressed concern that not only would Cuba be affected, but nations like Canada and European nations with close business ties to the Castro regime would also find themselves defendants for profiting off the stolen property. This was the argument that initially led President Donald Trump to continue extending suspensions on Helms-Burton suits when he came into office.\n\nConcerns today would involve not just foreign companies, but American companies profiting from stolen property, thanks to changes in U.S.-Cuba policy under Barack Obama. Obama\u2019s policy of concessions towards the Castro regime resulted in American cruise lines cutting deals with the Cuban government to be allowed to use their ports and offer stops on the island. The first American cruise ship to dock in Havana, the Carnival Cruise Line \u201cAdonia\u201d ship, docked in May 2016.\n\nThe rightful owners of both docks in Havana and eastern Santiago de Cuba have demanded the ability to fight to regain their property, \u201cexpropriated\u201d in some cases by Fidel Castro personally in the 1960s. In conversations with Breitbart News, several such owners expressed particular dismay at the reality that American companies can use the property of U.S. citizens stolen by a rogue regime with impunity.\n\nIt remains unclear how any lifting of restrictions on Helms-Burton claims would affect American cruise lines. Cuban-American advocacy groups, united under the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance coalition, are planning a large-scale protest in Miami against the cruise lines scheduled to occur in peak vacation season.\n\nThe McClatchy report on the lawsuits was published shortly before the aforementioned Bolton remarks. While the text of Bolton\u2019s speech is not available at press time, he is expected to announce a new policy against Cuba and its proxies in Venezuela and Nicaragua.\n\nThe United States delegation at the United States has also worked to add amendments to an annual U.N. resolution rejecting the embargo on the communist regime that explicitly condemn Cuba for its decades of flagrant human rights abuses. The U.S. is scheduled to vote on the entire resolution, including the amendments, on Thursday.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "During the past summer Sen.

The first question on ATF background check form 4473 deals with straw purchases and makes the buyer affirm that he is indeed buying the gun for himself.\n\nThe only school shooting that involved straw purchases was Columbine, April 20, 1999. So Tester\u2019s straw purchase gun control would not have stopped, much less hindered, any school shooting in the 21st century.

A series of stories I\u2019d published with Andrew\u2019s then-relatively unknown website Breitbart.com was first a hit in right-wing media circles, then bled into the far-left New York Times and Washington Post after the series forced the resignation of an Obama Administration appointee. It was a thrilling time. Andrew was helping me change the world from my kitchen counter.\n\nBut even after being attacked by a few from Movie City as a result of the stories, I wasn\u2019t ready to concede Andrew\u2019s point about the people running Hollywood. They simply didn\u2019t seem as bad as he described. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong.\n\nJust a few years later I would find myself trapped inside what I can only describe as an uber-elite Tinseltown cult \u2013 a group of some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest players that were committed liberal supremacists. We were mistakenly accepted into the club before knowing their beliefs. But once they had learned we were filthy conservatives, it became apparent that the group would rather see my family\u2019s lives turned upside down then spend a single second in the presence of Trump-supporting Deplorables.\n\nIn a kind of Hail Mary, my wife and I decided to include an abridged version of our experience with these people in a story we were working on for Breitbart News called Tinseltown Travelogue \u2013 in hopes that someone, anyone, from this leftist cult would talk some sense into the larger community so we wouldn\u2019t have to completely uproot our family.\n\nWhat was perhaps most surprising was that our trouble started when we confronted a father from our community for getting in bed with other people\u2019s kids. In the city where the #MeToo movement was born \u2013 you\u2019d think Hollywood elites would have rallied to our position. Who in the hell would back a man who admittedly napped with children that weren\u2019t his own? The people of Hollywood, that\u2019s who. The swiftness of their turn showed the decision to back the kid cuddler over right-wingers was a no brainer.\n\nThe entire experience taught us something. First, Andrew was right: These people were really, really not good people. But it also taught us something a bit more connected to this particular moment in time. Hollywood is entirely uninterested in hearing our side of the story. If these Tinseltown elites weren\u2019t willing to hear the story of right-wingers that were actively trying to protect the kids in their community, what chance does someone off of Main Street have in getting their story heard? That\u2019s why we decided to launch Red Pilled America \u2013 a new weekly storytelling podcast \u2013 to tell stories that Hollywood and the far-left mainstream media don\u2019t want you to hear. In our first episode premiering today, we take a look at the #MeToo movement through the lens of our experience with this Tinseltown cult. But this time we\u2019re telling the unabridged version \u2013 and we\u2019re naming names. When we confronted a man for getting in bed with other people\u2019s kids \u2013 some of Hollywood\u2019s finest either remained publicly silent or actively attempted to shut us up. It didn\u2019t work.\n\nStorytelling is completely dominated by the left. Conservatives don\u2019t have a chance in making a long-term impact on culture if they don\u2019t actively participate in this art form. As Andrew Breitbart once proclaimed to conservatives \u2013 \u201cpop culture matters.\u201d He gave me my first shot at storytelling, and I agree with my old friend.\n\nIt\u2019s time for us to take Andrew\u2019s insight seriously and not just mock liberal Hollywood\u2019s clownish behavior, but also create stuff that breaks the strangle hold that Tinseltown has on culture. We\u2019d like to think Red Pilled America is a step in that direction, and hope you will agree.\n\nPatrick Courrielche is a Breitbart News contributor, former applied-physicist, and co-host of Red Pilled America.

The first is how tone-deaf the media are to how they are perceived by a massive majority of the country, even by a plurality of their fellow Democrats.\n\nThe national media constantly harp about things like \u201cdivision\u201d and \u201cpartisanship\u201d but always do so within the context of bashing Republicans, specifically Trump.\n\nOne notable instance occurred on Monday when CNN\u2019s Don Lemon perfectly crystallized the establishment media\u2019s approach to \u201cunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to stop demonizing people,\u201d the left-wing Lemon said as his words that followed demonized white men: \u201cThe biggest terror threat in this country is white men \u2026 and we have to start doing something about them.\u201d\n\nThe other remarkable thing about this poll is that Trump is a politician, a position that cannot avoid a certain amount of divisiveness and partisanship.

In fact, the media are the bitterest of divisive partisans, an institution desperate to divide us on race, gender, and any other classification they can conjure up.\n\nThe good news is that voters see right through the media.\n\nIf nothing else, Trump has done this country a great service by forcing the media to reveal their true selves.

In response, Cooper and Toobin attacked Kobach with unrelated insults.\n\nCooper even question if Kobach was a constitutional scholar, though he admitted that Kobach had graduated from Yale Law School, a school he says he could have never gotten accepted to.\n\n\u201cSo your critics say, are you really a legal scholar,\u201d Cooper told Kobach. \u201cI know you did go to Yale Law School and I certainly didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t even get in, not that I applied, but I know I couldn\u2019t if I had.\u201d\n\nAnd after defending his record of teaching constitutional law for 15 years at the University of Minnesota, Toobin accused Kobach of supporting voter ID laws in order to prevent black Americans from voting in elections.\n\n\u201cKris has devoted his career to stopping black people and poor people from voting,\u201d Toobin claimed. \u201cI mean that\u2019s been your goal for decades.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is an absolutely outrageous accusation,\u201d Kobach hit back. \u201cSo if you are \u2026 if you like photo ID, you\u2019re trying to stop people of color from voting.\u201d\n\nTo which Toobin responded, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is outrageous,\u201d Kobach said. \u201cAnd by the way, the vast \u2026 when this question is polled, the vast majority of African Americans approve of photo ID. So apparently they\u2019re trying to do what you\u2019re saying I\u2019m trying to do. That is outrageous and it\u2019s such a horrible accusation.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Gallup\u2018s most recent polling shows that 4-in-5 American voters, or about 80 percent, support the voter ID laws that Kobach has championed. A large majority of 95 percent of Republicans, 63 percent of Democrats, and 83 percent of Independent voters all support the voter ID\u2019s that Toobin claims are racist.\n\nThat same Gallup poll reveals that Kobach is correct in that 77 percent of black Americans and Hispanic Americans support voter ID laws.\n\nIn Alabama\u2019s recent statewide Senate election last year, it was proven that the state\u2019s newly adopted voter ID law did not suppress black American turnout. To the contrary, black Americans turned out in droves to support Democrat Doug Jones in the race.\n\nSee the full transcript of the CNN segment here:\n\nKOBACH: The key is \u2018and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u2019 As Jeffrey knows, all words in the Constitution have meaning. You can\u2019t read words out of the Constitution. And so the question is, what does \u2018and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\u2019 mean? And if you look at the debate, it\u2019s in 1866 and 1867 in the Congress, which drafted the 14th Amendment \u2026 they said it means \u2018owing no allegiance to any foreign power, owing allegiance only to the United States.\u2019 And that would mean that a person who is here temporarily, or certainly a person who is here illegally \u2026 owes allegiance to another power. In other words, is not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Those words have meaning. It was never intended to be if you\u2019re born here and no other criteria is met, you get to become a citizen. COOPER: Kris, your critics point out that the voter law that you tried to pass in your state was actually ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge \u2026 so your critics say, are you really a legal scholar. I know you did go to Yale Law School and I certainly didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t even get in, not that I applied, but I know I couldn\u2019t if I had. But your critics say that you\u2019re not an expert on the Constitution either. In fact, you were ordered to go to six hours of extra classes on the law by the federal judge. KOBACH: I taught Constitutional Law at the University of Missouri for 15 years. It is often the case, in cases like this that are very controversial and where there are some grey areas in the law, that a judge will have an opinion and that judge will be overruled and then the Supreme Court will rule on it as well. I think Jeffrey would agree that just because you have a district judge who doesn\u2019t agree with you on a case doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re not going to see a different decision come out of the Court of Appeals. That case is being appealed. And the position that the judge took, by the way, that a state cannot require voters to prove citizenship when they register, that argument was rejected by the Ninth Circuit about 10 years ago. TOOBIN: Kris has devoted his career to stopping black people and poor people from voting. I mean that\u2019s been your goal for decades. KOBACH: That is an outrageous accusation. TOOBIN: It\u2019s completely true. KOBACH: That is an absolutely outrageous accusation. So if you are \u2026 if you like photo ID, you\u2019re trying to stop people of color from voting. TOOBIN: Absolutely. KOBACH: That is outrageous. And by the way, the vast \u2026 when this question is polled, the vast majority of African Americans approve of photo ID. So apparently they\u2019re trying to do what you\u2019re saying I\u2019m trying to do. That is outrageous and it\u2019s such a horrible accusation. TOOBIN: It is a completely true accusation because Kris, your whole career \u2026 that\u2019s what you had this phony voter suppression commission that was such a preposterous joke established by the President that it disbanded because it couldn\u2019t prove your claim that voter fraud is a problem in this country. Your problem is that some people vote for Democrats and you want to stop that by establishing voter requirements.

Joe Manchin\u2019s (D-WV) lead continues to slip in the final weeks of the increasingly competitive Senate race, according to multiple polls released on Thursday.\n\nIn a poll released by the West Virginia Metro News, Sen.

The poll has a five margin of error, making the West Virginia Senate race nearly a statistical tie.\n\nThe last version of the poll in August showed a more significant gap between Manchin and Morrisey\u2014in August, Manchin led by eight points over the West Virginia conservative.\n\nRex Repass, the pollster who conducted the Metro News survey, suggested that the appointment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and President Donald J. Trump\u2019s multiple visits to the Mountain State have spurred voter interest in the Senate race.\n\n\u201cIt could be a higher turnout this year because of just a tremendous amount of interest in the U.S. Senate race in West Virginia,\u201d Repass said. \u201cPart of that was spurred by the Kavanaugh debate, part was because of President Trump being in the state multiple times for Patrick Morrisey.\u201d\n\nRepass also contended that the two Senate candidates will have to try to keep their bases\u2019 interest in voting high to win the contentious Senate election.\n\n\u201cI think opinions of who you support are solidified,\u201d Repass continued. \u201cThis is a closing argument. It\u2019s also rallying the base, making sure that those who are enthusiastic have already voted or will vote.\u201d\n\nAnother survey released on Thursday from Emerson College showed a tightening gap between Morrisey and the incumbent Democrat. The poll revealed that Manchin only leads by five points\u201447 to 42 percent\u2014against Morrisey, while Hollen has three percent, and eight percent of voters remain undecided. The poll has a 3.2 percent margin of error.\n\nWest Virginia third district Republican candidate Carol Miller leads against Democrat Richard Ojeda by seven percent, with 52 percent of West Virginians supporting Mille, 45 percent supporting Ojeda, and three percent of voters still undecided.\n\nMorrisey slammed Manchin in an interview last week with Breitbart News Daily, contending that when Democrats such as Manchin offer amnesty, it serves as \u201cwelcome invitation\u201d for more migrant caravans and illegal immigrants.\n\nMorrisey told West Virginians at a rally this week President Trump has helped him close the gap with the incumbent Democrat.\n\n\u201cEvery race I run, I close the deal,\u201d Morrisey charged. \u201cPresident Trump is coming back to West Virginia.

Guess again,\u201d Reid famously said at the time. \u201cIf you break our laws by entering our country without permission to give birth to a child, we reward that child with U.S. citizenship and guarantee a full access to all public and social services this society provides, and that\u2019s a lot of services.\u201d", "JERUSALEM (AFP) \u2013 Brazil\u2019s president-elect Jair Bolsonaro has told an Israeli newspaper he intends to defy the Palestinians and most of the world by moving his country\u2019s embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nBrazil would become the second major country after the United States to do so.\n\nAsked in an interview with Israel Hayom published Thursday if he would move Brazil\u2019s embassy, as he had indicated during his campaign, Bolsonaro said Israel should decide where its capital is located.\n\n\u201cWhen I was asked during the campaign if I\u2019d do it when I became president, I said \u2018yes, the one who decides on the capital of Israel is you, not other nations\u2019,\u201d he told the paper, which is a firm backer of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIsrael considers the entire city its capital, while the Palestinians see east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, with international consensus being that the status of the whole city must be negotiated between the two sides.\n\nIn December, President Donald Trump reversed longstanding US policy and recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, prompting Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas to boycott his administration.\n\nThe embassy was officially transferred on May 14, with Guatemala and Paraguay following suit, though the latter announced last month it would return its embassy to Tel Aviv.\n\nBolsonaro, 63, who won a run-off election on Sunday, has outraged many with his overtly misogynistic, homophobic and racist rhetoric.\n\nFollowing his victory, Netanyahu told Bolsonaro he was certain his election \u201cwill lead to a great friendship between our peoples and the tightening of links between Brazil and Israel.\u201d\n\nAn official in Netanyahu\u2019s office told AFP the Israeli premier was \u201cvery likely\u201d to attend Bolsonaro\u2019s inauguration ceremony in January.", "A Conservative Party member of the House of Lords has called for hate preachers and jihadi brides to be tried for treason, decrying the \u201cinadequate sentence\u201d of recently-released Islamic State supporter Anjem Choudary.\n\nFormer Justice Minister Lord Faulks QC called for an amendment to the Counter Terrorism and Security Bill in the Upper House of Parliament on Wednesday, adding an offence of treason to adequately punish those \u201cwaging war against your own country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who live and benefit from life in the United Kingdom yet involve themselves in attacks against the United Kingdom either here or abroad are surely guilty of treason,\u201d the Peer said.\n\n\u201cAre we too timid to call it that?

It is known that all around the world people living near wind parks often experience health issues \u2013 some being severe. The group led by Prof. Vahl conducted an experiment to find out if infrasound has an effect on heart muscle strength. Under the measurement conditions, the force developed by isolated heart muscle was up to 20 percent less. The strength of the heart muscle is important in the event the aortic valve becomes caked up and thus more narrow. According to Dr. Vahl: \u201cThis changes the blood flow and the flow noise.\u201d Now researchers are discussing whether these changes can pose an additional risk to the function of the heart, the Allgemeine Zeitung reported. Citing the results, Prof. Vahl said: \u201cThe fundamental question of whether infrasound can affect the heart muscle has been answered.\u201d The researchers conclude: \u201cWe are at the very beginning, but we can imagine that long-term impact of infrasound causes health problems. The silent noise of infrasound acts like a heart jammer.\u201d\n\nThere has long been anecdotal evidence that wind turbines are injurious to human health. I first heard these stories myself on a visit to Australia in 2012 when I met several people who had experienced serious health problems from the effects of wind turbine infrasound \u2013 and had been forced to abandon their homes. Subsequently, I also spoke to people in the UK who were also victims of Wind Turbine Syndrome.\n\nYou can read the first report I wrote on the subject here.\n\nHere is a more recent one, full of useful links, titled: Donald Trump is so Right to Wage War on Wind Farms\n\nThe wind industry is a massive class action suit waiting to happen. [Especially now that the World Health Organisation has confirmed the health risks \u2013 which, of course, just like Big Tobacco, Big Wind has been covering up for years] Indeed, of all the scandals to emerge from the great global warming scam, the wind industry is in my view the worst.\n\nWind power is often billed as cheap, clean, wholesome and safe. In fact, it\u2019s very expensive, environmentally damaging, harmful to humans and animals \u2013 and pretty much useless in the war on climate change. But you don\u2019t get to read the truth very often in the credulous mainstream media which prefers to run the propaganda put out by extremely well-funded wind industry lobbyists.\n\nTypical is this farrago of drivel from the BBC.\n\nIt\u2019s titled: Reality Check: Which form of renewable energy is cheapest?\n\nWind \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 turns out to be the answer. Which isn\u2019t a particularly big deal when you think about it. The point about renewable energy is that all of it is dramatically more expensive than fossil fuel energy. So being the \u201ccheapest\u201d form of renewable energy is a bit like winning the prize for \u201cthinnest sumo wrestler\u201d or \u201cleast unpleasant Antifa activist\u201d or \u201csanest Remain voter\u201d: pretty meaningless in the great scheme of things.\n\nBylined \u201cReality Check team\u201d it gives the false impression of diligent research and careful fact-checking.\n\nBut as Paul Homewood points out it contains three misleading statements:\n\n1) Caroline Lucas claims that the government has \u201cvirtually banned onshore wind\u201d. As the BBC Complaints Dept has already been forced to categorically confirm, there is simply no truth in this. The government has simply ended subsidies and (shock, horror!!) allowed local communities to decide whether they want new wind farms or not. 2) These figures do account for construction costs and the fact that wind and solar power are intermittent This is typical of the lazy, slovenly writing we see so much of at the BBC, where climate change is concerned. The BEIS shows quite clearly that intermittency costs are not included in their costings. Nor, for that matter, are \u201cWhole System Impacts\u201d, such as new transmission lines. If the BBC are going to quote the BEIS report, should they at least take the time to read it properly? 3) Above all, there is this chart, showing onshore wind is cheaper than CCGT; What the BBC fails to point out is that the CCGT cost includes a totally artificial \u201ccarbon cost\u201d of \u00a319/MWh. Without this CCGT would be costing \u00a347/MWh. What the BBC and its friends in the Green Party never point out is that investment in new onshore wind projects has dried up to virtually zero since subsidies were withdrawn. If it really was so cheap, why does it still need subsidising?\n\nWhy does it still need subsidising? It\u2019s a question the wind industry is utterly incapable of answering because if it ever did so honestly the game would be up.\n\nThe wind industry is nothing more than a subsidy trough for rent-seekers.\n\nNo matter how much bigger wind turbines get, they\u2019ll still be producing unreliable, intermittent, hugely expensive power of no use to man nor beast.\n\nWind turbines are so bad indeed, they\u2019re like something that the Nazis might have dreamed up.

It destroyed thousands of centrifuges involved in Iran\u2019s controversial nuclear program at the Bushehr power plant by hijacking centrifuges and forcing them to operate at heightened speeds, which was detrimental to the enrichment process.\n\nIran moved in 2011 to boost its cybersecurity following the attack by the computer worm. The cyber attack was widely believed to have been be created through a partnership between the U.S. and Israel.\n\nThe latest claim of the reactivation of a simlar threat comes in the wake of a string of Israeli intelligence coups against Iran.

(Senate Republicans are up to 29 circuit judges.) Sens. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) plan to keep running up the score to more than 30 appeals judges before the end of this year, which when combined with two Supreme Court justices and also continuing to add trial judges in the district courts, means the Senate may confirm over 100 Trump judges by the end of 2018.\n\nBut for the majority of voters who support President Trump on judges, it is not just the number of judges appointed, but the legal philosophy of those judges. If the president were appointing milquetoast establishment Republicans it would demoralize his base, given his campaign promise to appoint jurists in the mold of the famed originalist, Justice Antonin Scalia. From moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, to his religious liberty executive order, to judges, President Trump has shown that he wants a hallmark of his presidential legacy to be that he keeps his promises.\n\nTwo recent decisions from different appeals courts demonstrate that President Trump is appointing judges with Scalia\u2019s judicial philosophy, and consequently that the vast reach of the federal government is in trouble. Both decisions concern two major doctrines from the Supreme Court under which federal judges defer to U.S. government agencies \u2013 doctrines that conservatives now sharply criticize, and that federal bureaucrats rely upon to exert sweeping power over American lives, businesses, and organizations.\n\nThe first doctrine is Auer deference, from the Supreme Court case Auer v. Robbins. The Court held in that 1997 case that when a federal agency makes regulations, if those regulations are later challenged in court and found to be ambiguous on an issue in the lawsuit, then courts should defer to any reasonable interpretation that the agency gives to those regulations.\n\nAuer was written by none other than Scalia. But as Justice Clarence Thomas frequently notes when giving speeches about his departed friend, Scalia later came to regard the very rule he created as a colossal Supreme Court mistake, and he believed it should be overruled.\n\nJudge Amul Thapar of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, who is also on the list of potential Trump Supreme Court nominees, weighed in against Auer on October 22 in a case challenging federal sentencing guidelines issued by the U.S. Sentencing Commission. The commission issued a comment interpreting the guidelines it had previously issued, then argued that the court should defer to its comment.\n\nAfter writing the majority opinion for the Sixth Circuit\u2019s three-judge panel, Thapar added a concurring opinion to the majority decision, beginning:\n\nUnder Auer, courts must defer to agencies\u2019 interpretations of their own rules\u2014including the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines. But one does not \u201cinterpret\u201d a text by adding to it. Interpreting a menu of \u201chot dogs, hamburgers, and bratwursts\u201d to include pizza is nonsense. Nevertheless, that is effectively what the government argues here when it says that we must apply deference to a comment adding to rather than interpreting the Guidelines. The government\u2019s argument shows how far Auer has come and will go if left unchecked by the courts. Under Auer, agencies possess immense power. Rather than simply enacting rules with the force of law, agencies get to decide what those rules mean, too. But just as a pitcher cannot call his own balls and strikes, an agency cannot trespass upon the court\u2019s province to \u201csay what the law is.\u201d \u2026 Not only that, but Auer incentivizes agencies to regulate \u201cbroadly and vaguely\u201d and later interpret those regulations self-servingly, all at the expense of the regulated.\n\n\u201cAs this is a criminal case, and applying Auer would extend Havis\u2019s time in prison, alarm bells should be going off,\u201d he continued, quoting James Madison from The Federalist No. 47, as well as Montesquieu. \u201cThe whole point of separating the federal government\u2019s powers in the first place was to protect individual liberty.\u201d\n\nThapar adds:\n\nThe government cannot be faulted for arguing for deference. But judges should be faulted for accepting the government\u2019s argument. How is it fair in a court of justice for judges to defer to one of the litigants? In essence, the argument boils down to this\u2014the government is populated by experts and when they speak we should tip the scales of justice in their favor. Such deference is found nowhere in the Constitution\u2014the document to which judges take an oath. And allowing such deference would allow the same agency to make the rules and interpret the rules. As noted above, this is contrary to any notion the founders had of separation of powers.\n\n\u201cAnd while it is true that Congress can provide checks on the agencies, this does not relieve the judiciary from also performing its role. Indeed, the founders envisioned a combined system of checks and balances,\u201d Thapar concludes, citing Madison again, this time in The Federalist No. 51. \u201cBut if the judiciary checks out, so to speak, then the system the founders envisioned crumbles.\u201d\n\nThe second Supreme Court doctrine highlighted by the Trump judges is Chevron deference, from Chevron USA v. Natural Resources Defense Council. The Court held in that 1984 case that if an agency is responsible for implementing a federal statute, and that if the statute is ambiguous on a certain point or silent on the issue, then federal courts should defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute so long as that interpretation seems reasonable.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch is on record as a sharp critic of Chevron, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh has expressed concerns as well.\n\nAdd Judge James Ho of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to that list. Ho wrote a concurring opinion in a charter school case where lawyers were arguing about whether to defer to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on the question of if the law administered by that agency, the National Labor Relations Act, applies to charter schools. That federal statute does not apply to states or their political subdivisions, including school districts, so the issue was whether charter schools are like public schools for purposes of the law.\n\n\u201cCharter schools are unambiguously private organizations, not political subdivisions. So I disagree with the Board\u2019s request for deference to the extent that it claims the power to reach the opposite result in another charter school case,\u201d Ho begins. \u201cI therefore write separately to make clear that, by affirming the Board\u2019s decision today, I do not bless the Board\u2019s discretion to take the opposite view tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven in the age of Chevron, deference is not a blind commandment. Federal agencies must enforce the law as written by Congress,\u201d the judge declares.\n\n\u201cBut under Chevron, we owe deference only to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes,\u201d Ho continues. \u201cSo when an agency invokes Chevron deference where it does not belong (because the relevant statutory text is not ambiguous), it is not deferring to Congress\u2019s exercise of legislative authority, but rather doing exactly the opposite.\u201d\n\nHe continues:\n\nThere is no ambiguity here. Charter schools that are privately opened and privately operated by privately chosen board members are unambiguously private entities, not political subdivisions. Accordingly, Congress has directed that those workplaces shall be subject to collective bargaining under the Act. Chevron affords the Board no authority to alter this determination. Under Chevron, only Congress has that power.\n\n\u201cCongress has the power to make laws, and courts have the power to interpret them,\u201d the Trump appointee adds. \u201cAnd the separation of these respective powers from one another, and from the Executive, is an essential principle of our Founding vision.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, it is the consolidation of legislative and judicial power in executive agencies that has caused Chevron to be called into question by various Justices,\u201d continues the former Justice Thomas law clerk, quotes various Supreme Court opinions.\n\nHo also quotes the Supreme Court in City of Arlington v. FCC, where Justice Scalia wrote, \u201cWhere Congress has established a clear line, the agency cannot go beyond it; and where Congress has established an ambiguous line, the agency can go no further than the ambiguity will fairly allow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThreshold questions like ambiguity under Chevron are not just perfunctory speedbumps,\u201d Ho reasons. \u201cThey are the means by which we are asked to apportion interpretive power between the judicial and executive branches, as well as legislative power between the legislative and executive branches.\u201d\n\nAs Justice Thomas opined in a concurrence in Michigan v. EPA (2015):\n\nWe most often describe Congress\u2019 supposed choice to leave matters to agency discretion as an allocation of interpretive authority. But we sometimes treat that discretion as though it were a form of legislative power.\n\nQuoting The Federalist No. 47, just like Thapar, Ho then explains:\n\nOur Founders did not separate power for its own sake, but to preserve liberty. Because the only way to preserve liberty is to constrain the exercise of power. So we separate power to limit power. By diffusing power across the three rival branches of government, we make it difficult for government to gang up on the citizen. For the Founders well understood that \u201c\u2018[t]here can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or body of magistrates,\u2019 or, \u2018if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.\u2019\u201d Accordingly, the Constitution divides power among the three branches, and requires government to run the gauntlet in order to exercise the coercive power of the sovereign. First, lawmaking is located where it is most politically accountable, as it should be\u2014in the hands of legislators elected by the people. Second, law enforcement is separated from lawmaking, to avoid mob rule\u2014in a separate branch of government under the authority of executive officials accountable to the President. Third, we subject government action to review for legality by a judiciary that is independent of the other two branches.\n\nHo concludes:\n\nIn sum, the Board consolidates power into a single entity that is both unaccountable to the people via Congressional election and immune from robust judicial review. That is not how the Constitution is supposed to work\u2014and when it comes to unambiguous laws, it is not how Chevron is supposed to work.\n\nThe fact that Thapar is the son of Indian immigrants and Ho is an immigrant from Taiwan is considered yet another mark in President Trump\u2019s favor among those who put stock in racial politics, as these two racial minorities are from ethnic groups many people expect to support liberal policies. And regardless of ethnicity, Thapar is 49 years old, and Ho is age 45, meaning that their views could impact the law for decades to come.\n\nKey parts of President Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again (MAGA) agenda turn on scaling back the reach of vast legions of unelected and politically unaccountable agencies and bureaucrats. Between Gorsuch and Kavanaugh\u2019s bringing to the Supreme Court their skepticism of deferring to the government, and judges like Thapar and Ho flooding the lower courts, the president and Senate Republicans are quickly building a judiciary that may yet impose meaningful limits on federal power.\n\nThe first case is United States v. Havis, No. 17-5772 in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\n\nThe second case is Voices for International Business and Education v. NLRB, No. 17-60364 in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n\nKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

Just months before, in January, the Houthis had seized the presidential palace in Sana\u2019a, forcing President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi to flee south to Aden.\n\nSaudi Arabia, fearing an Iran-backed Houthi takeover of neighboring Yemen, launched a military coalition effort to restore the Hadi government.

In the same year, roughly four million Americans turned 18 and joined the workforce. The four million Americans included the children of immigrants as well as the children of illegal migrants.\n\nMany of Obama\u2019s migrants went home when their work visas ended or they were deported, but the inflow added more than 5.2 million migrants to the U.S. population from 2010 to 2017, according to federal data prepared by the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThe inflow included 1.1 million Asians, 1.1 million Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, 680,000 people from the Caribean, and 480,000 people from South America.\n\nObama\u2019s inflow also included 475,000 unskilled migrants from Central America, many of whom were allowed to enter and stay via the pro-asylum rules set by Obama\u2019s pro-migration deputies.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2017, Obama also imported 680,000 people from Muslim-majority nations, even though Islamic theology urged believers to attack Americans. That huge inflow boosted the Islamic population of the United States by 31 percent, CIS reported.\n\nThe inflow includes many temporary workers. This influx keeps roughly 1.5 million white-collar, multi-year, visa-workers in U.S. jobs formerly held by American graduates.\n\nObama\u2019s migrant wave continued into 2017, although the CIS report suggests that the 2018 inflow may drop down by roughly 150,000. For example, President Donald Trump has blocked business pressure for expansion of the H-2B visa-worker program and has directed the H4 EAD visa worker program be ended.\n\nCIS used the federal data to estimate the immigrant population in the United States to 44.5 million, including roughly 12 million illegal aliens. The total does not include the U.S.-born children of immigrants in what progressives re-label as a \u201cnation of immigrants,\u201d even though 280 million Americans are not immigrants, but U.S.-born Americans.\n\nThe inflow includes 530,000 Hispanic immigrants and migrants who received home-country high-school credentials or less.\n\nObama\u2019s inflow also helped elect Donald Trump.\n\nThe 2014 border crisis was triggered by Obama\u2019s encouragement of Central American illegal migration.

Currently, only a little more than half of the state\u2019s education budget is spent inside the classroom.\n\n\u201cSecretary Kobach envisions a public school system in which teachers are paid what they\u2019re worth and student outcomes improve,\u201d Kobach campaign spokeswoman Danedri Herbert told Breitbart News.\n\nKobach\u2019s shifting of education funding in Kansas is intended to break with a 20-year trend where the number of students and teachers in public school increased by less than 20 percent, but the number of managers and administrators increased by 40 percent.\n\nIn a recent ad, Kobach also highlighted his planned initiative as governor to expand job training across the state to ensure a high-wage workforce.\n\nKobach has been in a near tie with his left-wing Democrat opponent Laura Kelly in almost every recent poll. The election for Kansas governor is November 6.", "A new poll from OH Predictive Insights and ABC15 Arizona (ABC15/OHPI) shows Republican Martha McSally steadily leading Democrat Kyrsten Sinema in the Arizona United States Senate race.\n\nMcSally currently holds a seven point lead over Sinema, 52 percent to Sinema\u2019s 45 percent. Two percent are still undecided and one percent support Green candidate Angela Green.\n\nThe poll, conducted via phone from October 22-23, also found Sinema to be unfavorable among 50 percent of voters, compared to McSally\u2019s 44 percent.\n\n\u201cWith the hottest race in the country coming to an end, McSally is solidifying her lead over Sinema,\u201d said Chief Pollster and Managing Partner Mike Noble. \u201cThe game-changer comes from Independent voters, who have swung from Sinema to McSally since our last poll. We\u2019ll know come Election Night whether they stick with McSally or swing back to Sinema.\u201d\n\nCompared to Sinema\u2019s four percent, McSally is leading with an 88 point margin of 92 percent among Republicans over 55, according to the poll of 600 likely general election voters.\n\nIndependents over 55 surveyed in the poll give Sinema a lead of 53 percent, compared to McSally\u2019s 46 percent. Younger independents are leaning towards McSally, giving her a 38-point lead of 68 percent over Sinema\u2019s 30 percent.\n\nIn Maricopa County, which contains the largest amount of voters in the state, McSally and Sinema are tied with 49 percent each. McSally currently leads in Pima County with 53 percent and in rural areas with 59 percent. Sinema trails with 46 percent in Pima County and 35 percent in rural areas.\n\n\u201cConsidering the historic amount of money spent on this contest, which has been primarily in Pima and Maricopa County, it is ironic that rural Arizonans have tipped the scale in McSally\u2019s direction,\u201d said Data Analyst Noah Rudnick.\n\nThe described poll has a margin of error of \u00b1 4%.", "President Donald Trump at Wednesday\u2019s rally in Florida called out far left media for using his trip to pay respects to Pittsburgh synagogue shooting victims to \u201csow anger and division.\u201d\n\nThe president on Tuesday visited victims, survivors, hospital staff, and the memorial to the victims of the mass shooting that occurred days ago at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. He expressed grief for families of the fallen and gratitude for law enforcement officers who were injured as they placed themselves in harm\u2019s way that day.\n\nTrump pledged to remove vile antisemitism and \u201creaffirm our unbreakable solidarity with the Jewish people.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump said his visit \u201cwas about coming together as a nation for comfort and to heal,\u201d but he was sad to see, when he turned on the news later that day, the left media used it to \u201csow anger and division.\u201d\n\nThe Florida rally crowd began shouting \u201cCNN sucks\u201d in response.\n\nTrump pointed to media reports that focused on a small group of protesters gathered far from where he and the first lady were during their visit. He said the left media did everything in their power to play up those protesters and push people apart. He called the reports fake and make-believe.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about division, this is a big part of the division right there,\u201d he said of those media reports. He called out far left media for spreading terrible lies about the Trump administration and the people \u201cwho make up our great movement\u201d from around the country. He called it the greatest movement in the history of America, \u201cThe movement is you and it\u2019s about you, not me, it\u2019s about you.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to his administration\u2019s restoration of the bond with Israel and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, something many presidents promised, but none had delivered.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken unprecedented action to confront the regime in Iran and we have ended the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear catastrophe,\u201d said Trump \u201cIran is a much different country today than the country that started off at the beginning of our administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have forcefully condemned hatred, bigotry, racism, and prejudice in all of its ugly forms, but the media doesn\u2019t want you to hear your story,\u201d said Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s why 33 percent of the people in this country believe the fake news is in fact\u2026the enemy of the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe left-wing media doesn\u2019t want to solve problems, they want to stoke resentment. It has to stop,\u201d declared Trump. \u201cThey believe that progress isn\u2019t good for profit or for whatever reason it is they\u2019re playing their game.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur movement is about safe homes, great jobs for every citizen. Our movement is about love for fellow Americans,\u201d said Trump. \u201cOur movement is for everyone and belongs to anyone who wants to build a better future. You can do it right here in the USA.\u201d He then pointed to the accomplishments under the Trump administration.\n\nMichelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News \u2014 follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook", "Democrat New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had to apologize to the loved ones of victims killed in a terror attack near New York City\u2019s Tribeca neighborhood in 2017 because he forgot to pay homage to the victims of the attack.\n\nSurvivors of the attack and relatives of those killed attended the ceremony, but Bill de Blasio failed to mention the victims by name or give any information about who they were. Instead, the mayor thanked first responders without mentioning anything about those who lost their lives.\n\nWhen the 15-minute ceremony concluded, de Blasio shook hands with the victims\u2019 families before rushing to the podium. Once at the podium, de Blasio said someone called him out on his failure to honor the victims.\n\n\u201cI apologize. This should have been part of the gathering to read the names of the eight that we lost,\u201d de Blasio told the crowd. \u201cSo I want to right that wrong with apologies and do that now and ask everyone to bow their heads as we remember each of them.\u201d\n\nThe ceremony marked one year since terrorism suspect Sayfullo Saipov allegedly mowed down several pedestrians traveling on a bike path in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. Eight people died and dozens of others were injured in the incident which law enforcement officials have called \u201can act of terror.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio has a history of snubbing family members and law enforcement in times of tragedy. In 2014, de Blasio showed up two hours late to a memorial service for slain NYPD officer Rafael Ramos.\n\nIn that same year, the Democrat mayor\u2019s tardiness also caused him to miss the moment of silence at a ceremony in Queens honoring the 267 people killed in the American Airlines Flight 587 crash in November 2001.", "An American federal court convicted a Wisconsin man of trying to provide support to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced this week.\n\n\u201cOn Oct. 5, 2016, Ludke and his coconspirator were traveling to the Texas/Mexico border in order to accomplish their plan to join ISIS (in Syria or Iraq), when law enforcement located and arrested them,\u201d DOJ revealed on Tuesday.\n\nThe Trump administration identified the defendant as 37-year-old Jason Michael Ludke of Milwaukee, noting that he \u201cpled guilty to conspiring to provide material support or resources to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS),\u201d on October 25.\n\nCiting the plea agreement, DOJ noted:\n\nLudke and a co-conspirator agreed that they would travel through Mexico to Syria and Iraq in order to join ISIS and to work under its direction and control. Ludke also recorded a video of himself pledging his allegiance to the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and stating that he was ready to join ISIS. Ludke told an FBI Undercover Employee (UCE), who Ludke believed was assisting in the travel plans, that Ludke had training in jiu-jitsu and computers, which Ludke believed would benefit ISIS. Ludke has prior convictions for child sexual assault and for making death threats against a federal judge.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, Ludke was reportedly already on probation and had cut the monitoring device from his ankle before traveling outside of Wisconsin.\n\nWLUK-TV, a local Fox-affiliated television station in Green Bay, identified Ludke\u2019s co-defendant as 30-year-old Yosvany Padilla-Conde.\n\nLudke is facing a maximum of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\n\u201cThis conviction demonstrates the United States\u2019 resolute commitment to protecting our country and combatting foreign terrorism,\u201d U.S. Attorney Matthew Krueger declared, according to DOJ. \u201cIndividuals like Ludke who seek to provide material support to ISIS will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nLudke\u2019s case is at least the second this year involving a Wisconsin native trying to lend support to ISIS.\n\nIn June, federal authorities charged Waheba Issa Dais of Cudahy, a 45-year-old mother of two, with \u201cproviding material support or resources\u201d to ISIS after she \u201chacked social media accounts, including on Facebook, to recruit on behalf of the Islamic State terrorist group and to provide instruction on such terrorism basics as making explosives and biological weapons.\u201d", "Former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama have acquired author Michael Lewis\u2019 nonfiction book The Fifth Risk \u2014 a gloomy expose about the far-reaching ramifications of a Trump presidency \u2014 to make into a Netflix series, according to reports.\n\nThe Fifth Risk, slated for release on October 2 via W.W. Norton, details the so-called \u201cchaos and mismanagement\u201d that occurred inside the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Energy during the transition period between Obama and then-president-elect Donald Trump.\n\nLewis claims the Trump transition team selected candidates for key agency positions that they were highly unqualified for, while some jobs still remain vacant. \u201cOne interview in the book is with John MacWilliams, who served as the Energy Department\u2019s first-ever chief risk officer. He conveys his worries that any shortchanging in the department under Trump could lead to a nuclear-weapons accident, a potential conflict with North Korea or Iran, or an attack on the U.S. electrical grid,\u201d according to Deadline.\n\nIn an interview with Katie Couric set for release Thursday, Lewis says his book is \u201ca civics lesson\u2026 I did three departments, because it would be the work of many lifetimes to do the whole government, but you could do this in a fun way across the entire government.\u201d\n\nPress representatives for the Obamas and Lewis declined to comment on the report.\n\nIn May, Netflix announced it would partner with the Obamas to develop original content for the video streaming giant.\n\n\u201cPresident Barack Obama and Michelle Obama have entered into a multi-year agreement to produce films and series for the streaming platform, potentially including scripted series, unscripted series, docu-series, documentaries, and features,\u201d a statement from Netflix read.\n\nThe former president told attendees of a Las Vegas technology conference that he intends to use the development deal to help \u201ctrain the next generation of leaders.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to tell stories.

He blamed bad weather for causing the crash. The Taliban said its fighters shot down the Afghan National Army (ANA) helicopter, though it was not possible to independently verify the insurgent claims.\n\nBoth western Afghanistan provinces of Farah and Herat sit along the Iranian border.\n\nOn October 23, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against \u201cTaliban facilitators and the Iranian supporters.\u201d\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declared:\n\nThe [multi-national] TFTC [Terrorist Financing Targeting Center] has again demonstrated its tremendous value to international security by disrupting and exposing key Taliban members who are involved in suicide attacks, and other lethal activities. We are also targeting key Iranian sponsors providing financial and material support to the Taliban. Iran\u2019s provision of military training, financing, and weapons to the Taliban is yet another example of Tehran\u2019s blatant regional meddling and support for terrorism. The United States and our partners will not tolerate the Iranian regime exploiting Afghanistan to further their destabilizing behavior. Iran\u2019s support to the Taliban stands in stark violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions and epitomizes the regime\u2019s utter disregard for fundamental international norms.\n\nSeparately on Wednesday, Afghan authorities determined that an Islamic State (ISIS)-claimed suicide blast at the country\u2019s largest prison in Kabul killed at least six people and wounded scores of others, bringing the total number of Afghan fatalities that day to 31.\n\nKabul police spokesman Basir Mujahid indicated that police officers and civilians were among the victims."]
