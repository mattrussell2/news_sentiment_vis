["The First Step Act \u2014 dubbed \u201cprison release\u201d by conservatives and law enforcement officials \u2014 will reduce sentences for drug traffickers while immediately resulting in the release of 4,000 inmates.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Trump announced that he would sign the First Step Act legislation against the wishes of conservatives and the law enforcement community. The legislation has been a priority for Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, as well as the GOP megadonor billionaire Koch brothers.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, the prison reform plan will cut the penalty for drug traffickers in at least half. Current law mandates a prison sentence of at least 20 years for a repeat fentanyl drug trafficker. The First Step Act automatically reduces that sentence by five years and further cuts the penalty through a number of changes which result in a seven year, ten month prison time. This is less than half of the time that the drug trafficker would have served under current law.\n\nThis sentencing reduction could apply to a repeat drug trafficker who trafficked more than 400 grams of fentanyl into the U.S., enough to kill 100,000 Americans.\n\nThe First Step Act also will result in the immediate release of 4,000 felons from prisons, including convicted criminals with violent crime records and affiliations with gangs.\n\nFor heroin and fentanyl traffickers, the prison reform legislation allows them to earn early release from prison so long as they earn credits for participating in \u201cproductive activities.\u201d This portion of the legislation allows for drug traffickers to get an early prison release by joining recreational leagues.\n\nExecutives working for the billionaire GOP mega-donors, the Koch brothers \u2014 many of which have close ties to Vice President Mike Pence and former Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short \u2014 held meetings at the White House with Trump officials in May and were reportedly successful in convincing the president to back the plan, despite his \u201cLaw and Order\u201d agenda.", "Television lawyer Michael Avenatti was arrested Wednesday following an alleged domestic violence dispute, law enforcement confirmed Wednesday evening.\n\nWe can confirm that today LAPD Detectives arrested Michael Avenatti on suspicion of domestic violence. This is an ongoing investigation and we will provide more details as they become available. \u2014 LAPD HQ (@LAPDHQ) November 15, 2018\n\nTMZ says of the woman involved in the alleged incident, \u201cWe\u2019re told her face was \u2018swollen and bruised.\u2019 Our sources say the alleged incident occurred Tuesday, but there was a confrontation Wednesday between the two at an exclusive apartment building in the Century City area of L.A.\u201d\n\nUpdate: Lisa Storie-Avenatti\u2019s attorney issued a statement denying Michael Avenatti\u2019s estranged wife made the allegation, calling TMZ\u2019s report inaccurate. \u201cMy client and I have reviewed the TMZ article alleging that my client, Lisa Storie-Avenatti, has been injured and that Michael Avenatti has been arrested as a result of some incident that occurred between them. This article is not true as it pertains to my client,\u201d the lawyer told BuzzFeed News. \u201cMs. Storie-Avenatti was not subject to any such incident on Tuesday night. Further, she was not at Mr. Avenatti\u2019s apartment on the date that this alleged incident occurred. My client states that there has never been domestic violence in her relationship with Michael and that she has never known Michael to be physically violent toward anyone.\u201d\n\nThe woman involved in the alleged physical altercation reportedly scrambled from the apartment where the incident occurred and was spotted on the sidewalk holding her hands over her eyes while shouting into her cell phone. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did this to me,\u201d she said, according to TMZ.\n\nFive minutes later, TMZ continues, Avenatti arrived at the apartment complex and yelled repeatedly, \u201cShe hit me first,\u201d then, \u201cThis is bullshit, this is fucking bullshit.\u201d The alleged melee occurred after the woman attempted to pick up her belongings and called 911 after tempers ran hot.\n\nLos Angeles authorities confirmed Avenatti is currently in police custody.\n\nAvenatti rose to national prominence as the legal representative of Daniels, who has alleged she had intercourse with President Donald Trump years before entering the Oval Office.\n\nAvenatti is one of a handful of potential 2020 Democrat hopefuls crisscrossing the county in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election and was active during the midterm election. To some Democrats, he represents the nonpolitician appeal that in part led President Trump to victory over more experienced politicians in 2016. Others see someone whose brash confidence could be the ultimate weapon against the president in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe people who were there appreciated him pushing back on Donald Trump,\u201d said Jaime Harrison, a former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman who visited with Avenatti during a trip to Florence. \u201cI give Avenatti an A-plus in terms of appeal because there\u2019s a section of the Democratic Party that\u2019s going to want that.\u201d\n\nWhile Avenatti is attempting to burnish his credentials as a potential 2020 heavyweight, the attorney is facing mounting legal entanglements, including a possible criminal investigation by the Justice Department. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has asked for a criminal investigation into whether Julie Swetnick and Avenatti conspired to provide false statements to Congress and obstructed a congressional investigation during the confirmation process for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nGrassley wrote in a letter to the Justice Department that Swetnick and Avenatti made serious allegations that required significant resources to investigate. However, Grassley says information from media interviews and elsewhere indicates their statements \u201clikely contained materially false claims.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t take lightly making a referral of this nature, but ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future,\u201d Grassley said in a statement.\n\nAvenatti released a sworn statement in which Swetnick said she witnessed Kavanaugh \u201cconsistently engage in excessive drinking and inappropriate contact of a sexual nature with women in the early 1980s.\u201d Kavanaugh denied the allegations and an FBI background check cleared him of any wrongdoing.\n\nFurther, Avenatti was ordered last month to pay $4.85 million to an attorney who worked at his former law firm, a California judge ruled. The Los Angeles judge ordered the payout the same day a separate ruling came down evicting Eagan Avenatti LLC from its office space in Southern California after four months of unpaid rent.\n\nIn the case over back pay, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Dennis Landin ruled that Avenatti personally guaranteed a settlement with attorney Jason Frank, who said Eagan Avenatti misstated its profits and that he was owed millions of dollars.\n\nUpdate #2: TMZ reports the LAPD obtained an \u201cemergency protective order,\u201d which prohibits Avenatti from being in the vicinity of the alleged victim. The television lawyer will be released on $50,000 bail, says the outlet.\n\nUpdate #3: Avenatti denied the allegations in a statement to BuzzFeed News, saying: \u201cI wish to thank the hard working men and woman of the LAPD for their professionalism they were only doing their jobs in light of the completely bogus allegations against me. I have never been physically abusive in my life nor was I last night. Any accusations to the contrary are fabricated and meant to do harm to my reputation. I look forward to being fully exonerated.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "A Montana woman is accused of raping and sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl on two separate occasions.\n\nAuthorities charged Reene Marie Mills, 38, of Helena, with one felony count of sexual intercourse without consent and one felony account of sexual assault after the 12-year-old disclosed to counselors and a forensic investigator that she had allegedly been attacked, the Helena Independent Record reported.\n\nThe 12-year-old girl spoke to investigators beginning in October, alleging that Mills sexually assaulted her two times\u2014once at a store in the Helena area and another time at a private residence, according to documents containing the charges.\n\nMills made her first appearance in Lewis and Clark Justice court via video on Tuesday, where a judge set her bond at $50,000 and ordered her not to have contact with her victim, KXLH reported.\n\nThe Montana woman also faced a sexual assault charge in 2016, although it is unclear whether she was convicted of the charge.\n\nMills remains in custody as of Wednesday, according to online jail records.", "Wednesday on the Senate floor, Judiciary Committee member Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) said he will oppose advancing any of President Donald Trump\u2019s judicial nominations out of committee until legislation protecting Department of Justice special counsel Robert Mueller got a full Senate vote.\n\nFlake expressed concerned for Mueller\u2019s Russian investigation after the appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting Attorney General.\n\nAfter Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) blocked a full vote, Flake said, \u201cOne further note on this unanimous consent that has just failed today. Senator Coons and I are prepared to make it again and again until there is a vote on this vital bipartisan legislation on the Senate floor.

A smaller caravan reportedly passed through Tuesday night with an additional 400 in transit.\n\nThe 22-bus caravan is expected to continue north on Mexican Federal Highway 15\u2013temporarily stopping or passing through Hermosillo and north through Santa Ana, then west onto Mexican Federal Highway 2 past Caborca, San Luis Rio Colorado, Mexicali, Tecate and then to Tijuana.\n\nThis segment of the migrant caravan is part of the 7,000 to 10,000 Central Americans who crossed into Mexico approximately one month ago. Roughly 6,531 migrants crossed the state of Queretaro over the weekend, according to the local government. The figure is greater than the count made by authorities when the group spent several days in Mexico City, which suggests the possibility that other migrants joined the caravan. The group eventually stopped in Guadalajara after passing through Guanajuato. Authorities provided federal police escorts since they are traveling through some of the most dangerous territories of Mexico. Guanajuato experienced a 400% increase in murders since 2015 as organized crime gangs fight over lucrative drug trafficking routes and illegal fuel pipeline taps.\n\nBreitbart News reported extensively on the cartel violence in Tijuana, with a total of 2,152 homicides in 2018. Some in the caravan are aiming for the California-Mexico border area to avoid Tamaulipas and Coahuila . There, cartels tend to direct their violence against the migrant community via extortion schemes.", "Payment processing service PayPal has blacklisted free speech YouTube alternative \u201cBitChute,\u201d stopping the platform from receiving or sending any money through its service, which BitChute used as its main payment processor. BitChute blames the action on its \u201cstand against the current trend in censorship.\u201d\n\nBitChute announced the blacklisting in a blog post, Wednesday, declaring, \u201cA few hours ago BitChute received a notice that our PayPal account has been permanently limited, with immediate effect, and that we will no longer be able to accept or send payments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe notice included the following information: \u2018The User Agreement for PayPal Service states that PayPal, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to limit an account for any violation of the User Agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy.\u2019 This decision seems to be final although we will try to appeal,\u201d BitChute founder and CEO Ray Vahey explained. \u201cBitChute has had a Paypal account since 2016, we have used it to settle payments and to receive subscription payments from supporters along with other discretionary payments. It\u2019s our belief that it is our stand against the current trend in censorship that has resulted in this action.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitChute is politically neutral and we have a diverse community in interests and backgrounds. We require that users only upload legal content that complies with our terms and community guidelines. We carry out moderation to remove all content that breaches our terms and community guidelines, including but not limited to videos from terrorists, child abuse or pirated video,\u201d continued Vahey, adding, \u201cBitChute is pro-free expression which is a universal human right.\u201d\n\nVahey concluded that BitChute is currently \u201cworking to get a replacement credit card payments processor.\u201d\n\nBitChute has previously called out payments processor Stripe for blacklisting Gab, another alternative social network, and in an April interview with Breitbart Tech, BitChute declared, \u201cWhat we need is more competition, more alternatives, more freedom.\u201d\n\nIn October, alternative social network Gab was blacklisted by PayPal and Stripe, while in August, conservative writer David Horowitz was blacklisted by Visa and Mastercard.\n\nInfowars, Tommy Robinson, Robert Spencer, Pamela Geller, WikiLeaks, and 2018 Toronto mayoral election candidate Faith Goldy are also currently, or have previously been, blacklisted by PayPal.\n\n\u201cThe creeping exclusion of the right from online platforms like Twitter and Facebook is well-known, drawing the attention of Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale and the RNC. But a greater challenge is on the horizon: the exclusion of the right from financial services,\u201d proclaimed Breitbart Tech Senior Reporter Allum Bokhari in July. \u201cConservatives have long been the target of shadowbans, biased algorithms, and account bans on social media. Not content with silencing their voices online, the left now wants to stop the right from using the web to fundraise. Thanks to the increasing willingness of online fundraising platforms and payment processors to ban clients for political reasons, they are getting their way.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the left prepares for the 2018 midterms and the 2020 general election, they want to ensure that only they have access to that tremendous power. And with PayPal and Stripe withdrawing support from politically neutral fundraising platforms, they are well on their way to achieving that aim,\u201d he continued. \u201cLike the social media purges, this represents an existential threat to the conservative and pro-Trump movement.\u201d\n\nIn the same month, liberal nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation claimed to be \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that payment processors were becoming the \u201cde facto internet censors.\u201d", "Election recounts would be more plausible if Democrats occasionally let the Republican win. But they don\u2019t. Ballots miraculously discovered days and weeks after the election \u2014 in the back seat of a car, after helpful \u201ccorrections\u201d to the ballots by election supervisors, etc. \u2014 invariably result in a surprise win for the Democrat.\n\nVoters are just supposed to accept that, unless Republicans win an election by an insuperable margin, the Democrats will steal it.\n\nAnd the thieving is cheered on by our media. Whenever President Trump has the effrontery to mention that GOP victories are being stolen by corrupt Democratic officials, the media snippily note that his claim is \u201cUNSUBSTANTIATED.\u201d\n\nThus, for example, in the first 60 seconds of CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d on Monday, Burnett said:\n\n\u2014 \u201c(The email from Trump headquarters) without providing any evidence \u2026 warns that, quote, corrupt Democrats are trying to, quote, steal election victories in Florida. \u2026\n\n\u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s a baseless claim that President Trump has been pushing for days. \u2026\n\n\u2014 \u201c(Gov. Rick) Scott (is) talking about rampant fraud without providing any evidence. \u2026\n\n\u2014 \u201cNow, \u2018steal an election,\u2019 \u2018committing fraud\u2019 are big claims to make without having evidence.\u201d\n\nHey! I have an idea! Why doesn\u2019t CNN rustle up some reporters to go and investigate the biggest story of the year?\n\nNo, the burden is on random Republicans \u2014 who have jobs other than \u201creporting the news\u201d \u2014 to produce bulletproof evidence of voter fraud. Otherwise, it\u2019s just a wacky coincidence that these \u201crecounts\u201d always result in mysterious new votes for Democrats.\n\nIf a freelance investigative reporter like James O\u2019Keefe actually does produce the evidence that our media are too lazy and biased to get for themselves, they sneer that O\u2019Keefe can\u2019t be trusted. He\u2019s not a real reporter!\n\nWhat a real reporter does is call up some left-wing outfit, get a quote, and peremptorily announce that there has never been an illegal ballot cast in any election, ever.\n\nWe called the Brennan Center for Justice, and they assured us that voter fraud doesn\u2019t exist. I can prove I called \u2014 I\u2019ll show you my phone records! We\u2019re not going to send our reporters on a snipe hunt. Oh, and we also got an interesting brochure on voter suppression, such as the Nazi-inspired idea that voters should know how to spell their own names.\n\nThat\u2019s what we get from our crackerjack media. Journalists\u2019 phones should be taken away, so they\u2019d be forced to do actual reporting.\n\nRepublicans control the state legislature and governor\u2019s office in Florida. They control the U.S. Congress and the presidency. If that\u2019s not enough to prevent two statewide Florida elections from being stolen, the GOP is more useless than I\u2019d already imagined.\n\nHere\u2019s a primer for Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan on how to deal with all the Senate and House election \u201crecounts\u201d that keep magically flipping seats to the Democrats.\n\nIn 1974, Republican Louis Wyman won his race for U.S. Senate in New Hampshire, beating Democrat John Durkin by 355 votes. Durkin demanded a recount \u2014 which went back and forth by a handful of votes until the state\u2019s Ballot Law Commission concluded that Wyman had indeed won.\n\nWyman was certified the winner by the New Hampshire secretary of state and was on his way to Washington, D.C., when \u2026 the Senate refused to seat him. New Hampshire\u2019s certification of Wyman as the winner meant nothing, because, you see, Democrats held a majority in the Senate.\n\nThe Senate spent months examining disputed ballots. Unable to come up with any method whereby they could declare the Democrat the winner, the Senate forced New Hampshire to hold another election.\n\nDemoralized Republicans stayed home and, this time, the Democrat won.\n\nHey, Mitch! Don\u2019t Republicans hold a majority in the Senate?\n\nIn 1984, Democrat Frank McCloskey won a razor-thin re-election to the House from Indiana\u2019s 8th Congressional District. The state held two recounts, both of which the Republican won. The Washington Post reported that there were \u201cno allegations of fraud\u201d in the recount, and 90 percent of ballot disqualifications had been agreed to \u201cby election commissions dominated by Democrats.\u201d\n\nConsequently, Indiana\u2019s secretary of state certified Republican Rick McIntyre the winner.\n\nBut the Democratic-controlled House simply refused to seat McIntyre. Instead, the House undertook its own \u201crecount.\u201d You\u2019ll never guess who won!\n\nDon\u2019t Republicans have a majority in the House for six more weeks?\n\nIn 2008, Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota won his re-election bid against challenger Al Franken by 725 votes. But for several weeks after the election, Democratic precincts kept discovering new votes for Franken \u2014 including ballots sitting in cars, as well as a write-in vote for \u201cFrankenstein\u201d \u2014 which was counted as a vote for Franken. (Duh.)\n\nThese late-discovered ballots eventually put Frankenstein ahead by 312 votes, whereupon he was immediately certified the winner by the George Soros-backed secretary of state.\n\nThe U.S. Senate was in Democratic hands, so there was no question but that Majority Leader Harry Reid would seat the cheater, Franken. And that, kids, is how the Democrats got the 60th vote for Obamacare.\n\nFour years later, we found out that more than 1,000 felons \u2014 ineligible to vote \u2014 had cast ballots in the 2008 Minnesota election. (To state the obvious, felons support Democrats by about 10-1.)\n\nIn the middle of the Democrats\u2019 open theft of the Indiana seat in 1984, The New York Times pompously reminded readers of the \u201cbasic constitutional principle that Congress is the judge of its own membership and that lawmakers can overrule state laws in making that determination.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve already caved on Arizona, Mitch. How about taking a page from the Democrats\u2019 playbook? You don\u2019t have to go full Daley Machine. Democrats steal elections they actually lost. Republicans just want you to hang on to the seats they won.", "Tijuana officials reportedly said 369 caravan migrants arrived in their border city on Wednesday, in addition to the nearly 400 on Tuesday.\n\nJean Guerrero, an investigative reporter for KPBS, tweeted that Tijuana officials claimed an additional 369 migrant caravan members arrived on November 14.

That was a busy year for coalition forces with Operation Moshtarak the largest offensive operation of the war up to that point,\u201d Statista reported, citing U.S. Air Force Central Command data.\n\nAccording to Pentagon figures, 2010 was the deadliest year (497 deaths) for U.S. military troops in Afghanistan.\n\nStatista attributed the historic increase in bombs dropped in Afghanistan this year primarily \u201cto a change in the rules of engagement which allows coalition forces to open fire on the enemy without having to be in close contact with them. The change was orchestrated by Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis who wanted to remove such restrictions in order to use air power to its full potential and defeat the enemy.\u201d\n\nAfter former U.S. President Barack Obama declared that American troops had ceased their combat mission in Afghanistan at the end of 2014, the U.S. military was only authorized to shoot at the Taliban after they attacked, from a defensive position, the top commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan at the time told lawmakers.\n\nWhile the number of bombs dropped by the U.S. military has increased dramatically under Trump, the number of fatalities incurred by American service members has fallen significantly.\n\nThe vast majority of the U.S. military deaths and injuries took place under Obama\u2019s watch.\n\nSince Trump became president, the U.S. military has dropped about 9,574 bombs, including 4,361 bombs in 2017 and 5,213 so far this year.\n\n\u201cThe change [in rules of engagement], combined with more air strikes by the Afghan Air Force, has also led to a spike in civilian deaths,\u201d Statista noted.\n\nIn October, the United Nations reported that the Taliban and to a lesser extent ISIS are responsible for the majority of civilian deaths and injuries.\n\nLast August, President Trump announced a new Afghan strategy that involved boosting the number of American troops in the country to 14,000 after his predecessor pulled out nearly all the U.S. forces.\n\nThe Trump administration has made \u201creconciliation\u201d between Kabul and the Afghan Taliban the primary goal of its strategy. In recent months, the U.S. has intensified efforts to pressure the Taliban to negotiate an end to the war, which is more than 17 years old.", "Wednesday at the National Action Network Legislative & Policy Conference, House Leader Rep.

The missile struck while the bus was moving slowly towards a parking lot. One soldier, who was standing next to the bus, was critically wounded in the blast.\n\nImmediately after the missile strike against the bus, Hamas and its partner, Islamic Jihad, initiated the largest bombardment of Israel they had ever undertaken from Gaza. By late Tuesday morning, the two terror groups had fired more than 400 projectiles into Israel. Fifty Israelis were wounded in the onslaught. One person was killed when a mortar hit an apartment building in Ashkelon. Hundreds of mortars and rockets and missiles were intercepted by Israel\u2019s Iron Dome anti-missile batteries. And the government announced it was rushing more Iron Dome batteries to the area.\n\nIn the hours following the joint Hamas-Islamic Jihad assault, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman (who stepped down Wednesday) ordered the Israel Air Force (IAF) to carry out a large-scale air assault against Hamas command posts and other facilities in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn a media briefing, a senior Air Force commander said the IAF strikes since Monday night have been the most far-reaching raids Israel has ever conducted in Gaza. More than a hundred targets were hit in under two hours, he said.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Security Cabinet, which is authorized to order the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to open large-scale operations, including war, convened on Tuesday morning. Its final decision was to walk back the conflict and agree to a ceasefire, with no terms.\n\nThe cabinet\u2019s decision was met with fury by residents of the south. They came out in droves, blocked a major highway leading to the embattled border town of Sderot, and set fire to tires while attacking the government for opting not to go to war against Hamas.\n\nDefense Minister Liberman held a press conference Wednesday afternoon announcing his resignation in protest against the decision to walk away from the conflict.\n\nNetanyahu, for his part, defended the government\u2019s decision in a speech on Wednesday morning. With Liberman\u2019s resignation imminent, Netanyahu said that he was acting on information about Israel\u2019s enemies that he cannot share with the public. And he insisted that Israel would take action to defeat them at a time and in a manner of its choosing.\n\nWhat might he have been talking about?\n\nIn all likelihood, he was talking about Iran.\n\nTo understand the role Iran is playing in Gaza, it is important to take a close look at the missile strike against the bus on Monday.\n\nHamas terrorists in Gaza filmed the blast. According to Israel\u2019s Hadashot news network\u2019s veteran Arab affairs commentator, Ehud Ya\u2019ari, the footage of the blast was first broadcast on Iranian television in Lebanon and only later rebroadcast on Palestinian television.\n\nThis is highly significant. The initial Iranian broadcast indicates that Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not independent actors in their aggression against Israel. Rather, they are Iranian proxies. They receive their orders from Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps and Iran\u2019s Lebanese army, Hezbollah. And they report to their Iranian and Lebanese commanders.\n\nWhen Hamas and Islamic Jihad go to war against Israel from Gaza, they do so not merely because they have become convinced that Israel will go to great lengths to avoid a major military operation against Gaza that would require the IDF to deploy large numbers of military forces and assets to Gaza. (Although surely their awareness of Israel\u2019s deep-seated desire to avoid another major war with Hamas-Islamic Jihad in Gaza empowers them to attack.)\n\nAnd they shower Israel with missiles, rockets, and mortars merely because by agreeing to enable Qatar to transfer cash and fuel to Gaza to keep the Hamas regime afloat to secure a ceasefire, Israel showed Hamas that it can be extorted. (Although the knowledge that Israel is willing to be extorted to avoid war certainly also played into the Hamas-Islamic Jihad\u2019s decision to attack Israel.)\n\nThe main reason Hamas and Islamic Jihad attacked Israel is because Iran told them to do so.\n\nSo when Israel decides not to take the bait but rather accepts a humiliating and \u2013 in an election year \u2013 politically costly ceasefire, we have to think about the relative balance of power today between Israel and Iran.\n\nOutside of Lebanon, which Iran effectively controls through Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s chief area of operations in Israel\u2019s neighborhood is Syria, where Iran has been going from strength to strength. With each passing day, the Russian- and Iranian-Hezbollah-controlled regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad reasserts and reinforces its control over much of Syrian territory. As it does so, the threat of a major war that will pit Israel against Hezbollah forces in Lebanon, and against Hezbollah, Iranian, and Syrian forces operating under Russian protection in Syria, rises.\n\nGaza plays a role here, as it has in the past, because if Israel is sucked into deploying large numbers of forces to Gaza to fight Hamas, it will leave its Northern Front vulnerable. That is precisely what happened in the summer of 2006.\n\nOne of the most forgotten aspects of Israel\u2019s 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon is that it began in Gaza. Two weeks before Hezbollah opened hostilities against Israel by attacking a military patrol along the border, killing eight IDF reserve soldiers and stealing the bodies of two of the dead, Hamas carried out a similar operation in southern Israel.\n\nOn June 25, 2006, a combined force of terrorists from Hamas and the Palestine Liberation Organization\u2019s (PLO) Fatah faction entered Israel from Gaza through an underground tunnel. They reached an IDF position along the border and attacked a sleeping tank crew. Two soldiers were killed, and three were wounded. One of the wounded, Cpl. Gilad Shalit, was captured and taken to Gaza.\n\nFollowing the cross-border attack, Hamas and its terrorist allies carried out a large-scale bombardment of Israel with mortar and rocket fire.\n\nIsrael deployed a large number of ground and air forces to Gaza. So when Hezbollah attacked two-and-a-half weeks later, Israel was far more vulnerable than it would otherwise have been.\n\nThere are two main reasons that the prospect of war between Israel and Iran-Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria has grown. First, Iran is interested in fighting before U.S. sanctions drive it into bankruptcy. And second, Russia\u2019s recent turn towards Iran and Hezbollah and away from Israel has emboldened Tehran.\n\nUntil September 17, Russian President Vladimir Putin was sitting on the fence, with everything concerning Russian relations with Israel on the one hand, and Russian relations with Iran-Hezbollah on the other hand. Until September 17, Putin was interested in preventing an Iranian war against Israel even as he enabled Iran to assert control over Syrian through Hezbollah and the Assad regime. To thatw end, while fighting with Iran to secure Assad\u2019s continued hold on power, he agreed to a coordination mechanism with Israel that enabled Israel to attack Iranian targets in Syria that directly threatened Israel. According to the Israeli government, in the 12 months preceding September 17, Israel carried out more than 200 airstrikes \u2013 or more than 4 strikes a week \u2013 against Iranian targets in Syria.\n\nOn September 17, Russia abruptly changed its posture. That day, Syrian forces manning an S-200 surface to air missile battery in Damascus accidentally downed a Russian spy plane.\n\nRather than blame the incompetent Syrian forces that indiscriminately shot off missiles that downed their plane, the Russians blamed Israel, which had completed a strike in Syria 15 minutes before the Russian jet was downed.\n\nRussia\u2019s seemingly irrational assault on Israel, blaming it for an action undertaken by Syria, was a calculated move. By attacking Israel, Russia was able to use the episode as a means to end its tactical cooperation with Israel in Syria and swing entirely to Iran\u2019s side.\n\nRussia moved rapidly to complete its pivot to Iran.\n\nRight after the Syrians shot down the Russian plane, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that it was deploying the more advanced S-300 surface to air missile system in Damascus. Barely a week later, the S-300 landed at Russia\u2019s Khmeimim air base in Syria and was quickly assembled and deployed.\n\nAccording to media reports, Israel has severely constrained its air activities in Syria since Russia delivered the S-300 battery. In the meantime, Iran has continued and stepped up its missile shipments to Hezbollah through the Damascus airport.\n\nLast week, Israel carried out a major air exercise with the Greek air force. According to Israeli media reports, the purpose of the exercise was to train pilots to operate in the presence of an S-300 battery. Greece fields an S-300 system.\n\nSince September 17, Netanyahu has tried on multiple occasions to meet with Putin, only to be rebuffed. Netanyahu met with Putin briefly in Paris over the weekend. The Israeli media reported that their brief exchange provoked Netanyahu to brief his cabinet that \u201cthe crisis with Putin is far worse than we thought.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump was scheduled to meet with Putin in Paris. But shortly before Trump left for Paris, the meeting was postponed until November 30.\n\nGiven the inflamed situation in the north, Russia\u2019s betrayal and Iran\u2019s clear interest in provoking a two-front war, Netanyahu\u2019s rationale for accepting the politically damaging and humiliating ceasefire with Hamas becomes clear. The main reason that Israel has gone to such great lengths to avoid a major conflict with Hamas is because it is mainly concerned with Hezbollah and Iran in the north. The IDF and the government have no interest in deploying thousands of troops to Gaza, where they will be unavailable to fight in the north when they are needed.\n\nPresumably, Netanyahu is hoping that Trump will succeed where he has apparently failed in weakening Russia\u2019s sudden determination to stand with Iran against Israel. Presumably he is hoping to delay major action against Hamas-Hezbollah-Iran until circumstances are less propitious for Iran both economically and militarily.\n\nBut as the missile attack on the bus, and Hamas\u2019s unprecedented, ferocious rocket assault on southern Israel showed, the longer Israel waits to strike its enemies, the more powerful they become. So the longer Israel delays action, the more difficult it will be for it to defeat its enemies in a strategically significant way.\n\nAnd as Lieberman\u2019s resignation and the protests against the government from the beleaguered and infuriated residents of southern Israel demonstrate, the political price of delaying the inevitable may become prohibitive for Netanyahu and his political partners in his coalition government.\n\nCaroline Glick is a world-renowned journalist and commentator on the Middle East and U.S. foreign policy, and the author of The Israeli Solution: A One-State Plan for Peace in the Middle East.

But that wasn\u2019t before the tech giant sadistically made virtually every other metropolitan area beg for its patronage.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Amazon chose to locate its new headquarters in NYC and DC, the twin hubs of finance, media, and political power in America. But before the company made its eminently predictable decision, other cities still felt compelled to kiss Jeff Bezos\u2019 ring, in the vain hope of attracting the same tech giant whose rise has gutted their local main streets.\n\nSome of the behavior by city governments was pretty humiliating. Kansas City mayor Sly James personally bought and reviewed 1,000 Amazon products (all 5-star reviews, of course), in an effort to persuade the company to set up shop in his city. And in Georgia, the town of Stonecrest offered to rename itself \u201cAmazon, Georgia\u201d if the tech giant picked them.\n\nBeyond these obsequious examples, cities offered eye-watering financial incentives to Amazon. These include an offer of $8.5 billion in tax incentives and infrastructure aid from Montgomery County, Maryland, a $7 billion offer from Newark, New Jersey, and a $2 billion bid from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In all cases, the cities approved local ordinances that provide for the tax breaks before Amazon made its decision. It goes without saying that no small or medium-sized business gets offered billions of dollars to set up shop.\n\nNYC and D.C didn\u2019t get Amazon\u2019s patronage for free, by the way \u2014 both areas enticed the tech giant with $2.5 billion in subsidies.\n\nThis would be less embarrassing if it weren\u2019t for the damage that the company has wrought in the retail sector, an industry which many small cities and towns have relied on as blue-collar industries have disappeared. Everyone from top venture capitalists to President Trump agrees that the tech giant\u2019s rise has been poison for local brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nThe numbers don\u2019t lie: the tech giant\u2019s value has skyrocketed in recent years \u2014 rising 37 percent in 2017 alone, it is now the world\u2019s second most valuable company. During the same short period, the fortunes of America\u2019s retail sector have gone from bad to worse, with clothing stores, automotive retailers, and general merchandise stores all seeing massive declines in value. Some of this can surely be attributed to factors other than Amazon, but the online retailer bears an outsized portion of the responsibility.\n\nWorse, Amazon is not replacing lost retail jobs with new ones. \u201cAmazon is going to kill more American jobs than China did,\u201d is the grim analysis of MarketWatch columnist Rex Nutting. The problem is that Amazon requires far fewer human jobs than the local retail sector does (and it\u2019s likely to require even fewer as drone transportation comes into play over the next few years). Despite its spectacular growth, the number of workers employed by Amazon is less than a quarter of Walmart\u2019s, America\u2019s largest retailer.\n\nCombine the employees of other businesses that Amazon threatens, and the amount of potentially displaced jobs is even higher. Per MarketWatch:\n\nIf Amazon can capture 40% of the GAFO market within five years (as seems likely), about 1.5 million jobs at brick-and-mortar stores could be lost. Add in the jobs Amazon will kill at grocery stores, drugstores, warehouses and delivery services, and the total would be well over 2 million.\n\nAdd in the notoriously low tax rate that Amazon pays to local and national government and the fawning behavior of America\u2019s cities goes from embarrassing to cravenly selfish: 50,000 jobs for one or two cities, and an economic desert for everyone else. Perhaps it\u2019s fitting that the prize went to D.C. and NYC, two cities already entrenched as perpetual winners in America\u2019s geographical wealth disparities.\n\nAllum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

Twenty-five asylum seekers were allowed on Monday and 60 more on Tuesday.\n\nAt El Chaparral port of entry in Tijuana, Mexican immigration officials say 90 people will be allowed to make asylum claims today.

Allen Jr. that the pope\u2019s negative ratings had tripled, which is directly related to the way he has dealt with the sexual abuse crisis in the Church.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported last month, the pope\u2019s approval rating among U.S. Catholics has plunged to an all-time low in the face of his refusal to answer allegations that he rehabilitated serial homosexual abuser Cardinal Theodore McCarrick.\n\nOnly 30 percent of Catholic adults say Francis is doing an \u201cexcellent\u201d or a \u201cgood\u201d job addressing the sex abuse crisis, the Pew Research Center found in its most recent survey on the issue, a decline of 24 points since 2015 and 14 points from when Pew last asked the question this past January.\n\nSimilarly, a CNN poll in September showed the pope\u2019s approval rating among U.S citizens falling to an all-time low, dropping below 50 percent for the first time since his election in 2013.\n\nThis week, the pope forbade the U.S. bishops from voting on new measures to address clerical sex abuse, a move that can only bring his approval ratings lower still. Even the bishops themselves expressed consternation over the surprising Vatican intervention.\n\nAccording to the papal ambassador to the United States, Archbishop Christophe Pierre, the reason for the last-minute suspension of the vote was Francis\u2019s concern for \u201ccommunion,\u201d meaning he wants the whole Church to move together rather than having national bishops\u2019 conferences make their own policies \u2014 a justification that many observers find untenable.\n\nThe pope has convoked the presidents of the national Catholic bishops\u2019 conferences to meet with him in Rome next February to discuss what can be done worldwide to address the issue.\n\nMore and more people, however, are seeing Pope Francis as part of the problem rather than part of the solution when it comes to clerical sex abuse.\n\nNot only has Francis refused to answer allegations against him personally; he has also denied requests by the U.S. bishops to open a formal Vatican investigation into the McCarrick case. In September, the president of the U.S. Bishops Conference (USCCB), Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, traveled to Rome to urge Francis to launch the investigation but returned to the U.S. empty-handed.\n\n\u201cBack in 2014, 54 percent of American Catholics thought he was doing a good or excellent job,\u201d Mr. Cooperman said Monday. \u201cToday it\u2019s down to just 3 in 10, 30 percent of U.S. Catholics giving him a good or excellent, dropping 24 points in four years, 14 points just from the beginning of 2018.\u201d\n\nIn comparison to previous popes, Francis is not seen particularly well, Cooperman said.\n\n\u201cFor a while, he had a far higher favorability than Benedict, but I think that now he\u2019s dropped down to Benedict\u2019s level and even below it,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

The meeting was called in response to the Prime Minister having reached a basic deal with the European Union on Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union.\n\nThe details of the deal were leaked to the Irish press before the Cabinet had even been able to see them, leading to accusations that the European Union was treating the Prime Minister with \u201ccontempt\u201d. Key Brexiteers were incredibly scathing about the reported details of the deal, including Brexit leader and former UKIP boss Nigel Farage, who told Breitbart News Daily on Wednesday morning that he was \u201cabsolutely incensed\u201d and that it was \u201cthe worst deal in history\u201d.\n\nTory Brexiteer Rees-Mogg said of the Prime Minister\u2019s plan on Tuesday evening: \u201c\u2026she hasn\u2019t so much struck a deal as surrendered to Brussels, and given in to them on everything that they want, and tried to frustrate Brexit.

The procedure will see Mr Brady first telephone those who have already sent letters to see whether they still wish to proceed, which may see the number dwindle below the threshold.\n\nIt is also rumoured that the Prime Minister has allies who have sent Brady letters with the intention of withdrawing them if the number is reached, scuppering a coup as it starts and giving the Prime Minister advance warning of a move against her.\n\nEven if it goes to a vote, it is perfectly possible that Theresa May could muster the votes to survive the contest \u2014 many Tory MPs believe this is the wrong time to oust the Prime Minister, even if they want her to go eventually.\n\nLike potential cabinet resignations, this process may lag behind \u2014 in the meanwhile, Graham Brady MP will be one of the most keenly watched members of the house for days to come.\n\nUpdate 2055 \u2014 Read Barnier\u2019s Speech\n\nThe full text:\n\nWe\u2019re here together following the publishing of a declaration on the framework for our future relationship and that is the result of intense negotiations started 17 months ago. This agreement is a decisive critical step in concluding the negotiations. It\u2019s also the achievement of a methodology which has been carried out in transparency from the word go and fully in the respective mandates. This draft agreement has 118 articles, 3 protocols a series of annexes. This is the draft. There are no more colours, no bits in green as before. \u2018White is the new green,\u2019 so to speak, and I certainly hope each and every one of you will take time to read the whole of the text. This is a very specific and detailed document, as you will expect from an international document bringing legal certainty to all those people and all the subjects with respect to managing the consequences of Brexit. CITIZENS RIGHTS\n\nFive of those \u2014 citizens rights have always been our common priority. And it has been established that during the transition they can live their lives as before \u2014 to study, work, to receive benefits or to be joined by their families there throughout their lifetime. FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT\n\nAnd then there is the financial settlement. We have agreed that the financial commitments be respected amongst the 28 \u2014 ALL those financial commitments. Together, we wanted to assure all those regions that have projects supported by the European Union [continue to be supported]. EURATOM AND INTELLECTUAL RIGHTS\n\nAnd my third point on which we agreed is on an orderly withdrawal, for example those questions related to Euratom, the protection of existing intellectual rights\u2026 and there is the use and protection of data. GOVERNANCE OF THE WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT\n\nOne fourth major area where I think we found a good solution is the governance of the withdrawal agreement. It is important for us and the UK that this agreement be well implemented. This draft agreement creates a framework of political resolution for dispute and where the disagreement falls into EU law, the court of justice will continue to play its role. TRANSITION PERIOD\n\nIn the fifth point, we have agreed on a transition period. The UK will leave the EU and all the institutions on the 29th of march 2019. But for a period of 21 months from the 30th of March 2019 to the 31st of Dec 2020, we have agreed to preserve the current situation with respect to the internal market, with respect to the customs union and with respect to the European policies and rights that go along with it. This allows for businesses and individuals to adapt and prepare. We also have the possibility to extend this once by a limited period. THREE PROTOCOLS\n\nThis agreement includes three protocols: GIBRALTAR PROTOCOL\n\nOne of those protocols is on Gibraltar. That creates the basis for administration on a series of subjects, the rights of citizens, taxation, tobacco, fisheries, the environment, but also police and customs cooperation, arranged thanks to the bilateral cooperation between the UK and Spain. CYPRUS PROTOCOL\n\nThe second protocol relates to Cyprus\u2019s sovereign bases. This enables for the continuity of existing protocols in particular enabling the 11,000 Cypriot citizens established on territories under British sovereignty to continue to live as they do today. NORTHERN IRELAND PROTOCOL AND THE BACKSTOP\n\nThe third protocol concerns Ireland and Northern Ireland. We have now found a solution to avoid a hard border and the dividing of Ireland. First, we will use our best endeavours to solve this issue for the long term through official agreement. If we are not ready by July 2020, we could jointly consider extending the transition to provide for more time. Only if, at the end of the transition, extended or not, we are still not there would the backstop solution we agreed kick in. This backstop solution has evolved considerably from the original EU proposal from February this year. Over the last few weeks we have worked with the UK on the basis of their proposal. In the backstop scenario, we agreed to create an EU-UK single customs territory where Northern Ireland will stay in the same territory as the rest of the UK. Northern Ireland would remain aligned with those rules of the single market that are essential to preventing a hard border. The UK would apply the EU\u2019s customs code in Northern Ireland. It would allow Northern Ireland to bring goods into the Single Market without restrictions. The text also makes clear that the Northern Irish economy retains unfettered market access to the rest of the UK. This single EU-UK customs territory would mean that UK goods get tariffs and quota free access to the EU 27 market. For competition to be fair in such a single customs territory, we have agreed taxation and environmental standards.This will ensure that UK manufacturing will compete on a level playing field. An essential condition for the single customs territory to cover fisheries and agriculture products will be agreed between the Union and the UK on access to waters and fishing opportunities. Overall this backstop shows we have been able to meet common ground to protect the Good Friday Agreement, to preserve the Single Market and Ireland\u2019s place in it, to respect the UK\u2019s territorial integrity and constitutional order, and to protect the common travel area. is backstop is not meant to be used. Our objective is to make a new agreement. THE FUTURE RELATIONSHIP\n\nThis leads me to my final point on the framework for the future relationship. We will be ready to start that netotation on 30th March 2019. What we have today is a political statement and we\u2019re drawing a basis for a new partnership which is a free trade area based on regulator and customs cooperation in depth and with a level playing field. Our objective is to abolish customs duties and quotas based on what we\u2019ve proposed in the withdrawal agreement. We will be looking to police and security cooperation, foreign policy, external security, and defence. We\u2019re going to start working with the 27 member states and I will start working tomorrow with the Parliament with the objective of the UK to finalise the declaration to present it to the European Council. FINAL THOUGHTS\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, we have reached a crucial stage. There is still a lot of work. I know that the path is still long and difficult to arrange an orderly withdrawal, but also to build an ambitious and sustainable partnership with the UK. There is still work to be done here [in the EU]. This negotiation has never been one against the other \u2014 we have always negotiated with the United Kingdom, not against, in respect of their sovereign choice to leave the European Union. Tonight is a crucial step in an orderly withdrawal and a basis for building trust before a new relationship. The United Kingdom will always be our friend, our partner, our ally. I believe that we have made decisive progress.\n\nUpdate 2050 \u2014 Brexit leader Nigel Farage is angry\n\nFarage said today is a historical low point in the trust between elector and elected in his daily spot on London talk radio station LBC.

There have been no resignations among these dissatisfied members yet, but the fallout from the so-called Chequers meeting which saw the resignations of Brexiteer big-hitters David Davis and Boris Johnson took days to materialise.\n\nThe atmosphere within today\u2019s meeting was apparently even more fraught than at Chequers.

These documents were the result of thousands of hours of hard negotiation by UK officials and many meetings with EU countries. I firmly believe that the draft EU agreement is the best that could be negotiated and it was for the cabinet to decide whether to move on in the talks. The choices before us were difficult \u2014 particularly in relation to the Northern Ireland backstop. But the collective decision on the cabinet was that we should agree the draft agreement and the outlined political declaration. This is a decision which enables us to move on and finalise the deal in the days ahead. These decisions were not taken lightly, but I believe it is in the national interest. When you strip out the details, the choice was clear. This deal delivers on the referendum which brings back control of our money, laws, and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs and ensures security and union. Or leave with no deal, or no Brexit at all. I know that there will be difficult days ahead and there will be intense scrutiny which is entirely as it should be. But the choice was this deal that allows us to take back control, and build a bright future for our country or going back to square one with more division and uncertainty and a failure to deliver on the referendum.

Former UFC champion Ronda Rousey has taken the WWE by storm since making her professional wrestling debut earlier this year.\n\nRousey has taken on and taken out the likes of Stephanie McMahon, Nia Jax, Alexa Bliss, and the Bella Twins, all while paying homage to the late great Roddy Piper. Rousey not only dresses like the Hall Of Famer on her way into the ring, she\u2019s even inherited Piper\u2019s \u201cRowdy\u201d moniker. She has lived up to it all. Piper would be proud.\n\nRousey fights with the spirit of Piper. She likes to get rough. She likes to throw a flurry of blows at her opponents from all angles. But while Piper was more of a street fighter, Rousey is all that and a supreme technician at the same time. She\u2019s masterfully adapted her skills from Judo, a sport in which she won an Olympic medal, and her MMA talents into a repertoire of pure devastation. Rousey has stood up to every woman and even some men (Triple H, Kurt Angle, Baron Corbin) that have stood in her way.\n\nRousey\u2019s rise in wrestling has been rapid and exciting. She captured the RAW Women\u2019s Championship in August and she has not looked back. Rousey remains undefeated and she\u2019s seemingly up for any challenge. But while those in-ring challenges are getting more and more challenging (Rousey was set to face WWE SmackDown champion Becky Lynch at Survivor Series until Lynch was scratched after suffering a concussion and replaced by Charlotte Flair), Rousey also has no problem taking on a whole generation of snowflakes.\n\nOn the latest edition of RAW, Rousey cut a promo going after Lynch, her next scheduled opponent. Lynch recently adopted the nickname \u2018The Man\u2019 as in \u2018UDA Man\u2019, and Rousey went after that as well. In the process, Rousey also took down the latte loving lads among us.\n\n\u201cBecky, you are so hypersensitive,\u201d said Rousey. \u201cYou\u2019re not just \u2018The Man\u2019, you are the Millennial man. You are the skinny jeans wearing, V-neck sporting, avocado toast munching, winged shoe wearing Millennial man with a bubble wrapped ego and a porcelain self-perception. Someone needs to tell \u2018The Man\u2019 that I am not Charlotte Flair, RAW is not SmackDown, and being offended doesn\u2019t make you right. So you can put the violins away, champ. You are not Oliver Twist and I am not some trust fund baby golden child.\u201d\n\nThe shots are directed at Lynch but the sentiment toward today\u2019s wimpy males is just as piercing. While Rousey was trying to get Lynch\u2019s goat, she also painted a word picture of today\u2019s typical Bernie Sanders rally attendees.\n\n\u201cEvery fan that I got has watched me sweat for every single ounce of their respect,\u201d Rousey continued. \u201cThey\u2019ve watched me bleed for every little inch of progress. They\u2019ve watched me mourn every single setback, and I sure as hell didn\u2019t pour my heart and soul into changing the meaning of \u2018Fight Like A Girl\u2019 so the leader of the women\u2019s evolution could call herself \u2018The Man\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe message transcends wrestling. We are living in a society in which many men act in a way that is anything but manly. Liberals embrace this sissification of America. Thankfully, there are huge purse winners like Rousey who still recognize the difference between real men and those who carry a man purse.\n\nWhether you\u2019re on Team Ronda or Team Becky, you have to love the rowdy one\u2019s smack down of soy boys worldwide.

Those forced into the camps suffer torture and abuse at the hands of government agents, reportedly forced to memorize communist propaganda songs, learn Mandarin, and pledge allegiance to Xi Jinping personally. Chinese officials claim the camps are \u201cvocational centers\u201d providing underprivileged minorities an education.\n\nThe bills introduced \u2013 both titled the \u201cUyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2018\u201d \u2013 urge the U.S. government to seek Global Magnitsky Act sanctions against Communist Party leaders in charge of the camps and urge the State Department to establish a special position for a Uighur rights expert to examine the human rights situation in Xinjiang.\n\nReps. Chris Smith (R-NJ) and Thomas Suozzi (D-NY) are introducing the bill in the House, while Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Bob Menendez (D-NJ) are introducing it in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThese type of abuses are happening to the Uyghurs and other Muslims in China and it is appalling, over one million interned in camps without charges; children taken from interned parents and considered orphans; forced renunciation of faith; torture and mistreatment,\u201d Rep. Smith told Breitbart News. \u201cThe \u2018reeducation camps\u2019 have become concentration camps which do not have a place in the 21stcentury. Chinese government officials should be held accountable for their complicity in this evil, and US businesses should be barred\u2014for security and human rights reasons\u2014from helping China build a high-tech police state in Xinjiang province.\u201d\n\nThe Global Magnitsky Act grants the executive branch the power to sanction individuals with positions in foreign governments for engaging in human rights violations. Among potential sanctions are revocation of visas into the United States and banning American individuals and corporations from doing business with the targeted persons.\n\nThe Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act suggests the State Department should:\n\nimpose targeted sanctions on members of the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party, and state security apparatus, including Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo and other officials credibly alleged to be responsible for human rights abuses in Xinjiang and elsewhere.\n\nChen is believed to be the head of the internment camp system. Prior to his appointment to Party Secretary in Xinjiang, Chen served in Tibet, where he was responsible for establishing an elaborate surveillance and oppression system to monitor the activities of Tibetan Buddhist separatists. Having successfully imposed the new surveillance system, Beijing officials brought him to Xinjiang to replicate the project on the Uighur population.\n\nChina has dramatically increased the persecution of religious minorities under Communist Party leader Xi Jinping. While the internment camps are currently believed to only house Muslims, Xi\u2019s government imposed heavy surveillance in Tibet and has also launched a national crackdown on Christianity, which is less associated with any one minority ethnic group than Buddhism or Islam in China.\n\n\u201cThe Uyghur issue is one of the world\u2019s worst human rights situations, including efforts to severely restrict Islam and to equate religious faith with terrorism and extremism. But China under Xi Jinping is an equal opportunity abuser of religious freedom,\u201d Rep. Smith told Breitbart News. \u201d The religious freedom situation overall has deteriorated in China, including for Christians.\u201d\n\nIn a press statement, Sen. Menendez described the situation in Xinjiang as \u201cbeyond abhorrent,\u201d arguing it \u201cshines a light of China\u2019s surveillance state tactics that threaten basic human dignity.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has been on the forefront of highlighting the abuse of Uighurs in Xinjiang through its State Department, which published an extensive report on abuses there in April. That month, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Laura Stone told reporters that the Trump administration was considering sanctions on Chinese Communist Party officials over the matter.\n\nAccording to the State Department report and testimony from Uighurs who have survived the camps, Beijing has interned at least one million people in Xinjiang in 44 known camps in the state. The prisoners are forced to eat pork to make them less Muslim and memorize communist party songs or face physical and psychological torture, including food and sleep deprivation, being forced to spend hours frozen in uncomfortable crouching positions, or beaten by police.\n\nThe crackdown has triggered a wave of migrants to flee across Xinjiang\u2019s border with Afghanistan. This week, Chinese authorities announced they would deploy thousands of soldiers in a \u201cborder patrol\u201d effort to the region to keep Uighurs from fleeing.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying responded to the bills in her regular press briefing on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt is really a wonder to me that these lawmakers think they are so superior that they can point fingers at other countries\u2019 domestic affairs,\u201d she asserted. \u201cHow much do they know about the real situation in other countries? And how much do they know about the situation inside their own?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are spending their taxpayers\u2019 money, but instead of focusing on serving their people, they always choose to ignore myriad problems facing their own country and are too obsessed with poking their noses in the domestic affairs of others,\u201d Hua complained, launching into a speech about alleged racial discrimination in the United States.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "While speaking at the National Action Network Legislative & Policy Conference on Wednesday, Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) stated that if Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams doesn\u2019t win the Georgia governor\u2019s race, \u201cthey stole it.\u201d\n\nBrown said, \u201c[W]e\u2019ll never give in on voting rights.

Eyewitness accounts say the police and, at least on one occasion, unidentified black-clad men kidnapped them.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Jasic Workers Support Group (JWSG), police arrested and assaulted a number of their members in simultaneous operations at college campuses in Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Shanghai on Friday evening. The government has also deleted their social media accounts.\n\nThe most dramatic accounts came from Peking University, where several students said a squad of black-clad mystery men beat them, threw them to the ground, and kicked them, dragging one of them into a car and driving away. The Jasic Workers Support Group implied that some of the witnesses who reported the kidnapping have gone into seclusion for their own safety.\n\nPeking University responded to the reports of a kidnapping by insisting the incident was merely the \u201cpolice department lawfully taking into custody a criminal suspect.\u201d The university said this individual was not a \u201ccurrent student, teacher, or employee of the school.\u201d\n\nThe JWSG statement claimed police in Guangdong province \u201cviolently broke into the dormitories of members\u201d and \u201ctook away our comrades.\u201d\n\nMembers of the JWSG are no strangers to the inside of Chinese prison cells. Police have conducted raids against the group for months, largely on the grounds that its protest activities are unacceptably disruptive. Other activist groups have complained about the rough treatment given to Jasic campaigners, often held in jail or placed under house arrest without due process.\n\nOppression is nothing new in Communist China, but the twist is that JWSG and other student groups recently hit by crackdowns are avid Marxists. Hardcore anti-business activism has become inconvenient for Communist Party leader Xi Jinping\u2019s corporatist agenda. His philosophy has much more in common with early 20th Century industrial fascism than Marxism, and his goals depend on wooing foreign companies for big business deals that bring then inexorably under Chinese control. It is necessary for Xi to trim China\u2019s Marxist sails to accomplish these goals, so a number of bewildered true believers in communist fundamentalism suddenly find themselves in jail.\n\nXi and his government have tried to suppress the Chinese labor movement for years, intimidating workers away from grassroots trade unions and forcing them into government-administered trade federations that do a better job of controlling disgruntled workers than representing them. Beijing has denounced grassroots labor groups as foreign conspiracies to \u201csabotage the unity of the working class.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat have we been doing in the Marxism Research Club? We only read Marxist works. What is wrong about that?\u201d a protester asked at Nanjing University a few weeks ago, summing up the angry confusion of Little Red Book purists who suddenly find themselves tailed by plainclothes police officers.\n\nThe government still forces citizens to revere the author of that fabled communist tract, Chairman Mao Tse-tung, as a titan of Chinese history on par with the all-powerful Xi Jinping, but Xi\u2019s officials are reportedly quietly worried about Mao becoming a figurehead for the poor and alienated, so they have been tearing down Mao statues and deleting websites dedicated to his memory.\n\nMaoist websites have been shut down, sometimes by physically destroying their computers, trashing their offices, and arresting their writers. Government agents \u201cdisappeared\u201d the entire staff of one Maoist site in August. Many hardcore communists found it expedient to migrate to Hong Kong, whose semi-autonomous status grants somewhat greater freedom of speech and assembly than mainland Chinese enjoy, although possibly not for much longer.\n\nOne political commentator told Radio Free Asia on Sunday the Chinese government created a vacuum for hardcore Marxists by cracking down hard on \u201cliberals\u201d over the past few years \u2013 in other words, the more benevolent activists who criticized their government for trampling on free speech and political rights.\n\nThe name of the Jasic Workers Support Group refers to the Jasic Technology factory in Shenzhen, where activists claim owners have used oppressive tactics to prevent workers from forming a trade union.

Weeks ago, his former boss sent word to his community via recruiters that construction jobs await him and others to build stores like Wal-Marts and Home Depots \u2014 the kind of construction work he once did here in the U.S., the very work that once helped him earn enough money to build a home back in Honduras. \u201cI\u2019m told the economy is very good again,\u201d he said. \u201cI know from past experience that when there are jobs there will be a way to get in. It\u2019s about resolve, and God, not Trump.\u201d\n\nMany of the migrants learn about open jobs via their cellphone-linked network of relatives already working in the United States:\n\nAs they watched TV about the latest caravan, both perked up. [Honduran Juan Carlos] Rivera immediately called his uncle Wilfredo in Dallas who told him about a construction job. Another cousin in Miami told him about a roofing job. A caravan meant not paying thousands of dollars to a smuggler. Plus, there was safety in numbers. He and wife talked into the night. By morning, his wife and daughter left their town to move to an undisclosed place, away from imminent danger. Rivera took a bus and headed for Guatemala where he met the caravan.\n\nFive million Central American adults want to migrate into the United States, according to a Gallup survey published right after the midterm elections.\n\nThe Dallas News article, to its credit, does not treat the migrants as hapless victims but treats them as striving humans trying to do the best they can for themselves and their families.\n\nBut the Dallas News \u2014 like nearly all establishment outlets \u2014 completely disdains the interests of Americans, including the blue-collar Americans whose wages will fall as Central Americans rush to take blue-collar jobs offered by unscrupulous U.S. employers. The article suggests Americans do not have a rational reaction to cheap-labor migration but are instead herded by political manipulation from President Donald Trump:\n\nThe [migration] increase undoubtedly fuels some of the rancor against immigrants and asylum-seekers now coming from the White House. Trump used the caravan to ignite anti-immigrant sentiments and rally his base and justify the deployment of thousands of troops at the southwest border.\n\nBut many polls show the public rationally opposes cheap-labor immigration because of its economic impact on fellow Americans and their children.\n\nBusiness groups and Democrats tout skewed polls which prod Americans to declare support for migrants and for the claim that the United States is an economy-expanding \u201cNation of Immigrants,\u201d not a nation of Americans.\n\nThe alternative \u201cpriority or fairness\u201d polls \u2014 plus the 2016 election \u2014 show that voters in the polling booth put a much higher priority on helping their families, neighbors, and fellow nationals get decent jobs in a high-tech, high-immigration, low-wage economy.\n\nThe Dallas News article also suggests that companies\u2019 collective desire for cheap, mobile and disposable workers is a \u201cneed\u201d which overwhelms Americans\u2019 rational desire for investment and jobs in their home towns, saying:\n\nEconomists say the U.S. job market is in need of hundreds of thousands of workers, many in the kinds of low-paying jobs that immigrants \u2014 authorized or not \u2014 often fill.\n\nAmericans have long assumed that companies and investors who are trying to fill lower-wage jobs in a tight national labor-market would be pressured to offer higher wages and to invest in labor-saving machinery.\n\nBut investors do not need to offer higher wages or raise productivity if the government allows them to employ mobile workers from outside the national labor market and also supplements the migrants\u2019 low wages with hidden taxpayer subsidies of aid, welfare and free schooling for their children. Also, the extra inflow of migrants provides investors and government agencies with many extra customers for food, autos, apartments, and government services.\n\nA tacit alliance of progressives and investors, Democrats and Republicans, has largely blocked Trump\u2019s efforts to help ordinary Americans by curbing migration into U.S. workplaces and neighborhoods.\n\nWashington\u2019s economic policy of using migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe policy also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids\u2019 schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.\n\nImmigration also pulls investment and wealth away from heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and manage the large immigrant populations living in the coastal states.\n\nRead the Dallas News article here.", "Bob Woodward, veteran journalist of Watergate fame, criticized CNN for suing the White House over the temporary suspension of reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s \u201chard pass\u201d press credential, saying many members of the media are \u201cemotionally unhinged\u201d over President Donald Trump, reports Fox News.\n\n\u201cToo many people for Trump or against Trump have become emotionally unhinged about this,\u201d Woodward told attendees of the Global Financial Leadership Conference in Naples, Florida. \u201cThe remedy [isn\u2019t a lawsuit], it\u2019s more serious reporting about what he\u2019s doing,\u201d the Fear author added.\n\nWoodward also cautioned the network was taking the President Trump\u2019s \u201cbait\u201d in hiring former U.S. Solicitor General Ted Olson to lead the case. \u201cThis is a negative,\u201d Woodward argued. \u201cTrump is sitting around saying, \u2018This is great!\u2019\u201d\n\nWoodward, a frequent critic of the administration, accused President Trump last month of purposely \u201cstoking the fires\u201d of political division. \u201c[W]hen he goes out in these rallies, they are all designed to raise the boiling point, raise the temperature, and that is contributing. We know presidents have extraordinary power. He has probably more power than any president I\u2019ve reported on, going back to Nixon. And he has seized it with the communication channel, with the tweeting and the rallies and the press conferences,\u201d the longtime reporter told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper.\n\nLast week, the administration announced it was taking away Acosta\u2019s pass after a tense exchange with President Trump in which he refused to relinquish a microphone when prompted by a White House intern.\n\nOn Tuesday, CNN sued the president in a District Court in Washington, D.C. in a bid to have Acosta\u2019s pass reinstated. The network claims barring its White House correspondent will have \u201ca dangerous chilling effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the suit is specific to CNN and Acosta, this could have happened to anyone,\u201d a statement released via CNN reads. \u201cIf left unchallenged, the actions of the White House would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials.\u201d\n\nResponding to the lawsuit, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement: \u201cthis is just more grandstanding from CNN, and we will vigorously defend against his lawsuit.\u201d\n\nFox News, NBC, and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists announced Wednesday that they not only support CNN\u2019s lawsuit but will file an amicus brief in defense of the network.", "Staff of the U.S. Education Department say rumors that secretary Betsy DeVos will be resigning her post are unfounded.\n\n\u201cThe rumors are just that \u2026 rumors,\u201d DeVos\u2019s press secretary Elizabeth Hill reportedly said in an email statement, reports USA Today. \u201cThe Secretary has no plans of stepping down.\u201d\n\nDeVos has critics on both the left and the right, but Democrats who will soon control the House say they plan to call the secretary before key committees for questioning.\n\nDemocrats have long supported a strong federal education department that heavily funds public schools, holds them accountable to carry out the Party\u2019s social justice agenda, and keeps the teacher union base content.\n\nIn a recent interview with the New American, Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie (R) noted, \u201cThe left understands that this is where you win or lose \u2013 in the schools and in the teaching of the children.\u201d\n\nWhile DeVos has changed the focus of the department to school choice, she has not, however, fulfilled what the conservative/libertarian base of the Republican Party had viewed as Donald Trump\u2019s plan to gradually dismantle the department. The Constitution does not give the federal government authority to decide education policy.\n\nAdditionally, DeVos has hired many education staffers with ties to her longstanding colleague, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who lost in the 2016 GOP primary race, in part, because of his advocacy for the Common Core standards. The secretary also recently appointed former Democrat Gov. Beverly Perdue of North Carolina, to head the National Assessment Governing Board. Like Bush, Perdue is a longtime champion of Common Core.\n\nAmong the issues Politico reported House Democrats will aggressively address with DeVos is the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmoves to stop state-led scrutiny of federal student loan servicers.\u201d\n\nThe report observed that Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, \u201cis expected to lead the House Appropriations subcommittee overseeing education funding.\u201d DeLauro had \u201cclashed with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos over the issue earlier this year,\u201d noted Politico.\n\nTeachers\u2019 unions are eager to have their newly elevated Democrat representatives interrogate DeVos.\n\nThe National Education Association (NEA) said in a statement after the midterm elections that Democrats are now \u201cpositioned to shift the balance of power in state capitals and the U.S. Congress, where victories will add a critical check on policies that have hurt students, their families and communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cLawmakers learned an important lesson \u2026 You can either work with educators to address the needs of students and public education, or they will work to elect someone who will,\u201d said NEA president Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda. \u201cCandidates across the country witnessed unprecedented activism by educators in their races.

It gives another $100 million to various Palestinian terrorist groups, including Hamas. Combined with the money that Tehran provides to other terrorists, the total bill comes close to $1 billion a year,\u201d Ambassador Sales said.\n\n\u201cSadly, it is the Iranian people who are forced to pay this price,\u201d he added. \u201cThe resources that Iran uses to fund its global terrorist ambitions are resources that come directly out of the pockets of everyday, average Iranians. The regime robs its own citizens to pay its proxies abroad.\u201d\n\nAssistant Secretary of Diplomatic Security Mike Evanoff announced that the State Department\u2019s \u201cRewards for Justice\u201d program is now offering rewards of up to $5 million for information on several Iran-sponsored terrorists, specifically Hamas leader Salih al-Aruri and Lebanese Hezbollah leaders Khalil Yusuf Mahmoud Harb and Haytham Ali Tabatabai.\n\nEvanoff said Aruri is \u201ccurrently living freely in Lebanon\u201d and reportedly works directly with Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the wing of the Iranian military commanded by the ayatollahs. Aruri has been linked to numerous terrorist actions, including the abduction and murder of dual U.S.-Israeli citizen Naftali Frenkel in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe Hamas and Hezbollah organizations receive weapons, training, and funding from Iran, which the Secretary of State has designated as a state sponsor of terrorism,\u201d Evanoff said. \u201cThe Department of State designated both Hamas and Hezbollah as foreign terrorist organizations in October 1997, and as specially designated global terrorist entities in October 2001.\u201d\n\nSales noted Hezbollah\u2019s designation as a foreign terrorist organization is up for a mandatory five-year review but will be maintained.\n\n\u201cAll told, the Trump administration has already designated more than 40 Hezbollah-related individuals and entities this year alone, with a total of 160 to date,\u201d he reported.\n\n\u201cThe actions we\u2019re announcing today are one more step in our campaign to build the toughest sanctions regime ever imposed on Iran. More sanctions are coming, and they will continue until Iran and its proxies change their behavior,\u201d Sales promised.\n\n\u201cIran must follow the same rules that every other civilized nation follows and renounce terrorism as a basic tool of statecraft. We will continue to ratchet up the pressure until Iran joins the community of civilized nations and ceases its support for murder and mayhem around the globe,\u201d he said.\n\nSales also had strong words for the government of Lebanon, which he criticized for allowing terrorists to live comfortably and operate freely. He said it was \u201cintolerable\u201d for any senior Hamas leader to \u201cenjoy freedom of movement in any country.\u201d\n\nEvanoff warned that Iran-backed terror groups are spreading their influence across the Middle East, as in the case of Hezbollah\u2019s branch in Iraq, which is openly in command of \u201cPopular Mobilization Force\u201d militia units sanctioned by the government in Baghdad.\n\n\u201cThey seek to destabilize the regions where they\u2019re active. They have access to weapons and training provided by Iran. They receive funding from Iran,\u201d Evanoff said of these groups.\n\nSales refused to comment on media speculation that the Trump administration might designate the Houthi insurgency in Yemen a foreign terrorist organization supported by Iran, but he said it was \u201cintolerable that the Houthis are launching Iran-origin munitions into Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe expect that any country will abide by the standard rules that apply to the international system, one of the most basic of which is do not lob missiles at your neighbors,\u201d the ambassador said drily.\n\nSales said one of the Trump administration\u2019s top goals is to deprive Iran of the \u201cresources they need to commit terrorism and acts of violence around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cSadly, this is a core component of Iranian policy, so we\u2019re going to have to keep squeezing them. Seven hundred million dollars a year for Hezbollah can buy a lot of bullets and a lot of bombs, so we\u2019re going to continue to ramp up the pressure,\u201d he said.\n\nReporters asked Nauert to comment on Iraqi official statements that their country is too heavily dependent on Iranian gas, oil, and electricity to abide by U.S. sanctions after the temporary waiver granted to Iraq expires in 45 days.\n\nNauert cited the shortage of electricity in southern Iraq over the summer, accompanied by political unrest in the region, as one of the reasons a waiver was granted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident that this waiver will help Iraq limit its electricity shortages into the south. I\u2019m not going to get ahead of any of the decisions or actions that we might take in the near future, but 45 days we think is important. We\u2019ll continue to discuss this with Iraq,\u201d she said.", "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is engaged in a full-on campaign for the House Speakership and is taking nothing for granted. Her move comes as more Democrats come out against her nascent bid to regain the Speaker\u2019s gavel she lost when Republicans took the majority in the 2010 midterm elections.\n\nWhile Democrats retook the House majority in the 2018 midterms, a new Democrat majority that will be seated in January 2019, Pelosi\u2019s bid for another term as Speaker is anything but certain. While she remains the favorite, and has no intra-Democrat Party challenger, Pelosi\u2019s struggle to get to 218 votes\u2013the majority necessary to win the Speakership on the floor of the House of Representatives\u2013could not be clearer.\n\nOn Monday, two senior Democrats\u2013Reps. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO) and Kurt Schrader (D-OR)\u2013made clear in comments to Politico that they would not be supporting Pelosi. Now, late Tuesday in comments to CNN, two more Democrats\u2013Reps. Seth Moulton (D-MA) and Filemon Vela (D-TX)\u2013joined the public opposition to Pelosi\u2019s speakership candidacy with warnings that she will not have the votes necessary to retake the gavel.\n\n\u201cI am 100% confident we can forge new leadership,\u201d Vela said, with Moulton adding that he believes anti-Pelosi Democrats\u2019 chances are also at \u201c100%.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are trying to do the right thing for the party by solving this ahead of time,\u201d Moulton said.\n\nPelosi, meanwhile, fired back at Moulton on Wednesday, dismissing his certainty that she would fail with certainty she would succeed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a busy person, but I will be the speaker of the House no matter what he said,\u201d Pelosi said in response to Moulton on Wednesday.\n\nPelosi will almost certainly win the nomination of the Democrat conference later in November, as she only needs a majority of the majority to vote for her to be the Democrats\u2019 nominee for Speaker in the early January House floor election. But it is on the House floor where she may have trouble locking down the Speakership, as any candidate running must win a majority of those members present and voting for a person to win the Speakership\u2013voting present is a throwaway vote because it does not count toward the total and lowers the number that Pelosi would need to win. In other words, assuming all 435 voting members of the House vote for a person, Pelosi would need 218 votes to retake the Speaker\u2019s gavel. And she has little margin for error.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported earlier this week, Pelosi\u2019s margin for error is less than 20 votes but may be as little as a dozen:\n\nWhen all is said and done from last Tuesday\u2019s midterms\u2013there are still nine outstanding House races\u2013Democrats could have a majority as high as 236 seats but definitely will have at least 227. That final number is going to be critical for Democrats\u2019 hopes of securing Pelosi as speaker, as every number extra that Democrats add to the final total is an extra vote Pelosi can afford to lose. If Republicans sweep those nine remaining races, a very unlikely outcome, and Democrats enter the new Congress with 227 votes, Pelosi can only afford to lose nine Democrats on the floor. Democrats, however, are very likely to pick up a number of the nine outstanding seats. They currently lead Republicans in four of them: California\u2019s 10th District, New Jersey\u2019s 3rd District, New York\u2019s 22nd, and Utah\u2019s 4th District. Republicans lead Democrats in the other five: California\u2019s 39th and 45th Districts, and Georgia\u2019s 7th, as well as Maine\u2019s 2nd, and Texas\u2019s 23rd Districts. If these races are finalized the way they stand now, Democrats will have 231 votes in the House\u2013which means Pelosi can afford to lose 13 Democrats in her bid for the speakership\u2013but if they all go to the Democrats in the end, Democrats would have 236 votes, and Pelosi would be able to afford to lose 18 votes from Democrats in the speaker\u2019s race. In other words, depending on how these final races shake out, Pelosi\u2019s margin for error could be anywhere from nine to eighteen votes; the higher the number, the harder it is for the intra-conference rebels to successfully block her.\n\nThe way a Speakership election works is that at the beginning of a Congress, candidates are introduced and then members\u2013in alphabetical order\u2013are called to vote. If no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast for a person, then the business of Congress is held up until such time as a Speaker can be elected on future ballots. This is precisely the strategy that anti-Pelosi Democrat are employing: While they do not have a challenger ready, and do not intend to, what they aim to do is tank Pelosi\u2019s chances on the first ballot with the presumption that alternative candidates with fresher visions for leadership would emerge on future ballots.\n\n\u201cThe Pelosi opponents don\u2019t have anyone ready to challenge her, but are trying to garner enough signatures of lawmakers promising to vote against her on the floor to show that she cannot be elected,\u201d Politico\u2019s Bade wrote on Wednesday.\n\nAs such, and with a growing rebellion against her among House Democrats old and new\u2013not only have these four veteran members joined the anti-Pelosi resistance but newly elected incoming Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) was spotted at a protest at Pelosi\u2019s office this week\u2013Pelosi is leaving nothing to chance in her ruthless campaign for the speakership.\n\nAccording to another Politico report late on Tuesday, Pelosi has been amping her campaign for the Speakership.\n\n\u201cPelosi secretly showed up at the Congressional Progressive Caucus\u2019 freshman orientation session on Monday to try to ingratiate herself with about 20 members-elect in attendance,\u201d Politico\u2019s Rachael Bade and John Bresnahan wrote. \u201cThere, Pelosi played up her role creating the caucus as an original founding member of the group and touted her background working as a progressive community organizer in California. On Tuesday afternoon, Pelosi held a reception for all Democrats at Osteria Morini, an Italian restaurant by the D.C. waterfront. On Wednesday, the members-elect will be introduced to their colleagues at a Democratic Caucus meeting, a lengthy process that will put them onstage with Pelosi. The California Democrat will follow that up with an appearance at the Congressional Black Caucus, a powerful faction inside the Democratic Caucus. Then, Pelosi will host a private dinner for members-elect and their spouses Wednesday evening in Statuary Hall, right off the House floor.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not all: Pelosi, according to Bresnahan and Bade, has enlisted several top Democrat Party luminaries and power players to pressure members and members-elect on her behalf. Failed Democrat presidential candidates former Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. John Kerry (D-MA), also the former Secretary of State, as well as Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, are reportedly calling Democrats in the incoming House majority to lobby them to vote for Pelosi for Speaker.\n\nThe Politico piece lists out four other Democrats who are coming into the new Congress as opposed to Pelosi\u2019s Speakership bid as well, Reps.-elect Abigail Spanberger (D-VA), Joe Cunningham (D-SC), Jason Crow (D-CO), and Max Rose (D-NY). That puts the total anti-Pelosi floor votes at at least eight, meaning she is walking a very fine line as her detractors nearly have what they need to stop her already.\n\n\u201cI am not voting for her \u2014 no if, ands or buts, under any circumstances,\u201d Rose said on Fox News, per Politico.", "Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol agents stopped migrants with histories of violence, gang membership, and sex offenses from successfully making their way into the U.S. interior.

During an immigration interview, the agents learned that the migrant came from El Salvador. A criminal history check revealed sexual abuse of a child or minor. A Washington, D.C. court convicted the man on the charge and sentenced him to 180 days in confinement, according to Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol officials.\n\nLater that day, McAllen Station agents apprehended a Guatemalan national near Sullivan City. The agents arrested the illegal immigrant and transported him for processing and a background investigation. Agents found court records that indicated the Guatemalan received a conviction from a court in Los Angeles, California, in 2016 for lascivious acts with a child. The court sentenced the man to one year in confinement.\n\nTwo days earlier, McAllen Station agents arrested a Mexican man near Mission, Texas. A biometric background investigation revealed the Grant County, Washington, Sheriff\u2019s Office arrested the illegal immigrant from Mexico on a charge of rape of a child. The Washington State court convicted the man and sentenced him to serve nine-months confinement.\n\nOn Friday morning, agents assigned to the Falfurrias Border Patrol Checkpoint, located on U.S. Highway 281 about 80 miles north of the U.S. border with Mexico, arrested a U.S. citizen for allegedly attempting to smuggle a group of 22 illegal immigrants. The agents took the group of migrants to the station for a background investigation. During a records check, agents learned that one of the men received a conviction from a Salvadoran court for aggravated homicide. The court sentenced the man to 18 years in prison.\n\nAnd finally, the La Joya Police Department contacted the McAllen Border Patrol Station on Thursday about a failed human smuggling attempt. Agents responded to the scene and identified two of the subjects as illegal immigrants. The agents transported the migrants to the station for a background check that revealed one of the men to be a known member of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gang.\n\nAll of the illegal immigrants will be processed according to Rio Grande Valley Sector guidelines.

The contract calls for the building of approximately eight miles of new or replacement border barriers beginning in February 2019.\n\nDubbed RGV-02, the CBP and USACE awarded a contract to build five segments of enhanced border barriers in the Rio Grande Valley Sector (RGV). The RGV Sector is the nation\u2019s busiest in terms of the number of apprehensions of illegal immigrants, family units, and unaccompanied minors, according to CBP reports. The five segments will be located south of the border communities of Alamo, Donna, Weslaco, Progresso, and Mercedes, Texas, according to CBP officials.\n\nPlans call for the construction of new barriers and improvements to existing concrete levee walls along the Rio Grande River border that separates Texas and Mexico. New tactical infrastructure will include a reinforced concrete levee wall and an 18-foot steel bollard wall on top of the levee wall.\n\nContractors will also install a 150-foot wide enforcement zone throughout the eight-mile system, officials stated. Plans also call for the installation of detection technology, video surveillance, and an all-weather road parallel to the levee wall to enable Border Patrol agents to quickly respond to attempted illegal border crossings.\n\nThe contract, awarded to SLSCO on November 11, is valued at approximately $167 million, officials stated. Construction is slated to begin in February 2019.\n\nThis is the second awarding of a border wall construction contract in the RGV Sector this month. That contract, also awarded to SLSCO, provides for an estimated $145 million to build an additional six miles of border infrastructure, Breitbart News reported.\n\nIn mid-October, CBP officials also announced the awarding of a contract to install gates to seal gaps in existing border walls in the sector.\n\nIn September, Border Patrol officials in the El Paso Sector announced the start of a construction project to replace a four-mile section of outdated border fencing technology with bollard-style walls.\n\n\u201cThis new wall will be far more durable and far more effective in deterring would-be illegal entrants,\u201d El Paso Sector Chief Patrol Agent Aaron A. Hull said in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. West Point Contractors from Tucson, Arizona, won this $22 million contract.\n\nA crucial feature of the bollard-style wall is the ability for Border Patrol agents to see through the wall. \u201cThe bollard design wall has proved beneficial to the Border Patrol to detect illegal entries and the smuggling of narcotics into the United States by providing situational awareness of activity south of the wall,\u201d officials stated.\n\n\u201cU.S. Border Patrol agents are the most frequently assaulted and most frequently injured federal law enforcement officers,\u201d Hull stated. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen time and time again that the addition of serious infrastructure creates a safer environment for our people to operate.

El Paso Sector agents apprehended a total of 7,332 migrants in October 2018. This is up from 1,489 one year ago \u2014 an increase of 392 percent. At the same time, agents in the RGV Sector apprehended 20,754 migrants last month.

In reality, this is not enough, because one can be sincerely mistaken, or one can be precise in detail but not grasp the meaning of the whole.\u201d\n\nBeing truthful goes beyond just being factual, Francis suggested, and becomes a way of life.\n\n\u201cSometimes we justify ourselves by saying, \u2018But I said what I felt!\u2019 Yes, but you have absolutized your point of view,\u201d he said. \u201cOr, \u2018I just told the truth!\u2019 Maybe, but you have revealed some personal or confidential facts.

McEnany added that \u201caccountability should rest with the individuals who lost their races.\u201d\n\nThe RNC spokesperson and former CNN contributor offered her analysis on Tuesday\u2019s edition of SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight.\n\nPollak challenged McEnany about the RNC\u2019s claims that the midterm election was a success, and the sense that no one was being responsible for losing the House.\n\n\u201cI feel that Republican voters don\u2019t have anybody to hold accountable for the loss of the House,\u201d said Pollak. \u201cIn the British parliamentary system it doesn\u2019t matter how well you do in the election if your party loses, the leader reigns and they let someone else do it. In Donald Trump\u2019s world, on the the TV show The Apprentice, when there were two teams divided up and they had a task to complete, it didn\u2019t matter if the losing team did a great a job. If they lost they had to send someone home, or Donald Trump would send someone home from the team.\u201d\n\nPollak continued, \u201cWho\u2019s taking responsibility for losing the House? I see a lot of people taking credit for holding onto a Senate seat here and there. Is nobody saying, \u2018Hey, this was our fault. We neglected suburban women,\u2019 or, \u2018We didn\u2019t invest enough in getting these absentee ballots in places where they weren\u2019t voting early. We didn\u2019t formulate a health care policy.\u2019? I just want to know, is anybody standing up and saying, \u2018We failed, and we need to do better. Maybe we need new people to do better.\u2019? Is there accountability happening? My fear is that nothing is going to change. Everybody is patting each other on the back and we\u2019re going to head into 2020 and get wiped out.\u201d\n\nMcEnany replied that the losing candidates themselves were to blame.\n\n\u201cThe accountability should rest with the individuals who lost their races,\u201d she said. She added: Most of the time, the individuals who lost were folks who did not welcome the president to their districts, who did not stand by the Trump agenda, [and] who distanced themselves from the presidency and all [its] successes. The individuals who lost, and there are many names \u2026 were people by and large who separated themselves from the Trump presidency.\n\n\u201cIt should be a lesson for all of those as we move forward into 2020 that the president\u2019s agenda is a winning one,\u201d she added. \u201cYou see it in the right direction-wrong direction polling. The right direction numbers are the highest they have been in modern history.\u201d\n\nMcEnany noted how recent polls showed approximately 40 percent of Americans viewied the country as headed in the right direction, compared with about 30 percent at the same point during former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear. The American people see our country heading in the right direction \u2026. Our nominees on the congressional [and] Senate levels need to take note that when you stand by the president you prevail. We saw that with Marsha Blackburn. We saw that with Joe Donnelly in Indiana. We saw it with Kevin Cramer in North Dakota. \u2026 When you stand against the president, you tend to lose a lot of Republican votes. After all, our president has the highest own-party approval rating of any president in modern history, other than Bush during 9/11.\u201d\n\nMcEnany concluded: \u201cSo I think who\u2019s accountable is the candidates who actually lost the race, whose names are on the ballots, and I think it should be a lesson learned going forward that standing by the president and the conservative agenda is the way to win going into 2020.\u201d\n\nMansour asked McEnany why Republicans had not been more competitive in Democrat-held districts that Trump won in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that I\u2019m most concerned about is that we didn\u2019t pick up more of the districts that voted for Trump in 2016 but were currently held by Democrats in Congress,\u201d said Mansour. \u201cThere are about 12 of those districts, and we picked up two of them, which was wonderful. But of the districts that Hillary Clinton won that were held by Republicans in Congress, there were 25 of those and Democrats picked up 18 of them. They flipped 18 of them from the GOP. It might be closer to 20, now. So Democrats are flipping [and] grabbing those districts. We didn\u2019t really put a dent in any of these blue districts that Trump won overwhelmingly, in many cases. That\u2019s really troubling to me. I\u2019m wondering, did the RNC \u2014 or GOP in general \u2014 do enough to really target those districts and to field candidates that can appeal to voters in those districts and really solidify that working class which is the new Republican Party, now?\u201d\n\nMcEnany responded, \u201cAt the RNC, we do not engage in candidate selection. We have a pretty simple rule, and it\u2019s that we allow the people to decide. We don\u2019t believe in Washington swamp meddling in elections, therefore we don\u2019t engage in candidate selection. We let the people decide who\u2019s best in their districts run. That note aside, yes, we were all in of these key districts. Yes, we made clearly millions of voter contacts, more than 62 million. [We] knocked on doors, made phone calls, but what I would add to that is \u2026 President Trump wasn\u2019t on the ballot, the Republican nominee in that district was. So we\u2019re trying to pick up seats that individuals haven\u2019t won since the 1980s in a lot of these cases.\u201d\n\nPollak asked, \u201cIs there a strategy for reaching out to these groups [of Mormons and suburban women] that seem to have less support for the president than they traditionally do [for Republicans], and what is that strategy?\u201d\n\nMcEnany answered, \u201cNumber one, when we\u2019re talking on a macro level, female voters [and] suburban women, it\u2019s very important, I think, to talk about paid family leave, things that really reach this cohort. It\u2019s something that Ivanka Trump has heralded [and] taken a lead on. There are a multiplicity of issues that we\u2019re working on that can reach out to groups that we need to make sure are on our side in the [2020] election. But when we\u2019re talking about the president and his support among voters, I think my previous point is the optimal one, which is that he has the highest support among his party of any president in modern history save Bush during 9/11.\u201d\n\nMcEnany added that Republicans are planning new tax relief proposals to appeal to the \u201cmiddle class.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Donald Trump\u2019s] room to increase support among Republicans is small because he\u2019s so high up already as to where he stands, but I think making inroads among independents [and] groups that he won over in 2016 is important; suburban women in particular,\u201d stated McEnany. \u201cAnd I think we have the arguments. We have the ability to do that when we talk about tax cuts 2.0. More tax cuts for the middle class. Making the first batch of tax cuts for the middle class permanent. These are all things that can really reach out to these groups as we look forward to 2020.\u201d\n\nShe also admitted that the party should develop a more compelling argument about health care policy and reducing the costs of health insurance.\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.", "Amazon has fixed its A.I. assistant Alexa after devices were describing CNN Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta as a \u201cfake journalist.\u201d\n\nA video of Alexa\u2019s description of Acosta went viral after a man filmed himself asking his device, \u201cWho is Jim Acosta?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbilio James Acosta is an American fake journalist who is currently the Chief White House Correspondent for CNN,\u201d the device replied.\n\nAlexa\u2026.

Following that disturbing episode, the White House suspended Acosta\u2019s press credentials.\n\nCNN and Acosta responded by filing a federal lawsuit in Washington, DC, alleging violations of the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment and Fifth Amendment. The plaintiffs are suing President Trump, various White House officials like chief of staff John Kelly, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and two officers from the U.S. Secret Service: director Randolph Alles, and the unnamed agent who actually took the pass from Acosta.\n\nThis lawsuit hinges on a 1977 precedent from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, Sherrill v. Knight.\n\nCNN and Acosta will lose this lawsuit.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit was a liberal court in 1977, and the Supreme Court at the time was moderately liberal. All sorts of decisions from the Supreme Court at the time, from creating a constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade to misinterpreting the Establishment Clause into a wrecking ball against people of faith in Lemon v. Kurtzman, were stark departures from the original public meaning of the Constitution.\n\nThose days are over, as America today has what may be the most conservative Supreme Court since 1934. And there is no Supreme Court precedent on point here, so no precedents need to be overruled to get this right.\n\nA key issue the D.C. Circuit never considered is that this sort of lawsuit should be dismissed under the political-question doctrine. In Baker v. Carr, the Supreme Court in 1962 identified six factors of political cases that cannot be decided by the courts.\n\nOne Baker factor is that a federal court cannot decide the matter \u201cwithout expressing lack of respect due coordinate branches of government.\u201d The White House is the president\u2019s house. He lives there and sleeps there. Yes, it has offices, but the White House is not a department; it is not an agency created by Congress and subject to standard congressional oversight. It is, instead, the residence of the independently elected head of state, and those who work there do so as part of his household staff.\n\nCNN and Acosta are asking a federal judge to give the president orders concerning whom he must allow into his home. The executive branch is a separate, coequal branch from the judicial branch. It would be as much of an insult for a federal judge to tell the president that he must allow someone into his living room as it would be for the president to order the Supreme Court regarding whom the justices must allow into their courtroom.\n\nRelatedly, another factor is that the matter is \u201cof a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion.\u201d Each branch of government has the discretion to determine the sort of atmosphere it wants for its public events and to give passes consistent with that discretion. Judges can exercise discretion regarding proper decorum in their courtrooms and can eject disruptive occupants from the courtroom, just as the House and Senate have discretion regarding the Capitol building. The president has at least that much discretion regarding his own house.\n\nThe political-question doctrine assumes that there may be instances where a person\u2019s rights are violated, but where federal courts, nonetheless, lack jurisdiction to decide the matter. But in this instance, no one\u2019s rights are violated.\n\nThis is not about the ability of a reporter to cover the president. Acosta can do that from outside of the White House. Nor is it about banning a media outlet. CNN has reportedly approximately 50 employees with White House passes, including perhaps a half-dozen reporters or more.\n\nThis is, instead, Acosta\u2019s demand to enter the house of the President of the United States to argue with him on national television and refusal to relinquish a government microphone when told to do so. It is also about CNN\u2019s demand that as a corporation it has the right to send in one particular antagonist to confront the president to his face, when it has multiple reporters it could send in Acosta\u2019s place.\n\nBecause the D.C. Circuit never ruled on the jurisdictional question, Judge Kelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia should be free to dismiss this case on political-question grounds. If not, then after an appeal to the D.C. Circuit, the Supreme Court should dismiss this case under that doctrine.\n\nBut even if the district court allows the suit to proceed, President Trump and the White House should win on the merits.\n\nNo constitutional rights are absolute, including free speech. The First Amendment does not give you the right to falsely shout \u201cFire!\u201d in a crowded theatre or to lie under oath in a courtroom or to impersonate a police officer or to engage in defamation or fraud. Those are all forms of speech, but they are not protected speech.\n\nThis is not discriminating on the basis of a speaker\u2019s content or viewpoint. Instead, it is content-neutral regulation on the time, place, and manner of speech. It is an assertion that a reporter does not have the right to argue with the president (1) in the White House, (2) during a televised event, (3) with a grossly disrespectful tone, and (4) to physically resist a young female staffer who attempts to reclaim the government property in the reporter\u2019s hand.\n\nSuch content-neutral speech regulations are subject to \u201cintermediate scrutiny,\u201d under which the First Amendment allows the government\u2019s action as long as it is significantly related to an important (if not compelling) public interest. That standard is satisfied here.\n\nCNN and Acosta are also asserting a violation of the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, claiming they have a constitutional right to advance notice of what the White House would do and a written explanation of why the White House did it.\n\nNo, they do not. The Due Process Clause asserts that no person shall be deprived of \u201clife, liberty, or property without due process of law.\u201d They have no \u201cright\u201d to enter the White House to harass the president. An explanation is always nice to have, but it is not constitutionally required here.\n\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 final lawsuit count is under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). That, too, should fail. This is a purely discretionary decision on the part of the White House. It should not be subject to APA review in court. It is also not \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d under the APA. The White House made clear what sort of reasonable, objective standard Acosta\u2019s conduct violated. Finally, because the White House is not violating the First or Fifth Amendments, its action is not \u201ccontrary to law.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Secret Service is not actually making a policy determination here. It, instead, merely executes the ministerial duty of dispensing passes when the applicant poses no security threat to the president. These other considerations relevant to this situation are White House determinations, not Secret Service.\n\nFor all those reasons, the government did not violate the APA.\n\nThis is an interesting lawsuit to legal academics, and it is politically intriguing, but it should not be a close case in the courtroom. The actions of President Trump, his White House, and the U.S. Secret Service are fully consistent with law.\n\nKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

Conte got them to shake hands and smile, even though al-Serraj and Haftar hate each other (AFP)\n\nSeven years after the fall of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Libya now has two governments. In the West, including the capital city Tripoli, Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj leads a weak government known as the Government of National Accord (GNA) internationally recognized by America, Europe, and the United Nations.\n\nMost of the east of Libya is ruled by Khalifa Haftar, a military strongman and former Gaddafi ally considered an international \u201crenegade.\u201d There are fears that a war will break out between the eastern and western factions at some time in the near future.\n\nIt is doubtful that most Europeans care deeply who is in charge of Libya, but one thing that they do care deeply about is the flow of migrants from Libya to Europe. For that reason, the Europeans want to see a single government in Libya and one with which it can negotiate to keep the migrant flow under control.\n\nLibya\u2019s former colonial power Italy hosted a conference in Palermo on Tuesday to bring all interested parties together, with the objective of having an election for the leader of a unified government.\n\nThe conference was hosted by Italy\u2019s prime minister Giuseppe Conte. About 20 countries are participating in the conference, including representatives from the U.S., European governments and Arab countries. Top names in attendance include Egypt\u2019s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, Russia\u2019s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, European Council President Donald Tusk, and EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini.\n\nThe conference did not accomplish much, but there was a lot of drama.\n\nOriginally, Haftar refused to say whether he would even come to Palermo. Then Haftar did arrive, but on Tuesday said that he would not attend the conference, choosing instead to \u201chold a series of meetings with presidents of regional countries to discuss the latest national and international developments\u201d on the sidelines.\n\nSo then Haftar attended a meeting on the sidelines of the conference also attended by Fayez al-Serraj as well as leaders of France, Russia, and Italy.\n\nHowever, Turkey was not invited to that particular meeting. Turkey\u2019s vice president Fuat Oktay stormed out of the international conference, blaming Conte for \u201cattempts to keep Turkey out of the process\u201d in Libya.\n\nAt the end of the conference, there was no statement issued. But the parties agreed that an election previously scheduled for December would not be held, but would be postponed to May of next year. Many people considered the conference a great success simply because Fayez al-Serraj and Khalifa Haftar smiled and shook hands. Deutsche Welle and Hurriyet Daily News (Turkey) and Middle East Eye and Reuters\n\nSplit in Libya reflects the fault line in the Arab world\n\nOne reason that the split between east and west Libya has not been resolved is their supporters are split along the same growing fault line that became apparent several years ago.\n\nTurkey, Qatar, and Italy all support the western GNA government of Fayez al-Serraj and are supportive of Islamists, including the Muslim Brotherhood. Russia, France, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) support Haftar, who is an anti-Islamist military man.\n\nThis split in the Arab world has been growing in recent years. Recall that in June of last year, several Arab states \u2013 including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and United Arab Emirates (UAE) \u2013 broke relations with Qatar and imposed an air, sea and land blockade on Qatar. The blockade is still in place with no end in sight, despite international attempts to resolve it.\n\nMore recently, the assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, apparently by a Saudi hit squad, became an international incident, adding more tensions between Saudi Arabia versus Turkey and Qatar.\n\nThis deepening split among the Arab and Mideast nations makes it all the more unlikely that agreement will be reached on a unified government in Libya.\n\nThe situation is complicated still further by signs that Russia is deepening its military involvement in Libya, sending in Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cprivate\u201d military companies (PMCs) as he has done in Syria and Central African Republic. (See \u201c7-Nov-18 World View \u2014 Suspicions grow about Russia\u2019s Wagner PMC mercenary group in Central African Republic\u201d)\n\nPutin has taken an interest in Libya at least since the overthrow of Gaddafi in 2011 and has actively supported Khalifa Haftar. There have already been military clashes between Haftar\u2019s forces and militias around Tripoli in the West, and the involvement of Russia makes Syrian war situation more likely than an election.

She said the remaining weeks of 2018 are \u201cthe busiest time of the year for the East Wing.\u201d\n\nThe announcement continues the Trump administration\u2019s unprecedented distance from the arts and science communities. No arts or humanities medals have been announced or handed out since September 2016, when Barack Obama was president \u2014 the longest gap by months since the awards were established in the mid-1980s. No science medals have been given since May 2016.\n\nA former head of the National Endowment for the Arts, which oversees the nominating process for the arts medal, said he was dismayed.\n\n\u201cThe current administration\u2019s disregard for culture and scholarship, as well as presidential tradition, is an embarrassment,\u201d Dana Gioia, chairman of the NEA from 2003 to 2009, told the AP.\n\nOther presidents, including Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, have missed Kennedy Center ceremonies. Trump is the first to miss them twice. Grisham cited scheduling conflicts: Trump is expected to attend the G20 summit in Argentina at the end of the month. Had he gone to the Kennedy Center, it\u2019s unlikely he would have been warmly welcomed by at least some of the honorees, who include Cher and \u201cHamilton\u201d playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda, both sharp critics of the president.\n\nLast year, honoree Norman Lear said he would boycott the event if Trump was there. The White House then announced the president and first lady would not be going \u201cto allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction.\u201d\n\nThe absence of arts and science medals isn\u2019t because nominees haven\u2019t been submitted to the White House. According to emails obtained by the AP through the Freedom of Information Act, the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities have continued to duly solicit candidates for the medals and compile proposed winners. The White House traditionally approves and announces them, and the president presides over a ceremony shortly afterward.\n\nRecipients of medals in 2016 included Mel Brooks, Motown founder Berry Gordy and composer Philip Glass, one of this year\u2019s Kennedy Center honorees.", "Progressive Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) said Tuesday the time has come to begin laying the groundwork to vote on a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d bill as Democrats stand poised to lead the House in January.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be pushing for it to get a hearing\u2026.to have this debate on the floor,\u201d Jayapal told National Nurses United union members during a conference call.

The Mogg wants a hard Brexit \u2014 which is to say Brexit \u2014 as much of any of the rest of us do.\n\nHere\u2019s what he said:\n\nThere are lots of leaks and rumours and stories that come out. It\u2019s very easy to get wound up about an individual story that comes true which then turns out to be untrue. The danger of getting wound up by each individual story is that you make a great song and dance about how you don\u2019t want this, you don\u2019t want that. Then the government comes along and says, \u201cThat\u2019s fine, we\u2019re not doing that. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s all absolutely fine.\u201d Then in the detail you discover that is something much worse, but you\u2019ve used all your credibility up in opposing something that was never going to happen in the first place. Then you\u2019ve got none left with which to oppose what really matters. We have to wait and see what comes out of negotiations. Then, look, it may be brilliant. It may be a super idea. It may be an approach to Brexit that we can all get behind and then that\u2019s terrific, or it may not be. Once we know, we can make intelligent and coherent criticisms, and we can work out what the parliamentary numbers are.\n\n(For the dunces at the back, when Rees-Mogg says \u201cit may be a super idea\u201d, this is the elegant piss-taking in which he specialises.)\n\nThe bottom line as far as Rees-Mogg and the rest of the European Research Group are concerned is this: when the gift-wrapped turd gets put to the parliamentary vote, it\u2019s going to get flushed down the loo, as it deserves.\n\nIn other words, we are heading for a No Deal \u2014 on World Trade Organization terms.\n\nThe third reason is, even though I do not claim to be Nostradamus, I do have an absolutely superb track record when it comes to predictions which have to do with Theresa May.\n\nRemember two years ago when she was in the running for Prime Minister and vast swathes of the Tory press, led by Her Majesty\u2019s Daily Mail, were desperately trying to whip up public enthusiasm \u2014 like a hapless fluffer on a porn movie set after the fifth money shot retake \u2014 by making out that she was going to be the new Margaret Thatcher?\n\nWell here was the headline I wrote: Better a Cocker Spaniel as Prime Minister than Theresa Ruddy May!\n\nWas I right?

He is widely expected to direct border officials to freeze the border policy, by imposing a nationwide Temporary Restraining Order.\n\nThe pro-migration groups include the ACLU.

Matt Gaetz (R-FL) told Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow that Democrats are \u201cstress-testing the integrity of our election system\u201d to build a \u201croad-map on how to steal the election from Donald Trump in 2020,\u201d offering his remarks on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Daily.\n\nGaetz discussed ostensible vote recount efforts in Florida: \u201cThe law requires certain reporting and transparency to occur regarding who voted, when they voted, and by what means they voted. That transparency isn\u2019t just to make us feel better, it\u2019s the kryptonite to fraud, because if we know how people are voting you\u2019re able to triangulate against any of the fraudsters that would cast the illegal ballots.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\n\nGatez remarked, \u201cBrenda Snipes has just decided there are certain things she\u2019s not going to tell us and wasn\u2019t going to tell us. So we had to go to court, and the courts ruled that the supervisor of elections violated the Florida Constitution by standing in the way of public access. What\u2019s most concerning is that between election day and now, over 80,000 ballots have just been like spoken into existence. They weren\u2019t acknowledged to even exist on election night, and then lo and behold, the Democrats needed more votes to close gaps, and more ballots continued to be found.\n\nGaetz joked, \u201cHell, I still think they\u2019re finding votes of Al Gore down in Broward County.\u201d\n\nGaetz stated, \u201cIn a lot of our Republican counties, we play it by the books. Our supervisors of elections don\u2019t cut corners. They follow the law. So in a recount, you often don\u2019t get a whole lot of new votes from Republican areas. It\u2019s in the Democrat areas where all of a sudden there are mystery boxes of ballots and votes that are counted.\u201d\n\nGaetz said Democrats are building a \u201croad map\u201d to \u201csteal\u201d 2020\u2019s president election.\n\n\u201cWhat should concern all Americans is that we\u2019ve got like 80,000 ballots that have no chain of custody, no real record of how they were voted or where they came from, and my concern is, while I think Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott are outside the margin of fraud, if the Democrats are able to learn now what techniques work and don\u2019t work, what transparency laws are going to be followed and which ones aren\u2019t, then it gives them a road-map on how to steal the election from Donald Trump in 2020,\u201d warned Gaetz. \u201cI really think that\u2019s what this is about. The resistance movement has changed from yelling at town halls and yelling in restaurants to now, potentially, trying to steal elections that they can\u2019t win at the ballot box.\u201d\n\nGaetz added, \u201cDonald Trump has proven what the winning coalition is. He\u2019s going to knock down about 90 percent of the Republican vote, and then he\u2019s going to really drive up turnout among independents and some Democrats in areas where he\u2019s popular. \u2026 If they\u2019re able to slice down our margins in the high turnout Republican areas, it really collapses the Trump coalition.\u201d\n\nGaetz continued, \u201cI think what they\u2019re doing is testing what they can get away with. \u2026 My concern is that those tactics are being developed. \u2026 The Democratic Party in Florida is already doing training to perfect ballots, and they put out the number that [they need], three ballots per precinct, to beat Rick Scott. The goal here is not to count every vote [or] make sure everyone\u2019s voice is heard. The goal for the Democrats is to win the election. So they are training their operatives how to interpret a stray mark, or an x, or a bubble, so that they can flip votes after the election\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nGaetz concluded, \u201cThis is about stress-testing the integrity of our election system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe new conservative movement has to take on Trump\u2019s sense of boldness,\u201d advised Gaetz. \u201cIf we allow Democrats to continue this behavior, they\u2019re not going to get better [or] treat us better or follow the rules more.

(\u201cStep right up: The recount circus has come back to Florida,\u201d NBC News groaned on Monday.)\n\nThere is much apprehension among Republican voters because Democrats always seem to do incredibly well in these recount dramas, deploying strike teams of lawyers to obtain the most favorable possible interpretation of dubious ballots and harvesting a bumper crop of dubious ballots to interpret. Mysterious boxes of votes discovered after Election Day always seem to favor the Democrats by lopsided margins.\n\nHere are some of the most famous recount shenanigans from times gone by:\n\n1. Hanging Chads and Ballot Seances: The indelible image of the Florida recount was election officials staring at questionable punch-card ballots and attempting to \u201cdiscern the intent\u201d of the voters. The idea was that voters who didn\u2019t properly punch out a vote for president must have been the victims of stubborn paper, malfunctioning punch machines, or confusing instructions.\n\n\u201cChad,\u201d the term for the little square of paper poked out of ballot slips under punch card systems, entered mainstream American discourse in numerous permutations: there were hanging chads, dimpled chads, pregnant chads, and more. Different jurisdictions had different rules for counting and discarding questionable votes.\n\nThe savage legal battle over whether unclear ballots should be studied by election-board swamis until the intent of the voter could be divined raged all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which finally stopped the Florida recount on December 12, 2000.\n\n2. Disqualified absentee ballots: The 2000 election in Florida was marked by complaints from absentee voters that their votes were suppressed by incorrectly marking them as received too late to be counted. Many of these absentee voters were deployed military personnel who tend to vote Republican, leading to suspicions that partisan election officials were deliberately suppressing the ballots to help Gore. These suspicions were made deeper when a memo by Gore\u2019s legal team with instructions on how to challenge overseas absentee ballots, including military votes, was discovered by Republicans.\n\nA former deployed military voter named Dave Lowry wrote an account in the Washington Examiner on Sunday of how his 2000 vote for George W. Bush was improperly suppressed. In 2004, Lowry provided documentary evidence his absentee ballot was incorrectly suppressed to Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes, who is now a pivotal figure in the 2018 recount. \u201cBrenda Snipes never responded to the letter. To date, my ballot has never been opened or counted,\u201d Lowry reported.\n\n3. Franken vs. Coleman 2008: The Miami Herald noted on Monday that only 26 recounts have been held in the United States since the 2000 election, and only three of them changed the outcome of the race. The most famous of those was the Minnesota Senate race in 2008 between Democrat Al Franken and Republican Norm Coleman.\n\nColeman, the incumbent, initially won re-election by a mere 725 votes out of 2.9 million cast in the election. His lead shrank to 221 because a wave of \u201ccorrections\u201d submitted by local officials almost all favored Franken.\n\nThe ensuing hand recount included a large number of duplicate ballots that were created to replace damaged ballots but were not properly marked as duplicates. State laws were waived in some cases to allow dubious ballots, but not in other cases, generally using whichever approach favored Franken. Improperly marked ballots were interpreted using inconsistent rules that favored Franken. Rejected absentee ballots were improperly included. Complaints were later made that some 400 felons voted illegally. Some voters clearly were not interested in carefully following the instructions, producing ballots that might be rejected by machines or some human vote counters but accepted by others.\n\n4. Rossi vs. Gregoire: The other two races since 2000 where recounts changed the outcome include the 2006 contest for Vermont state auditor and the 2004 Washington governor\u2019s race. In the latter instance, Republican Dino Rossi originally won by 261 votes out of 3 million cast. Numerous recounts were held, producing different results, and several lawsuits were filed.\n\nIn the end, Democrat Christine Gregoire was pronounced the winner by just 130 votes. The bitter battle over the outcome dragged on for two months and cost millions of dollars, with both sides accusing each other of improper behavior, with Democrats denouncing Rossi as a \u201cthief\u201d at one point, while Rossi said the recount was not \u201cclean\u201d and one of his spokespeople called it a \u201ctotal sham.\u201d\n\nAs with the Minnesota 2008 recount and the Florida 2000 debacle, complaints from both sides centered on different methods employed to count and reject ballots in different counties.\n\n5. The never-ending battle over sloppy voter rolls: In a taste of things to come after their stunning 2016 defeat, Democrats worked tirelessly to delegitimize President George W. Bush\u2019s 2000 election victory, focusing obsessively on the photo finish in Florida. The Commission on Civil Rights fueled years of left-wing conspiracy theories by publishing a report in 2001 that accused Florida state government under Governor Jeb Bush, the new president\u2019s brother, of \u201coverzealous\u201d efforts to purge ineligible voters from the roles. These efforts were said to have disproportionately and unfairly impacted black voters, who are far more likely to vote Democratic.\n\nThe report was criticized as tainted by Democrat partisanship and distorted by some unwarranted assumptions about the process of purging ineligible voters, but arguments over voter rolls persist to this day, and they figure heavily in recount dramas because voter registration data is vital to the debate. Left-wing groups invariably portray even the most carefully-administered registration cleanup efforts as nefarious conspiracies to suppress the Democrat vote. Voter registration controversies have raged through Florida several times, including the same Broward County that is ground zero for the 2018 recount drama, involving some of the same election officials. Ohio was the scene of another recent high-profile purge of voter registrations.", "According to the exit polls, the biggest issue in the 2018 elections was health care. A full 40 percent of Americans identified health care as their prime concern; by contrast, the second-ranking issue, immigration, lagged 17 points behind. Indeed, a nationwide map of political advertising this year showed that health care was the hottest topic.\n\nMoreover, if we examine the very specific choices on healthcare policy made by the voters in a half-dozen states, we can see even better the power of the issue. In four states, the expansion of Medicaid, yea or nay, was on the ballot, and in three of those states\u2014Idaho, Nebraska, and Utah\u2014the ayes had it. (Montana voted no.) In addition, in two other states, Kansas and Maine, the voters replaced Republican governors who had opposed Medicaid expansion with Democratic governors who support it.\n\nInterestingly, this idea of Medicaid expansion traces back to the Affordable Care Act of 2010, also known as Obamacare. Under the law\u2019s provisions, every state had the option of expanding Medicaid, with the federal government chipping in 90 percent of the cost. Prior to Tuesday, 32 states had chosen to accept this incremental Medicaid funding, while 18 had not. (Not surprisingly, the big blue states long ago got on the Obamacare-Medicaid train, while the non-expansion states were almost all red.) Yet now, in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s voting, the number of non-expansion states has shrunk from 18 to 13.\n\nWe might pause to note that the topic here is Medicaid expansion, not Medicaid itself. Medicaid for the poor has been a law since the 1960s, and it\u2019s not going anywhere. Instead, the issue, these days, is whether or not to expand the program upwards, to include the working poor\u2014that is, folks with jobs who are just scraping along. Obamacare gave states the option of expanding Medicaid eligibility to families with income up to 138 percent of the poverty line\u2014which is to say, those on the lower economic end of the middle class.\n\nSo we can see: Obamacare was never really about the poor, because they were already covered. Instead, the intended beneficiaries were the working class. And these days, when Republican politicos are increasingly interested in winning over blue-collar and service workers\u2014including those wary TIGRs\u2013the idea of extending coverage to them shouldn\u2019t be regarded as a crazy idea.\n\nOf course, Obamacare itself can always use a good reforming. After all, there were plenty of hot-button issues entwined in that legislation, including top-down control and exotic social-engineering. And yet the issue of Medicaid expansion, as a subset of Obamacare, is relatively straight-forward. Uncle Sam is either helping working stiffs with their medical issues, or he\u2019s not.\n\nWe can quickly see that quite a few Trump voters are included in this category; yes, these are the new Republicans, and this is the new Republican Party. So it\u2019s revealing that Medicaid expansion passed in Idaho\u2014arguably the most Republican state in the country\u2014with more than 60 percent of the vote.\n\nStill, plenty of Republicans are staunchly opposed to any expansion of Medicaid, just as they might wish to be rid of all social-welfare programs.\n\nEverybody\u2019s entitled to his or her own beliefs, of course, but as the recent election results show, opponents of a social safety net are increasingly having to argue with their fellow Republicans.\n\nYes, we are having, yet again, a big debate over healthcare coverage\u2014in both parties. The Democrats, of course, have always been mostly on board with Obamacare; the controversy for them, now, is the idea of Medicare For All.\n\nAs for Republicans, few GOPers have anything nice to say about \u201cObamacare,\u201d but especially lately, they have had plenty of nice things to say about guaranteeing coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. In fact, these days, it\u2019s hard to find a Republican who doesn\u2019t want to guarantee such coverage. And yet as many libertarian purists have griped, such a coverage guarantee is, in effect, a cave-in to Obamacare.\n\nYes, Republicans have some hard thinking to do on health insurance; after all, last year, at the peak of the repeal-Obamacare push, a full 81 percent of Americans opposed the GOP effort.\n\nAs for 2018, the reader might ask: Did it seem as though the GOP had a strong and steady party-wide message on Obamacare this year? A plausible pitch on \u201crepeal and replace\u201d? Or on anything related to health care? Or did Republicans mostly wish to mumble and change the subject?\n\nWell, as the polls\u2014and the House election results\u2014suggest, mumbling around isn\u2019t such a good option anymore.\n\nFor their part, the Democrats are obviously convinced that they have momentum on health care. Yes, that\u2019s a big change from 2010, or even 2014, but then, a lot has changed in the last few years. In terms of healthcare advocacy, the Democrats did, indeed, get clobbered in the 2010 and 2014 midterms, and yet they stuck with their program, and now, finally, it\u2019s picking up in popularity. (Although Democrats have a point when they argue that national health insurance has, in fact, been mostly popular going back as far as 1945.)\n\nSo today, the donkeys are stampeding. One report this year found that 61 percent of pro-Democratic ads in U.S. House races focused on health care. Or as The New York Times wrote in the wake of the elections, Democrats \u201cdelivered a message about healthcare with the repetitive force of a jackhammer.\u201d\n\nStill, people don\u2019t necessarily trust the Democrats on health care. It\u2019s interesting, for example, that the polls on Obamacare still show some ambivalence about the program: According to the Fox/AP/NORC exit poll, 51 percent of Americans want to repeal Obamacare, either wholly, or, just \u201cparts\u201d of it. By contrast, 47 percent wish to leave Obamacare as is, or expand it.\n\nThus we can see, such close numbers offer encouragement to anti-Obamacare Republicans, even now. Yet as the GOP discovered over the past two years as it slogged and quagmired World War One-style on Obamacare repeal, the devil is in the details. For instance, what does repealing \u201cparts\u201d of Obamacare actually mean? Which \u201cparts\u201d? Republican attacks over the last decade might have made the name of Obamacare unpopular, but the idea of getting everyone covered is a far different story.\n\nTo illustrate, we might consider another question asked in the same exit poll: \u201cDo you think the federal government has a responsibility for healthcare?\u201d On that question, 58 percent of Americans said yes, and only 41 percent said no. If we pause over those numbers, including the 17-point spread between \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno,\u201d we start to see why the Democrats are feelin\u2019 groovy.\n\nMoreover, a Reuters/Ipsos poll from August found that a whopping 70 percent of Americans\u2014including 52 percent of Republicans\u2014support Medicare For All.\n\nYet as we look at these numbers, we must emphasize, once again, that the devil\u2014or at least a demon or two\u2014is lurking in those details. For instance, while the Medicare program for senior citizens is enormously popular, it is not necessarily the same thing as Medicare For All, as advocated by, most famously, Bernie Sanders. While Sanders and his comrades have been notoriously vague about the precise details of what they\u2019re in favor of, it seems that most advocates are looking to create a Canadian-type healthcare system\u2014that is, socialized medicine, heavy on centralized bureaucrats and lefty agendas, including abortion and sex-change operations.\n\nSo if Republicans wish to offer an alternative, they should start offering it. If they wish to be part of the debate, then it seems that it\u2019s necessary, first, to acknowledge the worthiness of the goal\u2014that everyone gets covered. As we have seen, that\u2019s what the American people support, and, after all, it\u2019s their country.\n\nThe Republican opportunity, then, is to argue the healthcare issue in a conservative way by endorsing market forces while nixing lefty nuttiness. Just about every conservative policy maven thinks he or she has such a plan already; the challenge is to link it to the growing support for coverage and then sell it to the country.\n\nIn fact, all through modern history, parties on the right have often been the pioneers of no-nonsense social insurance. Indeed, the very first such system was created, back in the 19th century, by Germany\u2019s Otto von Bismarck. As his nickname, \u201cIron Chancellor,\u201d might suggest, Bismarck was no liberal; he simply figured that the maintenance of a conservative public order and robust national morale required some conscious effort by the national government. To put it another way, there\u2019s strength to be found in unity, and yet unity requires mutuality. If a leader wants his people to care about the well-being of the country, then the country has to care about the well-being of the people. Isn\u2019t that what nationalism is all about?\n\nAdmittedly, this is not a libertarian argument, but it surely is a conservative argument. That\u2019s why top leaders on the right\u2014from Winston Churchill to Charles DeGaulle to Richard Nixon to Margaret Thatcher\u2014have all supported the idea, at least, of national health insurance.\n\nThe goal of getting everyone covered does not have to mean a hulking bureaucratic colossus. It simply means making sure that everyone is covered.\n\nIs that really that hard? Isn\u2019t it the essence of strong nationalism to say, We take care of our own?", "Hans von Spakovsky, senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation and manager of its Election Law Reform Initiative, told Breitbart News that Broward County\u2019s elections supervisor Brenda Snipes is known as Florida\u2019s \u201cmost incompetent election official,\u201d offering his remarks in a Monday interview on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.\n\nVon Spakovsky said, \u201cIf you talk to election officials in Florida, they\u2019ll tell you that Brenda Snipes is known as the most incompetent election official in the state, and she just blithely acts as if she doesn\u2019t know any of that.

After breakfast in a canteen, he says they were led to classrooms, where teachers taught detainees words in Pinyin, China\u2019s Romanized writing system, alongside their Chinese-character equivalents. They were also given books about Lei Feng, a Chinese soldier regarded as a model of selfless devotion to communism, and were periodically quizzed by teachers on their knowledge of the \u201c126 lies\u201d about religion. Instead of re-educating him, he says his experience at the camp \u201cmade me hate the government even more.\u201d\n\nThe former prisoner also revealed Chinese authorities forced him to stand for hours while wearing \u201ciron clothes\u201d to break his spirit.\n\n\u201cThey made me wear what they called \u2018iron clothes,\u2019 a suit made of metal that weighed over 50 pounds,\u201d Samarkand told NPR. \u201cIt forced my arms and legs into an outstretched position. I couldn\u2019t move at all, and my back was in terrible pain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey made people wear this thing to break their spirits. After 12 hours, I became so soft, quiet and lawful,\u201d he added.\n\nSamarkand said he was finally allowed to leave the camp and return to Kazakhstan \u201cafter he attempted to kill himself by banging his head as hard as he could against a wall, which only managed to knock him out.\u201d\n\nAccording to U.S. government and independent assessments, Bejing has forced hundreds of thousands of ethnic Uighurs (or Uyghurs), Kazakhs, and other minorities into the camps, where Chinese authorities are committing human rights abuses.\n\nUighurs are facing \u201csystemic torture,\u201d disappearances, executions, and arbitrary detentions as part of Beijing\u2019s \u201cre-education campaign\u201d ostensibly to combat alleged extremism and separatism, the U.S. State Department determined, noting that President Xi\u2019s efforts against the Muslim minority \u201cintensified\u201d last year.\n\nBeijing has defended its crackdown, claiming that the concentration camps are vocational centers focused on purging separatist and religious extremist elements from Uighur-majority Xinjiang.\n\nOn Tuesday, State Councillor Wang Yi, communist China\u2019s top diplomat, dismissed Bejing\u2019s human rights abuses at the re-education centers as \u201cgossip,\u201d urging the international community to ignore and trust authorities there, Channel News Asia reports.\n\nXinjiang, China\u2019s largest province, borders various countries including Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India.\n\nMarking one of the first public criticisms from a predominantly Muslim country of Beijing\u2019s policy in Xinjiang, China\u2019s top ally Pakistan urged the Asian giant to take steps against the human rights abuses and repression of ethnic Muslim Uighurs in the province.\n\nReferring to the internment camps, the Nation from Pakistan reported in September, \u201cThis includes programs that focus on psychological indoctrination.

The term \u2018voter suppression,\u2019 which you constantly hear now, that is a myth.\u201d\n\n\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\u201cThat is something that has been created by the left,\u201d added von Spakovsky. \u201cWhy? In order to prevent any kind of reform measures that would fix the vulnerabilities in our system and cause us to clean up the voter rolls; to take off the felons and the non-citizens, for example, who are on the rolls in Broward County.\u201d\n\nVon Spakovsky continued, \u201cThese claims of voter suppression are intentional, and it\u2019s a way of preventing improvements in the system, because they believe, for example, they don\u2019t want verification of citizenship because every non-citizen that registers and votes, they think is a vote for them. So they want them to be able to do that, to get away with it, and to not get caught.\u201d\n\nMansour addressed Democrats\u2019 opposition to electoral reform measures to verify citizenship of voters, saying, \u201cIt always seems as if every effort to make it as ridiculously easy \u2014 almost fraudulently easy \u2014 to vote is always being pushed by the Democrats. \u2026 It opens itself up to abuse or potential fraud.\u201d\n\nMansour added, \u201cIt\u2019s so simple to actually register to vote [and] do it on a deadline. You have to pay your taxes on a deadline. Why can\u2019t you register to vote on a deadline? Apparently that\u2019s too hard for people. It wasn\u2019t too hard for past generations.\u201d\n\nVon Spakovsky remarked, \u201cThe lawyer that\u2019s been hired by the Democrats down there \u2026 is Mark Elias, [who] was the lawyer who represented Al Franken and who was able to turn around a 2008 Minnesota election.\u201d\n\nVon Spakovsky went on, \u201cThey need observers in there watching the decision-making on all of the provisional ballots to ensure that provisional ballots are only going to be counted for people who are actual eligible voters, because what Elias and his people will be doing in Democratic strongholds is pushing so that every provisional ballot is counted without consideration of whether the person is actually eligible.\n\nVon Spakovsky added, \u201cThey\u2019re also going to be pushing for all absentee ballots to be counted, even if the ballots don\u2019t actually comply with state law, [such as] ballots missing information like a signature. In Democratic strongholds, they want every vote counted even if there\u2019s something wrong with the ballot.\u201d\n\nVon Spakovsky addressed Broward Count elections supervisor Brenda Snipes\u2019s claims of \u201cfinding\u201d uncounted ballots, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no chain of custody. If this was out of the custody of election officials. If this was, for example, left in a school someplace unattended, those votes should not be counted, because there\u2019s no telling what happened to them while no one was watching them. \u2026 We saw Democrat lawyers do this in 2008 in Minnesota.\u201d\n\nDemocrat lawyers are confident they can overturn the results of close elections through litigation, assessed Von Spakovsky, saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s happened since that 2000 election is that the lawyers who are the attorneys for the Democratic Party and Democratic candidates have, in essence, taken over and said, \u2018In any kind of close election, we think through litigation we can litigate you into a win. So don\u2019t concede, no matter what.\u2019 That in essence, their attitude.\u201d\n\nVon Spakovsky added, \u201cThey want non-citizens voting despite the fact that they know it\u2019s illegal under state and federal law because they know it will help them win elections, and that\u2019s why they have fought in the courts to stop states from verifying the citizenship of voters. Democrats have spent a lot of money to prevent that from happening.\u201d\n\nPollak noted how lawyers for Andrew Gillum and Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL), on Friday, objected to the rejection of a provisional ballot cast by a non-citizen.\n\nVon Spakovsky concluded, \u201cThe elections in Florida, Arizona, and elsewhere show you that when we have close elections, every little bit of fraud, every little bit of bad election officials who don\u2019t clean up their voters rolls and do things like take non-citizens off the rolls, could make the difference in who wins.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.", "(AP) \u2014 Authorities say destruction from Southern California\u2019s huge wildfire will be significantly higher than the 435 structures already counted as destroyed.\n\nLos Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said at a press conference Tuesday that authorities are assessing damage from the 150-square-mile Woolsey Fire.

But average birth rate and family size in Central America are roughly twice as large as in the United States, so the migration of 5 million could lead to the birth of at least 5 million additional people after the migrants get jobs in the United States.\n\nThe estimate was posted by Gallup as President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers try to fend off lawsuits against his November plan to curb the growing use of asylum claims by economic migrants from Central America, including the migrants who are part of the caravans heading to the U.S. border.\n\nOn Tuesday, the ACLU and other elite groups who favor cheap-labor migration are asking a California judge to block Trump\u2019s asylum-reform, anti-caravan plan.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers are expected to say his plan complies with Congress\u2019 law by offering caravans of migrants full access to asylum courts if they apply at the border\u2019s \u201cports of entry,\u201d while also offering a limited form of asylum, dubbed \u201cwithholding from removal,\u201d to migrants who illegally sneak into the United States.\n\nIf upheld, Trump\u2019s \u201cwithholding of removal\u201d fix would be a huge blow to the cartels\u2019 labor trafficking business.

Expect outrage from cheap-labor/pro-migration industry. Caravan heading to 9th circuit. https://t.co/gU14OOQEfC \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) November 9, 2018\n\nGallup reported:\n\nIn Gallup\u2019s most recent global estimate, between 2015 and 2017, 15% of the world\u2019s adults \u2014 more than 750 million people \u2014 said they would like to move to another country permanently if they could. In Central America, this percentage is one in three (33%), or about 10 million adults. Three percent of the world\u2019s adults \u2014 or nearly 160 million people \u2014 say they would like to move to the U.S. This includes 16% of adults from Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Panama and Costa Rica, which translates into nearly 5 million people. \u2026 For example, in Honduras, whose residents make up a large percentage of the migrant caravan, about half of adults (47%) say they would like to move to another country permanently if they could, but about 9% are planning to move in the next year \u2014 and 2% are actively preparing to do so.\n\nMexico\u2019s labor-trafficking cartels are expanding their business by offering to move people from Indian and African through their smuggling networks into U.S. jobs via the backlogged U.S. asylum system.\n\nMigration is encouraged and welcomed by many Democratic legislators who rationally expect the government-dependent migrants to back their political party once the migrants are naturalized.\n\nMany business-first Republicans support migration because it provides Wall Street investors and companies with a growing number of workers and consumers. Poor migrants and children are good for companies and investors because taxpayers are forced to spend more money on aid and welfare payments. That extra welfare spending becomes an indirect taxpayer subsidy for the many grocery stores, used-car dealers, teachers, landlords and other people who help or trade with migrants and their children.\n\nWealthy and influential Americans gain cheap labor from low-wage migration. They also gain stock market wealth, political influence amid the chaotic diversity, plus satisfaction from aiding distant foreigners instead of local Americans.\n\nThe tacit alliance of progressives and investors, Democrats and Republicans, has largely blockedPresidentt Donald Trump\u2019s effort to help ordinary Americans by curbing migration into U.S. workplaces and neighborhoods.\n\nWashington\u2019s economic policy of using migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe policy also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids\u2019 schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.\n\nImmigration also pulls investment and wealth away from heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations living in the coastal states.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The headline of this article has been updated to reflect that Gallup\u2019s survey did not ask respondents whether they plan to migrate illegally or in a migrant caravan.

He conceded that \u201cit\u2019s much too early to tell\u201d whether he has a legitimate chance of winning the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 and, with it, the chance to take on another New York billionaire, President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThanksgiving, Christmas and then maybe a few weeks into January \u2014 that\u2019s when you really gotta sit down, talk to your advisers and say, \u2018Look, do I have a chance?\u2019 I think I know why I would want to run. I think I know what I think this country should do and what I would do. But I just don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s possible,\u201d Bloomberg told the AP.\n\nHe added, \u201cIf people don\u2019t seem to be warming to you, there\u2019s plenty of other ways that I can make a difference in life and say thank you to this country for what it\u2019s given my kids and me.\u201d\n\nShould he run, Bloomberg would bring virtually limitless resources and a pragmatic governing approach to what is expected to be a massive 2020 Democratic field. Hardly a far-left liberal, he is described by his team as socially progressive and business-minded. He has spent tens of millions of dollars to promote liberal priorities on climate change, gun control and immigration.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear, however, whether there\u2019s room for Bloomberg in today\u2019s Democratic Party.\n\nTom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, offered a lukewarm assessment this week when asked about Bloomberg\u2019s $110 million investment in his party\u2019s 2018 midterm efforts.\n\n\u201cI applaud everybody who was involved,\u201d Perez said in an interview. \u201cVery appreciative of Mayor Bloomberg. Equally appreciative of those grassroots activists who were knocking on doors every weekend, texting people, investing 50 bucks in the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nStill, Bloomberg endeared himself to many Democratic leaders in recent months after deciding to invest more than $110 million in the 2018 midterms \u2014 largely focused on House races. Long an active political donor to candidates in both parties, Bloomberg gave almost exclusively to Democrats this year for the first time.\n\nThe decision, he explained, was born out of his concern that Republicans who controlled the House and Senate weren\u2019t providing an adequate check on the Trump presidency. Yet this political season marked a permanent shift in his political identity, he said.\n\n\u201cI will be a Democrat for the rest of my life,\u201d Bloomberg said.\n\nInitially registered as a Democrat, the Massachusetts native filed paperwork to change his voter registration to Republican in 2000 before his first run for New York City mayor, according to a spokesman. In June 2007, he unenrolled from the GOP, having no formal party affiliation until he registered again as a Democrat this October.\n\nMonths before that, Bloomberg directed his political team to work hand in hand with leading Democratic allies to shape the first nationwide election of Trump\u2019s presidency.

Bill Nelson\u2019s (D-FL) legal team filed a lawsuit in a federal court this afternoon in a bid to extend the deadline for recounting votes statewide.\n\nThe Hill reports:\n\nUnder Florida law, the state Elections Canvassing Commission must certify election results no later than Nov. 20. The ruling is likely to delay that process, leaving Floridians wondering who their next senator, governor and agriculture commissioner will be. The ruling, reported by The Palm Beach Post, came in a lawsuit filed by Jim Bonfiglio, a Democrat locked in tight contest for a state House seat. That lawsuit asked the judge to extend the deadline for vote reporting in his race against Republican Mike Caruso. \u2026 Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner, a Republican, ordered recounts in the Senate race, as well as the contests for governor and agriculture commissioner, on Saturday.

China and the ASEAN countries have come to a consensus on the South China Sea issue, which is to control hostilities over the divergence and adhere to the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC), Li noted. \u201cCurrently the issue is being influenced by outside factors, such as the US, which sees the South China Sea as a point to balance China\u2019s power.\u201d Li forecasts that during the 21st ASEAN-China Summit on Wednesday, China and the US will show their stances on the South China Sea issue.\n\nPence on Sunday assured reporters President Donald Trump was not snubbing ASEAN and APEC by missing the meetings, the first time America\u2019s president has not attended since President Barack Obama skipped them in 2013.\n\nThe Associated Press nevertheless heard some grumbling about Trump sending Pence in his place:\n\nThe president\u2019s absence leaves Pence to fill a void that\u2019s grown wider under Trump, who\u2019s pulled out of a major Pacific trade deal, slapped tariffs on allies, and intensified a diplomatic and economic battle with China. Pence will need to make significant announcements to overcome growing skepticism about the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to Asia, said Anthony Nelson, director of the East Asia and Pacific practice at the Albright Stonebridge Group in Washington. \u201cThere has been disappointment that President Trump did not commit to coming,\u201d said Nelson, a former director of the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council. \u201cPence can try to say the right things, but without anything concrete that he can offer, it\u2019s hard to think it won\u2019t be overshadowed by what everyone knows the administration is thinking.\u201d Pence has the president\u2019s full backing and plans to announce several new initiatives during his weeklong trip, according to a senior administration official. They include bilateral, trilateral and possibly larger initiatives that cover the digital economy, energy and infrastructure, said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. As the top representative from the world\u2019s largest economy, Pence will have an audience with several world leaders interested in hearing more about U.S. policy. The vice president begins his trip with meetings and a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo on Tuesday. Pence is also scheduled to have meetings with the prime ministers of Singapore, India, Australia and Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe AP observed that while Pence is normally a reassuring and businesslike presence, he has been outspokenly critical of China over the past month. The vice president\u2019s office said he plans to \u201cdeliver the message that authoritarianism, aggression, and the disregard for other nations\u2019 sovereignty by any nation in the Indo-Pacific will not be tolerated by the United States.\u201d\n\nReuters wondered if Pence would have a significant encounter with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang at the ASEAN summit, possibly foreshadowing President Trump\u2019s meeting with Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires later this month.\n\nLi will seek to build support for China\u2019s Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a multilateral free trade deal that would include all of the Asian economic superpowers but not the United States. Reuters also expected Li to push China\u2019s proposal for a South China Sea code of conduct that would ratify Beijing\u2019s expansive territorial claims.\n\nAnother matter of keen interest to ASEAN members will be if Pence discusses U.S. plans to compete with China\u2019s vast Belt and Road infrastructure project. Congress created the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (USIDFC) with a $60 billion budget to compete against China\u2019s \u201cdebt trap\u201d loans to developing nations, as Pence dubbed them in October to China\u2019s great irritation. Southeast Asian nations will be keenly interested to see how much money the U.S. actually puts on the table for infrastructure development and what kind of restrictions come with the money.\n\nPence\u2019s trip to Asia included a Monday meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo. Pence described Japan as an \u201cindispensable trade partner for the United States,\u201d but he said the U.S. \u201chas had a trade imbalance with Japan for too long.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration plans to resolve this issue with what Pence has described as a \u201chistoric\u201d bilateral trade agreement with Japan. Pence also urged the Japanese to invest more in their own defense and received reassurances from Abe that Japan remains fully committed to denuclearizing North Korea.

There are the obvious reasons, not the least of which is her place in the history books as the first female House speaker. But it is more than that. It is how she got there \u2014 excelling in a man\u2019s world and playing in what was traditionally a boy\u2019s club of politics \u2014 as well as, and often better than, her male counterparts. She\u2019s had plenty of detractors and naysayers, even among Democrats. But she is seen as effective, so much so that even her political opponents \u2014 mostly men \u2014 have repeatedly told me over the years that they marvel at her leadership of her caucus.\n\nCNN released a video version of its interview with the 76-year-old featuring slow-motion hero shots and triumphant music. Anchor Dana Bash lets the segment veer into outright hagiography, fawning throughout the narration:\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi certainly knows her power more than any other woman I\u2019ve ever covered in politics, and I\u2019ve always wondered, \u2018How?'\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s as strict about her chocolate as she is standing up for herself.\u201d\n\nPelosi reveals her male Democrat colleagues were empathic to the idea of her running for House leadership nearly two decades ago. \u201cWhen people came to me and said, \u2018You should run for leadership,\u2019 and I agreed to look at it, then some of the men said, \u2018Who said she could run?\u2019 That was a real motivator,\u201d she says.\n\nPelosi appears to blame criticism of her on her being an accomplished female legislator, claiming she receives nearly the same level of flack as a presidential candidate. \u201cI get some names called, because if you\u2019re effective as a woman, then they have to undermine you, because that\u2019s a real threat,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m probably more of a target than anybody, except for somebody who runs for president.\u201d\n\nTouted as the \u201cultimate Republican boogeyman,\u201d Pelosi dismisses talk that she may possess the votes to secure the speakership come January. \u201cI have a broad base of support in the country, financially, politically, and otherwise, which is valuable to our caucus,\u201d she says. \u201cNone of us is indispensable, but some of us are just better at our jobs than others,\u201d she adds matter-of-factly.\n\nHowever, as Breitbart News\u2019 Matt Boyle reported Monday, Pelosi faces an uphill battle locking down the 218 required to regain the House gavel.\n\nWhen all is said and done from last Tuesday\u2019s midterms\u2013there are still nine outstanding House races\u2013Democrats could have a majority as high as 236 seats but definitely will have at least 227. That final number is going to be critical for Democrats\u2019 hopes of securing Pelosi as speaker, as every number extra that Democrats add to the final total is an extra vote Pelosi can afford to lose. If Republicans sweep those nine remaining races, a very unlikely outcome, and Democrats enter the new Congress with 227 votes, Pelosi can only afford to lose nine Democrats on the floor. Democrats, however, are very likely to pick up a number of the nine outstanding seats. They currently lead Republicans in four of them: California\u2019s 10th District, New Jersey\u2019s 3rd District, New York\u2019s 22nd, and Utah\u2019s 4th District. Republicans lead Democrats in the other five: California\u2019s 39th and 45th Districts, and Georgia\u2019s 7th, as well as Maine\u2019s 2nd, and Texas\u2019s 23rd Districts. \u2026 [D]espite Pelosi\u2019s allies pushing the narrative that a challenger to her must emerge, that is not true. They can vote her down, and then most certainly after she would have failed to reach 218 votes on the first ballot on the House floor, then plausible challengers would emerge.\n\nWhile Pelosi and her allies may think she is the best suited for the speakership, a recent poll indicates Democrats may be ready for a leadership change. According to Gallup, 56 percent of Democrats and independents who are liberal-minded want Pelosi to forgo the top leadership role she held between 2007 and 2011. The survey was undertaken between October 15 and October 28, several weeks prior to the midterm election. At least 87 Democrat candidates opted against endorsing Pelosi for the speakership while campaigning, while some outright stated they would not support her bid. Last month, Rep. Filemon Vela (D-TX) revealed at least a dozen incumbent congressmen would vote against Pelosi for the position regarding if they retook the House.", "Actress Jada Pinkett Smith admitted on Monday she holds prejudice against white women with blonde hair, claiming that they bullied her throughout her childhood because of her appearance.\n\n\u201cI think what crushes me, specifically in my relationship with white women, the thing that really breaks my heart is that white women understand what it feels to be oppressed,\u201d Pinkett Smith said during an episode of her Facebook chat show, \u201cRed Table Talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of their sex,\u201d her 17-year-old daughter Willow interjects.\n\n\u201cExactly.

Rick Scott (R-FL) and President Donald Trump were \u201cattempting to bully the election officials\u201d conducting the Florida recount like Broward County Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes.\n\nSchumer said, \u201cIt is a bedrock principle of our democracy that every vote is counted, and the Senate election in Florida must abide by that rule. Every single Florida voter, whether they mailed in their ballot, whether they showed up at the polls on election day to vote, no matter for whom they legally cast their vote, must have their vote counted. The hallmark of our democracy is simple; every vote must count. That\u2019s what Democrats believe. And that\u2019s what we are trying to get done. President Trump and Governor Scott seem dead set against counting every vote. Why? Because they are worried that if every vote is counted, Bill Nelson will be re-elected as senator from the great state of Florida.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cTrump and Scott are attempting to bully the election officials in Florida out of doing their jobs in an attempt to win this election. It\u2019s just plain wrong. It\u2019s un-American. Attempts to bully, threaten and cajole officials into not counting every vote is a large and dangerous step away from the democracy we all cherish. Trump and Scott must stop now. Donald Trump wants to rush the election and not let all the votes be counted. He said Bill Nelson should concede before everyone\u2019s vote is counted.

Eric Swalwell (D-CA) said President Donald Trump appointed acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker to be an \u201cassassin\u201d who kills special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nBLITZER: You saw this very strong article, the incoming chairman, we expect, Adam Schiff, of the Intelligence Committee, he just wrote it, posted in The Washington Post. \u2018Matthew Whitaker, we\u2019re watching you.\u2019 Very strong words. You\u2019ve got a strong tweet that you posted today, as well. Let me read it to our viewers: \u2018The days of presidential immunity are OVER.\u2019 Over, all caps. \u2018Gone. No more free passes to cash in on the \u2014 on access to Oval Office. No more colluding with Russia, and we\u2019ll see if you\u2019re a tax cheat. America is putting a balance of power on your abuses of power. Welcome to democracy.\u2019 So tell us exactly what you mean by that, including your reference to a balance of power.\n\nSWALWELL: And first, Wolf, happy Veterans Day to our veterans out there. That was a response to the president\u2019s tweet, blaming a dip in the stock market today on what he calls presidential harassment. And what he may be viewing as harassment is probably a response to the two years of immunity that he\u2019s been receiving and what he now sees is going to be oversight. And while we\u2019re going to prioritize, you know, the economy and lifting up, you know, wages and protecting health care, we\u2019re also no longer going to let the president get away with, you know, easing sanctions on Chinese companies while he gets a $500 million loan from the Chinese and a Trump Tower project. We\u2019re not going to allow the president to just, you know, kill this Russia investigation by hiring an assassin like Matt Whitaker to come in and take it out \u2014\n\nBLITZER: When you say assassin, what do you mean?\n\nSWALWELL: Yes, well, he\u2014 Whitaker was hired because of his views on the investigation, those views. He\u2019s prejudged the investigation. Vox has reported that the president and Whitaker have been plotting, essentially, to have Whitaker come in and wind down the investigation. If that had happened on Monday, you know, last Monday before the election, we would be powerless. But the voters want a check on these abuses of power. We\u2019re not powerless any more.\n\nBLITZER: So how are you going to divide up between what your Judiciary Committee is going to do in going after the president and the Intelligence Committee?\n\nSWALWELL: Well, we\u2019re not going to chase every ball that the president throws. We\u2019re going to prioritize what matters to our democracy and people in their everyday lives. And so first we want to make sure that no one is above the law. And so seek to protect Bob Mueller, by insisting that we have protect Mueller legislation.\n\nBLITZER: But you need Republicans, too.\n\nSWALWELL: Well, the Republicans have not been able to get a budget passed in the last two years with their own votes, despite controlling the House and the Senate. So if they want Democratic votes, we\u2019re saying they\u2019re going to need to ensure that the Mueller investigation \u2014\n\nBLITZER: So is that an absolute? You\u2019re not going to vote for must-pass legislation to keep the government open unless you have that kind of inclusion?\n\nSWALWELL: Again, they control government. So if they can sort it amongst themselves, they can pass it. But if they want Democrats at the table to work with them, we think that the rule of law is paramount in our country and we\u2019re going to insist on that.\n\nBLITZER: It\u2019s interesting. We spotted mike Michael Cohen, the president\u2019s former lawyer and fixer \u2014 he spent a decade working closely with Donald Trump. He\u2019s been in Washington today; he\u2019s just left. We\u2019ve got some video of him arriving at Union Station here in Washington. Here he\u2019s departing in late afternoon. We don\u2019t know what he was doing here. But his criminal defense attorney was with him, and we know that it follows that big explosive story in the Wall Street Journal the other day about the president\u2019s \u2014 President Trump\u2019s involvement in hush-money payments to two women. What\u2019s your understanding?\n\nSWALWELL: I hope he\u2019s coming clean. There\u2019s reporting that he\u2019s been talking to the special counsel. The special counsel has had a number of witnesses before the grand jury. It looks like they\u2019re moving toward, you know, more progress in indictments. But Mr. Cohen knows more beyond just campaign finance violations. I was a part of the interview of Mr. Cohen. He was negotiating with the Trump Tower property to go into Moscow during the primary when Russian-Americans who were connected to Vladimir Putin were offering to connect Putin and Trump. And they even said, \u2018If we do this right, we can engineer this and elect our boy as president.\u2019 So there\u2019s a lot of concerns about, you know, what Donald Trump knew about those offers while the Russians were interfering.\n\nBLITZER: And I just want to be precise. We spotted Michael Cohen here in Washington today for several hours with his criminal defense attorney. We also noticed that there were eight of Robert Mueller\u2019s attorneys working on this federal holiday, Veterans Day, today. We don\u2019t know what Michael Cohen was doing. We can surmise; we can guess.\n\nSWALWELL: Could have been at the mall. Just picking up \u2014\n\nBLITZER: I suspect \u2014 I don\u2019t suspect he was at the mall. If he would have been, maybe would have come with his family, as opposed to his lawyer. But do you believe that the hush-money payments are potentially impeachable offenses?\n\nSWALWELL: I think what they show, Wolf, are that these guys are shadowy operators, and it gives us reason to look at what they were doing with respect to the Russians, what they were doing with respect to the Saudi Arabians and deals that we suspect were being conducted at the time.\n\nYou know, I think we have to be careful that we don\u2019t, you know, go too far on what is an impeachable offense. And that whatever we investigate, you know, that we have impenetrable evidence and we seek to have bipartisan support. Because we don\u2019t want to be as reckless with the truth as the president is.\n\nBLITZER: You expect indictments this week?\n\nSWALWELL: I think, because of the number of people Bob Mueller has interviewed and that he took a pause for the midterm elections and now we\u2019re a week after the midterms, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me one bit.\n\nBLITZER: And you say you want bipartisan support. Bipartisan support to protect Robert Mueller right now. Do you see that happening?\n\nSWALWELL: I\u2019ve seen it already in the Senate. The Senate Judiciary Committee passed legislation to protect Bob Mueller. Mitch McConnell absolutely refuses to bring it to a vote. I hope, if we can pass that in the House, it will build momentum over there in the Senate.", "Google\u2019s services crashed worldwide for an hour recently after the company\u2019s traffic was routed from its regular paths to paths through Nigeria, China, and Russia.\n\nEngadget reports that Google services went down for an hour worldwide recently after the company\u2019s IP addresses were re-routed from their usual paths to ones running through Nigeria, China, and Russia. Despite the fact that the government-owned company China Telecom was recently found to be routing Western carrier traffic through mainland China, Google told Ars Technica that they do not believe that the leak was malicious.\n\nThe company\u2019s issues began when a carrier based out of Lagos in Nigeria declared that their system was the correct route for several hundred IP prefixes used by Google. This route was accepted by China Telecom which then declared it worldwide. This was then picked up by Transtelecom in Russia and other large ISP services around the world.\n\nCloudflare CEO Matthew Prince told Ars Technica that the sequence of events points to a \u201cbig, ugly screw-up\u201d rather than a premeditated malicious act by any of the company\u2019s involved. \u201cIf there was something nefarious afoot, there would have been a lot more direct, and potentially less disruptive/detectable ways to reroute traffic,\u201d said Prince. Instead, it might have been related to recent network meetings in Nigeria. \u201cWhile setting up a new interconnection, the Nigerian ISP almost certainly inadvertently leaked the routing information to China Telecom who then leaked it out to the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nGoogle says that this was not a huge internal issue for the company or the data it hosts, as all of it is encrypted, but this is an example of how fragile seemingly robust internet services can be and how much of the internet\u2019s operation still relies on trust.\n\nThe outage of Google services still would have affected G Suite customers worldwide, security research firm Thousand Eyes stated: \u201cThis incident at a minimum caused a massive denial of service to G Suite and Google Search.

In fact, the practice has become relatively common at universities all around the country.\n\nThe problem with these statements is not that they establish a commitment to cultivating a diverse campus community. The actual issue is that universities are often asking professors to endorse, either directly or indirectly, very specific policies and practices including affirmative action and massive multi-million dollar budgets for campus diversity offices. One can support the core goal of cultivating a diverse campus without supporting an overreaching administration that designs the faculty and student body based on their subjective interpretation of what diversity looks like.\n\nFlier and others are not wrong to worry that mandatory diversity statements imply that all faculty members are forced to support the latter.

For example, her video crew claimed they wanted to interview people about the Super Bowl win and the food that they were cooking. They did multiple shots of the grills and tailgate buses. Then proceeded to interview people about the Super Bowl and general Eagles questions. Out of nowhere during this interview she turned the questions into our thoughts on Malcolm Jenkins protests, Kaepernick kneeling and Black Lives Matter propaganda. The questions were purposely asked in a way that no answer would be correct. Her producer set up people to get a reaction. For the interview I was witnessing, the guys being interviewed declined to answer the questions after they realized they were being set up.

George (@McCormickProf) November 13, 2018\n\nMusa al-Gharbi, a senior fellow for Heterodox Academy, an organization which seeks to increase political diversity on college campuses, said that the journal would expand upon his organization\u2019s mission to \u201cget otherwise taboo ideas into the open.\u201d\n\nAl-Gharbi did, however, express uncertainty about the journal\u2019s policy on anonymous submissions. \u201cSuccessfully changing the dynamics will require people not only to trade provocative ideas behind a veil of anonymity, but also to stand up and refuse to go along with the prevailing orthodoxies \u2014 to leverage, and indeed stake, their social capital on holding the line, and even pushing back against censorious trends,\u201d al-Ghabri said.", "University of Idaho professor Robin Johnson argues that male gamers promote \u201ctechnomasculinity\u201d in a recent academic journal article.\n\nWhat is \u201ctechnomasculinity?\u201d Johnson explains that \u201ctechnomasculinity\u201d refers to the brand of masculinity that conjures up perceptions of men as being proficient with computers and technology.\n\n\u201cThe type of masculinity discussed is one that associates men with advanced computer knowledge and proficiency, and it is one part of a structure of hegemonic masculinity that also incorporates the more apparent militarized masculinity,\u201d Johnson writes.\n\nAt the outset of the piece, Johnson argues that video games have an obsessive focus on war, conquest, and combat. Johnson then links these themes to an alleged epidemic of sexism in the video game space.\n\nVideo games emerged in part from military-funded research, and there are ongoing links between military simulation research, military recruitment efforts, and the video game industry. The overall culture of video games was defined in gendered terms as the promotion of a \u201cmilitarized masculinity\u201d early in its ascendance into a prominent media industry with many game design practices and game narratives focused on scenarios of war, conquest, and combat. More than a decade later, game studies scholars continue to call attention to a \u201ctoxic gamer culture\u201d where incidents of sexism have \u201cbecome more virulent and concentrated in the past couple of years.\u201d\n\nJohnson conveniently ignores that both men and women have been fascinated by stories about conflict, combat, and conquest long before video games were created. The Greek myths depict a series of conflicts and battles amongst the Greek deities. The Epic of Gilgamesh, an epic poem from 2100 B.C. that is considered to be one of the oldest surviving pieces of great literature, features a \u201ctest of strength\u201d between two primary characters.\n\n\u201cGender is socially organized in the West in a hierarchized binary differentiating men and women along supposedly natural or biological masculine and feminine traits,\u201d Johnson argues in his piece.\n\nBut Johnson doesn\u2019t seem to mind ignoring the history of story-telling. In much of the academic world, the current brand of masculinity can be traced to mass media from the 20th century. In reality, video games merely adopt the themes that have been prevalent in stories throughout recorded human history.\n\nIf the West is truly a \u201chierarchized binary\u201d that separates men and women, then it\u2019s really hard to argue that video games are the cause.", "Broward County Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes is confident in the face of questions as to whether her office can count 700,000 ballots by Thursday\u2019s deadline, telling reporters Tuesday that \u201cthere has never been a deadline we have missed.\u201d\n\nSnipes is overseeing the county\u2019s recount of the midterm elections\u2019 U.S. Senate and governor\u2019s races.\n\nWATCH: 'We will complete the recount.

I think we do more sorting on election day than tonight,\u201d Snipes told reporters during a press briefing. \u201cBased on the way that the machines are moving and the amount of paper that they are processing, I think we are on a good schedule and we will finish before the deadline Thursday.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat has been our position,\u201d she maintained.\n\nLast Friday, a judge ordered Snipes to allow immediate inspection of voter records during an emergency hearing Friday. The court was asked to intervene in the tight U.S. Senate race between incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Gov. Rick Scott (R-FL) as the two sides prepare for a possible recount. Snipes defied a court order allowing the inspection of vote records Friday evening. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) has vowed to request a judge to hold the official in contempt of court.\n\nReacting to allegations of voter fraud, Snipes admitted that while there were some issues with counting ballots, the lawsuits against her office were an attempt to undercut her integrity.\n\n\u201cThere have been issues that didn\u2019t go the way we wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can call it a mistake, we can call it whatever you want to call it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lawsuits as they are written certainly cast dispersions on my character and usually we build character over a period of time and character is always on display. And I have worked here for about 15 years and I have to say this is the first time that this office or I have been under such attacks,\u201d Snipes told the press. \u201cIf we make mistakes, we own mistakes. If there is something that the public needs to know, then we provide that information.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump has ratcheted up criticism of Snipes, saying the top Broward elections official has a \u201chorrible history.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have had a horrible history, and if you look at the person, in this case a woman involved, she has had a horrible history.\u201d said President Trump. \u201cAnd all of the sudden they\u2019re finding votes out of nowhere.There\u2019s bad things that have gone on in Broward County, really bad things.\u201d\n\nResponding to the criticism, Snipes suggested President Trump was equipped with inaccurate information regarding the recount: \u201cWe are in an era when people oftentimes speak without having vetted the information. I\u2019m not sure where the President gets his information from. I have not spoken with him. And I don\u2019t want to make any other comments on that.\u201d\n\nAs Government Accountability Insititute (GAI) research director Eric Eggers told SiriusXM Patriot\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight\u2018s Senior Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour, Snipes has a history of miraculously \u201cfinding\u201d ballots following elections:\n\nShe\u2019s also been accused of illegally opening ballots. The Florida GOP sued her for this and when they brought her to court, they said \u2018Hey, your office is opening ballots outside the presence of the canvassing board \u2026 what\u2019s your explanation?\u2019 And again, the woman in charge of elections in Florida\u2019s second most populous county argued she thought it was okay because her office didn\u2019t understand the meaning of the word \u2018canvassing.\u2019 [Emphasis added] \u2026 This is also not the first time that her office has just found ballots. There was actually a canvassing official back in 2012 that complained that heading into a weekend, they were told there were about 150 votes left to be counted and then Monday morning, well actually there are about 950 votes still to go. [Emphasis added]\n\n\u2026\n\nAs Broward moves to complete the recount by Thursday, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) expressed doubt Snipes\u2019 office will get the job done. \u201cDeadline for recount is Thursday. #PalmBeach already said they won\u2019t make it. #BrowardCounty just started recount today,3 days after most every other county & will probably miss as well,\u201d Rubio tweeted. \u201cDemanding they follow law isn\u2019t effort to stop vote count,its effort to stop law breaking.\u201d", "The midterm elections brought both good news and bad news for Big Tech. On the one hand, they are less likely to face pressure on censorship from Democrat-controlled House committees. On the other hand, the Silicon Valley Masters of the Universe must now contend with new Republican senators who are vocal critics of their policies.\n\nThe House\n\nPrior to the midterms, Republican-controlled House committees were eager to call Silicon Valley representatives to Capitol Hill to answer charges of bias against conservatives on their platforms. Earlier this year, the House Energy and Commerce Committee called Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey before it to answer questions on content moderation and algorithms. At the hearing, the Twitter CEO admitted that his platform is part of the \u201cpublic square\u201d \u2014 an important legal categorization, as the First Amendment should apply in public squares. The House Judiciary Committee and Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice have also held hearings on social media censorship in the past year.\n\nNow that Democrats are in control of the House, they will take control of those committees, where they will be far more reluctant to call big tech CEOs to account on anti-conservative censorship. The Judiciary Committee, for example, will now come under the chairmanship of Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), who has previously belittled conservative concerns about Silicon Valley bias as \u201cbaseless\u201d and a \u201choax.\u201d Energy and Commerce Committee Democrats have said allegations of Twitter \u201cshadowbanning conservatives \u2014 confirmed by leftist outlets like Vice and Gizmodo \u2014 are a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the biggest win for Silicon Valley is the fact that neither Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) nor Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) will be Speaker of the House next year. Rep. McCarthy became one of the most vocal critics of big tech in 2018, repeatedly calling them out for bias in public statements and op-eds. Rep. Jordan was similarly hawkish on Silicon Valley, calling for a Congressional investigation of free speech restrictions by big tech. Both were considered top contenders for the Speaker\u2019s gavel.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai, who has so far avoided congressional appearances on big tech bias, promised that he would attend a House Judiciary Committee hearing after the midterms. Now that Democrats are in charge, he may opt to ride out the storm engulfing his company, beset by leaked videos and documents highlighting the company\u2019s biased leadership and, in its own researchers\u2019 words, its \u201cshift towards censorship.\u201d\n\nThe House elections aren\u2019t all good news for Big Tech. While House Democrats have largely ignored the censorship issue, they have been far from quiet on Silicon Valley\u2019s invasive data collection policies. Likely Energy Committee chairman Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) has said one of his priorities is developing \u201cmeaningful privacy and data security protections.\u201d And top Judiciary Committee Democrat Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) has previously accused Facebook CEO of lying to Congress about his company\u2019s data harvesting practices.\n\nThe Senate\n\nIf Big Tech can hope for less scrutiny on anti-conservative bias in the House, the opposite is true in the Senate, where Republican critics of Silicon Valley swept a number of key races.\n\nPerhaps the one that strikes the most fear into Silicon Valley is Marsha Blackburn, the incoming Senator from Tennessee. Few Republicans faced as much opposition from big tech. At the very start of her run for the Senate, Twitter censored Blackburn\u2019s campaign announcement video on the grounds that its pro-life messages were \u201cinflammatory.\u201d Twitter later reversed its ban, although internal emails show its initial decision had support from a senior search engineer at Google, who called Blackburn a \u201cterrorist\u201d and accused her ad of spreading \u201clibel.\u201d In the closing days of the campaign, Google refused an ad buy from Blackburn and Facebook briefly shut down a pro-Blackburn ad from the pro-life Susan B. Anthony list. Senator-elect Blackburn, who has warned tech companies that \u201cno-one is too big to regulate,\u201d enters the upper chamber with first-hand experience of Silicon Valley censorship.\n\nAnother disappointing race for big tech \u2014 and gushing liberal columnists everywhere \u2014 was Texas. Progressive poster boy Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke failed in his bid to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz, the upper chamber\u2019s most vocal critic of anti-conservative bias in Silicon Valley. Over the past year, Sen. Cruz has pulled precisely zero punches against the tech giants, calling them a \u201creal and present danger\u201d to American democracy, and has called for antitrust laws to be enforced against them. He has repeatedly pointed out that social media companies acting as censors makes them more like publishers than platforms, a legal distinction that would rob them of legal immunity for user-generated content and risks destroying their entire business model. While tech companies furiously deny this in public, their leaked internal briefings tell a different story.\n\nAnother headache for Silicon Valley is incoming Senator Josh Hawley, the former Missouri attorney general who unseated two-term Democrat Claire McCaskill with a resounding 6-point victory. As state attorney general Hawley already conducted an antitrust investigation against Google, accusing the tech giant of violating Missouri\u2019s antitrust and consumer protection laws. Bloomberg Businessweek went so far as to call his state AG office \u201cthe command center for the war against the world\u2019s second-most valuable company.\u201d With President Trump talking about using antitrust laws against big tech, Hawley\u2019s experience gives him an exceptional opportunity to move the Senate in the same direction. Google should be worried!\n\nOn balance, the midterms may add to Silicon Valley\u2019s woes. Although they\u2019re unlikely to be called before the House about censorship in the next two years, House Democrats are more than willing to ramp up the pressure on the issue of data collection. Meanwhile, big tech is likely to face stiff attacks from incoming Republican senators who may join forces with the White House to take on Silicon Valley\u2019s masters of the universe.\n\nAllum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

But the dichotomy between the American and Chinese tech industries has never attracted as much scrutiny as today, when the world\u2019s two richest countries are butting heads in a conflict that may shape a new world order. As U.S. icons like Google and Facebook come under fire for privacy violations and enabling hate speech, their Chinese counterparts are touting theirs as the superior model: one geared toward the interests of the state. \u201cThe Chinese economy is a vast ocean.

Americans can purchase short-term health plans for as many as to 36 months, which serve as a less expensive option for those who cannot afford Obamacare insurance plans.\n\nFearing increased health insurance premiums, Delaware will curb short-term health plans in the state for three months to curb Delaware citizens\u2019 consumer freedom in the state.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the current unsubsidized monthly premium for Delaware\u2019s Obamacare exchanges costs $750 per month, whereas short-term health plans start at approximately $75 per month.\n\nDelaware was not the first state to curb short-term health plans. In September, California banned short-term health insurance.\n\nCovered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, featured far more expensive plans compared to short-term health plans. A mid-level Silver policy cost roughly $400 per month in southern California and approximately $500 per month in northern California, which compares to only $91 per month for a short-term policy.\n\nHeritage Foundation health scholar Doug Badger said in a research paper that short-term health plans \u201coffer broader choices of providers and lower premiums for people in good health than Obamacare policies.\u201d\n\nBadger added that short-term plans were \u201coffering a lifeboat enabling them to escape Obamacare\u2019s sinking ship.\u201d\n\nCato Institute health scholar Michael Cannon contended in May that Trump\u2019s expansion of short-term health plans could cost 90 percent less than Obamacare plans.\n\nCannon chastised Democrats for trying to protect Obamacare over affordable health insurance.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are literally trying to stop Republicans from expanding consumer protections because they would rather protect Obamacare,\u201d the Cato scholar wrote.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive actions on Obamacare have offered Americans less expensive health insurance options.\n\nLand O\u2019Lakes announced this month that it created America\u2019s first Association Health Plan (AHP), which is nearly 50 percent less expensive than Obamacare, thanks to President Trump\u2019s executive orders.\n\nWhen the president signed the executive order expanding AHPs and short-term plans, Sen.

In its last quarterly report in August, the agency also concluded Iran had stayed within key limitations set by the JCPOA.\n\nChannel News Asia noted a few details from the report that may prove unsatisfying to those critical of the IAEA\u2019s work, including a significant but acceptable increase in Iran\u2019s uranium stockpile and the failure to mention evidence of Iranian cheating introduced by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in April.\n\nNetanyahu said the trove of Iranian files Israeli intelligence secured proved Tehran was \u201cbrazenly lying when it said it never had a nuclear program,\u201d so the JCPOA was \u201cbased on Iranian lies and Iranian deception.\u201d\n\nCritics of the JCPOA say the evidence Israel uncovered deserved more scrutiny than international media and the IAEA gave it. As Joshua Block of The Israel Project argued at The Hill in October, the IAEA has a history of overlooking evidence of Iranian perfidy uncovered by Israel, leaving the agency with a much less complete picture of Iranian compliance than it claims to possess:\n\nDefenders of the nuclear deal have argued that the United States is wrong to impose sanctions on Iran because the IAEA confirmed it has been complying with the deal. But with its failure to establish a full picture of Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, it can\u2019t be said to have confirmed the country\u2019s compliance; just that Iran didn\u2019t blatantly violate the deal at any site that the IAEA has access to. When he revealed Iran\u2019s nuclear archive in April, Netanyahu said Iran kept the files to \u201cuse them at a later date.\u201d In other words, the gaps in the IAEA\u2019s knowledge of Iran\u2019s nuclear program mean the deal enables Iran to do what Obama said the accord would never allow: develop nuclear weapons. There is a lot that we don\u2019t know about Iran\u2019s nuclear program. There is a lot we will be unable to know because the deal has too many holes, and the IAEA is unable \u2014 or unwilling \u2014 to address them.\n\nNational Security Adviser John Bolton is on the same page. \u201cIf the Iranian regime continues to lie, cheat, and deceive; if it threatens the United States and our allies; if it harms our citizens, there will be hell to pay,\u201d he said last week.", "Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado published a letter on Monday directed at Chinese Communist Party chief Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, intended to discourage both countries from continuing to do business with Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s socialist regime.\n\nMachado is the head of Vente Venezuela, the most consistently anti-socialist opposition party in the country. A former lawmaker, Machado has sustained multiple physical assaults, including a police tear gas attack upon being expelled from the National Assembly in 2014 and an attack from a socialist mob a month ago during a political rally in broad daylight.\n\nRussia and China are two of Venezuela\u2019s most prominent benefactors. Russian banks were the first in line to deal in the fictitious cryptocurrency, the \u201cpetro,\u201d following Maduro\u2019s debut of it. China recently welcomed Maduro to Beijing and inked a deal trading millions of barrels of oil for billions in financing.\n\nMachado announced a letter-writing campaign on Twitter this week, noting that the socialist regime has banned her from leaving the country and, thus, meeting with any world leaders. She began the campaign with a letter to Xi and Putin, she explains, because their nations have most recently engaged the Maduro regime:\n\n2/3 Mi 1ra carta va dirigida a Pdtes d China,Xi Jinping,y d Rusia,Vladimir Putin; cuyos pa\u00edses son miembros permanentes del Consejo de Seguridad ONU.

Security Council, without mentioning they are the most likely on the council to vote against any action to stabilize the Venezuelan government and urges them to use that leverage to galvanize global action to end the violence and starvation pervasive in Maduro\u2019s Venezuela.\n\nChina and Russia, she writes, \u201ccan make an extraordinary contribution to generating the regime change that Venezuela needs, in order to return to the basic principles that foment stability and progress.\u201d She warns, \u201cFailure to pursue this would be a mistake, the consequences of which would result in further deaths and global insecurity.\u201d\n\nMachado concludes by suggesting that no longer enabling the Maduro regime, which has collapsed the Venezuelan economy and forced thousands to flee the country, \u201cwill provide great opportunities for [their] country\u2019s cooperation with the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and the rest of the global community.\u201d\n\nMachado has been one of the most prominent figures in the anti-socialist movement in Venezuela since long before Maduro took over for late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2013. She has suffered tremendous physical harm as a result. That year, socialist lawmakers attacked Machado on the floor of the National Assembly, leaving purple welts on her face and breaking her nose. In 2014, she suffered a tear gas attack for attempting to enter her office at the legislature after being arbitrarily stripped of her powers. Maduro has since illegally dissolved the National Assembly and replaced it with something called the \u201cnational constituents\u2019 assembly,\u201d made up of prominent socialists, including Maduro\u2019s wife and son.\n\nMachado and her allies have long focused on attracting the attention of friendly international governments, such as the United States. Addressing Xi and Putin directly is a shift in strategy, suggesting to those countries that it is no longer financially feasible to do business with Maduro.\n\nAfter years of slowly withdrawing from Venezuela out of distrust of the Maduro regime, Maduro convinced Xi in a September visit to Beijing to lend Caracas $5 billion, allegedly in exchange for at least one million barrels of crude oil. Venezuela has the world\u2019s largest oil reserves but has largely failed to pump and refine that oil after Ch\u00e1vez replaced the heads of the state-run Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) with inexperienced socialist cronies.\n\nEconomists argued following Maduro\u2019s Beijing trip that a $5 billion injection into the Venezuelan economy was nowhere near enough to offset the calamitous inflation rates and gross socialist mismanagement that had collapsed the economy.\n\nLike China, Russia has also bought into economic deals with Maduro. Following Maduro\u2019s announcement that he would launch the fictitious petro, Evrofinance Mosnarbank, a Russian bank, was the first and only international institution expressing interest in backing the currency.\n\nFollowing his meeting with Chinese officials, Maduro held a meeting in New York with Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during September\u2019s United Nations General Assembly open debate. Most recently, Russia sent a financial delegation to Venezuela in October to discuss preventing a full economic collapse in the Latin American nation.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "National Security Advisor John Bolton warned the Chinese government Tuesday that Washington would sternly oppose any attempts to block free transit in the international waters of the South China Sea.\n\nThe public caution anticipates Beijing proposing a \u201ccode of conduct\u201d in the region to grant it control of territory far outside its borders.\n\nChina claims most of the South China Sea and has illegally constructed islands and military facilities in territory belonging to the Philippines and Vietnam.

The fact that all these voters have been marching and protesting since he was elected and then took it to the ballot box in 2018. That\u2019s why 2018 was an important election for all of us. It was a wake up for America to fight for what you believe in and to restore our democracy to its foundings.\u201d\n\nShe later added, \u201cI think this election was about creating oversight and accountability over this president and what he\u2019s done in office.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 CNN sued the Trump administration Tuesday, demanding that correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s credentials to cover the White House be returned because it violates the constitutional right of freedom of the press.\n\nThe administration stripped Acosta of his pass to enter the White House following President Donald Trump\u2019s contentious news conference last week, where Acosta refused to give up a microphone when the president said he didn\u2019t want to hear anything more from him.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said \u201cthis is just more grandstanding from CNN, and we will vigorously defend against his lawsuit.\u201d\n\nTrump has made CNN and its reporters a particular target of his denunciation of \u201cfake news\u201d and characterization of the media as an enemy of the people. CNN CEO Jeff Zucker, in a letter to White House chief of staff John Kelly, called it a \u201cpattern of targeted harassment.\u201d\n\nThe White House initially contended it was Acosta\u2019s refusal to give up the microphone that led to his banishment; CNN said it\u2019s apparent the president didn\u2019t like his questions.\n\n\u201cMr. Acosta\u2019s press credentials must be restored so that all members of the press know they will remain free to ask tough questions, challenge government officials and report the business of the nation to the American people,\u201d said Theodore Olson, former U.S. solicitor general and one of CNN\u2019s lawyers on the case.\n\nThe White House Correspondents\u2019 Association backed the lawsuit, filed in Washington, D.C., district court.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him,\u201d said Olivier Knox, president of the correspondents\u2019 group.\n\nCNN said Acosta was given no warning of the action, and no recourse to appeal it. Acosta traveled to Paris to cover Trump\u2019s visit there this weekend and, although given permission by the French government to cover a news event, the Secret Service denied him entrance, the company said.\n\n\u201cWithout this credential, a daily White House correspondent like Acosta effectively cannot do his job,\u201d CNN\u2019s lawsuit said.\n\nCNN asked for an injunction to immediately reinstate Acosta, as well as a hearing on the larger issue of barring a reporter.\n\nIn an effort to prove the administration\u2019s case last week, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders distributed via Twitter a doctored video sped up to make Acosta\u2019s physical actions toward the intern seem more threatening.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t mentioned by Sanders in a statement Tuesday. She cited his refusal to yield to other reporters after he asked Trump two questions.\n\n\u201cThe White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe First Amendment is not served when a single reporter, of more than 150 present, attempts to monopolize the floor.\u201d\n\nTrump told Acosta at the news conference that \u201cCNN should be ashamed of itself, having you work for them. You are a rude, terrible person.\u201d\n\nAcosta has been a polarizing figure even beyond the distaste that Trump and his supporters have for him. The Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank, editorialized last week that Acosta\u2019s encounter with Trump at the news conference \u201cwas less about asking questions and more about making statements. In doing so, the CNN White House reporter gave President Donald Trump room to critique Acosta\u2019s professionalism.\u201d", "Left-wing attorney Michael Avenatti is the choice of zero Democrats as their 2020 presidential nominee, according to a Morning Consult poll.\n\nWhile \u201cother\u201d earned three percent in this poll of 733 registered Democrats, and some guy named Steve Bullock grabbed one percent, in a field of 20 names, the cable news star and lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels came in dead least at number 20.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, nearly a quarter of Democrats, some 21 percent, said \u201cDon\u2019t Know/No Opinion\u201d over Avenatti.\n\nIn order to earn one percent in this poll, Avenatti needed the support of only seven or eight of those 733 people.\n\nThe poll\u2019s big winners were two very old white guys. Coming in first place, with 26 percent, is 76-year-old Joe Biden. Coming in second place, with 19 percent, is 146-year-old Bernie Sanders.\n\nIn-between you will find Beto O\u2019Rourke at eight percent; Elizabeth Warren at 5 percent; Kamala Harris at four percent, and a dozen or so names at one percent.\n\nOnly four names land at zero percent, and among those four, Avenatti is last.\n\nWatching the establishment media coverage of Avenatti, you would not think this could be true. Avenatti is practically CNN\u2019s mascot, but he is seen and written about all over.\n\nA quick search of Google News results in 25 top stories over the last 48 hours about all things Avenatti. Every tweet of his, every threat, utterance, and statement is news and has been for more than a year.\n\nAvenatti has also made no secret of the fact he wants to run for president.\n\nNevertheless, despite all this free media hype and publicity, despite all this free media affection and promotion, exactly zero rank and file Democrats support Avenatti as their 2020 nominee.\n\nMy guess is that the rank and file have not forgotten just how badly Lex Luthor: Mall Cop bungled things last month as Democrats and their media allies sought to personally destroy Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation process.\n\nA number of Democrats blame Avenatti for undercutting their orchestrated smear campaign with his client\u2019s wild (and later debunked) claims about Kavanaugh being a serial gang rapist; and now he has been referred by the Senate Judiciary Committee to the Justice Department for possible criminal action.\n\nAvenatti is loud and telegenic and knows how to hit the sweet spot for cable news anchors who despise Trump. But\u2026\n\nBetween his disastrous personal finances, his bellyflop during the consequential Kavanaugh battle, and blowing things so badly with Stormy Daniels that she now owes President Trump money \u2014 Democrat voters appear to know a loser when they see one.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Being a Christian in a country swarming with Islamists.\n\nIf she stays she faces almost certain death. Two of the politicians who bravely defended her \u2013 Salman Taseer and Shahbaz Bhatti \u2013 have already been assassinated, while her lawyer Saif Mulook has fled to the Netherlands.\n\nBut where can she go?\n\nThe obvious place would be the country with the strongest cultural and historical ties to the Indian subcontinent, the one that included what\u2019s now known as Pakistan as part of its Empire for more than two centuries.\n\nUnfortunately, the British government appears to have wussed out. Theresa May and her advisors, it has been reported, do not want to give refuge to this exhausted, sick, middle aged Christian woman because \u2013 allegedly \u2013 it would \u201ccause security concerns and unrest among certain sections of the community and would also be a security threat to British embassies abroad which might be targeted by Islamist terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe second excuse is feeble indeed. Britain currently gives Pakistan nearly \u00a3500 million a year in foreign aid. If Imran Khan\u2019s Islamabad regime can\u2019t provide a measure of security in return, then let\u2019s squander that money on some better hopeless cause \u2013 the NHS, say.\n\nBut the first excuse is plain disgusting. Is Britain really saying to the world that it no longer dares to take a principled stand on certain key moral issues for fear of provoking an adverse response from all the Islamists on its home territory?\n\nDouglas Murray too is troubled by that weasel phrase \u201ccertain sections of the community.\u201d\n\nHe writes at National Review:\n\nAnd which sections would that be? Would it be Anglicans or atheists who would be furious that an impoverished and severely traumatized woman should be given shelter in their country? Of course not. The \u201ccommunity\u201d that the British government will be scared of is the community that comes from the same country that has tortured Asia Bibi for the last eight years.\n\nHe concludes:\n\nIn any case, if it is true that the British government has declined to offer Asia Bibi asylum for this reason, then it should lead to a huge national and international outcry. Among other things, it suggests that the British government has got its priorities exactly the wrong way around. For it is not Asia Bibi who should not be in Britain. It is anyone from the \u201ccommunities\u201d who would not accept Asia Bibi being in Britain who should not be in the country. Though I wouldn\u2019t expect any British politician to express that simple truth any time soon.\n\nPerhaps not, but at least some British politicians are getting there. Boris Johnson has declared that Bibi, a Catholic mother-of-five, has an \u201coverwhelming claim for compassion from the British government\u201d.\n\nHis intervention, though no doubt wholly sincere, is also a handy reminder of just what an ugly, out-of-touch, craven, decaying and deservedly doomed regime is in charge of Britain right now \u2013 and of how much better things might be once a candidate like Boris has stepped in instead.\n\nIf Theresa May remains resistant to doing the right thing \u2013 it certainly wouldn\u2019t be a first \u2013 then perhaps the leader of the free world should step in to show her how it\u2019s done.\n\nBy rescuing Asia Bibi, Donald Trump could kill two birds with one stone: take the moral high ground while revealing one of the world leaders he likes least for the moral pygmy she is.", "Broward County Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes was recently assisted by two organizations financed by billionaire activist George Soros in response to a lawsuit from a conservative group accusing her of maintaining inaccurate voter rolls.\n\nSnipes is currently at the center of controversy in the Florida recount drama, with multiple Republicans calling for her removal due to past legal problems. \u201cThere is no question that Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes failed to comply with Florida law on multiple counts, undermining Floridians\u2019 confidence in our electoral process,\u201d former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tweeted on Monday. \u201cSupervisor Snipes should be removed from her office following the recounts.\u201d\n\nLast March, a judge ruled that Snipes had implemented a \u201creasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters by reason of death or change of address.\u201d The ruling came in response to a 2017 case in which the American Civil Rights Union used data it had collected about population, age and citizenship to claim that Snipes was failing to take steps to maintain accurate voter rosters.\n\nIn the case, Snipe testified that ineligible voters do indeed \u201cslip through,\u201d the Sun-Sentinel reported:\n\nThe ACRU case focused on voter lists that included dead people, 130-year-olds, felons, duplicate registrations, invalid commercial addresses and that had \u201cimprobably high\u201d voter registration rates. Snipes testified that some people who have been registered \u201care not eligible to vote and they slip through.\u201d \u201cThis is a huge job that has so many pieces,\u201d especially when dealing with a roll of 1.1 million voters that is constantly changing, Snipes said. \u201cSure, you\u2019re going to have mistakes.\u201d \u2026 During the trial, former Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler testified about ways Snipes could be doing more. She could use cumulative Social Security death information to determine if any voters have died out of state. She could access the state\u2019s Driver and Vehicle Information Database, called DAVID, to more quickly identify voters whose addresses have changed. She could review jury forms that indicate when individuals are excused from service because they no longer live in the county or are non-citizens.\n\nNotably, the intervener in the case on Snipes\u2019 behalf was the SEIU union\u2019s United Healthcare Workers East, which was represented on the matter by lawyers from Demos and Project Vote, both of which are funded by Soros. An intervener allows a non-party to join an ongoing lawsuit.\n\nStuart Naifeh, senior counsel at Demos, was the lead attorney in the case.\n\nAlso representing the intervener on behalf of the litigation against Snipes were attorneys Catherine M. Flanagan and Michelle Kanter Cohen from Project Vote.\n\nDemos says its mission is to ensure \u201can equal say in our democracy and an equal chance in our economy.\u201d Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations is a prominent donor to Demos.\n\nDemos has pushed for what it calls \u201cfair redistricting\u201d and an end to \u201cprison gerrymandering\u201d in the 2020 Census; in other words, counting incarcerated people in the census. At issue is whether to count incarcerated people as \u201cresidents\u201d of prison locations. A 2014 study examining voter trends of prisoners in three states found that in each state \u2014 New York, New Mexico and North Carolina \u2014 the majority of convicts voted for Democrats.\n\nDemos previously worked closely with the now defunct ACORN, even putting out joint reports with ACORN and Project Vote. ACORN shuttered after its workers were ensnared in a voter registration fraud scandal.\n\nThe other intervener in the Snipes case, Project Vote, is not only a grantee of Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations but is listed as a partner. \u201cAnother form of partnership is also of enormous importance to the Soros foundations: the relationships with grantees that over the years have developed into alliances in pursuing crucial parts of the open society agenda,\u201d reads an Open Society Foundations report listing Project Vote as a partner.\n\nThe alliance between Project Vote and Soros\u2019s Foundations was \u201cfor registering voters in the United States and analyzing election law.\u201d\n\nWhen Snipes and 248 county election officials were presented with a notice from conservative judicial groups threatening a lawsuit last year if they did not cull the voting rolls of deceased or ineligible voters, Demos and the heavily Soros-financed Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University Law School offered to help.\n\nOver the weekend, Florida Gov.

There is nothing to see here!\u201d\n\nIf you have never seen Naked Gun, you can instead just watch CNN\u2019s coverage of Florida\u2019s election fiasco, as they shout to millions of Americans, \u201cThere is nothing to see here!\u201d\n\nEnter Blackwell, who points over their shoulder at the explosions and flames, as he says, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I see something over there.\u201d\n\nCamerota skeptically tasked Blackwell with proving how there is anything out of the ordinary in Broward County, and why voters should be concerned.\n\n\u201cThere is a history of chronic malfeasance,\u201d begins Blackwell. \u201cThere have been lapses in transparency and missed deadlines, and as a result, 93,000 votes have materialized.\u201d\n\nThat history is long and colorful. A court found that in 2016, Snipes illegally destroyed ballots in a contested primary between former DNC Chair, Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, and her primary challenger. Snipes is an elected Democrat.\n\nIn her own most recent election as a partisan Democrat in 2016, Snipes released the election results 30 minutes before the polls closed, despite the fact that this is a felony in Florida. (A contractor claimed responsibility for the illegal release. No charges were ever filed.)\n\nAnd in this very election, a state judge in Broward County has ruled that Snipes violated Florida public records laws for not following a demand by Gov. Rick Scott, who has now sued Snipes.\n\nThe numbers tell the story, as Blackwell explained. Florida law requires all ballots except for provisional ballots to be added to the totals by 7:30 p.m. on Election Day, half an hour after polls close. At that time, Snipes reported 634,000 total votes for Broward County.\n\nThat was Tuesday. By Friday, Snipes reported 717,000 votes \u2013 an increase of 83,000 in violation of Florida law.

They lost it in the State Senate when voters recalled freshman State Sen. Josh Newman (D-Fullerton) after he joined a two-thirds majority in voting for the gas tax hike of 2017.\n\nBut the gas tax hike survived a referendum, Proposition 6, and the Democrats picked up key seats elsewhere \u2014 most notably in the Central Valley, where Republican State Sen. Andy Vidak had once inspired the GOP by winning a special election in a majority Latino district in 2013, and winning re-election since.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported (original links):\n\nDemocrats claimed victory Monday in two state Senate races, giving them back the two-thirds supermajority they lost in June when Orange County Democrat Josh Newman was recalled after he voted in favor of Gov.

Andy Vidak of Hanford (Kings County). Caballero won a seat left vacant when GOP state Sen. Anthony Cannella was termed out of office. The victories give Democrats 28 seats in the 40-member Senate, one more than they needed for a supermajority. They already hold a two-thirds advantage in the Assembly, enabling them to pass virtually any legislation without Republican help.\n\nThe supermajority will give Governor-elect Gavin Newsom the ability to push his agenda through the legislature with minimal opposition.\n\nBallots continue to be counted in several congressional races, where two Orange County Republicans still hold narrow but diminishing leads: Young Kim in the 39th district, and incumbent Rep.

(AFP)\n\nAn Israeli army officer and seven Palestinians were killed in a gunfight that followed a botched Israeli army military undercover operation in Gaza on Sunday evening.\n\nIsraeli special forces members wore women\u2019s clothing to avoid detection and crossed the border into Gaza. This follows another \u201ccloak and dagger\u201d operation on Thursday when a car crossed into Gaza carrying three suitcases in the back seat stuffed with $15 million in cash from Qatar.\n\nWhen the car was two miles into Gaza, near Khan Younis, fighters of the Izzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, stopped the car and asked to see ID cards. A gunfight ensued, killing one Israeli military officer, who has not been identified, and seven Palestinians. One of the Palestinians was an Al-Qassam Brigades senior command, Noureddin Mohammad Salama Baraka, 37.\n\nDue to the secrecy of the operation, Israel has not revealed the specific purpose of the mission. According to one report, it was an intelligence-gathering operation that went wrong. According to another report, the objective was to kill Baraka, although Israel denied this, saying that the operation was \u201cnot intended to kill or abduct terrorists, but to strengthen Israeli security.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli car fled the scene followed by Al-Qassam fighters, bombed from the air by an extraction operation that rescued the Israelis with a helicopter. Guardian (London) and Jerusalem Post and International Mideast Media Center (Palestine) and AP\n\nPalestinians demand \u2018revenge\u2019 but Hamas backs off from war\n\nIn the worst bout of fighting since the end of the 67-day war between Israel and Gaza in 2014, Palestinians launched over 200 rockets and mortar bombs into Israel on Monday. One mortar bomb hit a bus, wounding an Israeli. At least seven Israelis were wounded by other rocket strikes.\n\nIsraeli tanks and fighter jets retaliated by bombing sites across Gaza. Palestinian officials said that at least three people, including two militants, were killed. Israeli missiles also struck and destroyed Gaza\u2019s Al-Aqsa television station, as well as a number of apartment buildings believed to house Hamas militants.\n\nThis intense exchange of fire occurred just two days after $15 million in money from Qatar entered Gaza, paying civil service workers\u2019 salaries. This money was supposed to help bring calm, but it is worth noting that the money to pay civil service workers\u2019 salaries was blocked for months not by Israel but by Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority. Abbas strongly opposed the infiltration of Qatari money last week as a betrayal of the Palestinian cause and may be pleased with Monday\u2019s exchange of fire.\n\nReports are that the Israeli army is preparing for all-out war in Gaza, renewing the 2014 summer Gaza war, especially after Hamas threatened on Monday that Israel will pay a \u201cheavy price\u201d for the operation.\n\nHowever, Egypt and the U.N., which in the past have been mediators between Israel and Hamas, are hoping to bring about a ceasefire. In addition, a number of analysts are saying that Hamas does not want a war with Israel, at least not at this time, or to give Israel an excuse to launch a major military operation in Gaza.\n\nBesides saying that Israel will pay a \u201cheavy price,\u201d Hamas\u2019s rhetoric has not gone further to say that the incident will affect efforts to reach a truce agreement with Israel. Also, Hamas leaders have not accused Israel of sabotaging the ongoing efforts to achieve a truce in the Gaza Strip. Nor have they indicated that Hamas views the incident, which took place near Khan Younis, as a trigger for another war with Israel.\n\nHamas and militants in Gaza have been attacking Israel with rockets that have no guidance systems. Reports indicate that they also possess an arsenal of middle range and long-range missiles that reach cities all across Israel, but they have refrained from using them.\n\nHamas issued a statement saying, \u201cThe resistance last night taught the enemy a harsh lesson and turned its intelligence system into the laughing stock of the world.\u201d The statement claimed that Hamas scored a major victory over the Israelis, who were forced to flee after being spotted by Hamas militants.\n\nWhat these statements mean is that the leaders of Hamas have much to lose at this time in a war with Israel, especially with the influx of Qatari money and promises of further concessions. That means that there probably will not be a new Gaza war, at least for a while.\n\nGenerational Dynamics predicts that the Mideast is headed for a major regional war refighting the 1948 war between Jews and Arabs that followed the partitioning of Palestine and the creation of the state of Israel. The war will also pit Sunnis versus Shias and various ethnic groups against each other. Generational Dynamics predicts that, in the approaching Clash of Civilizations world war, the \u201caxis\u201d of China, Pakistan, and the Sunni Muslim countries will be pitted against the \u201callies,\u201d the U.S., India, Russia, and Iran.

This represents the highest number since the previous record set in November 2016 (47,211), the month U.S. voters elected President Trump.\n\nWhile the increase from November 2016 to October 2018 represents only an eight percent increase, the demographics of those migrants are dramatically different.

Those numbers jumped in October 2018 to 23,121 \u2014 an increase of 49 percent.\n\nMigrant apprehensions also make a dramatic jump between September and October this year. In September 2018, agents apprehended 41,486 migrants.

If you\u2019re asking if we\u2019ve \u2026 looked at putting a plus-size model in the show, we have. We invented the plus-size model show in what was our sister division, Lane Bryant.

We market to who we sell to, and we don\u2019t market to the whole world.\n\nBut the company is under constant social media pressure to weaken the hugely valuable brand by sharing its feminine glamor with non-targeted groups, he said. \u201cThe hate that\u2019s on social media, it\u2019s extraordinarily toxic \u2026 Where does it end?\u201d he said, adding:\n\nSo it\u2019s like, why don\u2019t you do [size] 50?

No. No, I don\u2019t think we should. Well, why not? Because the show is a fantasy. It\u2019s a 42-minute entertainment special. That\u2019s what it is.

But he carefully did not promise to hire a transgender model, saying:\n\nPlease read this important message from Ed Razek, Chief Marketing Officer, L Brands (parent company of Victoria\u2019s Secret). pic.twitter.com/CW8BztmOaM \u2014 Victoria's Secret (@VictoriasSecret) November 10, 2018\n\nThe Tweeted message, however, excluded the \u201chope\u201d comment from the email statement sent to ModernFashionNews.com:\n\n\u201cMy remark regarding the inclusion of transgender models in the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show came across as insensitive.

Honestly, I really hope that a transgender model will make the show soon. I admire and respect their journey to embrace who they really are.\u201d\n\nSo far, many business groups have made cost-free political alliances with transgender advocates, usually via the companies\u2019 long-standing support of gay advocacy groups. But some companies \u2014 notably Target \u2014 have suffered badly when their customers resist the company\u2019s imposition of pro-transgender ideology on their preferences. RuPaul, a gay activist, has also been slammed for excluding transgender people from his televised mockery of heterosexual Americans.\n\nIn the Victoria\u2019s Secret dispute, Razek created a backlash by explaining the brand\u2019s business case for avoiding transgender advocacy.\n\nThe progressive complaints aimed at Razek and the brand were personal, aggrieved and did not include any business arguments for changing the brand\u2019s image.\n\nMic.com suggested Razek is just like President Donald Trump:\n\nDoubling down on the hateful speech, Razek used the justification of the show being \u201cfantasy\u201d to excuse the lack of casting of transgender models (whom he called \u201ctranssexuals,\u201d a term that is often but not always considered pejorative). \u201cShouldn\u2019t you have transsexuals in the show? No. No, I don\u2019t think we should,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, why not? Because the show is a fantasy. It\u2019s a 42-minute entertainment special. That\u2019s what it is.\u201d This was a powerful white man \u2014 caught on the record \u2014 asserting a disregard for truth and an unflappable arrogance toward the livelihood of other human beings. Sound familiar?\n\nIn reality, Trump is using his authority to clarify that the sex of people involved in sex-discrimination legal fights will be based on their male or female body, not on their claimed \u201cgender identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m doing? I\u2019m protecting everybody,\u201d Trump said October 22. \u201cWe have a lot of different concepts right now. They have a lot of different things happening with respect to transgender, right now.\u201d\n\nJezebel covered the Razek statement by emphasizing the personal:\n\nThe 70-year-old Razek, who is part of the casting team that chooses the models for each show, gave some bizarrely out-of-touch answers in the interview, lambasting critics as being \u201chaters\u201d who want too much diversity in the show and describing trans models as \u201ctransexuals.\u201d He comes off as a complete joke and absolute asshole and is clearly the reason the company is stuck in 2005.\n\nMen who live as women used Twitter to make their voice heard:\n\nThis is for all my trans friends and cisgender women friends that are average or plus sized rather than support the bigoted Victoria Secret 8 Transgender-Friendly Lingerie Brands to Support Instead of Victoria's Secret \u2013 Teen Vogue https://t.co/ACNnEE19Iw \u2014 Vanessa Denise Capella (@SexnerdsVanessa) November 12, 2018\n\nFantasy can be whatever you want it to be and if that intentionally doesn't include trans women, then that's your prejudice talking.

In 2017, Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency. Multiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology\u2019s claim that a person\u2019s legal sex is determined by their feeling of \u201cgender identity,\u201d not by biology.\n\nThe transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have different goals and priorities.\n\nIt includes sexual liberationists, progressives, feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes, and people who glamorize the distinctions between the two sexes. It includes high-profile children, people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex, and people trying to \u201cdetransition\u201d back to their sex, men who demand sex from lesbians, masculine autogynephiles, wealthy donors, politicians, political professionals, and medical service providers.\n\nTransgender advocates claim that 2 million Americans say they are transgender, to a greater or lesser extent. But very few people who describe themselves as transgender undergo cosmetic surgery of the genitals. Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study.\n\nYet the gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies. In Ohio, for example, in February, a judge forced parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she can begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that will allow her to appear as a male.\n\nThe progressive push to bend Americans\u2019 attitudes and their male and female civic society around the idea of \u201cgender identity\u201d has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules that help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.\n\nThese pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents\u2019 rights in childrearing, children\u2019s safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women\u2019s ideals of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men\u2019s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children\u2019s sexual privacy.", "A damning report into the protection of Britain\u2019s seaports, harbours, and marinas has revealed that the country\u2019s border is \u201cnot secured by any stretch of the imagination\u201d.\n\nChief Inspector of Borders and Immigration David Bolt, who previously revealed that the Home Office had \u201clost\u201d some 56,000 migrants scheduled for deportation, including around 700 ex-cons, has published an official report describing an underresourced Border Force.\n\nThe government body is reported to be struggling to cope, as illegal migrants shift their focus from the Port of Dover crossing to others such as Newhaven, Portsmouth, Southampton, Poole, Plymouth and other, smaller points of entry, increasingly accessed via ports in Normandy and even Spain, rather than their former launchpad of Calais.\n\nBolt\u2019s report said officers had \u201ctold inspectors that there were not enough of them to meet increasing operational pressures, and one group commented that \u2018the border is not secured by any stretch of the imagination\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe said that officers felt that they were \u201cresourced to fail\u201d \u2014 and that they were \u201ccertain\u201d illegal migrants were aware of this and took it into consideration when making their attempts on the border.\n\n\u201c[T]heir intel is a lot better than ours,\u201d they complained.\n\nUK \u2018Loses\u2019 56,000 Migrants Due for Deportation, Including Over 700 Ex-Cons https://t.co/WOHRVImLCE \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 3, 2017\n\n\u201cI recognise that Border Force is dealing with many challenges, not just along the south coast but nationally, and that its job is not made any easier by having to prepare for the UK\u2019s exit from the EU without clarity as yet about what exactly this will involve,\u201d Bolt conceded.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is difficult to escape the impression that Border Force believes it knows best and will make changes only on its own terms and at its own pace.\u201d\n\nIndeed, while the Home Office\u2019s official response to the report\u2019s recommendations shows they appear to have \u2018Accepted\u2019 or \u2018Partially Accepted\u2019 all of them, a closer reading of the text appears implies they are simply describing or defending the actions already being taken or already in place \u2014 with specific recommendations that coastal patrol vessels\u2019 time at sea should be increased being rejected as \u201cnot\u2026 a measure of operational effectiveness\u201d, for example.\n\nLeave.EU Campaign Sneaks 'Migrants' Into UK To Highlight Porous Borders https://t.co/YhdDIFSwBs pic.twitter.com/5XW0Fm5s3h \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 22, 2016\n\n\u201cThe Independent Chief Inspector of Border and Immigration in the report of his inspection of south coast ports has pointed to evidence that would-be illegal migrants once in camps around Calais and Dunkirk have shifted their focus to ferry ports in Normandy and Spain, with an increase in attempts at clandestine entry into the UK via south coast ports like Poole and Portsmouth,\u201d remarked Migration Watch UK vice-chairman Alp Mehmet.\n\n\u201cThis is worrying.

You can not violate any sanctions that do not apply to us.\u201d\n\nThe Finance Minister\u2019s adversarial position comes after French President Emmanuel Macron said last week that the EU needs its own army to \u201cprotect\u201d itself from \u201cChina, Russia and even the United States of America.\u201d\n\nMacron has joined the ranks of Eurocrats Guy Vehofstadt MEP and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in calling for deeper EU integration which could eventually lead to a United States of Europe.", "The Swedish Employment Service is facing heavy criticism over a new optimistic report on the employment of new migrants, with critics pointing out that the only growth has been in jobs heavily subsidized by the government.\n\nThe new report claimed a large surge in newly arrived migrants enrolling in studies or finding employment, up from 32 percent in 2017 to 44 percent this year but critics have slammed the report as all of the growth is tied to government-funded programmes rather than private enterprise, SVT reports.\n\nAnna Dahlberg, political editor of Swedish newspaper Expressen criticised the report saying, \u201cTo call it a big success is directly misleading,\u201d and added that while it was clear that the Swedish Employment Service had a difficult task given the educational and skill level of some migrants, as well as their knowledge of Swedish, the report should not try to paint a better picture of the actual situation.\n\nThe figures for migrants finding work without government aid remain small with only 4 percent in some form of study and 7 percent gaining employment, unchanged from the previous year.\n\nWhile the foreign-born unemployment rate has seen a slight decline as well, it remains much higher than the native Swedish rate at 19.9 percent https://t.co/QZ3npY9R1w \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 16, 2018\n\nDirector General of the Employment Service Mikael Sj\u00f6berg defended the report saying, \u201cOne must be able to see that the results of the establishment program are getting better, but at the same time we face major challenges. But it is important to be aware that things are going well.\u201d\n\nThe unemployment rate of native Swedes compared to migrants has differed greatly for years, with Swedes having a much lower rate of unemployment. According to a report from last year, the unemployment rate for Swedes stood at a mere 3.9 percent compared to the 21.8 percent rate for migrant arrivals.\n\nEarlier this year it was revealed that overall unemployment had declined across the country but the gap between native Swedes and migrants still remained high with migrant unemployment at 19.9 percent.\n\nThe unemployment situation has also been clearly seen in the heavily migrant populated city of Malm\u00f6 where the unemployment rate was double the national average, according to a report from August.", "First Lady Melania Trump was ready for the cover of French Vogue from the minute she left the White House for her and President Donald Trump\u2019s Paris, France, weekend getaway to the time she returned.\n\nWhen Melania Trump departed the White House for Paris, she stepped out in a black, white, and grey checkered Burberry coat and a Christian Louboutin black calf, knee-high leather boots. The boots, which feature a slightly pointed toe, retail for about $1,295.\n\nAs with most of Mrs. Trump\u2019s overseas wardrobe collections, she often hints at her next ensemble in the preceding one. Before donning the Burberry coat, she had worn a series of plaid coats, chosen by her close confidant and style adviser Herv\u00e9 Pierre.\n\nIf the Burberry checkered coat and Louboutins were any indication of what was to come, it was that Mrs. Trump would stick to a list of luxurious, Parisian essentials: Greys, blacks, and deep navys, Louboutins, and coats galore.\n\nOf course, Mrs. Trump does not merely land in the same outfit she takes off in. Where\u2019s the fun in that? Her first step off Air Force One in Paris, Mrs. Trump donned a classy Dolce and Gabbana coat, more slick black Louboutin stilettos (I\u2019d love to see her shoe closet!), and wait for it \u2026 a crocodile Herm\u00e8s \u201cBirkin\u201d bag that likely retails for upwards of $25,000. We\u2019ll come to see that Birkin bag again, don\u2019t worry.\n\nAnother hint in this look: Mrs. Trump would be wearing black and Louboutins the following day. She likes to keep onlookers on their fashion toes. And who can blame her? When all eyes are on you, why not take advantage of the moment.\n\nThe next morning, Mrs. Trump arrived at the Elysee Palace in Paris to meet France\u2019s First Lady, Brigitte Macron. As her feet hit the gravel, Mrs. Trump was wearing the snakeskin black Louboutin pumps she had worn the night before.\n\nThis time, though, they were paired with a Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s look that Audrey Hepburn would be envious of. A Bottega Veneta dress in a deep, deep navy that almost appeared black, and a French twist (How fitting!) were the main focal points of this picturesque moment.\n\nMrs. Trump added in new touches with a pair of shimmering earrings \u2014 she hardly ever wears earrings \u2014 and a pair of black leather gloves. Not only do the gloves serve a function of keeping the Slovenian-born model\u2019s hands from freezing in the French cold, but they will become the key to the rest of her Paris wardrobe and likely the most coveted winter accessory of the season.\n\nThat evening, Mrs. Trump took a left turn. A dress and French twist were fitting for the day. So why not shock in a black and white Gorgio Armani tuxedo and pin straight hair?!\n\nThe most beautiful woman in a room of global diplomats and their wives in a menswear-inspired, androgynous fashion statement. That is the very definition of style. You must be born with this level of taste, it cannot be taught or learned.\n\nThe next day, it was raining in Paris and Mrs. Trump needed to be at Versailles to meet Mrs. Macron for a ceremony commemorating the end of World War I. For this, she figured if you can\u2019t beat the rain, make the rain a backdrop for the fashion photography that you are creating.\n\nThus, Mrs. Trump arrived in a grey Dior dress from the brand\u2019s Fall 2018 Pre-Fall collection (Very Thom Browne-esque) and a Dior grey coat draped over her shoulders. On her feet were subtle, black Manolo Blahniks \u2014 the red soles of Louboutin\u2019s would have been far too fussy for this look \u2014 and on her hands are, once again, those fabulous leather gloves.\n\nAs if the ensemble was not enough to make your jaw drop, Mrs. Trump took one of the gloves off to hold a black umbrella over her head. Paris in the rain! (GASP!) The images look more like an Annie Leibovitz French Vogue photo shoot than a global meeting of leaders.\n\nThat night, Mrs. Trump and the president were due back in Washington, D.C. Of course, Mrs. Trump was not going to arrive back home in the Dior ensemble she had worn at Versailles. That look is now precious to that occasion, it can only be worn once.\n\nBut, who said she can\u2019t reduce the Dior look to a Celine-style minimalism, taking some of the most underrated components of her Paris wardrobe and highlighting them as she walks across the White House lawn. After all, Mrs. Trump has been dropping hints of what is to come next this entire trip.\n\nSo Mrs. Trump landed in Washington and walked off Air Force One in nothing else but the grey Dior coat she had covered her shoulders with earlier in the day, those leather gloves, the Manolo Blahnik stilettos, and added \u2014 you guessed it! \u2014 the crocodile Herm\u00e8s Birkin bag.\n\nMen often forget that fashion is much like sports. You always finish with a bang. Luckily for us, Mrs. Trump understands this.", "Police in the Chicago suburb of Midlothian allegedly shot and killed a security guard who had stopped a bar shooting and was holding a suspect at gunpoint.\n\nWGN reports that a group of men was asked to leave Manny\u2019s Blue Room Bar in Robbins, IL, at about 4 a.m. Sunday.

Doug Jones (D-AL) narrowly defeated embattled GOP nominee Roy Moore.\n\nAt first glance, the odds in favor of a Democrat victory would appear improbable.\n\nPresident Trump easily defeated Hillary Clinton in Mississippi in 2016 by 18 points, 58 percent to 40 percent.\n\nIt has been 36 years since the state last elected a Democrat to the United States Senate in 1982, when incumbent Sen. John Stennis (D-MS) was re-elected to his seventh and final term.\n\nBut some level of trouble is on the horizon for the GOP, and the Democrats are looking to capitalize on it.\n\nIn the three-way election to complete the remaining two years of Sen.

Phil Bryant to the seat in April after Cochran\u2019s resignation, finished in first place with 41 percent, Espy finished in second place with 40 percent, and State Senator Chris McDaniel, the Tea Party favorite who narrowly lost the 2014 GOP runoff primary election to Cochran, finished in third with 16 percent.\n\nUnder Mississippi law, candidates must receive more than 50 percent of the vote to be declared the winner. If any candidate fails to win 50 percent in the general election, the top two finishers face each other in a runoff election three weeks later.\n\nThough Hyde-Smith is favored to win the runoff, her campaign ran into turbulence late Sunday after a comment she made on the campaign trail was posted on Twitter and her opponent quickly jumped on it, as Politico reported:\n\nSen.

In referencing the one who invited me, I used an exaggerated expression of regard, and any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous.\n\nOn Monday, Gov.

Fontes was a strong supporter both publicly and financially, of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 run for president in 2016. He has been criticized in the 2018 midterm elections for handling of ballots where voter information didn\u2019t match. Several county Republican parties filed a lawsuit against all Arizona county vote recorders and the Arizona Secretary of State last week over the methods used to verify those questionable ballots. A judge determined Friday that recorders would have until Wednesday, a week following the election, to verify those votes.\n\nMichelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News \u2014 follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook", "Pope Francis has temporarily suspended efforts by the United States bishops to address the issue of clerical sex abuse, ordering them to wait until he can meet with them in February together with the presidents of other national bishops\u2019 conferences from around the world.\n\nThe U.S. bishops are currently gathered in Baltimore, Maryland, for their annual fall meeting, which was to focus on dealing with the sex abuse crisis. During the opening session of the meeting Monday morning, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, the president of the bishops\u2019 conference (USCCB), informed the assembly that he had been contacted by the Holy See on Sunday afternoon with instructions not to move forward with a vote on several concrete measures to respond to the abuse crisis.\n\nOn announcing the news, Cardinal DiNardo expressed his \u201cdisappointment\u201d with the decision. Since last August, DiNardo has been insisting that the Vatican initiate a formal investigation into the case of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick\u2019s serial homosexual abuse, a request that was ultimately denied after DiNardo traveled to Rome to present his petition to Pope Francis.\n\n\u201cAt the insistence of the Holy See, we will not be voting on the two action items in our docket regarding the abuse crisis,\u201d DiNardo said Monday.\n\n\u201cWe are not, ourselves, happy about this,\u201d DiNardo said during a press conference. \u201cWe have been working hard to get to the action stage, and we\u2019ll do it, but we have to get past this bump in the road.\u201d\n\nThe measures proposed by the USCCB included a code of conduct for bishops, the creation of a lay commission to address the abuse issue and the McCarrick case, a third-party hotline to report bishops accused of abuse or mishandling of abuse cases, and \u201cprotocols for bishops resigned or removed because of abuse.\u201d\n\nPope Francis had initially suggested that the bishops suspend their fall meeting altogether, replacing it with a weeklong silent prayer retreat. The bishops opted to continue forward with the meeting, including days reserved for prayer as well.\n\nIn explaining the pope\u2019s decision, the Vatican ambassador to the United States, Archbishop Christophe Pierre, said that Francis is concerned about \u201ccommunion,\u201d wanting the whole Church to move together rather than having national bishops\u2019 conferences make their own policies.\n\nOddly, Pope Francis has often spoken of the need for decentralization, encouraging local churches to take more initiative in addressing pastoral issues because, in many areas of church life, one size does not fit all. In dealing with clerical sex abuse, however, this is apparently not the case.\n\nWhen asked about this apparent contradiction, Cardinal DiNardo said it was \u201cquizzical.\u201d\n\nIn August, a former Vatican nuncio to the United States accused a number of high-ranking prelates \u2014 including the pope himself \u2014 of culpable mishandling of the McCarrick case, declaring that Francis had known about McCarrick\u2019s crimes and sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict XVI and yet reinstated him to a position of influence in the Vatican.\n\nThe pope has refused to confirm or deny the allegations made in the report, including the question of when he learned of McCarrick\u2019s history of abuse.\n\nPope Francis went on to call out the former nuncio, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2, comparing him to Satan. Days later, the pope said that pastors accused of misconduct are like Jesus on Good Friday, who responded with silence to the accusations laid against him.\n\nAnne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, called the last-minute order from the Vatican \u201ctruly incredible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we see here is the Vatican again trying to suppress even modest progress by the U.S. bishops,\u201d said Doyle. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing where the problem lies, which is with the Vatican.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe outcome of this meeting, at best, was going to be tepid and ineffectual, but now it\u2019s actually going to be completely without substance,\u201d she said.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

There was nobody more essential to carrying out the promises that Trump made to voters than Jeff Sessions. The main reason was elected, I think, is that people were simply fed up with the decimation of the immigration rule of law and the sense that our immigration policy was being made on a de facto basis by people living outside of the country rather than Americans. [Emphasis added] And Jeff Sessions has spent a lifetime documenting how unchecked, mass, low-skilled immigration destroys the social fabric of this country. He knew what the Left had done \u2014 where the bodies were buried so to speak \u2014 within the federal bureaucracy and he set out to systematically recover the rule of law. [Emphasis added] The prosecution, he broke the record for prosecution for illegal entry into the country, the prosecution of deported illegals who re-entered was up 38 percent.He set out to try to finally bring coherence and justice to the outrageous sanctuary city movement whereby local jurisdictions try to thumb their nose at federal authority when the federal government is trying to deport illegal alien criminals. He tried to withdraw funding from those cities. He was sued right and left \u2026 left-wing judges doing the bidding of left-wing mayors. [Emphasis added]\n\nAs Breitbart News noted, despite constant attacks from Trump and beltway conservatives, Sessions remained a steady fighter against the open borders lobby and big business interests, ending former President Obama\u2019s asylum loopholes and prosecuting multiples businesses that were found to have hired foreign workers over qualified American citizens.\n\nMac Donald also said she has \u201cno confidence\u201d that the president will stop being advised by his daughter, Ivanka Trump, on the issue of immigration.\n\n\u201cI have no confidence that Trump will resist the demands of his daughter, who was very instrumental during the PR, ginned up family separation crisis this summer that resulted from Jeff Sessions\u2019 determination to end Catch and Release at the border,\u201d Mac Donald continued. \u201cTo end the exploitation and distortion of our asylum laws.
