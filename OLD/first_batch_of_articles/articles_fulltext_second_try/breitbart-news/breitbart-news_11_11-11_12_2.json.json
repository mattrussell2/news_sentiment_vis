["Victor Davis Hanson told Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow on Monday\u2019s edition of SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Daily that French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s proposal for a European Union army is \u201cabsurd,\u201d noting France\u2019s failure to meet its financial commitments to NATO.\n\nHanson reflected on Macron\u2019s Sunday remarks at the centennial commemoration of World War I\u2019s armistice in Paris, France, where the French leader said, \u201cPatriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism: Nationalism is treason.\u201d\n\nHanson said, \u201cI was kind of shocked, because here the host was taking the occasion to pose as Europe\u2019s next leader by basically attacking not only Eastern European leaders, but Trump with his nationalist point, and then framing a hyper-fascist nationalist like Petain, who not only, you could argue about his behavior in World War I, good and bad, but he was the leader of French fascist nationalism in World War II, and yet Macron, historically illiterate, starts to praise him while he\u2019s attacking Trump.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nHanson continued, \u201cAnd then [Emmanuel Macron] adds insult to injury by talking about, on the eve of the trip, how he\u2019s going to create a European Union army, and it\u2019s going to be used to protect France and Europe from not just China and Russia, but the United States, and yet he wants the United States to come over and commemorate coming in World War I and saving France, and by extension World War II, and by extension the Cold War, and yet he and the Germans can\u2019t even spend the two percent [of their GDP] towards NATO, and yet they\u2019re talking about an additional army. So the entire thing is absurd.\u201d\n\nHanson added, \u201cIt\u2019s what French leaders always do when their popularity is down in the 20s, which is where Macron\u2019s is.\u201d\n\nHanson examined historical lessons to be drawn from World War I\u2019s armistice and the lead-up to World War II.\n\n\u201c[Woodrow Wilson] ended up a tragic figure,\u201d assessed Hanson. \u201cHe missed one central point: When you\u2019re a wartime figure, you have to put your national interest first, and you have to ensure victory, and humiliation, and the defeat of your enemy before you talk about peace. He talked about peace first and victory second. That didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nHanson examined the failures of global governance structures such as the League of Nations and United Nations (U.N.) in maintaining peace between nations.\n\nHanson stated, \u201cThe League of Nations was a complete failure. Remember, the Italians went in and just slaughtered the Ethiopians, and the British and the French had the two largest fleets in the Mediterranean, and all they had to do was stop the Italians from going through the Suez Canal. They could\u2019ve blown up every Italian ship with troops in them, and they would have never been able to get into East Africa, and yet they didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nHanson went on, \u201cChina was attacked by Japan as early as 1932 and 1933, and the League of Nations could have stopped that. Japan had essentially no oil, and Holland and the Netherlands controlled the Dutch facilities next door, and we were an oil exporter, and yet we did nothing. The idea that the League of Nations failed because the United States didn\u2019t participate is kind of crazy.\u201d\n\nHanson warned against subversion of national sovereignty to international institutions such as the U.N.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a good record of international conferences keeping the peace,\u201d noted Hanson. \u201cWhat keeps the peace is that countries that are democratic and have constitutional government are well-armed, and they deter bad actors, and say, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t do what you want to do, because if you do a cost-benefit analysis you\u2019re going to pay a terrible price.\u2019 But when you lose that, you always lose that when you chop up or outsource your national security to something like the League of Nations or the U.N.\u201d\n\nHanson added, \u201cThen you get somebody who\u2019s pretty weak \u2014 Hitler in the late 30s, or Mussolini, or the Japanese government, and then later Tojo \u2014 they were pretty weak compared to the potential of the British Empire or the United States and the Western democracies in Europe, but they didn\u2019t feel they were weak because they looked at appeasement and isolationism and they thought, \u2018Wow, it\u2019s going to be easy to pick off this low-hanging fruit.\u2019 And it was until 1942.\u201d\n\nHanson cautioned against irresponsible benevolence via statecraft in wartime.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous to go in and defeat an enemy, and then to take your foot off his neck, so to speak, out of this false sense of magnanimity and humanitarianism, because once you do that, a lot of innocent people are going to get killed,\u201d noted Hanson.\n\nHanson advised, \u201cSo if you want to go to war, you have to defeat the enemy, and you have to occupy his territory. You have to change his government, or at least change his mindset. We haven\u2019t learned that lesson. We\u2019re still dealing with the aftermath of the Korean War which also had an armistice and was not a surrender.\u201d\n\nHanson also examined left-wing news media hostility towards President Donald Trump.\n\nHanson said, \u201cNow, with this 7-billion-person mob, and they don\u2019t know much about the past, they feel that they can just instantly serve as sort of a French revolutionary guillotine mob in the streets of Paris, and so it\u2019s instant thumbs up or down, and I think that\u2019s lost all perspective about Trump.\u201d\n\nHanson added, \u201c[Donald Trump] didn\u2019t say, \u2018Get in the their faces,\u2019 or \u2018Bring a gun to a knife fight,\u2019 or \u2018Punish our enemies,\u2019 or at least Melania didn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019ve never been proud of this country,\u2019 or \u2018the United States is a downright mean country.'\u201d\n\nHanson concluded, \u201cThe idea that everything was normal until Trump came along is just a historical fallacy. For the media, there\u2019s something about [Donald Trump\u2019s] class, his accent, his appearance, his speech, and his background that they find antithetical to their whole notion of what a president should be, and they react accordingly.\u201d\n\nHanson is a professor of Greek and director of the classics program at California State University in Fresno, CA.

With ISIS\u2019s declaration of an east Asia wilayah, the southern Philippines becomes more important because there is enough ungoverned or very poorly governed space.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are ISIS cells in Malaysia and Singapore, but they don\u2019t control any territory,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can\u2019t be [a] province of the caliphate without territory.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the fall of the group\u2019s so-called caliphate in Iraq and Syria has also prompted \u201can unprecedented number of Europeans, including those from the UK, Spain, Germany, and Switzerland\u201d to attempt to travel to join ISIS in the Philippines this year, the Guardian revealed.\n\n\u201cForeign fighters are in the Philippines because they consider the country, particularly Mindanao, as a safe haven, alternative home base and a new land of jihad,\u201d Banlaoi said.\n\n\u201cThey train and learn from local fighters. They provide funds. They provide a global support network,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe Guardian warned of continued support for ISIS among local Muslims in Mindanao, home to the five-month siege by the Filipino army to retake Marawi from the jihadist group in October 2017, a successful offensive that left more than 1,000 people dead.\n\nSidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, told the Guardian, \u201cThe risk of violence continues to be very high, more from local pro-Isis elements.\u201d\n\nAlthough \u201cISIS-Philippines (ISIS-P) remained fragmented and degraded\u201d and \u201chas not controlled any territory since its defeat in that conflict, various factions [linked to the terrorist group] carried out opportunistic acts of violence against civilians and security personnel,\u201d the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) IG noted in a press release announcing a report issued last Monday.\n\nThe IG acknowledged that \u201cthe group has been without a unified leadership or command structure since the end of the 2017 siege of Marawi\u201d when the Philippine military killed the leaders of the nation\u2019s two ISIS affiliates \u2014 Isnilon Hapilon of Abu Sayyaf and Omar Maute of the Maute group.\n\nThe Guardian noted that the old and new ISIS arrivals on the Christian-majority island nation are trying to want re-establish the east Asia wilayah (or East Asia ISIS province) crushed by the Filipino army in October 2017.\n\nIn 2018, the Pentagon spent more than $100 million on Operation Pacific Eagle \u2013 Philippines (OPE-P), the official mission in support of the island nation\u2019s efforts against ISIS. There are 250 U.S. troops supporting the OPE-P mission.", "White House counselor Kellyanne Conway had four words to say when she read a Sunday op-ed in the Wall Street Journal predicting that Hillary Clinton would make another run for the presidency in 2020.\n\n\u201cDear God, please, yes,\u201d Conway tweeted Sunday evening:\n\nClinton ran for president twice already, losing once in the 2008 Democratic primary to former President Barack Obama and a second time to President Donald Trump in the 2016 general presidential election.\n\nBut former Clinton operative Mark Penn seemed to think Clinton has one more run left in her, making the case in the Wall Street Journal for Clinton to run for the presidency a third time.\n\nConway, President Trump\u2019s final campaign manager who was the first woman to be in charge of a winning presidential campaign, took pleasure in telling the Daily Mail on election night in 2016 that she was the woman to \u201cbreak the glass ceiling\u201d instead of Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe White House counselor also commented on Clinton\u2019s re-emergence in the political arena in 2017, calling it a telling sign that Democrats had \u201cno game\u201d and were operating without a leader.", "PARADISE, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The death toll from the wildfire that incinerated Paradise and surrounding areas climbed to 31 \u2014 matching the mark for the deadliest single blaze in California history \u2014 as crews continued searching for bodies in the smoldering ruins, with nearly 230 people unaccounted for.\n\nStatewide the number of dead stood at 31, including two victims in Southern California, from wildfires raging at both ends of the state.\n\nTen search teams were working in Paradise \u2014 a town of 27,000 that was engulfed by flames Thursday \u2014 and in surrounding communities in Northern California\u2019s Sierra Nevada foothills. Authorities called in a DNA lab and anthropologists to help identify what in some cases were only bones or bone fragments.\n\nAll told, more 8,000 firefighters battled wildfires that scorched more than 325 square miles (840 square kilometers) of the state, with the flames feeding on dry brush and driven by winds that had a blowtorch effect.\n\n\u201cThis is truly a tragedy that all Californians can understand and respond to,\u201d Gov. Jerry Brown said Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s a time to pull together and work through these tragedies.\u201d\n\nCalifornia is requesting emergency aid from the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has blamed what he called poor forest management for the fires.\n\nThe governor said that the federal and state governments must do more forest management but that climate change is the greater source of the problem.\n\n\u201cAnd those who deny that are definitely contributing to the tragedies that we\u2019re now witnessing and will continue to witness in the coming years,\u201d Brown said.\n\nDrought and warmer weather attributed to climate change, and the building of homes deeper into forests have led to longer and more destructive wildfire seasons in California. While California officially emerged from a five-year drought last year, much of the northern two-thirds of the state is abnormally dry.\n\nIn Southern California, firefighters beat back a new round of winds Sunday and the fire\u2019s spread was believed to have been largely stopped, though extremely low humidity and gusty Santa Ana winds were in the forecast through at least Tuesday.\n\nSome of the thousands of people forced from their homes were allowed to return, and authorities reopened U.S. 101, a major freeway through the fire zone in Los Angeles and Ventura counties.\n\nMalibu celebrities and mobile-home dwellers in nearby mountains were slowly learning whether their homes had been spared or reduced to ash. Two people were killed in Malibu, and the fire destroyed at least 370 or so structures, authorities said.\n\nThe fire grew to more than 143 square miles (370 square kilometers) and was only 20 percent contained.\n\nCelebrities whose coastal homes were damaged or destroyed or who were forced to flee expressed sympathy for the less famous and offered their gratitude to firefighters. Actor Gerard Butler said on Instagram that his Malibu home was \u201chalf-gone,\u201d adding he was \u201cinspired as ever by the courage, spirit and sacrifice of firefighters.\u201d\n\nIn Northern California, where more than 6,700 buildings have been destroyed in the blaze that obliterated Paradise, firefighters contended with wind gusts up to 40 mph (64 kph) overnight, the fire jumping 300 feet across Lake Oroville.\n\nThe state fire agency said Monday that the fire had grown to 177 square miles (303 square kilometers) and was 25 percent contained.\n\nThe magnitude of the devastation was beginning to set in even as the blaze raged on. Public safety officials toured the Paradise area to begin discussing the recovery. Much of what makes the city function was gone.\n\n\u201cParadise was literally wiped off the map,\u201d said Tim Aboudara, a fireighters union representative. He said at least 36 firefighters lost their own homes, most in the Paradise area.\n\nOthers continued the desperate search for friends or relatives, calling evacuation centers, hospitals, police and the coroner\u2019s office.\n\nSol Bechtold drove from shelter to shelter looking for his mother, Joanne Caddy, a 75-year-old widow whose house burned down along with the rest of her neighborhood in Magalia, just north of Paradise. She lived alone and did not drive.\n\nAs he drove through the smoke and haze to yet another shelter, he said, \u201cI\u2019m also under a dark emotional cloud.

The political climate on the Hill has turned hostile to Saudi Arabia over the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and the war in Yemen, the staffer said, adding that some Republican lawmakers who opposed suspending refueling now favor the move,\u201d NBC News pointed out.\n\nIn a rare show of bipartisanship, lawmakers from both parties have demanded that the U.S. stop weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and halt the refueling of warplanes flown by the coalition led by the Sunni kingdom, which watchdog groups have accused of killing thousands of unarmed civilians, the Post noted.\n\nSens. Todd C. Young (R-IN) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) renewed their calls for a suspension of U.S. refueling in the Yemen war, saying in a statement issued Friday, \u201cWe must send an unambiguous, immediate, and tangible message that we expect Riyadh to engage in good faith and urgent negotiations to end the civil war Riyadh must also understand that we will not tolerate the continued indiscriminate airstrikes against civilians and civilian infrastructure that have helped put 14 million Yemenis on the verge of starvation.\u201d\n\nAlthough anti-Yemen war lawmaker Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) welcomed the decision to end the refueling of Saudi coalition aircraft, Foreign Policy (FP) acknowledged that the move would not satisfy all critics of the conflict\n\nSecretary Mattis noted in his statement Friday:\n\nThe U.S. will also continue working with the Coalition and Yemen to minimize civilian casualties and expand urgent humanitarian efforts throughout the country. Recognizing continued bipartisan interest from Congress, the Administration is appreciative of the continued dialogue we have had with key members on this issue and look forward to working together to support the United Nations\u2019 ongoing efforts on this new phase in Yemen.\n\nSoon after WaPo reported the refueling decision, the Saudi and American governments confirmed the move.\n\n\u201cThe Kingdom and the Coalition has increased its capability to independently conduct in-flight refueling in Yemen. As a result, in consultation with the United States, the Coalition has requested cessation of in-flight refueling support for its operations in Yemen,\u201d Saudi Arabia said in a statement published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency (SPA) on Saturday.\n\nIt remains unclear what impact the move to stop refueling Saudi coalition aircraft will have on the overall war in Yemen, AP conceded, noting:\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear what impact the U.S. withdrawal from air refueling operations would have. American officials earlier said Saudi forces now handled some 80 percent of their refueling operations, which crucially allow aircraft to fly longer sorties over possible targets and can ease the pressure for quick strikes. Yet even with that refueling support, Saudi Arabia has faced widespread international criticism over its campaign of airstrikes in the coalition\u2019s war in Yemen, targeting Shiite rebels known as Houthis who hold the capital, Sanaa. Saudi strikes have hit public markets, hospitals, and other nonmilitary targets, killing scores of civilians.\n\nMattis and the U.S. State Department noted that the Trump administration is still pursuing peace in Yemen.\n\nBoth Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have called for an end to the war in Yemen.\n\nIn March 2015, a U.S.-backed Saudi Arabia Sunni coalition launched the ongoing offensive against the Iran-allied Houthis to restore the internationally-recognized government of Yemeni President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi back to power.", "The Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers wore gun control shirts during warm-ups, following last week\u2019s shooting in Thousand Oaks, California.\n\nThe shirts listed the names of the 12 victims who were shot and killed at Borderline Bar & Grill and the front of the shirts was emblazoned with \u201cEnough,\u201d the gun control mantra from Michael Bloomberg\u2019s Everytown for Gun Safety.\n\nEnough is #ENOUGH.

That is the requisite number of members she needs to publicly cast votes for her on the Floor if she wants to regain the speaker\u2019s gavel in the next Congress now that Democrats have retaken the House majority.\n\nPelosi, who served as speaker before Democrats lost the House to Republicans in the 2010 midterm elections in former President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, weathered the storms of her conference and stayed atop the Democrat Party in the House for eight long years as House minority leader awaiting the return of Democrats to power. Now that the Democrats have regained the majority in the House in November\u2019s midterm elections, a new majority will be seated in early January at the end of this current Congress, and Pelosi is the only declared candidate for speaker.\n\nBut just like her immediate successor, Republican and former Speaker John Boehner found out the hard way after three years of coup attempts by conservatives, the final of which was eventually successful in mid-2015, Pelosi needs to hold together at least 218 votes from a rambunctious and very divided conference with a diversity of viewpoints on everything from whether Democrats should impeach President Donald Trump to how Democrats should handle policy on matters like taxation, immigration, trade, national security, and more.\n\nFor now, Pelosi\u2019s biggest strength in pushing herself to become speaker again is that her intra-party opponents\u2013per Politico\u2013cannot find a viable, or even plausible, candidate to rally around in opposition to her. \u201cThe House Democratic rebels trying to keep Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker have a big problem: They can\u2019t seem to find someone to run against her,\u201d Politico\u2018s Rachael Bade and John Bresnahan wrote on Monday.\n\nBut, in the very next paragraph, Bade and Bresnahan broke this big tidbit: Pelosi\u2019s Democrat opponents in the House say they have the votes to stop her from regaining the speakership.\n\n\u201cThe naysayers claim they have the 15 to 20 votes it would take to block Pelosi on the House floor,\u201d Bade and Bresnahan wrote. \u201cBut so far, no one\u2019s stepped up as an alternative, and it\u2019s unclear who might. Also unknown is whether that person would have a prayer against the experienced Pelosi, as flawed as her detractors say she is.\u201d\n\nWhen all is said and done from last Tuesday\u2019s midterms\u2013there are still nine outstanding House races\u2013Democrats could have a majority as high as 236 seats but definitely will have at least 227. That final number is going to be critical for Democrats\u2019 hopes of securing Pelosi as speaker, as every number extra that Democrats add to the final total is an extra vote Pelosi can afford to lose.\n\nIf Republicans sweep those nine remaining races, a very unlikely outcome, and Democrats enter the new Congress with 227 votes, Pelosi can only afford to lose nine Democrats on the floor. Democrats, however, are very likely to pick up a number of the nine outstanding seats. They currently lead Republicans in four of them: California\u2019s 10th District, New Jersey\u2019s 3rd District, New York\u2019s 22nd, and Utah\u2019s 4th District. Republicans lead Democrats in the other five: California\u2019s 39th and 45th Districts, and Georgia\u2019s 7th, as well as Maine\u2019s 2nd, and Texas\u2019s 23rd Districts.\n\nIf these races are finalized the way they stand now, Democrats will have 231 votes in the House\u2013which means Pelosi can afford to lose 13 Democrats in her bid for the speakership\u2013but if they all go to the Democrats in the end, Democrats would have 236 votes, and Pelosi would be able to afford to lose 18 votes from Democrats in the speaker\u2019s race.\n\nIn other words, depending on how these final races shake out, Pelosi\u2019s margin for error could be anywhere from nine to eighteen votes; the higher the number, the harder it is for the intra-conference rebels to successfully block her.\n\nOne place where anti-Pelosi Democrat rebels could learn from anti-Boehner GOP rebels from a few years ago is strategy when it comes to stopping a presumed speaker. There were three coups against Boehner, the first two nearly successful but ultimately failed, and the third one successful.\n\nFirst and foremost, despite Pelosi\u2019s allies pushing the narrative that a challenger to her must emerge, that is not true. They can vote her down, and then most certainly after she would have failed to reach 218 votes on the first ballot on the House floor, then plausible challengers would emerge. The way a speakership vote works is at the beginning of any Congress, the newly sworn-in members must elect a speaker. Candidates are declared\u2013usually just the leader of each party\u2013and then roll is called, and each member\u2019s name is called out, in alphabetical order, and the members vote for either candidate or for an undeclared candidate.\n\nMembers can vote for anyone eligible for the speakership, and that does not mean they need to cast votes for a sitting member of the House. In fact, some of the GOP rebels against Boehner in different cases voted for people like Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY) or Jeff Sessions (R-AL). Some even voted for former Rep. Allen West (R-FL).\n\nAssuming all 435 members of the House vote\u2013and vote for a person, not \u201cpresent\u201d\u2013then the winning candidate would need 218 votes to take the speakership. Voting \u201cpresent\u201d cancels the vote caster\u2019s vote, as it means the vote is not counted toward the larger total and lowers the threshold required for a candidate to win. Another talking point likely to emerge from the Pelosi camp\u2013an inaccurate one that Boehner\u2019s allies pushed to try to protect him\u2013is that doing this, voting for someone other than Pelosi, could hand the speakership back to the other party. This is not true. A winning candidate must receive a majority of votes cast for a candidate (declared or undeclared), so if Pelosi fails to get to that majority on the Floor, the speakership race would go to a second ballot\u2013and it is there or on later ballots, as it keeps going until someone wins, that presumably any true challenger with an actual chance at winning would emerge.\n\nSo if the Democrats\u2019 anti-Pelosi rebels want to actually win, they can\u2013by just getting at least anywhere from 9 to 18 votes from House Democrats for someone other than Pelosi. After denying her the speakership on the first ballot, they can allow whoever their candidate is to emerge\u2013or they can force all sorts of horse-trading on changes in leadership structure in the party or a debate between candidates, or basically anything else they want to happen, and withhold their votes from a weakened Pelosi beholden to them until such time as they are good and ready to either vote for her or vote for someone else.\n\nAnother thing anti-Pelosi Democrats can learn from the last generation of rebels is the need to be public with one\u2019s intentions before the vote comes down. If they have the numbers, as Politico reports they say they do, they need their members to issue public statements announcing their intentions to vote against Pelosi and for someone new.\n\nThe first coup attempt against Boehner, in early 2013, was a closely-held, secretive plan that did not involve much public interaction. The second coup attempt, in early 2015, was much more public; many members had said they would not vote for Boehner. But as Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) would recall after it failed, \u201cWe had enough votes, but people that were right there ready to go ended up deciding not to vote with us.\u201d\n\nIt is much easier for politicians to weasel out of a tough decision\u2013opposing the anointed leader of one\u2019s own party is easy to talk about in private, but to actually do it in public on television with the whole world watching is much tougher\u2013if they are not committed ahead of time. Most of those involved in the anti-Boehner coup efforts regret not having all the members involved publicly declare their intentions to oppose Boehner ahead of time; doing so would have made it very difficult to switch positions and also would have made it less of a shocker or surprise for the media and wider general public when they did do what they said they were going to do.\n\nPolitico\u2018s report on the anti-Pelosi rebels on Monday includes a huge bright spot for those Democrats who would like to see someone else as speaker: There is a \u201cleader\u201d of the movement, a sitting Democrat House member, quoted on record in the piece.

The indictments were returned on October 24, and unsealed on October 30, 2018.

As little as two milligrams of fentanyl can be a lethal dose, and the 20 kilograms of fentanyl seized in this case to date is enough to kill 10 million people\u2014more than one and a half times the population of Maryland,\u201d said Maryland U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur.\n\nThe DOJ declared the Sinaloa Cartel as one of its top-five transnational targets.

This is when Carlson confronted the man.\n\n\u201cToward the end of the meal, my 19-year-old daughter went to the bathroom with a friend,\u201d he writes. \u201cOn their way back through the bar, a middle-aged man stopped my daughter and asked if she was sitting with Tucker Carlson.\u201d\n\nAfter she told the man Carlson was her dad, Granados allegedly lashed out at her calling her a \u201cfucking cunt\u201d and asking, \u201cAre you Tucker\u2019s whore?\u201d\n\nCarlson\u2019s son left the table to confront Granados and after Granados admitted to calling her a \u201ccunt,\u201d Carlson writes, \u201cMy son threw a glass of red wine in the man\u2019s face and told him to leave the bar, which he soon did.\u201d\n\nTucker adds, \u201cI love my children. It took enormous self-control not to beat the man with a chair.\u201d\n\nAfter a three-week investigation, Tucker says, Granados had his membership revoked and was tossed from the country club.\n\nUntil Avenatti made the incident public and released the video, Carlson said he did not publicize the event because \u201cwas hoping to keep the incident private\u201d for the sake of his daughter.\n\nYou can read Carlson\u2019s full statement here.\n\nAvenatti, who is still reeling from how badly he botched his client\u2019s debunked assault allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh last month, represents Granados and is now threatening to pursue \u201cassault\u201d and \u201cunderage drinking\u201d charges against \u201cTucker and/or members of this inner circle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe anticipate charges being filed,\u201d he says.\n\nAll of this is happening just days after the left-wing terrorist group Antifa assaulted Carlson\u2019s home with threats shouted through a bullhorn and spray paint.

Experience shows that we have proceeded with our maritime trade over the past 40 years despite threats,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook warned last Wednesday that Iranian tankers are a \u201cfloating liability\u201d in waterways \u201cfrom the Suzel Canal to the Strait of Malacca and all choke points in between.\u201d\n\nAlthough Iranian media and officials appear to be taking Hook\u2019s comments as a threat to attack or seize the tankers, he explained that sanctions would force Iran to take out poorly-financed domestic insurance policies on their vessels, leaving port operators around the world on the hook for huge financial damages if the Iranians cause an accident.\n\n\u201cCountries, ports and canal operators and private firms should know they will be likely responsible for the costs of an accident involving a self-insured Iranian tanker,\u201d he warned.\n\nHook further noted Iranian aging ships become accident-prone because of the tactics they use to evade sanctions, such as turning off their location transponders.\n\n\u201cThese transponders are designed to maximize visibility at sea and turning them off only increases the risk of accidents and injuries. Self-insured Iranian tankers engaging in unsafe behavior, with many tons of crude oil on board, is courting environmental and financial disaster,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Iranians blame America for forcing them to resort to such measures and are reportedly preparing to file a complaint with the International Maritime Organization against \u201ccruel U.S. sanctions and restrictions on maritime transport.\u201d\n\nIranian First Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri claimed on Monday the United States is losing its showdown with Tehran.\n\n\u201cNo government has supported the US sanctions against Iran, except the Zionist regime and some regional governments,\u201d Jahangiri asserted, making a derogatory reference to Israel.\n\nHe said the Iranian government has \u201cdevised plans and solutions to minimize the impact of the sanctions and pressures on the country\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal argued on Monday that Iran sanctions are producing a windfall for supertanker operators, including a good deal of revenue for Iran\u2019s state-run tanker company, because oil shipments have been shuffled around so dramatically:\n\nA U.S. decision to grant waivers to eight countries that allow them to continue buying Iranian crude is softening the impact of the sanctions and providing needed revenue to state-run National Iranian Tanker Co., the country\u2019s flagship shipping company. Singapore and London brokers say around 65% of NITC tankers are moving oil cargoes to the countries with U.S. waivers, including China, India, Japan, South Korea, Italy, Turkey and Greece. These markets traditionally buy around 70% of Iran\u2019s oil exports. The White House wants the flow to wind down, but tanker brokers say that is unlikely to happen soon, as a halt could push oil prices to around $100 a barrel, potentially undermining U.S. economic growth. The brokers said more NITC ships could be used as other tanker operators stay clear of Iran, fearing punitive action by Washington. NITC owns 38 VLCCs out of a global fleet of 733, and several smaller tankers. The company didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nSome analysts noted the tanker industry generally has trouble turning a profit and the current revenue spike is a temporary \u201cdead cat bounce\u201d once seasonal demand subsides and the new shipping routes settle in.", "Many have been critical of Google\u2019s plan to launch a censored search engine in China, now a former Facebook executive has called out Google\u2019s CEO for lying about the company\u2019s motives.\n\nFacebook\u2019s former security chief Alex Stamos took to Twitter recently to attack Google CEO Sundar Pichai for his comments defending the company\u2019s decision to move into the China market with its censored search engine known as \u201cProject Dragonfly,\u201d Silicon Beat reports.\n\nIn a recent interview with the New York Times, Pichai stated that Google was \u201ccommitted to serving users in China\u201d and compared Chinese censorship laws to the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d law in the European Union.

To suppress protests by pro-democracy voices who note that Maduro has banned free and fair elections and illegally dissolved the legislature, the Venezuelan socialist regime has taken hundreds of political prisoners and killed and tortured many not imprisoned for extended periods of time. According to Lorent Saleh, a student activist who spent four years in prison for organizing peacefully, guards in Venezuelan prisoners actively tortured prisoners using sensory deprivation, sleep deprivation, beatings, extracting blood to weaken a prisoner, and crucifixion.\n\nIn neighboring Cuba, pro-democracy voices more often face public beatings and humiliation, as dictator Ra\u00fal Castro attempts to keep political prisoner statistics low to discredit human rights advocates. Cuba arrests hundreds of political activists every month, typically beating them and leaving them hours from home with no way of getting back. Some activists, like Ladies in White organization leader Berta Soler, are arrested nearly every week.\n\nThe Cuban regime actively supports and advises Venezuela. Some estimates place the number of Cuban state security agents in Venezuela running government operations at close to 100,000 people. As a result, Cuba\u2019s economy has suffered, beaten down by the related collapse of Venezuela\u2019s.

Nicaragua\u2019s government became significantly more violence in April of this year in response to a series of peaceful protests that began with demands to preserve the current social security system but resulted in widespread protests for Ortega to step down. Ortega has ordered police to violently attack and arrest peaceful dissidents.

On the same day he spoke with Trump at dinner, Erdogan announced Turkey has shared what it describes as audio recordings of Khashoggi\u2019s murder with the governments of the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2.\n\nA squabble promptly broke out between Turkey and France over the Khashoggi tapes, as chronicled by Reuters on Monday:\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian had questioned remarks by Erdogan at the weekend in which he said Turkey gave tapes relating to Khashoggi\u2019s killing to the United States, Saudi Arabia, Germany, France and Britain. Le Drian said he was not aware that France had any tapes. Asked if Erdogan was lying, he said: \u201cHe has a political game to play in these circumstances\u201d. That prompted a furious response from Ankara, which insisted it had shared evidence with Paris and said Le Drian\u2019s comments were unacceptable. \u201cOur intelligence shared information with them on Oct 24, including the voice recordings,\u201d Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said. \u201cIt is very impudent for them to accuse our president of playing political games.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if soon France chooses to deny this murder, even though Saudi Arabia already confessed,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWhat\u2019s behind the remarks of the French foreign minister? I wonder if they are trying to cover up the murder.\u201d\n\nSome of the dispute appears to revolve around whether Turkey handed over recordings that could be subjected to forensic analysis by foreign intelligence agencies, or merely allowed a few foreign officials to listen to them.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday was hailed as the first Western leader to confirm Turkey\u2019s claims of an audio recording, but even Trudeau merely implied that Canadian intelligence agents have listened to the tape and said he himself has not done so. Britain and Germany have thus far refused to elaborate on the evidence provided to them by Turkey.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed the Khashoggi case with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman by telephone on Sunday. According to the State Department, Pompeo \u201cemphasized that the United States will hold all of those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi accountable, and that Saudi Arabia must do the same.\u201d\n\nThe UK Guardian noted that Pompeo previously stated the Khashoggi murder \u201cviolates the norms of international law\u201d and said the United States could impose sanctions against those responsible. The Saudis have arrested 19 people in connection with the killing. Turkish officials have claimed Crown Prince Mohammed was either complicit in the murder or ordered Khashoggi\u2019s death himself.\n\nBritish Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt also signaled his government\u2019s determination to investigate the murder, announcing that he would meet with top Saudi officials as well as the king and crown prince.\n\n\u201cThe international community remain united in horror and outrage at the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi one month ago.

Spider-Man was goaded into superhero work by his alter ego, Peter Parker, who suffered from unrequited crushes, money problems, and dandruff. The Silver Surfer, an alien doomed to wander Earth\u2019s atmosphere, waxed about the woeful nature of man. The Hulk was marked by self-loathing. Daredevil was blind and Iron Man had a weak heart.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of Stan Lee\u2019s characters is that they were characters first and superheroes next,\u201d Jeff Kline, executive producer of the \u201cMen in Black\u201d animated television series, told The Blade of Toledo, Ohio, in 1998.\n\nSome of Lee\u2019s creations became symbols of social change \u2014 the inner turmoil of Spider-Man represented \u201960s America, for example, while The Black Panther and The Savage She-Hulk mirrored the travails of minorities and women.\n\nLee scripted most of Marvel\u2019s superhero comics himself during the \u201960s, including the Avengers and the X-Men, two of the most enduring. In 1972, he became Marvel\u2019s publisher and editorial director; four years later, 72 million copies of Spider-Man were sold.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s become our Mickey Mouse,\u201d he once said of the masked, web-crawling crusader.\n\nLee also published several books, including \u201cThe Superhero Women\u201d in 1977 and \u201cHow to Draw Comics the Marvel Way\u201d the following year, when he was named publisher of the year by the Periodical and Book Association of America.\n\nCBS turned the Hulk into a successful TV series, with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno portraying the doomed scientist from 1978-82. A Spider-Man series ran briefly in 1978. Both characters were featured in animated TV series as well.\n\nThe first big-budget movie based on Lee\u2019s characters, \u201cX-Men,\u201d was a smash in 2000, earning more than $130 million at North American theaters. \u201cSpider-Man\u201d did even better, taking in more than $400 million in 2002.\n\nStanley Martin Lieber was born Dec. 28, 1922, in New York. He grew up a fan of \u201cHardy Boys\u201d adventure books and Errol Flynn movies and got a job at Timely Comics after graduating from high school.\n\nWithin a few months, the editor and art director quit, leaving the 17-year-old Lee with creative control over the company, which grew and was renamed Atlas Comics and, finally, Marvel. Lieber changed his name, thinking Lee would be used for \u201csilly little comics\u201d and his real name would be reserved for novels.\n\nHis early work largely reflected popular movies \u2014 westerns, crime dramas, romance, whatever was the rage at the time. He worked for about 50 cents per page.\n\nAfter a stint in the Army during World War II, writing for training films, he was back at Marvel to begin a long and admittedly boring run of assembly line comic book production.\n\nComics in the 1950s was the subject of Senate hearings pushed by the Comics Code Authority, which frowned on gore and characters that questioned authority. Major comic book companies adopted the code as a form of self-regulation to avoid sanctions.\n\nLee said he was also working for a publisher who considered comics as fare only for children.\n\n\u201cOne day I said, \u2018This is insane,'\u201d Lee told the Guardian in 1979. \u201cI\u2019m just doing the same type of stories as everybody else. I wasn\u2019t taking pride in my work and I wanted to quit. But my wife said, \u2018Look, why don\u2019t you do the kind of comics you want for a change?'\u201d\n\nThe result was the first issue of \u201cThe Fantastic Four,\u201d in 1960, with the characters, plot, and text from Lee and the illustrations by famed Marvel artist Jack Kirby.\n\nThe characters were normal people changed into reluctant superheroes through no fault of their own.\n\nWriting in \u201cOrigins of Marvel Comics,\u201d Lee described the quartet this way: \u201cThe characters would be the kind of characters I could personally relate to; they\u2019d be flesh and blood, they\u2019d have their faults and foibles, they\u2019d be fallible and feisty and \u2014 most important of all \u2014 inside their colorful, costumed booties they\u2019d still have feet of clay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man\u201d followed in 1962 and before long, Marvel Comics was an industry behemoth.\n\nLee knew his work was different, proudly noting that stories were drawn out over several issues not to make money but to better develop characters, situations, and themes. He didn\u2019t neglect his villains, either. One, the Moleman, went bad when he was ostracized because of his appearance, Lee wrote, adding it was \u201calmost unheard of in a comic book\u201d to explain why a character was what he was.\n\nLee\u2019s direct influence faded in the 1970s as he gave up some of his editorial duties at Marvel. But with his trademark white mustache and tinted sunglasses, he was the industry\u2019s most recognizable figure. He lectured widely on popular culture.\n\nLee moved to Los Angeles in 1981 to head Marvel Productions, an animation studio that was later purchased, along with Marvel Comics, for $50 million by New World Entertainment.\n\nAs sales of comics declined, Marvel was forced into bankruptcy proceedings that meant it had to void a lifetime contract prohibiting Lee from working for anyone else. Lee later sued Marvel for $10 million, saying the company cheated him out of millions in profits from movies based on his characters.\n\nIn 2000, Lee agreed to write stories for DC Comics, reinventing Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and other signature characters for Marvel\u2019s one-time rival. DC Vice President and Publisher Paul Levitz had nothing but praise when the agreement was made.\n\n\u201cWith his artistic collaborators at Marvel, Stan co-created the richest imaginary universe a single comics writer has ever built,\u201d he said.\n\nThe dapper, friendly comic book genius continued to work into his 90s on numerous projects, including comics, films, and DVDs.\n\nIn the late 1990s, he looked to capitalize on the Internet craze, offering animated \u201cWebisodes\u201d of comic-like action. Stan Lee Media also sought to reach out to Web-savvy youth through deals with pop artists the Backstreet Boys and Mary J. Blige.\n\nThe company went bankrupt, and three men were indicted for allegedly defrauding the business in a check-kiting scam. Lee wasn\u2019t implicated.\n\nAfter that initial failure, Lee formed the successful Pow! Entertainment company to launch animated Internet-based projects.\n\nLee is survived by his wife of 70 years, Joan Clayton Boocock, and a daughter, Joanie.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "China\u2019s state media outlets praised official Zhang Jun and its United Nations delegation on Monday for celebrating the country\u2019s alleged human rights progress before the international forum, failing to mention Communist Party leader Xi Jinping\u2019s expansion of political re-education camps and terror campaigns against religious minorities.\n\nChina \u2013 along with several prominent serial human rights violators like Saudi Arabia, Cuba, and Venezuela \u2013 is a member of the U.N. Human Rights Council, which required Beijing to submit a report on its human rights situation for its Universal Periodic Review this year. The council approved China\u2019s report last week.\n\nZhang Jun, assistant minister of foreign affairs, addressed the Human Rights Council last week on China\u2019s behalf, asserting that the country had made \u201ctangible and enormous progress in human rights\u201d since its last review five years ago, according to the state-run China Daily.\n\n\u201cOver 120 countries spoke positively of the report and praised the concept and practice of human rights with Chinese characteristics,\u201d China Daily claimed.\n\nThe Global Times, another government propaganda outlet, reported that the council \u201cunanimously adopted the report submitted by China on Friday during the third round of the Universal Periodic Review in Geneva, Switzerland.\u201d The Times went on to criticize Western media for allegedly ignoring that progress China has made through its \u201cown standards and value system,\u201d which does not match the West\u2019s understanding of freedom and human rights.\n\nThe newspaper typically takes the most vocal line in English against criticisms of Xi\u2019s regime. Last month, the Global Times defended Xi\u2019s policy of interning over one million ethnic Uighur Muslims in political re-education camps, where witnesses say they are forced to learn Mandarin, abandon their native Uighur language, memorize Communist Party propaganda songs, and eat pork as a rebuke to Islam, among other forced submissive activities.\n\n\u201cSince the beginning of this year, some Western media and politicians have been viciously attacking actions adopted by Xinjiang to help those affected by extremism to return to their families and society through educational transformation,\u201d the Times asserted. \u201cRadical Western politicians and media have set off a wave of anti-China rhetoric and Xinjiang has become their new target.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper noted on Sunday that China, in addition to receiving praise from the Human Rights Council for its alleged achievements, launched an exhibition called \u201cDevelopment of Human Rights in the New Era in China\u201d this month in Geneva\u2019s U.N. outpost.\n\nThe U.N. Human Rights Council held a meeting on November 9, where Zhang spoke, to adopt China\u2019s report on its own human rights practices. At the meeting, a representative from Kenya \u2013 tasked with speaking on behalf of his country, Hungary, and Saudi Arabia, which reviewed the report \u2013 stated that the group was \u201cpleased that China will examine\u201d the 346 recommendations the council has for improving the human rights situation, many of which revolved around alleviating poverty. One recommendation did condemn China for cracking down on religious groups, however, particularly Tibetan Buddhists, Uighur Muslims, and Falun Gong practitioners. Burundi, one of the countries reviewing the report, urged China to continue its \u201ccrackdown on separatist organizations,\u201d language China typically uses in relation to oppressing Uighurs.\n\nThe full report from the Human Rights Council in response to China\u2019s submission will be published at the end of the month. Among the nations on the council are Afghanistan, China itself, Cuba, Iraq, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. The United States withdrew from the council in June citing its chronic support for human rights violators around the world.\n\nChina submitted its human rights Universal Periodic Review in August. The review heavily criticized the idea of universal human rights, instead arguing, \u201cthere is no universal road for the development of human rights in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs an important element in the economic and social development of each country, the cause of human rights must be promoted on the basis of the national conditions and the needs of the people of that country, and cannot be defined on the basis of a single authority,\u201d the report insisted.\n\nChina congratulated itself in the report, and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201cThought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,\u201d for \u201cever acting as an advocate, practitioner and promoter of the cause of protecting human rights and always following the road of developing human rights with Chinese characteristics.\u201d\n\nChina, Chinese officials allege, has \u201cwritten a historic chapter of human rights progress and broadened the practical programme for international human rights protections.\u201d The report specifically claims that Xinjiang, home to post of the Uighur minority, has been home to a new campaign for promoting human rights through investing in Chinese-approved businesses.\n\nWhat the report fails to mention about Xinjiang is that it is now believed to be home to at least 44 internment camps for Muslim Uighurs. The camps use violence to force individuals to memorize communist propaganda and abandon Islam, according to human rights groups. The Chinese government insists these camps are for \u201cvocational training\u201d and provide a valuable service to its prisoners.\n\nA report from Radio Free Asia (RFA) last week revealed that Beijing has begun targeting Uighur children as well as adults, placing hundreds in indoctrination centers it calls \u201cclosed schools\u201d with similar curricula to the internment camps for adults.\n\nXi Jinping has also ordered an escalation in violent regime acts against Christians, sending government demolition teams to destroy churches and remove crosses nationwide. Reports from within the country indicate that the number of destructive incidents against Christian places of worship has escalated since the Vatican began negotiating with China on a deal that may soon allow the government to ordain pro-communist clergy without Catholic Church approval.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "Prominent Labour MPs have spoken out against reports that Britain will expand the use of stop and search amidst rising knife violence, blasting the police tactic as \u201cracist\u201d.\n\nOfficials from the Home Office have reportedly been in talks with officers over the past two weeks to discuss police chiefs\u2019 proposals to drop the requirement that \u201creasonable grounds\u201d are needed before a suspect can be subjected to a search.\n\nRecent reports revealed knife crime in England and Wales has soared since 2015 when then-Home Secretary Theresa May \u2014 now Prime Minister \u2014 introduced reforms to drastically cut police use of the power, which she alleged was \u201cunfair, especially to young black men\u201d.\n\nHowever, the current Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, said Monday that officers \u201cshould feel absolutely confident\u201d to stop and search suspects irrespective of ethnic background, describing increasing knife violence as a \u201cdisease\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf we want to stop offending in the first place we should put ethnicity aside \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter if someone is black or brown or white or whatever they are,\u201d he told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain.\n\nSoros Group Brags About Pushing Racist Police Agenda In Europe, Undermining Stop And Search https://t.co/YOgdN50EYb pic.twitter.com/Myox4V14bG \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 16, 2016\n\n\u201cIf police think that there\u2019s good reason that they may be carrying an offensive weapon, the police should be absolutely empowered to stop them.

Today, in fulfilling that responsibility, I have decided to revoke the security clearance of John Brennan, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency,\u201d President Trump said of pulling Brennan\u2019s security clearance. \u201cMr. Brennan\u2019s lying and recent conduct characterized by increasingly frenzied commentary is wholly inconsistent with access to the nation\u2019s most closely held secrets.\u201d\n\nLast month, Brennan was among several prominent figures, including former President Barack Obama and progressive billionaire George Soros, to have an apparent crude pipe bomb mailed to them.

It is un-American.\u201d", "A study that the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) published on Monday found that North Korea is maintaining at least 13 ballistic missile bases, seemingly contradicting the spirit of denuclearization even as Pyongyang demands sanctions relief as a reward for the steps it has taken so far.\n\nThe report from the think tank based in Washington, DC, claimed there are about 20 \u201cundeclared North Korean missile operating bases,\u201d of which 13 have been discovered through satellite photography. The North Koreans made a great show of dismantling the missile launch facility at Sohae, which they described as a \u201csatellite launching station.\u201d However, CSIS asserted the actions taken at Sohae were a distraction, a theatrical gesture toward fulfilling commitments made by dictator Kim Jong-un at his June summit with President Trump, while many other bases in remote locations are quietly kept operational.\n\nThe New York Times pronounced the CSIS report an unmitigated disaster for President Donald Trump\u2019s North Korea policy, describing the missile bases as part of a \u201cgreat deception\u201d and slamming Trump\u2019s recent statements about denuclearization as misleading, or at best excessively optimistic:\n\nThe satellite images suggest that the North has been engaged in a great deception: It has offered to dismantle a major launching site \u2014 a step it began, then halted \u2014 while continuing to make improvements at more than a dozen others that would bolster launches of conventional and nuclear warheads. The existence of the ballistic missile bases, which North Korea has never acknowledged, contradicts Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that his landmark diplomacy is leading to the elimination of a nuclear and missile program that the North had warned could devastate the United States. \u201cWe are in no rush,\u201d Mr. Trump said of talks with the North at a news conference on Wednesday, after Republicans lost control of the House. \u201cThe sanctions are on. The missiles have stopped. The rockets have stopped. The hostages are home.\u201d\n\nThe Times noted that CSIS tapped Victor Cha, \u201ca prominent North Korea expert whom the Trump administration considered appointing as the ambassador to South Korea last year,\u201d and strongly implied Trump made a mistake by not heeding Cha\u2019s warnings about North Korea:\n\nA State Department spokesman responded to the findings with a written statement suggesting that the government believed the sites must be dismantled: \u201cPresident Trump has made clear that should Chairman Kim follow through on his commitments, including complete denuclearization and the elimination of ballistic missile programs, a much brighter future lies ahead for North Korea and its people.\u201d A spokesman for the C.I.A. declined to comment. The revelation of the bases comes as Mr. Trump\u2019s signature piece of diplomacy, based on his meeting exactly five months ago with Mr. Kim, appears in peril. Publicly, Mr. Trump remains relentlessly optimistic, to the point that he said at a campaign rally that he and Mr. Kim, one of the world\u2019s most brutal dictators, \u201cfell in love.\u201d But last week, talks with the North hit another snag, as it declared that it would not send its chief negotiator to meet with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in New York to plan the next summit meeting.\n\n\u201cWhat everybody is worried about is that Trump is going to accept a bad deal \u2014 they give us a single test site and dismantle a few other things, and in return they get a peace agreement,\u201d Cha said, predicting Trump might \u201cdeclare victory, say he got more than any other American president ever got, and the threat would still be there.\u201d\n\nReuters looked at the report on Monday and pointed out that maintaining the missile bases in question is not a blatant violation of the promises Kim made in June. CSIS researcher Joseph Bermudez noted activity at the 13 sites consists of \u201cmaintenance and minor infrastructure improvements\u201d at remote facilities the North really ought to be dismantling, or at least clearly identifying to international arms inspectors:\n\nThe sites identified in the CSIS report are scattered in remote, mountainous areas across North Korea, and could be used to house ballistic missiles of various ranges, with the largest believed to be capable of striking anywhere in the United States. \u201cMissile operating bases are not launch facilities,\u201d Bermudez wrote. \u201cWhile missiles could be launched from within them in an emergency, Korean People\u2019s Army (KPA) operational procedures call for missile launchers to disperse from the bases to pre-surveyed or semi-prepared launch sites for operations.\u201d None of the missile bases have been acknowledged by North Korea, and analysts say an accurate disclosure of nuclear weapons and missile capabilities would be an important part of any denuclearization deal.\n\nBases like the Sakkanmol facility profiled at length by CSIS are basically depots for mobile launchers that can threaten South Korea, Japan, and American bases in the region with short- and medium-range weapons. North Korea has yet to discuss abandoning such launch capabilities and would be inclined to argue that it never agreed to completely dismantle its missile launch system.\n\nThe major concern about North Korea is its push to obtain sanctions relief as a reward for the actions it has taken so far. This would surprise no one who has spent even a few minutes studying the long and frustrating history of North Korean disarmament initiatives.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald observed during the weekend that South Korea is pushing for reconciliation with the North at breakneck speed, and investors in other nations, including Australia, are eager to cash in. That could be a problem, as the international sanctions regime disintegrates long before complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization is achieved, or it could be helpful as Pyongyang becomes reluctant to scare away all that foreign money with provocative nuclear and missile tests.\n\nPyongyang has always believed the West and its allies in Seoul lack the will to maintain maximum sanctions pressure long enough to make the North comply with non-negotiable demands. It seems a bit premature to declare failure over demands that have not even been made yet.", "TEL AVIV \u2013 Israel is \u201cshielding\u201d Europe from Middle Eastern terrorism, and European nations should show more gratitude and less \u201chostility\u201d to the Jewish state, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday in Paris.\n\n\u201cIsrael is Europe\u2019s shield in the Middle East [from terrorism], and without us it would spread and many more people would push into Europe,\u201d said Netanyahu to reporters at the sidelines of an event marking 100 years since World War I. \u201cWhen we protect ourselves, we are also protecting Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly have criticism of the one-sided and hostile approach of the European Union to Israel,\u201d said the prime minister, pointing to the European body\u2019s funding for human rights groups that document alleged abuses by Israeli soldiers.\n\nIsraeli intelligence sharing and terror training with European nations have helped thwart scores of terror attacks in recent years, including an attack planned for a Paris suburb, aviation attacks on European cities and the hijacking of planes, and last month\u2019s plot by Tehran to assassinate three Iranian opposition figures on Danish soil.\n\nNetanyahu also said that diplomacy was futile with Hamas terror leaders in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\u201cThere is no diplomatic solution for Gaza, just as there is no diplomatic solution for ISIS,\u201d said Netanyahu.\n\n\u201cI am doing everything I can to avoid an unnecessary war,\u201d said the prime minister, pointing to the deaths of millions during World War I as an example of senseless bloody warfare. \u201cI am not afraid of war if it\u2019s necessary, but I want to avoid it if it\u2019s not necessary.\u201d\n\nHowever, mere hours after his comments, intense clashes broke out between Israeli forces and fighters in the Gaza Strip, forcing him to cut his trip short and return to Israel.

Linda Sarsour, a member of the board and former president of Women\u2019s March USA, is notorious for her propagation of anti-Semitism toward Israel. This transpired not only through her statement from March 2017 claiming that feminists could not be Zionists simultaneously and that Zionists were Nazis, but also through her demonization and delegitimization of Israel, as well as the application of a double standard.

Hint: It Had Something to Do With Trump,\u201d the Wall Street Journal investigates why Facebook chose to fire Palmer Luckey, one of the companies top executives and founder of Oculus VR. It was during the 2016 presidential election that Luckey\u2019s political views became known after donating $10,000 to an anti-Hillary Clinton group called Nimble America, six months after this donation Luckey was out at Facebook.\n\nMark Zuckerberg was asked about Luckey\u2019s firing from the company when questioned by Congress, he denied it had anything to do with politics. However, Luckey claims that following his donation to the anti-Hillary group Zuckerberg pressured him to express his support for the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson rather than President Trump:\n\nMr. Luckey, it turns out, was put on leave, then fired, according to people familiar with the matter. More recently, he has told people the reason was his support for Donald Trump and the furor that his political beliefs sparked within Facebook and Silicon Valley, some of those people say. Internal Facebook emails suggest the matter was discussed at the highest levels of the company. In the fall of 2016, as unhappiness over the donation simmered, Facebook executives including Mr. Zuckerberg pressured Mr. Luckey to publicly voice support for libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, despite Mr. Luckey\u2019s yearslong support of Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the conversations and internal emails viewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal notes that Lucker\u2019s firing appeared to be the start of Silicon Valley\u2019s extreme liberal bias being questioned by the masses. The issue of Silicon Valley\u2019s liberal bias became so well known that Zuckerberg was even grilled by Ted Cruz during a hearing before Congress about Luckey\u2019s firing:\n\nMr. Luckey\u2019s ouster from Facebook was a harbinger of battles that have broken out over the past year over the overwhelmingly liberal culture of Silicon Valley, which has given the tech industry public-relations headaches and brought unwanted attention from Washington. Executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google, a unit of Alphabet , have had to answer questions from lawmakers about potential bias in their treatment of conservative viewpoints. Tech executives concede that Silicon Valley is predominantly liberal\u2014Mr. Zuckerberg said in Senate testimony that it is \u201can extremely left-leaning place\u201d\u2014yet they have steadfastly maintained that politics doesn\u2019t play a role in how they police content on their sites.\n\nLuckey apologized via Facebook for possibly upsetting those he worked with through his donation to Nimble America and stated that he voted for Gary Johnson, Facebook themselves allegedly advised Luckey on what to say and suggested many changes:\n\nIn an apology posted on Facebook that month, Mr. Luckey denied writing the NimbleRichMan posts and said he \u201ccontributed $10,000 to NimbleAmerica because I thought the organization had fresh ideas on how to communicate with young voters through the use of several billboards.\u201d The post said Mr. Luckey is a libertarian and planned to vote for Mr. Johnson in the election. \u201cI need to tell you that Mark [Zuckerberg] himself drafted this and details are critical,\u201d Facebook Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal wrote to a lawyer for Mr. Luckey in a September 2016 email, attaching an early draft of the statement, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.

Paglia covered topics ranging from postmodernism to the #MeToo movement.\n\nLehmann asked Paglia about her views on the \u201csocial justice\u201d movement, which many have argued has morphed into a sort of religion.\n\nAs an atheist, I have argued that if religion is erased, something must be put in its place. Belief systems are intrinsic to human intelligence and survival. They \u201cframe\u201d the flux of primary experience, which would otherwise flood the mind. But politics cannot fill the gap. Society, with which Marxism is obsessed, is only a fragment of the totality of life. As I have written, Marxism has no metaphysics: it cannot even detect, much less comprehend, the enormity of the universe and the operations of nature. Those who invest all of their spiritual energies in politics will reap the whirlwind.

Hatred for America has been a powerful mobilizing force in France since shortly after the American army liberated the French from Nazi German occupation in 1944.\n\nIn his speech at the official ceremony marking a hundred years since the U.S. saved France from Germany and ended World War I, Macron took a direct swipe at President Donald Trump and his voters. Macron said that the \u201cancient demons\u201d that caused World War I and millions of deaths are growing stronger.\n\n\u201cPatriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism. Nationalism is the betrayal of patriotism,\u201d Macron pronounced, as Trump and other world leaders looked on.\n\nHe added, \u201cIn saying \u2018Our interests first, whatever happens to the others,\u2019 you erase the most precious thing a nation can have, that which makes it live, that which causes it to be great and that which is most important: Its moral values.\u201d\n\nMacron\u2019s speech on Sunday was his second rhetorical assault against America in under a week. In a radio interview last Tuesday, Macron called for Europe to raise \u201ca true European army,\u201d to defend against the U.S., Russia and China.\n\nIn Macron\u2019s words, \u201cWe have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America.\u201d\n\nUpon landing in France over the weekend, Trump called Macron\u2019s remarks about defending against America \u201cinsulting.\u201d The President tweeted that instead of figuring out a way to fight the U.S., the Europeans should pay their share of NATO\u2019s budget, which the U.S. has been underwriting.\n\nMacron\u2019s anti-Americanism isn\u2019t only fueled by domestic political concerns. He has two other \u2013 perhaps even more significant \u2013 causes for his hostility.\n\nFirst, and most fundamentally, Macron rightly views Trump\u2019s presidency and his nationalist vision of America as an existential threat to the European Union. As political philosopher Yoram Hazony explains in his vital book, The Virtue of Nationalism, (Basic Books 2018), globalism, the foundational rationale of the European Union, is in essence an imperialist project.\n\nLike its ideological twin and sometimes competitor in the U.S. \u2014 namely, American internationalism or liberal internationalism \u2014 the EU is predicated on the idea that nations should be shorn of their power to determine and advance their national interests in accordance with the values and needs of their people.\n\nIn the neo-imperialist models advanced by the EU and by American internationalists, national powers should be transferred to international, transnational, or supranational bodies.\n\nHazony explains that with little to no discussion inside their own societies, and no consent from their respective publics, at the end of the Cold War, \u201cWestern leaders became preoccupied with two great imperialist projects: the European Union, which has progressively relieved member nations of many of the powers usually associated with political independence; and the project of establishing an American \u2018world order,\u2019 in which nations that do not abide by international law will be coerced into doing so, principally by means of American military might.\u201d\n\nAs Hazony explained, the absence of discussion about the imperialist nature of these two projects owed in part to the absence of public support for them. In Europe, the EU\u2019s demand for member nations to surrender their national independence to Brussels has never been popular. A decade ago, the French, the Dutch, and the Irish all voted down increased integration in the European Union. The French, Dutch and Irish all viewed increased integration as a blow to democratic norms.\n\nRather than respect their objections and forge a less coercive form of union, the leaders of the EU in Brussels drafted a new agreement among themselves that simply rewrote the rejected treaties while blocking member states from putting their actions before their people for approval.\n\nIn 2016, of course, the British people voted to abandon the EU altogether in favor of national sovereignty. In the intervening two years, we have seen repeated attempts by the EU on the one hand and by British opponents of Brexit on the other to water down the Brexit vote to meaninglessness.\n\nIn the U.S., Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d message resonated in the national psyche after two decades of post-Cold War presidents preaching various forms of liberal internationalism. George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama all in their turn embraced the mantle of American global leadership predicated on various notions of post-nationalist international law, democracy, and liberal internationalism. Each, in turn, involved the U.S. in ideological wars and campaigns that brought few gains to the American people.\n\nAs in Europe, American rejection of \u201cPax Americana: is more visceral than intellectual. Intellectual analysis of the merits of a U.S.-led global world order has been blocked by the unsubstantiated assertion by globalists that nationalism is inherently malevolent. Hazony\u2019s book provides the missing philosophical argument for Trump\u2019s nationalism, and places it in the long tradition of American nationalism that stretched from the Pilgrims to the Second World War.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s nationalist message has won the U.S. the appreciation, support and respect of many European nations as well as many nations worldwide. Following the lead of the American voters, the Hungarians and Austrians elected nationalist leaders. Hungarian President Viktor Orban and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, along with Polish President Andez Duda and others, have embraced Trump\u2019s nationalist model. They rightly view it as an alternative to the EU.\n\nThe EU leadership in Brussels, Paris, and Berlin in turn perceives the rise of nationalist governments and parties in Europe as a strategic threat to the European Union. As the leader of this resurgent nationalist wave, coming after four successive U.S. administrations led by presidents who saw the world very much as the European globalists see it, Trump threatens the EU more fundamentally than any single leader ever has.\n\nThe final reason that Macron believes his interests are served by picking a fight with Trump is because he is trying to position himself as the heir to outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s leadership of the EU.\n\nSince taking office, Macron has repeatedly shown that his view of leadership has little to do with actual accomplishments. As France\u2019s economy dribbles along with recession-like growth rates, and the French people express deep seated pessimism about their future, Macron entertains them with stunts and photo-ops. During his meeting with Trump at the NATO summit in Brussels in May 2017, for instance, Macron famously tried to assert his dominance over Trump by squeezing his hand during their handshake.\n\nIn his radio interview last week, Macron said the Trump administration\u2019s decision last month to withdraw from the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) is what propelled him to declare that Europe needs to defend itself against the United States, just as it needs to defend itself from Russia and China.\n\nIn his words, \u201cWhen I see President Trump announcing that he\u2019s quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the 1980s Euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim? Europe and its security.\u201d\n\nThe ironic aspect of Macron\u2019s statement is that the reason the U.S. pulled out of the INF treaty, which bars the U.S. and Russia from fielding and developing nuclear and conventional missiles and launchers with ranges of 500-1,000 kilometers, is that Russia was systematically breaching it. And Russia\u2019s missile development activities directly threaten Europe.\n\nBy withdrawing from the INF, the Trump administration merely granted itself the ability to contend with the reality that the treaty is already dead.\n\nIt is impossible to see how Europe would be safer if the Trump administration had simply maintained the Obama administration\u2019s abject refusal to acknowledge that the Russians have been actively developing and deploying intermediate range missiles for years.\n\nThis then brings us to the crux of Macron\u2019s conceit \u2013 and indeed the conceit of the European Union more generally. The EU presents itself as a world power not by virtue of its actions, but by virtue of its virtue-signaling against America. Trump endangers Europe by rejecting the EU\u2019s assertion of moral superiority in favor of the brick-and-mortar national interests of the American people.\n\nCaroline Glick is a world-renowned journalist and commentator on the Middle East and U.S. foreign policy, and the author of The Israeli Solution: A One-State Plan for Peace in the Middle East.

Vice is currently on track to bring in $600 to $650 million in revenue, which is not only $100 million below projection; it is what the company earned last year \u2014 and last year, Vice lost $100 million.\n\nAll this during a booming economy, no less.\n\nVice Media\u2019s CEO, Nancy Dubuc, has instituted a hiring freeze and hopes to cull those 1,350 employees over the next year only through attrition (unlikely).

The Walt Disney Company, which proved it was not so family friendly by pouring $400 million into this \u201cNSFW\u201d brand, had its otherwise glowing quarterly report marred with a $157 million write-down on its Vice investment.\n\nAlso working against Vice is a sexual harassment scandal that resulted in Dubuc replacing founder Shane Smith as CEO five months ago. Smith moved over to become executive chairman.\n\nAnother looming Vice failure is Viceland, a cable channel launched in 2015. This move never made any sense to anyone. Vice\u2019s core audience is millennials, and millennials are running away from those $150 cable TV bills in record numbers. Investing in cable during the streaming boom is like investing in vinyl just as CDs were coming on.\n\nIn 2016, just days after the channel\u2019s launch, Smith bragged that he could reverse the cord-cutting trend, that millennials would be so smitten with reruns of It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and original programming, like Weedetiquette and Gaycation, cable TV would be saved.

At least that\u2019s what liberal California would have us believe.\n\nThe latest alarmist to make political capital out of the fires is California Governor Jerry Brown, who on Sunday \u2013 in the wake of celebrities including rocker Neil Young and talk show host Jimmy Kimmel \u2013 sought to pin them on climate change.\n\nAccording to Politico:\n\nBrown called California\u2019s recent battles with massive wildfires \u201cthe new abnormal.\u201d He added: \u201cScientists and the engineers and the firefighters all tell us forest management is one element\u2019\u2019 to control them, but warned governments must address \u201ca whole range of actions\u201d to address a problem he said may cost \u201cbillions\u201d of dollars to tackle. \u201cManaging all the forests everywhere we can does not stop climate change \u2014 and those that deny that are definitely contributing to the tragedy,\u2019\u2019 Brown said. \u201cThe chickens are coming home to roost. This is real here.\u201d He advised that governments and officials need to be \u201cpulling together in these tragic circumstances and thinking wisely,\u2019\u2019 while being \u201ccollaborative.\u2019\u2019\n\nGovernor Moonbeam, like many California liberals, has been mightily irked by the president\u2019s claim that the fires were mainly down to the negligence and incompetence of the state\u2019s authorities:\n\nThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2018\n\nBut Moonbeam\u2019s fury is the rage of Caliban seeing himself reflected in the glass: it is highly unlikely that the fires had anything whatsoever to do with \u2018climate change\u2019; it is much more likely that they are at least partly the result of the green religion championed by Moonbeam and most of Hollywood.\n\nAs an experienced forester, Bob Zybach, told the Daily Caller earlier this year, many of the wildfires which have ravaged the western U.S. are a consequence of misguided, \u201ceco-friendly\u201d policies introduced in the Clinton era.\n\nWhile some want to blame global warming for the uptick in catastrophic wildfires, Zybach said a change in forest management policies is the main reason Americans are seeing a return to more intense fires, particularly in the Pacific Northwest and California where millions of acres of protected forests stand. \u201cWe knew exactly what would happen if we just walked away,\u201d Zybach, an experienced forester with a PhD in environmental science, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. Zybach spent two decades as a reforestation contractor before heading to graduate school in the 1990s. Then the Clinton administration in 1994 introduced its plan to protect old growth trees and spotted owls by strictly limiting logging. Less logging also meant government foresters weren\u2019t doing as much active management of forests \u2014 thinnings, prescribed burns and other activities to reduce wildfire risk.\n\nThere is no evidence that the climate in California has changed in such a way as to make forest fires more likely.\n\nAccording the Fifth (and most recent) Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), rainfall is expected to change little as a result of \u2018climate change.\u2019\n\nMore likely, the answer is that these fires are simply a case of the Californian environment doing what it has always done. It\u2019s just unfortunate that there are now more people living in the area to suffer when things go wrong.\n\nAs the Daily Caller article noted:\n\nWildfire experts have also increasingly been pointing to the fact that more people and infrastructure are located in wildfire-prone areas than in the past, increasing the risk of wildfires impacting livelihoods. A recent study found the number of homes at risk of wildfires in the western U.S. increased 1,000 percent since 1940, from about 607,000 in 1940 to 6.7 million. Since most fires are ignited by humans, the more people in fire-prone areas the higher the risk. \u201cThis is a people problem,\u201d said U.S. Geological Survey fire expert Jon Keeley. \u201cWhat\u2019s changing is not the fires themselves but the fact that we have more and more people at risk.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too early to say what and who, if anyone, can be held to blame for the California fires. But whatever the usual Hollywood suspects may tell you, it\u2019s definitely not Donald Trump.", "MSNBC contributor Donny Deutsch on Monday\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d suggested President Donald Trump would attempt a military coup if he ran for re-election in 2020 and lost.\n\n\u201cDo you really think as things continue to get worse and worse for him that he is going to put himself on the ballot in 2020 knowing he\u2019s going to lose?

Jerry Brown blamed climate change Sunday for the California wildfires, despite a complete lack of evidence \u2014 a day after President Donald Trump was widely criticized for blaming poor forest management.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Brown, described as an \u201cevangelist\u201d for climate change, also blamed climate change deniers for the deadly fires, saying they were responsible for the deaths of California residents.\n\n\u201cManaging all the forests in everywhere we can does not stop climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd those who deny that are definitely contributing to the tragedies that we\u2019re now witnessing, and will continue to witness in the coming years.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s theory is that over-regulation has led to under-harvesting of forests, leaving more fuel for fires to burn. Brown\u2019s theory is that the global use of fossil fuels is making California warmer and drier, and more prone to fires.\n\nThe exact causes of the Camp Fire in Northern California, and the Woolsely fire in Southern California, which are currently burning across a collective 200,000 acres and have killed over 30 people, have yet to be determined.\n\nHowever, the primary reason California is naturally prone to fires is that it has a broadly Mediterranean climate, with short, rainy winters; hot, dry summers; and occasional periods of prolonged drought.\n\nMoreover, as California\u2019s population nears 40 million people, and as the high cost of housing encourages people to move into rural or peri-urban areas, the risk grows that ordinary human activity will start fires.\n\nSeveral recent fires have been started by power lines downed in high winds, and even by tire bursts on rural roadways that sent sparks into flammable brush.\n\nIn the case of the Camp and Woolsey fires, the deadly blazes have been spread by Santa Ana winds \u2014 also a naturally-occurring, seasonal phenomenon as air from the interior mountain ranges moves toward the coast.\n\nBrown has repeatedly blamed climate change for fires and other natural disasters in California \u2014 despite pushback from otherwise sympathetic scientists, who have accused the governor in the past of \u201cnoble-cause corruption.\u201d\n\nData released earlier this year showed that the U.S. led all nations in reducing carbon dioxide emissions in 2017, the year that President Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate Accords, amidst dire predictions from his opponents.\n\nJoel B.

Noted author Daniel J. Flynn wrote a similar book in 2013, titled: The War on Football.\n\n\u201cWe are in the state of California, and you have some legislation to ban football to age 14,\u201d Hoge said on Fox Sports 1\u2019s \u2018Speak for Yourself.\u2019 \u201cYou can start MMA fighting and boxing at age 8 in this state. Why would you tell me there\u2019s not a war on football, or a target if you are going to say it\u2019s okay to box? Keep this in mind. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, isn\u2019t the objective to target your head in MMA and boxing? At 8, we can box in California, but we want to ban tackle football and what is the scientific evidence that they\u2019re bringing to the table. There is no scientific evidence that there is anything wrong with kids playing contact sports. That is why I think the book is so important.\n\n\u201cWe bring out those things about what the science is saying and all the amazing things going on in football, especially youth football from protocols, treatments, therapies, practice structure, the wide gamut, how better and safer it is. In the nearly 100 years we have been playing this game, the safest environment we\u2019ve ever had is right now.\u201d\n\nSo why does Hoge think there are people trying to destroy football?\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t answer what somebody else\u2019s agenda is,\u201d Hoge said. \u201cI just see what is being done and without the proper supporting information. You have people talking about youth football, never coached youth football, not certified to coach youth football. I speak from that perspective. What there agenda is, you will have to ask them to answer that one.\u201d\n\nCummings, who is a forensic pathologist, who not only wrote this book with Hoge, but also wrote an article for Yahoo last year, titled: I\u2019m a Brain Scientist and I Let my Son Play Football.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t there there is a scientific evidence that says that football or head trauma even causes CTE,\u201d Cummings said while appearing with Hoge on Fox Sports 1. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what causes it.\u201d\n\nCTE is Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, a brain condition associated with repeated blows to the head that can cause things like dementia.\n\nCummings thinks it\u2019s reckless to always blame football for ex-football players committing suicide.\n\n\u201cAs a forensic pathologist, I have unfortunately invested hundreds and hundreds of suicide deaths and they are tragic, and they are terrible, and you never, ever point to one factor, it\u2019s multi-factorial thing and to think you can open up the brain, lay it out, and look at a spot under the microscope, and say that is what caused this person to commit suicide, there is just no way to do that. If you have somebody in the general public who commits suicide, well it\u2019s mental illness and it\u2019s like, \u2018we have to do better treating mental illness in this country.\u2019 But if a football player at any level commits suicide, \u2018it\u2019s football,\u2019 regardless of any other factor that may be going on in their lives \u2013 divorce, drug abuse, bankruptcy.\u201d", "Rocker Neil Young blasted President Donald Trump on Sunday, referring to him as a climate change \u201cdenier,\u201d after losing his Malibu home in the Southern California\u2019s Woosley fire.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is vulnerable \u2014 not because of poor forest management as DT (our so-called president) would have us think,\u201d Young wrote in a blurb on his website. \u201cAs a matter of fact this is not a forest fire that rages on as I write this. We are vulnerable because of Climate Change; the extreme weather events and our extended drought is part of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur temperatures are higher than ever here in our hottest summer on record. That has not helped,\u201d added the singer-songwriter. \u201cDT seems to be the Denier. (I\u2019m holding back and not using the word liar because it rhymes with denier). It really is time for a reckoning with this unfit leader. Maybe our new congress can help. I sure hope so.\u201d\n\nYoung ended the post, writing: \u201cImagine a leader who defies science, saying these solutions shouldn\u2019t be part of his decision-making on our behalf. Imagine a leader who cares more for his own, convenient opinion than he does for the people he leads. Imagine an unfit leader. Now imagine a fit one.\u201d\n\nWhile Young appears confidant asserting climate change caused the wildfires, California authorities have yet to release any information on what caused the trio of blazes. The California fire is the deadliest blaze in the state\u2019s modern history, killing at least 31 people. As of Sunday, the Woosley Fire has scorched 85,500 acres and destroyed nearly 180 structures. Caitlyn Jenner and Dr. Strange director Scott Derrickson were also among the celebrities who lost their homes in the blaze.\n\nThe isn\u2019t the first time the Canadian Rock and Roll Hall of Famer has taken aim at President Trump. Last week, the 72-year-old called on the president to cease playing his music during political rallies, stating the song \u201cRockin\u2019 In The Free World\u201d was being featured at the events against his \u201cwishes.\u201d\n\nPreviously, Young has sent a cease-and-desist letter to President Trump to stop playing his music but in a recent blog post admitted the president has the legal right to do so.", "Chancellor Angela Merkel should not have attended the Armistice Centenary because Germany lost the First World War, Alexander Gauland, the leader of the populist anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany (AfD), said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t put ourselves in a historical situation that clearly favours the winner and walk alongside Mr. Macron through the Arc de Triomphe,\u201d Mr Gauland said, according to Reuters.\n\nThe comments come after the German Chancellor, whose Christian Democratic Union party has been losing ground to the AfD, took part in the centenary event on Sunday in Paris with French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron.\n\nIt was during the commemorations, attended by U.S. President Donald Trump, that President Macron denounced \u201cnationalism\u201d as

Germany\u2019s President Frank-Walker Steinmeier, who became the first German leader to lay a wreath at the Cenotaph war memorial in Whitehall in what has been termed an \u201chistoric act of reconciliation\u201d between former Allied power the United Kingdom and Great War aggressor Germany.\n\nMeanwhile, former British military leaders and politicians urged the Conservative Party-led government to reverse its position on Rhodesian war veterans who fought for Britain.\n\nMore than 34,00 men from southern Rhodesia served in both world wars, with some 1,800 losing their lives.\n\nThere was first a ban on Rhodesian veterans laying a wreath at the Cenotaph following Ian Smith\u2019s declaration of independence from the UK in 1965 with another put in place in 2003 after the country, renamed Zimbabwe, withdrew from the Commonwealth under dictator Robert Mugabe.\n\nFormer head of the army General Sir Lord Dannatt said that \u201cregardless of the politics, soldiers from southern Rhodesia who fought in the First and Second World Wars should be recognised along with everybody else from the Empire and former colonies.\u201d", "Theresa May\u2019s premiership is skirting disaster, with Brexiteers accusing her of embarking on a strategy of \u201ctotal surrender\u201d in the face of a 48-hour deadline to either secure a deal with Brussels or activate \u2018No Deal\u2019 preparations.\n\nThe Prime Minister has offered a raft of heavy concessions to the European Union in order to secure free trade in goods and agri-products with the bloc and maintain an open border between the Republic of Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland.\n\nThese include payment of an enormous multi-billion pound \u2018divorce bill\u2019 to Brussels, continuing wholesale adoption of the EU\u2019s rules and regulations through a \u2018common rulebook\u2019 effectively adjudicated by EU judges, and membership of the EU Customs Union.\n\nThe proposals, which would effectively prevent the United Kingdom from regaining sovereign control of its international trade policy and regulatory regime, have already been denounced as \u2018Brexit In Name Only\u2019, or BRINO, by Leave campaigners \u2014 but, for the European Union, they do not go far enough.\n\nSpecifically, the bloc\u2019s negotiators seem unwilling to let Mrs May keep the United Kingdom in their Customs Union as a so-called \u2018backstop\u2019 solution to the supposedly all-important question of the Irish border unless there is an additional \u2018backstop to the backstop\u2019, which would keep Northern Ireland inside the Customs Union by itself while the rest of the UK is ejected in the event of any issues.\n\nThey are also insisting that the British government must not be allowed to end the backstop arrangements on their own initiative, but must instead appeal to some sort of adjudicating body \u2014 overseen by the European Court of Justice.\n\nMoreover, the EU has reportedly said it will not consider modifying these demands without further sacrifices by the United Kingdom \u2014 namely the continuing surrender of the country\u2019s plundered fisheries.\n\nBREAKING: Jo Johnson Resigns from Govt Over Brexit Plan Which would See Britain \u2018Out of Europe, Yet Run by Europe\u2019 https://t.co/wiInSxT7Qh \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 9, 2018\n\nWhile the Prime Minister embarked on her negotiations with Brussels insisting that \u2018No Deal\u2019 would be \u201cbetter than a bad deal\u201d, she seems reluctant to seriously consider exiting the bloc without a formal agreement and dealing with it on standard World Trade Organization terms, as countries like Australia and the United States do.\n\nWith just 48 hours remaining to secure an agreement before she will be forced to activate much-delayed \u2018No Deal\u2019 preparations costing hundreds of millions of pounds, both Remainers and Leavers are unhappy, with reports that that EU loyalists within her government are considering following Jo Johnson\u2019s lead in resigning to campaign for a second referendum, and senior Brexiteers like older brother Boris Johnson calling for outright mutiny.\n\n\u201cI really can\u2019t believe it but this Government seems to be on the verge of total surrender. With every day that passes we seem to be getting more craven,\u201d wrote the former Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary in his regular Telegraph column.\n\n\u201cWe have agreed to become the punk of Brussels, signing up not just to their existing rulebook but to huge chunks of future regulation \u2013 even though we will have no say in drafting that legislation\u2026. We have been so feeble in our preparations to leave the EU on WTO terms, and so unnaturally terrified of the consequences (greatly exaggerated by the scaremongers) that we have now said we will remain in the so-called customs union,\u201d he lamented.\n\n\u201cUnder the shameful proposals now before Cabinet it will be up to some joint UK/EU committee, or some \u201cindependent arbitration mechanism\u201d to decide whether the UK \u2013 an ancient and sovereign nation \u2013 is finally allowed to come out, to run its own trade policy and set its own tariffs. And most incredibly of all, the whole process will be justiciable by the European Court of Justice \u2013 yes, that court that we were all told would cease to have any say in this country,\u201d he added.\n\nThe former two-time Mayor of London urged readers to \u201cto savour the full horror of this capitulation,\u201d which he characterised as a downgrade on Britain\u2019s current situation, equivalent to \u201cterms that might be enforced on a colony\u201d.\n\nJohnson then went even further, accusing the Prime Minister \u2014 who like most of her Cabinet campaigned for a Remain vote in 2016 \u2014 of having \u201cdeliberately and flagrantly failed to prepare the UK to walk away from the talks, the better to be able to bludgeon MPs into voting for surrender.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis deal, when it comes, must be thrown out wholesale. It is not too late to do better \u2013 and the country deserves it,\u201d he pleaded.\n\nIndeed, if Tory Brexiteers and pro-second referendum Remainers like Jo Johnson combine with Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party and the Labour opposition to vote down a deal, the only Brexit on the table would be a \u2018No Deal\u2019 which commands little support in the largely europhile House of Commons.\n\nHow the Prime Minister could square this circle is unclear \u2014 and there are rumours that her only plan is to gamble on securing a public mandate in another snap election.\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "Border Patrol agents assigned to an immigration checkpoint in South Texas apprehended 81 migrants being smuggled in a refrigerated tractor-trailer.

The clashes killed an Israeli lieutenant colonel and prompted Israeli airstrikes and a salvo of rocket fire from Gaza toward Israel.\n\nThe cross-border fighting came just days after Israel and Hamas reached indirect understandings, backed by Qatar and Egypt, to allow cash and fuel into Gaza. The understandings are meant to be part of a broader effort to alleviate deteriorating conditions in the impoverished territory after 11 years of an Israeli-Egyptian blockade.\n\nIt was not clear if the burst of violence, which appeared to have subsided early Monday, would derail those arrangements.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a visit to Paris because of the flare-up, and he returned to Israel on Monday for consultations with top security officials.\n\nIn Gaza, Hamas authorities beefed up security measures after the incident, deploying checkpoints all over the territory. The group also canceled a weekly beach protest in northwestern Gaza along the border with Israel. The organizers said Monday\u2019s protest was postponed \u201cdue to the ongoing security situation.\u201d\n\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh led a funeral for four militants as masked gunmen in uniforms carried the coffins, wrapped in the flag of Hamas\u2019 armed wing, and mourners chanted \u201crevenge.\u201d\n\nThe Hamas military wing, Izzedine al-Qassam, said that in Sunday\u2019s incursion, Israeli undercover forces drove about 3 kilometers (2 miles) into southeastern Gaza and shot and killed Nour el-Deen Baraka, a mid-level commander in charge of a sensitive area in the southern Gaza Strip town of Khan Younis. Qassam members discovered the car and chased it, prompting Israeli airstrikes that killed several people, the group said.\n\nThe empty vehicle apparently used by the Israeli force was reduced to a charred chassis after aircraft fired several missiles at it, leaving a gaping crater in the ground.\n\nThe Israeli military said there had been an exchange of fire during an operation in Gaza, with troops withdrawing from the territory with the help of aircraft. It said that militants then launched 17 rockets from Gaza toward Israeli communities, where school and train service was cancelled in response, and that it had reinforced troops and its aerial defense system along the border following the flare-up.\n\nThe military provided few details about the reason for the raid.

Since late March, Hamas has been leading mass marches, with turnout driven by growing despair in Gaza, to try to break the border blockade. The blockade has led to over 50 percent unemployment and chronic power outages, and prevents the vast majority of Gazans from traveling.\n\nMore than 170 demonstrators, most unarmed, have been killed by Israeli army fire in the confrontations, in which some of the participants threw stones, burned tires or hurled grenades toward Israeli forces.\n\nIsrael says it is defending its border against militant infiltrations, but its army has come under international criticism because of the large number of unarmed protesters who have been shot.\n\nLast week, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million in aid to Gaza\u2019s cash-strapped Hamas rulers. Hamas responded by lowering the intensity of the border protest last Friday.\n\nOn Sunday, Netanyahu defended his decision to allow through the Qatari cash to Gaza as a way to avert an \u201cunnecessary war,\u201d maintain quiet for residents of southern Israel and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in the impoverished Gaza Strip.", "WalletHub, the personal finance website, commemorated Veteran\u2019s Day by releasing its annual ranking of the best and worst U.S. cities for former service men and women to put down roots.\n\nAustin, Texas, topped 2018\u2019s Best and Worst Places for Veterans to Live as the overall best U.S. city for military veterans to live, a distinction which the Texas capital city held for the second consecutive year. Rounding out the top five were two Arizona cities \u2014 Scottsdale (#2) and Gilbert (#5) \u2014 as well as Colorado Springs, Colorado (#3); and Raleigh, North Carolina (#4).\n\n\n\nThe 10 worst cities for veterans included Ohio metros \u2014 Cleveland (#92) and Toledo (#95). California contributed San Bernardino (#94) and Fresno (#97). Also at the bottom of the pack were Philadelphia (#91), Baton Rouge (#93), Baltimore (#96), Memphis (#98), Newark (#99), and Detroit (#100).\n\nWalletHub analysts determined their \u201cbest and worst\u201d picks by comparing 100 of the nation\u2019s largest cities using 18 metrics such as veteran friendliness, percentage of military skill-related jobs, affordable housing, and availability of VA health facilities which they catalogued into four main categories \u2013 employment, economy, quality of life, and health. The study also ranked how cities performed in numerous subgroups.\n\nPlano, Texas, experienced the lowest veteran unemployment rate at 2.4 percent, which was 6.5 times lower than Detroit, the city with the highest unemployment rate at 15.6 percent. Plano, a Dallas suburb, ranked as sixth overall best city for veterans, followed by Virginia Beach, Virginia (#7); Irvine, California (#8); and Florida\u2019s Tampa (#9) and Orlando (#10).\n\nVirginia Beach had the highest veteran population of 130.4, which was 15.3 times greater than Hialeah, Florida, with only 8.51 veterans, according to the study. Although Hialeah, a Miami suburb, rated poorly (#97) on its percentage of military skill-related jobs, it had the lowest percent of veterans living below the poverty line. Stockton, California, with only 1.91 percent of impoverished former military members, placed second to the South Florida city.\n\nThe highest veteran income growth resulted in a five-way tie among Hialeah, Birmingham, Alabama; Miami; Reno, Nevada; and Irving, Texas. Conversely, the California cities of Long Beach (#96), Riverside (#97), and Irvine (#100) and the Texas municipalities of Garland (#98) and Laredo (#99) saw the lowest veteran income growth in the nation.\n\nFremont, California, and Madison, Wisconsin, tied for the top U.S. metros with the highest percentage of military skill-related jobs. Miami (#99) and North Las Vegas (#100) had the lowest.\n\nIn October, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated 18.2 million veterans resided stateside based on 2017 statistics. Of these, approximately 1.6 million were females who served in the military. Additionally, 50 percent of veterans were age 65 and older while only 8.9 percent were younger than age 35. Furthermore, the number of U.S. military veterans dropped from 21.8 million in 2016.\n\nWalletHub determined the fewest numbers of homeless veterans resided in Virginia Beach (#1) followed by Birmingham (#2), Jacksonville, Florida (#3); Riverside, California (#4), and Raleigh (#5). Homelessness plagued veterans in three California metros \u2014 Los Angeles, Long Beach, and San Francisco \u2013 as well as in Honolulu and Atlanta.\n\nIn 2018, the number of homeless veterans, in general, dropped about five percent after rising one year earlier, according to Military Times. Previously, the publication noted that an increase in veteran homelessness during 2017 reflected estimates from \u201cbefore President Donald Trump took office and any of his new housing policies were put in place.\u201d\n\nQuality of care in the VA healthcare system has been a high profile sore spot. Health IT Analytics reported the system, criticized for its \u201cstaggeringly long wait times\u201d and \u201cmassive backlog\u201d of benefit claims for disabled veterans, was \u201crocked by scandal\u201d in 2013 when several patient deaths were blamed on the \u201csystematic flaws in the electronic patient scheduling process.\u201d The online healthcare publication estimated 71 percent of VA medical centers identified problems and applied fixes to raise their quality of care over the past year.\n\nStill, in June, the president signed into law the VA Mission Act to replace the troubled Veterans Choice Program, expanding private healthcare options for veterans.

The names of the soldiers were not immediately released.\n\nRead more here.", "Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources,\u201d host Brian Stelter questioned if the news media underappreciated the \u201cstrength of the blue wave\u201d at the midterm election.\n\n\u201cDid the news media underappreciate the strength of the blue wave in the House on Tuesday night? Five days later, it sure looks that way,\u201d Stelter opened the segment. \u201cBack on Tuesday, wave spotters said the midterms were not delivering the huge repudiation of President Trump that the Democrats wanted to deliver.\u201d\n\nStelter noted how CNN\u2019s Van Jones called the results of Tuesday\u2019s election \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d but then said a \u201cblue wave\u201d is \u201cbecoming more true every day\u201d since votes are still being counted.\n\n\u201cVotes are still being counted in Arizona, and California, and other states and recounts are taking place. So it now appears the Democrats will pick up at least 35 seats in the House. I mean, here\u2019s the map already. They\u2019re already far ahead of the 23 they needed in the House,\u201d he stated.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "It is \u201ccruel and unscientific\u201d to define a person\u2019s legal sex by their biology, says a pro-transgender complaint signed by 98 Democratic House legislators.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 statement was sent to President Donald Trump\u2019s administration after the New York Times reported that the administration will formally clarify that the sex of people involved in sex-discrimination legal fights will be based on their male or female body.\n\nTrump\u2019s biology-determines-sex policy \u201cmakes it clear that members of this administration are willing to \u2026 solidify an archaic, dogmatic, and alarming view of the world,\u201d the Democrats complain their letter to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nThe Democrats and transgender advocates want government agencies to let people define their legal sex by declaring their internal feeling of male or female \u201cgender identity,\u201d regardless of their male or female body and biology.\n\nYet there is no scientific or legal measure of \u201cgender identity.\u201d For example, one gay advocacy group defines gender identity as \u201cOne\u2019s innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither.\u201d So any person could claim to have an opposite-sex \u201cgender identity\u201d and become a member of the other sex at any time, for as long or short a time as they wish.\n\nThis identity-beats-biology change would erase any recognition of biological women and biological men from the law. For example, the transgender ideology says the idea of \u201cwomen\u201d would include men and women who say they have a female \u201cgender identity.\u201d Women who insist they are women would be redefined as \u201ccis-gender women,\u201d say transgender advocates.\n\nIf gender defines sex, the nation\u2019s anti-discrimination laws will force agencies, civic organizations, and cultural groups to bar recognition of the partly-different and complementary preferences and attributes of males and females.\n\nThis revolutionary change would have profound consequences. For one minor example, a female theater director could face an anti-discrimination lawsuit if she repeatedly chooses women to play the female leads in Romeo and Juliet, even when the show is aimed at a female audience. In November, the company that sells Victoria\u2019s Secret lingerie products was slammed because it does not use a mix of interchangeable men and women to model their clothing for women.\n\nAlready, women are being erased from women\u2019s sporting competitions when supposedly \u201ctransgender\u201d men muscle their way to the winners\u2019 podium.\n\nThe 98 Democrats include Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy, Kentucky Rep. John Yarmuth, Connecticut\u2019s Reps. Elizabeth Esty and Joe Courtney, New Jersey Reps. Frank Pallone and Donald Norcross, Oregon Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, Maine Rep. Chellie Pingree, Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett, New York Reps. Sean Patrick Maloney and Brian Higgins, California Rep. Scott Peters, Pennsylvania Reps. Brendan Boyle and Robert Brady, Washington Rep. Derek Kilmer, Minnesota Rep. Rick Nolan, and Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley.\n\nRep. Kennedy is chairman of a Transgender Equality Task Force panel in Congress.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s biology-determines-sex policy would preserve the nation\u2019s existing law and culture that accepts the near-universal view that that women and men are legally equal but also different and complementary. For example, the Pentagon has dropped former President Barack Obama\u2019s pro-transgender policies and is now using the \u201cbright line\u201d of biology to determine each soldiers\u2019 male or female status.\n\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m doing? I\u2019m protecting everybody,\u201d Trump said October 22. \u201cWe have a lot of different concepts right now. They have a lot of different things happening with respect to transgender, right now.\u201d\n\nTrump is reversing Obama's push for 'transgender rights.' But transgenderism seeks to erase any recognition of female & male bodies in law & culture. So Trump is now the nation's leading champion of women's legal recognition & rights. Ironic for feminists. https://t.co/yE3TIzNotZ \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) November 4, 2018\n\nThis biology-based perspective is seen everywhere in society. For example, TV producers carefully design their shows to appeal to the different tastes of men or women, and TV advertisers tune their commercials to match their female or male targets. In politics, feminists complain about male-to-female pay gaps, discrimination in work, and women\u2019s healthcare priorities.\n\nThe Democrats argue that the existence of a small percentage of people who have subtle genetic variations invalidates the long-standing and universal recognition that nearly all people have either male or female bodies and preferences.\n\nDefining a person\u2019s sex by biology is \u201ccruel and unscientific,\u201d says the 98 Democrats. The Democrats insist that basing sex on biology \u201ccounters the consensus of medical providers and scientists across the globe who have found no reliable evidence to support such a [biological] definition.\u201d\n\nThe letter also gaslights Americans by pretending that the law already defines sex by \u201cgender identity.\u201d This pretense allows the Democrats to claim that Trump\u2019s \u201cre-defining [sex] raises countless practical, legal, and medical questions.\u201d\n\nFor example, the 98 Democrats claim that men and women will lose protections against sexual discrimination if legal sex is gauged by biology:\n\nThis proposal intended to erase transgender people from federal civil rights protection and eviscerate enforcement of non-discrimination laws \u2026 Under this proposal, it is possible for a transgender person to be denied access to medical care or health insurance or be refused access to emergency shelter or public housing, and transgender children could be denied access to public education \u2026 We demand a complete rejection of this shameless attempt to eliminate the rights of transgender people.\n\nAll people are now protected by anti-discrimination rules regardless of their personalities or sex.\n\nBut there is a growing number of legal disputes being created by progressives\u2019 insistence that men are entitled to be women. In October, Breitbart News reported:\n\nNine women have filed a lawsuit against a Fresno homeless shelter, accusing the nonprofit of allowing a transgender biological man claiming to be a woman to sexually harass them. \u2026 According to the lawsuit, each of the nine homeless women were staying at Naomi\u2019s House \u2013 part of the shelter\u2019s main campus in Fresno \u2013 in November 2017. The shelter\u2019s rules require all women to shower daily. Though the shelter provides individual shower stalls, the women dress and undress in a common area. A \u201cmale who identifies as female,\u201d and identified in the complaint by his initials, was also residing at Naomi\u2019s House at the time. During the times when the women were dressing and undressing in the common area, the lawsuit claims the biological man made lewd comments to them about their breasts and other body parts. Some of the women charged the man was peering at them in the showers between the cracks in the stalls.\n\nThese conflicts have been ignored by establishment media outlets.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, however, a spectrum of political advocates have begun debating the civic impact of redefining sex as \u201cgender identity.\u201d In October, the left-wing Guardian newspaper published an editorial saying that women\u2019s rights are threatened by the transgender ideology:\n\nWhile campaigners for trans rights are entitled to push for laws that they believe advance equality, feminists are entitled to question whether such changes could adversely affect other women. Neither group is a homogeneous bloc and there are more than two points of view. \u2026 Women\u2019s concerns about sharing dormitories or changing rooms with \u201cmale-bodied\u201d people must be taken seriously. These are not just questions of safety but of dignity and fairness. \u2026 The public needs to be better informed, and safeguarding considered. The sex-based protections in the Equality Act, like case-by-case decision-making in the Prison Service, only work if service providers have adequate guidance and training. Where changes have been introduced or are proposed, including in prisons, women should be consulted.\n\nIn response, several U.S.-based reporters for the Guardian denounced their editors\u2019 defense of women\u2019s rights and insisted that feminism denies women the right to object when men reach for women\u2019s legal status:\n\nThe editorial used a UK legal debate about IDs to argue that trans rights \u201ccollide\u201d with cis women\u2019s rights; that equality for trans women \u201ccould adversely affect other women\u201d; and that allowing trans women to access public spaces threatens cis women\u2019s \u201csafety\u201d. These arguments were met with particular dismay in the US as they echo the position of anti-trans legislators who have pushed overtly transphobic bathroom bills. \u2026 [W]omen\u2019s intolerance should not be a legitimate reason for limiting the rights of trans women. The idea that all trans women should be denied civil rights \u2026 is the essence of bigotry and goes against feminist values.\n\nThe reporters described their mission as advocacy for minorities, not truth-telling or explaining the concerns of a democratic majority:\n\nThe Guardian has a proud history of fighting for the voiceless, the vulnerable and the disenfranchised. It was with that legacy in mind that our journalists who write and edit stories on LGBTQIA rights, women\u2019s rights, politics, immigration, technology, business, criminal justice, gun policy and more decided to publicly voice our concern. Some of us have also seen first-hand the discrimination and violence trans women face.\n\nThe reporters also lamented that advocates for the transgender ideology are refusing to talk to them because of the editorial:\n\nThe Guardian in the US is committed to covering this important civil rights fight, but when the time came for us to report on Trump\u2019s attacks, we encountered problems. Some trans people wouldn\u2019t talk to us. That\u2019s because, days earlier, the Guardian published an editorial that we believe promoted transphobic viewpoints, including some of the same assertions about gender that US politicians are citing in their push to eliminate trans rights.\n\nThe transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents. In 2017, Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency. Multiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology\u2019s claim that a person\u2019s legal sex is determined by their feeling of \u201cgender identity,\u201d not by biology.\n\nThe transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have different goals and priorities. It includes sexual liberationists, progressives, feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes, and people who glamorize the distinctions between the two sexes. It includes high-profile children, people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex, and people trying to \u201cdetransition\u201d back to their sex, men who demand sex from lesbians, masculine autogynephiles, wealthy donors, politicians, political professionals, and medical service providers.\n\nVery few people who describe themselves as transgender undergo cosmetic surgery of the genitals. Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study.\n\nYet the gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies. In Ohio, for example, in February, a judge forced parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she can begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that will allow her to appear as a male.\n\nThe progressive push to bend Americans\u2019 attitudes and their male and female civic society around the idea of \u201cgender identity\u201d has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules that help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.\n\nThese pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents\u2019 rights in childrearing, children\u2019s safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women\u2019s ideals of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men\u2019s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children\u2019s sexual privacy.", "During a Sunday interview on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Sen.

Prior to her stint with Feinstein, Herwig served as counselor to Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\n\nAccording to emails released by the Justice Department, Herwig was included in a chain of emails crafting the initial media response into Lynch\u2019s infamous tarmac meeting at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in which former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the FBI\u2019s main subject in a criminal probe, boarded the attorney general\u2019s plane and reportedly stayed there for about 20 minutes.\n\nDemand Justice\u2019s formation was encouraged by former Obama White House counselor John Podesta, who served as chairman of Clinton\u2019s latest presidential campaign. \u201cWe have ignored this field of battle for too long,\u201d Podesta told the New York Times regarding Demand Justice.\n\nEven before Trump announced Kavanaugh as his nominee, Demand Justice committed to spending about $5 million to oppose the eventual nominee. The organization seeks to raise $10 million in its first year.\n\nIn a recent interview with the New York Times, Fallon would not comment on the source of the group\u2019s financing, but the newspaper noted that he was a featured speaker at the conference of the Democracy Alliance, a grouping of progressive donors.\n\nDemocracy Alliance\u2019s founding donors include Soros and billionaire Tom Steyer.

Guess who?\n\nAs The Washington Post reported on Sunday, \u201cIn the shadow of a grand war memorial here, French President Emmanuel Macron marked the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I by delivering a forceful rebuke against rising nationalism, calling it a \u2018betrayal of patriotism\u2019 and warning against \u2018old demons coming back to wreak chaos and death.\u2019\u201d For much of Sunday, that article was the \u201cMost Read\u201d story on the Post\u2019s website\u2014of course it was.\n\nObviously Macron was aiming his rebuke at President Trump, who was sitting just a few feet away. After all, Trump said just three weeks ago, \u201cI am a nationalist.\u201d And so Macron further jibed on on Sunday, \u201cPatriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism.\u201d\n\nThe exact opposite? Really? The reader might be inclined to reach for a dictionary, in search of the difference between those two words, \u201cpatriotism\u201d and \u201cnationalism.\u201d Actually, don\u2019t bother, because they are, in fact, interchangeable.\n\nMacron\u2019s wordplay was dismissed by John O\u2019Sullivan, who\u2019s been a conservative sage since his days as an aide to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. O\u2019Sullivan responded to Macron with a tart tweet, \u201cNonsense. Patriotism & nationalism overlap greatly as political ideas arising from love of country. Those who want to separate them fully get into linguistic difficulties & produce wildly differing definitions of both.\u201d In other words, in his eagerness to zap Trump, Macron is splitting hairs.\n\nNonsense. Patriotism & nationalism overlap greatly as political ideas arising from love of country. Those who want to separate them fully get into linguistic difficulties & produce wildly differing definitions of both. Think: I'm a patriot, you're a nationalist, he's a chauvinist https://t.co/aQ7G8hrLOL \u2014 John O'Sullivan (@JohnOSullivanNR) November 11, 2018\n\nTo be sure, plenty of folks will cheerfully defend nationalism, or patriotism, or both\u2014including, just last month, Virgil\u2013but there\u2019s more to the story here than words. There\u2019s also a struggle for power.\n\nYou see, even as Macron is zapping Trump for being a nationalist, the French president will be pushing, in Trump\u2019s absence, a whole new initiative built around\u2014you guessed it\u2014globalism. As the Post also reported, \u201cThe president plans to fly home just as Macron\u2019s Paris Peace Forum kicks off for three days of meetings aimed at galvanizing global action on shared challenges, such as climate change.\u201d The Post quoted Thomas Wright, a Europe expert at the Brookings Institution, saying that Macron planned the Paris Peace Forum as \u201ca counterpoint to \u2018America First.\u2019\u201d Thus we can see: All the \u201cMacron Attacks Trump\u201d headlines are part of a deliberate strategy.\n\nOne might think that Macron would be better off tending to his own popularity in France. After all, he\u2019s down to 29 percent approval, and his plan for a new green-inspired fuel tax is widely reviled; just this month he was roundly booed while visiting an auto factory.\n\nIndeed, Macron has set his sights on a bigger prize than France; he wants to be the leader of the \u201cinternational community.\u201d Now that German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s star has fallen, Macron figures that he can fill her shoes, rallying internationalists and scourging nationalists\u2014starting with Trump.\n\nSo maybe we should take a closer look at Macron\u2019s new venture, the Paris Peace Forum, which will be meeting through November 13. It even has its own website, dedicated to \u201creviving and improving global governance.\u201d (No wonder Trump left.)\n\nWe can pretty much predict what this Paris conclave will be talking about; it will be mostly idealistic globaloney, except when the speaker needs a jolt of applause, in which case, it\u2019ll be Trump-bashing.\n\nSo it might seem that there\u2019s not much need to think about this conference further. Except for one thing: We can learn a lot by clicking on the Paris Peace Forum tab called \u201cPartners.\u201d There, we can learn who is paying for all this.\n\nAnd with that click, we\u2019ll see some familiar names. Under \u201cMain Partners\u201d and \u201cGrand Partners,\u201d we see such liberal reliables as the Carnegie Corporation, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Open Society Foundations. That last group, of course, is the outfit founded and funded by George Soros; just in 2017, he gave his philanthropic tool another $18 billion. So we can see: Macron has done a great job of rounding up the usual suspects of limousine liberalism.\n\nMoreover, the Silicon Valley tech lords are well represented, too, starting with Facebook. It was just last year, after all, that CEO Mark Zuckerberg published a manifesto aimed at saving the world, and so the Facebook reps in Paris should be rapturously received. Google and Microsoft are partners, too, making it a safe bet that the words coming from the Paris meeting will include no meaningful criticism of Big Tech.\n\nIndeed, a further look shows that the Paris Peace Forum has received donations from a large number of multinational corporations, banks, and law firms. Yes, there\u2019s a lot of money gathered in the City of Lights; after all, globalism isn\u2019t just a utopian ideology, it\u2019s also a big business. And, of course, the media are well represented, too; one such partner is The New York Times.\n\nYet it\u2019s also interesting to see that many of the partners are international organizations. Yup, there are a bunch of \u2018em, including the International Energy Agency, the International Monetary Fund, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nAlso noteworthy are the many United Nations entities, including the International Labor Organization, the United Nations Development Programme, and UNESCO.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly interesting here, as well, is that American taxpayers are paying much of the freight for all these groups. It\u2019s not surprising, of course, that globalcrats want more institutional \u201cturf.\u201d And yet it is startling to contemplate how much of this turf-building is being paid for by the U.S.\n\nFor example, the annual budget for the U.N. is about $2.7 billion, of which the U.S. pays 22 percent, or $600 million.

The bill passed with no Democrat support.

After more than four years of bloody fighting, the Great War was finally over.\n\nThe standard view of World War I is that it is a testament to the futility of war. Yet maybe the better way to think of the war, which lasted from 1914 to 1918\u2014including American participation in 1917-1918\u2014is that if war comes, it\u2019s better to win than to lose.\n\nSo while any war is a cause for somber reflection\u2014and world leaders, including President Trump, are gathered in France this weekend to reflect on World War I\u2014it\u2019s perhaps even more important to learn enduring lessons of preparedness and strength.\n\nMost of the chronicling of that war is heavy on mournfulness, along with the implication that war solves nothing. Hence we see headlines such as \u201cThe Tragic Futility of World War I\u201d and \u201cThe Most Unnecessary War in History.\u201d\n\nStill, we are left to wonder: If the war was \u201cfutile\u201d and \u201cunnecessary,\u201d does that mean it would have made no difference if, for instance, the U.S. had not fought in it? Would it have been okay if the Kaiser\u2019s Germany had won?\n\nAnd for that matter, what about France? That was the country that the German Army invaded in 1914, and, following the notorious Schlieffen Plan, the Germans stormed through a neutral country, Belgium, as part of their drive toward Paris. So what should the French have done, other than defend themselves? If one says that the French could have done a better job of planning and preparing for the war, that\u2019s certainly true. But pacifism, in the face of a conqueror, is not a good option.\n\nBack then, the Germans had their Schlieffen Plan, which was a cynical violation of international law; attacking neutral countries is a no-no. For their part, the French had Plan XVII, which was the right idea, done the wrong way. Plan XVII was unwise because it attempted to convert the glorious idea of military bravery\u2014attaque \u00e0 outrance (attack to excess)\u2014into a formal military doctrine. That is, the French war planners had convinced themselves that their brave soldiers could overcome the enemy through \u00e9lan, and so that was all that was needed; the French would charge, bayonets fixed, and win with cold steel.\n\nYes, French soldiers were plenty brave, but so, too\u2014looking back to military history\u2014were the American Confederates who launched Pickett\u2019s Charge at Gettysburg in 1863, and they, too, failed. By the mid-19th century, the evolution of the needle gun had given rise to rapid-fire riflery, which meant that infantry and cavalry charges were both more costly and less likely to succeed. Moreover, advances in artillery were devastating, also, to mass formations. Finally, by the early 20th century, the machine gun was being deployed.\n\nYet despite all these deadly technological innovations, generals were reluctant to give up on their old ways. They were no different from everyone else\u2014we\u2019re all creatures of habit. So during the opening weeks of the war, in August and September 1914, generals ordered charges just as they had done in battles for thousands of years; only now, the results were disastrously different.\n\nIn particular, French soldiers, obedient to their Plan XVII, and wearing easy-to-see bright blue tunics and red pantaloons, went charging at the Germans\u2014and the result, of course, was disaster. The overconfident French were decimated, and only a last-minute rally\u2014the so-called Miracle of the Marne\u2014stopped the Germans from capturing Paris.\n\nBy now, mid-September 1914, all the combatants in the West\u2014the French, British, and Belgians against the Germans\u2014were beginning to comprehend that the nature of war had taken a decisive turn. The new ways of delivering firepower, combined with additional innovations such as barbed wire and echeloned entrenchment, made rapid offense difficult, if not impossible. Yet not every military leader got the message; during the war, millions of lives were lost as armies persisted with lethally ineffective frontal assaults.\n\nStill, in the years that followed, nations increasingly relied on their industrial power to supplement the blood-sacrifice of their soldiers. It\u2019s estimated, for example, that from 1914 to 1918, the warring countries fired between 900 million and 1.2 billion artillery shells at each other. In the meantime, other technological advances were emerging from various nations\u2019 military-industrial complexes, including the submarine, the flamethrower, and poison gas. Once again, the impact of these new weapons was to make it all the more obvious that the old ways of warfare were obsolete.\n\nYet we can also observe that new killing machines did not make war \u201cfutile,\u201d or \u201cunnecessary,\u201d for the simple reason that even if the technology of war had changed, the psychology of war had not. Some leaders and peoples still wanted to fight, for reasons ranging from injured honor to outright avarice.\n\nWe can pause to observe that warlike sentiments have been painfully visible throughout human history; the wise have always known this. In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul lamented: \u201cNone is righteous \u2026 Their feet are swift to shed blood; in their paths are ruin and misery, and the way of peace they have not known.\u201d Two thousand years later, it\u2019s hard to say that anything much has changed.\n\nSo we can see: If the world contains many lions, it\u2019s not a good idea to be a lamb. The Roman military strategist Vegetius had it right in the fourth century: If you want peace, prepare for war.\n\nAnd so as we think about America\u2019s role in World War I, we should rightly think of the heroes of that conflict, such as Alvin York, further immortalized in the 1941 film starring Gary Cooper. We should also think of the 116,516 Americans who gave their lives, including a Marine private, Foster Stevens, recently remembered in The Washington Post. Indeed, all those millions who served merit our attention and respect, including Oscar Rhoades of Wilkes County, North Carolina, who came home and lived another 70 years.\n\nYet precisely because we remember past heroes, we should be thinking constantly about the safety of future heroes. The first way to assure their safety, of course, is to avoid unnecessary wars, including wars of choice, but sometimes, inevitably, without any fault of our own, war will come.\n\nWorld War I was such a war. That conflict was so awful, in terms of carnage, that it is tempting to conclude, as many have, that it was \u201cfutile\u201d and \u201cunnecessary.\u201d According to this popular line of thinking, the fighting was all a tragic misunderstanding, and so as a solution for the future, the thinking goes, let\u2019s all have better understanding\u2014let\u2019s communicate more.\n\nAlas, while such thinking might be tempting, it is not correct. The truth is that Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany understood full well that he was plunging Europe into war in 1914; he had his eyes wide open, and he welcomed the conflict, because he thought he could win. As we have seen, Germany happily trampled through neutral Belgium on its way to France; at least 123,000 Belgians died as a result. Indeed, Germany\u2019s \u201cSeptember Plan\u201d proved that the Kaiser and his aides had high hopes for seizing control of all of Europe. Thus he, more than anyone else, is responsible for 15 million deaths.\n\nMoreover, the Kaiser, personally, was a warmongering hothead, given to making bloodthirsty speeches to his soldiers, such as, \u201cShould you encounter the enemy, he will be defeated! No quarter will be given! Prisoners will not be taken! Whoever falls into your hands is forfeited. Just as a thousand years ago the Huns under their King Attila made a name for themselves, one that even today makes them seem mighty in history and legend, may the name \u2018German\u2019 be affirmed by you.\u201d\n\nIt is also worth recalling that Germany\u2019s imperial ambitions were not limited to Europe; Germany was interested, too, in fomenting war in North America\u2014against the U.S.A. The so-called Zimmermann Telegram was sent by the German foreign secretary, Arthur Zimmermann, in January 1917 to the German ambassador to Mexico; the goal was to entice Mexico into declaring war on the United States.\n\nOf course, the idea of Mexico militarily attacking the U.S. might have been a crazy fantasy, and yet it speaks volumes about the mindset of the Kaiser\u2019s regime. The British intercepted the telegram in February; Zimmermann truthfully, but idiotically, confirmed its contents in March\u2014and President Woodrow Wilson asked for, and received, a Congressional declaration of war against Germany in April. (The vote in the Senate was 82:6; in the House, 373:50.)\n\nSo we can see: America\u2019s participation in what was then known as the Great War was inevitable. If we wished to remain a great and honorable power, we had no choice but to stand up to great and dishonorable threats.\n\nYet not everything about the way we fought the war was great. Most obviously, we were militarily ill-prepared. When the first units of the American Expeditionary Force reached the front in October 1917, our doughboys were ready to fight, but they lacked the new essentials of military success.\n\nYes, they had plenty of food and rifles, but they were not ready in terms of advanced equipment and military doctrine. Fighting had been raging for more than three years, and yet the American generals, from commander John J. Pershing on down, had not really absorbed the lessons of, yes, the machine gun and rapid-fire artillery. So we went into battle just as the French had in 1914\u2014overconfident and under-prepared. American casualties, as a result, were far heavier than they had to be.\n\nAnd so we come to the two most important weapons to emerge from World War I: the tank and the airplane. And thereby hangs a particularly disturbing tale of American unreadiness.\n\nFrustrated by the stalemate of trench warfare, the British had been experimenting with \u201cland dreadnoughts\u201d as early as 1915. Tanks were, in fact, a genius solution to the stalemate, and they ultimately helped make the breakthroughs that enabled the Allies to win the war. And yet here\u2019s the thing: The Americans never produced a single tank that fought in the war.\n\nEven after the British started deploying them on the battlefield, American military planners just sat there, watching, from afar, with incomprehension. And this dithering is all the more remarkable since the U.S. was home to the Ford Motor Company, which had pioneered the assembly line. In fact, in 1916, the last peacetime year for the U.S., Henry Ford and his automotive rivals had built 1.3 million cars. So we had the productive capacity to make tanks, we just didn\u2019t have the vision.\n\nTo be sure, some Americans did grasp the importance of the tank, including Captain (later Major) George S. Patton. But during the war, Patton and his fellow tankers had to fight in French and British tanks.\n\nA similarly infuriating tale can be told about American aviation in the war. The airplane had, of course, been invented in the U.S., and the Army did use airplanes for its Signal Corps. And yet once again, top commanders were obtuse about the need for American-made combat aircraft. And so during the war, American fighter ace Eddie Rickenbacker flew the French-made Nieuport 28, while other Americans pilots flew another French make, the SPAD S.VII.\n\nSo what went wrong? How could the U.S., boasting the largest economy in the world, let itself be flummoxed on the basics of military production? Well, that\u2019s a good question; perhaps the biggest single reason is that the Wilson administration chose to run war production with a series of boards and administrations; the result was a bureaucratic mess.\n\nOf course, in the end, Uncle Sam prevailed. The Germans were exhausted, and our forces, despite their homefront handicaps, fought well.\n\nIn fact, it can even be said that there was a silver lining to U.S. underperformance in World War I. Two decades later, when World War II was brewing, American war leaders, military and civilian alike, were determined to do better. Indeed, American war production in the Second World War was the envy of the world; most obviously, we built 108,000 tanks\u2014a lot more than the zero of the previous war\u2014which Patton and his fellow commanders used most effectively.\n\nAnd oh yes, we built 324,000 airplanes\u2014again, that\u2019s a lot more than the previous zero. (In 2017, Breitbart News paid tribute to some of those homefront defense workers, the men and women who built the B-24 Liberator at Willow Run, Michigan, here, and here.)\n\nSo to what should we attribute this enormous success\u2014in such sharp contrast to the dismal precedent of just two decades earlier? One answer is detailed by the historian Arthur Herman in his 2012 book, Freedom\u2019s Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II. In contrast to the Wilson administration\u2019s emphasis on bureaucratic committees, the Roosevelt administration appointed a series of no-nonsense \u201cczars\u201d to oversee production.\n\nOf course, in contrast to World War I, nobody dares say that World War II was \u201cfutile\u201d or \u201cunnecessary.\u201d By 1941, when the U.S. entered the war, it was obvious that Hitler and his ilk were so evil, and so threatening, that we had no choice other than to fight. Fortunately, once we did start fighting, we were ready.\n\nSo we can see: Once you\u2019re in a war of national survival, there\u2019s no point in thinking about whether it\u2019s \u201cfutile\u201d or \u201cunnecessary.\u201d Instead, the point is to win it, with as few casualties as possible\u2014or, more precisely, with as few casualties on your side as possible. As George Patton\u2014by then Lt. General Patton\u2014said in 1943, \u201cNo dumb bastard ever won a war by going out and dying for his country. He won it by making some other dumb bastard die for his country.\u201d\n\nWith that sort of mindset, backed up by the best technology, America will always have the military muscle it needs. The hope is that robust American armed forces will persuade potential foes that it is a bad idea to fight the United States. We want everyone else thinking that war with the U.S. is, indeed, \u201cfutile.\u201d\n\nBut of course, hope is never enough in world affairs. So we must always be prepared for war. As the ancient Roman Vegetius knew, preparation for war is the best preparation for peace. We can pray that all wars we fight are necessary wars, but we must prepare, too, so that we can win them all.", "Mexican authorities arrested a top ranking Sinaloa Cartel operator responsible for coordinating the flow of cocaine and cash to the U.S. from Colombia and Mexico. The drug lord had armed bodyguards with Mexican police credentials at the time of his arrest.\n\nMexican federal authorities confirmed the arrest of Angel Humberto \u201cDon Angel\u201d Chavez Gastelum and his son Alonso Jaime \u201cRito\u201d Gastelum Salazar. The arrests came as the two had dinner at an upscale restaurant in the central Mexican state of Queretaro. Mexican military forces carried out the operation with intelligence information provided by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Breitbart News obtained access to after-action reports revealing that the Gastelum family had a squad of bodyguards with them who had forged documents to pass themselves off as law enforcement officials. Mexican authorities are expected to hold Gastelum until his extradition process is completed.\n\nWhile the elder Gastelum claimed to be a businessman, he is wanted in the Central District Court of California on dozens of drug trafficking and conspiracy charges. He is also wanted for money laundering and murder, court documents revealed. Gastelum is linked to the Sinaloa Cartel but operated in a semi-independent fashion by establishing a low profile organization that operated largely under the radar. Gastelum is believed to have helped top Sinaloa Cartel bosses Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman and Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada launder millions.

This week President Trump on immigration has issued orders bypassing Congress to restrict how migrants crossing the border illegally can claim asylum. Are you OK with that now?\n\nCRUZ: Well I\u2019m still studying this specific immigration order, but I\u2019ll tell you look, here\u2019s my view on executive orders\u2013\n\nBRENNAN: But bypassing Congress?\u2013\n\nCRUZ: Well let- let me explain my view on- on executive orders whether from Trump or Obama, George W. Bush or anybody else, which is there is a legitimate role for an executive order, and that is governing how the Executive Branch operates. How under Article II of the Constitution the president of the Executive Branch is charged with- with taking- taking due care that the laws are faithfully executed. And an executive order is perfectly appropriate to direct the Executive Branch. This is the manner in which we shall execute the law. What Obama did repeatedly that was so lawless is his executive orders didn\u2019t do that. Instead, they said here is the federal law passed by Congress signed by the president that we will defy, that we will ignore, and- and that the president can\u2019t do. And- and so that\u2019s the question on any executive order is-is it- is it directing how the executive will behave or is it flying in defiance to- to laws passed by Congress. If it\u2019s the latter, it\u2019s unconstitutional.\n\nBRENNAN: So I- I don\u2019t hear a clear answer on whether you think this asylum change is OK. Do you think via executive order, it is appropriate for the president to end birthright citizenship, again bypassing Congress?\n\nCRUZ: Well- well- well Margaret as I said on- on the- on the executive order on immigration I have not studied that order yet, it just came out this week. You know I have to admit I- I was kind of busy, we had an election a couple of days ago. And- and- and that- that so, I have not yet reviewed the executive order, and I try on legal decisions \u2013 my career has been being a constitutional litigator, so I- I don\u2019t- I don\u2019t reach constitutional opinions lightly. If the order defies the laws of Congress, then yes it\u2019s unconstitutional. If the order constrains and directs how the executive will implement the law then it\u2019s not. Now my understanding is this executive order does things directing resources to the border. Those resources are clearly within the purview of an executive order for the president \u2014\n\nBRENNAN: And birthright citizenship executive order that\u2019s coming\u2013\n\nCRUZ: And the president is charged under existing law\u2013 The- The president is charged under executive un-under federal law with securing the border, and if the executive order is in furtherance of the statute then it\u2019s not only allowable, it- it- it\u2019s appropriate and good. I mean this so-called migrant caravan of over 10,000 people marching North, declaring their intention to cross the border illegally. I can tell you I told the president just recently when he and I spoke. I said Mr. President under no circumstances should we let them cross, we should use whatever tools are available, whether it is border patrol whether it is National Guard whether- whether it is the military that the president has called up, but we shouldn\u2019t allow 10,000 people to blatantly and deliberately violate the law.

This tally of the counts and estimates of direct deaths caused by war violence does not include the more than 500,000 deaths from the war in Syria, raging since 2011, which the US joined in August 2014. The wars are ongoing, although the wars in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq are less intense than in recent years. Still, the number of civilians killed in Afghanistan in 2018 is on track to be one of the highest death tolls in the war.\n\nBrown University\u2019s updated fatality tally this year includes U.S. troops (6,951); American civilians and contractors (7,841); local police and military units (109,154); allied troops (1,464); civilians (244,124- 266,427); opposition fighters (109,396- 114,471); journalists/media workers (362); aid workers (566).\n\nIn the course of the war on terror, which started in October 2001, there have been an estimated 147,124 deaths in Afghanistan, 64,942 in Pakistan, as well as between 267,792 and 295,170 in Iraq, the study showed.\n\nThe majority of deaths in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq are driven by the local security forces and civilians.\n\nThe Pentagon, at the behest of the Afghan government, has stopped reporting fatalities involving Afghan security forces.\n\nBrown University\u2019s most recent war on terror death toll shows a 22 percent increase in deaths over the past two years, Voice of America (VOA) pointed out.\n\nAccording to the study, the post-9/11 wars have imposed a profound human cost on Americans: \u201cNearly 7,000 U.S.\u201d military fatalities and \u201cmore than 53,700\u201d injuries.\u201d\n\nThe war in Afghanistan has reportedly killed an estimated 2,401 U.S. troops while the conflict in Iraq has resulted in the death of about 4,550 others.\n\nBrown University further noted:\n\nMany other US soldiers have become amputees. From the start of the wars through mid-2015, there were 1,645 major limb amputations for US service members associated with battle injuries in the major war zones.36 As the number of troops deployed in the war zones have declined, so have major limb amputations. In 2016, there were no major limb amputations, the first year since the wars began. The Congressional Research Service has stopped releasing regular updates on US military casualty statistics.

Sunday will mark 100 years since WWI\u2019s conclusion.\n\nSiriusXM host Rebecca Mansour introduced the segment with the first two stanzas of \u201cIn Flanders Fields,\u201d written by Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae of the Canadian Forces in 1915:\n\nIn Flanders fields the poppies blow\n\nBetween the crosses, row on row,\n\nThat mark our place; and in the sky\n\nThe larks, still bravely singing, fly\n\nScarce heard amid the guns below. We are the Dead. Short days ago\n\nWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,\n\nLoved and were loved, and now we lie\n\nIn Flanders fields.\n\nNaylor said of WWI, \u201cI think that the world came undone during those years, and after more than four years of conflict, it\u2019s as though the world came to its senses. When it was put back together, it wasn\u2019t quite what it was before.\u201d\n\nListen to Naylor\u2019s interview:\n\nNaylor described America\u2019s geopolitical ascendance via WWI, \u201cFor the United States, it was such a profound dramatic transformation, being drawn out from essentially an isolationist country onto the world stage demonstrating its financial power, its economic and industrial might, retreating perhaps a little after the war into its own self for a period, but really set the stage for and birthed the first American century.\u201d\n\nNaylor examined broader impacts of WWI on international affairs, \u201cEmpires done away with, new countries formed, experiments in democracy, enormous development in technologies; we can\u2019t underestimate the impact of World War I in really defining for us the last 100 years, and so it\u2019s right that we should commemorate the founding catastrophe of the 20th century.\u201d\n\nNaylor noted how WWI saw 65 to 70 million service men and women \u2014 primarily men \u2014 mobilized for war, with casualties of more than 30 million. About half of all combatants were killed or wounded. \u201cSeven thousand two hundred deaths a day, 300 an hour, five a minute; for more than four and a half years,\u201d said Naylor. \u201cThe scale of this is just difficult to wrap your head around. So it\u2019s right that we commemorate, that we learn lessons, and that we honor those who served, to acknowledge their courage and the sacrifice that they gave, and to reflect on the risk there is, as it were, of sleepwalking into catastrophe.\u201d\n\nOriginally from Australia, Naylor reflected on WWI\u2019s impact on Australians, \u201cForty percent of all males of service age [in Australia] were shipped off to Europe, of those, a 65 percent casualty rate. There wasn\u2019t a household that wasn\u2019t somehow impacted by WWI.\u201d\n\nNaylor added, \u201cFor Australia, World War I also begins the 100-year defense relationship with the United States, On July 4th, 1918, the Battle of Hamel, American troops served under Australian command \u2026 a 90-minute battle, it was a successful battle and significant in the beginning of the turning of the war, and that began what has been a very successful and important defense relationship. Australia and the United States have fought together in every major war since World War I. July 4th, 1918, marks an important moment for the U.S. and Australia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bathing the memorial in poppies from sunset until the early morning hours for the nine nights leading up to and including November the 11th,\u201d said Naylor of the National World War I Museum and Memorial\u2019s commemoration of WWI\u2019s end. \u201cAt the time of the armistice \u2026 many church bells began to ring in cities. At 11 o\u2019clock on November 11th, on Sunday, many communities will be ringing or tolling bells to commemorate the fallen and remember the armistice, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll also be doing at the National World War I Museum and Memorial. There will be a wreath laying and bell tolling ceremony at 11 o\u2019clock, and we\u2019ll be tolling the bell 21 times.\u201d\n\nNaylor continued, \u201cIn fact, the bell that we\u2019re tolling was rung each day during the U.S. involvement in World War I by the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1917 and 1918, each day, and then in 1926, when President Coolidge came to Kansas City to open the memorial and dedicate it, that bell was rung. The bell was tolled 11 times, its ringing was broadcast by radio together with President Coolidge\u2019s speech, and that very same bell is going to be tolling 21 times at 11 o\u2019clock to honor the Americans. More than 116,000 Americans who lost their lives, approximately 4.7 million Americans who served \u2026 and perhaps as many as 65 million others who were involved as combatants in the war.\u201d\n\nThe National War War I Museum and Memorial will be livestreaming its centennial ceremony via its Facebook page and website beginning at 10:30 a.m. Eastern (9:30 a.m. Central and 7:30 a.m. Pacific).\n\nMilitary historian Patrick O\u2019Donnell, author of The Unknowns: The Untold Story of America\u2019s Unknown Soldier and WWI\u2019s Most Decorated Heroes Who Brought Him Home, also joined Friday\u2019s edition of SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight to examine WWI\u2019s significance.\n\nO\u2019Donnell said, \u201cIf Germany had been allowed to remain a great power in Europe, it would have changed the entire world. It would have changed the trajectory of the United States, for sure. \u2026 I think World War I is the seminal event of the 20th century, and it leads America on a trajectory to lead the American century, too.

This money is being distributed to Gazans under an agreement between Qatar, Israel, and Gaza mediated by Egypt.\n\nQatar supplied the money, taking an increasingly large role in trying to make Gaza more \u201clivable\u201d for the people in the hope of reducing the weekly protests.\n\nMany employees working for Hamas in Gaza have not been paid salaries in months because the money for paying the salaries has not been made available to Hamas. It is not Israel that made the decision to withhold the money. It was the Palestinian Authority (Fatah) headed by Mahmoud Abbas. Abbas is supposed to be the head a unity government of all Palestinians and Abbas has cut off money to pay the salaries of Gazans working for Hamas. Israel has supported Abbas\u2019s decision, out of concern that Hamas would use the salary money to fund terrorist activities.\n\nSo Egypt\u2019s mediation has led to an agreement where Qatar provides the money to pay the salaries of Hamas employees. The $15 million that arrived on Thursday is the first installment of a $90 million total payout. 27,000 civil servants will receive 50 percent of a month\u2019s salary, with the amount to gradually increase over the months.\n\nThe money is not being given to the United Nations or to Hamas. Instead, civil servants\u2019 salaries are being paid individually, under the supervision of the Qataris.\n\nIsrael has not commented on the payments but must have approved them because otherwise the three suitcases of money could not have crossed into Gaza.\n\nHowever, the Palestinian Authority said that the $15 million was \u201ccheap price that Hamas received for the precious blood\u201d of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and that \u201cHamas leaders are prepared to align themselves with the devil in order to remain in power and undermine the Palestinian national project.\u201d Jerusalem Post and Reuters and Jerusalem Post and Middle East Eye and Jerusalem Post\n\nIsrael and Qatar agree to a sea route between Gaza and Cyprus\n\nIsrael and Qatar have reached an agreement on the establishment of a seaport in Cyprus, under Israeli security supervision, that will be used to ship goods to Gaza.\n\nThere is a dispute over how security will be implemented. Israel has demanded that its representatives be present at the seaport for manual inspection of goods entering Gaza to make sure that there are no weapons. However, Hamas is demanding that inspections take place only electronically.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas is completely opposed to the plan, saying Hamas was not authorized to reach any agreement on such matters with international parties and warning that such a move would \u201cconsolidate\u201d the split between the Gaza Strip and West Bank and make Gaza a separate Palestinian state in the Hamas-ruled coastal enclave.\n\nQatar is also working on a number of other proposals to make Gaza more livable, including expanding fishing, establishing industrial zones, and reliable electricity.\n\nIt is hoped that by making Gaza more livable, the weekly \u201cMarch of Return\u201d protests of Gazans trying to break through the fence into Israel and demanding to return to their ancestral homes will be reduced. From the point of view of Generational Dynamics, the protests are being driven by young people just coming of age, and no agreement by their geezer leaders will change that.

A law passed in 2014 and first implemented in 2016, known in elections circles as postmark-plus-three requires that any ballot returned within three days of an election gets counted, so long as the ballot is postmarked by Election Day \u2026 A new law implemented for the first time this year gives voters with a mismatched signature more hope of having their votes counted.

One of the most poignant and meaningful of these ceremonies will take place at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nEvery year, thousands of Americans gather at the tomb in solemn recognition of the tremendous debt we owe to our servicemen and women. There, at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, the annual wreath-laying ceremony will take place on the exact anniversary of the end of World War I.\n\nIt\u2019s a poignant, sacred event that every American should experience at least once in his or her lifetime. But it\u2019s but a faint shadow of the awe-inspiring, intensely meaningful ceremony that took place when the Unknown Soldier was first laid to rest on November 11, 1921.\n\nI retell the story of that Armistice Day and the events leading up to it in my new bestselling book, The Unknowns: The Untold Story of America\u2019s Unknown Soldier and WWI\u2019s Most Decorated Heroes Who Brought Him Home. It follows eight American heroes who accomplished extraordinary feats in some of the war\u2019s most important battles. As a result of their bravery, these eight enlisted men \u2014 Sergeant Samuel Woodfill of the Infantry, Sergeant Harry Taylor of the Cavalry, Sergeant Thomas D. Saunders of the Combat Engineers, Sergeant Louis Razga of the Coast Artillery Corps, Staff Sergeant James W. Dell of the Field Artillery, Chief Torpedoman James Delaney of the US Navy, Chief Water Tender Charles Leo O\u2019Connor of the US Navy and Sergeant Major Ernest A. Janson of the Marine Corps \u2014 were selected to serve as Body Bearers for the Unknown Soldier.\n\nBefore coming home to the United States, the body of the Unknown Soldier had already been through an elaborate selection process, and the French had paid their respects at multiple memorial events where thousands of ordinary French citizens came out to express their gratitude to America\u2019s military.\n\nThe Unknown Soldier arrived home on Wednesday, November 9, 1921, a gray, drizzly day in Washington, D.C. As the USS Olympia slowly slid into her berth, an honor guard waited on the pier. The sailors came to attention on deck as the ship clanged out \u201ceight bells,\u201d the signal for four o\u2019clock, and bugles summoned the crew into formation. At the head of the gangplank, four side boys and a boatswain carrying his pipe stood were ready to recognize the departure of the Unknown Soldier \u2014 their presence an honor usually reserved for full admirals.\n\nThe Navy band on board Olympia played Chopin\u2019s Funeral March and the \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d as the eight Body Bearers slowly carried the flag-draped casket to the waiting gun caisson pulled by six black horses.\n\nA mounted band then took over the musical duties, striking up \u201cOnward, Christian Soldiers\u201d as a regiment of cavalry officers accompanied the Unknown Soldier on its slow, winding journey through the streets to the U.S. Capitol. Along every step of the route, Marines lined the road, standing at attention to honor the Unknown Soldier and all the unknowns who lay buried in Europe.\n\nThe clip-clop of the horses\u2019 hooves on the wet pavement ended abruptly as the procession arrived at the Capital. The cavalrymen wheeled their horses into two lines and drew their sabers, creating a path for the fallen hero.\n\nOnce again, the Body Bearers hoisted the casket to their shoulders and marched it up the granite steps into the Capitol Rotunda. As they entered the majestic building, their footsteps echoed eerily through the dimly lit, nearly empty space. An honor guard took up positions around the casket just moments before the arrival of the first visitors: President Warren Harding and his wife, Florence. The cavalrymen quickly drew their sabers, and the president and first lady passed quietly under the canopy of swords. They laid a ribbon and some flowers on the casket, and a few other dignitaries did the same. Then they left the body to the quiet protection of his honor guard until the next day.,\n\nNovember 10 dawned bright and glorious with not a cloud in the sky. By 8:00 a.m., thousands of ordinary citizens had gathered outside the Capitol, lining up along the rope-draped stanchions to wait their turns to pass by the Unknown Soldier. An all-male choir sang \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d as the first mourners passed by, many of them leaving tokens of respect and remembrance alongside the casket.\n\nThroughout the day, a few civic leaders delivered pre-scheduled speeches, but most of the time was given over to the citizenry who wanted to remember their lost loved ones. Fathers, brothers, sisters, grandparents, and mothers broke down in tears as they mourned for those who had not come home.\n\nThe Capitol police estimated that between ninety thousand and ninety-six thousand paid their respects to the Unknown Soldier that day\u2014the piles of flowers around the casket growing ever higher until the scent of the blossoms became nearly overpowering. It was almost midnight before the last mourner passed though the great hall under the dome, yet outside remained people who had to be turned away. The Associated Press report painted the scene as the day of mourning came to a close:\n\nThe lights in the vaulted chamber dwindled and died to a dim glow, the great bronze doors swung shut, and, alone again with the tireless comrades who kept the last vigil with him, America\u2019s Unknown from France was left to await dawn and the coming of the cortege in which the President and all the highest figures in American national life will walk humbly to carry him to the grave.\n\nFriday, November 11, began with a thundering boom as soldiers fired the big guns at Fort Myer. At 8:00 a.m., an army band began to play, and the Body Bearers slowly carried the coffin down the steps to the black-draped caisson drawn by six black horses.\n\nA grand cort\u00e8ge marched through the streets of Washington. Several officers led the way on horseback, followed by an Army band and drum corps, an infantry regiment, a field artillery battalion, a troop of cavalry, and four chaplains. Then came the horse-drawn caisson bearing the Unknown Soldier.\n\nIn a place of honor behind the casket walked President Harding and General John Pershing, who had led the American Expeditionary Forces in France. Other dignitaries followed on foot, and former president Wilson, who was unable to walk following a stroke, rode in an old-fashioned carriage. Then came another drum corps followed by some of America\u2019s most heroic warriors: the soldiers who had received the Medal of Honor. Other veterans trailed behind them, along with nurses and some representatives of various civic organizations. Last, and most sorrowful of all, came a phalanx of Gold Star Mothers, the women who had lost sons in battle.\n\nTens of thousands of people lined the streets, many of them alternately waving small flags and wiping away tears. The procession dwindled somewhat as some could not make the entire five-mile journey on foot, but eventually the cavalcade reached Arlington.\n\nThe United States Marine Band played a slow dirge as the body of the Unknown Soldier approached the amphitheater where the funeral would be held. Once again, Woodfill, Taylor, Razga, Saunders, Dell, Delaney, Janson, and O\u2019Connor gently lifted the casket of the Unknown Soldier above their shoulders. Step by step they carried him through the high-pillared colonnade. At the front, they laid the Unknown reverently upon a high platform engulfed by flowers.\n\nMusic, prayers, and brief speeches followed. Just before noon, church bells rang across the city \u2014 and echoed across the country \u2014 as the entire nation observed two minutes of silence.\n\nPresident Harding addressed both those gathered at the amphitheater and Americans listening in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. Technology similar to the telephone service transmitted his voice by wire to amplifiers in designated gathering places in those cities, where people gathered to hear their president speak. He waxed eloquent for several minutes before concluding, \u201cAs we return this poor clay to its mother soil, garlanded by love and covered with the decorations that only nations can bestow, I can sense the prayers of our people, of all peoples, that this Armistice Day shall mark the beginning of a new and lasting era of peace on earth, goodwill among men.\u201d Then he led the entire nation in the Lord\u2019s Prayer before pinning the Distinguished Service Cross and the Medal of Honor to the casket.\n\nPatrick K.

The neurosurgeon said his brain was bleeding, but radiologists said there was evidence of a tumor.\n\nWood, who considers himself a man of faith, turned to his community for support. But what he did not expect was the overwhelming amount of prayer and support for him on social media.\n\n\u201cMy phone is blowing up, my Facebook is prayer after prayer, all over California,\u201d said Wood.\n\nWhen doctors took another brain scan the day before his operation, they canceled the surgery because the tumor had disappeared.\n\nWood said it was nothing short of a \u201cmiracle\u201d from God.\n\nIt\u2019s a miracle and that is the way God planned it,\u201d he said.\n\nWood\u2019s doctor struggled to explain why the tumor disappeared, admitting that there are some things \u201cthat we can\u2019t explain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do tests and we have medical technology and we try to come up with some conclusion\u2026 sometimes things happen that we can\u2019t explain,\u201d said Dr. Richard Yee.\n\nBut faith leaders at Wood\u2019s place of worship, Gravity Church, say a higher power was at work when Wood received the outpouring of prayers from his community.\n\n\u201cHe just kept saying, \u2018no matter what happens to me, I\u2019m going to be okay. I trust God.\u2019 And that was an inspiration for a lot of people around him,\u201d said Jason McEachron, a Pastor at Gravity Church.\n\nAlthough the doctors are unsure of what contributed to Wood\u2019s recovery, they were so fascinated by it that they asked him to take part in a research study.", "Georgia Republican Brian Kemp\u2019s campaign on Saturday lambasted Democrat rival Stacey Abrams over her refusal to concede in the state\u2019s gubernatorial race.\n\n\u201cStacey Abrams\u2019 antics are a disgrace to democracy and completely ignore the will of the people,\u201d campaign communications director Ryan Mahoney said in a statement. \u201cGeorgia voters have spoken.

While there were some notes of harmony, there was a lot more discord.\n\nThe U.S. side began with Pompeo listing areas of potential cooperation. He said North Korea was an area of cooperation where China could help achieve \u201cmeaningful breakthroughs.\u201d\n\nHe also said he hoped to see cooperation from China in addressing Iran\u2019s nuclear missile programs and other malign activities. \u201cBringing Iran\u2019s oil export revenues to zero is a critical component of this campaign, and we discussed this today,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the \u201csignificant differences\u201d included China\u2019s emplacement of military weapons on islands and other land features in the South China Sea that are also claimed by multiple other East Asian nations, China\u2019s attempts to strip away Taiwan\u2019s diplomatic allies, and its repression of religious minorities.\n\nDespite those differences, Pompeo said the U.S. is \u201cnot pursuing a cold war or containment policy with China. \u201cRather, we want to ensure that China acts responsibly and fairly in support of security and prosperity of each of our two countries,\u201d he said.\n\nPompeo and Mattis meet with their Chinese counterparts at the State Department.

He also suggested that the U.S. was militarizing the region by conducting freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea.\n\n\u201cWe believe that no country should use any excuse to engage in militarization in the region,\u201d Yang said. \u201cActually, to pursue militarization in the region will not only undermine interests of regional countries, but will hurt the countries who take these actions themselves.\u201d\n\nIn a not-so-veiled barb to U.S. leaders who say the U.S. is \u201ca Pacific nation,\u201d Yang said, \u201cWe respect the United States\u2019 interest in the Asia-Pacific. At the same time, we expect the United States to respect China\u2019s security interests in the Asia-Pacific, China\u2019s sovereignty and development interests.\u201d\n\nOn the Iran nuclear deal, Yang said it needed to be \u201cimplemented and observed.\u201d He reaffirmed China\u2019s commitment to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and said China would continue to \u201cenforce strictly\u201d relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. He said both sides exchanged views on Afghanistan and other regional and international issues, and agreed to \u201cstep up communication and coordination and play a positive role in seeking proper settlement to relevant issues.\u201d\n\nMattis reiterated the U.S. stance that all parties adhere to international law when it comes to territorial disputes in the South China Sea. However, he noted that the U.S.-China military relationship could serve as a source of stability between the nations. His counterpart, Minister of National Defense of the People\u2019s Republic of China General Wei Fenghe echoed those remarks.\n\nThe Chinese tone became more pointed, however, during the question and answer session with journalists, who honed in on areas of disagreement.\n\nYang, the Chinese foreign minister, said he \u201cmade it clear\u201d to the U.S. that it should stop sending ships and aircraft close to \u201cChinese islands\u201d in the South China Sea. He also said Taiwan is an \u201cinalienable part of the Chinese territory.\u201d In regards to Chinese treatment of religious minorities, he said, \u201cForeign countries have no right to interfere.\u201d He said he hoped the U.S. would \u201cstop interfering in China\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d\n\nWei, the defense minister said Taiwan is an \u201cinseparable\u201d part of China, and if China\u2019s territorial integrity is under threat, it would reunify Taiwan \u201cat any cost, just like what the U.S. side had in Civil War.\u201d\n\nMattis remained mostly straight-faced and expressionless throughout the conference. Pompeo yielded a tight-lipped smile while listening to his counterpart at times.\n\nFriday\u2019s meeting was the second time the leaders of the State and Defense Departments met with their Chinese counterparts for the U.S.-China Diplomatic and Security Dialogue, put into place by President Trump last year.\n\nIn response to a question from Chinese state media, Yang said he hoped the issues in U.S.-China economic and trade relations could be resolved through dialogue and consultation, and that a trade war would only \u201cend up hurting both sides and the global economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI, for one, believe that our friendship has sunken deep within the hearts of our two peoples, and will grow into a big tree with big foliage. The further development of China-U.S. relations will, for sure, give our two peoples a greater sense of gain and satisfaction,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, across town at a think-tank, the tone from Trump\u2019s top trade adviser was notably sharper.\n\nPeter Navarro, speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, blasted China for its aggressive trade practices with the U.S. that hurt American businesses and workers.\n\nHe said during a round of negotiations earlier this year, he and other advisers went to Beijing to negotiate with the Chinese. He said they put down a long list of demands. The Chinese refused to acknowledge U.S. concerns.\n\n\u201cWhat do we hear? \u2018We don\u2019t engage in cyber theft, we are the biggest victim of cyber theft, we don\u2019t force technology transfers.\u2019 How do you have a deal with somebody if they won\u2019t even acknowledge your concerns? It is Alice in Wonderland,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also accused China of trying to continue talking to the U.S. and delay any reforms. \u201cThat\u2019s all they want to do. They want to get us to the bargaining table, sound reasonable, and talk their way while they keep having their way with us.\u201d\n\nHe also poured cold water on reaching a trade deal when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping meet in Buenos Aires, Argentina, later this month for the G-20 meeting. He slammed a \u201cself-appointed group of Wall Street bankers and hedge fund managers\u201d shuttling back and forth between Beijing in hopes of pressuring the White House to end the trade war with China.\n\n\u201cWhen these unpaid foreign agents engage in this kind of diplomacy \u2014 so-called diplomacy \u2014 all they do is weaken this president and his negotiating position. No good can come of this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf and when there is a deal, it will be on President Donald Trump\u2019s terms, not Wall Street\u2019s terms,\u201d he said.", "Two organizations financed by billionaire liberal activist George Soros have threatened to take Florida Gov.

Otherwise, the Constitution could deprive the nation of a functioning government every time a new party wins the presidency if the opposition party controls the Senate at the same time.\n\nSome of those attacking Whitaker\u2019s appointment at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) are left-wing partisans who hate President Trump and will say anything to embarrass him, but others are conservative lawyers who are making arguments in good faith, even if they are wrong.\n\nIt is always good to have lawyers argue both sides of an issue. With all the legal arguments being pressed about how Whitaker\u2019s appointment is illegal, it seems only fair to offer constitutional arguments in support of his appointment.\n\nThe Appointments Clause of Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution provides that the president \u201cshall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall Appoint \u2026 [Principal] Officers of the United States.\u201d\n\nOften that means that when a top government position \u2013 called a \u201cprincipal officer\u201d \u2013 becomes vacant, it remains unfilled until the president nominates someone and then the U.S. Senate has time to vet, hold committee hearings, have floor debate, and confirm the nominee. The Constitution should allow for some degree of \u201cplay in the joints\u201d to handle such situations.\n\nCongress\u2019s answer was the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA), which provides several routes for someone to fulfill the duties of these important positions while the nomination and confirmation process plays out. First, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3345(a)(1) allows the \u201cfirst assistant\u201d to a Senate-confirmed officer to serve as the acting officer on a temporary basis. Additionally, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3345(a)(2) allows the president to name a person who has served in that department for at least 90 days at a pay level of GS-15 or higher \u2013 essentially a top-level career civil servant or non-Senate political appointee \u2013 to likewise serve as the acting officer.\n\nEither way, that acting officer can serve for 210 days (seven months), and that time is extended if the president has nominated a permanent replacement but the Senate has not yet voted on the nominee.\n\nWhitaker was the highest-ranking person at DOJ who was not Senate-confirmed, as chief of staff to the attorney general. He is a \u201cSchedule C\u201d political appointee, meaning that he was appointed by the Senate-confirmed head of DOJ, the attorney general. He is at the top pay level in the department (above GS-15), and has held that position for more than 90 days. President Trump invoked his authority under 5 U.S.C. \u00a73345(a)(2) to name Whitaker as acting attorney general until the president can nominate, and the Senate can confirm, a new attorney general.\n\nLegal critics argue that the Constitution requires Senate confirmation as a check on the president\u2019s power, ensuring that no president can flood the zone with legions of unqualified loyalists who would never be approved by the Senate. They argue that FVRA provides an end-run around that check, and thus that those provisions are unconstitutional.\n\nTheir argument sweeps more broadly than they might realize. If correct, their argument does more than nix the president\u2019s ability to name someone. It also would mean that the provision allows a \u201cfirst assistant,\u201d who is most often a non-Senate officer, to take over.\n\nFor example, all 93 U.S. attorneys are Senate-confirmed political appointees. When a new president takes over and cleans house, a senior federal prosecutor in that office makes all the decisions, and signs all the legal briefs and court filings, as the acting U.S. attorney.\n\nBut under the rule proposed by Whitaker\u2019s critics, all that is unconstitutional. All federal prosecutions must stop until the Senate gets around to confirming a new U.S. attorney in each office. That does not sound right.\n\nThese critics are perhaps forgetting Article II, Section 1, Clause 1 of the Constitution, the Executive Vesting Clause, which establishes the bedrock principle of a \u201cunitary executive\u201d with the words, \u201cThe executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nBut a president is only one human being, with a body that can work only so many hours a day, requires sleep, food, and bathroom breaks. For at least eight hours a day, he cannot run the government directly. He has only two ears and one mouth, so cannot participate in both a military briefing and an economic briefing simultaneously. He only has two hands, and so cannot sign two orders at literally the same moment. He cannot have private meetings with the president of China and the prime minister of the United Kingdom at the same time.\n\nIn short, every president needs subordinates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for the government of the world\u2019s lone superpower to function. The president therefore must have power to install subordinates who will carry out his wishes.\n\nAny other conclusion would lead to the absurd choice of either crippling the entire U.S. government \u2013 including national security functions \u2013 until the Senate goes through the entire confirmation process, or persuading leaders of the opposing political party to stay in their powerful positions for weeks or months until replacements can be both nominated and confirmed.\n\nWho else could run the government before top officials are confirmed? White House staff do not require Senate confirmation, so if the critics\u2019 arguments were correct, these staffers cannot run the departments, either.\n\nEven if that argument were not on the table, it would be a far greater threat to the concept of checking a president\u2019s power through Senate approval to allow his handpicked personal advisers, who are often the most loyal to the president and often accused of more partisan behavior, to assume operational control of every aspect of the government.\n\nQuite the contrary, so much power radiates out of the Oval Office that good government counsels that the president\u2019s intimate advisers be a separate group of people from those managing government operations. You want the national security advisor to never have a self-serving reason to let the president know if the State Department or Defense Department is failing to implement the president\u2019s agenda, which the national security advisor is less likely to do if he actually commands those departments. You want the national economic adviser to provide candid and critical feedback to the president regarding the Treasury Department. You want the domestic policy adviser never to have a reason to trim his sails when providing critical feedback on the Department of Health and Human Services. The list goes on.\n\nThus, the unavoidable result of the argument against Whitaker\u2019s appointment is that when a new party takes the White House, the new president has no choice but retain in critical Cabinet positions top partisans from the defeated party. Although department heads serve at the pleasure of the president, henceforth no president could fire any of those top government officers until their replacements are confirmed \u2013 a process that can take weeks or months \u2013 even if those Cabinet officers blatantly and deliberately disobey the president\u2019s orders. The new president would have executive authority in name only.\n\nPut this in concrete terms. Imagine a Republican president like Donald Trump follows a Democrat president like Barack Obama. Imagine also that a hardline partisan Democrat like Chuck Schumer holds a majority in the Senate. President Trump is sworn in, but Schumer says he likes Obama\u2019s current Cabinet better, and thus the Senate will go a full year without allowing a confirmation vote on a single Trump nominee for a Cabinet post.\n\nSchumer goes on to say, \u201cFor that matter, I will not confirm a single nomination to any lower-ranking position in the entire government for the next 365 days, either.\u201d No deputy secretaries, no under secretaries, no assistant secretaries, no ambassadors, no U.S. attorneys, etc.\n\nPresident Trump orders Secretary of State John Kerry to withdraw the United States from the Iran deal, but Kerry responds, \u201cNo chance!\u201d President Trump orders Attorney General Loretta Lynch to defend his new immigration policy to restrict entry in this country of persons from terror-prone nations like Syria or Iran, but Lynch responds, \u201cI will actually file briefs saying that the Justice Department thinks your policy should be struck down, and by the way, the whole department will shut down if you fire me, Mr. President!\u201d Of course, the legal defense might be a moot point, because Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson fell out of his chair laughing when he read President Trump\u2019s new immigration policy and sent the president an email explaining that Johnson will now be making his own policies, because he just heard Schumer\u2019s comments on television, and the secretary consequently knows that as a practical matter he cannot be fired for the next year. He will come by the White House to let his boss, the president, know which issues Johnson might be willing to negotiate over.\n\nThen these Obama department heads agree that they will not use their statutory authority to appoint any of the lower-ranking Schedule C political appointments whom the White House wants, because federal law specifies that the heads of agencies technically make those decisions, rather than the president directly. Kerry\u2019s chief of staff is ready to resign, but instead of the person put forward by the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, Kerry exercises his authority to grant that Schedule C appointment to someone who tweets about how much he despises both President Trump and the nation of Israel.\n\nLynch does the same thing at the Department of Justice. Instead of Matt Whitaker \u2013 whom the White House wants \u2013 Lynch uses her authority as attorney general to appoint a chief of staff who believes in amnesty for illegal aliens, that religious liberty protects only the right to worship in your home or church, that sex-discrimination laws cover sexual orientation and gender identity, that the Second Amendment does not apply to private citizens, and that President Trump should be impeached.\n\nAdding insult to injury, the entire Obama Cabinet blows off President Trump\u2019s Cabinet meeting in the White House, flying instead to Chappaqua resemble presidential orders, and they promise to fly back to Washington and put those policies into effect.\n\nEssentially, Clinton is the de facto president until Schumer decides to allow confirmation votes for Trump nominees.\n\nThis scenario sounds absurd, but would legally be entirely possible if the argument were true that only a current Senate-confirmed officer can temporarily assume the duties of another Senate-confirmed position, even temporarily, up to and including a Cabinet-level department head like the attorney general.\n\nIn other words, these critics\u2019 argument appears to set Article II\u2019s Appointments Clause on a head-on collision with Article II\u2019s Executive Vesting Clause.\n\nNone of this means that the precise terms of FVRA are the best combination of policy specifics to fill that need for play in the joints when transitioning government power and personnel. Perhaps the temporary appointment should be limited to 180 days, instead of 210. Maybe it should authorize someone who has held the relevant previous job at least 120 days, instead of 90. Whitaker\u2019s appointment satisfies any of those minor tweaks in the specific requirements.\n\nBut viewing the big picture, some mechanism to temporarily fill top government positions is necessary for a new president to take over. That being the case, there is nothing in the Constitution\u2019s text, structure, or history indicating that transitional authority expires after a period of time. But even if it did, such a limitation would not apply here, because there are still dozens of Senate-confirmed key administration positions for which President Trump has made a nomination, but the Senate has not acted since the president took office. Take for example Charles Stimson, the nominee for general counsel of the U.S. Navy, whose nomination has been pending since 2017.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Robert Jackson once wrote that the Constitution is not a \u201csuicide pact.\u201d That is true politically as well. While the Constitution does divide power, and includes checks and balances, it does not do so in a way that ensures that a new president could be utterly paralyzed if the other party controls the Senate.\n\nIt is hard to see how the arguments against any president having the ability to fill vacancies of top government positions could lead to any other result.\n\nKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.
