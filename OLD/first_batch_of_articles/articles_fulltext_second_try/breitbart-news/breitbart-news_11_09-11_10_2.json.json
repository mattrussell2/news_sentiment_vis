They thought that it meant a political position and they were opposed,\u201d Lisante said.\n\nA few vandals allegedly defaced the mural with splotches of red paint on Monday night, several days before the mural\u2019s scheduled completion.\n\nLisante proposed the mural several weeks ago but received mixed messages from the community. A few community members opposed the mural, calling the flag \u201ca symbol of hate and oppression,\u201d while others rallied in support of the mural.\n\nSome residents created a GoFundMe page with a goal of $8,000 to raise money for the project, while Lisante\u2019s friend, Army National Guard veteran and New York state corrections officer Joey Garcia, organized an \u201cAmerican flag appreciation walk\u201d on October 21 to rally support for the mural.\n\nBut not everyone was happy with the community\u2019s overwhelming support for the American flag. A handful of Antifa protesters showed up to the appreciation walk, holding signs that read, \u201cYes, I\u2019m anti-AmeriKKKan\u201d and \u201cStop Pretending your Racism is Patriotism.\u201d\n\nDespite the vandalism, the community members behind the GoFundMe page responded in kind.\n\nThe GoFundMe page increased its fundraising goal from $8,000 to $12,000 in light of the vandalism, exceeding its $12,000 goal as of Saturday evening.\n\nLisante said the funds would go towards funding \u201cpaint, materials, future maintenance, and display lighting to increase visibility\u201d for the pizzeria\u2019s mural.\n\nPolice say they are actively investigating the incident.", "The U.S. Army is about to acquire an advanced camouflage defense system, designed to protect troops from a variety of threats in multiple combat environments.\n\nThe Army recently selected a company that will design an Ultra-Light Camouflage Netting System (ULCANS), a system designed to protect troops and equipment from visible threats and threats that the eye cannot see by using a camouflage screen to block radars across the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThe company selected for the $480 million contract, Fibrotex USA, will spend the next ten years developing and producing the camouflage netting system for our nation\u2019s armed forces.\n\nThe netting is available in dark and light shades and can withstand multiple combat conditions.\n\n\u201cToday more than ever, military forces and opposition groups are using night vision sensors and thermal devices against our troops, but by using Fibrotex\u2019s camouflage, concealment and deception solutions, we make them undetectable again, allowing them to continue keeping us safe,\u201d Eyal Malleron, CEO of Fibrotex USA, told the Army Times.\n\nFibrotex is expected to begin production of the ULCANS system in early 2019 out of a Kentucky facility. The move is expected to bring hundreds of jobs to the area.\n\nThe company also has a contract with the Finnish Army to develop a similar camouflage system, but that contract is set to expire at the end of 2018.", "Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson joined Breitbart News Saturday to discuss his recent tour of the New England Center and Home for Veterans in Boston.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really fantastic being able to work for an agency that spends so much of its time and effort focused on veterans,\u201d Secretary Carson told Breitbart News Deputy Political Editor Amanda House. \u201cLess than one percent of our population protects the other 99 percent. It allows us to be able to live in peace and safety.\u201d\n\nCarson spoke about his experience speaking with the veterans.\n\n\u201cI had heard that the center in Boston was doing a particularly good job of getting the veterans who, in many cases, are chronically homeless, off the streets. I wanted to go for myself and see what they were doing, actually talk to some of the veterans,\u201d Carson said. \u201cIt was so wonderful actually talking to some of them.\u201d\n\nSecretary Carson then discussed the progress being made to assist homeless veterans.\n\n\u201cOver the last year, we do a point-in-time assessment every January. We\u2019ve gone down more than five percent in veteran homelessness across the country,\u201d Secretary Carson stated. \u201cSo we\u2019re making tremendous progress. It\u2019s the kind of feel-good thing that should make us all feel great, regardless of what party affiliation one has.\u201d\n\nListen to Ben Carson on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125:\n\nSecretary Carson commented on many of the veterans he met and spoke with during his visit.\n\n\u201cI gave all of the veterans that I talked to an opportunity to complain. They had nothing to complain about. They had a chance to see their case managers on a regular basis. There were people there to take care of all of their basic needs. There were even training programs for those who are capable and interested in retraining for employment and many people have gone on to be quite independent.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur people are resources. We have to develop them, not warehouse them,\u201d Carson explained.\n\nCarson then spoke on the state of care for veterans nationwide and his thoughts on the issue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had an opportunity to go to a number of places where they are serving the veterans extremely well. It\u2019s really just a matter of disseminating the best practices to all of these places. There seems to be a lot of interest, a lot of people who really have big hearts, who recognize the tremendous service and sacrifice that these people have given up.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur country is full of good-hearted people. It\u2019s not the people that you see on the on the 6:30 news running around trying to hurt everybody. That\u2019s not what most Americans are like, and it\u2019s wonderful when they have an opportunity to demonstrate that compassion.\u201d\n\nSixty-four local communities and three states have declared an effective end of veteran homelessness. Secretary Carson spoke on this and offered insight as to how those results were calculated.\n\n\u201cWhen we have 95 percent of veterans off the streets, that\u2019s considered essential victory,\u201d said Carson. \u201cYou\u2019re always gonna have two or three people say, \u2018No, no, no, I don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t want any part of what you guys are doing. I like it out here on the streets.\u2019 You\u2019re always going to have people like that, although we continue to work on those individuals and try to help them too. Many of the people I\u2019ve talked to were like that at one point, but their confidence was gained and they\u2019re very happy that that has happened.\u201d\n\nCarson concluded the interview by directing listeners intersted in assiting with HUD\u2019s mission to visit hud.gov.", "Victoria\u2019s Secret chief marketing officer Ed Razek apologized on Saturday for comments he made about not casting transgender contestants in the company\u2019s famed fashion shows.\n\nIn an interview with Vogue, Razek said that such a move would spoil the \u201cfantasy\u201d of the performance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, why doesn\u2019t your show do this?

The gang is believed to be responsible for much of the recent cartel bloodshed in the border city of Ciudad Juarez.\n\nWednesday\u2019s operation resulted in the capture of Santana Garza, \u201cEl 300.\u201d The raid took place in the municipality of Aldama, which sits just outside of the state capital of Chihuahua. Officials announced his arrest at a press conference held by Manelich Castilla Craviotto, the chief of the Mexican Federal Police. Santana Garza, 34-years-old, is one of the leaders of \u201cLos Aztecas\u201d gang. Chief Craviotto said the gang is considered to be one of the most violent criminal cells within La Linea, the armed wing of the Nuevo Cartel de Juarez. Authorities linked Santana Garza directly to numerous attacks on police officers, including some earlier this month and another resulting in the death of ministerial police officer Mariano Contreras Rivera which occurred on September 6, 2018, as reported by Breitbart Texas.\n\nSantana Garza was previously arrested for possession of a quantity of cocaine and a loaded handgun while driving in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. He was only charged with drug possession and not murder and was subsequently released by a judge after paying a bond, promising to appear back in court.

The county\u2019s canvassing board declared most of those provisional ballots invalid because the voters either registered to vote after the deadline, voted at the wrong precinct, or voted multiple times.\n\nPat Nesbit, Broward County\u2019s Election Day operations manager, said elections workers set aside the 205 ballots because of a connectivity problem with the system used to confirm voter registration status.\n\nThese 205 voters swiped their IDs into the system, but the system showed they were not registered to vote. But staffers who called the Broward County elections headquarters found those voter registrations appeared in the system.\n\nPoll workers then instructed those 205 voters to cast provisional ballots.\n\nStaffers removed the 205 provisional ballots from signed envelopes and placed them in a voting machine. The machine did not add those ballots to the final vote count.\n\nSnipes and the elections department initially intended to take care of the ballots administratively, causing an outcry from Florida Republican Party attorneys.

We are reviewing all legal options at this time and will continue to protect the rights of every legal voter in Arizona.\u201d\n\nFontes defended Celis-Acosta during the 2011 Fast and Furious-related trial, dismissing his actions as that of a kid and not nefarious. That same year, he defended Emilia Palomina-Robles, who was charged for participation in attempting to \u201cpurchase a Stinger missile and other military weapons for a Mexican drug cartel,\u201d according to the report.

It\u2019s clear. He fired the guy that recused himself from the probe to put in someone who has already prejudged the investigation. \u2026 And so, we have a number of options.

They run government, of course. They have the House. They have the Senate. They have the White House. But they can\u2019t sort out themselves, so they\u2019ve had to rely on Democratic votes.

Wednesday, with the Democrats\u2019 election triumph not a day old, Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, setting off a potential constitutional crisis. He named DoJ Chief of Staff Matt Whitaker as acting attorney general, who has a long history of hostile statements toward Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation \u2014 including advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller probe. Now, more than ever, a functioning democracy requires Democrats and Republicans to come together to take action \u2014 next week \u2014 to protect Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation. If we don\u2019t, and Donald Trump is given license to shut down an investigation into his own potential wrongdoing, then our nation starts to devolve into a banana republic.\n\nThis is a serious issue, but we won\u2019t let it completely distract from what did happen on Tuesday. On Election Day, voters across the country braved the cold, the rain, and hours-long lines for the chance to fulfill their civic duty. I visited my first polling place of the day in New Haven at 6AM and went town to town all day. I saw a passion and excitement for voting that I haven\u2019t seen in a long time.\n\nIt was a good night for progress \u2014 and for the checks and balances the founders wrote into the Constitution. Democrats won back the House of Representatives, made historic gains in governor\u2019s races, and state legislatures across the country. And held our own in the Senate, battling the toughest map we\u2019d ever seen. We\u2019ve heard for eight years that undemocratic gerrymandering meant it would be impossible for Democrats to retake the House majority before redistricting \u2014 that was once conventional wisdom, but the voters weren\u2019t listening.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole industry of cable news pundits and political spin doctors who will all have their own explanations for what happened. I\u2019m here to tell you to tune out all the noise, take a step back from refreshing Twitter, and focus on what actually matters.\n\nOn the ground, out here in America, this election was about, more than anything else, health care.\n\nWashington Republicans spent all of 2017 trying to rip up protections for patients that were put in place under the Affordable Care Act. But even though they had control of the White House, Senate, and House for 24 months, they couldn\u2019t do it. Why? Because to people out here in America, the politics don\u2019t matter. The Affordable Care Act helped them, and the people rose up and stopped repeal. I\u2019d never seen anything like it.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t mean the Republican attacks on our health care stopped \u2014 far from it. Donald Trump has systematically sabotaged the underpinnings of the American health care system, jacking up costs and gutting benefits for people when they get sick. Republicans are still coming after your health care through executive orders, perverse new rules coming out of the Department of Health & Human Services, and piles of lawsuits in hopes the Court will do what Congress couldn\u2019t.\n\nAnd all that set the stage for last Tuesday. People are pissed that Republicans care so much about taking away their health care. Let\u2019s face it, there are some things so fundamental to daily life that they transcend politics and partisanship. Health care is one of those things. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a conservative or liberal, doesn\u2019t matter whether you voted for Trump or Clinton. You want health insurance that covers what you need it to cover, will be there for you in an emergency, and doesn\u2019t cost more than you can afford. It\u2019s simple.\n\nHow policies affect real people\u2019s lives may be secondary to the political horse race that the pundits obsess over, but this Tuesday showed that voters care. They saw gleeful Republicans partying in the Rose Garden after advancing a bill that would gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions and jack up premiums for working families. Democrats won all across the country on Tuesday because voters saw the president and Republicans coming after their health care and they said \u2018hell no.\u2019\n\nI heard the same thing at polling places on Tuesday, when I walked across Connecticut this summer \u2014 health care was the most important issue. Exit polls showed that health care was the #1 issue, and it wasn\u2019t even close.\n\nThanks to victories across the country, Democrats in Congress will be in a better position to stand up for your kids, your parents, your neighbors, your friends. Congressional Republicans have a choice to make: continue down their path of sabotage or work with us to lower health care costs and expand access to quality care. If they continue to sabotage your health care, we\u2019ll stand up against Republican efforts to hand control of your health care over to the insurers that see a sick person as a liability, not a patient who can get better with the right care. We\u2019ll do everything we can to make sure pre-existing condition protections are here to stay we will try to use our new power to take the next steps, like taking on the drug monopolies and forcing down the exorbitant costs of the prescriptions that still threaten to bankrupt many Americans and the U.S. treasury.\n\nBut the success of our health care system isn\u2019t just up to us. You have a role to play. Right now.\n\nOpen enrollment for health insurance is here! If you are uninsured or you don\u2019t get your insurance through your employer, go to Healthcare.gov \u2014 today \u2014 to shop around and pick the health insurance plan that fits the needs and budget of you and your family. Do your research \u2014 just be sure to pick a plan by deadline of December 15th.\n\nEverything that I, my colleagues in the Senate, and the new Democratic House majority do to defend patient protections will be meaningless if you don\u2019t go out and make sure you have health insurance. Do it. It\u2019s easy, and it\u2019s the single best thing you can do to protect you and your loved ones for 2019.\n\nOh, and one last thing. We get to take to the streets to protect the Mueller investigation, and have these arguments about the future of American health care, because we live in a democracy, where everyone gets a say. And so remember that this Sunday, Veterans Day. Tuesday\u2019s vote represented a dramatic shift in power, in Washington and all across the country. But remember that millions of people across the world never get to vote in an election. Thank a veteran this weekend, because they made sure that we can.\u201d", "Democrat Kyrsten Sinema retained a tight lead over Republican opponent Martha McSally in Arizona\u2019s midterm election race to replace Jeff Flake in the U.S. Senate as of late Friday.\n\nMaricopa County, Arizona\u2019s far-and-away highest volume voting county, announced it had completed counting ballots Friday.

Several county Republican parties have filed a lawsuit against county recorders and the Secretary of State over the practice of calling voters after the election to verify signatures on mail ballots dropped at polling locations on election day.\n\nThe only counties with ballots left to be counted as of Saturday were Pima, Pinal, and Yuma Counties. Sinema led in Pima at the time, while McSally led in Pinal and Yuma. Pima had a much higher volume of votes compared to Pinal and Yuma as of Saturday. Each county had counted between 97.73 and 99.20 percent of their precincts reporting.\n\nSinema has thus far garnered 49.34 percent of the vote with 991,433 ballots cast in her favor.

The migrants exploited weaknesses in older technology to cross over and burrow under the existing barrier.\n\nDuring a two-day period beginning on November 6, agents assigned to the Yuma Station apprehended large groups of migrants who illegally crossed the border east of the San Luis Port of Entry. The nearly 45o migrants who mostly travelled to the U.S. from Central America ranged in age from two-years-old to 48, according to information provided to Breitbart News by Yuma Sector Border Patrol officials.\n\nA Yuma Station camera operator observed a large group of 82 illegal aliens crossing from Mexico into the U.S. by climbing over the legacy \u201clanding mat border wall\u201d east of the San Luis Port of Entry, officials stated. The operator dispatched agents to respond to the area. When they arrived, the group surrendered to the agents. During an immigration interview, the agents learned the migrants were mostly family units from Guatemala (79) and El Salvador (3) ranging in age from two to 48-years-old.\n\nA few hours later, operators detected another large group of migrants (83) digging a small hole under the barrier in the same area. Video surveillance provided to Breitbart News by Yuma Sector officials shows the group coming through the hole and a Border Patrol vehicle quickly arriving on scene to take the migrants into custody. The second group also consisted mostly of family units from Guatemalans (69) and El Salvador (14). They ranged in age from two to 40-years-old, officials reported.\n\nYuma Sector officials said the old-style \u201clanding mat\u201d wall design lacks the improved concrete footer found in the new wall prototypes tested in the San Diego Sector earlier this year. This older style technology allows migrants to burrow under the fence.\n\nBorder Patrol officials reported that by the end of the day on Wednesday, agents apprehended 449 illegal aliens.

No politician had devoted as much time to documenting the corrosive effects of low-skilled mass immigration on the country\u2019s working class. Sessions was a nationalist long before Trump came on the scene. He knew the myriad tactics through which the nation\u2019s career bureaucrats and immigration advocates had abetted mass illegal entry, and set out to block them. As attorney general, he used every lawful tool available to his office to fight the sanctuary-city movement, whereby local jurisdictions openly defy the federal government\u2019s efforts to protect the public from illegal-alien criminals. Scofflaw cities and states across the country responded with a spate of lawsuits against Sessions; left-wing judges slapped the Justice Department with questionable nationwide injunctions to protect the sanctuary jurisdictions. Sessions sued right back. Sheriffs, the closest to the ground when it comes to public sentiment about law enforcement, understood what was at stake. \u201cJeff Sessions has probably been the most effective attorney general in the eyes of law enforcement in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d National Sheriffs\u2019 Association executive director Jonathan Thompson told the Huffington Post in August 2018.\n\nThe open-borders immigration bar had turned the asylum process into a mechanism for gaining immediate entry into the country, followed by immediate disappearance into the hinterland and absorption into the mass of untold millions of illegal immigrants. The Obama administration had declared domestic violence a ground for asylum, even though asylum is a response to state oppression. Sessions restored its original meaning. He declared an end to catch-and-release at the border, instead ordering the detention of all illegal crossers until they could be processed for deportation. That new zero-tolerance policy for illegal entry triggered the \u201cchild separation\u201d PR debacle this summer. But even the Obama administration had railed against the politicized court rulings that led to the media-created \u201cemergency\u201d of child separations.

He insisted I try a slice of his almond cake.

They led cavalry charges, carried supplies to the front, and died by the millions during World War I.\n\nHorses, mules, dogs, pigeons, even a baboon, all were a vital \u2013 and for decades overlooked \u2013 part of the Allied war machine.\n\nResearchers have been hard-pressed to find official accounts of the services rendered by animals. Today, they are emerging as unsung heroes of the Great War. France recently decided to recognize their role in war. And in 2004, Britain installed a huge memorial to the vital contributions of animals on the edge of London\u2019s Hyde Park.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how four-legged and winged warriors contributed.\n\n___\n\nWHAT THEY DID\n\nAn estimated 10 million horses and mules, 100,000 dogs and 200,000 pigeons were enrolled in the war effort, according to Eric Baratay, a French historian specializing in the response of animals to the chaos, fear and smells of death in the mission that man thrust upon them.\n\nWorld War I marked the start of industrial warfare, with tanks, trucks, aircraft and machine guns in action. But the growing sophistication of the instruments of death couldn\u2019t match the dog tasked with finding the wounded, the horses and mules hauling munitions and food or the pigeons serving as telecommunications operators or even eyes, carrying \u201cpigeongrams\u201d or tiny cameras to record German positions.\n\n\u201cThey were quasi-combatants,\u201d said Serge Barcellini, comptroller general of the Armed Forces and head of Le Souvenir Francais \u2013 The French Memory \u2013 in a recent speech devoted to the role played by beasts of war.\n\nIndeed, gas masks were fitted to the muzzles of four-legged warriors braving noxious battlefield fumes.\n\nIn France, as in Britain and elsewhere, horses and mules were requisitioned.\n\nOne typical sign posted in southern Paris ordered citizens to present their steeds and mules to the Requisition Committee by Nov. 14, 1914, or risk \u201cprosecution by the military authority.\u201d It was becoming clear there would be no quick end to the war that ground on for four more years.\n\n___\n\nFEATHERED HEROES\n\nCher Ami, or Dear Friend, the carrier pigeon who wouldn\u2019t quit, lived up to her name, saving the lives of 194 American troops of the \u201cLost Battalion\u201d of the 77th Infantry Division, isolated behind enemy lines during the 1918 Meuse-Argonne offensive in eastern France.\n\nAbout 550 men had held their ground against a far larger German force for days before coming under fire from American troops unaware the trapped soldiers weren\u2019t the enemy.\n\nOn Oct. 4, Maj. Charles Whittlesey sent Cher Ami into the skies with a final message giving the U.S. battalion\u2019s location, followed by a plea: \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake stop it.\u201d\n\nCher Ami lost an eye and a leg from German gunfire, but kept flying, around 25 miles (40 kilometers) in about a half-hour, according to the United States World War One Centennial Commission. Survivors of the \u201cLost Battalion\u201d returned to American lines four days later.\n\nAnother carrier pigeon named Vaillant, assigned to the French military, also performed extraordinary feats during the war.\n\nOn June 4, 1916, he was released into the sky with the desperate message, \u201cHe\u2019s my last pigeon.\u201d\n\nFrench Commander Sylvain Eugene Raynal, encircled by Germans at the Fort de Vaux near Verdun, was counting on Vaillant to save his men.\n\nThe feisty bird flew through toxic gas and smoke, reaching the Verdun pigeon loft choked by fumes. With no help arriving despite Vaillant\u2019s courageous effort, Raynal and his men surrendered three days later.\n\nBoth Cher Ami and Vaillant were awarded France\u2019s Croix de Guerre, or War Cross.\n\n___\n\nROUND \u2018EM UP\n\nHorses are ancient warriors, but most of those conscripted during World War I weren\u2019t war-ready. They died by the millions, from disease, exhaustion and enemy fire, forcing the French and British armies to turn to America to renew their supply. A veritable industry developed with more than half a million horses and mules shipped by boat to Europe by fall 1917, according to the American Battle Monuments Commission.\n\nSo important was the commerce that the Santa Fe Railroad named a station Drage, after British Lt. Col. F.B. Drage, the commander of the British Remount Commission in Lathrop, Missouri, a major stockyard for the future beasts of war.\n\n\u201cSo the war business in horses and mules is good,\u201d read an article in the December 1915 issue of The Santa Fe Magazine, for employees of the railway system. Good for the farmer, contractor, supplier and railroads, it said, but \u201cnot good for the animals.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSERVICE BY EXOTICS\n\nAmong the more exotic animals called into service was a baboon named Jackie, who served with the 1st South African Infantry Brigade in then British-occupied Egypt and later in the trenches in France and Belgium. His acute hearing and keen eyesight helped warn soldiers of enemy movement or possible attacks when he would screech and tug on their clothing.\n\nJackie was wounded in Flanders Fields when the South African brigade came under heavy shelling in April 1918 and his leg had to be amputated.\n\nLt. Col. R.N. Woodsend, of Britain\u2019s Royal Medical Corps, described that procedure: \u201cHe lapped up the chloroform as if it had been whiskey, and was well under in a remarkably short time. It was a simple matter to amputate the leg with scissors.\u201d\n\n___\n\nDOGS OF WAR\n\nMan\u2019s best friend helped soldiers survive. Dogs served, firstly, as spotters of the wounded, learning to identify ally from enemy. They also served as sentinels, messengers, transporters and chasers of rats \u2013 the bane of the trenches along with lice and fleas. The French military created a service devoted to dogs of war in December 1915.\n\nLess official, but crucial to soldiers\u2019 morale, was the role of dogs and other creatures in the trenches, and as mascots. Stray dogs running from fighting were adopted as companions along with other animals, including a Royal Air Force fox mascot adopted by British pilots.\n\nThese dogs and other mascots helped soldiers \u201cthink of life \u2026 and the life they hoped to find again,\u201d said Baratay, the French historian, in a speech last month in Paris.", "A majority of Germans say the level of mass migration has left them feeling \u201clike a stranger in their own country\u201d, according to a new study.\n\nPresented as part of this year\u2019s Leipzig University research into \u201cauthoritarian\u201d

the German population.\n\nWhile more than 90 per cent of Germans said they were a fan of democracy, the rise in \u2018xenophobic\u2019 attitudes poses a threat to the democratic system, according to the study\u2019s lead author, Oliver Decker.\n\nAsserting that the majority of the public has the concept of democracy all wrong, he said that \u201conly about half of respondents are satisfied with democracy in practice\u201d, pointing to the figure which showed 47 per cent of Germans disapproving of \u201copen society\u201d principles as evidence that, as the broadcaster phrased it, \u201cdemocracy itself could be threatened by democratically elected politicians\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis discrepancy between values is a problem in representative democracy,\u201d according to the Leipzig press release, which noted that the public feels powerless in terms of their ability to exert influence on Germany\u2019s politics.\n\nA study by think tank the Bertelsmann Foundation reported last month showed the so-called political centre in the country was in danger of hollowing out, with fewer voters identifying as centrist while populist attitudes such as the desire for more

Matt Gaetz (R-FL) told Fox Business Network\u2019s Lou Dobbs that Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes is in violation of state transparency laws.\n\nSnipes defied a court order allowing the inspection of vote records Friday evening. Gaetz will ask a judge to hold the official in contempt of court.\n\nEarlier Friday, a judge ordered Snipes to allow immediate inspection of voter records during an emergency hearing Friday. The court was asked to intervene in the tight U.S. Senate race between incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Gov. Rick Scott (R-FL) as the two sides prepare for a possible recount.\n\nJudge Carol-Lisa Phillip said Snipes must allow inspections on or before 7:00 p.m. Friday evening. Phillips found that Snipes violated the law by failing to turn over the information to attorneys for Scott\u2019s Senate campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\nLawyers for Snipes argued that requiring such a swift response would interfere with ongoing efforts to finish counting Broward County ballots. But lawyers for Scott contended the information is already required to be collected under state law and should take minutes to provide. Scott filed a lawsuit Thursday night against, asking the court to order Snipes to turn over several records detailing the counting and collection of ballots.\n\nHowever, Snipes\u2019 attorney said in court Friday that it would be inappropriate for the court to intervene at this time, simply because Scott wants the counting process to be sped up. The attorney said Snipes is not refusing to turn over the records, but needs more time to do so.\n\nScott\u2019s thin lead over Nelson has narrowed during the vote-counting in the days since he declared victory Tuesday night.\n\nA partial transcript is as follows:\n\nDOBBS: Congressman, I\u2019ve got to say, looking at [Brenda Snipes\u2019] record, what in the world is she doing in the job? GAETZ: Lou, it\u2019s like we\u2019ve got a banana republic down here in Broward County. Just hours ago a judge ruled that Brenda Snipes violated the Florida constitution by not allowing citizens to have access to basic records that were supposed to be produced. Easy stuff Lou, like how many ballots were cast? And who cast them? And where were they cast? This is something that almost every supervisor of elections, 65 out of 67, were able to get all of this information right in a matter of hours. We\u2019re now days later. Brenda Snipes, after getting a court order that she had to allow us to inspect that information, well, the deadline for that court order was 7 o\u2019clock. The top of your show. And she has not complied with it. When I\u2019m done here, we\u2019re going to go get motions for contempt prepared and we\u2019re going to be back in front of a judge to hold Brenda Snipes in contempt of court for not following court orders and not following the Florida constitution. The question is, \u201cwhat is Governor Rick Scott going to do about it?\u201d I think he needs to immediately suspend her and put this office in the receivership of the secretary of state. The secretary of state is the chief elections officer in Florida. This lady cannot do the job. She is either incompetent or corrupt and I don\u2019t want to wait around and find out which one it is. DOBBS: It might be both. GAETZ: It could be. DOBBS: It is stunning to me that she\u2019s still in office. How can that be after what she has not done and after what she has done, as you pointed out, she defied a court order, broke her constitutional duty, I mean what more does she have to do? GAETZ: That is a really appropriate question for Governor Rick Scott. I hope that Governor Rick Scott is is like scared because he\u2019s a candidate so he should fulfill the duties of the governor. 8 million ballots were cast in Florida, Lou.

He has had the courage and wisdom to stand up to the globalist elites, to stand up to the countries of the world that are engaging in unfair trade practices, non-reciprocal trade, high tariffs, using [the] United States as the bank of the world,\u201d Navarro said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nNavarro said a \u201cself-appointed group of Wall Street bankers and hedge fund managers\u201d were shuttling back and forth between Washington and Beijing, and warned them against trying to pressure the White House into making some kind of a deal to end a trade war with China.\n\n\u201cWhen these unpaid foreign agents engage in this kind of diplomacy \u2014 so-called diplomacy \u2014 all they do is weaken this president and his negotiating position. No good can come of this. If and when there is a deal, it will be on President Donald Trump\u2019s terms, not Wall Street\u2019s terms,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said \u201cif they want to do good, spend their billions in Dayton, Ohio, in the factory towns of America, where we need a rebirth of our manufacturing base.\u201d\n\nNavarro\u2019s talk comes ahead of the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President and discuss the ongoing U.S.-China trade war.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has made ending unfair Chinese trade practices with the U.S. a top priority. After trade negotiations stalled, Washington imposed tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports. Beijing retaliated in kind. The U.S. then imposed tariffs on an additional $200 billion of imports, with China retaliating with tariffs on $60 billion of American imports. Washington has threatened to further raise tariffs.\n\nExperts say the Trump administration has caught China off-guard with its tough stance. Most administrations have talked tough on the campaign trail, but have eased up once in office. Trump, however, has not relented.\n\n\u201cChina is sputtering. They\u2019ve never been treated this way. Every administration in the past has always treated them with kid gloves,\u201d a senior U.S. official told Breitbart News last month.\n\nNavarro unveiled a chart showing six strategies of \u201ceconomic aggression\u201d that he said China pursues: protecting their markets, attacking global markets, securing resources in poor countries, seeking to dominate traditional manufacturing, stealing technology and intellectual property, and using unfair policies and practices such as tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and currency manipulation.\n\nHe said the Chinese were unwilling to recognize even engaging in these strategies, making a deal impossible.\n\nHe said during a round of negotiations earlier this year, he and other advisers went to Beijing to negotiate with the Chinese. He said they put down a long list of demands. The Chinese refused to acknowledge U.S. concerns.\n\n\u201cWhat do we hear? \u2018We don\u2019t engage in cyber theft, we are the biggest victim of cyber theft, we don\u2019t force technology transfers.\u2019 How do you have a deal with somebody if they won\u2019t even acknowledge your concerns? It is Alice in Wonderland,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also accused China of trying to engage Washington in talks in order to continue unfair trade practices. \u201cThat\u2019s all they want to do. They want to get us to the bargaining table, sound reasonable, and talk their way while they keep having their way with us.\u201d\n\nNavarro also gave a comprehensive overview of Trump\u2019s efforts to rejuvenate the American manufacturing and defense industrial base.\n\nHe said Trump\u2019s maxim is \u201ceconomic security is national security,\u201d and he has applied it to tax cuts, deregulation, unleashing the energy sector and ending the war on coal, imposing steel and aluminum tariffs, and renegotiating trade agreements such as the the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n\n\u201cThis is a man that wakes up every day and thinks about how to put men and women back to work. Men and women who work with their hands in our manufacturing base to rebuild our community. Guess what? It\u2019s working,\u201d Navarro said.\n\n\u201cThe day that he was elected, business and consumer optimism jumped up. It has gone straight out since to historic levels. Now it is reflected in the data. We have historically low unemployment \u2014 3.7 percent. We have rising wages for a change. We have record low unemployment. Record low unemployment among Blacks, Hispanics, and women.\n\n\u201cThe rising wages are disproportionately being shared by the lower portions of the income stream \u2014 the Deplorables \u2014 the Trump voters \u2014 the people who voted this man into office,\u201d he said.", "As former Attorney General Jeff Sessions departed the Department of Justice (DOJ), a short list of potential replacements has surfaced in Washington, D.C.\n\nBelow, Breitbart News has compiled eight \u201cAmerica First\u201d candidates for Attorney General.\n\nKris Kobach\n\nCurrently, Kobach is serving the last couple of months as Kansas\u2019s Secretary of State. Kobach previously served as an adviser to President Trump on immigration, and most notably wrote Arizona\u2019s SB 1070 law that made it a state crime to be in the country as an illegal alien.\n\nHaving fought the open borders lobby in the courts, Kobach is the most obvious choice to replace Sessions when it comes to suing the state of California for their sanctuary state law. Kobach is likely to expand on Sessions\u2019 border reforms and tightening of asylum loopholes.\n\nKobach has also been at the forefront of tackling voter fraud. He has taken on the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) which has attempted to stop his election integrity law that requires voters to prove their citizenship. Kobach has taken on 14 cases of voter fraud in Kansas since 2015. Those cases have either already ended in convictions or are currently pending.\n\nJeff Landry\n\nLandry is Louisiana\u2019s sitting Attorney General and the president of the National Association of Attorneys General. As a staunch conservative and ally of Trump, Landry encouraged then-AG Jeff Sessions to break up social media tech giants, saying \u201cI think the companies are too big and they need to be broken up.\u201d That would be a welcome sentiment to the Trump administration, which has railed against the censorship of conservatives online.\n\nThe Louisiana Attorney General, in August, made clear how he would handle corporate gun control by denying a $600 million road financing plan to Citibank and the Bank of America after both companies placed new gun controls on banking customers. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, he slammed the corporations for \u201ctrying to become the social police.\u201d\n\nLandry also pushed to outlaw sanctuary cities in Louisiana \u2014 a sign he is willing and ready to take on Sessions\u2019 California lawsuit \u2014 though the state\u2019s Democrat and Republican political establishments stopped the measure from becoming law.\n\nMatthew Whitaker\n\nActing Attorney General Matt Whitaker, who has immediately taken over since Sessions\u2019 resignation, is said to be in the same populist-nationalist mold as his former boss, sources tell Breitbart News. Whitaker formerly worked closely with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) \u2014 who praised him this week.\n\nWhitaker had served as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff since October 2017, making him a close ally to the former Alabama senator during major battles at the Justice Department, including filing suit against California, defending Trump\u2019s travel ban in court, and the agency\u2019s effort to cripple the drug cartels.\n\nSimilar to many conservative legal scholars, Whitaker has criticized the power the Supreme Court has amassed in the enacting of public policy. More specifically, Whitaker attacked the landmark Marbury v. Madison ruling that established judicial review.\n\nJudge A. Raymond Randolph\n\nRandolph is on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and had friendships with both newly-confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and former Solicitor General Robert Bork. Randolph shot to fame during the Bush era when he wrote the landmark majority opinion that stated that Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees did not have rights under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court overturned Randolph\u2019s majority opinion, he blasted the decision in a speech at the Heritage Foundation, calling the ruling \u201cThe Guantanamo Mess\u201d and delivering the same style of robust defense of national security that Trump often deploys.\n\nLamar Smith\n\nThe Texas congressman is set to retire after this year. In Congress, Smith was most notable for championing protections for American workers against wage-crushing illegal immigration and illegal hiring by repeatedly advocating for mandatory E-Verify. At the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, Smith would likely continue Sessions\u2019 crackdown on businesses that are caught abusing visa programs to hire foreign workers over American citizens.\n\nTwo cases before the Justice Department at the moment involve Harvard and Yale, where both are accused of discriminating against Asian-Americans in their admissions process. Smith in the late 1990s voted to end preferential treatment by race in college admissions.\n\nKen Paxton\n\nThe current Attorney General of Texas made headlines in the last two years when he led a lawsuit against the federal government, mandating that President Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program be immediately ended.\n\nPaxton\u2019s lawsuit ultimately forced the Trump administration into ending DACA sooner than they had planned. This suit is of particular importance because the Justice Department is requesting that the Supreme Court bypass the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and review the legality of the administration\u2019s ending of the amnesty program.\n\nOn health care, Paxton filed suit against Obama\u2019s signature legislation, Obamacare, calling it unconstitutional on grounds that the law violates states\u2019 rights.\n\nPatrick Morrisey\n\nMorrisey is the West Virginia Attorney General who last week lost his bid against Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin and has been called the \u201ctip of the spear\u201d for the anti-establishment movement against the Washington, D.C. beltway. Morrisey is staunchly pro-Second Amendment and pro-life, touting his support for a constitutional amendment to ban taxpayer-funded abortions.\n\nIn a state like West Virginia, which has been inundated with illegal drugs, Morrisey has made combatting the opioid crisis, drug trafficking, and drug lords a major priority of his tenure as the state\u2019s Attorney General. Morrisey successfully forced the hand of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to change national drug policy that he said will lead \u201cto significant reductions in the illicit pills that flow into our state.\u201d\n\nMorrisey started the \u201cCombating Addiction with Grace\u201d program in West Virginia, which seeks to fight the state\u2019s drug epidemic by working closely with faith-based organizations to form plans of action.\n\nJan Brewer\n\nFormer Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is likely the most famous of all the eight potential candidates for Attorney General. While governor, Brewer signed into law SB 1070 \u2014 which Kobach authored \u2014 to criminalize illegal immigration in the state. In 2011, Brewer said the action was necessary because the federal government refused to secure her state\u2019s border with Mexico.\n\nDuring her time as a lawmaker and governor, Brewer has earned an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA). This is noteworthy because the Justice Department in March proposed a regulation to ban bump stocks despite little support for such gun control measures among Trump\u2019s base of support.", "Incoming House Democrats are promising to push the same gun control that failed to stop the Thousand Oaks, California, massacre.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that every one of the newly elected Democrats has an F-rating from the NRA, and they are ready to flaunt it.\n\nPro-gun control Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) spoke for his fellow party members, saying, \u201cThis new majority is not going to be afraid of our shadow. We know that we\u2019ve been elected to do a job, and we\u2019re going to do it.\u201d\n\nThompson noted that the passage of universal background checks is number one on their list.\n\nCalifornia already has universal background checks. However, the Thousand Oaks attacker \u201clegally purchased\u201d his handgun and allegedly attacked defenseless innocents in a gun-free zone.\n\nUniversal background checks are not enforceable without gun registration requirements, so California has those requirements too. And arguments are constantly made that registration leads to confiscation, and California has confiscation laws too.\n\nIn fact, California already has every law that the national Democrat Party is trying to heave onto the backs of the American people, including a red flag law. Yet, not a single one of the laws posed the slightest hindrance to the determined attacker who reportedly killed 12 at the Borderline Bar & Grill Wednesday.\n\nThe incoming Democrats to not care about the inefficacy of gun control, and Thompson says gun control legislation will be passed \u201cin the opening weeks of Congress.\u201d\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Those who know that the holiday began as Armistice Day typically think of it as a day of victory and peace.\n\nHowever, for those on the ground in Europe the last twenty-four hours before the cessation of hostilities on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918, that day was nothing less than hell on earth.\n\nOne hundred years ago this weekend, Allied commanders ordered U.S. Marines and Army personnel to attempt a perilous night crossing of the Meuse River and assault the heavily defended German positions on the far side. Prescient, General Black Jack Pershing foresaw the possible rise of Germany and wanted to make it clear the Allies had won the war by seizing more German-controlled territory. Scores of men would die in an attack that ultimately proved a tragic loss of life.\n\nI retell the story of that harrowing night in my new bestselling book, The Unknowns: The Untold Story of America\u2019s Unknown Soldier and WWI\u2019s Most Decorated Heroes Who Brought Him Home. It follows eight American heroes who accomplished extraordinary feats in some of the war\u2019s most important battles. As a result of their bravery, these eight men were selected to serve as Body Bearers at the ceremony where the Unknown Soldier was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nSeveral of those Body Bearers took part in that final barrage on the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Body Bearer Corporal Thomas Saunders, a Native American from Wyoming who received the Distinguished Service Cross and other honors for his previous heroism at Jaulny, worked with the other members of the 2nd Engineers to construct the flimsy footbridges that would span the river. German artillery had destroyed all the permanent bridges in the area, so Saunders and his comrades designed some floating bridges that they hoped would last long enough to get their men across. To avoid enemy snipers, they prefabricated the bridges in sections \u2014 each roughly the width of a ladder and twelve feet long \u2014 well back from the front lines. Teams of mules then hauled the sections near the river.\n\nThe Americans knew the Germans had countless fortified machine-gun nests along the bank of the Meuse, as well as heavy artillery zeroed in on the likely crossing points. Stepping out onto the footbridges without cover fire would have meant immediate death.\n\nTo soften up the German defenses, American field artillery, including Body Bearer and Color Sergeant James W. Dell\u2019s 75mm artillery battery, began the attack by firing for an hour straight on the narrow strip of land between the riverbank and the woods beyond. When the hour was up, they turned their guns on known German positions, hoping to keep them pinned down long enough for the Marines to make the crossing.\n\nFortunately for the Americans, the weather was working in their favor. A thick, cold fog settled in, shrouding their movements and deadening sound. In single file, the Marines attached to the 49th Company, including Body Bearer and Gunnery Sergeant Ernest Janson, trudged through the darkness in total silence. The men were intensely uncomfortable. They were tired from weeks of hard fighting, and their uniforms were soaked through. Many suffered the effects of the worldwide influenza plague, but they stifled their coughs and sneezes, knowing that the smallest sound would bring German machine-gun fire down on their heads.\n\nSaunders and the fighting engineers led they way, carrying the heavy footbridge sections above their heads. They struggled to keep their footing on the slippery rocks but somehow managed to float the bridge out onto the freezing water. A brave engineer clung to the front of the contraption, rifle in hand, kneeling on the waterlogged planks as they floated across the river. Miraculously, the current drifted the lone soldier across the Meuse, and he tied the guideline onto a tree on the eastern side.\n\nThe Americans had succeeded in creating a path across the river \u2014 but it was a path straight into the mouth of hell.\n\nThe engineers actually placed two bridges across the river that night in separate locations, but the Germans destroyed one almost immediately. With no way to cross, the 6th Marines turned around and dug shallow fighting holes in a nearby wood.\n\nUndoubtedly, the rumors of an approaching armistice played a role in their decision. For several days, men had been talking about a possible end to the war. Unbeknownst to the men, the two sides actually signed a peace deal at 5:45 a.m. on the morning of November 11. But General Pershing chose not to provide that information to the men fighting on the banks of the Meuse. He merely passed along the order to cease fire at exactly 11:00 a.m. Many of the Leathernecks and soldiers on the front lines would perish in the intervening hours.\n\nAs the Marines approached the river, a gleaming white star shell arced across the inky sky, silhouetting Saunders and his men, along with members of the Janson\u2019s 49th Company and the other Marines. Staccato fire from machine guns obliterated the relative silence. An enemy patrol set up their Maxims on the far bank and sprayed lead like a fire hose.\n\nMen slid and slipped down the embankment next to the river, shrapnel from artillery shells tore through their ranks.

Many others never even got to the water; their bodies piled up on the eastern side of the river.\n\nHowever, scores had made it across when the Germans scored a direct hit on the bridge. The men on the Western side of the river were now trapped in enemy territory.

What the Marines did know is that they had leaders they trusted and followed to the end. They had each other \u2014 a fellowship forged only in battle. This bond kept many of the men alive.\n\nMany Marines died there on that eastern bank of the Meuse before the guns suddenly went silent at 11:00. At a congressional hearing after the war, Pershing and his command would claim they were under the direction of Marshal Foch and had no orders to cease fighting until 11 a.m. on November 11.

But the matter has received renewed examination in recent months as the White House seeks to stake out a tough stance on Iranian-linked groups across the Middle East, they said. A formal terrorist designation by the State Department could further isolate the rebels, members of a minority Shiite Muslim sect who seized control of Yemen\u2019s capital in late 2014, but critics warn that such a move might also worsen already dire humanitarian conditions without pushing the conflict closer to a conclusion.\n\nThe internationally-recognized government of Yemeni President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi formally requested that the United Nations designate the Shiite Houthi rebels a terrorist organization in February 2017, apparently to no avail.\n\nIn March 2015, a U.S.-backed Saudi Arabia Sunni coalition launched an ongoing offensive against the Iran-allied Houthis to restore Hadi back to power.\n\nU.S. and Saudi coalition officials have determined that the Shiite government of Iran is assisting the Houthis, allowing them to continue waging their terror campaign.\n\nIran\u2019s regional foe Saudi Arabia has already taken steps to designate the Houthis terrorists.\n\nThe U.S. considers Iran the world\u2019s leading state-sponsor of terror and one of the top threats facing the United States.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in charge of making FTO designations.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State explains, \u201cFTO designations play a critical role in our fight against terrorism and are an effective means of curtailing support for terrorist activities and pressuring groups to get out of the terrorism business.\u201d\n\nAlthough the U.S. has not officially designated the group as an FTO, \u201cHouthi extremists\u201d made a list published by DOS of the top five deadliest terrorist groups in the globe in 2016 with 267 attacks that killed 374 people and injured 568 others.

Mallet\u2019s rejection was the latest in a string of incidents that have profoundly alarmed free speech and human rights advocates.\n\nMallet \u201cattempted to enter Hong Kong on Thursday as a visitor but was turned away at the border after several hours of questioning by immigration officers,\u201d according to a statement from the Financial Times.\n\nAccording to the statement, Mallet wished to return to Hong Kong to \u201cfinalize some personal matters after having to relocate overseas at short notice in October.\u201d\n\nMallet was refused entry by the authorities without explanation. Hong Kong security officials simply insisted he was kept out for reasons that have \u201cnothing to do with freedom of expression and freedom of the press.\u201d\n\nThe government has provided no formal explanation for the refusal to renew his work visa, although many widely suspect it to be retaliation for a speech he hosted at the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club by independence activist Andy Chan, leader of the now-banned Hong Kong National Party.\n\n\u201cThe rejection came on the same day that two Hong Kong talks by a London-based Chinese author were canceled, a move that critics argued was a further step in a trend of increasing restrictions on free speech in the territory,\u201d FT added.\n\nThe author in question, Ma Jian, wrote a novel called China Dream that satirizes Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping\u2019s nationalist agenda. Ma found no Hong Kong publisher willing to handle his novel, but it will be published in Taiwan in 2019. Hong Kong publishers who print books critical of Chinese Communist leadership have been known to vanish and reappear in mainland Chinese prisons.\n\nThe venue hosting the Hong Kong International Literary Festival canceled his appearances because it did not wish to \u201cbecome a platform to promote the political interests of any individual.\u201d\n\nAfter a second venue canceled backup plans to host Ma, the original site of the Hong Kong International Literary Festival changed its mind on Friday and agreed to let him appear.\n\n\u201cMr. Ma has made public statements which clarify that his appearances in Hong Kong are as a novelist and that he has no intention to use Tai Kwun as a platform to promote his personal political interests,\u201d said Timothy Calnin, director of the recently opened Tai Kwun arts complex.\n\nMa said he was worried he would be banned from entering the city after Victor Mallet was denied entry, even though Ma is a legal permanent resident dating back to before the U.K. handed Hong Kong over to China in 1997. He reported on Friday that he was able to enter the city without incident.\n\n\u201cThe talk must go on. Even if only one Hong Konger wants to attend. Even if only one reader wants to talk to me,\u201d Ma vowed, denouncing the original decision to cancel his talks as \u201cterrifying.\u201d\n\nThe Hong Kong Journalists Association and several other media groups agreed with Ma\u2019s grim assessment, contributing a joint editorial to the Hong Kong Free Press on Friday that declared it a \u201cdark week for freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Mallet and Ma, the editorial cited the case of Australia-based Chinese political cartoonist known as Badiucao, whose Free Expression Week exhibition was canceled on November 2 due to \u201cthreats made by the Chinese authorities relating to the artist.\u201d Human-rights advocates said they were shocked by the brute-force cancellation of Badiucao\u2019s show.\n\nThe authors and cosigners of the editorial warned Hong Kong\u2019s days as \u201cthe world\u2019s number one free economy\u201d are coming to an end:\n\nAuthorities have been expanding the no-go areas of what may be said.

If people can no longer speak their mind, what place is there for press freedom? If voices critical of Beijing\u2019s policies cannot be tolerated today, who is to say when a report forecasting a devaluation of Renminbi will be disappeared?

The riots are so common they have a name: actos de repudio, or \u201cacts of repudiation.\u201d\n\nIn the past several years, since dictator Ra\u00fal Castro took over for late dictator brother Fidel, Cuba has endeavored to export the practice of actos de repudio, attacking the presence of dissidents at international summit events, violently beating them in public on foreign soil, and even using mob behavior to silence American diplomats at the United Nations.\n\nThe incident this week organized by a violent group calling itself \u201cSmash Racism DC\u201d is evidence that, at least among the American left, Cuba\u2019s campaign is succeeding.\n\nBabal\u00fa Blog, a political online publication tracking Cuban government news, defines an acto de repudio as \u201cbully mobs [used] to intimidate, instill fear, and to restrict democracy activist\u2019s freedom of movement and speech.\u201d\n\nThis is what happened to Tucker Carlson\u2019s family:\n\nThe protesters can be heard chanting \u201cTucker Carlson, we will fight. We know where you sleep at night.\u201d The video shows only the early part of the protest, omitting the violence that followed. Carlson was not home at the time of the attack.\n\n\u201cI called my wife. She had been in the kitchen alone getting ready to go to dinner and she heard pounding on the front door and screaming. \u2026 Someone started throwing himself against the front door and actually cracked the front door,\u201d Carlson told The Washington Post.\n\nAccording to the official police report, the mob vandalized the Carlson home, driveway, and the car parked there by scrawling various leftist messages all over them. The mob also broke the front door, nearly managing to enter the home to presumably hurt Carlson\u2019s family. Washington, DC, police are investigating the incident as a hate crime.\n\nCarlson accurately described the attack as an attempt to silence his political thoughts in a subsequent interview Thursday night on Fox News.\n\n\u201cThis has a chilling effect on people\u2019s ability to speak and to think freely. That\u2019s the point,\u201d he argued. \u201cIt\u2019s totalitarian in its intent. We should fight it.\u201d\n\nThe social media presence of \u201cSmash Racism DC\u201d clearly shows that the intent of the event was to threaten Carlson until he felt he had to choose between his right to free expression and his family\u2019s safety. On Twitter, the group wrote: \u201cTonight, we remind you that you are not safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it like to find out that your wife is hiding in the pantry because people are threatening her? I mean, it\u2019s upsetting,\u201d he noted.\n\nWith some notable exceptions on the far left, mainstream political observers have condemned the attack as fundamentally anti-American and argued that such mob tyranny is a scary new development in political speech, practically unprecedented. Those who view this as a novel threat have clearly not studied the Ladies in White, a group of pro-democracy peace activists in Cuba who experience some form of this harassment on a weekly basis.\n\nUnlike the Antifa event, the Ladies in White, and in particular their leader Berta Soler, face similar attacks organized and funded by their own government. The women, whose sole act of protest is to attempt to go to Catholic Mass on Sundays, have faced beatings, stoning, tarring at the hands of these mobs.\n\nIn a memorable 2016 acto de repudio, a mob made a bonfire out of copies of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a reminder that its ideals do not apply to them.\n\nBelow, a video of another acto de repudio in front of Berta Soler\u2019s home in Havana in 2016:\n\nAnother group routinely facing mob attacks is the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU). The acto de repudio below occurred in 2015 in Holgu\u00edn city:\n\nThe attacks are not limited to political opponents. Below is a mob attack against Tania Bruguera, a Cuban artist who courted the ire of the regime by planning an art installation consisting only of a microphone placed in the Plaza of the Revolution in Havana for the use of anyone in the public to say whatever they want. Bruguera has an official Cuban police officer assigned to monitor her at all times.\n\nIn 2015, the Cuban government decided to begin exporting actos de repudio after being invited to the Summit of the Americas for the first time. At the time, Latin American leaders like Venezuelan dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, corrupt Brazilian socialist Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and similarly corrupt Argentine former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner hijacked the summit to invite Cuba despite the nation not meeting the Organization of American States\u2019 democracy requirements.\n\nThe Cuban state agents used the invitation to stage actos de repudio in Panama. The agents physically beat a small group of dissidents who gathered to honor Cuban founding father Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed in Panama City.\n\nFacing no repercussions, the Cuban delegation at the 2018 Summit of the Americas in Per\u00fa similarly used mob tactics to silence pro-democracy voices \u2013 this time, rather than doing so at an unofficial event, orchestrating an acto de repudio at the site of the summit.\n\nThe international community failed to shut it down. So, last month, the Cubans did it again, organizing a loud, angry mob to yell over American diplomats discussing human rights at the United Nations headquarters in New York. The United Nations refused to remove the mob, so they continued to make noise for nearly an hour.\n\nClearly, someone at \u201cSmash Racism DC\u201d thought that, if the policy has worked for the Castro regime, it might work for them.\n\nThe extensive, repulsive history of mob attacks in Cuba similar to what Carlson experienced \u2013 and their increased frequency abroad since 2015, when the Obama administration flooded Cuba with foreign investment in return for nothing \u2013 is a reminder that interacting with foreign regimes does not necessarily make them freer. Sometimes, values flow in the opposite direction, resulting in authoritarian minorities in the free country becoming emboldened and infected with the same tactics common in the repressive regime. Antifa groups adopting Cuban state tactics is little different than watching Silicon Valley tech companies growing to prefer communist China\u2019s approach to internet censorship to America\u2019s longstanding respect for individual expression after years of China economic favoritists insisting that enriching the Communist Party will somehow make China \u201cfreer.\u201d The abyss always looks back into you.\n\nThe attack on Carlson\u2019s family should not be a surprise and will not be the last of its kind. Understanding the historical and global context of the leftists who orchestrated it, however, is indispensable to protect the uniquely American right-wing morality that leads to rejecting such behavior.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "Actor Ashton Kutcher responded to Wednesday\u2019s shooting in Borderline Bar & Grill by begging Ivanka Trump to convince her father to push \u201cgun control now.\u201d\n\nKutcher used Twitter to explain that he celebrated his most recent birthday party at Borderline, tweeting, \u201cMy wife threw me a birthday party this year at the Borderline.

NRATV host Cam Edwards pointed this out after Kutcher tweeted about his friend giving him a gun in the parking lot of the bar.\n\nI think Ashton Kutcher just admitted to violating California law. Firearms transfers have to go through a federally licensed firearms dealer who performs a background check and holds the firearm for the mandatory 10-day waiting period. https://t.co/GN0TH1kzeO \u2014 Cam Edwards (@CamEdwards) November 9, 2018\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

In the post, Facebook claims to have removed 9.4 million pieces of terrorism-related content during the second quarter of 2018 and another 3 million posts during the third quarter. This shows a significant increase from May when the company stated that they had removed 1.9 million posts during the first quarter of 2018.\n\nIn the blog post, written by the company\u2019s Global Head of Policy Management, Monika Bickert, and Brian Fishman, the head of counterterrorism policy, the two executives stated: \u201cOnline terrorist propaganda is a fairly new phenomenon; terrorism itself is not. In the real world, terrorist groups have proven highly resilient to counterterrorism efforts, so it shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone that the same dynamic is true on social platforms like Facebook. The more we do to detect and remove terrorist content, the more shrewd these groups become.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the addition of new machine-learning techniques to their platform, the blog post reads:\n\nWe now use machine learning to assess Facebook posts that may signal support for ISIS or al-Qaeda. The tool produces a score indicating how likely it is that the post violates our counterterrorism policies, which, in turn, helps our team of reviewers prioritize posts with the highest scores. In this way, the system ensures that our reviewers are able to focus on the most important content first. In some cases, we will automatically remove posts when the tool indicates with very high confidence that the post contains support for terrorism. We still rely on specialized reviewers to evaluate most posts, and only immediately remove posts when the tool\u2019s confidence level is high enough that its \u201cdecision\u201d indicates it will be more accurate than our human reviewers. At Facebook\u2019s scale neither human reviewers nor powerful technology will prevent all mistakes.

Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott has announced he will sue the county for mishandling the election.\n\nIn 2016, Snipes had a lawsuit filed against her office by the American Civil Rights Union after they claimed she had more voters on the rolls in the county than eligible citizens in the area at one point.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, filed by the Public Interest Legal Foundation, Broward County had more voters on their voter rolls than eligible citizens with a 103 percent voter registration rate.\n\nThe lawsuit also accused Broward County of having nearly 50 registered voters on the rolls who were older than the oldest living American at the time. One of those voters was allegedly listed as being 130-years-old.\n\nAnother 1,200 voters allegedly remained on the Broward County rolls despite using ineligible commercial addresses and about 23 percent of the voters who died in 2011 were allegedly still on the county voter rolls in May 2012, the lawsuit stated.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, in May, a judge ruled that Snipes had violated state and federal law after she destroyed voter ballots in the state\u2019s 2016 congressional election.

In response, the TLP organized thousands-strong violent mobs in Pakistan\u2019s major cities, forcing schools and businesses to shut down and destroying public and private property.\n\nBibi has reportedly left prison but the government has kept her in an undisclosed location to protect her from the mobs who want her and the Supreme Court justices who acquitted her killed. Her family is seeking asylum in the West, arguing that radical Muslim groups will not permit her to have a normal life in the country.\n\nThe largest riots ended on Friday after the government announced a deal with the TLP to accept yet another appeal on the Bibi case, over the heads of the Supreme Court, and begin the process to ban her from leaving the country. In exchange, TLP leadership needed only to apologize for blocking roads.\n\nThe ruling Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) relied heavily on support from Islamist groups to take power in this year\u2019s election, leading some to suspect that the government will not act to punish violent acts and rhetoric.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Minister of State for Interior Shehryar Afridi issued remarks blaming not the TLP, which publicly organized mass riots last week, for the violence. Instead, Afridi said that members of the main opposition party Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) were in part responsible, according to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn.\n\nAfridi told the Pakistani Senate that the TLP had claimed not to have any involvement in property destruction.\n\n\u201cWe showed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) the footage of the people being violent on the streets and they disowned them,\u201d he asserted. He added that TLP leaders had \u201capologized\u201d for insults against the ruling government and \u201cchided those criticizing the TLP leaders for using derogatory language against the judiciary, military and govern.\u201d\n\nAfridi added that the major reason for Pakistan refusing to punish TLP leaders was a financial one, asking, \u201cGod forbid, if Pakistan is placed on the [Financial Action Task Force] FATF blacklist on the grounds of the violence footage and the speeches made in parliament, who will be responsible?\u201d\n\nThe FATF list of \u201cNon-Cooperative Countries or Territories\u201d identifies countries that do not sufficiently protect against money laundering or terrorist financing and serves as motivation for global industries to stay out of those areas. Pakistan is listed as a \u201cmonitored jurisdiction\u201d but not yet on the red \u201ccall for action\u201d list.\n\nThe attack on other opposition parties not associated with the TLP, and the PML-N in particular, followed favorable remarks on the parties by Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry on Monday. \u201c[The opposition parties] told the world that Pakistan is united,\u201d he had said, attacking the protesters directly.\n\n\u201cThe way they (protesters) pulled rickshaw drivers out [of their vehicles] and set fire to their rickshaws, mistreated women by dragging them out of their cars and setting the cars alight [shows] that they don\u2019t have any moral values,\u201d he asserted. \u201cThey wear the garb of religion, but they have no connection to religion.\u201d\n\nThat same day, however, members of the PTI and socialist Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) in Congress attacked each other physically over the TLP deal. The altercation was preceded by members of the PML-N complaining that the TLP deal was too favorable to the Islamists, while PTI government officials noted that the PML-N similarly signed deals with the TLP to get the group to stop disrupting public life with riots while the party was in power.\n\nOn Friday, Dawn reported that 19 TLP members with warrants to their names were suddenly free of any criminal charges in Islamabad. The newspaper did not note whether the government provided any information on why these individuals would no longer face arrest despite participating in the riots.\n\nThe TLP has threatened further riots if Bibi is allowed to flee the country. Pakistani officials on Thursday and Friday insisted that she remained in the country, but not in prison.\n\nBibi was arrested in 2009 after two co-workers accused her of insulting Muhammad during a disagreement over whether she, as a Christian, could drink out of a cup that the Muslim co-workers wanted to use. Bibi has consistently denied that she said anything about Muhammad or Islam during their altercation. The Supreme Court found last week that the accusers had not provided any verifiable evidence against Bibi and ruled that she be immediately released.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "Carolina Panthers defensive tackle Kyle Love is taking a ribbing today on social media, after video seemed to show him nodding off during the Panther\u2019s game against the Steelers on Thursday.\n\nA short video clip of the player sitting on the sidelines spurred fans to wonder if Love fell asleep sitting on the bench during the Panthers\u2019 52-21 loss to Pittsburgh.\n\nBarstool Sports joked that Love and his team were \u201ctapped out\u201d on Thursday as the Steelers ran all over them.\n\nMany others wondered what was going on, there, too.\n\nSports writer Larry Brown of Yardbarker wondered, \u201cWas he taking a nap?

Maybe he\u2019ll catch some crap in the film room for that \u2014 if he\u2019s awake for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you stayed awake for the end of Panthers-Steelers\u2026you one-upped one specific member of the Carolina Panthers,\u201d 12Up\u2019s Adam Weinrib joked.\n\nIndeed, many fans felt that the video of Love dozing off on the sidelines was a perfect metaphor for the way the Panthers played that night.\n\n\u201cIf you thought the Panthers defense looked like they were sleeping against the Steelers,\u201d one fan said on Twitter, \u201cit\u2019s because they actually were.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Love has not commented on the viral video.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "Harried doctors fighting the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) fear it may become the worst outbreak of the deadly disease in the region to date, as an ongoing insurgency slows treatment and accelerates contamination.\n\n\u201cWe are absolutely concerned about the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo,\u201d a senior official with USAID said on Thursday. \u201cIt is occurring in an area of active conflict, so physical insecurity is a persistent challenge and complication to the ongoing response efforts.\u201d\n\nOn the positive side, the official said the outbreak is \u201cnot comparable at this point to the outbreak that occurred in West Africa in 2014,\u201d meaning it does not threaten to spread across an \u201cincredibly large geographic area.\u201d\n\nEbola cases have been mostly limited to two towns in the North Kivu province of the DRC, but the rate of new cases has accelerated during the past few weeks. USAID and the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) have deployed dozens of experts to work with the DRC Health Ministry since the outbreak began in August.\n\nOn Friday, Sky News watched doctors don biohazard suits and struggle to handle the influx of patients to a \u201cramshackle hospital\u201d made from \u201cwooden huts and temporary tents\u201d in the city of Beni. The hospital only has 60 beds, but Sky News correspondents counted 92 new patients admitted on the day of their visit, among them a pregnant woman and a three-year-old girl.\n\nDoctors reported 308 \u201cconfirmed\u201d or \u201cprobable\u201d cases of Ebola in the outbreak, approaching the highest total ever seen in the Congo. Thirty of them are children under ten years of age, suggesting the latest strain of Ebola is spreading faster among children than previous strains. So far, 191 patients have died.\n\nInternational aid workers said local residents are working more smoothly with doctors than some previous populations affected by Ebola, a disease that tends to spread panic and mistrust among its victims. Officials were especially optimistic about the success of \u201ccommunity surveillance\u201d programs designed to track the movements of infected people and quickly identify others who may have been exposed to Ebola. More effective vaccinations were also credited with keeping the death toll down.\n\nThe bad news is that CDC Director Robert Redfield warned on Monday the current outbreak may not be containable because it is spreading through an active war zone, making it harder to implement the procedures that have been helpful so far.\n\nThe Washington Post augmented Redfield\u2019s warning with some discouraging notes about the difficult situation faced by aid workers:\n\nDozens of armed militias operate in the area, attacking government outposts and civilians, complicating the work of Ebola response teams and putting their security at risk. Violence has escalated in recent weeks, severely hampering the response. The daily rate of new Ebola cases more than doubled in early October. In addition, there is community resistance and deep mistrust of the government. Some sick people have refused to go to treatment centers, health-care workers are still being infected, and some people are dying of Ebola or spreading the virus to new areas. An estimated 60 to 80 percent of new confirmed cases have no known epidemiological link to prior cases, making it very difficult for responders to track cases and stop transmission. In late August, the United States withdrew some of the CDC\u2019s most seasoned Ebola experts who had been stationed in Beni, the province\u2019s urban epicenter, because of security risks.\n\nThe outbreak is threatening to spread into much less isolated towns, such as the trading port of Butembo, introducing the risk of wider transmission chains that become even more difficult to trace.\n\nAngry rock-throwing mobs have confronted some medical teams when they attempt to secure the bodies of fatal Ebola victims. Experts on the local population explained they are sometimes terrified at the sight of medical teams in hazmat suits, driven by deep distrust of the DRC government, which they blame for keeping them in poverty and allowing armed rebel groups to prey upon them. Some locals apparently believe their government is fabricating Ebola warnings in a bid to frighten them away from their homes.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council passed a resolution on Tuesday demanding safer working conditions for medical teams in the outbreak zone, but concerned analysts said the international community has a poor track record of controlling insurgents in the Congo, even lacking reliable information about how many rebel groups are active in the area. Meanwhile, the DRC government has been criticized for abandoning rural areas and shifting its troops into the cities, where the government fears mass demonstrations could break out.", "A wildfire blazing so quickly that firefighters couldn\u2019t hope to stop it quadrupled in size Friday after destroying several thousand buildings and leveling much of a Northern California town of nearly 30,000 people, according to state authorities.

More details to come.\n\n8:01 PM: People have scoured evacuation centers, called authorities and posted desperate online pleas for help finding relatives they haven\u2019t heard from since a fast-moving wildfire devastated a Northern California town, according to the Associated Press.\n\nOver a day after tens of thousands evacuated the town of Paradise and the nearby community of Magalia, dozens of people, many of them elderly, remained unaccounted for. Anguished relatives flooded social media asking for help locating their loved ones. Hours later, some were relieved to be reunited with family hours later. Diane Forsman, who lives in New Hampshire, said her 83-year-old mother can\u2019t walk on her own and relies on oxygen. Her caretaker wasn\u2019t able to reach her Thursday morning when the fire swept through Magalia.\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying,\u201d Forsman said by telephone. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to remain hopeful until we get word. We don\u2019t know what the outcome will be.\u201d\n\nShe and her brother posted on social media to see if anyone had seen Jean Forsman. They tried calling 911 and other numbers. They were told officials had a list of 300 to 400 welfare checks to do. Finally, they got word through Facebook on Friday morning that someone in her neighborhood had picked up a woman with disabilities. But the Forsmans haven\u2019t been able to confirm yet whether it\u2019s their mom. Many of the missing are seniors without cellphones or social media accounts who had moved to the Northern California area that\u2019s known as a refuge for retirees. About one-fourth of Paradise\u2019s 27,000 residents are 65 years or older.\n\nWhen it was time to evacuate, Suzanne Drews couldn\u2019t get to her 84-year-old mother, who lives east of her in Paradise. Helen Pace lived by herself in a mobile home park with other seniors and didn\u2019t have a cellphone. Drews registered on several websites set up for missing persons and went to evacuation sites searching for Pace. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to worry. We\u2019ll keep looking and praying,\u201d Drews said by phone Friday afternoon. \u201cI\u2019m praying that she\u2019s at peace, that she\u2019s comfortable enough and not panicking.\u201d Cherri Rolla\u2019s family hasn\u2019t heard from her 83-year-old aunt, Sylvia Johnson, who lives in Paradise with at least six dogs and three horses. Rolla said a grandson living nearby tried to get Johnson to leave Thursday but she refused.\n\n\u201cWhen he went back, they wouldn\u2019t let him in,\u201d said Rolla, who lives of North Dakota. \u201cThe hardest part is to be so far away and not figure out what we\u2019re going to try to do to find her.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, they got a call that a woman at a church in Oroville may be Johnson. \u201cWe don\u2019t have 100 percent confirmation that it\u2019s her,\u201d Rolla said. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to get too terribly excited.\u201d Families were aided on Twitter by the actor James Woods who posted and retweeted messages from those looking for missing people. The hashtag he started became a central hub for people trying to reunite with their loved ones. Steve Christensen drove up more than 130 miles (210 kilometers) from Sutter Creek to Chico and spent Friday trying to find his wife\u2019s sister, Debbie McCrea, and her boyfriend.\n\nMcCrea lives on a quarter-acre lot in Paradise and has had to evacuate from wildfires several times. Usually she calls her sister and others to let them know she\u2019s getting out. Not this time. \u201cShe\u2019s evacuated before, so she should know the routine. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m concerned that she hasn\u2019t called us,\u201d said Christensen. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard from her at all since the fire began, and that\u2019s not like her.\u201d\n\n7:56 PM:\n\n7:55 PM:\n\nToday this beautiful bridge was destroyed by the #campfire.

But beneath the headline numbers there are reasons to doubt that the index is signaling inflation.\n\nAbsent the volatile food and energy categories, prices of goods did not rise at all in October. And prices of many household goods, from appliances to toilet paper, actually fell.\n\nThe rise in the index was driven by the services category. But this doesn\u2019t mean the price of services went up because a big part of the gain was in a little-understood category called \u201ctrade services,\u201d the part of the index keyed around wholesale distributors and retailers.\n\nTrade services was one of the biggest gainers in the services category for October. Unlike the other categories in the producer price index, which measure changes in prices received by establishments for the sale of goods produced or services provided, the gauge for the trade services sector measures the margins received by retailers and wholesalers.\n\nThis means that a rise in trade services components of the index does not necessarily indicate rising prices. If shops selling a can of soup for $1.00 paid 90 cents for soup in September and 89 cents in October, the retailer\u2019s margin will have grown from 10 cents to 11 cents. Since trade services is a measure of margin changes, this would show up as a 10 percent gain\u2013even though the relevant price fell.\n\nRetail trade services, the margin for stores selling directly to consumers, rose 2.8 percent in October compared with the prior month. For the year, this gauge is up 1.0 percent. Wholesale trade services, the margin for distributors who sell products to the consumer-facing retailers, was up 1.4 percent for the month and was up 3.0 percent compared to a year ago.\n\nThe other big mover in the services category was advertising. Prices for ads were up 3.6 percent for October, which may reflect the high levels of spending by Republicans and Democrats in the midterm elections. Compared with a year ago, however, this category was flat.\n\nInsurance companies\u2019 prices rose 1.8 percent and are up 8.4 percent compared with a year ago. Transportation services rose 0.9 percent, which likely reflects shipping companies passing on some of their rising costs due to rising wages for truckers. Compared with the year ago, this category is up 5.5 percent.\n\nPrices for \u201caccommodation services,\u201d meaning hotels and motels, were up 3.6 percent for the month. For the year, these were up 4.1 percent.\n\nSoftware publishers got a boost, with their prices rising 0.8 percent in October. Software prices, however, have lagged prices across the broader economy. For the year, they are up just 0.4 percent.\n\nMost other services prices were unchanged or down for the month.\n\nNext week, when the government releases data on consumer prices, we will see definitively whether or not the hot producer-price index was a forewarning about inflation or just a sign that retailers and wholesalers had a good month,", "Leading military and political figures have condemned the Tory government\u2019s decision to exclude Rhodesian veterans from services commemorating the centenary of the First World War while inviting Germany to participate.\n\nRhodesia and its predecessor states sent thousands of men to fight for the United Kingdom during the world wars, losing one in ten of its men during the Great War, according to The Telegraph.\n\nThe self-governing colony had a terrific falling out with the mother country during decolonisation, however, when the UK insisted it should move to a one person, one vote system.\n\nRhodesia did not restrict the franchise to white people at the time, mandating only certain property and income requirements, like many democratic countries in the early part of the 20th century \u2014 although, in practice, this meant that its legislature was dominated by the white minority.\n\nThe colony\u2019s government claimed a leap to universal suffrage would have dire consequences in a land with relatively low literacy rates and riven by tribal enmities, particularly with the Communist powers in Eurasia infiltrating native political movements in order to ensure it would move out of the Western sphere of influence after independence.\n\nThe British government believed the Rhodesians were only objecting to maintain their ad hoc racial privileges, however, and would not compromise \u2014 leading to a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) under the leadership of Battle of Britain veteran Ian Smith in 1965.\n\nUDI led to Rhodesia being barred from attending Remembrance ceremonies; a state of affairs which only came to an end when the long Bush War against Communist-backed African guerrillas concluded with the country caving to British demands, crippled by economic sanctions, in 1980.\n\nThey were excluded again, however, when the government of Zimbabwe \u2014 as Rhodesia\u2019s post-decolonisation successor was named \u2014 took a turn for the tyrannical under Robert Mugabe, a former terrorist who conducted a long campaign of violence and persecution against his political rivals, tribal enemies, and the white minority over almost four decades in power.\n\nMy article in @Telegraph on why Rhodesians should again be allowed to\n\nlay a wreath at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday #LestWeForget pic.twitter.com/GN68VpliX1 \u2014 Lord Ashcroft (@LordAshcroft) November 1, 2018\n\nRhodesian veterans and their families, as well as Zimbabwean officials, are still excluded from Remembrance ceremonies today \u2014 a point of considerable contention as the centenary of the end of the Great War on November 11th looms.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the politics, soldiers from southern Rhodesia who fought in the First and Second World Wars should be recognised along with everybody else from the Empire and former colonies,\u201d commented General Sir Lord Dannatt, the former head of the Army, urging Theresa May\u2019s government to reconsider its decision.\n\n\u201cThe Rhodesian contribution to both wars was completely disproportionate, they showed immense bravery,\u201d added Julian Brazier, a former defence minister.\n\n\u201cI think we need to recognise also that they were Rhodesians of all colours, including the African Rifles, and that they served in the ancillary services and the SAS. I think it is well overdue that they are readmitted.\u201d\n\nMichael Ashcroft, an influential Tory donor and member of the House of Lords noted for his work to collect and preserve Victoria Crosses and the stories of those who won them, was particularly scathing of the Rhodesians\u2019 exclusion, pointing out that even the Germans have been invited to participate in the centennial commemorations.\n\n\u201cIn the spirit of reconciliation which is, quite rightly, being advocated to mark the centenary of the end of the Great War, shouldn\u2019t we be inviting our former allies to join us at the Cenotaph?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cAfter all, we are expected to forgive former IRA political leaders who ordered the murder of British servicemen and innocent civilians.\u201d\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "A measure of U.S. business prices rose in October at the fastest pace in nearly six years, driven in part by expanding margins at retailers and wholesalers.\n\nMany economists have been predicting that rising U.S. tariffs would drive prices higher for U.S. consumers, with some describing tariffs as a \u201ctax on consumers.\u201d The producer-price data suggest that while some businesses are paying higher prices for certain materials, they are are not passing those price hikes on to consumers.\n\nThe producer-price index, which mostly measures the prices businesses receive for their goods and services, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent in October from a month earlier, the Labor Department said Friday. That is the largest monthly increase since September 2012 and double what economists had forecast.\n\nFrom a year earlier, the producer-price index increased 2.9 percent in October. That was up from September\u2019s read of a 2.6 percent annual gain.\n\nThe rise of the index was driven by a gain in the gauge\u2019s measure of services. This was up 0.7 percent, the biggest one-month increase since the beginning of 2016. Much of that was due to larger mark-ups by retailers and wholesalers, which do not necessarily mean prices are rising.\n\nPrices for goods, less volatile food and energy categories, were unchanged for the month. This is the broadest category where tariffs would show up if they were to hit consumers.\n\nTariffs have raised prices for businesses further out on the production chain but these are not filtering through to consumers, according to the data. There is very little evidence in the latest producer-price index that tariffs are acting as a tax on consumers\u2013and plenty that they are not.\n\nThe prices of steel mill products, for example, are up 18.4 percent compared with a year ago, thanks to the steel tariffs. (Note, however, steel mill prices actually fell in October after being flat a month earlier, suggesting that the market is adapting by ramping up domestic supply.)\n\nBut the prices of stuff made of steel and sold to consumers are barely up at all. Auto parts are up 1.3 percent compared with a year ago. Car prices are up just 0.5 percent for the year. Prices of \u201clight trucks\u201d\u2013SUVs and pickup trucks\u2013are up 1.6 percent. Prices of both fell in October compared with September.\n\nPrices of materials used to make durable goods fell in October by 0.3 percent but are up a whopping 7.9 percent year-over-year, likely driven higher by both steel and aluminum tariffs. But the prices of the durable goods themselves are up just 2.0 percent for the year and fell by 0.2 percent in October. The tariffs have raised costs but most of that gets absorbed by the manufacturers rather than passed on to consumers.\n\nPrices of home appliances are up 3.3 percent compared with a year ago but fell in October. It\u2019s likely that most of this rise is not due to the steel and aluminum tariffs. Instead, the category was pushed up by the double-digit rise in the price of washing machines, which have an anti-dumping tariff of there very own that was intended to raise prices. Even here, the price hikes of appliances are somewhat offset by a 0.6 percent decline in home electronic equipment and a fall in the price of detergents.\n\nThis highlights the fact that when tariffs do raise prices of some consumer goods, other prices typically fall as consumer spending shifts rather than rises.\n\nThe China tariffs, which now cover $250 billion of Made in China goods, are also not raising prices significantly. Take apparel, one area where a lot of analysts said tariffs were likely to \u201cpinch consumers.\u201d Women\u2019s clothing prices rose by 0.1 percent in October, up 0.4 percent from a year ago. Mens clothing is up 0.2 percent for the month and 0.7 percent compared with a year ago. Footwear prices rose just 0.2 percent in October and are up 0.4 percent for the year.\n\nComputer prices rose 0.4 percent in October and are up 0.4 percent for the year, rebounding from a 0.4 percent decline in September.\n\nToys and sports equipment make up one of the largest categories of stuff imported from China, amounting to $26 billion last year. Toy prices were unchanged for the month and are up just 1.9 percent for the year. Sports equipment prices rose by 0.1 percent and are up less than 1 percent for the year.\n\nThe one category where tariffs may be behind rising prices is furniture. The U.S. imported $32 billion of furniture from China last year and this category got hit with new tariffs at the end of September. In October, furniture prices rose 1.1 percent, a pretty big move in a single month. These are up 3.4 percent year over year. Margins for furniture retailers and wholesalers also declined, which also points to tariffs hiking prices.\n\nThis is not necessarily inflationary. Further data will have to show whether prices in furniture will continue to climb or if this is a one-time move higher. Steel and aluminum have shown that prices can actually retreat after the initial post-tariff hike. And keep in mind that as households had to pay more for furniture in October, they paid less for appliances, electronics, cars, trucks, soaps, and even toilet paper. This is another demonstration of the fact that tariffs do not raise prices generally, they shift them around.\n\nThe producer-price index usually follows the same trends as other measures of inflation, such as the consumer price index. But the different gauges do not always line up exactly. Next week the government is set to release CPI data for October.", "An Education Week analysis of midterm election data finds that of the 177 teachers who ran for office in their state legislatures during the midterms, only 42 were elected.\n\nAccording to the education media outlet, teachers were spurred to run for public office as a result of the teacher walkouts that protested teacher pay and funding for public schools.\n\nThe report states:\n\nIt was the culmination of months, if not years, of activism and advocacy for many of these educators, and yet the victory wasn\u2019t clear-cut. While 42 teachers won, nearly 80 teachers\u2014or two-thirds of those on the ballot\u2014lost their legislative bids in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, according to an Education Week analysis. And gubernatorial candidates who pushed for pumping more money into public schools were also defeated in Oklahoma and Arizona, leaving teachers there reeling.\n\n\u201cIt could have cohered into a clear story\u2014a wave story\u2014but in fact, it\u2019s more of a patchwork,\u201d said Jeffrey Henig, the director of the politics and education program at Teachers College at Columbia University. \u201cThis will be disappointing to some folks who were very excited and envisioned a teacher wave.\u201d\n\nOf the 42 teachers who were elected to their state legislatures, 33 are Democrats, and 9 are Republicans.\n\nMany of the teacher walkouts earlier this year were led by teachers entrenched in the radical philosophies that aim to develop Marxism in schools. National teacher union leaders promoted these walkouts and attempted to relate them to gun violence in schools.\n\nIn Arizona, for example, Noah Karvelis led the teachers\u2019 movement known as #RedForEd. He tweeted last December that \u201cteaching is political\u201d:\n\nThings more educators should discuss (especially if they work with young (white) men) in the classroom in 2018: 1. Gender, Feminism, & #MeToo\n\n2. Race\n\n3.

For example, illegal migrants will have to show they have a \u201creasonable fear\u201d of persecution if they are refused entry, not merely an easy-to-pass \u201ccredible fear\u201d test. In fiscal 2018, almost 400,000 migrants were caught crossing the border.\n\nThe policy does not fix other border problems, such as the easy-asylum rules set by Congress for people who apply at the formal \u201cports of entry\u201d along the border. Many of the caravan migrants \u2014 especially those bringing children \u2014 are expected to apply for full asylum at the ports of entry.\n\nThis morning, President Trump took action to ensure asylum claims are not a free pass to cross our borders illegally without consequence. https://t.co/HGeOLHsxGR pic.twitter.com/ljvxNdwBH6 \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) November 9, 2018\n\nIn the preamble to the proclamation, Trump said:\n\nThe United States has a long and proud history of offering protection to aliens who are fleeing persecution and torture and who qualify under the standards articulated in our immigration laws, including through our asylum system and the Refugee Admissions Program. But our system is being overwhelmed by migration through our southern border. Crossing the border to avoid detection and then, if apprehended, claiming a fear of persecution is in too many instances an avenue to near-automatic release into the interior of the United States. Once released, such aliens are very difficult to remove.\n\nThe new proclamation-and-withholding package is part of a larger strategy which uses a series of regulatory changes to gradually shrink the border-wall loopholes which are being held open by pro-migration Democrats and business-first Republicans in Congress.\n\nFor example, officials are pushing forward with a plan to close the 2015 Flores loophole which allows economic migrants who bring children to be released into the U.S. job market after just 20 days of detection \u2014 or well before officials can complete the 40-day asylum-adjudication process.\n\nTrump has also said he expects to build \u201ctent cities\u201d on the border. The likely purpose it to prevent the release of migrants into the labor market while officials quickly process and deport economic migrants.\n\nAG Sessions has raised the bar for passing the credible fear tests and getting a judicial approval of an asylum request.\n\nAt the border, officials are also forcing migrants to wait in Mexico as border officials process a reasonable number of claims each day. This process, dubbed \u201cmetering,\u201d prevents a rush of migrants from overwhelming the border process and then triggering the catch-and-release process. The metering process also keeps migrants in Mexico, so preventing them from filing lawsuits in U.S. courts to bypass border safeguards. The process also allows border stations to conduct normal procedures, such as checking visitors and trucks for potential crimes, such as drug smuggling.\n\nAll of these policies threaten the labor-trafficking cartels because they may make migration economically unaffordable to poor migrants. In contrast, the current catch-and-release rules allow migrants to walk through the border barriers and into U.S jobs, so providing cheap labor for U.S businesses, cheap services for wealthy Americans and lucrative smuggling payments back to the cartels.\n\nPresident Trump: \"I just signed the proclamation on asylum. Very important. People can come in, but they have to come in through the ports of entry.\" pic.twitter.com/PCyj2CeGZ9 \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) November 9, 2018\n\nThe cartels are expected to change their labor-trafficking strategies in response t Trump\u2019s proclamation.\n\nThe quickest response is expected from pro-migration legal groups in the United States, such as the ACLU. For example, the caravan migrants are heading to the California border, ensuring their legal claims will be reviewed by the very pro-migration judges in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. In contrast, migrants who cross the Texas border have their claims heard by 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nFACT: US law specifically allows individuals to apply for asylum whether or not they are at a port of entry. It is illegal to circumvent that \u2014 by agency or presidential decree. https://t.co/vVRdFEQ1qX \u2014 ACLU (@ACLU) November 8, 2018\n\nCongress is also expected to react by minimizing Trump\u2019s funding for border enforcement. For example, the GOP-controlled House and Senate have already rejected administration requests to fund 50,000 detention spaces for migrants. The House and Senate have also rejected requests for extra funding to hire more border guards and enforcement agents.\n\nBusiness-first and pro-migration legislators may unite this December to pressure Trump into accepting a swap that gives him a no-reform border-wall in exchange for a no-strings DACA-plus amnesty.\n\nAlso, Congress may use the lame-duck session in December to use the funding bill to sneak more loopholes into the border laws. For example, in July, Kansas Rep. Kevin Yoder added a measure to the 2019 spending plan that would indirectly enforce catch-and-release rules by barring border officials from sheltering children is different locations from detained parents. The plan is unlikely to be included in any final law, in part, because Yoder lost his election campaign.\n\nThe proclamation includes a long preamble where Trump makes his political and legal case in support of the new rules:\n\nThe United States expects the arrival at the border between the United States and Mexico (southern border) of a substantial number of aliens primarily from Central America who appear to have no lawful basis for admission into our country. They are traveling in large, organized groups through Mexico and reportedly intend to enter the United States unlawfully or without proper documentation and to seek asylum, despite the fact that, based on past experience, a significant majority will not be eligible for or be granted that benefit. Many entered Mexico unlawfully \u2014 some with violence \u2014 and have rejected opportunities to apply for asylum and benefits in Mexico. The arrival of large numbers of aliens will contribute to the overloading of our immigration and asylum system and to the release of thousands of aliens into the interior of the United States. The continuing and threatened mass migration of aliens with no basis for admission into the United States through our southern border has precipitated a crisis and undermines the integrity of our borders. I therefore must take immediate action to protect the national interest, and to maintain the effectiveness of the asylum system for legitimate asylum seekers who demonstrate that they have fled persecution and warrant the many special benefits associated with asylum. In recent weeks, an average of approximately 2,000 inadmissible aliens have entered each day at our southern border. In Fiscal Year 2018 overall, 124,511 aliens were found inadmissible at ports of entry on the southern border, while 396,579 aliens were apprehended entering the United States unlawfully between such ports of entry. The great number of aliens who cross unlawfully into the United States through the southern border consumes tremendous resources as the Government seeks to surveil, apprehend, screen, process, and detain them. Aliens who enter the United States unlawfully or without proper documentation and are subject to expedited removal may avoid being promptly removed by demonstrating, during an initial screening process, a credible fear of persecution or torture. Approximately 2 decades ago, most aliens deemed inadmissible at a port of entry or apprehended after unlawfully entering the United States through the southern border were single adults who were promptly returned to Mexico, and very few asserted a fear of return. Since then, however, there has been a massive increase in fear-of-persecution or torture claims by aliens who enter the United States through the southern border. The vast majority of such aliens are found to satisfy the credible-fear threshold, although only a fraction of the claimants whose claims are adjudicated ultimately qualify for asylum or other protection. Aliens found to have a credible fear are often released into the interior of the United States, as a result of a lack of detention space and a variety of other legal and practical difficulties, pending adjudication of their claims in a full removal proceeding in immigration court. The immigration adjudication process often takes years to complete because of the growing volume of claims and because of the need to expedite proceedings for detained aliens. During that time, many released aliens fail to appear for hearings, do not comply with subsequent orders of removal, or are difficult to locate and remove. Members of family units pose particular challenges. The Federal Government lacks sufficient facilities to house families together. Virtually all members of family units who enter the United States through the southern border, unlawfully or without proper documentation, and that are found to have a credible fear of persecution, are thus released into the United States. Against this backdrop of near-assurance of release, the number of such aliens traveling as family units who enter through the southern border and claim a credible fear of persecution has greatly increased. And large numbers of family units decide to make the dangerous and unlawful border crossing with their children. The United States has a long and proud history of offering protection to aliens who are fleeing persecution and torture and who qualify under the standards articulated in our immigration laws, including through our asylum system and the Refugee Admissions Program. But our system is being overwhelmed by migration through our southern border. Crossing the border to avoid detection and then, if apprehended, claiming a fear of persecution is in too many instances an avenue to near-automatic release into the interior of the United States. Once released, such aliens are very difficult to remove. An additional influx of large groups of aliens arriving at once through the southern border would add tremendous strain to an already taxed system, especially if they avoid orderly processing by unlawfully crossing the southern border. The entry of large numbers of aliens into the United States unlawfully between ports of entry on the southern border is contrary to the national interest, and our law has long recognized that aliens who seek to lawfully enter the United States must do so at ports of entry. Unlawful entry puts lives of both law enforcement and aliens at risk. By contrast, entry at ports of entry at the southern border allows for orderly processing, which enables the efficient deployment of law enforcement resources across our vast southern border. Failing to take immediate action to stem the mass migration the United States is currently experiencing and anticipating would only encourage additional mass unlawful migration and further overwhelming of the system. Other presidents have taken strong action to prevent mass migration. In Proclamation 4865 of September 29, 1981 (High Seas Interdiction of Illegal Aliens), in response to an influx of Haitian nationals traveling to the United States by sea, President Reagan suspended the entry of undocumented aliens from the high seas and ordered the Coast Guard to intercept such aliens before they reached United States shores and to return them to their point of origin. In Executive Order 12807 of May 24, 1992 (Interdiction of Illegal Aliens), in response to a dramatic increase in the unlawful mass migration of Haitian nationals to the United States, President Bush ordered additional measures to interdict such Haitian nationals and return them to their home country. The Supreme Court upheld the legality of those measures in Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc., 509 U.S. 155 (1993). I am similarly acting to suspend, for a limited period, the entry of certain aliens in order to address the problem of large numbers of aliens traveling through Mexico to enter our country unlawfully or without proper documentation. I am tailoring the suspension to channel these aliens to ports of entry, so that, if they enter the United States, they do so in an orderly and controlled manner instead of unlawfully. Under this suspension, aliens entering through the southern border, even those without proper documentation, may, consistent with this proclamation, avail themselves of our asylum system, provided that they properly present themselves for inspection at a port of entry. In anticipation of a large group of aliens arriving in the coming weeks, I am directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to commit additional resources to support our ports of entry at the southern border to assist in processing those aliens \u2014 and all others arriving at our ports of entry \u2014 as efficiently as possible. But aliens who enter the United States unlawfully through the southern border in contravention of this proclamation will be ineligible to be granted asylum under the regulation promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security that became effective earlier today. Those aliens may, however, still seek other forms of protection from persecution or torture. In addition, this limited suspension will facilitate ongoing negotiations with Mexico and other countries regarding appropriate cooperative arrangements to prevent unlawful mass migration to the United States through the southern border. Thus, this proclamation is also necessary to manage and conduct the foreign affairs of the United States effectively.\n\nThe formal presidential announcement says:\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), respectively) hereby find that, absent the measures set forth in this proclamation, the entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions.

(a) The suspension and limitation on entry pursuant to section 1 of this proclamation shall apply only to aliens who enter the United States after the date of this proclamation. (b) The suspension and limitation on entry pursuant to section 1 of this proclamation shall not apply to any alien who enters the United States at a port of entry and properly presents for inspection, or to any lawful permanent resident of the United States. \u2026 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this\n\nninth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eighteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-third.

That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees.", "Left-wing filmmaker Michael Moore claimed Friday morning that Republicans prevent African-Americans from voting because it is the only way they can win elections.\n\nReacting to a tweet via Mother Jones\u2019 Ari Berman, in which he accused Republicans of being \u201cterrified of free and fair elections,\u201d Michael Moore said: \u201cIt has to feel awful knowing that your side is outnumbered by the millions and the only way you can hang on to any power is to simply rig it/steal it/prevent black people from voting.

Rick Scott (R-FL) is alleging that elections officials in South Florida are trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election for Democrats as razor-thin margins raise the specter of recounts and court battles in the state\u2019s races for Senate and governor.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, Democrat Andrew Gillum\u2019s campaign said Thursday it\u2019s readying for a possible recount. The race has tightened since he conceded to Republican Ron DeSantis on Tuesday night. As of Thursday afternoon, DeSantis led Gillum by 0.47 percentage point.\n\nIncumbent Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) has begun preparing for a potential recount in a race still too close to call against Scott, who is leaving the governor\u2019s seat because of term limits. Nelson\u2019s lawyer called that race a \u201cjump ball.\u201d Scott\u2019s campaign urged Nelson to concede. Scott held a 0.21 percentage lead over Nelson on Thursday afternoon.\n\nWith the passage of Florida\u2019s Amendment 4, close to 1.5 million former felons will not be able to vote. \u201cBlack people, who are disproportionately arrested and incarcerated, will benefit the most. In 2016, more than 418,000 black people out of a black voting-age population of more than 2.3 million, or 17.9 percent of potential black voters in Florida, had finished sentences but couldn\u2019t vote due to a felony record, according to the Sentencing Project,\u201d Vox reports. However, as the left-leaning news outlet points out, there is no way of knowing how the newly passed measure will impact future election outcomes. Further, Vox does not explicitly state Gillum would have won Florida\u2019s gubernatorial race had the measure been passed earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, Georgia\u2019s Democrat gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams refuses to concede to her Republican rival Brian Kemp.\n\nKemp resigned Thursday as Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, removing himself from the ongoing count of the governor\u2019s election he says he\u2019s already won.\n\nKemp made his announcement in the governor\u2019s office of the Georgia Capitol, standing beside the man he plans to replace in January. Republican Gov. Nathan Deal called Kemp \u201cthe governor-elect\u201d and both said they would begin transition work together.\n\n\u201cWe won a clear and convincing victory,\u201d Kemp said of returns showing him with 50.3 percent of almost 4 million votes, about a 63,000-vote lead over Democrat Stacey Abrams. That\u2019s a narrow sum considering the near-presidential election year turnout, though sufficient for the majority required for outright victory.\n\nWhile Moore\u2019s tweet makes no reference to the Georgia gubernatorial race, Kemp is accused of placing a hold on approximately 37,100 African-American voter registration applications. The move comes as Kemp\u2019s former office is currently investigating the state\u2019s Democrat Party for possible cyber crimes.\n\nAbrams maintained there are enough uncounted ballots to force a December runoff in one of the marquee matchups of the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nWith legal wrangles opening on what votes to count and how, the dispute is prolonging a bitter contest awash in historical significance and national political impact. Abrams hopes to become the first black woman elected governor of any American state. Kemp seeks to maintain Republican dominance in a growing, diversifying Deep South state positioned to become a presidential battleground.\n\nThe key question is how many uncounted ballots actually remain. Kemp says it\u2019s less than 21,000 \u2014 almost certainly not enough to force a runoff. The elections chief from the secretary of state\u2019s office said in a federal court hearing Thursday afternoon that the number is 21,190.\n\n\u201cEven if she got 100 percent of those votes, we still win,\u201d Kemp told reporters.\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign argues the total could be higher, and the secretary of state\u2019s office has been scant in sharing details as officials in Georgia\u2019s 159 counties keep counting.\n\n\u201cThis is about the integrity of the election in the state of Georgia,\u201d said Abrams\u2019 campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo. \u201cBrian Kemp can\u2019t just walk away from that \u2026 Our governor (Deal) can\u2019t just walk away from that.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "President Donald Trump-hating comedian George Lopez has been charged over an altercation caught on tape at a Hooters last month, TMZ reports.\n\nThe aging comedian will have to appear in court next month after being charged with misdemeanor battery.\n\n\u201cAccording to the police report,\u201d TMZ reports, \u201ccops tracked George down the next day at a golf course and asked for his side of the story.

Carlson himself seems perplexed by the white nationalist label; on his show last year, he said he didn\u2019t \u201ceven know what \u2018white nationalist\u2019 means.\u201d\n\nA little over two weeks later, on October 16, the assault on Carlson began in earnest when CNN accused Carlson of \u201claying the groundwork for an authoritarian agenda.\u201d\n\n[T]he GOP is taking another step toward abandoning democracy altogether, and laying the ideological groundwork for an authoritarian agenda, no matter who wins in November\u2019s midterms. \u2026 Right-wing Fox television personality Tucker Carlson also characterized people chanting in a restaurant to protest Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as a \u201cmob.\u201d In response to Eric Holder quipping that when Republicans go low, Democrats should \u201ckick them,\u201d Carlson warned darkly that Democrats would soon take up shooting and burning.\n\nThree days later, on October 19, CNN attacked Carlson as \u201canti-immigration\u201d:\n\nI channel-surfed on Thursday night. Fox\u2019s Tucker Carlson led his 8 p.m. hour with an anti-immigration spiel, with banners that read \u201cMASSIVE MIGRANT CARAVAN ON THE WAY,\u201d \u201cMIGRANT CARAVAN KEEPS GROWING,\u201d and \u201c4,000 CENTRAL AMERICANS MARCH TO US BORDER.\u201d\n\nA week later, CNN openly blamed Carlson (among others on the political right) for a string of pipe bombs mailed out to prominent left-wingers last month.\n\n\u201cWords matter. And here\u2019s one way to gauge their impact,\u201d CNN writes before naming the people targeted.\n\n\u201cWhat do the targets have in common?\u201d CNN asks.\n\nThe answer: \u201cThey\u2019ve all been targeted by President Donald Trump and made into bogeymen for the far-right, often on Fox News by opinion anchors like Sean Hannity.\u201d\n\nCNN helpfully points out that Carlson has mentioned Hillary Clinton (one of the pipe bomb targets) \u201cmore than 290 times\u201d since Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nA mere three days later, on October 30, the smear campaign against Carlson went into hyper-drive. In a piece titled \u201cPittsburgh suspect echoed talking point that dominated Fox News airwaves,\u201d the left-wing outlet \u2014 without evidence \u2014 openly ties the monster who shot up a synagogue in Pittsburgh last month to Fox News and Carlson, specifically:\n\nIn the search for answers after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, there is newfound scrutiny on the suspect\u2019s social media posts and how his anti-Semitism merged with a hatred of immigrants. The suspect [name redacted] complained about immigrant \u201cinvaders\u201d six days before the shooting. \u2026 It may never be known where he heard this hateful language. But a review of television and online content shows how \u201cinvasion\u201d and \u201cinvaders\u201d became a talking point in October \u2014 not just in the darkest corners of the web, but on Fox\u2019s prime time shows. \u2026 Within days of the new caravan\u2019s formation in Honduras, Fox News hosts and Republican congressmen were using dehumanizing language and casting the migrants as an imminent threat. \u2026 Fox\u2019s Tucker Carlson referenced an \u201cinvasion\u201d as early as October 16.\n\nThe following day, on October 30, CNN again attempted to tie Trump\u2019s talk about the migrant caravan to the shooter. And nowhere does the piece mention that this monster despised Trump, specifically for the president\u2019s openly pro-Jewish and pro-Israel beliefs and policies.\n\nAnd again, without a shred of evidence, the piece ties Carlson\u2019s coverage of the caravan to the overall theme that this coverage inspired the Pittsburgh massacre:\n\n[Trump\u2019s] talking about a migrant \u201cinvasion\u201d at the southern border while authorities examine the Pittsburgh shooter\u2019s hatred of \u201cinvaders\u201d and Jews.\n\n\u2026\n\nOn MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAll In,\u201d Michelle Goldberg said, \u201cTrump has not only created this big lie about the caravan that has inspired mass murder, but he is now shifting the resources of government to instantiate his lie.\u201d At the same time on Fox, Tucker Carlson reassured his viewers that \u201cthe migrant caravan is a real thing\u2026\u201d\n\nTwo days later, on November 1, Carlson is named by CNN as an enabler of racism in a piece titled, \u201cTrump\u2019s racist video is part of a broader GOP midterm strategy aimed at the conservative base.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that the above is only what CNN has written about Carlson. Articles of this kind are usually promoted endlessly on CNN\u2019s airwaves and through endless segments of partisan commentary (e.g., the video embedded at the top here) \u2014 not to mention social media:\n\nTucker Carlson slamming media/politicians on immigration crisis claiming, \"No matter what they tell you this isn't about helping children \u2026. They're goal is to change your country forever.\" \u2014 Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) June 19, 2018\n\nTucker Carlson is doing what he often does: suggesting politicians and media care more about the children of \"foreign nationals\" who enter US illegally than they do about American children. \u2014 Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) June 19, 2018\n\nWhat\u2019s more, in recent weeks, the anti-Trump channel has accused Carlson of ginning up hate, has devoted an entire primetime segment to attacking Carlson as a racist, as no different from the southern racists who used \u201cbullhorns and water hoses,\u201d as part of a \u201cvein of white nationalism.\u201d\n\nIn July, a CNN headline had already declared Tucker a racist.\n\nEven in CNN\u2019s coverage of the Antifa attack on Carlson\u2019s wife and home, he is attacked as a \u201cwhite supremacist.\u201d\n\nThe piece says, \u201cCarlson, one of the top hosts on Fox, is a top target of progressive critics. They say Carlson supports white supremacy through his commentaries and programming choices \u2014 a charge he flatly denies.\u201d\n\nAbove all, though, CNN has been a longtime apologist for Antifa and has openly supported the harassment of people on the political right.\n\nWhen Smash Racism DC (the very same Antifa group that terrorized Carlson\u2019s wife) mobbed Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and his wife in a Washington DC restaurant six weeks ago, CNN\u2019s Don Lemon said, \u201cIt goes with the territory \u2026 that\u2019s what he signed up for. That\u2019s part of the deal.\u201d\n\nOver the summer, CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo launched a vigorous defense of the left-wing terrorist group Antifa and their use of violence.\n\n\u201cThe bigots are wrong to hit. Antifa \u2026 are also wrong to hit,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cBut fighting hate is right. And in a clash between hate and those who oppose it, those who oppose it are on the side of right.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThat\u2019s why people who show up to fight against bigots are not to be judged the same as the bigots, even if they do resort to the same kinds of petty violence.\u201d\n\nAnd then, a mere six weeks later, CNN launched a vigorous campaign to tar Carlson as a bigot, as a racist \u2026 as someone who it is \u201cright\u201d for Antifa to \u201cfight.\u201d\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

It appears that the indictment has come as a result of an FBI investigation into Tesla.\n\nParulekar has been charged with taking part in a scheme which involved diverting company payments, falsifying invoices, the impersonation of an employee working at one of Tesla\u2019s suppliers and identity theft. Details of these charges come from the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California who said in a statement:\n\nAccording to the indictment, Parulekar learned in January 2017 that Tesla had terminated its supplier relationship with Schwabische Huttenwerke Automotive GmbH (\u201cSHW\u201d). At the time of the termination, SHW had only provided a limited number of sample products, specifically, motor pumps, to Tesla. Parulekar allegedly knew the termination meant that Tesla was withholding future payments to SHW and that Parulekar was not authorized to contravene this decision. Notwithstanding these facts, Parulekar redirected a series of payments intended for another supplier, Hota Industrial Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (\u201cHota\u201d), and caused them to be paid to SHW.\n\nThe former Tesla employee is being charged with nine counts of wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft with each count of wire fraud carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine according to the Department of Justice. Parulekar could also be facing up to two years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the charge of aggravated identity theft.\n\nThis case is not related to the ongoing FBI investigation of Tesla, which focuses on determining if the company\u2019s production figures were fraudulently manipulated.\n\nTesla has so far declined to comment on the case.", "President Donald Trump responded Friday to the news that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was recently hospitalized.\n\n\u201cI wish her well,\u201d Trump said to reporters who asked if he was thinking about another Supreme Court pick after the news broke.\n\nGinsburg was hospitalized after falling in her office and breaking three ribs.\n\nTrump said he is not thinking about a replacement for Ginsburg but that he hopes she will return to health.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say she\u2019s exactly on my side, but I hope she gets better, and I hope she serves on the Supreme Court for many, many years,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Trump recalled that Ginsburg made an \u201cinappropriate\u201d comment about him during the 2016 election, a comment for which she later apologized.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what this place would be \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine what the country would be \u2014 with Donald Trump as our president,\u201d Ginsburg said in July 2016. \u201cFor the country, it could be four years.

To open the event, the president spoke about his desire to work with Democrats and to cool the campaign rhetoric.\n\nAcosta, however, only wanted to keep things ugly.\n\nEarly in the presser, Trump called on Acosta.

The migrant caravan is \u201cnot an invasion,\u201d he lectured.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hundreds and hundreds of miles away, they\u2019re not an invasion,\u201d he said in a forum where the media is supposed to ask the president questions, not make speeches.\n\nStill, Trump responded; and Acosta argued with him again. Trump responded again; Acosta kept arguing.\n\nBy all modern norms, this should have been the end of it. One question, one follow-up, and then you step aside to give your colleagues the opportunity to ask a question.\n\nBut Acosta wanted a third question and then a fourth. He wanted to shame, lecture, and debate the president.\n\nThings got especially ugly when Acosta got physical with a much smaller, female intern who was just doing her job. Asked by her boss, no less than the president of the United States, to give the microphone to another reporter, assuming he would, she reached for it, and Acosta responded by twice whacking her arm. He probably would have continued hitting her had she not given up.\n\nTo make matters worse, CNN and Acosta then proceeded to not only lie about Acosta not touching the intern, the far-left network falsely claimed the White House had \u201cdoctored\u201d video it released that conclusively proved Acosta had gotten physical with the young woman.\n\nAnd so, Acosta loss his press pass and despite his objectively unprofessional behavior and physical aggressiveness, the establishment media rallied around Acosta \u2014 even though he eats up their time to question the president, even though he makes them all look bad as he forces them to huddle together like a demented cult and defend the indefensible.\n\nTwo members of the establishment media, though, do deserve credit for breaking ranks, beginning with the BBC\u2019s Emily Maitlis, who took Acosta to task for his appalling behavior.\n\nEven the title of her piece \u2014 \u201cThe Acosta affair: An unpopular opinion\u201d \u2014 acknowledges that calling Acosta out is the \u201cunpopular\u201d thing to do in the media cult; and while she does not defend the White House revoking Acosta\u2019s press pass, she tells a truth all the media should be telling about this rude, unprofessional heckler:\n\nJim Acosta was called on by the president to ask a question. I\u2019ll say that again. He was called on by Donald Trump to ask whatever question he liked. And when he\u2019d finished asking one, he then asked another \u2013 with interruption follow-ups in between. It was only when he attempted his third question \u2013 or possibly fourth depending on how you define the follow-ups \u2013 that the president got angry and asked him to sit down. \u2026 What happened in that room was not the ultimate fight for press freedom. This wasn\u2019t someone risking life and limb against a regime where freedom of speech is forbidden. This was a bloke sitting in a room full of colleagues who were all trying to ask questions too. This was a man who\u2019d had his turn and had been told he couldn\u2019t hog the whole time. \u2026 The president took CNN\u2019s question and then took more. And when he tried to move on, he couldn\u2019t. Once the Acosta incident was over, he went on to take questions from journalists from all over the world \u2013 for a total of 90 minutes.\n\nOver at Poynter, Al Tompkins and Kelly McBride saw it pretty much the same way as they bored down on the fact that Acosta was not asking questions, he was making partisan, political statements:\n\nJim Acosta\u2019s encounter Wednesday at a White House press conference was less about asking questions and more about making statements. In doing so, the CNN White House reporter gave President Donald Trump room to critique Acosta\u2019s professionalism. \u2026 Acosta asked the president if Trump had demonized the caravan of Central Americans trekking toward the United States, ending his exchange by stating, \u201cIt is not an invasion.\u201d If Acosta had asked \u201cWhat about that seems like an invasion?\u201d he could have both sought an answer and avoided becoming bigger than the event he was covering. \u2026 If you look closely at the video, when Acosta was asking questions, his exchange with the president was on track and normal. Acosta asked. \u201cDo you think that you demonize immigrants?\u201d To which the president answered, \u201cNo.\u201d A better question might have been, \u201cHow do you respond to the criticism that you are demonizing certain types of immigrants, namely poor immigrants?\u201d But then Acosta\u2019s questions ended and his statements began. \u201cYour campaign had an ad showing migrants climbing over walls,\u201d he said. And then, \u201cThey are hundreds of miles away, that\u2019s not an invasion.\u201d The heated exchange grew from there. \u2026 A briefing is not the same as a cable news wrestling match, where sides shout at each other. Acosta should have handed over the microphone.\n\nWhat Acosta needs, for his own good and the good of the White House Press Corps, is the equivalent of a metaphorical blanket party. In the military, a screw-up making like hard for the rest of the platoon, gets covered in a blanket and roughed up. This is how a platoon disciplines itself.\n\nI am certainly not arguing for anyone to get physical with Acosta, but the concept still applies. If there are any adults left in the press corps (a dubious prospect), they need to take Acosta aside and tell him to knock it off. This can be done privately while still showing public solidarity. But if they care anything at all about their credibility with the public, that is what needs to be done.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

And it is worse than the fact that in accusing the president of responsibility for the most lethal antisemitic attack on U.S. soil in history, they seek to politicize Judaism and transform it into a political position.\n\nThe truly unsettling aspect of some of these groups\u2019 slanders of President Trump is that they themselves work to legitimize and advance the fortunes of antisemitic terrorists who murder Jews.\n\nJ Street, for instance has been a leading voice accusing Trump of responsibility for the massacre in Pittsburgh. Two days after the attack, J Street, which bills itself as \u201cpro-Israel and pro-peace,\u201d sent out an email about the event to its supporters. J Street President Jeremy Ben-Ami opened the letter with a nice call to \u201ccome together in support of the victims, their loved ones, the congregation and the entire city of Pittsburgh,\u201d and \u201cto grieve and comfort one another, standing together in solidarity.\u201d\n\nBut then he turned to the real business at hand. Ben-Ami insisted that the gunman, Robert Bowers, was \u201cmotivated in part\u201d by \u201cby anti-immigrant, antisemitic thought that has been spread not only by far-right groups, but by President Trump and some of his allies in the Republican party.\u201d\n\nBen-Ami provided no evidence for his incendiary claim. And he ignored the fact that Bowers had expressed hatred for Trump specifically due to the President\u2019s friendship and support for the Jewish people and Israel.\n\nHaving made his unsupported accusation, Ben-Ami proceeded to make a pitch for donations for J Street and for Democratic candidates supported by J Street.\n\nWhereas there is no evidence that Trump has incited or empowered or otherwise engaged in actions that provided any support for Bowers, there is direct evidence that Ben-Ami and his organization have tolerated antisemitic mass murderers.\n\nJust a week-and-a-half before the massacre in Pittsburgh, on October 17, Ben-Ami and the senior J Street leadership met with and expressed support for the leaders of the Palestinian Authority (PA) in Ramallah. Among those they met was the PA\u2019s Minister of Civil Affairs, Hussein al-Sheikh.\n\nAs Stephen Flatow reported, before assuming his current position, al-Sheikh was a senior terror commander for the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade of Fatah, the PA\u2019s ruling faction, headed by Mahmoud Abbas. In the framework of his duties, al-Sheikh paid for and provided arms to terrorists who used the money and the arms he provided to murder and maim Jews \u2013 including American Jews.\n\nOn March 21, 2002, a Palestinian suicide bomber from the Aksa Martyr Brigades detonated in downtown Jerusalem. Three people were killed in the blast, including Tzippi Shemesh, who was five months pregnant with twins. A hundred people were wounded. As Flatow relates, among the seriously wounded were U.S. citizen Alan Bauer and his seven-year-old son Jonathan. Bauer was hurled twenty feet by the force of the explosion.\n\n\u201cTwo screws that were packed into the bomb ripped clear through his left arm. \u2026 Jonathan suffered severe shrapnel wounds and fell into a coma. Jonathan subsequently underwent numerous operations to remove nails and screws from his head, including one that was lodged in his brain.\u201d\n\nThe Shemesh family sued the PA for damages in a Jerusalem District Court. Flatow reported that the court found in favor of the Shemesh family.\n\n\u201cIn its ruling,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe court cited closed-door testimony provided by Israeli intelligence officials who named names \u2013 including \u2018senior Fatah official Hussein al-Sheikh, who met the suicide bomber and two other operatives and gave them money and two hand grenades to carry out the bombing.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn other words, ten days before Bowers carried out his terror attack against Jews in Pittsburgh, Ben-Ami and his colleagues met with Hussein al-Sheikh, who is directly responsible for the antisemitic terrorist attacks that caused the murder of Israeli Jews and the maiming of American Jews.\n\nJ Street is not alone. There is also the New Israel Fund (NIF). The NIF is a radical leftist Jewish American group that supports non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Israel that work to undermine Israel\u2019s national identity as a Jewish state in multiple ways. Like Ben-Ami, following the massacre in Pittsburgh, NIF CEO Daniel Sokatch effectively blamed Trump for the Tree of Life massacre.\n\nIn a post at the Times of Israel website, Sokatch wrote, \u201cWe are all in shock right now. On some level, the American Jewish community has been bracing for something like this, expecting it for several years now. The hatred, xenophobia, and murderous supremacism that has infected the discourse and politics in our country these past few years \u2013 that now emanates right from the top, from the presidency itself \u2013 were like blinking red warning lights.\u201d\n\nSokatch\u2019s NIF has given millions of dollars to an Arab Israeli organization called Adalah. Adalah represents antisemitic terrorist murderers not unlike Bowers.\n\nAccording to a report by researcher Itai Reuveni, since at least 2001, Adalah has represented Palestinian terrorist murderers and their families before Israeli courts and the Israeli Supreme Court at least 14 times.\n\nFor instance, in 2001, Adalah represented Muhamed Zayid. Zayid is a member of the Hamas terror group. He was sentenced to life in prison for preparing the explosive belts used by suicide bombers to murder 17 Israelis and wound scores more.\n\nIn 2009, Adalah represented Walid Daka. Daka, an Israeli Arab citizen affiliated with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terror group, was involved in the 1984 kidnaping, torture and murder of Muhammed Tamam, an Israeli soldier.\n\nIn 2002, Adalah represented Palestinian terror mastermind Marwan Barghouti. In 2000, Barghouti set up the organizational structure of the Palestinian terror war. He led the Al-Aqsa Martyr Brigades and the Tanzim terror group. Barghouti is responsible for the murder of scores of Israeli Jews and the wounding of thousands more. In 2002, Israeli forces arrested him for murder. He was found guilty of multiple murders and sentenced to consecutive life sentences.\n\nIn July 2017, two Arab terrorists murdered two Israeli policemen on the Temple Mount. They were killed in the ensuing fire fight. Adalah represented their families before the Israeli Supreme Court demanding to receive the bodies of the dead antisemitic gunmen.\n\nSo, while claiming that Trump incited the Pittsburgh massacre by adopting and advocating policies that the NIF opposes, the NIF is financing the operations of Adalah, a group that represents terrorists who murder Israeli Jews.\n\nThe NIF is not alone in its support for Adalah. Democratic Congressman Hank Johnson of Georgia, who has referred to Israelis who live in communities in Judea and Samaria as \u201ctermites,\u201d and accused \u201cJewish people\u201d of stealing Palestinian land, met with Adalah employees at his Capitol Hill office in April. According to the Adalah website, in their briefings to progressive members of Congress, Adalah officials advocated for the destruction of Israel through the so-called \u201cright of return,\u201d which would bring millions of hostile, foreign-born Arabs to Israel.\n\nFollowing the massacre in Pittsburgh, Johnson suddenly opposed antisemitic terror. He participated in a memorial ceremony organized by his Jewish constituents in Georgia. He issued a statement calling for unity, declaring, \u201cWhen we are united, we can teach those who would be seduced by racism, by anti-Semitism, or by xenophobia, that hatred has no place in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe exploitation of the antisemitic mass murder of helpless elderly Jews in prayer for political gain is obscene in and of itself. When it is undertaken by organizations and politicians that themselves provide political cover to antisemitic mass murderers, or financial support to an organization that assists terrorists directly, it is especially galling.\n\nCaroline Glick is a world-renowned journalist and commentator on the Middle East and U.S. foreign policy, and the author of The Israeli Solution: A One-State Plan for Peace in the Middle East.

Antifa is a domestic terror group. I strongly believe that the FBI and the Department of Justice should classify them as such.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nKerik recalled, \u201cBack in the 60s, 70s, and 80s, we had to deal with the Weather Underground, the Black Panther Party, the Black Liberation Army, the Sam Melville\u2013Jonathan Jackson Unit. There were a number of these anti-American leftist communist socialist groups that were doing exactly what Antfa is doing today, and those groups were doing more, which is what I\u2019m afraid of. I\u2019m afraid this will escalate to much more severe violence. Back then, there were bombings [and] assassinations of police officers. It really got out of hand until the FBI classified these groups as domestic terror groups and started to go after them as such.\u201d\n\nKerik stated, \u201cI think the cities they operate in have to create local ordinances and laws that prevent them from being and remaining anonymous. They have a lot of courage when they have these masks on and nobody can see who they are or identify them. They wouldn\u2019t be standing out there if they didn\u2019t have the ability to remain anonymous.\u201d\n\nKerik remarked, \u201cI think the FBI and the Department of Justice should lock them up. Lock them up for violating people\u2019s civil rights. \u2026 They are trying to intimidate, harass, and threaten [Tucker Carlson] in an attempt to prevent him from doing his job as a member of the press.\u201d\n\nKerik called for investigating Antifa\u2019s funding and management.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re investigated, you\u2019re going to get to the financial root of this group,\u201d said Kerik. \u201cI\u2019d love to see who\u2019s paying these nitwits to stand out there in the middle of the night and yell and scream with a bullhorn. They\u2019re not doing it for nothing. They\u2019re not doing it because they just have nothing better to do and they all gathered in free spirit to stand around and act like idiots, and threaten people and scare the hell out of them. \u2026 They\u2019re doing it because they were paid.\u201d\n\nKerik continued, \u201cIf the FBI and [Justice Department] got into [Antifa\u2019s] background, started locking them up [and] interviewing them, somebody\u2019s going to flip, and somebody\u2019s going to tell you where they come from, where the money\u2019s coming from, who\u2019s funding the operation, who\u2019s telling them to go out and do these acts of violence, threats, and intimidation. \u2026 If you look at the intelligence monitors and the people that capture the images of these people, many of them are the same people, which tells me that they\u2019re being bused [and] transferred.

Yglesias subsequently deleted all tweets on his Twitter profile after describing Antifa\u2019s harassment of Carlson\u2019s family as \u201c[making] them feel some of the fear that the victims of MAGA-inspired violence feel thanks to the non-stop racial incitement coming from Tucker, Trump, etc.\u201d He further advised people to \u201cempathize with\u201d Carlson\u2019s \u201cvictims.\u201d\n\nCNN figures have repeatedly supported, defended, and misrepresented Antifa, including anchors Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo.

(AP) \u2014 A fast-moving wildfire that ravaged a Northern California town Thursday sent residents racing to escape on roads that turned into tunnels of fire as thick smoke darkened the daytime sky, wiping out what a Cal Fire official said was a couple of thousand structures.\n\n\u201cWe were surrounded by fire, we were driving through fire on each side of the road,\u201d said police officer Mark Bass, who lives in the hard-hit town of Paradise and works in neighboring Chico. He evacuated his family and then returned to the fire to help rescue several disabled residents, including a man trying to carry his bedridden wife to safety. \u201cIt was just a wall of fire on each side of us, and we could hardly see the road in front of us.\u201d\n\nHarrowing tales of escape and heroic rescues emerged from Paradise, where the entire community of 27,000 was ordered to evacuate. Witnesses reported seeing homes, supermarkets, businesses, restaurants, schools and a retirement home up in flames.\n\n\u201cPretty much the community of Paradise is destroyed, it\u2019s that kind of devastation,\u201d said Cal Fire Capt. Scott McLean late Thursday. He estimated that a couple of thousand structures were destroyed in the town about 180 miles northeast of San Francisco.\n\nMeanwhile, portions of Southern California remained under siege early Friday as two large fires threatened numerous Ventura County communities.

Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in the area and requested a federal emergency declaration, saying that high winds and dry brush presented ongoing danger.\n\nThe fire in Southern California was being whipped up Thursday evening by powerful winds that pushed it through canyons and to the edge of Camarillo Springs and Cal State Channel Islands, both of which were evacuated, The Los Angeles Times reported. The blaze broke out in the Hill Canyon area and in just 12 minutes jumped the 101 Freeway. By Thursday evening, it had scorched up to 7,000 acres and sent residents of more than 1,200 homes fleeing.\n\nFire officials said they expected it to burn all the way to the ocean. Television reports showed several homes on fire in the Oak Park community.

Online jail records show bond was set at $20,000 for both Garza and Ruby Tamez. A $10,000 bond was set for Gonzalez, Gutierrez, Belinda Rodriguez, Brenda Rodriguez, Rosendo Rodriguez, and Cynthia Tamez. Felisha Yolanda Rodriguez\u2019s bail was set at $1,000.\n\nThe Office of Hidalgo County District Attorney Ricardo Rodriguez will prosecute the cases.\n\nIn May, four other county residents were charged with voter fraud related to the 2017 Edinburg election. One of the accused was also a convicted human smuggler. Another was only charged with making a false statement on a voter registration form, a Class B misdemeanor. In June, they charged a fifth person with two counts of illegal voting.\n\nTo date, a total of 14 people stand accused of violating election laws in the 2017 Edinburg city election.\n\nIn Texas, it is a state jail felony to vote in an election using fraudulent ballot application information. The crime is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.\n\nMore arrests are expected in Hidalgo County over last year\u2019s purported illegal voting scheme in Edinburg. The Texas Rangers are assisting the AG\u2019s Election Fraud Unit in this investigation.\n\nHidalgo County is one of several hotbeds of alleged voter fraud activity where the AG\u2019s office has lent support and assistance to investigations conducted by local district attorneys. In 2015, newly sworn-in Hidalgo County DA Rodriguez vowed to curb public corruption.\n\nThis summer, a Hidalgo County grand jury indicted a non-U.S. citizen on a charge of illegal voting for marking a ballot without a voter\u2019s consent in a June 2016 Hidalgo city runoff election. Two of her fellow campaign workers were implicated in the alleged voter assistance scheme. All stand accused of taking advantage of elderly and/or disabled voters.\n\nEarlier this year, Paxton announced a significant voter fraud initiative in the adjacent Starr County where DA Omar Escobar pledged to crack down on voter fraud after questionable registrant records and mail-in ballot applications surfaced. Officials made seven arrests.\n\nRecently, four North Texas women, who allegedly belonged to a paid voter fraud ring in Tarrant County, were indicted on 30 counts of voter fraud following an investigation by the AG\u2019s office. Purportedly, they sought to influence the outcome of certain down-ballot candidate races in the 2016 March Democratic Party primary election. Court documents filed by Paxton\u2019s office accused the county\u2019s former Democratic Party executive director of funding the voter fraud ring\u2019s criminal activities.\n\nThe Rio Grande Valley area also made national news before the 2018 election when the Public Interest Legal Foundation released a complaint to county and state officers regarding \u201caltered\u201d voter registration forms circulated by the Texas Democratic Party that were directed to noncitizen residents. The applications featured pre-printed claims of U.S. citizenship. The Texas Secretary of State referred the matter to Attorney General Paxton for further investigation.

Abandoned by their own government. Abandoned by the international community. The message that I\u2019m bringing is that America cares. America is with them. America is on the ground. They can count on the United States to be a country that leads the world in helping them return home.\n\nAddressing Christians, Yazidis, and other minorities who want to return, he stressed, \u201cWe\u2019re your partner. We want to help you. We\u2019re there on the ground. We\u2019re working directly with you. We have mobilized a significant amount of resources. We are politically engaged this is a priority in our bilateral relations with the Iraqi government.\u201d\n\nLast month, USAID announced more than $178 million in U.S. foreign assistance to support religious minorities in Iraq, bringing total U.S. assistance for the vulnerable communities to nearly $300 million.\n\nVice President Mike Pence had vowed almost a year earlier to the day to send aid directly to the persecuted minorities in Iraq through USAID and through faith-based organizations that operate in the area.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is now prioritizing the security of religious minorities in Iraq, Primorac said.\n\nThe U.S. has particularly redoubled efforts to \u201cdirectly\u201d assist genocide victims, he added, noting that the move is \u201ca radical departure\u201d from the previous administration.\n\nPrimorac explained:\n\nBefore [the Trump administration] we were spending funds to support these [minority aid] organizations, but we were doing [the work] for them and above them. They weren\u2019t fully engaged or included in the manner in which we were doing things. That has changed dramatically \u2026 It\u2019s full inclusion \u2026 As a result, I think we\u2019re much more effective in the expenditure of taxpayer funds \u2026 We are funding them directly.

It is believed to be the cradle of Christianity.\n\n\u201cMore than 1000 families have returned,\u201d Father Salar Boudagh, the local Chaldean priest, recently said.\u201dBut most of them came from other places.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018", "The night before the midterm elections, House Speaker Paul Ryan touted \u201ctax reform 2.0,\u201d the economy, and the rebuilding of the United States military as the agenda accomplishments of the Republican-controlled Congress.\n\n\u201cFrankly, our members feel pretty good because they have a really good message \u2026 I mean look at what we\u2019ve just been able to achieve in Congress with the President in the last two years,\u201d Ryan told Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier. \u201cA record economy, the military being rebuilt, people feeling better about things \u2026 wages growing faster than they have since before the recession.\u201d\n\nThe accomplishments of the GOP Congress, though, have been slim with Ryan in charge. Despite President Trump winning the 2016 presidential election with a populist message on healthcare and a nationalist message on immigration, Ryan and the Republican Congress failed to deliver reforms on either of the issues.\n\nThat failure was evident in the midterm elections Tuesday night as Democrats regained control of the House running on the talking point that Republicans have been unsuccessful in bringing down the cost of healthcare.\n\nIn the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency, no immigration plan was coordinated and the populist initiative that the president touted on healthcare \u2014 allowing Americans to buy plans across state lines \u2014 quickly fell apart in the House and Senate when Republicans did not have the votes to replace Obamacare.\n\nA handful of healthcare reforms were enacted, mostly by Trump through regulation changes and an executive order, but Republicans were unable to coalesce a national message around their subtle reforms. This ultimately led to individual Republicans having to defend themselves against attacks that they would strip away protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe only major piece of legislation in the two years of Ryan\u2019s speakership under Trump came in the form of tax cuts \u2014 which since its passing has become increasingly unpopular.\n\nLast year, the White House released an extensive list of immigration principles that the administration was looking for the GOP Congress to adopt with legislation.\n\nTrump\u2019s manifesto included full funding for a border wall, making E-Verify mandatory to stop illegal hiring, ending the process of \u201cchain migration\u201d that has driven mass legal immigration to the country, and ending the unpopular Diversity Visa Lottery which gives out 50,000 visas every year to a random selection of foreign nationals.\n\nEven with a terrorist attack suspected to have been committed by a foreign national who arrived in the U.S. on the Visa Lottery program, Ryan\u2019s GOP Congress did not make any reforms to the country\u2019s immigration system.\n\nThus, the first year of Trump ended with no successful legislative agenda from Ryan and the Republicans on immigration or health care.\n\nMonths later, in April of this year, the Republicans came upon a moment to secure full funding for Trump\u2019s proposed border wall. The omnibus spending bill presented an opportunity for Trump\u2019s pro-American immigration reforms.\n\nYet again, the effort failed with the leadership of Ryan.\n\nInstead, the omnibus spending bill only gave Trump $1.6 billion for his border wall and barred him from building a wall using the prototypes that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had been testing in the San Diego desert. The omnibus spending bill has relegated Trump to building new border wall barriers of the same materials used by the Bush and Obama administrations.\n\nDuring the Fox News interview the night before the midterms, Ryan noted Democrats\u2019 campaign to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.\n\n\u201cLook, people do care about national security,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe want a secure border, that\u2019s really clear. The Democrats want to abolish ICE, it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\nBut, the omnibus spending bill did not fund the 1,000 new ICE agents that Trump had asked and allowed for more Catch and Release at the border by not funding adequate detention space for border crossers and asylum seekers to be housed in while they await their hearings.\n\nLess than a year after Attorney General Jeff Sessions ended President Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) amnesty program for more than a million illegal aliens, a group of \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican House members tried to force a DACA amnesty through Congress through a discharge petition.\n\nRyan did not thwart the discharge petition, nor did he have funding pulled from the congressional members involved with the petition. Many of those DACA amnesty House Republicans lost in the midterms, including Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-FL) and Rep. Mia Love (R-UT).\n\nThe billionaire Steve Schwarzman who convinced Trump for months not to end the DACA program is one of the largest donors to the Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) which is closely aligned with Ryan.\n\nBetween March and October, the eight months leading up to the midterm elections, immigration became the number one priority of GOP voters, conservatives, and Trump supporters. Tax reform was consistently one of the lowest priorities of voters.\n\nAmong all U.S. voters, health care and immigration were the biggest issues facing the nation.\n\nFor Ryan, the health care and immigration priorities of Americans continued to be of no concern to him as he refused to sway from his economic libertarian agenda despite there being no support for such a plan even amongst his own constituency.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that got away from us, which is my signature issue, is entitlement reform,\u201d Ryan said in an April interview.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Breitbart News in May, Trump adviser Stephen Miller said immigration would be the leading issue heading into the midterm elections. Trump, likewise, increasingly shifted his midterm election message away from tax cuts and towards immigration.\n\nStill, Ryan and the Republican establishment focused their attention on tax reform and their disdain for Obamacare despite providing no legislative track on the issue.\n\n\u201cAnd the Democrats are talking about rolling back and raising taxes, more spending, they\u2019re proposing basically to undo all the progress we\u2019ve been having,\u201d Ryan said in his last interview before the midterm elections. \u201cAnd they want socialized medicine which would be a disaster for our country plus a $32 trillion tax increase to pay for it.\u201d\n\nThen, with the latest defense spending bill, Trump\u2019s border wall was ignored once again despite voters\u2019 brewing frustration that the president\u2019s nationalist immigration agenda was being held up by his own party in Congress.\n\nThe final days leading up to the midterm elections, Trump ignited his base and swing voters by raising the issue of birthright citizenship where the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens are given automatic U.S. citizenship. The policy has resulted in an anchor baby population of at least 4.5 million with nearly 300,000 being rewarded with citizenship every year.\n\nRyan punted the issue, telling local media that Trump did not have the authority to end the anchor baby policy through executive action, comparing the president to Obama.\n\n\u201cYou cannot end birthright citizenship with an Executive Order,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws via executive action, and obviously as conservatives, we believe in the Constitution.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Republican voters and conservatives sided with Trump against Ryan\u2019s comment, with more than 7-in-10 Republicans telling pollsters just before the midterms that birthright citizenship should be ended.\n\nAt the ballot box, U.S. voters elected Democrats to take back control of the House. In exit polls, voters confirmed what Trump had known all along but what Ryan had refused to deliver on in favor of his conservative beltway platform.\n\nAmerican voters for the ninth consecutive month said health care and immigration were the issues that drove them to the polls.

It was during this hiatus that he penned a handwritten letter to his beloved younger sister, Maja, warning of the dangers of growing nationalism and anti-Semitism years before the Nazis ultimately rose to power, forcing Einstein to flee his native Germany for good.\n\n\u201cOut here, nobody knows where I am, and I\u2019m believed to be missing,\u201d he wrote in August 1922. \u201cHere are brewing economically and politically dark times, so I\u2019m happy to be able to get away from everything.\u201d\n\nThe previously unknown letter, brought forward by an anonymous collector, is set to go on auction next week in Jerusalem with an opening asking price of $12,000.\n\nAs the most influential scientist of the 20th century, Einstein\u2019s life and writings have been thoroughly researched. The Hebrew University in Jerusalem, of which Einstein was a founder, houses the world\u2019s largest collection of Einstein material. Together with the California Institute of Technology it runs the Einstein Papers Project. Individual auctions of his personal letters have brought in substantial sums in recent years.\n\nThe 1922 letter shows he was concerned about Germany\u2019s future a full year before the Nazis even attempted their first coup \u2014 the failed Munich Beer Hall Putsch to seize power in Bavaria.\n\n\u201cThis letter reveals to us the thoughts that were running through Einstein\u2019s mind and heart at a very preliminary stage of Nazi terror,\u201d said Meron Eren, co-owner of the Kedem Auction House in Jerusalem, which obtained the letter and offered The Associated Press a glimpse before the public sale. \u201cThe relationship between Albert and Maja was very special and close, which adds another dimension to Einstein the man and greater authenticity to his writings.\u201d\n\nThe letter, which bears no return address, is presumed to have been written while he was staying in the port city of Kiel before embarking on a lengthy speaking tour across Asia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing pretty well, despite all the anti-Semites among the German colleagues. I\u2019m very reclusive here, without noise and without unpleasant feelings, and am earning my money mainly independent of the state, so that I\u2019m really a free man,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou see, I am about to become some kind of itinerant preacher. That is, firstly, pleasant and, secondly, necessary.\u201d\n\nAddressing his sister\u2019s concerns, Einstein writes: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, I myself don\u2019t worry either, even if it\u2019s not quite kosher, people are very upset. In Italy, it seems to be at least as bad.\u201d\n\nLater in 1922, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics.\n\nZe\u2019ev Rosenkrantz, the assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at Caltech, said the letter wasn\u2019t the first time Einstein warned about German anti-Semitism, but it captured his state of mind at this important junction after Rathenau\u2019s killing and the \u201cinternal exile\u201d he imposed on himself shortly after it.\n\n\u201cEinstein\u2019s initial reaction was one of panic and a desire to leave Germany for good. Within a week, he had changed his mind,\u201d he said. \u201cThe letter reveals a mindset rather typical of Einstein in which he claims to be impervious to external pressures. One reason may be to assuage his sister\u2019s concerns. Another is that he didn\u2019t like to admit that he was stressed about external factors.\u201d\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power and began enacting legislation against Jews, they also aimed to purge Jewish scientists. The Nazis dismissed Einstein\u2019s groundbreaking work, including his Law of Relativity, as \u201cJewish Physics.\u201d\n\nEinstein renounced his German citizenship in 1933 after Hitler became chancellor. The physicist settled in the United States, where he would remain until his death in 1955.\n\nEinstein declined an invitation to serve as the first president of the newly established state of Israel but left behind his literary estate and personal papers to the Hebrew University.", "French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said anti-Semitic acts in France jumped by 69 percent in the first nine months of 2018, announcing the rise on Friday as Europe pauses to remember the 80th anniversary of the infamous \u201cKristallnacht\u201d of Nazi attacks against Jews.\n\n\u201cEvery aggression perpetrated against one of our citizens because they are Jewish echoes like the breaking of new crystal,\u201d Philippe wrote on Facebook, referring to the start of the Nazi drive to eliminate Jews on November 9, 1938, also known as the Night of Broken Glass.\n\n\u201cWhy recall, in 2018, such a painful memory?

It is by fighting together that we will gain the trust of our fellow Europeans because this election will be tougher than ever before,\u201d Mr Barnier said.\n\n\u201cWe have to fight against those who want to demolish Europe with their fear, their populist deceit, their attacks against the European project.\n\n\u201cThere is now a Farage in every country \u2013 in every country,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Telegraph said that Nigel Farage responded with \u201cundisguised glee\u201d that the leading Brexiteer\u2019s threat of influence amongst populist circles weighed so heavily on the Eurocrat, saying: \u201cI thank Mr Barnier for the compliment.\u201d\n\nThe Frenchman\u2019s fears of a collapse of the globalist bloc manifested earlier in the week on Monday when he revealed that Mr Farage had warned him once the UK leaves, the EU will fall apart.\n\n\u201cI told him,\u201d Mr Barnier said, \u201c\u2018You led Brexit, you won and now we are delivering Brexit. Can I ask you how you see the relationship between the UK and the EU after Brexit?\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd he said this, \u2018Mr. Barnier, after Brexit the EU will no longer exist.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow Mr Farage to be right.\u201d\n\nAnalysis by Reuters over the summer projected that there will be a populist surge at the European Parliament elections, with eurosceptic parties expanding their strength by over 60 per cent.\n\nSo aware of the threat of Europeans voting in record numbers against greater surrender of power to Brussels that European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said in June that the establishment must unite to stop \u201crampant populism\u201d before then.\n\nThat same month, the European Parliament\u2019s chief Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt even said, in his trademark bombastic manner, that Mr Farage and his eurosceptic colleagues in the Parliament were a \u201cfifth column\u201d whose sole goal is to \u201cdestroy Europe [and] to kill our liberal democracy.\u201d\n\nHungary\u2019s conservative Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Italy\u2019s anti-establishment Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini announced in August they were to form a populist front ahead of EP elections to challenge French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron\u2019s globalist vision of the bloc.\n\nIn September 2016, three months after the UK defied the political establishment and voted to leave the EU, Mr Farage said that the West needed a \u201cdemocratic renaissance\u201d to give the power back to the people.\n\nTwo months later, the people of the United States elected Donald Trump, with the former UKIP leader stating that the populist wave in America and Europe would not have happened first without Brexit \u2014 a mandate Farage had been campaigning for for decades.\n\nSince then, the right-wing, Eurosceptics, and populists have been elected or made gains across Europe in national elections including in Sweden, Italy, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Germany.", "Businesses and progressives, Democrats and Republicans, will try to sneak a bipartisan amnesty bill through Congress\u2019 lame-duck session in December as voters are distracted by Christmas, say pro-American immigration reformers.\n\n\u201cThis is why they come back for a lame duck \u2014 so they can accomplish all the things they could not do when the voters\u2019 eyes on them,\u201d said Rosemary Jenks, the director of government relations for NumbersUSA.\n\nThe lame-duck session is scheduled for December because GOP and Democratic leaders stalled 2019 spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security and the border wall. Without 2019 funding, some subsidiary DHS offices will close in December.\n\nOne huge danger ahead, said Jenks, is that retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan will push an amnesty bill to help Wall Street and the cheap-labor lobbyists in Washington. \u201cI fully expect that Paul Ryan will do as much as he possibly can on his way out the door because he is just on the other side\u201d of the public\u2019s preference for a low-immigration, high-wage, economic policy, she said.\n\n\u201cThe big fear is that we go back into [White House] talks about exchanging DACA for a border wall,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not acceptable because a wall [alone] is not going to have a significant impact on illegal immigration.\u201d For example, cartel smugglers advise their illegal-migrant clients to claim asylum and to bring children, because those tactics trigger the catch-and-release loopholes which allow migrants to walk through the existing fences and into U.S. jobs, she said.\n\n\u201cA [wall-for-DACA] deal like that would just set us for the next amnesty\u201d once more migrants rush their children across the border to declare them as the next generation of DACA migrants, she said.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 no-strings DACA deal would put roughly 3 million resident illegals on a fast-track to citizenship and the ballot-box, and also allow the new immigrants to bring millions of their family members via unreformed chain-migration rules.\n\nThe wall-for-DACA deal is damaging, which is \u201cprecisely why [Sen. Chuck] Schumer and [Rep. Nancy] Pelosi were willing to go along with it last time,\u201d she said.\n\nAn amnesty-for-wall deal is not needed.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly said he expects to get another $1.6 billion for border-fence funding in December. That number will bring his total spending on the wall up to $4.8 billion in three years.\n\nAlso, Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American,\u201d no-amnesty policies are successfully pushing voters\u2019 wages up before the 202o elections. Wages are rising because CEOs complain they cannot hire additional cheap legal immigrants or visa workers \u2014 and because they increasingly risk prosecution if they hire even cheaper illegal migrants.\n\nTrump celebrates rising wages caused by his growing economy & his immigration curbs. Next: Will Trump decide that well-paid & happy voters are better for his 2020 relection race than happy donors? https://t.co/nZnFtywTr1 \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) November 2, 2018\n\nAlso, Trump is using the no-cost experts and rules provided by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to help curb border migration.\n\nBut CEOs will push for a last-minute December amnesty because the push will cost them nothing to try, because they want to flood the labor market to stall Americans\u2019 rising wages, and because they are losing many of their House GOP supporters in January.\n\nRoughly half of the GOP\u2019s 34 legislators who openly backed business-backed amnesty measures in 2017 and 2018 will be gone from Congress in January, according to a survey by Breitbart News. The legislators will be gone because they were defeated by Democrats or because they retired before the election.\n\nThe roughly 16 exiting legislators include Virginia\u2019s Rep. Scott Tayler, Florida\u2019s Chris Curbelo, Utah\u2019s Mia Love, Pennsylvania\u2019s Charlie Dent, Colorado\u2019s Mike Coffman, New Jersey\u2019s Leonard Lance, Texas Joe Barton, and several others.\n\nThe pro-amnesty GOP legislators backed a Discharge Petition in May 2018 which threatened to let Democrats pass a huge pro-amnesty bill in Ryan\u2019s House, or signed a pro-amnesty letter in December 2017 which called for a no-strings amnesty for roughly 3 million \u2018DACA\u2019 illegal immigrants.\n\nThe two pushes were backed by many business donors, via such groups as the Congressional Leadership Fund and FWD.us, a lobbying group for West Coast investors, including Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nBoth amnesty pushes were used by Ryan and his deputies to zig-zag towards an amnesty bill. Ryan\u2019s plans crashed in June when 111 GOP legislators voted against his draft amnesty bill. A pro-American version of the reform bill, drafted by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, was blocked by 41 business-first GOP legislators, with the tacit approval of Ryan.\n\nRetiring Ryan has been a strong advocate for a cheap-labor amnesty for many years, along with several of his top allies, including Texas Rep. Pete Sessions, a business-first legislator who runs the critical rules committee.\n\nBut Ryan is retiring, and Sessions was defeated in his immigrant-heavy Dallas County district after 22 years in Congress. \u201cIn 2010, I was proud to lead the effort to bring in a wave of conservatism and put our country on the path towards economic prosperity,\u201d Sessions said in his concession speech. \u201cUnfortunately, that success was not enough to stem the liberal tide of people who have moved here from across the country.\u201d\n\nAnother group of GOP legislators quietly backed Kansas Rep. Kevin Yoder\u2019s July 25 push to provide fast-track green cards to roughly 300,000 Indian and Chinese visa-workers and their families.\n\nThe green-card giveaway was added in a surprise last-minute move by Yoder to the 2019 spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security. The Yoder giveaway was combined with a rollback of border security, plus an expansion of H-2A and H-2B work-visas for farmers and the landscaping industry, and it was sweetened with the promise of $5 billion for a border wall. GOP legislators knew Yoder\u2019s measure was unpopular, so they approved it via an anonymous, unrecorded voice-vote.\n\nThose Yoder provisions are in the House spending bill. Some form of the DHS bill must be approved by the House and merged with the Senate funding bill.\n\nYoder used the promise of a green-card giveaway to win votes from Indian immigrants in his Kansas district \u2014 but he was defeated by a massive turnout of American college-graduate voters who would lose jobs and salaries to Yoder\u2019s wave of college-grad outsourcing workers. Yoder\u2019s campaign was publicly opposed by a group of U.S. professionals who rented billboards in his district.\n\n\u201cSomebody should learn some kind of lesson from\u201d Yoder\u2019s defeat, Jenks said. But, she added, the pro-amnesty GOP legislators \u201cdon\u2019t normally learn lessons from anything.\u201d\n\nDemocrats also fail to recognize that voters dislike cheap-labor amnesties. In 2014, Schumer lost nine Senate seats after pushing the 2013 \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty. After that experience, he quickly ended his pro-amnesty plan in January to block government funding once overnight polls showed it was very unpopular.\n\nIn the House, yet more GOP legislators pushed hard for a new \u201cH-2C\u201d work visa program that would allow their farm-district supporters to hire foreign farmworkers for much less than they have to pay to use the fast-growing H-2A farm-worker visa.\n\nThe H-2C push was largely blocked by West Coast agribusiness groups who are closely allied to Democrats. In turn, Democratic legislators want at least 1 million illegal farm-workers to get a fast-track to green cards and citizenship.\n\nThe temporary failure of the H-2C push is now forcing farms and dairies to pay higher salaries to their existing workforces and to buy additional farm machinery from American factory workers.\n\nJenks\u2019 fear is that the various pro-amnesty GOP legislators who support the DACA amnesty, the green-card giveaway, the H-2B expansion, and the H-2C program may be united by Ryan and Trump in December for another dash towards a big bipartisan cheap-labor amnesty in exchange for a wall that cannot stop savvy asylum-seeking economic migrants.\n\n\u201cYou can hear the bipartisan talk about \u2018solutions\u2019 now,\u201d said Jenks. \u201cThat is never good on immigration.\u201d\n\nWashington knows the Democrats will be running the House next year, Jenks said. \u201cIt is now a matter of stopping bad deals \u2026 that is what we need [GOP legislators] to focus on.\u201d", "President Donald Trump called the results of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections a \u201csuccess.\u201d And they were, in some ways.\n\nRepublicans picked up seats in the Senate and saved several governorships, thanks in part to the president\u2019s campaigning.\n\nAnd Trump may be right that a House of Representatives with a narrow Democratic majority might allow him to accomplish more than he would have with a narrow, Republican majority vulnerable to spoilers.\n\nBut despite his optimism, the fact is that Tuesday was also a failure: Trump and the Republicans should have held the House.\n\nYes, the president\u2019s party loses an average of about 30 seats in midterm elections.\n\nBut this presidency, by its own estimation, is hardly an average one. The economy has never been so good heading into a midterm election. Moreover, the map favored Republicans because it was largely drawn by Republicans after the Tea Party wave election of 2010.\n\nRepublican National Committee (RNC) chair Ronna McDaniel took an ill-advised victory lap in an op-ed at Fox News on Thursday. \u201cWe staved off a blue wave thanks to the Republican National Committee\u2019s (RNC) largest-ever ground game and record-setting fundraising, and President Trump\u2019s energizing rallies for our candidates,\u201d she said, citing \u201cminimal losses.\u201d\n\nNowhere in the entire op-ed did McDaniel acknowledge losing control of the U.S. House \u2014 and the agenda.\n\nIn the real world, the voters sent a clear rebuke to the president and his party.\n\nThe danger is that neither will hear it, because the message is being delivered by the media, who continue to discredit themselves with their hatred of Trump.\n\nBut the exit polls tell the story. Despite the strong economy, only 41% of voters believe the country is on the right track, while 56% \u2014 including 58% of independent voters \u2014 believe it is on the wrong track.\n\nThere are three basic reasons that Republicans lost the House:\n\n1. The Republicans failed to honor their promise to repeal and replace Obamacare with a decent health insurance policy; 2. Americans feel that the country is divided and that the president is not doing enough to unite us; 3. Republican leaders failed to build lasting relationships with Trump voters in blue states, especially in the Upper Midwest.\n\nOn health care, Trump not only promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but to ensure every American enjoyed health insurance coverage. Thus far, he has only managed to make small changes, such as repealing the individual mandate and expanding access to cheap short-term plans. Last year, he hinted at a an Australian-style system, where the government covers basic health care, and private insurance covers the rest. But he never introduced that plan.\n\nThat is not entirely his fault. The Republican leadership in Congress assured the president that they would handle health care. But they failed, though they owed their mandate to the rebellion against Obamacare. And the reason they failed was not because of John McCain. His \u201cthumbs down\u201d came during a vote on the \u201cskinny repeal\u201d of the individual mandate, not the broader policy; he later voted, less theatrically, to repeal the mandate in the tax cut bill.\n\nThe reason Republicans failed was their policy was bad. Policy experts loved it, but the American people did not trust it, because they were never convinced it would guarantee them the security of coverage at an affordable price.\n\nNor did Republican leaders undertake the political task of building a coalition of support for their new legislation. They didn\u2019t care enough about their own idea to bother selling it. That sent a signal that they did not believe in it.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 unofficial alternative, \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d is a complete disaster. It has failed everywhere that it has been tried \u2014 including Vermont, the home state of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who championed the idea. But the idea is appealing because Medicare, which guarantees Americans will not become destitute as we age, is so popular.\n\nA bad idea beats no idea at all. Trump\u2019s own idea was much better, but he never campaigned on it.\n\nTrump campaigned on other issues, like immigration, which is very important to Republican voters. But he also devoted a great deal of time and energy to bitter fights.\n\nSome, like the fight over football players kneeling for the national anthem, were worth having. Others, like the fight over the size of the crowd at the inauguration, were not.\n\nArguably, the Democrats and the media bear more of the blame for the decline in tone. But Trump \u2014 as he himself acknowledged \u2014 must do better.\n\nThe good news is that Trump can address health care and political divisions at once. Passing a bipartisan health care bill would allow Trump and the Republicans to show that they have compassion, and that they can work together with the opposition.\n\nDemocrats might prefer to deny Trump that victory \u2014 but if the president and the Senate set the right tone, they can leave the Democrats no alternative but to play along.\n\nFixing health care will help Trump show the blue-state voters who backed him in 2016 that he has delivered. Those voters are still there.\n\nBut he has to reach out to them. The GOP has spent very little effort building up the Trump coalition, losing ten of 12 blue districts Trump won in 2016 while Democrats won 18 of 25 red districts Hillary Clinton won. (Trump, like Hillary in 2016, ignored Michigan in 2018.)\n\nMcDaniel\u2019s \u201chappy talk\u201d will not help. Trump and the Republicans should recognize they lost in 2018 \u2014 and make the necessary changes, now.\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

The piece highlights the group\u2019s recent \u201cblunders,\u201d including its failed attempt to brand moderate Islam critic Maajid Nawaz and HUD Secretary Ben Carson as \u201cextremists.\u201d\n\nThe Post, despite its largely left-wing editorial line, admitted that the SPLC\u2019s reputation has taken a hit in recent years thanks to its overzealous adding of conservative groups to its \u201chate list\u201d:\n\nFor decades, the hate list was a golden seal of disapproval, considered nonpartisan enough to be heeded by government agencies, police departments, corporations and journalists. But in recent years, as the list has swept up an increasing number of conservative activists \u2014 mostly in the anti-LGBT, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim categories \u2014 those conservatives have been fighting back. Boykin, of the FRC, recently sent a letter to about 100 media outlets (including The Washington Post) and corporate donors on behalf of four dozen groups and individuals \u201cwho have been targeted, defamed, or otherwise harmed\u201d by the SPLC, warning that the hate list is no longer to be trusted. Mathew Staver, chairman of the Christian legal advocacy group Liberty Counsel, told me 60 organizations are interested in suing the SPLC. There are signs the campaign is having an impact. Last year GuideStar, a widely consulted directory of charitable organizations, flagged 46 charities that were listed by the SPLC as hate groups. Within months, under pressure from critics, GuideStar announced it was removing the flags. The FBI has worked with the SPLC in the past on outreach programs, but Attorney General Jeff Sessions has signaled a very different attitude. At a meeting of the Alliance Defending Freedom in August, Sessions said, \u201cYou are not a hate group,\u201d and condemned the SPLC for using the label \u201cto bully and to intimidate groups like yours which fight for religious freedom.\u201d\n\nThe Post went on to admit that the SPLC damaged its own reputation with \u201cblunders\u201d:\n\nAlong the way, the SPLC undermined its own credibility with a couple of blunders. In 2015, it apologized for listing Ben Carson as an extremist (though not on the hate list), saying the characterization was inaccurate. Then, this past June, the group paid $3.4 million to Muslim activist Maajid Nawaz and his Quilliam organization to settle a threatened lawsuit. The SPLC had listed them in a \u201cField Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists\u201d (again, not on the main hate list). The SPLC apologized for misunderstanding Nawaz\u2019s work to counter Islamist extremism.\n\nThe rest of the piece, which can be read in full at the Washington Post, takes a deep dive into the SPLC\u2019s allegations of \u201chatred\u201d and \u201cextremism\u201d against mainstream conservative groups, including the Family Research Center and the Center for Immigration Studies. The Post interviews representatives of both groups, allowing them to present their side of the story.\n\nDespite the length of the piece, the Post fails to mention other egregious blunders from SPLC, such as its decision to brand Somalian-Dutch activist and female genital mutilation survivor Ayaan Hirsi Ali an \u201canti-Muslim extremist\u201d and \u201cpropagandist.\u201d Hirsi Ali, a self-described feminist, subsequently published an article slamming the SPLC in the New York Times.\n\nThe left-wing Post\u2019s concession that the SPLC has been overzealous in its attempts to brand critics of progressive identity politics, Christian groups, and advocates for limited immigration as \u201chateful\u201d or \u201cextremist\u201d is likely to add to the pressure on businesses and organizations that use the SPLC as a source of advice.\n\nThis includes Silicon Valley, where multiple major tech companies work with the SPLC. These include Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Amazon (whose owner, Jeff Bezos, also owns the Washington Post \u2014 something the Post discloses in its article).\n\nAll of these companies \u2014 the first three in particular \u2014 have been accused of political bias and censorship, often as a result of an overzealous application of the \u201chate speech\u201d label. A recent, crazy example involved a YouTuber who was banned for \u201cviolence\u201d because he killed a suffragette character in a video game.\n\nWith allegations of bias now coming from the president himself, more scrutiny will fall on the SPLC\u2019s role in advising these tech companies. How many of the group\u2019s \u201cblunders\u201d are working their way into the algorithms of Google, Twitter, Facebook, and the other platforms that now control so much of our daily lives?\n\nAllum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

Just last year, the country\u2019s Ministry of Health launched a large-scale vaccination ambitious catchup campaign targeting 67 million children aged between nine months to 15 years.\n\nAccording to statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), the first phase of the campaign was successful, with officials reaching 95 percent coverage as measles and rubella cases fell by over 90 percent.\n\nYet the plan ran into difficulty in August after the Indonesian Ulama Council (MUI) determined the vaccine as \u201charam,\u201d despite lobbying efforts from the Health Ministry to declare it halal. The MUI eventually issued a fatwa allowing Muslims to use the vaccine until it is replaced by a halal alternative, but many patients chose not to receive the vaccines in the interim.\n\n\u201cFirst, there is a condition of necessity (sharia emergency), second a halal and holy MR vaccine has yet to be made,\u201d the MUI said at the time. \u201cThird, competent and trusted experts have explained the dangers posed by not being immunized due to the lack of a halal vaccine \u2026 The government has to use religious considerations as guidelines in immunization and medical treatment.\u201d\n\nHowever, the controversy has caused a major fall in rates of vaccination, with millions of families now choosing to abstain from the vaccine due to their religious concerns.\n\nDespite being a non-governmental organization, the MUI receives funding and support from the government of Indonesia, which is based on Islamic theocracy. It oversees all of Indonesia\u2019s mosques and Muslim organizations, with the power to issue halal certifications and even regulate Islamic banking.\n\nPresident Jokowo Widodo, who is running for re-election next April, recently chose MUI leader Ma\u2019ruf Amin as his running mate, causing concern among who human rights campaigners claim that Amin is a religious extremist who preaches discrimination against homosexuals and the enforcement of blasphemy laws.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "Congressional Districts with booming foreign-born populations sent some of the most far-left, socialist Democrats to Congress in the midterm elections this week.\n\nOn Tuesday night, congressional districts that have been dramatically changed by mass immigration elected Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, Ilhan Omar in Minnesota, and Ayanna Pressley in Massachusettes.\n\nThe congressional districts sending some of the most liberal, far-left Democrats to Congress have large foreign-born populations that do not seem to be leveling off anytime soon as the U.S. continues admitting more than 1.5 million foreign nationals every year.\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s district, New York\u2019s 14th, has a foreign-born population that is now nearing almost 50 percent.

She added:\n\nThey should not have to parse through a 500-page legal document to understand how a law or policy affects their children\u2019s education. This guide demonstrates our ongoing commitment to providing parents with user-friendly tools and the information necessary to make informed decisions. Informed parents become empowered and engaged parents who are able to better advocate on behalf of their children.\n\nIronically, the federal \u201cguide\u201d is titled \u201cA Parent Guide to State and Local Report Cards.\u201d DeVos is advertising the guide as a means to achieve \u201ctransparency\u201d about the accountability requirements of the federal law known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).\n\nIn the guide, the education department explains that ESSA requires student report cards to display information about how much money from federal, state, and local sources is spent per student for each school. The law also mandates that report cards provide results of annual statewide tests in reading, English language arts, math, and science, and results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).\n\nAccording to the department, ESSA states report cards must also provide parents with information about school disciplinary measures such as number of suspensions, expulsions, arrests, and incidents of violence in schools.\n\nAdditionally, the federal education law requires all parents to receive information about English-language learners, children with disabilities, and foster and homeless children in their schools on their children\u2019s report cards.\n\nDeVos has touted ESSA as the means to bring about more state flexibility in control of education, though state education plans must still be approved by the federal government. The secretary has also said on several occasions that ESSA has done away with the Common Core standards, though some 42 states are still using the Common Core standards or its \u201crebrands.\u201d\n\nIn a recent article at the Federalist, Utah parent organizer Autumn Foster Cook wrote about ESSA:\n\nContrary to lawmakers\u2019 promises, ESSA did not free states to pursue independent educational goals, nor reduce reliance on testing. DeVos\u2019s administration seems inclined to enforce the constraints as rigidly as possible, with little deference to state law and parental rights, despite precisely opposite rhetoric from DeVos, the Trump administration, and Republican congressional leadership that rushed ESSA into passage shortly before Barack Obama left office.\n\nShane Vander Hart also wrote at Truth in American Education that ESSA essentially cemented Common Core \u2013 and its standardized tests \u2013 into every state in the country.\n\n\u201cSure, the U.S. Department of Education is not actively pushing Common Core, they don\u2019t need to,\u201d Vander Hart explained. \u201cThe standards and assessment consortiums don\u2019t need to be funded anymore. The damage is done. They don\u2019t need to publicly push it because ESSA essentially codified Common Core.\u201d\n\nWhat if you could design a solution that would provide more accessible information for families and their advocates as they navigate students\u2019 options for a great education?

The one thing I think I underestimated was the degree to which some of those Obama-Trump voters who I nicknamed \u2018TIGRs\u2019 \u2014 Trump Is Great Republicans \u2014 actually stayed loyal.\u201d\n\nOlsen added, \u201cA lot of the polls suggested that they might be wavering and going back to Democrats, but in the end they pulled the Republicans\u2019 bacon out of the fire in a number of seats. Other than that, you look at a high-income suburb, and you saw virtually all of the Republican losses on Tuesday night.\u201d\n\nThe Republican establishment does not understand Trump\u2019s appeal, said Olsen.\n\n\u201cI think they still don\u2019t understand why Donald Trump is president, and I don\u2019t think they understand why there is a [Republican] Senate majority,\u201d stated Olsen. \u201cI think they\u2019re like the stereotypical country club person who wakes up on second base and thinks he hit a double.\u201d\n\nOlsen advised Republicans to field candidates who \u201cfit\u201d districts that went for Obama in 2012 and then for Trump in 2016. He said Republicans \u201cjust gave Democrats a pass\u201d in such districts.\n\nPollak stated, \u201cDemocrats went after the Republican districts where Hillary Clinton won, and there were seven of them in California. They picked up three of them. Why weren\u2019t Republicans trying to go on offense? The people who run the party infrastructure, maybe they just need to be replaced, and that means not just the elected officials, like party caucus leaders, but the people elected to run the RNC and the NRCC.\n\nPollak added, \u201cWhat are they doing if they\u2019re not finding candidates to run in working class areas that Trump won and to exploit that opportunity? I just feel like the party kind of failed at a leadership level.\u201d\n\nOlsen replied, \u201cAbsolutely it failed as a leadership level. \u2026 It\u2019s not that they didn\u2019t have a spokesman for the agenda. They have no agenda. It was obvious the whole two-year Congress that the only thing they wanted to do was cut taxes. That was it. They had no agenda to sell other than the tax cut.\u201d\n\nOlsen continued, \u201cTheir political theory was that once we cut taxes, people will be so grateful for the money in their pocket and the economy that they will reward us. There was no evidence to support that at any time during the last two cycles. To do that, they\u2019d have to rethink what being a Republican is, and they weren\u2019t willing to do that.\u201d\n\nOlsen declared, \u201cYou have a Republican Party in Washington that fundamentally doesn\u2019t want to govern. It doesn\u2019t want to make hard choices and provide leadership for public policy, It wants to cut taxes and get out of the way. That\u2019s not good politics.\u201d\n\nOlsen went on, \u201cThere were millions of people who were on the left wing of the old Republican Party who are now incensed about the president, and to not try at all to deal with that by either embracing the president or by trying to appeal to them directly, saying, \u2018Most Republicans like Donald Trump but there are a lot of Republicans who don\u2019t and you don\u2019t have to like Donald Trump to vote for a Republican, and here\u2019s why.'\u201d\n\nRepublicans cannot deploy half-measures on Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d agenda and expect to perform well, said Olsen.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re either in or you\u2019re out,\u201d said Olsen. \u201cThere are a lot of districts where, like Eric Paulson in Minnesota, if you were going to tie yourself to the president you were going to tie yourself to the 41 percent that the president got. But politics is not the hokey pokey where you put your left foot in, take your left foot out and shake it all about. You\u2019re either in or you\u2019re out.\u201d\n\nOlsen went on, \u201cSo there were very few, or virtually nobody in seats that were that bad that were willing to go all the way, so they got no credit. They pissed off Trump supporters. They angered Trump supporters by not being 100 percent or 90 percent loyal and they didn\u2019t get any credit from the people they were trying to win over because they were too loyal.\u201d\n\nOlsen added, \u201cYou just can\u2019t play with something as visceral as the way people feel about the president. You have to be in or you\u2019re out, and for those people who dallied about, they got what they deserved.\u201d\n\nOlsen advised Republicans to offer a balanced economic message to immigrants.\n\n\u201cRepublicans have had this theory for 30 or 40 years, which is,\u2019We don\u2019t have to change anything about economics. We\u2019re going to get all these immigrants because they\u2019re socially conservative,\u2019 and they are, but they\u2019re not animated by that,\u201d said Olsen. \u201cThey have more pressing life needs. They need good education, public services, some form of labor market assistance in order to make their way. They don\u2019t want socialism, but they don\u2019t want do-it-yourself libertarianism, either. Once you offer them something else that they\u2019re comfortable with, the fact that they\u2019re also mildly socially conservative means that you\u2019re not going to have intraparty warfare over those issues.\u201d\n\nOlsen continued, \u201cSome of these immigrants kind of agree with the base of the Republican Party over social conservatism, the need for families, and suspicion of a promiscuous culture, but you\u2019re not going to get them on that. You\u2019re going to have to get them on something that says, \u2018Here\u2019s how we\u2019re going to help your life, which is why you came to this country. We\u2019re the party that represents you. We\u2019re not the party that represents the people trying to tell you how to live your lives.'\u201d\n\nMansour said, \u201cI worry that the Republican establishment will turn around and say, \u2018You know what? It was about immigration. That\u2019s why we lost.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t. Or they\u2019ll blame Trump\u2019s trade policies. They\u2019ll basically try to throw those Trumpian voters under the bus in order and try to get rid of them to win back the RINOs in the suburbs.\u201d\n\nOlsen concurred, \u201cThat\u2019s my fear, too. I have a piece coming out tomorrow \u2026 making precisely the same argument. You dance with the girl that brung you. You have a majority because of these people that you traditionally have not wanted. The people who have been with you don\u2019t want to be part of this party, anymore. As long as the president is in the field, you\u2019re going to have a very hard time getting them back. So why don\u2019t you actually try to woo the voters who want to be part of you, rather than trying to go after voters who really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.", "Protests are taking place around the country Thursday night, organized by the leftist MoveOn and other anti-Trump organizations, including in Washington, DC, and New York City in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to ask for Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 resignation.\n\nProtesters believe Sessions\u2019 resignation will lead to the undoing of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into alleged collusion between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign.\n\nIn firing Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump has crossed a red line and started a constitutional crisis.
