Shortly before the 2016 election, for example, when Americans heard the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording of Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women, Corey Lewandowski, the Republican\u2019s former campaign manager, argued, \u201cWe\u2019re not choosing a Sunday school teacher here.\u201d\n\nIt was a concession of sorts, acknowledging Trump\u2019s character flaws and messy personal life, while simultaneously making the case that voters need not concern themselves with his morality.\n\nPolitically conservative evangelical Christians have made the same calculus throughout the Trump presidency: they don\u2019t need him to be moral, the argument goes, so much as they need him to help advance what they see as their moral agenda.\n\nIt therefore came as something of a surprise this week when Trump was asked directly about this aspect of his presidency.\n\nQ: How do you see your role as a moral leader? TRUMP: I think I am a great moral leader, and I love our country.\n\nWhether or not Trump deserves to be seen as a \u201cgreat moral leader\u201d is a matter of perspective, though the Republican\u2019s argument is very much at odds with the line his defenders \u2013 who say they back him despite his moral compass \u2013 usually tout.\n\nBut the president\u2019s line turned out to be poorly timed. Two days after boasting of his moral standing, the Wall Street Journal published a new, thoroughly detailed report on Trump\u2019s direct role in making legally dubious hush-money payments to women, including a former porn star, all of which he repeatedly lied to the public about.\n\n\u201cThe Wall Street Journal found that Mr. Trump was involved in or briefed on nearly every step of the agreements,\u201d the article read. \u201cHe directed deals in phone calls and meetings with his self-described fixer, Michael Cohen, and others. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan has gathered evidence of Mr. Trump\u2019s participation in the transactions.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it wasn\u2019t the ideal week for, \u201cI think I am a great moral leader.\u201d", "Watch the full episode of Friday night's The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell.\n\nDuration: {{video.duration.momentjs}}", "", "Florida again the scene of a post-election ballot-counting fight copied!\n\nJulia Nutter and Lisa Ferri, producers for The Rachel Maddow Show, report from outside the Broward County, Florida vote tabulation center on protests over the continued counting of Florida ballots and legal wrangling over greater transparency into that process.\n\nRead More", "New Trump acting-AG tied to fraud scheme under FBI investigation copied!\n\nMark Maremon, senior editor for The Wall Street Journal, talks with Rachel Maddow about the role Donald Trump's new acting-attorney general, Matt Whitaker, played in World Patent Marketing, which is under FBI investigation for defrauding customers of millions of dollars.\n\nRead More", "Watch the full episode of Friday night's The Rachel Maddow Show.\n\nDuration: {{video.duration.momentjs}}", "Lawyers in pitched battle over thorough counting of Florida votes copied!\n\nLeonard Samuels, attorney for the Florida Democrat Party, talks with Rachel Maddow about the Democrats' legal battle in Broward County, Florida to have all of the votes cast in Florida's election counted.\n\nRead More", "Michelle Obama on Trump's presidency: Where is the bottom? copied!\n\nIn her upcoming memoir, Michelle Obama criticizes Trump for birtherism and much more while revealing new details about her own life.

The man who\u2019s now the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement official is suddenly in a position where he\u2019s overseeing federal investigations he\u2019s condemned as a television commentator \u2013 including Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe of the Russia scandal.\n\nDuring a Q&A with reporters this morning, someone asked the president about Whitaker\u2019s record of provocative public comments as a pundit. He responded by suggesting that \u201ceverybody\u201d who\u2019d be considered to lead the Justice Department has been an on-air commentator.\n\n\u201cI see everybody on television \u2013 all these lawyers, all these law enforcement people making comment after comment. They never ask to get recused. They make comment. The fact that you go on Fox or CNN or MSNBC or anybody, and you make a comment, you\u2019d have nobody left to choose. You would have absolutely nobody left. \u201cI see different people, at different times, going on shows. Am I supposed to say, \u2018Oh, now he\u2019s never qualified to serve in government?\u2019 So, all the time I\u2019m watching many different people go on many different shows, saying many different things. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re unqualified. [\u2026] \u201c[Whitaker] did some shows; so did many of the people that you\u2019re talking about.

Does that mean we can\u2019t hire anybody?\u201d\n\nAs Aaron Rupar joked, \u201cTrump argues it\u2019s unfair to expect him to choose people for top [Justice Department] jobs who aren\u2019t TV pundits, because everybody is a TV pundit.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s funny, but it\u2019s not really an exaggeration. The president\u2019s approach follows a certain logic:\n\n1. Prominent legal figures regularly pontificate on television.\n\n2. The attorney general should be a prominent legal figure.\n\n3. Ergo, Trump must choose an attorney general he\u2019s seen pontificating on television.\n\nThe idea that a qualified person to serve as attorney general hasn\u2019t spent a lot of time on television apparently hasn\u2019t occurred to Trump.\n\nIn 1995, Nicole Kidman\u2019s character in a movie called \u201cTo Die For,\u201d says, \u201cYou\u2019re not really anybody in America unless you\u2019re on TV.\u201d The president may have taken that line a bit too literally.", "Rep.-Elect Tlaib: 'A new era of a civil rights movement' copied!\n\nThe 116th Congress is set to be the most diverse in American history.

We don\u2019t know which of the scandals, but there are apparently many to choose from.\n\nIt\u2019s against this backdrop that the Washington Post reports that Zinke doesn\u2019t appear to be working especially hard, either.\n\nRecently released public records show that Zinke has taken an unconventional approach to his job at times, including arranging meetings with multiple billionaires and taking 66 days of personal leave during his first year and-a-half on the job.

That total exceeds the 39 annual days off federal senior executives would be given during that same period. Center for Western Priorities spokesman Aaron Weiss, whose group is a sharp critic of Zinke, questioned why the secretary would take so much time off when Cabinet members usually only serve for a few years. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a lot of time to get stuff done,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWhat kind of message does that send if you\u2019re not even in the office approximately one week out of four?\u201d\n\nThe same article added that White House officials consider Zinke \u201cthe Cabinet member most vulnerable to a congressional probe under a Democratic majority in January.\u201d\n\nWhich probably helps explain why he\u2019s reportedly working on an exit strategy.\n\nPolitico reported this week that Zinke is not only eyeing a possible departure from the Trump administration, he\u2019s also \u201creached out\u201d to Fox News about a possible job with the Republican network.\n\nAs for his boss, a reporter asked Donald Trump this morning if he\u2019s going to fire Zinke. \u201cNo,\u201d the president replied. \u201cI\u2019m going to look into any complaints\u2026.

So he\u2019s doing a report. He wasn\u2019t Senate-confirmed. Whitaker was Senate-confirmed. [\u2026] \u201cMueller was not Senate-confirmed. Why didn\u2019t they get him Senate-confirmed? He should have been Senate-confirmed\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me about Whitaker. Don\u2019t tell me about Whitaker, because Mueller was not Senate-confirmed.\u201d\n\nOh dear.\n\nFirst, Robert Mueller was not confirmed by the Senate because special counsels are named by the Justice Department. Under current law, this is not a Senate-confirmed position. It\u2019s like asking why the White House chief of staff was never confirmed by senators; there is no process in place for such a move.\n\nSecond, this is not \u201ca big complaint people have.\u201d Aside from sporadic op-eds in conservative media, few have pointed to this as an area of concern.\n\nThird, in the hypothetical world in which the Senate confirms special counsels, Mueller wouldn\u2019t have faced any meaningful opposition. Trump\u2019s suggestion was that \u201cthey\u201d \u2013 I have no idea who \u201cthey\u201d refers to \u2013 bypassed the confirmation process to obscure Mueller\u2019s unnamed problems. In reality, the special counsel enjoys broad, bipartisan respect.\n\nAnd finally, there\u2019s Trump\u2019s assertion that Matthew Whitaker \u201cwas Senate-confirmed.\u201d Actually, Whitaker was confirmed as a federal prosecutor 14 years ago. This does not mean he was confirmed to a high-ranking post at the Department of Justice, where he could make the transition to acting A.G.\n\nAs has become obvious over the last couple of days, legal experts believe that in order to serve as attorney general, even temporarily, an official needs to have been confirmed by the Senate. Whitaker wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe funny thing is, Trump seemed to realize this question was coming, and this was the answer he came up with.

The Washington Post reported:\n\nFor eight years, Republicans waged a war against Barack Obama\u2019s health-care law, holding dozens of repeal votes, filing lawsuits and branding it a dangerous government takeover. On Wednesday, they effectively surrendered. The day after crushing midterm election losses handed Democrats control of the House, GOP leaders signaled they had no appetite to make another go at shredding the signature accomplishment of Obama\u2019s presidency anytime soon.\n\nMcConnell specifically told reporters, \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty obvious, the Democratic House is not going to be interested in that,\u201d referring to possible ACA repeal.\n\nThe Senate Republican leader added that lawmakers could tackle health care policy \u201con a bipartisan basis.\u201d\n\nI know better than to expect such an outcome, but that\u2019s not crazy. Congress could, in theory, approve some fairly obvious and non-ideological fixes to the current system, which would help consumers, strengthen markets, and be politically popular.\n\nBut putting pipe dreams aside, one of the major questions in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 elections was how quickly Republicans, controlling all of the levers of federal power, would tear down the Affordable Care Act. In the immediate aftermath of the 2018 elections, those concerns are now gone.\n\nThis is not to say the broader threats are over. As we discussed the other day, the Trump administration will still take steps to further undermine \u201cObamacare,\u201d and a Republican judge in Texas is poised to try to gut the law any day now.\n\nBut at a minimum, the public won\u2019t have to spend the next two years wondering whether Congress will strip families of their health security.", "Casey Gerald: My book is memoir and history of US 12:47", "The Democratic wave in the House continues copied!\n\nThe Cook Political Report's Dave Wasserman breaks down the results of the 2018 midterms and the panel discusses the Democratic wave at the state and federal levels.\n\nRead More", "Ben Rhodes, a leading national security adviser in Barack Obama\u2019s White House, asked a good tongue-in-cheek question this morning: \u201cAnyone seen any breathless television or front page updates on whether the Operation Formerly Known As Operation Faithful Patriot has repelled the invasion of the United States of America?\u201d\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the \u201cOperation Faithful Patriot\u201d label, it was the name the Trump administration gave to Donald Trump\u2019s recently launched military mission at the U.S./Mexico border. The day after the midterm elections, however, military officials, without explanation, decided a name change was in order. A Pentagon spokesperson told NBC News that the operation will now simply be referred to as \u201cborder support.\u201d\n\nThe name-change is emblematic of a larger shift on what was a Republican obsession up until a few days ago. The Washington Post\u2019s Eugene Scott noted yesterday:\n\nBefore the midterm elections, President Trump crossed the nation warning those attending his rallies of the oncoming threat of about 7,000 Central American migrants who are traveling through Mexico to seek asylum in the United States.

Matt Whitaker, whom Trump appointed as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement official this week, is a rather ridiculous choice. We are, after all, talking about a shamelessly partisan loyalist, with a strange, far-right worldview, and with close ties to a witness who\u2019s testified in an ongoing federal investigation.\n\nWhitaker has bashed the federal courts. He\u2019s condemned an investigation he\u2019s now overseeing \u2013 and won\u2019t recuse himself from, despite calls from 18 state attorneys general. He\u2019s already decided what the outcome of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe should be. He\u2019s perhaps best known for having advised suspected con artists.\n\nComplicating matters, Matthew Whitaker is the first attorney general \u2013 acting or permanent \u2013 to ever hold the position without having been confirmed to the Justice Department by the Senate. Many experts have made a very credible case that the president\u2019s appointment of Whitaker is plainly illegal.\n\nThe bottom line is unavoidable: this \u201ccrackpot\u201d has no business overseeing the Justice Department of a global superpower.\n\nAll of which raises the question of how the president chose Whitaker for the position in the first place.\n\nCNN had this interesting report yesterday:\n\nIt was not widely known among White House staff that he\u2019d commented repeatedly on the special counsel\u2019s investigation in interviews and on television \u2013 which is ironic given that this is what drew President Donald Trump to him and raises continued questions over the depth of the administration\u2019s vetting process. Sam Clovis, a 2016 Trump campaign national chairman who has close ties to Whitaker, encouraged him to get a regular commentary gig on cable television to get Trump\u2019s attention, according to friends Whitaker told at the time. Whitaker was hired as a CNN legal commentator last year for several months before leaving the role in September 2017 to head to the Justice Department.\n\nTrump may not rely on intelligence reports, but he does rely heavily on his remote control. In this administration, the key to acquiring power and influence is appearing on the president\u2019s television \u2013 and saying what Trump wants to hear.\n\nIndeed, much of the pushback against Whitaker is predicated on the obvious fact that he\u2019s not qualified to oversee the Justice Department, even on a temporary basis. But in this White House, qualifications are irrelevant \u2013 a fact Trump has made clear over and over again.\n\nIt\u2019s very easy to believe the White House did no meaningful vetting of Whitaker before the president made him acting attorney general because this White House doesn\u2019t seem to do meaningful vetting of practically anyone.\n\nThe result is a series of fiascos like this one.", "Ohio's governor-elect plots the way forward copied!\n\nOhio Governor-elect Mike DeWine joins Morning Joe to discuss his win over Democrat Richard Cordray and his plan for Ohio's health care.\n\nRead More", "Joe: Scott, Rubio are just saying 'only count our votes' copied!\n\nRepublican Florida Gov.
