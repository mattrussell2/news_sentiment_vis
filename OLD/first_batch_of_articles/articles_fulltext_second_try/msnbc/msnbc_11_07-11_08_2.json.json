TRUMP: Well, look, as I have told you, they\u2019re under audit. They have been for a long time. They\u2019re extremely complex. People wouldn\u2019t understand them. They\u2019re done by among the biggest and best law firms in the country. Same thing with the accounting firms. The accountants are \u2013 a very, very larger, powerful firm, from the standpoint of respect. Highly respected. Big firm. A great law firm. You know it very well. They do these things; they put them in. But people don\u2019t understand tax returns.\n\nHe went on for a while, reflecting on the greatness of his business ventures, the complexity of his tax materials, and the difficulties mere mortals would have in trying to comprehend the documents. He ultimately said he\u2019d consider releasing the returns at a later date.\n\nEventually, the reporter was able to ask, by way of a follow-up question, \u201cSo that means that if the audit is still on, you will not turn over the tax returns, or you\u2019ll fight to block it?\u201d\n\nTrump replied, \u201cWhen it\u2019s under audit \u2013 no, nobody would. Nobody turns over a return when it\u2019s under audit, okay?\u201d\n\nWell, no, I\u2019m not sure it is okay.\n\nFirst, Trump has promised disclosure for quite a while, but for reasons the White House has never fully explained, he\u2019s never followed through.\n\nSecond, every president since Watergate has had his tax returns audited automatically. Trump\u2019s predecessors, however, didn\u2019t use this as excuse for unexplained secrecy. (Barack Obama, for example, posted his tax returns online for the public to review.)\n\nThird, his preoccupation with the materials\u2019 complexity is irrelevant. Even if the returns are as complicated as Trump claims, there are plenty of tax experts who could review the documents and help the public understand them. It\u2019s not a legitimate excuse to justify the kind of secrecy no modern president has insisted upon.\n\nA fight over this is going to be tough to avoid in the coming months. The Washington Post reported overnight, \u201cRep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), expected to become the chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee once his party retakes power in January, plans to insist Trump voluntarily release his tax returns, he said in an interview.

Several hundred people were inside the venue, which was hosting a \u201ccollege country night\u201d for students, when Ian David Long, 28, walked inside and opened fire, police said.

Jim Himes told CNN. Himes called for Congress to take up some of the measures that have been implemented in Connecticut like an assault weapons ban, but acknowledged the divided Congress makes the likelihood of any legislation becoming law much more remote.\n\nThat last point is obviously a relevant detail.

Some GOP members of Congress and prominent Republican media figures have spoken openly in recent months about government regulation of social media as if they were \u201cpublic utilities.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump, who loves nothing more than embracing conspiracy theories that make him look like a victim, has been only too pleased to endorse the underlying idea, and he\u2019s toyed publicly with the idea of government regulation. The topic came up briefly at yesterday\u2019s White House press conference.\n\nQ: You expressed some concerns about social media companies unfairly censoring conservatives during the election. Do you anticipate working with Democrats to regulate these companies, or are you satisfied with the way things are? TRUMP: I would \u2014 I would do that. Yeah. I would look at that very seriously. I think it\u2019s a serious problem. At the same time, you start getting into speech; that\u2019s a very dangerous problem. That could be the beginning. So it\u2019s very dangerous. Believe it or not, I\u2019m one that really likes free speech. A lot of people don\u2019t understand that. But I am a big believer. And when you start regulating, a lot of bad things can happen. But I would certainly talk to the Democrats if they want to do that. And I think they do want to do that.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot wrong with this, but it was those last few words that stood out as especially striking. The president believes Democrats want government regulation of social media? I\u2019m obviously not in a position to speak with authority as to what Democratic policymakers are prepared to negotiate with the White House about, but I\u2019m aware of zero Dems who\u2019ve expressed even passing interest in this.\n\nAt the same press conference, a reporter asked about funding for Trump\u2019s dream of a giant wall along the U.S./Mexico border. The president insisted, \u201cLook, I speak to Democrats all the time. They agree that a wall is necessary. Wall is necessary. And as you know, we\u2019re building the wall. We\u2019ve started.\u201d\n\nPutting aside the fact that the administration hasn\u2019t \u201cstarted\u201d building a wall \u2013 this is one of Trump\u2019s favorite lies \u2013 the number of Democrats who believe a wall \u201cis necessary\u201d is effectively zero.\n\nThe larger point, of course, is the focus on a group of folks Bloomberg News recently described as \u201canonymous validators\u201d \u2013 groups of people, none of whom the president is willing to identify, whom we\u2019re supposed to believe secretly agree with Trump about his agenda.\n\nA couple of months ago, the president said \u201ceven Democrats agree\u201d with him that the entire Russia scandal has been \u201cdiscredited.\u201d At the same time, Trump also said Democrats disagree privately with surveillance of Carter Page, the president\u2019s former Kremlin-linked foreign policy adviser. And for good measure, Trump said Dems also believe it was \u201cvery unfair\u201d for former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from the investigation into the Russia scandal.\n\nAs of yesterday, Trump now wants us to believe that Democrats are also with him on a border wall and government regulation of social media.\n\nIn the president\u2019s imagination, these people apparently exist. But for those looking for them in the real world, I\u2019d recommend not looking too hard.", "There is no consensus about the precise definition of a \u201cwave\u201d election, so there\u2019s been a fair amount of debate since Tuesday night about whether Democratic gains this year meet the standard. Whether the argument is constructive or not is a matter of perspective.\n\nPerhaps there\u2019s another way of looking at this. I put together the above chart showing House losses and gains for the president\u2019s party by midterm cycle since 1914 (the first midterm cycle in which the House had 435 members). Red columns point to years in which the White House was held by a Republican, blue columns point to years in which the president was a Democrat.\n\nResults from this year are still coming into focus, of course, which makes this a little tricky. As of this morning, most news outlets show Democrats with a net gain of 29 or so seats, but FiveThirtyEight projects Dems will end up with a net gain of 37, so I went with that for now.\n\nLet\u2019s also talk a bit about averages. Between 1914 and 2014, the president\u2019s party lost an average of about 30 House seats in midterm elections. If we narrow the focus to midterms since World War II, the average is about 26. Since Watergate, the average is 23.\n\nIf we look only at a president\u2019s first midterm cycle \u2013 in other words, after a president has been in office for two years, as opposed to six \u2013 the average between 1914 and 2014 is nearly 33 seats. If we look only at Republican presidents, the average is about 27 seats.\n\nWith these metrics in mind, 2018 doesn\u2019t look great for Trump\u2019s GOP.\n\nThis year\u2019s Republican losses, barring major surprises in the final tallies, are higher than the historical average and the worst for a GOP president since the 1974 midterms in the aftermath of Watergate.\n\nThe exceedingly Republican-friendly Senate landscape notwithstanding, it\u2019s tough to see this as anything but a significant setback for the president and his party.", "Dem sees areas where both parties can work together copied!\n\nRep.

After Donald Trump tapped then-Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) to lead the Department of Health and Human Services early last year, there was a special election to fill the vacancy.\n\nOn paper, it didn\u2019t look like it\u2019d be an especially interesting contest: Democrats were running a young, first-time candidate against a Republican who\u2019d already been elected to statewide office. This was a red district, in a red state, which hadn\u2019t elected a Democrat \u2013 or even seen a competitive race \u2013 since the 1970s. Before Tom Price, it\u2019s a district Newt Gingrich held for many years.\n\nJon Ossoff (D), however, did better than expected, losing the special election to Karen Handel by less than four points. Regardless, Republicans crowed: the White House\u2019s Kellyanne Conway wrote on Twitter soon after, \u201cLaughing my #Ossoff.\u201d\n\nA year and a half later, I guess she\u2019s not laughing anymore.\n\nPart of what makes Lucy McBath\u2019s victory notable is the degree to which it represents Democratic success in suburban districts this cycle, but let\u2019s not overlook the significance of McBath\u2019s background. New York magazine explained:\n\nMcBath, a former Delta Airlines flight attendant, turned to activism after her son\u2019s death. Jordan Davis, 17, was parked at a Jacksonville gas station the day after Thanksgiving five years ago when a white man named Michael Dunn began complaining about the loud music Davis and his friends were playing. An argument ensued, and Dunn drew a handgun and fired ten bullets into their vehicle, killing Davis. He was later convicted on three counts of attempted murder and sentenced to life in prison, but won a mistrial on the most serious charge, first-degree murder, due to jurors\u2019 interpretation of Florida\u2019s notorious \u201cstand your ground\u201d law. \u201cI had never really heard of that law other than the Trayvon Martin case,\u201d McBath told me in 2015. \u201cMost definitely, now that has completely changed. My learning curve has gone straight up.\u201d\n\nMcBath quickly devoted much of her life to advocating for policies to reduce gun violence.

With 99 percent of the votes in the state tallied, Tester led Rosendale 49.1 percent to 48 percent with Libertarian Party candidate Rick Breckenridge getting 2.9 percent.\n\nThe president has reason to be pleased with Republicans expanding their majority in the Senate, but I have a hunch the outcome of the Montana race stings.\n\nThat\u2019s because Trump made this one personal.\n\nAfter the Ronny Jackson fiasco, the president made little effort to hide his personal passion to destroy Tester.

And he just happened to blurt this out in response to a question at a press conference?\n\nI suppose anything\u2019s possible, but I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and argue that he\u2019s making this up.\n\nPart of the problem is that there is no way to fully resolve the debate. But the other part of this is the nagging realization that Trump\u2019s secret plans never seem to pan out.\n\nAs a candidate, for example, Trump assured voters he had a secret plan to defeat ISIS, which he\u2019d only share after the election. It turned out to be a rather weak con: once in office, the president asked U.S. military leaders to come with a plan for him, and they came back with a strategy that looks an awful lot like Barack Obama\u2019s plan.\n\nA few months after taking office, the president suggested he also had a secret plan to resolve the fight with North Korea. That doesn\u2019t appear to be working out especially well, either.\n\nNow Trump has a secret solution to the abortion debate? I\u2019d recommend keeping expectations low.", "Dems must practice responsible oversight: Rep. Ryan copied!\n\nRep.

Under normal circumstances, the post would be temporarily filled by a deputy attorney general who\u2019d have the relevant experience and the benefit of having been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nAs Rachel explained on the show last night, Trump chose a very different course.\n\nWith Jeff Sessions now out as attorney general, President Donald Trump\u2019s choice to fill his shoes, at least temporarily, is in the position to have a significant impact on the scope of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. Matthew Whitaker, who has served as Session\u2019s chief of staff since late 2017, has been tapped to become acting attorney general and will therefore take over the role of overseeing Mueller\u2019s probe from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nThe game of musical chairs at the DOJ may seem like bureaucratic trivia. It\u2019s not. To fully appreciate the scope of the dilemma, it\u2019s important to understand who Matt Whitaker is.\n\nAfter serving as a U.S. Attorney during the Bush/Cheney era, Whitaker more recently was basically a professional pundit who appeared on television quite a bit \u2013 it\u2019s probably how Trump came to learn of his work \u2013 where he was a frequent and harsh critic of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the Russia scandal.\n\nIn fact, Whitaker went so far as to call the probe, in Trump-esque language, \u201cMueller\u2019s lynch mob.\u201d\n\nIn one especially memorable TV appearance, Whitaker described a scenario to CNN in which Sessions would be replaced, and his successor would reduce the special counsel\u2019s office\u2019s budget \u201cso low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\u201d\n\nAs of last night, Whitaker now oversees the Mueller investigation.\n\nThere are all kinds of reasons to be concerned about Whitaker\u2019s qualifications and record. He is, after all, a shamelessly partisan loyalist, with a strange, far-right worldview, and with close ties to a witness who\u2019s testified in the Russia scandal.\n\nIncidentally, Whitaker also helped lead \u201can invention-promotion company that was shut down earlier this year amid a Federal Trade Commission investigation.\u201d\n\nBy any fair measure, Trump\u2019s decision to put this guy in charge of the Justice Department, even on a temporary basis (that could last months), is awfully tough to defend.\n\nBut it\u2019s the threat to the Mueller investigation that\u2019s especially notable in the short term. We\u2019re dealing with a dynamic in which the acting attorney general is responsible for overseeing a probe he spent months publicly condemning. David Laufman, the former chief of the Justice Department\u2019s Counterintelligence Section, told Rachel on the show last night that Whitaker may not have a legal obligation to recuse himself, \u201cbut there is, at a minimum, to put it kindly, a grotesque appearance of a conflict, an appearance of impropriety by virtue of his many statements questioning the legitimacy or the scope of the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\u201d\n\nSeven months ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee easily approved a bipartisan bill to protect Mueller and his investigation from political interference. It\u2019s gathered dust ever since, with Republican leaders insisting that the proposal is unnecessary.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) argued, \u201cRather than waiting for a constitutional crisis, the full Senate should act now.\u201d That was in April.\n\nThe crisis appears much closer now.\n\nAs a procedural matter, Congress could take up the bill during the post-election lame-duck session. As we discussed in September, there\u2019s plenty of time for Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan to do the right thing. It\u2019s simply a matter of political will.", "Trump keeps doubling down on a losing strategy copied!\n\nDuring a Wednesday news conference, the president criticized CNN reporter Jim Acosta and referred to a question from PBS reporter Yamiche Alcindor as 'racist.'

(Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly also gave up his post, though he became White House chief of staff.)\n\nNone of those other members, however, drew Trump\u2019s ire the way Sessions did. Indeed, the attorney general has been at the center of multiple presidential tantrums, including a May 2017 incident in which the president called his attorney general an \u201cidiot\u201d and accused him of \u201cdisloyalty.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, those other cabinet resignations won\u2019t have nearly the impact of Sessions\u2019 departure.\n\nWhile Sessions has not been a good attorney general, he has allowed Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the Russia scandal to proceed without political interference.

As he sees it, vulnerable House Republicans, many of whom represented districts Hillary Clinton won two years ago, ended up losing because they didn\u2019t tie their fortunes to his presidency.\n\nThe idea that these GOP incumbents would\u2019ve lost by larger margins had they cozied up to Trump apparently hasn\u2019t occurred to him.\n\nOf course, the other flaw in the thesis is that plenty of pro-Trump candidates, who welcomed his support and echoed his message, also failed at the ballot box.

That treatment is reserved for more center-right candidates who lost as part of anti-Trump backlash.\n\nPostscript: Trump pointed to Utah\u2019s Mia Love (R) as a candidate who lost, but it\u2019s worth emphasizing that her race hasn\u2019t yet been formally called.

For one thing, it\u2019s not the Senate\u2019s job to investigate the House. For another, the president made it sound as if he\u2019s aware of Democratic wrongdoing, which he\u2019s prepared to overlook as part of some kind of corrupt quid pro quo: if House Dems ignore his scandals, he\u2019ll make sure Republicans ignore theirs.\n\nAt a White House press conference today, Trump elaborated on this:\n\n\u201cThey can play that game, but we can play it better. Because we have a thing called the United States Senate. And a lot of very questionable things were done between leaks of classified information and many other elements that should not have taken place\u2026.

As things stand, Walker apparently lost by 1.2%.\n\n* Exact figures aren\u2019t yet clear, but it looks like turnout in this year\u2019s midterm elections reached record highs.\n\n* The race hasn\u2019t been formally called just yet, but Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R), better known as Vladimir Putin\u2019s favorite congressman, is trailing in his re-election bid.\n\n* In South Carolina\u2019s 1st congressional district, Katie Arrington defeated Rep. Mark Sanford in a Republican primary earlier this year, declaring at the time, \u201cWe are the party of President Donald J. Trump.\u201d Last night, Arrington lost to Joe Cunningham (D) in a district Trump won by 11 points.\n\n* And speaking of red-state surprises, Kendra Horn (D) yesterday upset Rep. Steve Russell (R) in Oklahoma\u2019s 5th congressional district, which Trump won by nearly 14 points two years ago. This was not considered one of the key races to watch.\n\n* A striking statistic: \u201cMore than 100 women were projected to win seats in the House of Representatives, easily shattering the record. Overwhelmingly they were Democrats who helped the party take control of the chamber. Women have never held more than 84 of the 435 seats in the House. With votes still being counted Wednesday morning, 95 had already been declared winners.\u201d", "Veronica Escobar says a woman is right choice to lead new Democrat majority in congress copied!\n\nVeronica Escobar says a woman is the right choice to lead the new Democrat majority in the house after the midterm elections.\n\nRead More", "When one party holds a state\u2019s governor\u2019s office and both of its state legislative chambers, the partisan control is generally known as a \u201ctrifecta.\u201d And in recent years, Republicans have racked up more than a few of them, while Democrats have had very few.\n\nYesterday, that changed.\n\nGoing into Election Day 2018, there were 26 GOP trifectas and just 8 Democratic trifectas. Yesterday, that total went down for Republicans and nearly doubled for Dems. Vox took note of some of the more notable changes for the \u201cblue\u201d team:\n\nIn Colorado, for example, Democrats now control the state Senate and maintained control of the House of Representatives, and Democrat Jared Polis won the governorship, giving the party the \u201ctrifecta\u201d of power in the state. There will also be a Democratic trifecta in New York after the party took back control of the state\u2019s Senate. Democrats have numerically had the majority there already, but for years there had been a group of Democratic senators who had broken off to caucus together and team up with Republicans.\n\nAmong the other new Democratic trifectas are Maine, Illinois, New Mexico, and Nevada. As things stand, the party\u2019s total has gone from 8 before yesterday to 14, including all of the continental West coast.\n\nAnd while Republicans appear to have gained a trifecta in Alaska, the GOP also lost their stronghold in Kansas (where Democrat Laura Kelly won the gubernatorial race), Michigan (where Gretchen Whitmer won the gubernatorial race), Wisconsin (where Tony Evers won the gubernatorial race), and New Hampshire (where Democrats flipped both the state House and state Senate).\n\nThis is about far more than bragging rights and electoral trivia. As Vox\u2019s piece added:\n\nAhead of Election Day, Vox\u2019s Dylan Scott laid out why state legislative elections are so important: They\u2019re crucial for state-level policy debates on issues such as taxes, education, and health care, and they will also be key when officials start redrawing US congressional districts in 2020. Republican gerrymandering has put Democrats at a disadvantage in many states across the country, and Democrats getting more control of state legislatures could help them start to push back. Per Scott: \u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that the 2018 state legislative races \u2013 and then the even more crucial 2020 elections \u2013 will help determine who controls the US House all the way through 2030.\u201d\n\nAnd as notable as the trifectas are, they\u2019re emblematic of significant Democratic gains in state legislatures nationwide. Though votes are still being tallied, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee sent an alert to reporters two hours ago noting that Dems have \u201cregained majorities in seven chambers and flipped 350 seats from red to blue nationwide.\u201d\n\nThis probably won\u2019t be the kind of story that dominates national headlines, but it\u2019s a development that will pay dividends for Democrats for quite a while.", "Women win big in the midterms copied!\n\nWomen were majorly successful in the midterm elections, taking at least 110 Congressional seats between the House and the Senate \u2013 smashing a record.

The most dramatic change occurred in Michigan.\n\nMichigan \u2026 passed a law significantly changing the way the state\u2019s political lines are drawn for congressional and state legislative districts. The amendment will take the power to draw those lines out of the hands of state lawmakers, as the Detroit Free Press explains, and put it into the hands of an independent redistricting commission made up of four Republicans, four Democrats and five people who identify with neither party. The state also approved a wide-ranging amendment that will allow people to register to vote on Election Day and will institute automatic voter registration. It will also allow voters to request an absentee ballot for any reason.\n\nNevada also adopted automatic voter registration, bringing the new total of states with AVR to 16. Yes, that\u2019s only a third of the country, but given that automatic voter registration didn\u2019t exist in any states as recently as three years ago, it\u2019s a progressive reform that\u2019s clearly catching on quickly.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just AVR. Voters in Florida approved a measure to restore voting rights for many with prior felonies. In Kansas, voters rejected the gubernatorial candidacy of Kris Kobach, one of the nation\u2019s voter-suppression pioneers.\n\nIn Colorado and Missouri, voters agreed to overhaul the redistricting process to end gerrymandering. (Utah may have done the same thing, but votes on the state\u2019s Proposition 4 are still being tallied.)\n\nIn Maryland, voters agreed to allow same-day voter registration.\n\nThe news wasn\u2019t all good \u2013 North Carolina approved a voter-ID requirement \u2013 but all things considered, Ari Berman, who covers voting rights for Mother Jones, described this year\u2019s results as the \u201cbest election for voting rights in decades.\u201d", "Ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Democrats weren\u2019t just optimistic because of the polls. They also spent quite a bit of time fiddling with sites like 270 to Win, exploring different scenarios with the electoral college, and concluding that Donald Trump\u2019s path to the White House simply didn\u2019t exist.\n\nAfter all, the Clinton/Kaine ticket could lose several of the battleground states Barack Obama had won at least once \u2013 Florida, Ohio, Iowa, and North Carolina \u2013 and still win the election thanks to the \u201cblue wall\u201d in the Rust Belt.\n\nBefore 2016, in six of the previous six presidential elections, Michigan and Pennsylvania had voted Democratic. In Wisconsin, it was seven of the previous seven. So long as these three states remained in the \u201cblue\u201d column, Hillary Clinton would be the next president.\n\nWe now know, of course, that this didn\u2019t happen. Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin each went \u201cred.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, these same three states appeared to swing back in the other direction.\n\nMichigan: Voters in Michigan elected a Democratic governor, re-elected a Democratic U.S. senator, and picked up enough state Senate seats to end the GOP\u2019s supermajority. Though some votes are still being counted, Democratic candidates also appear to be well positioned in the race for state attorney general and in the closely watched race in the 8th congressional district, which appears set to flip from \u201cred\u201d to \u201cblue.\u201d\n\nPennsylvania: Voters in Pennsylvania re-elected a Democratic governor, re-elected a Democratic U.S. senator, and erased the GOP\u2019s supermajority in the state Senate. Democrats also appear to have flipped four congressional districts in the state from \u201cred\u201d to \u201cblue.\u201d\n\nWisconsin: Voters in Wisconsin elected a Democratic governor (for the first time in a while) and re-elected a Democratic U.S. senator. Though the race hasn\u2019t been called, the Dem also appears to be ahead in the race for state attorney general.\n\nThis is not to say that Trump will necessarily lose these states in two years \u2013 a lot can happen in 24 months \u2013 but if the \u201cblue wall\u201d crumbled in 2016, Democrats took steps to put it back together again in 2018.", "Nelson\u2019s chief of staff says Florida Senate race headed to recount copied!\n\nThe chief of staff for Florida Senator Bill Nelson tells NBC there will be a recount, per state law which requires an automatic recount if there is less than a half percent between the vote totals.

Last week, Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, endorsed a similar strategy.\n\nThat plan is now dead. With Democrats retaking the House majority, the Affordable Care Act had a good day at the ballot box. Republicans may yet be able to undermine the nation\u2019s health care system, but they\u2019ll need to rely on the courts because voters just ended the repeal crusade.\n\nFor health care advocates, that\u2019s just the start of the good news.\n\nThree red states approved Medicaid expansion in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, changes that will potentially cover hundreds of thousands more low-income Americans, NBC News projected. Voters in Utah, Nebraska and Idaho were all expected to pass ballot measures to broaden the federal and state health insurance program, according to NBC.\n\nAll told, as a result of these ballot measures, more than 300,000 low-income Americans are poised to gain health care coverage. The new total of states that have embraced Medicaid expansion through the Affordable Care Act will now grow to 36.\n\nIt gets better: with Democrats winning big in Maine, and Gov. Paul LePage (R) exiting the stage, the future for Medicaid expansion in the state appears bright, and in Kansas, where voters elected a Democratic governor, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see the Sunflower State join the club.\n\nTo be sure, the news wasn\u2019t all good for health care advocates. In Montana, where the tobacco industry spent more than $12 million to defeat a ballot measure, voters apparently rejected a funding mechanism to keep Medicaid expansion going in the red state. Its future in Montana is now uncertain.\n\nBut this was generally the only setback in what was otherwise a very good day for American health care. The challenges aren\u2019t over \u2013 the Trump administration will still try to undermine \u201cObamacare,\u201d and a Republican judge in Texas is poised to try to gut the law \u2013 but health care advocates have reason to celebrate today.", "In the 1994 midterms, Republicans posted huge gains and took control of Congress. Time magazine published a cover image of a powerful, triumphant elephant crushing a donkey, under a headline that called it a \u201cGOP stampede.\u201d\n\nRepublicans had reason to crow at the time: by a 7.1% margin, American voters had backed GOP candidates over Democratic candidates.\n\nNearly a quarter of a century later, Democrats apparently won the House \u201cpopular vote\u201d by 7%.\n\nI realize Republicans, benefiting from a Senate map that was almost comically titled in their favor, are thrilled to see their majority grow in the upper chamber. I can also appreciate why many Democrats were disappointed to see some heartbreaking losses in key contests, especially in Florida.\n\nBut the scope of the House Democratic victories was rather extraordinary. I put together the above chart based on the findings from Princeton\u2019s Sam Wang, who highlighted the popular-vote gap in House races in several recent cycles.\n\nHouse Republicans, for example, had excellent years in 1994 and 2010, but House Democrats kept pace with these tallies.\n\nSome observers will no doubt ask in response, \u201cThen why didn\u2019t Democrats win even more seats?\u201d The answer is a familiar one: between Republican gerrymandering and concentration of Democratic votes in urban areas, the party faced an enormous challenge even trying to take back the House of Representatives.\n\nBut they did anyway.\n\nI\u2019m inclined to skip the debate over whether or not this counts as a \u201cwave.\u201d The term has no specific definition in political science, and the fact that there\u2019s a debate at all reinforces the fact that it\u2019s a subjective matter.\n\nWhat strikes me as the more salient point is that Republicans had all kinds of advantages, including a strong economy and gerrymandered maps, but the GOP got slammed in House races anyway.\n\nAs Vox\u2019s Matt Yglesias explained this morning, \u201cAfter the 2010 midterms, Republicans held the House and the majority of the population lived under GOP governors but they only had 47 senate seats after some disappointing losses. I don\u2019t think people saw that as an ambiguous outcome.\u201d\n\nUpdate: As additional votes have come in, the \u201cpopular vote\u201d has shifted.

The G.O.P.\u2019s House majority is all but doomed, he said. But Mr. Trump was not moved. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what happened.\n\nIf his tweets this morning are any indication, the president appears to be taking a victory lap, due entirely to the fact that Republicans, taking advantage of the most favorable Senate map in American history, expanded their majority in the upper chamber. Trump, at least publicly, considers this year\u2019s midterms a \u201ctremendous success\u201d and a \u201cbig victory\u201d for the GOP.\n\nWhether or not he genuinely believes this is unclear, but if the president is feeling some optimism in the wake of the results, he\u2019s kidding himself.\n\nTo the extent that the White House has a legislative agenda, it is now effectively dead. Making matters worse, rejecting Trump\u2019s far-right proposals isn\u2019t the only way the new Democratic majority in the House is going to make Trump quite miserable.\n\nClose video Democratic control of committees most worrying prospect for Trump Rachel Maddow reviews the litany of investigations of Donald Trump and his administration that have been suppressed by Republicans in control of Congress\u2019s oversight responsibilities, and the avalanche of subpoenas and hearings that would likely result share tweet email save Embed\n\nFor two years, every Trump scandal has been ignored on Capitol Hill. Every Democratic request for a subpoena has been rejected. Any semblance of a traditional constitutional system of checks and balances has disappeared.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent explained last month, \u201cThe basic bargain Republicans have made with the president is that he will keep delivering them right-wing judges and signing bills slashing taxes on the rich and eviscerating the social safety net, so long as Republicans maintain fortress-like protection of Trump from oversight and accountability.\u201d\n\nThe American electorate has severed that deal. The fortress is suddenly missing a wall.\n\nIn May, outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) warned that Democrats might try to hold the president accountable, complete with hearings and subpoenas, if they were rewarded with a majority. On this, he was correct. Soon after, Axios published a list that meticulously previewed \u201cthe investigations Democrats will likely launch if they flip the House.\u201d It included, among other things, scrutiny of Trump\u2019s tax returns.\n\nHad the race for the House gone the other way, that list would\u2019ve gathered dust. It will now instead serve as a blueprint.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the outgoing GOP majority actually made this dynamic worse. As Politico reported two weeks ago, House Republicans changed the chamber\u2019s rules in 2015, allowing committee chairs to issue subpoenas unilaterally, without even consulting the minority party.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans have set the standard and, by God, we\u2019re going to emulate that standard,\u201d Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) told Politico.\n\nAll of which suggests Trump\u2019s free ride is poised to come to an abrupt halt. The president, who\u2019s never been altogether familiar with how governmental institutions work, probably doesn\u2019t realize how good he\u2019s had it. The lesson will likely be brutal.\n\nPostscript: It\u2019s not yet clear how Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the Russia scandal will proceed, or whether there will be a report on his findings. But if there is such a document, it\u2019ll likely be delivered to Congress.\n\nUnder a Republican-led House, that report would be buried and ignored.
