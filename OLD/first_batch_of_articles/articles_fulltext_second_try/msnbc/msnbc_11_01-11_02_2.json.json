Elijah Cummings talks with Rachel Maddow about e-mails that show Donald Trump\u2019s direct role in preventing the FBI from moving to a new building and leaving their old building to likely development as a hotel that would compete with Trump\u2019s. share tweet email save Embed\n\nAs regular readers know , Donald Trump\u2019s keen interest in the FBI\u2019s headquarters has been at the center of an ongoing controversy. Axios reported in July, for example, that there\u2019s been a debate ongoing for quite a while about whether to leave the FBI where it is or relocate the bureau\u2019s headquarters to a nearby suburb. The president is \u201cdead opposed to plans to move it out of D.C.\u201d\n\nAsked for an explanation, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said last month, \u201cThe president wanted to save the government money,\u201d which is why he directly intervened in the project. As the Wall Street Journal reports today, Sanders\u2019 argument wasn\u2019t true.\n\nNew documents suggest the Trump administration was aware that its decision to keep the FBI headquarters in downtown Washington, D.C., would cost more than a competing proposal to relocate to the suburbs, contradicting public assertions from the White House that it wanted to save taxpayers money. A newly released email exchange shows that Andrew Abrams, deputy associate director of the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, attempting to prepare Emily Murphy, chief of the General Services Administration, for testimony before Congress about the FBI headquarters. In the email, Mr. Abrams says the toughest question Ms. Murphy could receive is, \u201cHow is this a good deal for taxpayers?\u201d The email doesn\u2019t dispute that the proposal to keep the facility in Washington would cost more and be less secure than relocating to the suburbs in Virginia or Maryland.\n\nThe information was obtained by House Democrats, several of whom wrote a letter to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly today, demanding additional information.\n\nGiven the last two years, I can appreciate why a \u201cSanders lies about a thing\u201d story may seem uninteresting, but in this case, don\u2019t be too quick to dismiss the revelation. We\u2019re talking about a controversy that points to possible presidential corruption, which now also appears to involve multiple officials who haven\u2019t told the truth.\n\nLet\u2019s back up for a minute to review how we reached this point, because there\u2019s a controversy here that could pose meaningful trouble for the White House.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with D.C., the Federal Bureau of Investigation is currently located along Pennsylvania Avenue, about four blocks east of the White House.\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed, it\u2019s also about a block from the Trump International Hotel, which the president still owns and profits from. If the current FBI headquarters were redeveloped in its existing space, it\u2019d benefit Trump\u2019s investment. For that matter, keeping the bureau in its current home would guarantee that a competing hotel wouldn\u2019t go in at that location.\n\nAll of which makes it interesting that the Trump White House was directly involved in the talks about plans for the building.\n\nCongressional Democrats recently released materials on a Jan. 24, 2018, meeting at which Trump spoke directly with General Services Administrator Emily Murphy about abandoning the plan to relocate the FBI to a larger campus in a nearby suburb.\n\nIn a series of emails in the days that followed, the GSA confirmed that the relocation plan was dead, evidently at the president\u2019s direction. A top GSA official, Brennan Hart, wrote in a Jan 28 email that the FBI project \u201cis a demolition/new construction per the president\u2019s instructions.\u201d\n\nThree months later, during a congressional hearing, Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) asked the GSA\u2019s Emily Murphy, \u201cTo your knowledge, was the president or anyone else at the White House involved in those discussions, either with your predecessors, people you\u2019re working with now, or yourself?\u201d\n\nMurphy replied, \u201cThe direction that we got came from the FBI. It was the FBI that directed to GSA as to what its requirements would be. We obviously did coordinate, given that it is a substantial budget request, we coordinated that request with OMB to provide for funding but the requirements were generated by the FBI.\u201d\n\nMurphy did not, however, mention the White House meetings as part of her answer.\n\nAnd it now appears she\u2019s not the only member of Team Trump who\u2019s been careless with the truth about this project. The White House knew that Trump\u2019s preferred approach would cost American taxpayers more money, but (a) the president insisted that officials follow his wishes anyway; and (b) Sanders told reporters the opposite.\n\nWith each new revelation, the controversy looks a little more serious.", "Washington Post CEO on Jamal Khashoggi copied!\n\nWashington Post CEO and Publisher Fred Ryan speaks at the 2018 Courage in Journalism Awards about contributor Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nRead More", "Rehema Ellis talks to volunteers working to maximize African American voter turnout in Mississippi copied!\n\nDemocratic organizers are hoping they can replicate what happened in Alabama last year to get another win in a deep red state.

I do try \u2026 and I always want to tell the truth,\u201d Trump said in an interview with ABC News. \u201cWhen I can, I tell the truth. And sometimes it turns out to be where something happens that\u2019s different or there\u2019s a change, but I always like to be truthful.\u201d\n\nNote Trump\u2019s choice of words, which seemed to reflect an awkward realization that he\u2019s not considered to be an honest person. The president could\u2019ve simply said, \u201cI always tell the truth,\u201d but he didn\u2019t.\n\nWe were instead treated to a series of caveats: Trump \u201ctries\u201d to tell the truth. He \u201cwants\u201d to tell the truth. He \u201clikes\u201d to be truthful.\n\nMaybe he ought to \u201ctry\u201d harder. The Washington Post reported today:\n\nIn the first nine months of his presidency, Trump made 1,318 false or misleading claims, an average of five a day. But in the seven weeks leading up the midterm elections, the president made 1,419 false or misleading claims \u2014 an average of 30 a day. [\u2026] The flood of presidential misinformation has picked up dramatically as the president has barnstormed across the country, holding rallies with his supporters. Each of those rallies usually yields 35 to 45 suspect claims. But the president often has tacked on interviews with local media (in which he repeats the same false statements) and gaggles with the White House press corps before and after his trips.\n\nWhen it comes to the Washington Post\u2019s database of the president\u2019s false claims, Trump broke his own record in September with 599 false and misleading claims. He then broke his own record again in October, nearly doubling that total.\n\nNow, some might argue that the comparison to previous months isn\u2019t entirely fair since the president has been talking a lot more as the midterm elections draw closer. But that\u2019s not much of a defense: the more Trump speaks, the more Trump lies.\n\nThe reporter who spoke to Trump this week about his veracity was ABC News\u2019 Jonathan Karl, who in May asked White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, \u201c[W]hen the president so often says things that turn out not to be true, when the president and the White House show what appears to be a blatant disregard for the truth, how are the American people to trust or believe what is said here and what is said by the president?\u201d\n\nNeither Trump nor anyone on his team have ever answered that question in a satisfactory way.", "Trump administration reimposes Iran sanctions lifted in 2015 nuclear deal copied!\n\nThe sanctions cover Iran's shipping, financial and energy sectors.

With some members of the president\u2019s cabinet having resigned in disgrace, another facing all kinds of accusations of wrongdoing, and another still facing the prospect of a criminal investigation, it\u2019s tough to blame reform advocates.\n\nBut some in the White House apparently disagree. As CNN reported, National Security Adviser John Bolton spoke at the Hamilton Society yesterday in DC, where he argued that current ethics rules are a deterrent to public service.\n\nBolton said \u201cthings have gotten more bureaucratic, harder to get things done\u201d since he served under President George H.W. Bush in the 1990s and blamed the difficulty, in part, on the \u201cexcessive nature of the so-called ethics checks.\u201d \u201cIf you were designing a system to discourage people from coming into government, you would do it this way,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cThat risks building up a priestly class\u201d of government employees, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s really depressing to see,\u201d Bolton said of the bureaucratic red tape.\n\nI generally find it difficult to take John Bolton\u2019s arguments seriously, but this seems like especially weak tea.

Now, we did have two maniacs stop our momentum that was incredible, because for seven days, nobody talked about the election to stop the tremendous momentum.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the synagogue and pipe bomb attacks, the president found some people to feel sorry for: himself and his party.\n\nPerhaps realizing that he was prioritizing party politics over people, the president quickly added that \u201cwe don\u2019t care about momentum,\u201d before immediately making the case that he cares deeply about momentum: \u201cBut it did nevertheless stop a certain momentum. And now the momentum is picking up. And it\u2019s picked up based on common sense. It\u2019s picked up based on strong borders\u2026.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t care about momentum, but have I mentioned how important momentum is?\n\nCircling back to our coverage from last week, if a major news organization had published a report, quoting anonymous White House insiders, saying that Trump is whining behind the scenes about pipe bombs and the deadliest attack on Jewish Americans in the history of the United States interfering with Republicans\u2019 election messaging, it would\u2019ve made the president look like an awful, petulant child, more concerned with politics than national security.\n\nBut as it turns out, we don\u2019t need a behind-the-scenes account: Trump keeps sharing this sentiment in public.\n\nAnd by all appearances, that\u2019s largely because the president seems to enjoy feeling sorry for himself. During the fight over Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court nomination, the president pointed to himself as a victim. When the public learned of a higher official death toll in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria, Trump said researchers were simply trying to make him look bad. While railing against federal law enforcement earlier this year, the president endorsed the idea that he\u2019s \u201cbeen victimized by the Obama Administration.\u201d\n\nAs a Washington Post report put it in June, \u201cIn President Trump\u2019s telling, which can often be more imaginary than real, he is a victim \u2013 a long-suffering, tormented victim.\u201d\n\nThe self-pity was certainly on display last night.

But as the New York Times noted, the president went after Stacey Abrams yesterday with phrasing he doesn\u2019t often use.\n\nPresident Trump disparaged Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia, in ambiguous and unusually personal terms on Thursday, warning that \u201cher past\u201d left her \u201cnot qualified to be the governor.\u201d Mr. Trump did not elaborate and offered no evidence for his assertion, which seemed to be a potential preview of the political message he will deliver on Sunday, two days ahead of the election, at a Georgia rally for Brian Kemp, Ms. Abrams\u2019s Republican rival. But the decision of the president, who has been criticized for inflammatory language, to invoke Ms. Abrams\u2019s background so broadly was a distinct escalation in his attacks on her bid to become the first black woman to be elected governor in the United States.\n\nThe comments came on the heels of a recent tweet in which Trump described the Georgia Democrat as \u201ctotally unqualified.\u201d\n\nAccording to the comprehensive Trump Twitter Archive, Trump has called exactly one person \u2013 literally, just one \u2013 \u201cunqualified\u201d since becoming president, and it\u2019s Stacey Abrams.\n\nThere is a certain irony to the attack. After all Donald Trump, up until quite recently, was a television personality, who\u2019d never served a day in public office, who spent much of his life benefiting from illegal handouts from his father, and who failed repeatedly as a hapless businessman.\n\nPerhaps he\u2019s the wrong guy to start offering evaluations about who is and isn\u2019t \u201cqualified\u201d for high-ranking elected office.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a curious line of criticism because it\u2019s wrong.\n\nAbrams has 11 years of experience as a state lawmaker, and she\u2019s held a legislative leadership post for roughly half that time. She\u2019s also a Yale-educated attorney who\u2019s had success in the public and private sectors.\n\nSure, she\u2019s never been the host of a reality-TV program, but by any sane measure, Abrams has the necessary qualifications to be governor.\n\nAnd yet, there\u2019s Trump, making the opposite case for reasons he hasn\u2019t explained.

The clip itself features on-screen text that tells views, \u201cDemocrats let him into our country. Democrats let him stay. Who else would Democrats let in?\u201d\n\nAnd while many marveled at the ugly demagoguery \u2013 even a handful of Republicans said they were disgusted \u2013 it wasn\u2019t long before we realized that Trump\u2019s video wasn\u2019t just based on racism; it was also based on lies. The Daily Beast explained yesterday:\n\nBracamontes was first deported to his native Mexico in 1997, during the Clinton administration, after he was busted selling drugs. But, according to U.S. Immigration officials, Bracamontes managed return to the United States by 2001, when he was deported a second time for being in the country illegally. That was during the first year of the Bush administration. Bracamontes was back in America again by 2002.\n\nIn other words, a Democratic administration deported him, but he re-entered the country under a Republican administration.\n\nComplicating matters, the Sacramento Bee reported yesterday that Bracamontes was also arrested on drug charges in Arizona in the 1990s, but he was released by then-Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio\u2019s office \u201cfor reasons unknown.\u201d\n\nArpaio, of course, is a far-right Republican, a close ally of Donald Trump, and the recipient of a highly dubious presidential pardon.\n\nThe point isn\u2019t to characterize Bracamontes\u2019 many crimes as a Republican failure. The truth is, he entered and exited the country several times, as the Washington Post noted, he was \u201cdeported under both Democratic and Republican presidents.\u201d There\u2019s no reason to see this through some kind of partisan-food-fight lens.\n\nRather, the point is that by trying present this through a partisan-food-fight lens, Donald Trump apparently found it necessary to lie to the public.\n\nIn case this isn\u2019t obvious, when we\u2019re dealing with overt racism, fact-checking the details isn\u2019t the principal concern. But the fact that Trump lied in the video reflects a degree of contempt for his own followers.\n\nThe president seems to think the Republican base will mindlessly swallow any nonsensical red meat he throws its way, especially with only a few days remaining before Election Day.

Evidently not. The Washington Post reported on the latest comments from Larry Kudlow, the director of Donald Trump\u2019s National Economic Council.\n\n\u201cMy view is a federal minimum wage is a terrible idea. A terrible idea,\u201d Kudlow said at a Washington Post Live event, adding that raising it would \u201cdamage\u201d small businesses by forcing them to face higher payroll costs. Kudlow later called the idea of hiking the federal minimum wage \u201csilly.\u201d [\u2026] Kudlow appeared to also oppose minimum wages at the state and local levels, citing conservative arguments that it constrains business growth by adding to their costs. But he said the federal government shouldn\u2019t interfere. \u201cI would argue against state and local, but that\u2019s up to the states and localities,\u201d Kudlow said.\n\nIn other words, the top voice on economic policy in the White House doesn\u2019t believe the current minimum wage should be $7.25; he thinks it should be zero.\n\nAnd while this is a fairly radical position \u2013 most Americans believe the minimum wage should both exist and be higher than it is now \u2013 it\u2019s also in line with what Donald Trump had to say during the 2016 campaign. During one especially memorable Fox News interview, Bill O\u2019Reilly noted there \u201chas to be a federal minimum wage.\u201d Trump replied, \u201cThere doesn\u2019t have to be.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, let\u2019s not look past the electoral context of Kudlow\u2019s latest comments.\n\nWe are, after all, five days out from the midterm elections, and a whole lot of working families are going to choose which party best represents their interests.

[\u2026] But President Donald Trump has never been cowed by elite opinion\u2026.\n\nAbout a day later, the New York Times ran an unrelated article on the right\u2019s vilification of George Soros, which it said has \u201cmoved from the fringes to the mainstream.\u201d Conspiracy theories about the Hungarian-American financier \u201cwere initially confined to the anti-Semitic fringe,\u201d the piece added, but they\u2019re now peddled by plenty of Republicans \u2013 including the president of the United States.\n\nAnd while stories like these deserve to be considered as notable in their own right, it\u2019s also worth appreciating just how frequently we\u2019re confronted with these kinds of stories.

Jeff Sessions was considered \u201ca fringe figure\u201d in GOP politics, but Trump made him the attorney general. During his congressional career, Mike Pence earned a reputation as something of a lawmaker on the radical periphery, with a voting record well to the right of House members such as Michele Bachmann and Louie Gohmert, but Trump chose him to be vice president.\n\nSome figures from Breitbart News \u201clabored on the fringes\u201d right up until they secured jobs in the White House. Stephen Miller \u201cspent years on the political fringe\u201d before he started shaping the sitting president\u2019s agenda. Mainstream Republicans spent years keeping Southern Baptist pastor Robert Jeffress at arms\u2019 length, but he\u2019s now a popular figure in the West Wing.\n\nTrump himself was seen as a fringe political figure, best known for championing a racist conspiracy theory, right up until he was elected president.\n\nFiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nate Silver published an analysis awhile back that explained, \u201cThe most conservative Republicans in the House 25 or 30 years ago would be among the most liberal members now.\u201d In other words, if you were following national politics in the 1990s, you could\u2019ve found plenty of members of Congress who would\u2019ve fairly been described as very conservative \u2013 but by today\u2019s standards, those identical individuals constitute the GOP\u2019s \u201cmoderate\u201d wing.\n\nAnd that necessarily suggests that those who were dismissed as fringe extremists a generation ago have filled the vacuum and now represent the Republican Party\u2019s conservative wing, which dominates the party at the national level.\n\nThose who\u2019ve made the transition from the GOP fringe to the GOP mainstream have brought their ideas with them.

This may well cause new trouble for Sen. Jon Tester (D).", "Casey Gerald: My book is memoir and history of US 12:47", "Some racist ads are subtle, relying on innuendo and nuance. Some racist ads are more overt.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday released a racially divisive political ad that blames Democrats for allowing an undocumented immigrant who was convicted of killing police officers to stay in the U.S. The 53-second video, which was pinned to the top of Trump\u2019s Twitter feed on Thursday, refers to Luis Bracamontes, who was convicted of, and given the death penalty earlier this year for killing two California police officers in 2014.\n\nBracamontes had already been twice deported from the United States to Mexico, but he returned illegally. The ad features the convicted killer bragging about his heinous crimes and mocking his victims.\n\nFor Donald Trump, this is a partisan matter. \u201cIt is outrageous what the Democrats are doing to our Country,\u201d the president said in a tweet prompting the ad. The video itself features text that tells views, \u201cDemocrats let him into our country. Democrats let him stay. Who else would Democrats let in?\u201d\n\nTo the extent that reality has any meaning, Democrats neither let Luis Bracamontes into the United States not allowed him to stay.\n\nBut the dishonesty is not at the top of the list of what makes the video offensive. The point, obviously, is the president\u2019s effort to divide and terrify. The tool he\u2019s chosen to exploit is a video of a Mexican murderer, which is featured alongside random footage of people who might be Hispanic marching and trying to overcome gates.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said of the video, \u201cThis is just a new low in campaigning. It\u2019s sickening.\u201d In a tweet directed at Trump. Al Cardenas, the former chair of the Florida Republican Party, wrote, \u201cThis ad, and your full approval of it, will condemn you and your bigoted legacy forever in the annals of America\u2019s history books.\u201d\n\n\u200fI\u2019ve seen plenty of people compare Trump\u2019s new video to the \u201cWillie Horton\u201d ad from 1988. It\u2019s a valid comparison, but I tend to think this new ad is worse.\n\nFor those who need a refresher, Michael Dukakis (D) was leading George H.W. Bush (R) in the presidential race 30 years ago, prompting Lee Atwater, Bush\u2019s attack-dog strategist, to go after a furlough program in Dukakis\u2019 home state of Massachusetts. It was a program that allowed William Horton to be released after a murder conviction, and once furloughed, he attacked a woman. (The fact that the Massachusetts program had been created by Dukakis\u2019 predecessor was conveniently ignored.)\n\nThe ad quickly became infamous for its inherent racism, and there are clear parallels to today. In 1988, the Horton ad told voters that Democrats are on the side of a violent black man. In 2018, Trump\u2019s new video is telling voters that Democrats are on the side of a violent Mexican man.\n\nBut 30 years ago, Bush\u2019s team considered the message so toxic that the Republican campaign didn\u2019t want to be directly associated with it. Instead, the ad was launched by \u201cAmericans for Bush\u201d and Lee Atwater falsely claimed he wasn\u2019t involved. (He later expressed regret for his actions.)\n\nThis year, however, Donald Trump doesn\u2019t care. The president isn\u2019t keeping his distance from the racist video; he\u2019s actively promoting it.\n\nThere\u2019s no embarrassment. There\u2019s no shame. There\u2019s only unabashed pride.\n\nAnd remember, this is what Trump is willing to do ahead of the midterm elections. Take a moment to consider what a president lacking in any sense of limits will do ahead of his own re-election bid.\n\nIt\u2019s worth emphasizing that Trump\u2019s ad isn\u2019t really an ad in a traditional sense. It\u2019s 53 seconds \u2013 television commercials are usually 30 or 60 seconds \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t include any of the disclosure text that\u2019s legally required for ads that run on broadcast TV.\n\nIn other words, this is a Trump internet video.\n\nI mention this because I realize that it exists to get attention. In fact, I\u2019ve spent the morning going back and forth, debating whether or not to ignore it, and weighing the costs of giving Trump what he wants: more attention for his racist message.\n\nBut in the end, when the sitting president of the United States peddles racist garbage, it\u2019s news. The public needs to know who their elected leader is, what he wants, and how he intends to get it. When Donald Trump makes his character clear, Americans must not turn away.", "Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect pleads not guilty copied!\n\nPittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect Robert Bowers pleaded not guilty to federal hate crime and other charges.

It was a compelling metaphor: Hawley complained about ambitious politicians running for offices they don\u2019t really care about, only to climb ladders to some higher office.\n\nThe Missouri Republican told voters he actually wanted to serve as state attorney general, and voters believed him, handing the young attorney \u2013 he was just 36 on Election Day 2016 \u2013 an easy win.\n\nOn the heels of his victory, Hawley publicly denounced \u201cconsultants\u201d and \u201cthe professional political class\u201d that he said ran Missouri. \u201cYour day is over,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nJust eight months after taking office, Hawley formed a U.S. Senate exploratory committee. I can appreciate the fact that ambition and politics go hand in hand, but as we discussed in February, I\u2019ve never seen a politician go out of his way to promise voters he wouldn\u2019t use his office to seek higher office, only to shamelessly break that promise less than a year later.\n\nBut what we didn\u2019t know until yesterday was how Hawley spent those first eight months as the state attorney general. The Kansas City Star reported yesterday that just weeks after his swearing in, the Republican brought in a team of political consultants to \u201chelp direct the office of the Missouri attorney general.\u201d\n\nHawley\u2019s out-of-state political consultants gave direct guidance and tasks to his taxpayer-funded staff, and followed up to ensure the tasks were completed, according to emails, text messages and other records obtained by The Kansas City Star. [\u2026] As the months went on, Hawley\u2019s political consultants flew to Missouri for official events and to meet with the attorney general\u2019s staff during work hours in the state Supreme Court building, where the 38-year-old Republican\u2019s official office is located. The campaign-led strategy sessions, which began in January 2017, raised legal and ethical concerns at the time among some of Hawley\u2019s employees, who worried about mixing politics with public business. The situation also left them confused about the chain of command.\n\nAmong other things, Hawley\u2019s out-of-state consultants had input into the state AG\u2019s budget, personnel, and the rollout of official initiatives.\n\nOr put another way, when the Missouri Republican told \u201cconsultants\u201d and \u201cthe professional political class\u201d that their day was \u201cover,\u201d he was lying.\n\nTwo weeks ago, both the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the New York Times took separate looks at Josh Hawley\u2019s (R) tenure as state attorney general, and both painted an unflattering portrait, including criticisms from state judges over his office\u2019s work.\n\nThat office suddenly looks a whole lot worse.\n\nHawley is taking on incumbent Sen.

Always. Always.\u201d There\u2019s no real ambiguity here: the president is brazenly lying about his party and its approach to health care. Lying. Lying.\n\nBut it\u2019s a familiar deception. GOP officials and candidates have spent the 2018 election season pretending to be progressive champions of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s most popular provisions, most notably protections for those with pre-existing conditions. The Washington Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler has a good piece today on ads from Rep. Scott Taylor (R-Va.), Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), and Gov. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), each of whom have boasted to voters about their support for \u201cforcing insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions.\u201d\n\nAnd if that phrasing sounds familiar, it\u2019s because that\u2019s Barack Obama\u2019s line.\n\n[S]ome Republicans are stealing Obama\u2019s rhetoric and claiming they will do what the ACA \u2013 which remains largely intact, despite President Trump\u2019s efforts \u2013 already does. It\u2019s certainly an interesting turnaround. [\u2026] The irony is rich: After years of trashing Obamacare, these Republicans are now saying they will do what he promised he would if elected president.\n\nThis is, of course, well-tread ground. The GOP\u2019s efforts to pull off an extraordinary con on health care is one of the year\u2019s most striking developments. The fact that some Republicans have begun echoing Barack Obama\u2019s script, hoping the public won\u2019t know the difference, is simply the capstone to a ridiculous attempt at deception.\n\nBut Matt Yglesias raised a related point yesterday that struck me as notable: \u201cThe racist and demagogic aspect of the GOP 2018 message is at least honest. The health care message is the most bizarre lying I\u2019ve ever seen in American politics.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s true. Republicans, especially the president, have made all kinds of false claims about immigration and the existing system, but there is a core truth at the heart of their argument: GOP officials and candidates want voters to know that the party embraces a divisive, ethno-nationalistic posture on the issue.\n\nThey\u2019re not telling the truth about the details \u2013 Democrats have not endorsed an \u201copen border,\u201d for example, and there\u2019s no left-wing caravan conspiracy \u2013 but the broader theme reflects a legitimate sentiment. Republicans have moved sharply to the right on immigration and they want the public to know it.\n\nOn health care, however, the GOP is lying about the details and the broader sentiment behind them. The party is, for all intents and purposes, pretending to be Democrats, despite everything they said and did up until a few months ago.\n\nThe fact that Republicans are parroting Obama\u2019s rhetoric from a decade ago is extraordinary, but the fact that they expect voters to believe it is laughable.", "Vermont candidate says voters view '18 as a referendum copied!\n\nVermont Democratic gubernatorial candidate Christine Hallquist joins Morning Joe to discuss resigning as the CEO of Vermont Electric Cooperative to run for office.

We needed to because of the amount of casualties that were being absorbed.\u201d\n\nBut in the same interview, Miller talked about his vision for a resolution to the conflict.\n\n\u201cThis is not going to be won militarily,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThis is going to a political solution.\u201d \u201cMy assessment is the Taliban also realizes they cannot win militarily. So if you realize you can\u2019t win militarily at some point, fighting is just, people start asking why. So you do not necessarily wait us out, but I think now is the time to start working through the political piece of this conflict.\u201d\n\nThat assessment makes a lot of sense, but it\u2019s hard not to notice that there\u2019s some tension between the competing aspects of the general\u2019s vision.\n\nOn the one hand, Miller explained the merits of \u201can offensive mindset\u201d in which U.S. forces take the fight to the Taliban. On the other hand, Miller also believes the conflict cannot be won \u201cmilitarily.\u201d\n\nI understand, of course, that the broader strategy involves making military gains, which would motivate the enemy to reach a political/diplomatic solution.\n\nBut how is that different from the plan that\u2019s been in place for most of the 17-year war?", "During a brief Q&A with reporters yesterday afternoon, Donald Trump was asked about his latest criticism of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). The president ignored the question and instead addressed the issue that prompted his pointed remarks at the congressional leader.\n\n\u201cBirthright citizenship is a very, very important subject. In my opinion, it\u2019s much less complex than people think. I think it says it very loud and clear in the Constitution that you don\u2019t have to go through the process of whatever they\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nWait, \u201cwhatever they\u2019re talking about\u201d? If the constitutional principle is \u201cmuch less complex than people think,\u201d why can\u2019t the president talk about it in a coherent way?\n\nSoon after, Trump headlined another campaign rally in Florida, where he declared, \u201c[T]he Constitution does not \u2013 I say that to the media \u2013 does not require [birthright citizenship] \u2013 read it \u2013 because illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re not?\n\nThe 14th Amendment, enacted in the aftermath of the Civil War, states that everyone \u201cborn or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\u201d Part of the president\u2019s latest push is arguing that non-citizens are not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States, so we need not consider their children Americans, even if those kids are born on American soil.\n\nOf course, as George Conway explained last night, \u201cWere that true, then the government wouldn\u2019t be able to arrest [undocumented immigrants]. Surely that\u2019s not the president\u2019s position. Clearly he has no comprehension of the words he\u2019s using.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, he keeps using the words anyway. Here was the rest of Trump\u2019s speech on the subject at his Florida rally:\n\n\u201cBirthright citizenship, you know all about it. We will keep the criminals, the drug dealers, we will keep them all out of our country. We will get rid of all of this. We will end, finally, birthright citizenship.\u201d\n\nJust so we\u2019re clear, birthright citizenship doesn\u2019t apply to criminals and drug dealers; it applies to infants.\n\nI want to believe the president understands this, but given recent events, it\u2019s tough to be sure.", "Andrew Gillum: I will win because Floridians trust me copied!\n\nTallahassee, Fla.

The shooter said he was motivated by his belief in a conspiracy theory: a Jewish financier, the gunman said, is paying for an \u201cinvasion\u201d of Central American migrants seeking refuge in the United States.\n\nTwo days after the attack, Donald Trump publicly endorsed \u2013 twice \u2013 the idea of a migrant \u201cinvasion,\u201d and four days after the attack, the president lent credence to the idea of a Jewish financier. This was the exchange between Trump and a reporter during a brief White House Q&A yesterday afternoon:\n\nQ: Do you think somebody is funding the caravan? Do you think somebody is paying for the caravan? TRUMP: I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. Q: George Soros? Who\u2019s paying for it? TRUMP: I don\u2019t know who. But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. A lot of people say yes.\n\nWe\u2019re left with the painful realization that the sitting president of the United States has now offered at least some public support for the exact conspiracy theory \u2013 for which there is no evidence \u2013 that drove a madman to commit the deadliest crime against Jewish Americans in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nComplicating matters, this isn\u2019t the only way in which Trump has badly screwed up the response to the mass shooting in Pittsburgh.\n\nIgnoring appeals from local officials, the president traveled to the city this week to pay his respects. Yesterday, however, Trump went out of his way to make the visit about him, writing on Twitter, \u201cMelania and I were treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh. The Office of the President was shown great respect on a very sad & solemn day. We were treated so warmly.\u201d\n\nIn other words, what Trump seems to consider important was not the president paying his respects, but rather, others paying respect to him.\n\nSoon after, the Republican apparently couldn\u2019t resist connecting the slaying to campaign politics, publishing a separate tweet that read, \u201cYesterday in Pittsburgh I was really impressed with Congressman Keith Rothfus (far more so than any other local political figure). His sincere level of compassion, grief and sorrow for the events that took place was, in its own way, very inspiring. Vote for Keith!\u201d\n\nAll of this comes on the heels of Trump, shortly after learning of the mass shooting, complaining about the synagogue failing to have armed guards inside the house of worship to protect its congregants.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t have been difficult for the president to respond to the deadly violence in Pittsburgh in a respectful and responsible way.
