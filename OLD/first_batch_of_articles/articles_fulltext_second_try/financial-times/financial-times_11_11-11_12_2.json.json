Theranos\u2019s board once counted among its members former US secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, and Jim Mattis, current US defence secretary. The group also attracted high-profile investors, including moguls Larry Ellison and Rupert Murdoch.\n\nAccepting the award, Mr Carreyrou said that readers should learn from the Theranos scandal that the \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d approach to technology innovation did not work well in areas such as healthcare or self-driving vehicles: \u201cI hope that people read this book and keep in mind that this Silicon Valley playbook doesn\u2019t apply very well to regulated industries and especially doesn\u2019t [apply] when lives are at stake.\u201d\n\nLionel Barber, FT editor and chair of the judging panel, called Bad Blood \u201ca brilliant piece of enterprise journalism\u201d that \u201creads at times like a thriller\u201d.\n\nElizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos who has been charged with perpetrating a multimillion dollar fraud on investors, doctors and patients \u00a9 Bloomberg\n\nKevin Sneader, global managing partner of McKinsey, the consulting firm that supports the prize, presented the award to Mr Carreyrou, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal. Mr Sneader said the book taught lessons about \u201cthe proper trade-offs between fostering innovation and conducting due diligence\u201d.\n\nThe award dinner was addressed by Charlotte Hogg, chief executive of Visa Europe. At the same ceremony, Andrew Leon Hanna collected the \u00a315,000 Bracken Bower Prize for the best proposal for a business book by an author aged under 35. His book, Twenty-Five Million Sparks, will explore how entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial ideas emerge from refugee camps and communities.\n\nThe Business Book of the Year Award was launched in 2005 and goes to the book that provides the \u201cmost compelling and enjoyable insight into modern business issues, including management, finance and economics\u201d.\n\nIn 2017, it was won by Amy Goldstein for Janesville, about the impact of factory closure on a US community.\n\nThe other shortlisted titles, each of which receives \u00a310,000, were: Capitalism in America by Alan Greenspan and Adrian Wooldridge; Annie Lowrey\u2019s Give People Money; James Crabtree\u2019s The Billionaire Raj; Mariana Mazzucato\u2019s The Value of Everything; and Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms\u2019 New Power.\n\nMore information, reviews and podcasts at www.ft.com/bookaward.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "California wildfires kill 31 and more than 200 missing\n\nThe death toll in wildfires raging across California rose to at least 31, with another 200 people recorded as missing, as three sprawling blazes burnt homes and property, forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people and destroyed an entire town.", "With an unmatched number of scoops, Brexit has become our most read and commented-on topic since the referendum.

On Monday, the kingdom's energy minister, Khalid Al-Falih, said supply curbs of 1m barrels a day could be necessary, as concerns about an oversupplied market mount.\n\nThe day before, Mr Falih had said that state energy giant Saudi Aramco would export 500,000 fewer barrels a day in December compared with November. This is a big shift from earlier in the summer, when US President Donald Trump called on Opec to help compensate for a loss in Iranian barrels after the reimposition of US sanctions against Tehran. Even as the kingdom pledged to relax supply curbs and increase output, the Trump administration granted waivers to big consumers of Iranian oil, such as India and China, allowing more crude than expected into global markets.\n\nBut the Saudi position could put the kingdom at odds with Russia, its main partner outside of the cartel. Moscow believes that any extra supply could be short term, and oil companies in the country are primed to boost output by 300,000 barrels a day.\n\nAs attention turns to the next meeting of ministers in December, there is a question of how Saudi persuades Russia to enter into another deal to keep their landmark oil alliance alive.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "With an unmatched number of scoops, Brexit has become our most read and commented-on topic since the referendum.

Total debt topped $1.5tn this year and studies suggest that nearly 40 per cent of borrowers are likely to default on their loans by 2023. But this is not the only bad news for the higher education sector in America, writes Rana Foroohar in her column.\n\nJust as bad is that most US education is now disconnected from the needs of both students and the labour market, Rana notes. Rather than acquiring vocational skills that will equip them for the workplace, young people are increasingly pushed towards getting a qualification \u2014 usually in the form of a four-year college degree.\n\nThe solution, she suggests, is for government to work with businesses, talking to employers about what skills they need and putting money into programmes that foster those skills.\n\nWolfgang M\u00fcnchau asks whether British Remainers can count on the EU to extend the Brexit deadline of March 29, 2019, with growing appetite for a second referendum.\n\nLuigi Zingales argues Milton Friedman\u2019s notion that a company\u2019s only duty is to maximise value for shareholders is mistaken.

Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nIn late 2015, investors in one of China\u2019s largest peer-to-peer lending companies, Ezubao, found themselves unable to retrieve their deposits. By September the next year, 26 Ezubao employees had been sentenced for effectively running a Ponzi scheme and failing to repay as much as Rmb38bn ($5.5bn) to investors.\n\nIt was one of the biggest and most brazen cases where a Chinese peer-to-peer lending company turned out to be fraudulent, but by no means the only one.\n\nAlmost three years later, Chinese regulators are still struggling to catch up with the workings of the runaway industry. The country\u2019s policymakers face a particular challenge: how to rein in financial risks without causing panic among peer-to-peer investors and potential social unrest.\n\nPeer-to-peer, or P2P, lending works by matching up someone looking to invest with someone looking for funding, often with promises of double-digit returns on short-term investments.\n\nThe concept has found fertile ground in China. The country lacks a unified credit ratings system, making it difficult for rural residents and smaller entrepreneurs to access consumer credit. Meanwhile, China\u2019s emerging middle class is flush with cash but distrustful of investing in China\u2019s speculative property and volatile stock markets.\n\nThe fast-growing P2P lending industry, however, has become rife with fraud. Policymakers are cautious about intervening, because they are concerned that heavy regulation could cause financial chaos among P2P companies into which millions of people have poured their savings. China\u2019s P2P lending industry recorded transactions valued at $445bn in 2017, according to Online Lending Club, a data company.\n\n1590 Number of P2P lending platforms operating in China\n\n\u201cThere are still over one thousand platforms kicking around in China,\u201d says Spencer Li, vice-president of online lending platform Fincera. He says sudden or heavy regulation could put some of them in crisis. \u201cI think [the regulators] are trying to buy more time and just hope more platforms either close down in a legal way or gradually phase out.\u201d\n\nIn early 2016, P2P platforms braced for the first wave of regulation intended to standardise the industry. The new rules placed caps on loan sizes and forced lenders to use custodian banks to hold their deposits.\n\nHowever, enforcement has been delayed. In particular, a \u201crecord-filing\u201d process, the first step in introducing a P2P licensing system, was originally scheduled to close by this summer but has been extended to the end of this year.\n\nEven this gentle regulation has started to take a toll on P2P lending platforms. Numbers have thinned from 2,205 platforms at the beginning of this year to 1,590 platforms as of this August, according to Online Lending Platform, a website that tracks P2P data. Since the beginning of this year, the iOS app store and certain Chinese Android app stores have begun culling the number of P2P platforms available for download.\n\nThis poses a dilemma for Chinese authorities. China has been waging a battle against corporate debt in a national financial de-risking campaign over the past year. But rooting out systemic financial vulnerabilities could touch off social unrest as bad debt is winnowed out.\n\nInvestors keep going back to P2P because there are no other alternative investments ready for them. Ether Yin, Trivium China\n\nThis summer, a ring of P2P platforms around the city of Hangzhou, 170km from Shanghai, collapsed. Angry investors, unable to retrieve their money, engulfed the Shanghai public security bureau, demanding government action. The Beijing police were out in force, meanwhile, to prevent protests in the capital\u2019s financial district.\n\nBalancing financial prudence and civic order is of particular concern as China faces a slowing economy and trade war with the US. Such circumstances have, in short, created a moral hazard: mom-and-pop investors are aware that local governments can be pressed to compensate financial victims rather than risk social instability.\n\n\u201cMany individuals don\u2019t have the mindset of investing and the risks it entails,\u201d says Ether Yin, a co-founder at Beijing-based politics and economics consultancy Trivium China. But when things go wrong, investors \u201cgo to the government as they think the government cannot afford massive disturbance\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe government should have not let this happen,\u201d says Ivy Zhang, a Shanghai-based consultant who lost Rmb85,000 of her savings in the collapse of a P2P platform called Zhuaqianmao.\n\nInvestors, meanwhile, keep going back to P2P, says Mr Yin, because of a lack of \u201cother alternative investments ready for them\u201d.", "Finally banks may have found a problem that blockchain is able to solve now and at scale: cross border currency transfers.\n\nThe banking sector has seen years of overhype and experimentation surrounding distributed ledger technology, but one project led by JPMorgan Chase, the Interbank Information Network (IIN), is quietly producing results at scale.\n\nThe IIN is essentially a more efficient way for participating banks to transfer US dollars across borders and institutions. Its elevator pitch is that problematic payments, which are currently being held up for as much as two days for compliance issues or to resolve errors, could go through almost instantly under the new system.\n\nThe network does not have the wow factor of other fintech innovations like chatbots and robot traders, but its obscurity does not detract from its significance. A success would buoy spirits in an industry that has spent $1.7bn on blockchain projects which have yet to meet banks\u2019 \u201clofty expectations\u201d, according to analysts at market intelligence advisory Greenwich Associates.\n\n\u201cCertainly from a size of ecosystem perspective and starting to do something in production, having [so many] banks [participate] and some of the world\u2019s biggest banks is a big deal,\u201d says David Treat, head of Accenture\u2019s capital markets blockchain practice.\n\nUntil the end of 2017 \u201ceverything was experimental and prototypes, production was something small and safe in the corner,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen this year is a move to real life production. And now the first of to those ecosystems is taking on real life use cases.\u201d\n\nMr Treat hints that while the IIN is out on its own now as the industry\u2019s only blockchain project of scale, it will not enjoy that status for long. \u201cMore and more proof points are coming out that are building confidence among leaders in this industry, that we\u2019re actually at the point where real value is going to happen,\u201d he adds.\n\nThere is still an open debate on what \u201creal value\u201d is. Blockchain\u2019s early evangelists saw the technology\u2019s potential for greatly reducing banks\u2019 costs by eliminating manual reconciliation work and other labour intensive database tasks.\n\nBanks do not expect IIN to generate significant savings, however, either now or in the future.\n\n\u201cBlockchain is frankly a great technology, however, I\u2019m not sure that the initial hypothesis that everyone had about saving significant sums of money is where you\u2019ll see a lot of the new products being developed,\u201d says Umar Farooq, head of blockchain at JPMorgan. \u201cIt will be much more about doing things that could not be done without blockchain technology, creating new products . . . When you look at it purely as an expense saving mechanism that limits the potential of the technology.\u2019\n\nInstead of fixating on costs, JPMorgan has spoken about the potential for IIN to help banks fend off competition from fintech starts up which have exploited inefficiencies in cross border payments to offer cheaper and faster solutions.\n\nWhether IIN can become big enough to do that, and to have any sort of real impact in the marketplace, remains to be seen. JPMorgan estimates that IIN will handle more than 300,000 transactions a day, a relatively small number when compared with the 14.5m cross-border payments processed through the Swift system daily.\n\nThe number of transactions grows exponentially as new banks join IIN. The network is growing fast, and now has more than 100 members. The dynamic between the IIN and fintech is an interesting one. For years, banks have been insisting that fintechs are friends not foes and Mr Treat says that spirit still generally holds.\n\nIn the case of IIN, however, fintechs had minimal involvement in the network\u2019s development, and the project\u2019s objectives include protecting market share which fintechs, such as Transferwise and Revolut are targeting.\n\n\u201cIf a fintech takes an aggressive stance against a bank and it\u2019s not a two way partnership, sure, there\u2019s massive competition and a very tough road,\u201d says Mr Treat. \u201cThere are more (bank/fintech relationships) that are actually flourishing . . . than where there\u2019s outward competition.\u201d\n\nMr Farooq says that while fintechs were \u201cnot currently involved directly\u201d in the IIN, \u201cwe actively participate with fintechs across all parts of the bank\u201d.\n\nInefficiency in banks\u2019 legacy payment systems is arguably one of the tougher problems for a third party fintech to address, since the solution requires an intimate knowledge of the problems, which most fintech outsiders simply would not have. The next big blockchain effort might be a more collaborative venture across the banks to fintech divide.", "Arizona, often associated with golf-playing pensioners and selfie-taking Grand Canyon visitors, might not seem the most obvious place to look for cutting-edge financial technology.\n\nYet in March this year, Arizona became the first US state to set up a so-called regulatory sandbox for fintech start-ups \u2014 essentially a test environment in which early-stage companies that are innovating in the financial sector are given limited access to the market under regulatory supervision, without having to be fully licensed.\n\nIt is a step towards opening up the fintech industry in a country whose regulatory landscape has until now put off many start-ups with its perceived heavy-handedness, and could make it easier for companies from outside the US to test their products on the market.\n\nThe sandbox idea was first conceived by Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), whose test environment has accepted 89 companies since its inception in 2016 and is taking applications for its fifth cohort. The model has since been copied by regulators across the globe, as they compete to lure start-ups by offering them the most innovation-friendly environments.\n\nWhile countries such as Denmark, Russia and Canada have set up their own sandboxes, the US has until now not joined the race, largely because its federalised system \u2014 under which each of its 50 states sets its own rules \u2014 has made a synchronised regulatory regime tricky.\n\nThe regulatory framework is very fragmented in the United States, so there\u2019s no guidance for fintechs Darryn Jones, Greater Phoenix Economic Council\n\n\u201cThe fintech regulatory framework is very fragmented in the United States,\u201d says Darryn Jones, who is in charge of business development at the Greater Phoenix Economic Council, the public-private partnership that has set up the Arizona sandbox.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s no guidance for fintechs \u2014 which are innovating in things like money transmission, consumer lending, robo-advising . . . and blockchain \u2014 to understand how they will be regulated, and which compliance schemes are relevant to them,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has not taken charge on setting up the infrastructure and framework for these firms, so what Arizona did is it said: instead of waiting for the federal government, we\u2019ll take the lead and develop our own sandbox, modelling it on the FCA sandbox,\u201d Mr Jones says.\n\n2 years Time that fintechs will have to test their offerings in the Arizona sandbox\n\nUnlike the FCA\u2019s six-month programme, Arizona is giving companies two years to test their fintech offerings. At that point, they can apply for a licence to operate as a money services business. If that is granted, it is then relatively easy to apply for a licence in the 16 other states that have signed up to an agreement that standardises key elements of the licensing process. These include Texas and Illinois but not such key states as New York and California.\n\nWhile the US still has no nationwide sandbox, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) set up an \u201coffice of innovation\u201d in July, appointing lawyer Paul Watkins \u2014 who managed Arizona\u2019s sandbox \u2014 to lead it. In August, the CFPB said it was joining 11 other financial regulators in a \u201cGlobal Financial Innovation Network\u201d, on the back of the FCA\u2019s proposal earlier this year to create a \u201cglobal sandbox\u201d.\n\nMr Jones says this indicates that the US does not want to be left behind in a competitive environment, in which the pace of technological change in the financial services industry is accelerating.\n\n\u201cA lot of fintechs shy away from innovating in the US and come to places like London to deploy their products, because they don\u2019t have regulatory certainty in the United States,\u201d he says.\n\nArizona representatives travelled to London this summer in an effort to woo UK fintechs interested in setting up operations in the US, not least because of worries about their ability to attract and retain staff in the UK after Brexit. So far just three companies have been accepted into the sandbox but more are expected to in the coming months.\n\nThe idea for the FCA sandbox came from the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser at the time, Sir Mark Walport. He had suggested that the financial services industry needed to have something equivalent to the clinical trials that the health and pharmaceutical sectors undergo.\n\n\u201cAs regulators we\u2019re under constant pressure to be more pro-innovative,\u201d says Anna Wallace, head of innovation at the FCA. A regulatory sandbox allows you \u201cto do that in a way that gives you comfort that you\u2019re creating an environment that you control\u201d, she adds.\n\n\u201cUp until now regulators have never had the power to do that \u2014 the regulators have either decided whether something is outside or inside regulation. The regulatory sandbox provides a third way, where you can allow it in a small way into regulation, so you can observe what the risks and issues of that business model are. You control that environment before allowing it into the market,\u201d Ms Wallace says.\n\nSome worry that, by putting such an emphasis on innovation, regulators risk not performing their essential role: that of protecting customers and investors, and maintaining financial stability.\n\nThe last cohort accepted into the FCA sandbox, for example, has included a number of cryptocurrency companies. This is an area the UK\u2019s Treasury Committee has raised concerns about, warning that crypto assets are often used to facilitate criminal activity and can pose risks for inexperienced retail customers.\n\n\u201cGiven the rate at which the sandbox concept is spreading\u201d, says Martin Walker, director at the Centre for Evidence-Based Management, a think-tank, \u201cthere probably should be a genuinely independent review of the FCA sandbox.\u201d", "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nStock exchange operators from Shanghai to New York are looking at distributed ledger technology (DLT) in hopes that it can make their computer systems more efficient, reliable, and secure.\n\nA pilot project in Canada suggests that these potential benefits will take time to realise, however, and that working around regulations will be a bigger hurdle than perfecting the technology itself.\n\nWorldwide, three quarters of the financial market infrastructure operators surveyed by Nasdaq and Celent are working on distributed ledger technology pilots or already using DLT. The Australian Securities Exchange is the first major bourse to commit to replacing part of its settlement infrastructure with DLT, although it recently delayed the switch by six months to spring 2021.\n\nAn eight-week DLT pilot by Canada\u2019s central bank suggests that practical applications for the technology may take even longer to arrive.\n\n\u201cWe see that there is promise in distributed ledger,\u201d said Scott Hendry, director of financial technology at the Bank of Canada, in March when he announced the completion of the pilot, named Project Jasper Phase 3.\n\n\u201cBut when you are looking at core systems that are systemically important and have been optimised over 20 years or more, the bar is very high for this alternative technology to offer significant benefit,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the first two phases of Project Jasper, the bank worked with the national payments network operator, Payments Canada, to build a distributed ledger technology system for cash transfers between banks. TMX Group \u2014 which operates the Toronto Stock Exchange \u2014 joined for Phase 3, which involved building a proof of concept system that could instantly execute the swap of cash and equities for agreed-upon trades.\n\nSuch a system could ultimately form part of a more complete DLT trading infrastructure which proponents hope will be faster and reduce reconciliation costs. The project\u2019s leaders say, however, that there are many more questions to answer before those benefits arrive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less and less about the technology, actually, as that matures and becomes more production ready,\u201d says Andrew McCormack, vice-president of payments and technology at Payments Canada. \u201cIt\u2019s more about the regulatory, the legal, the monetary policy issues.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s less and less about the technology. It\u2019s more about the regulatory, the legal, the monetary policy issues\n\nFor example, Mr McCormack says, brokers needed digital cash in order to pay for securities within the distributed ledger system in the pilot. The most technically straightforward option was to give them access to funds issued by the central bank. A previous phase of the Jasper project had already made this digital cash available to major banks. However, Mr McCormack says giving it to brokers would have \u201ccrossed the chasm and literally broke our own bylaws and, in actual fact, laws\u201d.\n\nBrokers do not typically meet the balance sheet requirements that banks have to pass in order to gain access to central bank cash, in what is called the high-value payment system, explains Mr McCormack. It raised the question: \u201cHow do we get the cash, on-ledger, to those who are doing the equities trades to facilitate the magic of what this platform can give us?\u201d\n\nUltimately, the team found a technical solution by giving different levels of access to cash and credit to different participants. The ability to set rules like this is a key advantage that a private DLT platform has over bitcoin-style public blockchains, which give everyone equal access. A private platform of this kind can be built to follow existing banking rules \u2014 maintaining the distinct roles of the central bank, commercial banks, and brokers.\n\nEven with this capacity, Mr McCormack still believes regulatory changes will eventually be required to facilitate any move to DLT. These legal questions need more attention. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019re just building TV on the internet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are trying to figure out a way to do this better.\u201d\n\nThe Bank of Canada is not yet engaging with this part of the problem. \u201cThe bank has not considered making regulatory changes in order to facilitate a change to DLT,\u201d says Mr Hendry.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of governance,\u201d says John Lee, managing director of enterprise innovation and product development at the TMX Group. The digital cash-for-equity swap might seem simple, but managing risk and ensuring ironclad reliability are not.\n\nProject Jasper simply proved that such a system could function. Whether it could perform at scale and meet security, resilience, and credit-risk standards remains an open question.\n\nIs the cost and disruption worth it? That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re thinking about\n\n\u201cIf you truly want to put this into production and scale it up, you have to deal with the non-glorious elements,\u201d says Mr Lee. \u201cThere needs to be a reason that DLT was the best technical solution for that use case.\u201d\n\nFor Mr McCormack, finding those truly useful applications means deciding which parts of a nation\u2019s financial markets\u2019 infrastructure ought to be included in a DLT system. The Jasper pilot was limited to securities settlement. A future system might incorporate other steps in a securities trade; other assets, like derivatives or bonds; or integrate with trading systems in other countries. The Canadian experiment simultaneously demonstrated the need to consider these more-complex applications, and the difficulty of bringing them to fruition.\n\n\u201cIf you are too narrow, it is tough to find the business case,\u201d says Mr McCormack. \u201cIt\u2019s more and more obvious to us now that we need to be ambitious in scope.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Mr McCormack believes the merit of any switch to DLT should be judged on a cost-benefit basis. \u201cIs the cost and disruption worth it?\u201d he asks. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re thinking about.\u201d", "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nWhen Noah Breslow rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange in the week before Christmas 2014, it was a high point \u2014 perhaps the high point \u2014 for the fledgling online lending industry.\n\nThe company he ran, OnDeck, had grown rapidly in the years after the financial crisis by supplying quick and fuss-free credit to small businesses over the internet.\n\nBy then hundreds of similar online platforms had sprung up, trying to bypass Main Street lenders like Chase and Bank of America, which were grappling with a whole host of tougher regulations brought in after the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.\n\nOne company targeting consumer loans, Lending Club of San Francisco, had made a splashy market debut two weeks before OnDeck, talking of transforming \u201cthe entire banking system, making it more transparent, more cost efficient, more consumer friendly\u201d.\n\nMuch of the excitement has evaporated. Rising delinquencies on some classes of loans and a governance scandal at Lending Club have given the entire industry a rough ride.\n\nTalk of putting big brick-and-mortar lenders like Citibank and Bank of America out of business has turned to working with them, providing ready-made parcels of loans the banks can hold, while supplying software so that banks can originate loans to their existing customers more efficiently.\n\nMeanwhile, most of the platforms have slashed sales teams, while increasing staff in their compliance and legal departments, as regulators have begun to pay more attention to the potential threats the platforms pose to financial stability.\n\nMr Breslow, a fast-talking Bostonian, says the entire online lending industry is better, and more durable, for that humbling experience. OnDeck itself has made money for its shareholders in three of the last four quarters, and has seen its shares more than double since a trough in May last year.\n\n\u201c2015 to 2017 was a pretty interesting time,\u201d says the 43-year-old chief executive, from OnDeck\u2019s headquarters on Broadway in New York. \u201cBut we made some aggressive changes.\u201d\n\nTech-focused investors were primed for rapid revenue growth, and when it failed to materialise, they sold the stock.\n\nKey to the turnround was a realisation that the original \u201cmarketplace\u201d structure had to change. Under that model, also known as \u201cpeer-to-peer,\u201d companies like OnDeck tried to act like simple matchmakers, connecting applicants with investors who liked the look of their credit profile, in exchange for an upfront fee.\n\nBack in the summer of 2015, some 40 per cent OnDeck\u2019s loans were funded that way. But that left it vulnerable to withdrawals of investors when market sentiment soured, leaving the company with a mountain of fixed costs to cover with patchy income.\n\nNow, the company has shifted almost entirely to signing long-term supply deals with institutions such as banks and life insurance companies. Every loan that comes in through the door is effectively already committed to be sold.\n\nOnDeck has aimed to overhaul its shareholder register, meanwhile, going out of its way to attract finance-focused investors, rather than tech accounts that wanted to see gung-ho growth every quarter.\n\nOnDeck\u2019s skew towards the latter kind of investor was a byproduct of its initial public offering, when \u201cfintech\u201d was among the hottest themes on Wall Street. Back then, underwriters had courted tech-focused fund managers with prospectuses laden with Silicon Valley buzzwords like \u201ctotal addressable market\u201d and \u201cproprietary algorithms that leverage behavioural data\u201d.\n\nInvestors like these were primed for rapid revenue growth, and when this failed to materialise, they sold the stock. OnDeck\u2019s peak-to-trough decline in its share price was 86 per cent; Lending Club\u2019s was 90 per cent. However much the companies protested that slower top-line growth was actually a positive \u2014 implying that they were being more selective on lending \u2014 investors were unpersuaded.\n\nOver the past couple of years OnDeck has spent more time at investor conferences focused on financial stocks, while cultivating more of a following among financials-focused analysts.\n\nThe rewards are coming through, says one institutional investor who spoke on condition of anonymity. The problem was not the business \u2014 which is sound \u2014 but \u201cthe messaging\u201d, he says, which was falling on deaf ears.\n\nI still think we are a fintech but a \u2018tech\u2019 is a stretch Noah Breslow, OnDeck\n\nMr Breslow is happier with the investor mix now and how results are received. In the second quarter, for example, OnDeck reported a slight fall in loan originations, from $591m to $587m. But investors welcomed a relatively low net charge-off rate \u2014 a measure of bad debt \u2014 of 11.2 per cent, from 18.6 per cent a year earlier.\n\nIn the third quarter originations were back up and the charge-off rate edged down further, to 11.1 per cent. Shares in the company bounced almost one-third following the results \u2014 the biggest one-day move since the IPO.\n\n\u201cI still think we are a fintech but a \u2018tech\u2019 is a stretch,\u201d says Mr Breslow. \u201cWe acknowledge we have . . . credit risk and liquidity risk, which are hallmarks of financial companies,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut at the same time I think we have a very differentiated . . . model at the core, which is powered by original technology and original analytics. Over time we expect companies in this business to be primarily valued by profits.\u201d", "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nOnline banking customers are a third more profitable than traditional bank-based clients, Piyush Gupta, chief executive of Singapore\u2019s biggest bank, DBS, told investors a year ago during a presentation of the bank\u2019s digital strategy. The remark sent DBS shares sharply upwards.\n\nSince launching its mobile phone-based \u201cdisrupter\u201d banks in India and Indonesia in the past two years, DBS has signed up more than 2.6m people by using fingerprint recognition to match them against biometric national identity cards.\n\nSuch new digital customers generate on average a 27 per cent return on equity for the bank, compared with the 18 per cent return it earns on its traditional branch-based customers.\n\nDBS says it makes S$1,300 (\u00a3722) of revenue a year from each of its digital customers, more than double what it makes from traditional customers. Digital customers cost it S$478 each a year for acquisition and back office administrative expenses, compared with costs of S$306 for each traditional customer.\n\nThese figures explain why DBS\u2019s shares rose more than 40 per cent last year and are still outperforming almost all major rivals despite losing some steam this year. Its S$61bn market capitalisation is above many European rivals, including Barclays, BBVA and Deutsche Bank.\n\nFew big banks can tell such a compelling story of how they have responded to the rising challenge of digital disruption that is sweeping across their industry.\n\nIn Europe alone, there are 1,400 new neo-banks, payment providers and fintechs that have sprung up since 2005, according to research by Accenture. As of 2016 they had managed to make \u20ac58bn of annual revenue, equal to between 6 and 7 per cent of the industry\u2019s total.\n\nAdding to the pressure, big technology groups are deepening their financial services sector.\n\nAmazon is providing payment services and loans to merchants on its platform, while Facebook has an electronic money licence in Ireland and its WhatsApp messaging service is building a payments offering in India. Alibaba and Tencent have become dominant operators in China\u2019s $5.5tn payments industry.\n\n\u201cThe message is out there that new digital players are in town and the banks are under attack,\u201d says Richard Lumb, head of financial services at Accenture. \u201cWhat they are scared of is a leakage of customers and that leakage becoming a flood over time.\u201d\n\nBanks are responding in different ways to this digital threat. The Financial Times has spoken to more than a dozen bankers, consultants and fintech executives to analyse how they are doing so. Broadly, they can be grouped into five categories.\n\n1. Digital attackers\n\nThose in this group consider that the best form of defence is attack. Banks with the most advanced digital strategies, like DBS, have launched their own digital banks to enter new markets or defend their patch.\n\nGoldman Sachs launched a consumer digital savings and lending operation two years ago. Named Marcus \u2014 after Goldman\u2019s 19th century founder \u2014 the new digital operation has accumulated more than $26bn in deposits and lent $3bn to customers, generating over $1bn of new revenue for the Wall Street bank. Marcus recently launched in the UK, its first international expansion, offering the highest interest rate in the country to entice savers.\n\nDutch bank ING adopted a similar approach when it launched Yolt last year, offering customers a way to collate all their financial information in one place, track their spending and saving and get prompts to save money on utility bills. Yolt has signed up more than 400,000 users in the UK and recently announced plans to expand into France and Italy.\n\nRoyal Bank of Scotland chief executive Ross McEwan told the FT that it had six standalone digital units in development. They include one called B\u00f3 \u2014 from the verb to stay in Danish \u2014 which aims to compete with fintechs like Monzo by helping customers manage their money better.\n\n2. Acquisitions\n\nHampered by the vast cost and complexity of maintaining their old systems, sometimes banks find it easier to buy or invest in a start-up that has built a digital platform from scratch.\n\nOne that has pursued this strategy is Spain\u2019s BBVA, acquiring a string of digital upstarts including Simple in the US, Atom Bank in the UK and Holvi in Finland. BBVA has invested $250m in Propel Venture Partners, a standalone venture capital fund to invest in fintechs around the world.\n\nBPCE, the large French mutual bank formed by the merger of Banques Populaires and Caisses d\u2019Epargne, recently followed suit by acquiring Fidor Bank, the online bank with more than 120,000 customers in Germany and the UK.\n\n3. Partnerships\n\nBank bosses complain loudly of an uneven playing field that allows big technology groups to offer financial services without the burdensome regulation that traditional lenders face. That has not stopped some banks teaming up with Big Tech groups.\n\nOne example possibly in the making is the potential partnership between JPMorgan Chase and Amazon, which would bring together the US\u2019s biggest bank and the largest US ecommerce company. The deal would give JPMorgan access to 100m Amazon customers using the Prime service. The partnership might be extended into other areas such as an Amazon-branded checking account.\n\nIn Asia, Standard Chartered has teamed up with China\u2019s Alipay to launch a digital remittance service, using blockchain technology to send money across borders quickly and cheaply. The duo has also teamed up with GCash, the mobile payments arm of Globe Telecoms in the Philippines, to allow people to send money between Hong Kong and the Philippines using their mobile phones. The plan is to expand the service to other markets.\n\n4. Diversification\n\nWhile their core payments and lending businesses may be under pressure from digital competitors, some banks are using new technologies to move into new markets.\n\nDave McKay, Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s chief executive, recently unveiled a strategy to turn Canada\u2019s biggest bank into a broader \u201cplatform\u201d offering diverse services, from registering a start-up company to helping people rent their house on Airbnb.\n\nWhen its customers are looking to buy or sell a home, RBC offers to research neighbourhoods, move furniture, paint a house and even decide which bins to take out each week.\n\nOther banks, too, are branching out. Barclays offers to store important documents, such as passports and birth certificates, on the cloud for customers. Commonwealth Bank of Australia gives businesses insights into the spending habits of its customers through its Daily IQ tool.\n\n5. \u2018If you can\u2019t beat them, join them\u2019\n\nSometimes banks decide that the threat from digital competition is so great that they just have to amend their business models.\n\nAna Bot\u00edn, executive chairman of Spain\u2019s Banco Santander, said it was seeing her son using a rival service in order more quickly and cheaply to transfer money overseas, that persuaded her to make Santander the first international bank to launch a cross-border payments system based on blockchain.\n\nFive years ago, France\u2019s BNP Paribas launched Hello Bank as a standalone pan-European digital bank. Hello Bank now has more than 3m customers, including some gained through the acquisitions of Consorsbank in Germany and Compte-Nickel in France.\n\nThat said, launching new services is not easy.\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s UBS said in August it was closing its automated online investment service, SmartWealth, to new clients. It had launched the robo advisory service in 2016, as part of a $1bn investment aimed at attracting younger clients and expanding its wealth management service beyond just the seriously rich.\n\nThe high price of using the service and a high minimum investment were deemed to have put off potential users, however, and UBS concluded that the \u201cnear-term potential\u201d of the service was limited.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "With an unmatched number of scoops, Brexit has become our most read and commented-on topic since the referendum.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel will set out a vision for the EU. We'll get some key indicators on the health of the UK economy, and earnings season kicks off for US retailers. We'll start in Europe, where German Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to address the European Parliament to set out a vision for the EU at a time of huge political change. Her speech on Tuesday comes just weeks after announcing her decision to resign as chair of the Christian Democratic Union party.\n\nSo this address will provide the first signs of how the chancellor intends to approach big European issues during her final stretch in office. As one of Europe's most powerful figures, her looming departure has unsettled some allies in Europe who worry the political transition in Germany might hold back reform efforts in Europe. Ms Merkel's speech to MEPs in Strasbourg will also show whether the chancellor feels more emboldened to take big reform decisions before leaving office, or whether the political constraints facing her government in Berlin will be critical. Here's Gideon Rachman with more on what to expect.\n\nThis will be, in a way, a poignant moment because Angela Merkel has been the dominant figure in European politics for about a decade. And although inevitably, she's done some controversial things on, for example, the eurozone bailouts. Broadly speaking she is regarded in Brussels as a friend and a defender of the European project, and people will be a little anxious about the direction that Germany, the most powerful state in the EU, will take in the post-Merkel era.\n\nBut Merkel will also have to provide guidance and reassurance about other big issues facing the European Union. There's Brexit, which will happen in March 2019 if it goes ahead on schedule. There's a looming confrontation between the new populist nationalist government of Italy and the European Commission over Italy's new budget plans, which break EU rules. And there are big parliamentary elections for the European Parliament in May, which could see the background being a surge in support for populist eurosceptic parties.\n\nSo this is a very big year for the European Union, and it's one in which they, I think, will still look to Angela Merkel, even though she is sliding off the political scene. They'll still be looking to her for a bit of guidance and reassurance.\n\nNow, in the UK we'll be watching for a raft of economic data. Labour market statistics published on Tuesday will include figures on wage growth and employment, while on Wednesday the Office for National Statistics will publish the latest inflation figures. This will give us some insight into how quickly living standards are recovering in the UK this year after the cheaper pound squeezed spending power following the EU referendum. And the last edition of wage growth figures, growth in average earnings excluding bonuses rose to 3.1 per cent in the three months to the end of August. This was the highest rate since 2009. But with inflation of 2.7 per cent in the same period, earnings only grew by 0.4 per cent in real terms. Here's Chris Giles on the outlook for the UK economy.\n\nFollowing a strong summer for the UK economy, the question this week is whether we're now seeing a pretty sharp slowdown this autumn. Business surveys have been really weak recently with companies expressing quite a lot of concern that Brexit uncertainty means that they don't want to invest, don't want to hire staff at the moment. And so the data this week will be a good test of whether these survey indicators, which should be negative, are now reflected in the official data. If it's positive, that means the rest of the year might well be quite strong still. If it's negative, then I think we can say that Brexit is really having quite a depressing effect on the UK economy. And the quicker any deal is done, the better for next year.\n\nAnd finally, earnings season for US retailers gets into full swing this week with third quarter reporting from several of the sector's largest companies. On Thursday, Walmart, the world's biggest retailer, will publish its results, while on Tuesday the home improvement chain Home Depot reports their third-quarter results. The recent bankruptcy of department store Sears points to persistent challenges facing bricks and mortar companies, but much of the rest of the sector is actually coping better with the ecommerce threat.\n\nThe retail industry is benefiting from a robust US economy and strong consumer spending. Even Macy's, the struggling department store chain, is expected on Wednesday to post a year on year rise in same store sales of about 2.5 per cent. Here's Alistair Grey with more on the state of the US retail sector.\n\nThe earnings come at a time of strength in share prices for US retailers. Walmart's jumped about a quarter since lows in May. Wall Street's become more comfortable that Americans are still spending in bricks and mortar stores in the age of Amazon. Sales and profits are being supported by a strong economy. Walmart's like for like sales are expected to be up almost 3 per cent from a year ago. The company's been pushing various initiatives to better compete with ecommerce rivals, from curbside pick-up to same-day delivery.\n\nHome Depot like-for-like sales are expected to be even stronger at 4.7 per cent. The figures come ahead of what's expected to be a buoyant Christmas shopping season, but there are still big questions about the threat from internet retail. Investors will also be keeping a close eye on how the companies respond to price increases that are being pushed through by several of their largest suppliers.\n\nAnd that's the week ahead from the Financial Times in London.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more."]
