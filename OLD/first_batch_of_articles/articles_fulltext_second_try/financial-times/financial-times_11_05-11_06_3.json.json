Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nThis article is from today\u2019s FT Opinion email. Sign up to receive a daily digest of the big issues straight to your inbox.\n\nOn Sunday, on the 100th anniversary of the end of the first world war, more than 60 global leaders will gather in France for the Paris Peace Forum. The simultaneous presence in the French capital of President Emmanuel Macron and his American counterpart, Donald Trump, will carry echoes, argues Gideon Rachman in his column this week, of debates a century ago about the competing merits of international governance and national sovereignty.\n\nMr Macron, Gideon suggests, is the heir to Woodrow Wilson\u2019s high-minded internationalism, while Mr Trump\u2019s robust embrace of the doctrine of \u201cAmerica First\u201d recalls the views of Wilson\u2019s critics in the US Senate. The best clue to which of these outlooks will prevail this time around will be found not in the warm words with which other world leaders will greet Mr Macron\u2019s speech next week, but in their actions.\n\nLawrence Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, writes that while Mr Trump\u2019s public attacks on the Federal Reserve are misguided, there is a need for some pragmatism about central bank independence.\n\nRobert Shrimsley argues that Brexit is teaching Britain a hard lesson about its diminished standing on the world stage.\n\nAnjana Ahuja warns that unprecedented human demand for energy, land and water is threatening the survival of several animal species.\n\nPatti Waldmeir has been interviewing America\u2019s Midwestern blue-collar workers. This demographic, often characterised as angry and disenchanted, seems to be feeling much more cheery as the midterm elections approach.\n\nWhat you\u2019ve been saying\n\nNot a good idea to give autocrats a platform, FT: letter from Jonathan Israel, London, UK\n\nI am not impressed with the Financial Times\u2019 decision to publish an op-ed by Hassan Rouhani, the president of Iran. Providing a platform and normalising autocrats who routinely oversee the execution of homosexuals and declare \u201cDeath to the West\u201d is in my opinion not a sensible decision. I did though enjoy the rich irony of seeing the president accuse other nations of committing atrocities in Yemen and funding terrorist groups. I hope the FT gifted the president a big black kettle in return.\n\nIn response to \u201cFriedrich Merz: conservative disrupter in the race to replace Merkel\u201d, says:\n\n\u201cBut the mere fact that a retired politician is a serious candidate with a chance of winning the leadership of Germany\u2019s largest political party is astonishing. It tells us that the country is in trouble.\u201d Not sure about that conclusion. Most voters look for ideas, principles, and competence that they think will improve their lives. Can ideas, principles, and competence come from a retired person? Arguably, yes\u2026\n\nVotes for women in Sierra Leone: letter from Colin Tapper, Chevy Chase, MD, US\n\nFurther to Marianne Pitts\u2019 letter (November 1): women were first enfranchised in Sierra Leone about a century before New Zealand followed suit in 1893.

It can either do a 180-degree turn from its outlaw course of action, and act like a normal country, or it can see its economy crumble. We hope a new agreement with Iran is possible. But until Iran makes changes in the 12 ways that I listed in May, we will be relentless in exerting pressure on the regime.\n\nAs a reflection of that resolve, today we're reimposing all sanctions that were previously lifted under the nuclear deal. This includes sanctions on energy, banking, shipping, and shipbuilding industries. Since the Trump administration came into office, we've done 19 rounds of sanctions targeting 168 Iranian entities.\n\nToday's sanctions will accelerate the rapid decline of international economic activity in Iran since the implementation of our strategy in May. Since that time, since back in May, over 100 companies have withdrawn from Iran or cancelled plans to do business there. The regime to date, since May, has lost over $2.5bn in oil revenue. We have decided to issue temporary allotments to a handful of countries, responsible for specific circumstances, and to ensure a well supplied oil market. The US will be granting these exemptions to China, India, Italy, Greece, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Turkey.\n\nToday we sanctioned more than 700 individuals, entities, aircraft, and vessels as part of Treasury's largest ever single-day action targeting Iran. These powerful sanctions directly target Iran's banking, energy, and shipping sectors. They must stop ballistic missiles and abandon their nuclear ambitions if they seek a path to sanctions relief.\n\nWe are watching the Iranian regime with laser focus. If they try to evade our sanctions, we will take action to disrupt their activity time and time again. The maximum pressure exerted by the United States is only going to mount from here. Companies around the world need to know we will be strictly enforcing our sanctions.

As with much of what Mr Trump says and does, his way of doing business is counterproductive, irrespective of whatever merit his underlying position may have.\n\nNo self-respecting central banker can be seen as yielding to pressure from a politician facing a difficult re-election. A central bank that appears to be subservient to political concerns will rapidly lose credibility in the markets, resulting in increases in inflation expectations and rising long-term rates of interest. As we at the US Treasury used to remind White House political staff during the Clinton administration: \u201cFed bashing is a fool\u2019s game.\u201d\n\nThe Fed does not cut short rates and the market raises long rates. The sense that policy is being politicised increases uncertainty, which is likely to affect investment and slow growth.\n\nSo Mr Trump is surely making a serious error in his rhetorical approach to the Fed. Two questions remain. First, how rapidly should the Fed raise interest rates in coming months? Second, recognising that public Fed bashing is wrong, what should the nature of relations between the central bank and the executive branch be? On neither question does orthodox thinking seem quite right to me.\n\nOn the first question, it seems that there is considerably more danger of the Fed raising rates too fast than too slowly over the next year. Inevitably, monetary policy is a judgment about competing risks. If the Fed raises rates too slowly, inflation will accelerate and remain clearly above the 2 per cent target for a significant interval. This does not seem like it should be a dominant worry. Inflation has been below the target level for a decade, so above-target inflation is necessary if inflation over the long term is to average 2 per cent.\n\nEven with good luck and good policy, a recession will come along at some point and pull down the inflation rate. Two months ago it might have been reasonable to worry about complacency in asset markets, but in light of recent volatility this seems a lower order problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the risks of excessive tightening seem substantial. Monetary policies affect the real economy with lags of a year or more. It is therefore very easy for policy to tighten past the point where the economy is thrown towards recession because of an absence of clear signals of slowing. Indeed, on almost every occasion in the past 50 years when the Fed has tightened in a sustained way, the result has been recession. The risks of a downturn now are greater than at any point in living memory because, given the zero lower bound on interest rates, the Fed would have limited room for easing and, because of the populist and protectionist pressures, that would almost certainly accompany a downturn. Caution should be the order of the day.\n\nSecond, there is a need for pragmatism regarding the independence of central banks. It is important that they resist the kind of pressure for inflationary policy that Mr Trump has recently engaged in. But it is foolish to suppose that a nation\u2019s financial policies should be conducted independently of its elected officials.\n\nConsider some examples. During the period of quantitative easing following the financial crisis, the US Treasury was pursuing a strategy of extending the duration of American government debt. At the same time, in order to pursue stimulus, the Fed was operating in the opposite direction, in effect issuing short-term debt and buying long-term debt. Surely a co-ordinated policy would have reduced transaction costs and served the public interest?\n\nOr take exchange rates, which are objects of international diplomacy and are determined in substantial part by monetary and reserve management policies. Should elected governments with responsibility for foreign affairs have to be removed from exchange rate policy in the service of central bank independence?\n\nOccasions when interest rates are constrained by a zero or near-zero floor are likely to recur in the future. In such circumstances, co-ordination of fiscal and monetary policies may be necessary. This is very difficult if central bank policy is entirely independent of budget policy. The point is not that central banks should be made more subject to political pressure. That is Mr Trump\u2019s bad idea. It is that, as their activities expand beyond pure monetary policy, there will be a need for co-ordination with elected government.\n\n\n\nThe writer is Charles W Eliot university professor at Harvard and a former US Treasury secretary", "As of today, the United States has reimposed sanctions on Iran's oil industry in an effort to cut off their main source of revenue and drive them back to the negotiating table over a nuclear deal which Donald Trump has described as the worst in history.\n\nThe Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.\n\nWhat's happened so far, though, for the oil price has been interesting, however. A month ago, prices hit a four-year high of $86 a barrel as people panicked about the fact of cutting Iran's exports could leave the market short of supplies. Since then, however, the oil price has fallen by almost 17 per cent, taking it to the cusp of a bear market. The reason for that, which may seem counterintuitive at a time when sanctions are coming into effect, is that the US has put pressure on many of its allies, including Saudi Arabia, to ramp up production to try and fill the gap from Iran.\n\nThey've also issued waivers for Iran's oil exports to its countries, which will allow them to take a limited amount of oil for six months, partly to avoid the fears that it could create a shortage in the market and therefore damage the global economy. The big question for the oil price now is just how big the waivers the US have issued are. They've not yet given clarity on how big the size of the cuts they are going to be asking from consumers are going to be, so if that turns out to be smaller than perhaps the market expects, it could put a floor under the oil price.\n\nThe second big question for oil markets is whether having pushed Saudi Arabia and other countries to ramp production close to the maximum level they can do in a short space of time, whether or not people in the market are going to start worrying about the lack of spare capacity now left over, in order if there's another supply outage somewhere else, or if we continue to see a greater drop in supplies from countries like Venezuela, whether or not they'll be spare capacity in the market to fill that gap. That may make for very nervous and volatile trading in the coming weeks.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "New to the Financial Times?\n\nEnjoy 7 days of free access with a Guest Pass", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "With an unmatched number of scoops, Brexit has become our most read and commented-on topic since the referendum.

Sign up to receive a daily digest of the big issues straight to your inbox.\n\nAmerica is heading to the polls on Tuesday for what many think are the most crucial midterm elections in recent memory. Will the Democrats succeed in turning their anger against President Donald Trump into a \u201cblue wave\u201d by taking control of the House of Representatives? Or will the president\u2019s caustic rhetoric on security, borders and migration galvanise his voting base?\n\nRana Foroohar argues in her latest column that whatever the outcome, the post-election challenges for the Democrats will mirror those facing big corporations. The party will be under pressure to define its purpose and posture when capitalism and liberal democracy remain in crisis. Even as the US economy continues to do well, the cultural issues that divide the country and define its politics will continue to grow.\n\nNick Butler pays tribute to Jeremy Heywood, the former British cabinet secretary who was a public servant of the highest quality. Former Labour minister Andrew Adonis has written our obituary.\n\nWolfgang M\u00fcnchau thinks that Friedrich Merz is the conservative disrupter in the race to replace Angela Merkel.\n\nSteven Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, writes that renewed sanctions will push Iran towards a better nuclear deal.\n\nDevesh Kapur argues that the battle between India\u2019s central bank and the government has deep roots. Attacks on the RBI are one example of its politicians undermining institutions.\n\nJamie Dimon of JPMorgan writes that business must do more in more places to help people\u2014 particularly to improve access to training for good jobs.\n\nWhat you\u2019ve been saying\n\nAlternatives to plastic are available \u2014 but food manufacturers must take responsibility\u2014 letter from Miguel Campos:\n\nUnlike some reports suggest, a shift from plastic packaging does not require masses of innovation \u2014 viable alternatives are already available. Materials such as glass and aluminium are indefinitely recyclable, yet are widely under-used. There is a common misconception that alternative materials cannot provide the same protection as plastic, but that is untrue. Smoothwall foil trays, for instance, can be gas flushed or vacuum packed, extending the shelf-life of products as effectively as plastic.\n\nComment from eomurchu on Britain and Ireland still misunderstand each other on Brexit:\n\nOne obvious step for Ireland would be to redefine its own relationship with the EU. There is minimal support presently for this, but Associate membership could perhaps allow Ireland access to the EU market and access to a trade deal with Britain. Such a step, however, is not encouraged by the blatant contempt for Ireland shown by Rees-Mogg, Johnson and others. The other obvious step is for the British Government to face down the DUP. Demographics show that there will be a non-Unionist majority in Northern Ireland within perhaps 20 years, so why rule out a border in the Irish Sea now when it could solve so many of Britain\u2019s problems? Instead, it looks as if Britain will pay a high price for indulging the sectarian ascendancy illusions of the DUP.\n\nCosts are behind the move to plastic packaging\u2014 letter from Gregg A Spindler:\n\nThis shift occurred because of costs; plastic has become cheap. In the US, the fracking boom has produced an enormous glut of natural gas liquids, which provide the feedstocks for making plastics. Shell, for instance, is building a $6bn plant that will produce 1.6m metric tons of the plastic polyethylene every year, provided with $1.65bn in tax credits from the state of Pennsylvania. There are many other such plants newly operating or under construction. The resulting plastics will be use somewhere and for something, most likely finding their way into consumer packaging and products that eventually are disposed of in some way.\n\nToday\u2019s opinion\n\nThe battle between India\u2019s central bank and the government has deep roots\n\nAttacks on the RBI are one example of politicians undermining institutions\n\nThese midterms mark a culture shift for business and politics\n\nThe post-election challenge for Democrats is not unlike that for many corporations\n\nBusiness must do more, in more places to help people\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s investment promises to improve access to training needed for good jobs\n\nFriedrich Merz: conservative disrupter in the race to replace Merkel\n\nDeparting from the path set by the chancellor could put the CDU back on track\n\nJeremy Heywood was a British public servant of the highest quality\n\nThe former cabinet secretary grasped the importance of science and research\n\nRenewed sanctions will push Iran towards a better nuclear deal\n\nThe US Treasury secretary argues tough pressure is necessary to curb the regime\n\nAnnoying self-promoters are not welcome in my inbox\n\nWanton puffery on social media has normalised bragging at work\n\nFT View\n\nThe FT View: The precarious autonomy of India\u2019s central bank\n\nModi is rash to politicise the RBI ahead of next year\u2019s polls\n\nThe FT View: A rancorous America goes to the polls\n\nDo not count on the midterm elections to tame President Donald Trump\n\nThe Big Read\n\nThe Big Read: How to power India: Modi tweaks the energy mix\n\nAmid a surge in oil demand and an investment boom, New Delhi needs to weigh consumer aspirations with fears about pollution", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "With an unmatched number of scoops, Brexit has become our most read and commented-on topic since the referendum.
