Thielen has already set all kinds of records this year for Minnesota. He couldn't do it without teammate Stefon Diggs, though. This dominant wide receiver duo is a major reason why the Vikings remain in the mix with the NFC's top contenders despite some rough spots in the first half of the season. (AP Photo/Bruce Kluckhohn, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEAGAN, Minn. (AP) \u2014 Thanks to Adam Thielen, Minnesota's record book has already needed several revisions this year.\n\nJust past the midpoint of the schedule for the Vikings, Thielen leads the NFL in receptions (78) at a pace that would fall four short of the all-time single-season mark (143). He leads the league with 947 yards. Kirk Cousins, the new prize quarterback with the annual $28 million salary cap hit, without prompting recently called Thielen the best player on this standout-laden team.\n\nThe accolades of this magnitude might not exist for Thielen, though, without Stefon Diggs.\n\nThielen and Diggs are the only teammates currently in the top 10 in the league in catches, on pace for a combined 242. That would break the record for receptions by a pair of teammates, set in 1995 by Herman Moore and Brett Perriman for Detroit with 231.\n\nOpposing defenses are naturally less likely to apply double coverage on Thielen when Diggs is in a pattern at the same time, as evidenced by contrast in a victory over the Lions last week . With Diggs sidelined by a rib injury, Thielen didn't have much space. He used one of his textbook double moves to beat cornerback Nevin Lawson for a short touchdown , his seventh of the year, but he finished with only 22 yards for his lowest total since the 2016 season.\n\nThe mutual benefit of this dominant wide receiver duo, though, began on the practice field years ago.\n\n\"We're always competing, we're always having fun, and we're always giving each a hard time if we're not performing at the level we know we can,\" Thielen said.\n\nIf Thielen makes a catch in practice, Diggs will often make it a point to create even more separation from the defender the next time he's assigned to run the same route. That, in turn, frequently triggers playful yet spirited banter between the two.\n\n\"He's my brother. He's a guy I love messing with, love having fun with,\" Thielen said. \"He's even one of my best friends.\"\n\nAt a position that has long produced some of the NFL's biggest personalities, in some cases breeding a disruptive brand of selfish and boorish behavior, Thielen and Diggs are the anti-divas. Part of that is a product of their route, no pun intended, to the league.\n\nThielen was the NCAA Division II player who went undrafted and needed a rookie tryout camp to make the team five years ago. He didn't become a full-time starter until 2016. Diggs was the fifth-round draft pick who was a healthy scratch for his first three NFL games in 2015.\n\n\"All the cute stuff, like records being broken and stuff like that, you like it and it's good to hear, but we always want to win,\" Diggs said. \"We worry about the win column more than anything. So to see good things happen? Yes, it's exciting. Yes, you congratulate your guys, because guys work extremely hard, you know? So it's always good stuff, and it's good stuff moving in the right direction, but we want to win.\"\n\nThe Vikings (5-3-1) have been doing that more lately after a rough first quarter of the season, entering their bye week a step behind Chicago (5-3) in the NFC North, with a prime-time matchup with the Bears up next on Nov. 18.\n\nCousins has been as advertised, ranking in the top 10 in the league in most of the passing categories, including third in completion percentage despite being prone to a costly turnover here and there. The offensive line has again shown vulnerabilities, though, and the Vikings have averaged the fourth-fewest rushing yards in the league.\n\nThielen and Diggs have been all the more valuable to the Vikings this fall, with an assist by new offensive coordinator John DeFilippo for aggressive and creative play calling that has helped spring them open so much.\n\n\"He uses his playmakers, and he just lets them play. So I admire that, and I appreciate that,\" Diggs said. \"As a player you just want to do the best that you can, and it's good that he plays to your strengths.\"\n\nThe defense, which led the NFL in fewest yards and points allowed last year, was surprisingly one of the biggest problems in September. After that humbling loss in Los Angeles to the Rams dropped the Vikings to 1-2-1, though, coach Mike Zimmer has helped steer the group back into dominant form.\n\nWith daunting road trips to Chicago, New England and Seattle looming over three of the next four games, the pressure will be on the offense to do its part.\n\n\"When you look at it glass half-full, I'm thrilled about our locker room, the chemistry we have on this team, the quality of teammates, the quality of leadership we have in this organization. I think all that has probably even exceeded expectations from me,\" Cousins said. \"Certainly would have loved to be better than 5-3-1, but I'm grateful we're not 3-5-1. You can look at it both ways. The point is, we keep saying, everything is in front of us.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Chicago Bears have a rare opportunity to beat the Detroit Lions and pick up a victory over an NFC North opponent when the two teams meet at Soldier Field on Sunday. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) \u2014 The Chicago Bears have a rare opportunity to beat the Detroit Lions and pick up a victory over an NFC North opponent.\n\nAs accomplishments go, those seem rather modest. Then again, consider their recent history.\n\nThe division-leading Bears have a chance to check off two more boxes when they host the struggling Lions on Sunday.\n\nThey have lost nine of the past 10 games against Detroit and have dropped 10 in a row to division opponents heading into their matchup at Soldier Field.\n\nSince the start of the 2014 season, Chicago is 4-21 against the NFC North. But these Bears aren't those Bears.\n\nChicago (5-3) hit the halfway mark with its best record in five years and sole possession of the NFC North lead for the first time since 2013. It's a big change for a franchise with four straight last-place finishes. But the Bears have already matched their win total from last year and are making a push for their first playoff appearance since the 2010 team advanced to the NFC championship game.\n\n\"There's just so much ball left,\" said coach Matt Nagy, in his first season. \"For our team, we've won in different ways and we've lost in different ways. I think we've kind of learned different ways to do it. And when you lose, you try to figure out why and how to not let it happen again. When you win, you figure out why and how you can always improve and be better. I like where we're at, but we understand we have a ways to go.\"\n\nChicago is coming off back-to-back wins over two struggling teams, with a 41-9 blowout at Buffalo after beating the New York Jets at home.\n\nDetroit (3-5) has dropped two in a row and last week's 24-9 loss at Minnesota was particularly ugly. Matthew Stafford got sacked 10 times, and the Lions were held to single digits in points for the first time since a 17-6 loss to the New York Giants on Dec. 18, 2016.\n\nThey also traded wide receiver Golden Tate to Philadelphia prior to the Vikings game, and they fired special teams coordinator Joe Marciano on Monday night.\n\n\"Definitely have to learn from some of those things that we've done in the past that haven't been up to par or haven't been good enough, and try to minimize those or eliminate them as we go forward,\" coach Matt Patricia said. \"That's the most important thing.\"\n\nHere are some things to know about the matchup:\n\nON THE MEND\n\nThe Bears might get star outside linebacker Khalil Mack (ankle) and top receiver Allen Robinson (groin) back from injuries.\n\nBoth players missed the past two games. But they went through full practices on Wednesday. Tight end Adam Shaheen might also return from a foot injury he suffered in the preseason.\n\nANSAH BACK\n\nThe Lions got a boost last week with the return of defensive end Ziggy Ansah.\n\nHe had a sack in the second quarter that forced the Vikings to settle for a field goal, after missing six games because of a shoulder injury. Having Ansah back means more pressure on the quarterback and maybe better luck stopping the run. The Lions rank 30th in that area.\n\n\"We've just got to set an edge and whoever has got a gap to be in, they've just got to be in there,\" Ansah said. \"Just play fundamental and be able to execute.\"\n\nFAMILIAR FOES\n\nThe Bears are about to meet the Lions twice in a 12-day span, with a Thanksgiving matchup at Ford Field and a primetime Sunday game against Minnesota at home in between.\n\nThis three-game run facing the NFC North comes after four in row against the AFC East. Chicago hasn't played a division team since a 24-23 season-opening loss at Green Bay, when it blew a 20-point lead against an injured Aaron Rodgers.\n\nSTRUGGLING STAFFORD\n\nAfter a solid stretch, Stafford has struggled a bit the past two weeks with 13 sacks and a 90.3 rating. He had ratings above 100 in each of the previous five games.\n\n\"He's been with the Lions for all of his career and he has a great group of receivers, and for some reason they're not putting games together,\" Bears cornerback Prince Amukamara said. \"But they're still a great team and I know for a fact we won't take them lightly.\"\n\nGETTING OFFENSIVE\n\nWhile a defense that ranks fifth overall has gotten much of the credit, the Bears insist their offense is doing its part.\n\nThough Trubisky has been wild at times, his rating (96.1) is similar to Stafford's (96.5). Chicago also ranks fifth in the NFL in scoring.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It goes into how A-Rod saw the success a juiced-up Manny, who would get hit with a 50-game suspension for PEDs, had with the Dodgers and asked Bosch to get him on that program. It goes into how A-Rod hit three home runs in a game against the Royals shortly after starting treatments with Bosch. It goes into A-Rod\u2019s battle with MLB to try to get his season-plus long suspension overturned. It goes into Rodriguez paying protesters in pizza to show up outside of MLB\u2019s NYC offices on the day of the arbitration hearing when he infamously kicked over a lawyer\u2019s briefcase before storming out of the room.\n\n\u201cOur effort (in telling the story) isn\u2019t to remind everyone what an a\u2014\u2014 (Rodriguez) is,\u201d Corben said, \u201cit\u2019s just to tell the truth in what happened in the story.\u201d\n\nBut much like Corben\u2019s other work, the tone of the film is done in such a fun way that it\u2019s hard to look away from it during the 90-plus minutes that it lasts.\n\n\u201cWe were looking to create Coen brothers-esque experience of telling a quirky tale about a wild cast of characters\u2026 and highlighting the absurdity of it all was the goal,\u201d Corben told For The Win this week. \u201cThe idea I came away from it [is], \u2018These are the new values of America.\u2019 That\u2019s something I walked away with in the middle of some interviews we did during filming and seeing how Alex and MLB behaved. While it seems like a uniquely Florida story, it struck me as reflecting values of America now, ones that I think are warped and misguided. In the end, (the story) kind of had a \u2018crime paid\u2019 aspect to it. MLB and Alex ended up winning. The rich got richer and the poor got poorer and that\u2019s so America 2018.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certain that this is a documentary that MLB and A-Rod would rather you not see, I\u2019m certain of that,\u201d Corben said.\n\nThe story is mostly told through first-hand accounts of two key guys, who happen to be two classic characters from the Miami area \u2014 Tony Bosch, the founder and owner of Biogenis who was also the fake doctor who controlled and oversaw all the players\u2019 PED programs, and Porter Fisher, a South Florida resident who loved tanning salons and Bosch\u2019s ability to make him look buff.\n\nBut what makes this documentary so unique and enjoyable is that Corben used child actors to play out all the characters in the story, lip-synching the lines being told by Bosch and Fisher. Here\u2019s a taste of the film, make sure you stick around for A-Rod at the end of this:\n\nCorben didn\u2019t go into this thinking he would have child actors being in it at all, but that the idea struck him one day during during filming.\n\n\u201cWhile watching the interviews of Tony and Porter I noticed the way they both were very moment-by-moment in the way they tell a story,\u201d Corben said. \u201cThey provide the step-by-step dialogue and so I was like, \u2018OK, we can Drunk History this.\u2019 And then it struck me how every single adult in this story acted like a child. Every single one of them. I was like here\u2019s our idea. It was a perfect story for it.\u201d\n\nWhile many players (Manny, Melky Cabrera, Bartolo Colon, and others) used Bosch\u2019s services, A-Rod acted much differently and therefore plays a larger role in the film.\n\n\u201cThe only reason why Alex is in the movie even more than the others is he appealed the suspension and went on to that arbitration,\u201d Corben explained. \u201cEveryone else just took their lumps because they were guilty. They didn\u2019t want to drag it out any longer than necessary. Alex just didn\u2019t know how to admit he was wrong. That\u2019s the most troubling thing \u2014 and \u2018Trumpian\u2019 thing about it, too \u2014 he was incapable of admitting that he was wrong. He was incapable of admitting that he made a mistake or that he cheated. It was just like, \u2018No, I didn\u2019t do this.\u2019 And I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s ever said out loud, \u2018Yes, I did do this.\u2019 He\u2019s joked about it and I guess he\u2019s apologized in some obscure interviews that he\u2019s done more recently but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever admitted that \u2018Every single thing I said no to and denied \u2014 I did all of that.\u2019 And yet he is this beloved and pop-culture figure now.\u201d\n\nSo does Corben think all of these details will make people look at A-Rod any differently after seeing the film? In a word, no.\n\n\u201cEverybody remember how much of an a\u2014\u2013 he was and nobody cares now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have new values in this country. When we were kids we were taught core values to a happy, healthy and successful life \u2014 honesty, integrity, treating other people the way we would want them to treat us. And now it\u2019s like, lie, cheat, and steal and that\u2019s how you get successful and that\u2019s how you get ahead. And those are sort of the new core American values and that\u2019s what we\u2019re teaching our children. And I think that\u2019s how MLB behaved, that\u2019s how Alex behaved \u2014 lie cheat and steal and you can become president of the United States. I think that\u2019s the message we\u2019re sending to our children. Those are America\u2019s new core values for happiness and success so I don\u2019t really see what difference this movie will make in terms of his reputation now \u2013 everyone knows what he did and that he lied to everybody with impunity and that he tried to cover it up with impunity. I don\u2019t think the way MLB behaved was that much better, it might have been worse, in fact. I think that might surprise more people than the Alex part of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cScrewball\u201d will teach you things that you didn\u2019t know, or maybe details you forgot about the steroid-era in baseball. And it does it all in fun, brilliant ways. It\u2019s also a wild story with so many different characters that could really only take place in the state where Corben was born, raised, and resides.\n\n\u201cFlorida rarely shocks me but it regularly disappoints me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is one of those cases where we might have crossed that threshold.\u201d", "Billy Corben, the famed documentary filmmaker behind such hits as \u201cCocaine Cowboys\u201d and ESPN\u2019s 30 for 30 \u201cThe U,\u201d is back with a new film and it\u2019s one he doesn\u2019t think MLB and Alex Rodriguez will be rushing out to see.\n\n\u201cScrewball,\u201d which premiers this Saturday at Doc NYC and will likely have a wider release as soon as Spring 2019, takes you on a fun trip back to when performance-enhancing drugs were all the rage in MLB and provides incredible details about A-Rod\u2019s usage of PEDs (and all the things he did to try to keep it quiet) as well as that of other stars, like Manny Ramirez and Ryan Braun, who also got busted.\n\nThe story dives into what happened after Rodriguez\u2019s memorable press conference at spring training in 2009 when he admitted to using PEDs in the past and said that everyone should take his word on it that he wouldn\u2019t use them again and to judge him on his actions from that day going forward.

The rich got richer and the poor got poorer and that\u2019s so America 2018.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certain that this is a documentary that MLB and A-Rod would rather you not see, I\u2019m certain of that,\u201d Corben said.\n\nThe story is mostly told through first-hand accounts of two key guys, who happen to be two classic characters from the Miami area \u2014 Tony Bosch, the founder and owner of Biogenis who was also the fake doctor who controlled and oversaw all the players\u2019 PED programs, and Porter Fisher, a South Florida resident who loved tanning salons and Bosch\u2019s ability to make him look buff.\n\nBut what makes this documentary so unique and enjoyable is that Corben used child actors to play out all the characters in the story, lip-synching the lines being told by Bosch and Fisher. Here\u2019s a taste of the film, make sure you stick around for A-Rod at the end of this:\n\nCorben didn\u2019t go into this thinking he would have child actors being in it at all, but that the idea struck him one day during during filming.\n\n\u201cWhile watching the interviews of Tony and Porter I noticed the way they both were very moment-by-moment in the way they tell a story,\u201d Corben said. \u201cThey provide the step-by-step dialogue and so I was like, \u2018OK, we can Drunk History this.\u2019 And then it struck me how every single adult in this story acted like a child. Every single one of them. I was like here\u2019s our idea. It was a perfect story for it.\u201d\n\nWhile many players (Manny, Melky Cabrera, Bartolo Colon, and others) used Bosch\u2019s services, A-Rod acted much differently and therefore plays a larger role in the film.\n\n\u201cThe only reason why Alex is in the movie even more than the others is he appealed the suspension and went on to that arbitration,\u201d Corben explained. \u201cEveryone else just took their lumps because they were guilty. They didn\u2019t want to drag it out any longer than necessary. Alex just didn\u2019t know how to admit he was wrong. That\u2019s the most troubling thing \u2014 and \u2018Trumpian\u2019 thing about it, too \u2014 he was incapable of admitting that he was wrong. He was incapable of admitting that he made a mistake or that he cheated. It was just like, \u2018No, I didn\u2019t do this.\u2019 And I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s ever said out loud, \u2018Yes, I did do this.\u2019 He\u2019s joked about it and I guess he\u2019s apologized in some obscure interviews that he\u2019s done more recently but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever admitted that \u2018Every single thing I said no to and denied \u2014 I did all of that.\u2019 And yet he is this beloved and pop-culture figure now.\u201d\n\nSo does Corben think all of these details will make people look at A-Rod any differently after seeing the film? In a word, no.\n\n\u201cEverybody remember how much of an a\u2014\u2013 he was and nobody cares now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have new values in this country. When we were kids we were taught core values to a happy, healthy and successful life \u2014 honesty, integrity, treating other people the way we would want them to treat us. And now it\u2019s like, lie, cheat, and steal and that\u2019s how you get successful and that\u2019s how you get ahead. And those are sort of the new core American values and that\u2019s what we\u2019re teaching our children. And I think that\u2019s how MLB behaved, that\u2019s how Alex behaved \u2014 lie cheat and steal and you can become president of the United States. I think that\u2019s the message we\u2019re sending to our children. Those are America\u2019s new core values for happiness and success so I don\u2019t really see what difference this movie will make in terms of his reputation now \u2013 everyone knows what he did and that he lied to everybody with impunity and that he tried to cover it up with impunity. I don\u2019t think the way MLB behaved was that much better, it might have been worse, in fact. I think that might surprise more people than the Alex part of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cScrewball\u201d will teach you things that you didn\u2019t know, or maybe details you forgot about the steroid-era in baseball. And it does it all in fun, brilliant ways. It\u2019s also a wild story with so many different characters that could really only take place in the state where Corben was born, raised, and resides.\n\n\u201cFlorida rarely shocks me but it regularly disappoints me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is one of those cases where we might have crossed that threshold.\u201d", "FILE - In this Nov. 16, 2017, file photo, baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred speaks during a news conference at the annual MLB owners meetings in Orlando, Fla.

(Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Lawyers for a witness cited for contempt in the Russia investigation asked a federal appeals court to upend the probe on Thursday, arguing that Robert Mueller should never have been appointed to run it.\n\nLawyers for witness Andrew Miller, an associate of Roger Stone, argued that federal law doesn\u2019t permit the Justice Department to hand broad law enforcement power to an outside lawyer, and that officials within the department hadn\u2019t supervised him closely enough.\n\nMueller\u2019s office argued that federal law \u2013 and federal courts \u2013 have long approved of that practice.\n\nFour lower-court judges already have rejected five similar challenges to Mueller\u2019s authority. But Thursday\u2019s argument was the first time it had been presented to a federal court of appeals.\n\nThe three judges on the panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit gave no indication that they had been persuaded. No deadline was set for a decision.\n\nJudge Karen Henderson told lawyers to argue the case as if the firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions hadn\u2019t occurred Wednesday, and that more written arguments may be required.\n\n\u201cWe will most likely be asking for supplemental briefing,\u201d Henderson said.\n\nSessions had recused himself from the Russia investigation after working on Trump\u2019s campaign. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller in place of Sessions, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 for investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nCLOSE Matthew Whitaker was previous Jeff Sessions' chief of staff. Sessions submitted his resignation on Wednesday, one day after the 2018 midterm elections. USA TODAY\n\nTrump has criticized Mueller\u2019s investigation repeatedly as a \u201cwitch hunt.\" The case was argued literally the day after Trump replaced Sessions with Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who has said Mueller should limit his investigation.\n\nThe panel heard more than an hour of arguments involving a contempt citation issued in August for Miller, who refused to testify before a grand jury. Miller served briefly as an assistant to Stone, a longtime associate of Trump, reportedly handling media interviews during the 2016 campaign.\n\nMiller\u2019s lawyer, Paul Douglas Kamenar, argued that prosecutors have some of the most powerful jobs in government because of their authority to indict and imprison. The power shouldn\u2019t be granted to a special counsel, a post created in regulation rather by Congress in statute, he said.\n\nTo hold such power, the post should be appointed by the attorney general rather than the deputy attorney general acting in his place, Kamenar said. And to exercise that power, Rosenstein should have more direct supervision over Mueller than receiving occasional reports, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no real supervision going on,\u201d Kamenar said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this case is about: political accountability.\u201d\n\nJames Martin, a lawyer for a Russian company charged with helping to orchestrate a social media campaign targeting the 2016 election, Concord Management and Consulting LLC, urged the court to rule that Congress had never authorized the hiring of special counsels, and that without its permission, any appointment would be invalid.\n\n\u201cThere is no statutory authority for this appointment,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Michael Dreeben, a deputy solicitor who is working on Mueller\u2019s staff, cited laws dating to 1870 allowing for the department to hire special prosecutors that were updated and modified repeatedly. Court decisions repeatedly upheld the post in previous scandals such as Watergate in the 1970s, he said.\n\nCLOSE A neighbor described the gunman in a deadly Southern California shooting as \"an introvert.\" Jennifer Avalos is praying a missing friend is okay, and California Governor-elect Gavin Newsom expressed a \"heavy heart\" over another mass shooting. (Nov 8) AP\n\nThe special counsel post was created by regulation to distinguish it from the more free-wheeling independent counsel that was legislated to operate outside the department, he said. Special counsels report to whoever is acting as attorney general for a case, and they can consult with department lawyers, he said.\n\nDreeben said Mueller couldn\u2019t act \u201cin a free-floating environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe regulation brought everything in-house and was designed to strike a balance\u201d between independence and oversight, Dreeben said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exist on an island.\u201d\n\nHenderson didn\u2019t ask questions during the hearing scheduled for a half-hour that ran longer than an hour.\n\nJudge Sri Srinivasan focused his questions to Kamenar on whether changing the order that appointed Mueller to allow him to be fired more easily would remedy Miller\u2019s concerns.\n\nKamenar argued that only the attorney general could appoint Mueller, not Rosenstein. Previous court decisions mean that Rosenstein \u201ccan handle the investigation part, but not the appointment part,\u201d he said.\n\nSrinivasan also asked Martin whether other posts in the department that aren\u2019t specifically spelled out in statute, such as deputy solicitor general, a post he held before taking the bench, are also unauthorized.\n\nMartin said other statutes allow for appointments such as deputy solicitors general. \u201cThat\u2019s what was missing in this case,\u201d he said.\n\nJudge Judith Rogers questioned the lack of evidence submitted about how much oversight Rosenstein is providing.\n\nShe also questioned Miller\u2019s lawyers about how the department could fill numerous posts that aren\u2019t designated in statute.\n\nNo deadline was set for the panel to make a decision.\n\nMore: Sessions ouster fuels fear Trump is trying to impede Robert Mueller's probe\n\nMore: Who is Matthew Whitaker?

(AP Photo/Janie McCauley) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Aside from that fearsome left-handed swing everybody knew, Willie McCovey provided an example of humility in how he lived for many of his San Francisco Giants teammates year after year.\n\n\"McCovey was our leader,\" Gaylord Perry said as his fellow Hall of Famer was remembered in a celebration of his life Thursday at AT&T Park.\n\nMcCovey died Oct. 31 at age 80 after suffering from ongoing health issues.\n\nHall of Famers, former teammates and winners of the Willie Mac Award named for him attended on a picture-perfect day. McCovey's 44 was written into the infield dirt next to his position at first base.\n\nThe San Francisco Fire Department paid tribute with a spraying show from a boat in his namesake McCovey Cove in the bay beyond the right-field arcade. Bouquets of flowers were left on McCovey's statue across the water.\n\nA first baseman and left fielder who won NL Rookie of the Year in 1959 and MVP 10 years later, McCovey was a .270 career hitter with 521 home runs and 1,555 RBIs in 22 major league seasons, 19 of them with the Giants. He also played for the Athletics and Padres.\n\n\"What he did on the field, everybody knows what he did,\" Hall of Famer Orlando Cepeda said. \"But as a human being, Willie McCovey was very special.\"\n\nMcCovey wore No. 44 to honor Hank Aaron \u2014 who like McCovey grew up in Mobile, Alabama.\n\n\"If there is a second life, I'd like to come back as a major league baseball player,\" McCovey once said.\n\n\"Stretch,\" as he was fondly known, never won a World Series after coming so close. The Giants lost the 1962 World Series to the New York Yankees, dropping Game 7 1-0 when McCovey lined out to second baseman Bobby Richardson with runners on second and third for the final out.\n\n\"Willie's indelible moment happened to be a screaming line drive that found Bobby Richardson's glove in Game 7 of the 1962 World Series,\" Giants CEO Larry Baer said. \"A few feet one way or another, people say, and Willie's legacy rises to a whole different level. Well, I couldn't disagree with that more. Even if that line drive had gotten past Bobby Richardson and driven in the winning run, that one heroic moment would never have defined Willie's legacy. His legacy transcends baseball, transcends his six All-Star appearances, his Rookie of the Year award, his MVP, even his Hall of Fame induction.\"\n\nMcCovey was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1986 after his first time on the ballot.\n\nThose who played with him cherished McCovey for his thoughtful ways both on and off the field. Home run king Barry Bonds called him \"Uncle Mac\" ''because I've always admired him and he's always taught me the game of baseball as much as Willie (Mays) and my dad have,\" Bonds said Thursday.\n\n\"I got to know Willie Mac the man,\" said Felipe Alou, who was roommates with McCovey in the majors, minors and even winter ball in the Dominican Republic. \"We came here in 1958 a bunch of kids. Willie obviously came up in '59, another child, another kid. I have been a very privileged person, I got to play with five Hall of Famer players with the Giants.\"\n\nPast Willie Mac Award winners in attendance included Giants broadcaster Mike Krukow, Dave Dravecky, Buster Posey, Jack Clark, Shawon Dunston, Nick Hundley, Marvin Benard and Mike Felder.\n\nThe honor is voted on by the players, coaches and training staff to recognize the Giants player who most exemplifies McCovey's inspirational ways on the field and in the clubhouse.\n\n\"I have never been around a more humble man and I've never been around someone who lifted up others around him more than himself,\" Dravecky said. \"I've never been around a man who loved so deeply and cared so much about wearing the Giants uniform. For Willie, he showed us the way.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

His 64 was his lowest opening round on tour since a 64 in the 2017 Phoenix Open.\n\n\"It's an amazing resort, Mayakoba. So to be able to bring the family to enjoy some vacation time, it's a bit of a working vacation,\" Kuchar said. \"I had a good time at the office, as well.\"\n\nMost players did, with more than half of the 132-man field in the 60s.\n\nJordan Spieth was not among them. Playing his second straight week in the fall \u2014 and his last tournament before his wedding \u2014 Spieth traded birdies and bogeys and had to settle for an even-par 71, leaving him in need to a good round Friday just to stick around for the weekend.\n\nOne of his former roommates had no such issues.\n\nHickok also played college golf at Texas and lived with Spieth in Dallas until a few months ago, when all the roommates had to find other arrangements as Spieth prepares for his marriage to Annie Verret.\n\nSpieth had his first PGA Tour victory seven months after leaving college early. Hickok toiled on the Mackenzie Tour in Canada, then the Web.com Tour before finally making it to the big leagues. But he says he learns plenty by playing with Spieth at home.\n\n\"I'm reaching out when I'm home and trying to pick his brain a little bit here and there, but really just watching him play, what he does at practice,\" Hickok said.\n\nAmong those in the large group at 65 was Abraham Ancer, whose tie for fourth last week in Las Vegas moved him to No. 98 in the world. That made Ancer the first Mexican golfer to crack the top 100 in the world ranking, and he carried that to his native soil and kept moving in the right direction.\n\nAlso at 65 were Bud Cauley as he returns from a car accident at the Memorial in early June, and defending champion Patton Kizzire, who made back-to-back eagles on the par-5 fifth hole and by holing out on the par-4 sixth.\n\nRickie Fowler was among those at 66.\n\nKuchar has slipped to No. 40 in the world, failed to reach the third round of the FedEx Cup playoffs for the first time in a decade and did not play in the Ryder Cup for the first time in 10 years. He still keeps upbeat on and off the golf course, and decided while in Las Vegas (a tie for 57th) to play Mayakoba.\n\nHis caddie already had other plans, so Kuchar hired a local caddie from El Camaleon.\n\nHis wife, Sybi, also got in on the act. Kuchar was playing with Zach Johnson, whose caddie (Damon Green) became ill from the heat with four holes to play. Kuchar's wife was following along in the gallery and carried Johnson's bag the rest of the way.\n\n\"I knew she had caddied for me before and was friendly with Zach Johnson, and figured she would be good to handle it, and Zach would go easy on her,\" Kuchar said.\n\nKuchar and Johnson live at Sea Island on the Georgia coast.\n\nSpieth was 2 under through eight holes until he dropped three shots over the next eight holes. Going back to an old driver didn't help as he hit only six fairways, making it tough to score for anyone out of the rough.\n\n\"If you're not driving it well, this course is extremely hard,\" Kuchar said. \"If you're driving it well, you can make some birdies, which I was able to do today.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Two-time All-Pro pass rusher Khalil Mack and top receiver Allen Robinson look as if they're just about ready to return after missing the Chicago Bears' past two games because of injuries.\n\nBoth players practiced without limitations Thursday for the second consecutive day.\n\nThe NFC North-leading Bears hope to have them back in the lineup against the Detroit Lions at Soldier Field on Sunday.\n\n\"These are strange deals because, literally, as you're going through it (you're) trying to figure out where they're at on a day-to-day basis,\" coach Matt Nagy said Thursday. \"Where are you at? Can you go 100 percent? Can you not? How do you feel? And we need to take that into consideration and discuss that, which leads up to game time and then how much, if so.\"\n\nRobinson sent strong signals that he intends to play, saying he's \"100 percent\" after a groin injury kept him from playing in victories over the struggling New York Jets and Buffalo Bills. He has 25 catches for 285 and two touchdowns in six games after signing a three-year contract with Chicago in March.\n\nRobinson missed just about all of last season with Jacksonville after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee early in the opener. He was brought along slowly in the preseason as he worked his way back while trying to learn a new system and develop a rapport with quarterback Mitchell Trubisky.\n\n\"I'm feeling great, and I'm definitely anxious to get back out there,\" Robinson said. \"It's been a tough couple weeks, just having to watch the game from the sideline, so I'm excited.\"\n\nMack, who did not make himself available for comment, got off to a huge start with the Bears following a trade from Oakland just before the opener. He had five sacks and four forced fumbles through the first four games. But he suffered an ankle injury early in an overtime loss at Miami on Oct. 14 and was largely a nonfactor the following week when New England beat Chicago at Soldier Field.\n\nMack had not missed a game since Oakland drafted him with the fifth overall pick in 2014, before sitting out the past two. And he still was adjusting to defensive coordinator Vic Fangio's system even though he sure looked dominant before he got hurt.\n\n\"He didn't practice much the two weeks he's missed ... so he's not where he needs to be or where we want him to be,\" Fangio said. \"But he's certainly prepared enough to go out there and play if his ankle will let him.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Successful fantasy owners shouldn't go into victory formation yet, as one bad week or unfortunate injury can change the complexion of the whole season.\n\nThose still pushing for a postseason berth should pull out all the stops without fear. Week 10 brings opportunity for players who have otherwise been disappointments along with a rookie or two who should be used to exploit favorable matchups.\n\nSTART: Jordan Howard, RB, Bears: With four touchdowns in his last three games, Howard is showing signs of finally breaking out of his season-long funk. Howard is no longer a component in the Chicago passing game, but he's averaged 19 touches per game over the past three weeks. Now he faces a Lions run defense that gives up 5.1 yards per carry and is ranked 27th in stopping the run. He's still a long way from the RB1 many envisioned he'd be on draft day, but Howard will fit in most fantasy lineups as a solid RB2 this Sunday.\n\nSIT: Rob Gronkowski, TE, Patriots: Yes, him. Gronkowski hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 1 and has exceeded better than 70 receiving yards just twice after tagging the Texans for 123 yards in the regular season opener. He missed last Sunday's win against the Packers and is questionable for Sunday's game versus the Titans. There are good streaming options available at tight end (Chris Herndon of the Jets, for example) but the days of Gronkowski as a must-start fantasy beast appear to be reaching their end.\n\nSTART: Marquez Valdes-Scantling, WR, Packers: Since joining the starting lineup, Valdes-Scantling is averaging just over nine targets per game and has a pair of 100-yard outings to go along with two touchdowns. Green Bay's pass, pass and pass again mindset makes the rookie a strong WR2 who continues to gain the trust of Aaron Rodgers. He'll keep building his rapport with Rodgers at the expense of a Miami defense that is 25th in receiving yards allowed and 29th in yards per catch allowed. Valdes-Scantling has averaged 21.1 yards per catch, as seven of his 17 receptions have been for 20 yards or longer.\n\nSIT: Derek Carr, QB, Raiders: The optimism about Carr following a strong performance against the Colts was critically shattered after a near-lifeless effort against the 49ers. Things will not get better for Carr, who must contend with a Chargers defense that is a solid 12th in net passing yards allowed and is tied for sixth with 10 interceptions. While Carr has 10 touchdown passes this season, keep in mind that seven of those came in two games. Los Angeles held him to just 14 fantasy points when the two teams met in Week 5.\n\nSTART: Michael Gallup, WR, Cowboys: Dak Prescott has gotten the rookie wideout more involved over the past two games, with 11 of his 28 targets this season coming in that span. He's responded well, catching six passes for 132 yards and a touchdown and will continue his upward trend going against a suspect Eagles pass defense that is 20th in net passing yards allowed. Gallup has shown he doesn't need a lot of targets to make an impact, which makes him an intriguing WR3/flex option.\n\nSIT: Kenny Golladay, WR, Lions: Even with Golden Tate no longer in the lineup, Golladay was a non-factor in last week's loss to the Vikings, catching just three passes for 46 yards on four targets. Things don't get easier for Golladay, who faces a Bears defense that is ninth in fewest net passing yards and is second only to the Dolphins with 14 interceptions. Golladay should see more targets after having a mere seven in his last three games combined, but there's little to feel good about playing him, especially in a PPR format.\n\nSTART: Marcus Mariota, QB, Titans: He's starting to round into shape and comes off his second game of better than 20 fantasy points with a great chance at a third against the Patriots. New England is 28th in net passing yards allowed and have given up 19 touchdown passes and must deal with Mariota's running ability. While he'd be a gamble in standard leagues, Mariota is a good play in deeper leagues. There's a good chance he steps his game up and turns this contest into a high-scoring affair.\n\nSIT: Matthew Stafford, QB, Lions: Stafford hasn't recorded a game of better than 20 fantasy points since Week 4 and after being sacked 10 times by the Vikings last week, his body will go through another brutal afternoon against the Bears, who have 24 sacks along with 14 interceptions. Chicago is ninth in fewest net passing yards, and if the Lions fall behind early, Stafford had better brace for a long afternoon of uncomfortable meetings with Chicago's withering pass rush.\n\nSTART: Aaron Jones, RB, Packers: Sooner or later, the Packers will catch on to giving Jones more than 12-14 carries per game. Sunday would be a good time to do so, as Green Bay gets a Miami defense ranked 31st against the run and allows a healthy 4.6 yards per carry, which bodes well for Jones' six yards per attempt. Yes, there is some disappointment in Jones after his fumble against the Patriots, but there's a great rebound opportunity awaiting any fantasy owner willing to use him as an RB2.\n\nSIT: Wendell Smallwood, RB, Eagles: In fact, avoiding Eagles running backs altogether is a sound move. The backfield by committee style is a fantasy killer, one whose level of pain is increased by facing a Cowboys run defense that is seventh in fewest yards allowed and gives up a mere 3.6 yards per carry.\n\n___\n\nFor more Week 10 fantasy insight and tips, visit RotoExperts: https://rotoexperts.com\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Bulldogs have produced dynamic running backs over the years, from Herschel Walker to Todd Gurley. The trend continues this season with Holyfield and D'Andre Swift. (AP Photo/Bryan Woolston, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATHENS, Ga. (AP) \u2014 When Elijah Holyfield was pondering where he wanted to go to college, he certainly took an interest in history.\n\nSpecifically, Georgia's long lineage of great running backs.\n\n\"It was a very big deal to me. I've watched Georgia football for a long time and I've really loved all the Georgia backs,\" said Holyfield, son of former heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield . \"It had a lot to do with my decision.\"\n\nFrom Herschel Walker through the 1-2 punch of Nick Chubb and Sony Michel, the No. 5 Bulldogs might as well be known as Running Back U.\n\nThey're living up to reputation again with the current backfield duo of Holyfield and D'Andre Swift.\n\nIn last week's pulverizing 34-17 victory over Kentucky , which locked up Georgia's spot in the Southeastern Conference championship game, Swift rushed for 156 yards and two touchdowns, Holyfield tacked on a career-best 115 yards and a score, and the Bulldogs finished with a season-high 331 yards on the ground against one of the nation's top-ranked defenses.\n\nGeorgia (8-1, 6-1, No. 5 CFP) leads the SEC in rushing (233.8 yards per game), carrying on a tradition that goes back as far as 1942 Heisman Trophy winner Frank Sinkwich but really picked up steam with the arrival of Herschel Walker.\n\nWalker, who capped his brilliant career by capturing the Heisman in 1982, is still recognized as the greatest back in school history. But he's had plenty of challengers over past 3\u00bd decades.\n\nSince Walker left school a year early to play in the ill-fated United States Football League, seven Georgia running backs have been picked in the first round of the NFL draft \u2014 an esteemed list that doesn't even include Terrell Davis, who was only a sixth-rounder but went on to a Hall of Fame career with the Denver Broncos.\n\nMore recently, Georgia's pipeline has grown to include Todd Gurley, Sony Michel and Nick Chubb \u2014 who actually were on the same team in 2014 and are all now thriving in the NFL. Gurley stars for the Los Angeles Rams , earning All-Pro honors in 2017 and leading the league in rushing this season. Michel is starting for the New England Patriots as a rookie, while Chubb is getting significant playing time with the Cleveland Browns .\n\nCoach Kirby Smart certainly relies on that heritage when he's trying to persuade a high school running back to sign with the Bulldogs.\n\n\"I think it helps tremendously to have the guys, the history of Robert Edwards, Garrison Hearst, Terrell Davis, I mean Herschel, just back after back after back after back,\" Smart said. \"Now it's probably more prominent than it's ever been because of the stage that Todd is on and what he's been able to do, and Nick and Sony's exposure last year through the national championship game.\n\nWhat does the coach tell prospective backs who are considering Georgia?\n\n\"If you're a premier back in the country and you say, 'I want to go somewhere that I can learn to play in a pro style, catch the ball in the backfield, and I also want to be able to protect so that I can increase my value, and I also want to have durability where I'm not going to be beat up when I come out of there,' there's nowhere better to go,\" Smart replied.\n\nIndeed, Georgia has relied on an abundance of talented running backs the last few seasons.\n\nPrevious coach Mark Richt was able to land Gurley and Keith Marshall in the same recruiting class \u2014 they were dubbed \"Gurshall\" in a nod to Walker \u2014 though Marshall never realized his full potential because of injuries. Richt pulled off another double-coup when he landed Chubb and Michel.\n\nHolyfield, a junior, signed with the Bulldogs even though he knew he'd spend at least one season playing behind Chubb and Michel (and it wound up being two when both stayed through their full eligibility). Swift came aboard last season, even with all those talented backs on the roster. Zamir White, touted as the nation's top prospects, signed with Georgia coming into this season but was sidelined by a knee injury .\n\nHolyfield said the competition for playing time makes everyone better. He leads the Bulldogs with 674 yards rushing, but Swift, who has battled injuries and finally seems to be at full strength, has gained 622 yards. Swift has also been an effective weapon in the passing game with 17 receptions for 161 yards.\n\n\"When you have somebody who's just as good as you playing next to you, it pushes you every single day,\" Holyfield said. \"I know I can't take a day off because he's not going to take a day off.\"\n\nGeorgia faces Auburn (6-3, 3-3) on Saturday in the 123rd renewal of the Deep South's oldest rivalry.\n\nThe Tigers certainly know what they're up against.\n\n\"Swift and Holyfield kind of resemble the backs they've had in the past,\" defensive tackle Dontavius Russell said. \"It's always a challenge.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

(AP Photo/David Richard, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBEREA, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Baker Mayfield has become the NFL's unwanted poster boy for helmet-to-helmet hits.\n\nTwice this season, Cleveland's rookie quarterback has been struck in the head by tacklers during games and both times the officials failed to call a penalty for the obvious infractions.\n\nMayfield's trying not to take oversights personally.\n\n\"They just have to find their consistency,\" he said of the erratic calls. \"With every ref it's different \u2014 how they see it, how they're seeing the plays, momentum with the whistle, when it's blown, stuff like that. So as they continue to try to enforce the same rule, I think the consistency will grow. But right now, that's why you're seeing some confusion.\"\n\nOn Oct. 21 at Tampa Bay, Mayfield slid after a 35-yard run and was drilled from the side by Buccaneers safety Jordan Whitehead, who wasn't flagged but was fined $26,739 fine by the NFL, which acknowledged days after the hit that it should have been a penalty.\n\nLast week, Kansas City safety Ron Parker delivered a glancing blow with his helmet to Mayfield while the quarterback was being wrapped up by defensive tackle Chris Jones. Again, no penalty was called, but Mayfield was forced to leave the game after an independent medical observer called the officials and requested the QB undergo a concussion evaluation.\n\nMayfield passed the test and was allowed to return three plays later. He fought to stay in the game.\n\n\"Yeah. I guess that is the new rule,\" he said. \"I have to come off the field for a checkup.\"\n\nParker could be fined by the league, which announces its weekly punishments on Saturday.\n\nMayfield, the No. 1 overall pick in this year's draft, joked that Parker's hit fortunately didn't do any damage.\n\n\"It would be more frustrating if it hurt,\" Mayfield said. \"I was more frustrated they took me out of the game, to be honest with you. But they're protecting me. They're doing their job. So ultimately what can I complain about?\"\n\nMayfield has sympathy for the officials, who are doing what they can to protect players \u2014 especially quarterbacks \u2014 while presiding over a game that's moving very fast. Mayfield smiled when asked if the officiating was as uneven when he played in college at Oklahoma.\n\n\"No,\" he said, grinning. \"I had a bunch of friends out there, so it was good.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Bruce Irvin has wanted to play for the Atlanta Falcons since he was a kid.\n\nNow that the seventh-year pass rusher is back home and about to make his Falcons debut, Irvin said he won't take this opportunity for granted.\n\nIt's a rebirth for a 31-year-old who acknowledges he made bad decisions as an Atlanta teenager and now gets a chance to rewrite his local legacy.\n\n\"Yesterday it hit me a little bit,\" Irvin said Thursday. \"I know that I look scared but I really was crying yesterday, this is a childhood dream for me. Growing up, watching Michael Vick, and guys like Terance Mathis ... this was always my dream so for me to be able to come and live it out it was a surreal moment and I'm just very fortunate to be an Atlanta Falcon right now.\"\n\nIrvin was cut last Saturday by Oakland, part of a housecleaning with the rebuilding Raiders. He cleared waivers and was a free agent with offers from several teams.\n\nHe never doubted where he wanted to land.\n\n\"My agent said, 'You know everybody thinks you're going to Atlanta,' and I said under my breath, 'Well, they're right,'\" Irvin said. \"So it was no comparison, man. My family is here. My wife is from here. It was a childhood dream.\"\n\nIrvin said life passed him by growing up in nearby Stone Mountain. He watched friends from Stephenson High School \u2014 Perry Riley, Kelvin Sheppard and Jermaine Cunningham \u2014 focus on their football careers while he was getting having run-ins with law enforcement and constantly putting himself in danger.\n\n\"I was out in the streets doing stuff, and those guys were getting four-year scholarships to Florida and LSU and it hurt me,\" Irvin said. \"It hurt me seeing those guys go off, and I was just around here doing God knows what. It was a motivating factor. Look at me now. I outlasted Perry and Jermaine (in the NFL). Sheppard just got on so, but it was a motivating factor. I'm glad that I figured it out and got my head on straight.\"\n\nIrvin returned recently to Stephenson to meet with current students and offer some advice.\n\n\"Like I said, I never played at Stephenson,\" he said. \"I didn't play football since the ninth grade and I didn't play for six years. Going back there and letting those young guys know that anything is possible. You can be in the worst situation and if you surround yourself by the right people and not around a bunch of yes-men, you can make it around anything. So that was the biggest thing.\"\n\nNow Irvin gets to show what he can do on the field. Before his first practice with the Falcons on Thursday, Irvin wanted to show his new teammates he can still be a force in disrupting the quarterback.\n\nIrvin will wear jersey No. 52 when the Falcons (4-4) take a three-game winning streak to (2-6-1). He intends to help Atlanta improve a pass rush that ranks 27th in sacks.\n\n\"I think I bring a lot of swagger, a lot of attitude,\" Irvin said. \"I speak my mind. I talk a lot of mess. Just running around having fun, man. That's the biggest thing in this league. If you're not having fun, it doesn't take you a long way. Me just bringing energy and knowledge to these guys. Just being the best Bruce Irvin I can be every day.\"\n\nThe 6-foot-3, 250-pound Irvin was a first-round draft pick for Seattle out of West Virginia in 2012. He played four seasons with the Seahawks and two-plus with the Raiders, and had 40 sacks. His 15 forced fumbles over that span lead the NFL.\n\n\"Me and DQ can't dwell on what we did in Seattle, going to the Super Bowl and things like that,\" Irvin said. \"It's more about right now and I feel like they needed me. I wanted to be here. I did what I had to do. We made it happen.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Oakland Raiders defensive coordinator Paul Guenther denied there is any friction between him and coach Jon Gruden and said the two remain united in trying to improve a team that has been one of the biggest disappointments in the NFL this season.\n\nOne week after cameras caught the two coaches getting into a heated exchange after a costly blown play in Oakland's 34-3 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, Guenther laughed about the incident and called it a daily occurrence.\n\n\"Jon and I fight every day upstairs, golf course, in the car, whatever it may be,\" Guenther said Thursday. \"That's going to happen every Sunday. It's happened every Sunday, whether it's good or bad. That's just part of our expectations are higher than what we're showing. That's probably going to happen 100 times a game.\"\n\nGuenther's statement echoed comments made earlier this week by Gruden, who joked that the two have bigger disagreements on the golf course.\n\nThe recent sideline exchanges between the coach and his hand-picked defensive coordinator have gotten more attention, however, as the Raiders have struggled through a 1-7 start.\n\nBoth Gruden and Guenther have come under fire from fans and the media.\n\nGruden has been targeted for the team's inconsistent offense and the radical roster changes being made, while Guenther's defense has been bad all season. The Raiders are on pace to give up 6,514 yards and are allowing opponents to gain a league-high 6.8 yards per play.\n\nWhile acknowledging frustration over the situation, Guenther \u2014 who spent the past 13 seasons in Cincinnati and was the Bengals' coordinator from 2014-17 \u2014 downplayed any suggestion of problems between him and Gruden.\n\n\"I love Jon, he's great to work with,\" Guenther said. \"We're really trying to build this thing the right way and we have a vision for it. I know it doesn't look like that right now but I'm confident in what we're doing.\"\n\nThe Raiders have made sweeping changes since Gruden was hired, much of it on the defensive side.\n\nKhalil Mack, the team's top pass rusher and the 2016 Defensive Player of the Year, was traded to the Chicago Bears before the season opener in exchange for a pair of first-round draft picks. Oakland's best run defender, Justin Ellis, was lost to injured reserve with a foot injury he suffered in Week 1. Then last week, the Raiders released defensive end Bruce Irvin, one of the team captains.\n\nThose moves and others have forced Guenther to reach deep into the roster for help.\n\n\"That's just part of the business,\" Guenther said. \"Our vision was to bring in some young guys in the draft and we did that and they're playing. Obviously we're going through some growing pains right now with the young guys but hopefully the more and more snaps that they get at the back end of this year going into year two, we're going to see massive improvement out of those guys.\"\n\nStill, Guenther acknowledged it hasn't been easy and said he's had to bite his lip a few times.\n\n\"There are certain things, breakdowns that we're having that we shouldn't have, that I'm not used to seeing,\" Guenther said. \"It is a patience thing but I'm not the most patient guy. I want to get the stuff fixed quickly.

(AP Photo/Matt Marton, File (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEVANSTON, Ill. (AP) \u2014 Northwestern came into the season with its star quarterback limited, lost its top running back early on, dropped three straight games and went winless in nonconference play.\n\nSounds like a recipe for one long season, except take a look at the Big Ten West standings. That's right, the Wildcats lead the lead the division.\n\n\"Yeah, it's been a really unique year,\" coach Pat Fitzgerald said.\n\nThe Wildcats (5-4, 5-1 Big Ten) can clinch the division title and their first appearance in the Big Ten championship simply by winning two of their final three games. They would also secure a spot Saturday with a victory at Iowa plus losses by Wisconsin at Penn State and Purdue at Minnesota.\n\nIt's quite a position for a team that wasn't widely considered a favorite to win its division, though Northwestern is hardly the only surprise in the Big Ten.\n\nWhether it's teams exceeding expectations or traditional powers not quite meeting them, it has been a wild season around the conference.\n\nNo. 8 Ohio State (8-1, 5-1) came into the season as a favorite to reach the playoffs, only to get blown out by Purdue two weeks ago. The Buckeyes also had to rally in the second half and then hang on for a five-point win at Nebraska this past Saturday.\n\nNo. 21 Penn State (6-3, 3-3) also had high expectations. But back-to-back tight losses to Ohio State and Michigan State and a blowout by Michigan last week doused their playoff hopes.\n\n\"Overall, we're disappointed with what happened last week and before that we'd had two other challenging losses by a very, very narrow margin,\" coach James Franklin said. \"Obviously, our team is disappointed whenever we're not successful. ... I think when we look back at the things we've been able to accomplish in our short time here after walking into some challenging circumstances, I think overall I'm excited about the direction.\"\n\nThen there's No. 4 Michigan (8-1, 6-0), picked by some to finish fourth in the Big Ten East behind the Buckeyes, Michigan State and Penn State. The Wolverines instead are a playoff contender and leading their division, with Ohio State second, Michigan State third and Penn State tied with Maryland for fourth place.\n\nIn the West, Wisconsin (6-3, 4-2) and Iowa (6-3, 3-3) haven't performed the way they hoped.\n\nPurdue (5-4, 4-2), looking to build on a bowl victory last season, looked like it was going in the tank with an 0-3 start. But the Boilermakers have won five of six to play their way into the running for the Big Ten West championship. They beat three ranked teams along the way for the first time in 15 years, including that stunning 29-point win over Ohio State.\n\nBuckle up for these next few weeks.\n\n\"We're still three weeks away from really knowing how it's gonna end,\" Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said. \"We're still three weeks away from knowing how it's really gonna end. And there's gonna be a lot of twists and turns, just like the national (race). ... Things are gonna change dramatically between now and the finish line. But that's part of the intrigue of college football.\"\n\nIowa was looking like the most skilled team in the Big Ten West just a few weeks ago with a lengthy list of future pros. But back-to-back losses road losses to Penn State and Purdue have all but knocked the Hawkeyes out of the division race. A loss to Northwestern at home on Saturday would eliminate them.\n\nFor the Wildcats, Iowa would appear to be the final major hurdle.\n\nNorthwestern already has victories over Wisconsin and Purdue, and the final two games on the schedule are against struggling teams \u2014 at Minnesota and home against Illinois. Assuming they don't face-plant in the next few weeks, the Wildcats appear to have a clear path to Indianapolis for the Big Ten title game.\n\nThey're in that spot even though quarterback Clayton Thorson was limited the first few weeks because of a knee injury he suffered at the end of last season. No. 1 running back Jeremy Larkin had to stop playing football after the third game because of a spinal issue.\n\nNorthwestern also dropped three straight home games after the opener, including matchups with Duke and Akron before losing to Michigan. The Wildcats were also beaten by Notre Dame at Ryan Field last week, making them 0-3 in nonconference play.\n\nHad someone told Fitzgerald before the season that Northwestern would be in position to win its division despite all that?\n\n\"I would say that our guys would be pretty resilient, that they battled through adversity and there's no way in the world I could have predicted that,\" he said, laughing.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They're allowing 394 yards per game, more than the team's record-high average of 383 in 2016, the year before Burke became coordinator.\n\nThe Dolphins have allowed 107 points in their past three road games, and now they visit Aaron Rodgers and the Packers , who are ranked sixth in offense.\n\nRodgers, ever the pro, managed to find nice things to say about Miami's defensive, specifically Jones' secondary.\n\n\"They've made a lot of plays on the ball,\" Rodgers said. \"They do a nice disguise package. They play some different coverages behind some of their pressures.\"\n\nThe saving grace for the Dolphins' defense is that they have 15 interceptions, including four last week. They're on pace to the lead the league for the first time in franchise history.\n\nBurke believes that for his defense, the best is yet to come.\n\n\"I hope so,\" he said. \"Hope is not a strategy, but you hope the trend from last week is where we're heading more than weeks prior.

(AP Photo/Larry Papke, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAVONDALE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 The credo in NASCAR has always been \"If you ain't cheatin', you ain't tryin',\" and that has never changed despite series effort to keep things on the up-and-up.\n\nNow that culture has resurfaced again and at a most inopportune time for the beleaguered series.\n\nThere is one race to go to set the championship field, Sunday in Phoenix, and star driver Kevin Harvick has been snared in the latest scandal. NASCAR found Harvick had an illegal race-winning car \u2014 his second of the season \u2014 after his victory at Texas Motor Speedway earned him an automatic berth in the Nov. 18 title race in Florida.\n\nThe issue was with a spoiler that had been modified to give Harvick an aerodynamic advantage as he dominated and won for a Cup Series-high eighth time this season. Just how much of an advantage Harvick had is irrelevant: The levels of deceit NASCAR believes Stewart-Haas Racing went to were so devious the intent can't be questioned.\n\nOnce NASCAR had the car back from Texas and in its Research and Development Center, the spoiler was removed and determined not to be the part supplied by the vendor. Instead, NASCAR believes SHR made its own spoiler, passed it off as one from the mandatory vendor and used it to help Harvick win.\n\nThe details were unveiled late Wednesday, 10 hours after Harvick's spot in the finale was revoked. NASCAR has for several years refused to give specifics about infractions \u2014 keeping secret ideas on how to game the system \u2014 but reversed course on the Harvick penalty because of mounting criticism about the severity of his punishment. Not only did Harvick lose his spot in the final four at Homestead-Miami Speedway, but he must race the final two weeks of the season without his crew chief and car chief.\n\nScott Miller, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said he felt SHR took the notion of pushing boundaries and exploring technology \"into borderline ridiculous territory.\"\n\nWith the stakes so high this weekend at Phoenix, where seven drivers will by vying for three open spots in the championship race, NASCAR will check spoilers at the track.\n\n\"It's unfortunate that now we'll be pulling spoilers off and having to do another inspection when the teams should really be bringing legal cars to the race track,\" Miller said.\n\nSHR has not challenged NASCAR's cheating allegation. The team said it would not appeal the penalty and vice president of competition Greg Zipadelli said in a statement \"NASCAR determined we ventured into an area not accommodated by its rule book.\" The team has not made any members available for comment, and Harvick is not scheduled to speak to the media at Phoenix, where he is a nine-time winner. One of his victories came in the spring, part of a three-race winning streak marred by an illegal car at Las Vegas one week earlier.\n\nThe latest infraction raises questions about whether SHR has \"ventured into an area not accommodated\" by NASCAR's rulebook with its other drivers. Its entire four-car lineup \u2014 Harvick, Kurt Busch, Clint Bowyer and Aric Almirola \u2014 is still eligible for the title race.\n\nIt wasn't just SHR last weekend, either. NASCAR took three cars back to its R&D Center after Texas and all three failed teardown inspections. Ryan Blaney's team was punished and so was the team for Erik Jones.\n\nIf the only three cars inspected failed, what about the other 37 cars in Sunday's field?\n\n\"We certainly can't bring the 40-car field back to R&D,\" Miller said, elaborating on how issues get missed at the track. \"We're under time constraints at the race track to do these inspections. We have small windows and tight windows to get the inspections done, and we might spend in the neighborhood of five minutes with each of the 40 cars for the three-hour window that we have for inspection. To think that we can scrutinize a car as good in five minutes and we can in three hours at the R&D Center is a bit unrealistic.\"\n\nThe last big scandal in NASCAR was in 2013, when Michael Waltrip Racing manipulated the finish of a race at Richmond to try to get Martin Truex Jr. into the playoffs. It led to a larger NASCAR investigation that uncovered at least one other case of race manipulation.\n\nThe latest scandal may be the tipping point for a revamped penalty system next season. Miller said the sanctioning body will look during the offseason at tougher penalties if a team that can't even pass the first round of inspection.\n\n\"We realize that we kind of probably need to ramp up the severity of what goes on at the race track, and we're hoping that we can change the culture to where we don't have to play this cat-and-mouse game with the teams all the time,\" Miller said.\n\nWhat happens if a car fails inspection after winning the title? It wasn't until Wednesday morning, long after Sunday's race, that NASCAR revealed Harvick's car had failed inspection.\n\nMiller vowed intense scrutiny on the four championship-contending cars at Homestead, and said the post-race procedure is similar to the Daytona 500, where engines are examined at the track after the race.\n\n\"Knowing that so much is on the line, we can concentrate on those cars a little bit more than we can the 40-car field during the regular season,\" Miller said. \"So we'll just ramp up the intensity of keeping people with eyes on those cars throughout the weekend and scrutinize those cars heavily, both before and after the race.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Robyn Beck, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Authorities said the Marine Corps veteran accused of gunning down 12 people in California on Wednesday had previously exhibited erratic behavior suggestive of post-traumatic stress disorder, but experts say his actions should not be blamed on PTSD.\n\nIan David Long, 28, is accused of killing 12 people in a country bar in Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not PTSD,\u201d said Barbara Olasov Rothbaum, a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and director of the Trauma and Anxiety Recovery Program at Emory University School of Medicine. \u201cThis is whatever else, what other pathology would cause someone to do this.\u201d\n\nLong was a machine gunner who deployed to Afghanistan in 2010 and was stationed in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, when he left the military in 2011, the Marine Corps said. During his service, he received a Marine Good Conduct Medal and three Navy commendations.\n\nBetween 11 and 20 percent of veterans who served in Afghanistan or Iraq have post-traumatic stress disorder in a given year, VA researchers have said.\n\nVA spokesman Curt Cashour told USA TODAY on Thursday that Long was \u201cnot enrolled in VA health care at any time.\u201d\n\nThis 2017 photo from the California Department of Motor Vehicles shows Ian David Long. Authorities said the Marine combat veteran opened fire Wednesday evening, Nov. 7, 2018, at a country music bar in Southern California, killing multiple people before apparently taking his own life. (Photo: California Department of Motor Vehicles via AP)\n\nHe was described by some as a loner Thursday, according to neighbors and others who reported strange noises coming from the house where he lived with his mother, and law enforcement officials said they had periodic contact with Long over the years. Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said deputies responding to a domestic dispute at his home found he was \"somewhat irate and acting irrationally.\"\n\nRothbaum said in cases where veterans are suffering from PTSD, there can be \u201cirritability and aggression\u201d but nothing that would account for murder.\n\n\u201cI get upset when people get scared of veterans with PTSD because they think they are going to be violent, and they\u2019re not,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere is already so much stigma involved in PTSD in general \u2013 and certainly in veterans and military service members \u2013 that anything else that adds to the stigma would do them a disservice.\u201d\n\nContributing: Tom Vanden Brook, Chris Woodyard, Marco della Cava and Jefferson Graham\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/08/thousand-oaks-shooter-experts-caution-against-blaming-ptsd-military-mass-shooting/1934942002/", "CLOSE The father of Cody Coffman gave an emotional interview after learning his son was one of the 12 victims of the Thousand Oaks shooting in California.

In the absence of any effective policies to separate disturbed individuals from high-powered weapons, officers are rushing headlong into horrific violence in order to save lives.\n\n\"With every second you don't do that, the gunman is going to pull the trigger and somebody is going to die,\" says Peter Blair, professor of criminal justice and executive director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University.\n\nAnd that's just what Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus, 54, did Wednesday night at the Borderline Bar and Grill after a troubled Marine combat veteran opened fire using a semi-automatic, .45-caliber pistol fitted with a high-capacity magazine.\n\nOpposing view: In California, gun control fails once again\n\nHelus and a California Highway Patrol officer didn't wait for backup. They ran toward the gunfire. Helus \u2014 a husband, a father and months from retirement \u2014 was shot and killed. The gunman, perhaps convinced that police were closing in, took his own life.\n\nThousand Oaks joins the sad litany of communities \u2014 Pittsburgh; Santa Fe, Texas; Parkland, Florida; Sutherland, Texas; and Las Vegas \u2014 that have been the scene of double-digit killing sprees in just over a year.\n\nNo matter how many such massacres occur, Americans must never become desensitized to this wanton violence, must never be willing to sigh, clean up the blood and move on.\n\nHelus's sacrifice was not only a random act of full-measure heroism \u2014 which it certainly was \u2014 but was emblematic of a broad change in police tactics in response to the scourge of mass killing.\n\n\"It's a monumental pivot, or a seismic change, in a way,\" says retired police chief Jim Bueermann, president of the National Police Foundation.\n\nAfter the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, where 13 people were killed by two gunmen, police agencies realized that their established practice \u2014 setting up a perimeter and waiting for SWAT teams to arrive \u2014 was costing lives.\n\nArmed with semi-automatic weapons such as assault-style rifles, gunmen can kill too many people too quickly. Agencies began training their officers not to wait, but to enter shooting scenes carefully and quickly.\n\nSo when a gunman armed with an assault-style rifle entered a synagogue Oct. 27 and killed 11 people, four officers who tried to stop him were wounded, one critically. The gunman eventually surrendered.\n\nPoliticians, particularly at the federal level, could respond to these killings with common-sense gun laws that establish universal background checks and ban assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines. (California outlaws both, but both are readily available in neighboring states like Nevada.) But Congress remains paralyzed when it comes to sensibly limiting the nation's growing arsenal of firearms and mass-killing accessories.\n\nSo the rampages continue, and selfless police officers like Sgt. Ron Helus elect to move toward the gunfire to limit the dying, even if it means they might die themselves.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

(AP Photo/Steve Conner) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEven during the years that Fresno State has been a power program in the West, it's never found a way to get the best of Boise State on the blue turf. The only time the Bulldogs have ever beaten the Broncos in Boise, the field was still green.\n\nThis may be the best opportunity for the 16th-ranked Bulldogs to finally end their skid when they face Boise State on Friday night. Fresno State has joined Central Florida and Utah State among the best of the Group of Five teams and the most likely to land in one of the New Year's Six bowl games.\n\n\"I think their team is really good and it's very loud there and it's a hostile environment but the color of the turf, I hope we're not looking down at the turf,\" Fresno State coach Jeff Tedford said.\n\nTaking down the Broncos would provide Fresno State (8-1, 5-0 MWC) with a little bit of redemption for last year's 17-14 loss to Boise State in the Mountain West championship game. More importantly, it would keep the Bulldogs in line for a possible conference title game clash with No. 14 Utah State with the winner potentially landing a big-money bowl opportunity should UCF stumble in the final month.\n\nFresno State has thumped its opponents by an average margin of victory of 32.5 points, but it hasn't faced the best competition yet. The Bulldogs' nine opponents have a combined record of 35-49.\n\nWhile most of the bigger implications involve the Bulldogs, a win by Boise State (7-2, 4-1) would keep the Broncos in line for a matchup with Utah State in the regular-season finale \u2014 also in Boise \u2014 and that could land the Broncos back in the conference title game for the second straight year and third time overall.\n\n\"Just a very good team. Very solid in what they do. And they've been very consistent in what they do week in and week out,\" Boise State coach Bryan Harsin said.\n\nHere are other things to know about the 21st matchup between the schools:\n\nSOMETHING ABOUT MCMARYION: Fresno State QB Marcus McMaryion is quietly having one of the best seasons of any quarterback in the country. McMaryion is ninth in the country in passer rating at 165.4. He's thrown 20 touchdowns against just three interceptions and has added another seven touchdowns running. He struggled last year in the Mountain West title game against Boise State, completing just 16 of 34 passes and throwing an interception in the 17-14 loss.\n\nRYP IT: Boise State quarterback Brett Rypien will likely place himself at the top of the Mountain West all-time passing records against the Bulldogs. Rypien needs 36 yards passing to become the conference's career passing leader. Rypien has 12,655 yards, trailing only San Diego State's Ryan Lindley on the conference all-time list. Rypien also needs just five completions to pass Lindley for the most completed passes in conference history. Rypien has 957 in his career.\n\nSTRENGTH VS. STRENGTH: The Bulldogs bring the No. 1 scoring defense, passing defense and third-down defense to the blue turf to face a Boise State passing attack that is tops in the conference and ranks 11th nationally. The Bulldogs have built their resume stopping the pass against some of the weaker passing teams in the Mountain West. The Broncos will provide a major test for Fresno State's pass defense, which ranks 15th nationally.\n\nINJURY WORRIES: Boise State lost leading tackler Riley Whimpey to a torn ACL suffered in last week's win over BYU. He's the third defensive starter to be lost for the season, joining defensive tackle David Moa and safety DeAndre Pierce.\n\nHOME DOG: Ever since Boise State's run of dominance started in the early 2000s, the Broncos have been overwhelming favorites anytime they're playing at home. It makes Fresno State being a 3-point favorite this week notable. According to Oddsshark.com, the last time Boise State was an underdog at home for a regular-season conference game was Oct. 23, 1999 against Nevada. The Broncos were 2-point underdogs. They beat Nevada 52-17. The Broncos were home underdogs three times in the 1999 season and won all three games.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It was updated after the mass shooting at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California. It has since been corrected to reflect that Australia had a mass shooting in May.\n\nMore than 20 years ago, just weeks after the deadliest mass shooting in Australia's history, the country's then-Prime Minister John Howard made it clear: Australia would not be like the United States.\n\n\"I would dread the thought that this country would go down the American path so far as the possession of firearms,\" said Howard \u2013 at a gun rally.\n\nEach time there's a mass shooting like the one in Thousand Oaks, California, where 12 people were killed at a country-western dance bar, attention turns to Australia and the changes it made to its gun laws two decades ago.\n\nMore on mass shootings: Why the AR-15 keeps appearing at America's deadliest mass shootings\n\nAustralia made sweeping gun control measures after a man killed 35 people with a semi-automatic weapon in a popular tourist area of Port Arthur, in Tasmania. Weeks after the April 1996 tragedy, the country and its states began banning rapid-fire guns to tamp down on mass shootings and then offered to buy the prohibited firearms.\n\nResearch suggests it's worked.\n\nThe University of Sydney, in a 2016 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found Australia hadn't experienced a fatal mass shooting \u2013 one in which five or more people are killed \u2013 since the 1996 shooting. In the 18 years prior, 1979-1996, there were 13 fatal mass shootings in Australia.\n\nHowever, in May 2018, a family of seven including four children was found dead with gunshot wounds at a rural property in southwest Australia. It was the country's worst mass shooting since 1996.\n\nMore on gun control: Do gun control debates change anything? In these countries they did\n\nThe numbers in the 2016 research also showed total firearm deaths in Australia, which had been declining before 1996, dropped more rapidly once the changes were made.

Mahomes is off to a record-setting start as the Chiefs\u2019 first-year starter, while Josh Rosen is coming off a fourth-quarter comeback win over San Francisco. (AP Photo/Orlin Wagner, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 The Patrick Mahomes Reunion Tour rolls on Sunday when the young, record-setting quarterback leads the high-flying Kansas City Chiefs against the Arizona Cardinals at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nLast week, Mahomes shredded the Cleveland Browns while outplaying their rookie quarterback, Baker Mayfield. The two met when Mahomes was being recruited to Texas Tech and Mayfield helped to serve as his host, and their relationship continued even when Mayfield transferred to Oklahoma.\n\nThis week, Mahomes gets to reminiscence about his time working at Peyton Manning's football camp with his old roommate, Josh Rosen \u2014 now the quarterback on whom the Cardinals are pinning their future.\n\n\"I've met him a couple times, been out to California and met him,\" Mahomes said. \"He throws a beautiful ball. It's always a really tight spiral. I know he'll have a lot of success.\"\n\nIt's going to be tough to top the success Mahomes is having.\n\nThe Chiefs' first-year starter is setting benchmarks just about every time he steps on the field, and the next one might be consecutive 300-yard passing games. Mahomes has eight straight to match Andrew Luck from the 2014 season, and he's shown no signs of slowing down.\n\n\"I thought he was pretty good,\" Rosen said, reflecting on those days working camp together. \"We weren't really throwing, we were mostly just coaching the kids. So we didn't get to really throw too much, but I liked him as a dude. We got along really well.\"\n\nRosen hasn't seen a whole lot of Mahomes with the Chiefs (8-1) this week, either, because he's spent all his time focusing on the defense. But Cardinals coach Steve Wilks has seen enough to know that stopping him may be impossible, and slowing him down is nearly as difficult.\n\nThat goes for the entirety of the Kansas City offense.\n\n\"One thing we talked about all week is really trying to limit those big plays, understanding exactly who they're trying to target,\" Wilks said. \"This is a very explosive offense. Going against Andy Reid for several years in different places, going all the way back to the Eagles, this is part of his M.O. So, we've got to try to limit the big plays as much as possible.\"\n\nThe Cardinals (2-6) have struggled much of the season, particularly on offense. But they're coming off an uplifting, fourth-quarter comeback victory over San Francisco that was capped by Rosen's touchdown strike to Christian Kirk in the final minute.\n\n\"You can let point spreads and all these things \u2014 'trap game' \u2014 and all these terms that pop up and things that happen come into it,\" Reid said of perhaps the biggest challenge facing the Chiefs this week. \"But if you can honestly focus on the process and discipline yourself to do that, that normally takes care of things. ... You're not going to let distractions get in the way.\"\n\nAs the Chiefs and Cardinals prepare to meet Sunday, here are some interesting notes:\n\nGETTING HEALTHIER\n\nChiefs safety Daniel Sorensen is expected to play after returning from injured reserve, where he'd been since breaking his leg in training camp. The Chiefs also could have top pass rusher Justin Houston back from a hamstring injury that has sidelined him the past four games.\n\nROSEN AND REID\n\nRosen's father, noted physician Dr. Charles Rosen, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, and the youngster was an avid fan of Reid and the Philadelphia Eagles growing up.\n\n\"I used to have an Eagles shirt when I was a kid that said, 'Our coach will eat yours.' I was a huge Andy Reid fan,\" Rosen said. \"Him and Mike Vick and the DeSean Jackson days were very fun to watch.\n\nFITZGERALD'S NUMBERS\n\nCardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald has been climbing into the upper reaches of the NFL's career receiving marks, and he is closing in on a couple very high rungs.\n\nFitzgerald has 15,902 yards receiving, and he needs 33 more to pass Terrell Owens for second place behind Jerry Rice on the career list. Fitzgerald also needs 58 catches to pass former Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez for second behind Rice in career receptions.\n\nFitzgerald had eight catches for 102 yards and a TD in last week's 18-15 win over San Francisco.\n\nPERFECTION, ALMOST\n\nReid was asked this week how often his creative plays are executed properly \u2014 when all 11 guys do exactly what they are supposed to do. And his answer was quite candid.\n\n\"I'd probably give you 85 percent of the time,\" Reid said. \"Now, they can get beat and that would bring it down a little bit, but mostly guys will attempt to do the right thing. It amazes me how they can digest all this and in a split-second know \u2014 there's 200 plays on that sheet, and you have to figure it out like that, and these guys do it.\"\n\nMAKE WAY, LEN\n\nMahomes already has thrown 29 touchdown passes, which means he needs just two more to pass Len Dawson's franchise record. The Hall of Famer set one of the Chiefs' longest-standing records in 1964, an era in which passing generally took a back seat to running the ball.\n\n\"It would be awesome,\" Mahomes said, \"because Len had a lot of success in the NFL and was kind of ahead of his time, throwing all those touchdowns. It would be awesome to pass that.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The president described the people in migrant caravans as not legitimate asylum seekers. (Nov. 1) AP\n\nMembers of the immigrant caravan arrive at the shelter of the Church of the Assumption in the city of Puebla in Puebla state, Mexico, on Nov. 4. (Photo: HILDA RIOS, EPA-EFE)\n\nThe Trump administration announced a plan Thursday to dramatically cut back immigrants' ability to request asylum in the USA, a direct challenge to federal law and international conventions that the president said is necessary to stop an immigrant caravan slowly making its way to the U.S.-Mexican border.\n\nImmigrants are allowed to request asylum whether they present themselves at ports of entry or sidestep those ports and illegally enter the country. The rules proposed by the administration would bar those who enter illegally from making an asylum claim and place them into expedited deportation proceedings instead, according to a posting by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security on the Federal Register late Thursday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump hinted at such a change in the weeks leading up to Tuesday's midterm elections as part of a broader strategy in which he focused almost exclusively on immigration in an effort to rile up the GOP base. During a news conference four days before the midterm elections, he said there was \"rampant abuse\" of the nation's asylum system, which saw an increase in claims from 5,000 in 2008 to 97,000 in 2018, mostly fueled by Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries.\n\n\u201cOur asylum system is overwhelmed with too many meritless asylum claims from aliens who place a tremendous burden on our resources, preventing us from being able to expeditiously grant asylum to those who truly deserve it,\u201d Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said in a joint statement. \u201cToday, we are using the authority granted to us by Congress to bar aliens who violate (the new rules).\u201d\n\nLee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who led the lawsuit that forced the Trump administration to reunite more than 2,500 immigrant children separated from their parents this summer, said the proposed asylum changes are dubious.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s plan to categorically deny asylum to those who enter between ports of entry is patently unlawful and inconsistent with our nation\u2019s commitment to providing a safe haven to those in danger,\u201d Gelernt said Thursday. \u201cThere will be lawsuits.\u201d\n\nCLOSE Migrant caravans winding their way toward the U.S. are reigniting rhetoric and arguments about immigration and border security. And it's not the first time. USA TODAY\n\nSeveral groups have already filed lawsuits in California and the District of Columbia challenging the administration\u2019s actions to limit asylum. Thursday\u2019s announcement will add to the litigation, which could be decided by a Supreme Court that includes two Trump appointees.\n\nAsylum is a form of protection granted to people who fear persecution in their home countries based on their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or their political opinion. From 2000 to 2016, the United States granted asylum to an average of 26,651 foreigners a year, according to Department of Homeland Security data.\n\nThe 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act states that any foreigner who arrives in the USA, \"whether or not at a designated port of arrival,\" may apply for asylum. A United Nations treaty signed in 1951 by the United States says \"refugees should not be penalized for their illegal entry\" because extreme situations sometimes \"require refugees to breach immigration rules.\"\n\nTo override those rules, the administration used a rationale similar to its argument for its controversial travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries. U.S. law allows a president to sign a proclamation suspending entry to people who are deemed \"detrimental to the interests of the United States.\" Trump is likely to sign a presidential proclamation as early as Friday outlining the asylum restrictions, which would kick-start the new rules.\n\nAs the number of immigrants requesting asylum along the southern border increased in recent years, thousands have had to wait on the Mexican side of the border, sometimes sleeping on bridges and streets, to plead their case. The Mexican government, working with nongovernmental organizations and volunteer groups, created a system by which applicants are signed up and allowed to enter U.S. ports of entry in order.\n\nThose long waits, after even longer journeys to reach the U.S. border, often drive immigrants to enter the country illegally and request asylum that way. When the last caravan reached the USA in April, 401 presented themselves at ports of entry, as the administration has urged them to do, but 122 quit waiting and entered the country illegally to request asylum, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nThursday's announcement follows several other steps taken by the administration to halt the caravan, which Trump described as an \"invasion\" of the country.\n\nThe Pentagon mobilized more than 7,000 active-duty military troops, who started laying miles of concertina wire along portions of the border. U.S. Customs and Border Protection repositioned its agents from throughout the country to line the southern border to prevent illegal entries.\n\nDuring a trip to the border, CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said he viewed the oncoming caravan as a \"law enforcement situation\" and his officers could not speed up the process to interview asylum seekers.\n\nThousands of migrants have been in Mexico City, where they have regrouped and are demanding buses to take them to the U.S.-Mexico border. Mexico City government authorities told The Associated Press that nearly 5,000 migrants are being sheltered in a sports complex, with more than 1,700 migrants under the age of 18, including 310 children under age five.\n\nThe Mexican government told the AP that most of the migrants have refused offers to stay in Mexico, and only a small number have agreed to return to their home countries. About 85 percent of the migrants are from Honduras, while others are from the Central American countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\nContributing: John Fritze in Washington.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/08/trump-administration-suspend-asylum-people-who-cross-border-illegally/1933051002/", "The marquee on the Manor Theatre in the Squirrel Hill section of Pittsburgh, proclaims \"Pittsburgh is Stronger than Hate\", Monday, Oct. 29, 2018, blocks from the Tree of Life Synagogue, where a shooter opened fire Saturday Oct. 27, killing 11 people as they were worshipping.

So when she first learned that the Borderline gunman had been in the Marines and may have suffered from PTSD, she thought immediately: \"Wow, I wish this person had met Dan.\"\n\nMore: What we know about the mass shooting at a Thousand Oaks, California, dance bar\n\nRelated: 'He died a hero': Ventura County Sheriff Sgt. Ron Helus killed in Thousand Oaks shooting\n\nThen a friend texted her the awful news: Manrique died at Borderline, a victim of the gunman.\n\n\"The shooter killed someone who could have been his lifeline, who could have helped him with his PTSD, who could have understood more than anyone what he was going through,\" she said.\n\nIn fact, that's what Manrique was doing that night at Borderline, Bergeron said, \"he was there to support and work with other veterans.\"\n\nThat's what she will remember most about him, his unwavering focus on the future and how that helped his fellow veterans look forward, too.\n\n\"A lot of people when they separate from the military have a hard time moving past their past. He definitely honored his military service but he was focused on his current service to his current community,\" she said. \"Instead of going into the darkness, he became a light for others to follow.\"\n\nManrique was not the only friend that Bergeron lost at Borderline. She was also friends with Justin Meek, another of the victims.\n\n\"Every story I hear from every person about that night, it lights my heart,\" she said. \"They were heroes. They were heroes before Borderline and they still are. They lived up to who they are until the end.\"\n\nJustin Meek\n\nMeek, 23, never stayed idle. At Coronado High School, he was an Eagle Scout, president of the Octagon Club and captain of the JV water polo team, according to his LinkedIn page.\n\nWhile attending California Lutheran University, Meek studied criminal justice and kept up his water polo skills, while also taking part in choir and serving as president of Club Italia. On the rare free time he had, he worked as a lifeguard for the city of Coronado.\n\nWhen the shooting started Wednesday night, Meek was working as a security guard at the Borderline Bar and Grill. He died trying to save others, according to California Lutheran and several social media postings.\n\nMeek received his bachelor\u2019s degree earlier this year from California Lutheran University and graduated at the same time as his mother, Laura Lynn Meek, who survives him.\n\nMeek was \"a big, huge beast of a man, a big tall man. He was a security guard, but he was also a pussycat, one of the sweetest guys in the world,\" Tony Duran told USA TODAY. Duran is owner of Goode Time Productions, which supplies carolers such as Meek to Disneyland and other Disney venues.\n\nA classically trained singer with a deep, rich voice, Meek quickly memorized all 100 songs in the repertoire and dreamed of singing with his girlfriend at Disneyland's Club 33.\n\nThe two had been talking of getting married and their future together as singers, Duran said.\n\n\"It was his dream to sing at Club 33 at Disneyland, and that's never going to happen. It was her dream to sing with him at Club 33, and that's never going to happen \u2013 all because of the stupid choice that killer made that robbed so many people of hearing Justin Meek's beautiful voice. It's senseless.\n\n\"He was loved by so many people,\" Duran said. \"He was just the sweetest guy you'll ever meet. He was the guy you really wanted to have as a friend because of the joy he brought.\"\n\nMeek used his body to shield patrons, Duran said. \"He died a hero. It's going to be hard to not have him with us.\"\n\nAlaina Housley\n\nIn the early morning darkness, friends and family rushed to the scene, desperately looking for their loved ones. They repeatedly called cell phones, scanned social media sites or urged law enforcement for answers.\n\nAlaina Housley, a freshman at Pepperdine University, had gone to the Borderline to line dance with friends. As word of the shooting spread, her aunt, \"The Real\" host and \"Sister, Sister\" star Tamera Mowry-Housley, scoured social media, frantically looking for her niece. Mowry-Housley's husband, Adam Housley, asked his nearly 100,000 Twitter followers for prayers, as they held out hope she was OK.\n\nBy late Thursday morning, however, the couple learned Alaina Housley, 18, didn't make it out of the bar alive.\n\n\"Our hearts are broken,\" they said in a statement. \"Alaina was an incredible young woman with so much life ahead of her, and we are devastated that her life was cut short in this manner.\"\n\nAt Vintage High School, Housley was an honors student who played on the varsity soccer team and served in student government all four years before graduating in June.\n\nCLOSE Ventura County has set up a Family Assistance and Unification Center where shooting victims and their families can seek help after the mass shooting at Borderline Bar and Grill, Wednesday night. (Nov. 8) AP\n\nVintage High principal Sarah O'Connor remembered her as a \"natural leader and connector,\" who was loved by her peers and the school staff. The school is offering counseling support to students and staff.\n\n\"One of my favorite moments was when Alaina, who played violin in our orchestra, had all of the violinists play happy birthday for her mom one year. Her mom is an employee here,\" O'Connor told USA TODAY. \"She did something special for her mom, and she used her musical talent.\n\n\"She was sweet and kind, a good to the core person with great values,\" O'Connor said.\n\nMarcia Battat, Housley's piano teacher from the ages of 5 to 12, said she was thrilled when Housley said she would continue with music in college.\n\nShe recalled how the young girl would show up for lessons with a smile on her face \u2013and a drawing or a poem for Battat in her hand. Housley was musically gifted and had a soft spot for playing songs from Broadway musicals, Battat said.\n\n\"She was very creative and artistic. ... She used to say how she loved piano and she loved me. It was a wonderful experience for me to be able to teach her,\" she said.\n\nOn Thursday, Battat prayed Housley was not among the victims. \"All of the memories I have of her keep going through my mind. It's heartbreaking. I'm still in shock,\" she said.\n\nCody Gifford-Coffman\n\nJason Coffman also rushed to the scene early Thursday hoping to find his first-born son, Cody.\n\n\"I cannot believe it's happened in my family,\" Jason Coffman, 41, told reporters shortly after learning Cody had not survived the shooting massacre. \"I am speechless and heartbroken. ... My life has changed now forever.\"\n\nCLOSE The father of Cody Coffman gave an emotional interview after learning his son was one of the 12 victims of the Thousand Oaks shooting in California. USA TODAY\n\nHe will miss the fishing trips with Cody, he said. He'll miss his companionship on the baseball diamond and the way his younger sons, ages 8 and 9, looked up to Cody, who was 22. Cody was due to become an older brother again: Jason Coffman and his wife are also expecting a baby girl.\n\nTearful and exhausted, Coffman leaned on his father-in-law, identified as Mike, standing next to him. He said he feared Cody ran toward the gunfire, not away from it. \"Cody is a tough kid,\" Jason Coffman told Headline News. \"He\u2019s one of the kids to run toward a bully, to stand up for others. I think that\u2019s maybe what he did.\"\n\nGood with kids, Cody was the head umpire for the Camarillo Pony Baseball League and had planned to join the U.S. Army, Coffman said.\n\n\"There are so many people he touched,\" he said, \"who are now going to be as heartbroken as I am.\"\n\nNoel Sparks\n\nNoel Sparks, a 21-year-old college student, loved going to the Borderline Bar and Grill, so friends and family were not surprised when she posted a photo of herself dancing there Wednesday night.\n\nSparks was a regular at Borderline, where she spent Halloween and celebrated her 21st birthday in August. She often went there with friends and her mom.\n\nShe was majoring in art at nearby Moorpark College. \"Noel taught me more than I could ever teach her \u2013 she had a gentle spirit and always engaged her classmates,\" Moorpark College professor Wendi Baity said in a statement. \"Noel\u2019s honesty and openness touched us all.\"\n\nSparks worked part time at Calvary Community Church in Westlake Village. She helped with children's programs, the Rev. Shawn Thornton told The Associated Press.\n\n\"She loved kids. We had a lot of parents show up today to say, 'She made my child feel important and that they mattered,\" Thornton said.\n\nHer aunt Patricia Sparks of Morristown, Tennessee, said police informed Sparks' father Thursday that she had died in the shooting.\n\n\"We're in shock,\" Patricia Sparks told the AP.\n\nShe described her niece as an \"all-around good girl. She was the kind of girl that if you had friends, you'd want them to marry her.\"\n\nKristina Morisette\n\nKristina Morisette, 20, worked as a cashier at Borderline where, as one friend put it on Facebook, her smile \"welcomed me at the door each night.\"\n\nFriend Devin Cook wrote on her Facebook page: \"You were just the sweetest girl I\u2019ve ever met... you are the last person that deserved such a sudden fate. RIP beauty. Thank you for always putting a smile on my face.\"\n\nThe Simi Valley High School graduate's favorite quote, according to her Facebook page: \"Don't over think it just let it go.\"\n\nMorisette's world revolved around her friends, her parents Michael and Martha told the Los Angeles Times. With money she saved from working at Borderline, she had recently bought her first car: a 2017 Jeep Renegade. She had recently told her parents she wanted to apply for an animal training program in Austin.\n\n\"We didn\u2019t want her life to end,\" her mother told the newspaper. \"But we don\u2019t want her memories now to end, either.\"\n\nSean Adler\n\nSean Adler, 48, a father of two, worked as a bouncer at Borderline and at nearby Azar\u2019s Sports Bar and a strength and conditioning coach at Royal High School. In August, he realized a dream and opened a coffee shop, Rivalry Roasters, in a Simi Valley strip mall.\n\nIn an interview with The Star in October, Adler described the business as a \u201creally micro-roastery\u201d for organic, fair-trade beans sourced from Brazil, Guatemala and Papua New Guinea. He served coffee in a variety of forms \u2014 from pour-overs to cappuccinos \u2014 along with a different flavor of iced tea on nitro each day. In keeping with his interest in sustainable practices, Adler donated the coffee grounds to the Simi Valley Community Garden for use as compost.\n\nHis sister, Valerie Adler, told NBC News that as the gunman opened fire, Adler tried to disarm him.\n\n\"It\u2019s absolutely the kind of thing he would do,\" Danny Evans, a childhood friend, told the Orange County Register. \"He just loved people.\"\n\nJacob Dunham\n\nDunham, 21, was at Borderline that night with his friend Blake Dingman, who also died. Both of them were off-road enthusiasts.\n\nNo Sways Offroad organized a memorial off-road meet for Monday to honor \"our fallen brothers Blake and Jake.\" \"I know we're all heartbroken so let's send them off in a way they'd want,\" the organizers wrote on Instagram.\n\nA recent graduate of Conejo Valley High School, Dunham persevered in receiving his diploma despite an accident as a young child that robbed him of his sight in one eye, said Jason Rosebaugh, one of his teachers.\n\n\"Jacob was well liked by his peers and will be remembered for his perseverance,\" Rosebaugh said.\n\nDunham was not particularly fond of school, but loved his truck, which he bought with savings from a part-time job and fixed up with his dad.\n\n\"He was really proud of that truck and wanted to get a diploma and move onto mechanics school,\" Rosebaugh said.\n\nDunham's father, Ken, told NBC News early Thursday that he had tried repeatedly to reach his son after the shootings. \"I keep calling it but there's no answer,\" he said. Ken Dunham declined to speak with USA TODAY.\n\nBlake Dingman\n\nBlake Dingman, 21, was a young man just starting to come into his own, said his mother Lorrie Dingman.\n\nA Newbury Park resident, he had worked in the commercial electrical field since high school and had just been called and offered a new job working for a local company, according to his family.\n\nDingman was someone who had constant grease under his fingernails. He loved working on cars, motorcycles and from a young age loved taking things apart to see how they worked. \u201cHe could fix anything mechanical\u2026 even if he wasn\u2019t exactly sure how\u2026 that didn\u2019t stop him,\u201d his mother said in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nHe had a large group of friends who loved going to the desert and to the mountains to ride motorcycles or ride the trails in his Ford Ranger. He and his friend Jake Dunham, who also was killed at Borderline, were always in the center of the fun.\n\n\u201cBlake had a zest and joy for living life to the fullest. No gathering was complete without Blake\u2026 His laughter and smile were so special and whenever you talked to him, he was genuinely interested in you\u2026 and always, always had a smile on his face,\u201d said his mother.\n\nHe was also very patriotic. He and Dunham and their friends would go on a \u201cFlag Run\u201d every year on the Fourth of July, in which they mounted large American flags on their trucks and would drive for miles from Ventura County through Los Angeles, honoring the flag and all it represents, his family said.\n\nHis mom said he was always her helper as the family prepared to go boating or on a camping trip. \u201cHe was the one who made sure everything was in order, fixed and ready to go. I\u2019m going to miss his hugs and his heart. He gave the best hugs and always told me he loved me. I am in utter disbelief that I will not be able to hold or hug my son again,\u201d she said.\n\nMark Meza\n\nMark \"Marky\" Meza, who grew up in Santa Barbara and Carpinteria and and graduated from Carpinteria High School, worked at Borderline as a busboy and food runner and was just shy of his 21st birthday, his family told a Santa Barbara television station.\n\n\"Marky was a loving and wonderful young man who was full of life and ambition,\" Meza\u2019s family said in a statement to KEYT. \"His family is devastated by his loss. Marky would have turned 21 on November 19. His family asks for peace and respect at this time to allow them to grieve privately.\"\n\nOn Facebook, his mother simply wrote: \"My heart has never been so broken.\"\n\nRon Helus\n\nSheriff Sgt. Ron Helus was among the first to arrive on the scene, entering the bar with a California Highway Patrol officer. Helus exchanged gunfire with the suspect, identified by authorities as Ian David Long, before being shot multiple times. Helus died at the hospital Thursday morning.\n\nHelus, a 29-year veteran of the department, was looking to retire \"in the next year or so,\" Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said.\n\n\"Ron was a hard-working, dedicated sheriff\u2019s sergeant,\" said Dean, trying to hold back tears. \"He was totally committed. He gave his all. Tonight, as I told his wife, he died a hero because he went in to save lives, to save other people.\"\n\nDuring an interview with CNN, Sgt. Eric Buschow of the Ventura County Sheriff's Office said Helus was a \"true cop's cop,\" enthusiastic and excited about his work in law enforcement.\n\n\"He loved spending time with his son,\" said Buschow. \"They would go fishing up in the Sierras together. My heart goes out to his family. I just can\u2019t imagine what they\u2019re going through right now.\"\n\nSteve Mayorga worked on and off with Helus in the Ventura County Sheriff's Office for almost 30 years. He heard of Helus's death when scrolling through Facebook and seeing multiple posts of a Ventura County Sheriff's badge with a black band over it, the sign of a fallen officer. When Mayorga heard it was Helus who died, and that it happened when Helus rushed inside to try to save someone, he was devastated but not surprised.\n\n\"That's who Ron was,\" said Mayorga, who retired two years ago. \"He was very dedicated to his job. When people call him a 'cop's cop,' what they're saying is that he was the type of cop who other cops looked up to, someone who goes beyond what a normal cop does.\"\n\nHelus, 54, is survived by his wife, Karen, and their 24-year-old son, Jordan.\n\nPrior to heading to the scene, Helus talked to his wife, as he does several times during his shift, Dean said: \"Hey, I gotta go handle a call. I love you. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\"\n\nContributing: USA TODAY's Erin Jensen, Chrissie Thompson, Brett Molina, Lindsay Schnell; Anne Ryman, Arizona Republic; Megan Diskin, Ventura County Star; The Associated Press.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/08/thousand-oaks-shooting-victims/1932896002/", "CLOSE Dwyane Wade announced in a video he posted online that he plans to rejoin the Heat for one final season before retiring at the campaign's conclusion.

That\u2019s why this idea for Thanksgiving place cards is so heartwarming.\n\nAlabama-based designer and marketing executive Jenny Dean Hester says she sent invitations to everyone invited to Thanksgiving dinner, along with the guest list.

The Borderline Bar and Grill is only five miles south of their weekday headquarters in this placid suburban city.\n\nThe Rams all reacted with horror and sadness Thursday after a late-night mass shooting occurred about five miles north of their fields and training rooms.\n\n\"It's gut-wrenching, and it's emotional,\" said Whitworth, who lives in Thousand Oaks with his wife and four children. \"I was up at 3:30, 4 o'clock reading about it, and ended up waking up my wife and talking about it. It's a hard reality. ... The truth is that tragedy is everywhere, and you can't escape tragedy. All you can prepare is how you'll handle it and how you can approach adversity.\"\n\nMarine combat veteran Ian David Long opened fire Wednesday night at the country music bar a 10-minute drive from the Rams' complex. He killed 12 people before apparently killing himself.\n\nThe Rams believe no one connected to their organization was at the bar, but coach Sean McVay and defensive coordinator Wade Phillips both described a somber mood in the Rams' locker room before practice. Whitworth addressed the players and began the process of coming up with a way to honor the victims.\n\nThe team will hold a moment of silence before its home game against Seattle on Sunday, and the Rams may organize additional tributes to the victims, McVay said.\n\n\"It was very heartfelt throughout the entire team,\" offensive guard Rodger Saffold said. \"We work here, and we spend most of our time out here. When we heard about it, it was very shocking. ... It just hurt a lot. There's way too many mass shootings, and this one hit really close to home.\"\n\nPhillips described the shooting as a \"horrible tragedy.\"\n\n\"It's a sad, sad deal, and we feel for the people it happened to,\" Phillips added. \"But it doesn't just affect those people. It affects everybody, and our players are genuinely and greatly concerned about it, as we all are.\"\n\nThe Rams built their training complex 2 1/2 years ago on a corner of the campus of Cal Lutheran University, which had students at the bar during the shooting. Recent graduate Justin Meek was killed, according to the school.\n\nClasses were canceled at CLU on Thursday.\n\nQuarterback Jared Goff , punter Johnny Hekker , receiver Cooper Kupp and others tweeted about the tragedy before practice. After McVay and Whitworth spoke to the team, Saffold said the players discussed putting together a relief fund or other mechanisms of help for the victims.\n\n\"It's something that makes you step back and gives you a perspective,\" McVay said. \"I know me personally, I'm very guilty of losing perspective, because you're just in your own little world and it's all football, all the time, and then you have things like this that occur and re-gather your priorities and your perspective on what's really important, and (serve as a reminder to) not to get bent out of shape on some of the things that maybe I tend to do, just being in the role that I'm in.\"\n\nAlthough the Rams are playing their games downtown in the Coliseum before their new stadium opens in Inglewood in 2020, the team chose the western Los Angeles suburbs for its semi-permanent weekday home when it returned to Southern California from St. Louis in 2016.\n\nThe Rams' separate corporate offices also are in nearby Agoura Hills, a short drive from Thousand Oaks. Most of the team's employees also live in the suburban Ventura County suburbs one hour northwest of downtown Los Angeles.\n\n\"To wake up to something like that, it was just sad to hear it,\" cornerback Marcus Peters said. \"We talked about it as a team, because it's right down the street from us. Stuff like that can affect us. You never know. The first thing, you've got to make sure your teammates (aren't) hurt, anybody else on staff or part of the organization. When things like that happen, you've got to rely on each other. It's going to make us come together eventually.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.apnews.com/NFL and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Photo: Shanna Lockwood, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nCARLSBAD, Calif. -- Major League Baseball owners will vote next week on whether to give commissioner Rob Manfred a five-year contract extension when they meet in Atlanta, three baseball executives told USA TODAY Sports at the GM meetings.\n\nManfred, who was elected commissioner in 2014, is expected to receive unanimous approval. He needs support from 16 of the 30 ownership groups to receive a contract through 2024.\n\nThe executives spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly because of the sensitivity of the vote.\n\nManfred and the owners also are expected to discuss new rules and proposals that arose at the annual GM Meetings, including a 20-second pitch clock for 2019, along with ideas to limit shifts, diminish the use of \u201copeners\u2019\u2019 instead of starting pitchers, and decrease the frequency of pitching changes.\n\nMORE MLB\n\nSeveral GMs proposed the idea of having a 28-man roster in the month of April and limiting the number of players who would be eligible to be on the active rosters in games in September. Yet, deputy commissioner Dan Halem said the concept of increasing the roster before September is likely an issue for the next collective bargaining agreement, which expires in 2021.\n\n\u201cIn the collective bargaining in 2016, it was a topic that was heavily discussed,\u2019\u2019 Halem said. \u201cWe came very close to an agreement on that topic. For a variety of reasons, we didn\u2019t make an agreement on expanding the 25-man roster. I\u2019m sure there will be discussions certainly in the next collective bargaining round. Maybe there will be discussions before, but it\u2019s a topic that we\u2019ll continue to discuss in the future.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe competition committee will discuss potential rule changes in 2019, which will then be addressed with the owners and the MLB Players Association.\n\n\u201cWe discussed everything, and all issues are on the table,\u2019\u2019 Halem said. \u201cPace of play. Potential on-field rule changes. \u2026 But at this point, nothing has been decided. There will no announcements on this for a while. We\u2019re in the beginning of the process.\u2019\u2019\n\nHalem and the GMs also talked about threat of electronic espionage among clubs illegally stealing signs, and there could be limitations to the use of the center-field camera at ballparks and the monitoring of video rooms.\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time on it, and got good suggestions,\u2019\u2019 Halem said. \u201cI think the real issue is giving clubs comfort that other clubs are not using electronic technology to steal signs. We took a variety of measures in the postseason to give clubs comfort that the rules are being enforced. We got some additional suggestions on things we can do. I\u2019ll talk to the commissioner who will make the decision whether we should continue protocols we put in place during the postseason, or whether we should add anything.\"\n\nHalem rejected veteran agent Scott Boras\u2019 belief that attendance plummeted by 4.2% last season because too many teams were deliberately trying to lose to gain a top draft pick instead of being competitive.\n\n\u201cIn our current system we have a cancer that allows losing,\u2019\u2019 Boras said, \u201cand an intent to lose and a non-competitiveness to be rewarded in the development environment.\u2019\u2019\n\nHalem\u2019s response:\n\nTeams rebuild every year, \u201csome of those teams that were 'rebuilding\u2019 did pretty well last year. I don\u2019t, and our owners don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any connection between the rebuilding process and overall attendance.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe biggest reason for the attendance decline, Halem said, was the weather. There were 54 postponements last season, the most since 1997, and 98 of the 351 games in outdoor stadiums in April were played with temperatures under 50 degrees, according to numbertamer.com. Still, this was the lowest baseball\u2019s lowest attendance (69.6 million) since 2003, and the eighth decrease in the last 11 years.\n\nThe time of games were reduced by nearly five minutes last season, but MLB remains concerned about the lack of action during games, with more strikeouts than hits for the first time in history, and a .248 batting average that was the lowest since 1972.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to see more balls in play,\u2019\u2019 Halem said, \u201cthat\u2019s an issue under discussion. It\u2019s an area that were focused on. We\u2019re working very hard to reduce as much dead time in the game as possible so our games are played as crisply as possible.\u2019\u2019\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @BNightengale", "Ryan Fitzpatrick spent the first few weeks of the NFL season looking like an MVP candidate before regressing to the norm and temporarily losing the Buccaneers starting job to Jameis Winston.\n\nThe Bucs have since gone back to Fitzpatrick, and he\u2019s fully embracing the FitzMagic lifestyle.\n\nHe rocked sunglasses at practice while wearing a football helmet.

Rick Scott, left, is hoping to unseat Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla. in November (Photo: Wilfredo Lee (AP)/John McCall/South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Democrats have an \"army of lawyers\" working on the likely recount that will decide the winner of the Florida Senate race, the head of the Democratic National Committee said Thursday.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican, responded that the other party isn't playing fair.\n\n\"Now democrat lawyers are descending on #Florida,\" Rubio tweeted Thursday. \"They have been very clear they aren\u2019t here to make sure every vote is counted. They are here to change the results of election.\"\n\nFewer than 17,400 votes out of more than 8.1 million cast separated Republican challenger Gov. Rick Scott over Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson as of Thursday afternoon. That's inside the 0.25 point margin that dictates a hand recount of ballots that showed either no vote or more than one vote cast in the Senate race.\n\nBut the totals could change before noon Saturday when counties submit preliminary unofficial results to the state.\n\n\"It's a jump ball,\" said Marc Elias, the lawyer overseeing the recount effort for Nelson.\n\nRecounts are also possible in the Florida races for governor and agriculture commissioner.\n\nElias, who has been called by The Washington Post a \"go-to lawyer for Democrats in recount fights and redistricting battles,\" represents the national Democratic Party organizations.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez was asked by reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast what help the party is giving to Nelson.\n\n\"There's an army of lawyers down there now that are working on the recount,\" Perez responded. \"And and I'm glad they're doing that.\"\n\nHe also said the party has \"people on our voter protection team right now chasing provisional ballots\" and \"whatever help anyone needs\" in both Florida and Georgia where Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has not conceded to Republican Brian Kemp.\n\n\"Voter suppression is a permanent staple in their playbook,\" Perez said of Republicans, \"and that's a lesson that we have to learn.\"\n\nFor his part, Rubio pointed the finger at election officials in heavily Democratic Broward County. He accused them of not following the legal requirements on timely reporting of results.\n\n\"It has opened the door for lawyers to come here & try to steal a seat in the U.S. Senate & Florida Cabinet,\" Rubio tweeted of Nelson's seat and the race for state agriculture commissioner.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about how the organization is involved in Florida's Senate contest.\n\nRon Klain, the lawyer who headed Al Gore's recount team in the 2000 presidential race, said Nelson has two main advantages that Gore lacked.\n\nAfter that contentious battle, Florida allowed voters to cast a provisional ballot if their eligibility is in dispute at a polling place. While the number of provisional ballots outstanding in Florida is unknown, if the total ends up being similar to the 25,000 cast in 2016, that's a \"huge potential gain\" for Nelson, Klain said.\n\nNelson also doesn't face an expiring clock as Gore did. The recount in the presidential race was stopped by the Supreme Court because of the December 12 deadline for electoral college votes to be submitted. There's no similar time limit for a congressional recount, Klain notes.\n\nIn fact, the 2008 battle over Minnesota Sen.

(Photo: Jim Dedmon, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series playoffs received a huge jolt when officials announced massive penalties to driver Kevin Harvick and his No. 4 Stewart-Haas Racing team.\n\nHarvick had dominated the playoff race at Texas Motor Speedway on Sunday, and his victory served as guaranteed admission to be among the final four drivers who will contest the championship Nov. 18 at Homestead-Miami Speedway.\n\nAnd then it didn\u2019t.\n\nNASCAR swept that guarantee away after a thorough inspection of Harvick\u2019s Ford at its Research and Development Center, standard for the winning car after every race, revealed that a part of his car was reconfigured to give him an advantage at Texas. Inspectors at the R&D Center found an illegal spoiler that they believe produced an aerodynamic advantage for Harvick when he drove through the turns at Texas.\n\nThe penalties issued Wednesday were costly and drastically altered the state of play in the Round of 8, not just for Harvick but the six other drivers who are hoping to land a berth in the championship round. Joey Logano clinched his spot with a victory at Martinsville Speedway in the first race of the third round two weeks ago.\n\nAlthough Harvick technically gets to keep his win at Texas, he was stripped of the ability to use it to lock himself into the championship race. And while that was the biggest and most obvious setback, NASCAR tacked on additional penalties to the No. 4 team. Harvick was docked 40 points, which dropped him from the top of the playoff standings to fourth, just three points above the cutline.\n\nHe will also lose the expertise of the two most important members of his No. 4. team as NASCAR suspended crew chief Rodney Childers and car chief Robert Smith for two races \u2014 Sunday\u2019s Can-Am 500 at ISM Raceway near Phoenix (2:30 p.m. ET, NBC) and the championship race at Homestead. Childers was also fined $75,000.\n\nAll of that could spell disaster for Harvick\u2019s bid to add a second championship to the one he claimed in 2014. Yet for fans of the No. 4 team, there is a small silver lining: the location of Sunday\u2019s race.\n\nIf there is one track on the Cup schedule where Harvick should feel confident about overcoming adversity, it\u2019s ISM Raceway. No driver, active or retired, has had more success in Phoenix than Harvick.\n\nThe Bakersfield, California, native has nine Cup wins at the 1-mile track, including seven in his last 12 races. He has produced top-five finishes in 15 of 31 Cup races in Phoenix, and his average finish is 9.5, tied with Dale Earnhardt Sr. for best among all drivers with at least six starts. And no one has led more laps in the desert. Harvick\u2019s 1,522 laps led dwarfs his next closest competitor, Jimmie Johnson with 990.\n\nSo Harvick knows how to win in Phoenix. He celebrated in victory lane this spring, but more important, he took the checkered flag in the 2014 playoff race.\n\nHeading into that contest, Harvick was last among the eight remaining playoff drivers in the standings after a disastrous third-round opener at Martinsville, and while he salvaged quite a few points with a runner-up finish in Texas, he came to Phoenix in a must-win situation. Harvick not only won that race, he dominated, leading 264 of 312 laps. That victory propelled him to Homestead, where he won again to clinch his first championship.\n\nThe six other playoff drivers battling for a spot in the final four know Harvick will be a factor on Sunday with or without his crew chief and car chief. They might even be more worried, knowing that Harvick will be more laser focused on winning now that he no longer has a guaranteed spot in the championship race.\n\nFor Kyle Busch, Martin Truex Jr., Chase Elliott and Harvick\u2019s Stewart-Haas Racing teammates Kurt Busch, Aric Almirola and Clint Bowyer, an extra path has opened to Homestead. Three Championship 4 berths will be on the line at Phoenix instead of two. But they will still have to catch Harvick on the track.", "No. 2 Clemson (9-0, 6-0 ACC, No. 2 CFP) at No. 17 Boston College (7-2, 4-1, No. 17 CFP), 8 p.m. EST (ABC)\n\nLine: Clemson by 19\u00bd.\n\nSeries record: Clemson leads 16-9-2.\n\nWHAT'S AT STAKE?\n\nClemson can clinch the ACC Atlantic title and its fourth straight trip to the conference championship game.

The Broncos hit their bye week with a 3-6 record, in danger of posting back-to-back losing seasons for the first time since 1971-72. (AP Photo/Jack Dempsey, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 Vance Joseph keeps losing games but not his locker room.\n\nThat's why Denver Broncos general manager John Elway didn't fire his coach at the bye like so many fans were suggesting.\n\nDespite Joseph's 8-17 mark in Denver and a 3-6 start for the second straight season, Elway is encouraged by the growth he sees in the coach he contemplated firing last year and in the fight he sees in his scrappy team this year.\n\n\"At this point in time, we're going to stay the course. I think there's enough good things that are going on ... and the way that we're playing,\" Elway told Broncos broadcasting partner 760-AM in Denver. \"I'm much more encouraged this year than I was last year.\"\n\nIn 2017, the Broncos lost eight games by double digits on their way to a 5-11 mark.\n\nAlthough they're flirting with back-to-back losing seasons for the first time in 46 years, the Broncos have gone toe to toe with some of the league's heavyweights.\n\nThey've lost by a combined dozen points to the Chiefs (8-1) twice, the Rams (8-1) and the Texans (6-3).\n\nElway hit the motherlode in 2018 by drafting Bradley Chubb, Courtland Sutton, Royce Freeman and Josey Jewell and signing undrafted free agent Phillip Lindsay.\n\nThese baffling Broncos, though, lack depth at key positions because of his deficient drafts in recent years that include first-rounders Bradley Roby, Shane Ray, Paxton Lynch and Garett Bolles.\n\nWith the immediate impact of so many rookies and the strong, steady play of veterans Von Miller , Chris Harris Jr. , and Emmanuel Sanders , the Broncos have enough star power to compete with the league's top teams.\n\nThey also have a razor-thin margin for error as they're repeatedly encumbered by bad play-calling, penalties and poor performances, especially by Bolles at left tackle and Roby at cornerback.\n\nBolles' NFL-high 17 holding calls in his 1\u00bd seasons has earned him the nickname \"Garett Holds\" on Denver's airwaves.\n\nAfter excelling as a nickel back for years, Roby's promotion to starter in a contract year following Aqib Talib's trade to the Rams has been a perplexing failure.\n\nYet, Joseph has had to let both Bolles and Roby fix their flaws in the glare of games because of a lack of depth at their positions. Last month, Joseph told The Associated Press he didn't fear losing his players over sticking with Bolles and Roby: \"They understand we're playing the best players.\"\n\nDespite their holes, the Broncos could be 6-3 and surrounded by an entirely different narrative were it not for three slip-ups, all at home:\n\n\u2014They lost 27-23 to the Chiefs when offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave inexplicably went to three-wide sets on a crucial fourth-quarter three-and-out, giving the ball back right away to Patrick Mahomes for what turned into the game-winning drive. With Denver's defense exhausted \u2014 Harris was taken off for IVs \u2014 what was needed instead was for the Broncos to run both the football and time off the clock.\n\n\u2014They lost 23-20 to the Rams when Sanders' taunting foul resulted in a field goal instead of a touchdown, a four-point swing that proved to be the difference.\n\n\u2014They lost 19-17 to the Texans when Brandon McManus missed a 51-yard field goal as time expired after Joseph decided he was close enough after reaching the Houston 32 with 38 seconds left. The Broncos ran down the clock to 13 seconds before snapping it again and Lindsay lost a yard.\n\nMcManus, who missed a 62-yarder in the closing seconds of the first half, allowing the Texans to go down and kick a field goal for a six-point swing, had never missed consecutive kicks as a pro but was again wide right.\n\nJoseph accepted the blame for the 62-yarder, saying he got greedy because of Denver's offensive struggles.\n\n\"Put that on me,\" Joseph said. \"I was chasing points. That's wrong.\"\n\nJoseph, however, staunchly defended his decision-making on the second one when he decided not to risk Case Keenum getting sacked again after the Broncos got inside the Houston 35-yard line.\n\nHowever, McManus is much more accurate from inside of 50 yards than outside. He's successful 77 percent of the time between 40 and 49 yards, but just 52 percent of the time on field goals of 50 yards and longer.\n\nSo, Joseph basically settled for a coin flip and paid the price with his 17th loss in 25 games as Broncos coach, leading furious fans to call for his ouster as they filed out of Mile High Stadium on Sunday night.\n\nNot so fast, said Elway.\n\n\"You'd love to have the magic wand and throw the fairy dust on this thing and have some good things happen and get us over the hump,\" Elway said on 760-AM. \"We've been in six one-score games, so I'm much more encouraged this year than I was last year because I think that guys are still playing hard and we're in games.\"\n\nAlthough the Broncos have the 49ers, Browns and Raiders left to play, they also face the Chargers (6-2) twice, the Steelers (5-2-1) and the Bengals (5-3).\n\nJoseph said the Broncos need to start and finish better and somehow \"find six more points a game.\"\n\n\"We do that,\" Joseph said, \"we can win a lot of games.\"\n\nAnd maybe save his job again come January.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They'll try to avoid getting bounced from the rankings and hang on to hope of playing on New Year's day with a strong finish. The Badgers still have a shot at winning the West Division, a game behind Northwestern with three weeks to play.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nPenn State's front seven vs. Wisconsin's running game. Wisconsin RB Jonathan Taylor is averaging 151 yards per game with 11 touchdowns. He's been especially strong coming out after halftime where he's averaging 6.4 yards per carry in the third quarter. Minimizing Taylor's impact has to be a priority for a defense that's on pace to defend 961 plays after being on the field for 898 all of last season.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nWisconsin: QB Jack Coan could make his second career start if Alex Hornibrook, who suffered a concussion last week against Rutgers, is ruled out. Coan has been solid with a 66 percent completion rate, 222 yards and a pair of touchdowns in two games. His other start also came on the road, came two weeks ago at Northwestern.\n\nPenn State: RB Miles Sanders. Penn State's offense has been stagnant lately and Sanders could provide a boost, especially if QB Trace McSorley still struggles with his knee injury. Sanders hasn't been as involved since he caught six passes in a 21-touch effort on Oct. 20.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nPenn State has won three straight in the series including a 38-31 in the 2016 Big Ten title game. . Penn State was held to seven points at Michigan last week, the first time the Nittany Lions were held to single digits since Sept. 27, 2014. ... McSorley (13.47) and Hornibrook (13.43) are No. 1 and 2 in the Big Ten, respectively, in yards per completion. .

(AP) \u2014 Evan Engram understands that he has all the tools to be a top tight end in the NFL.\n\nThe New York Giants' second-year player, the team's first-round selection in 2017, has the size, speed and the drive to be a star.\n\nThere's only one problem. Engram has a propensity of dropping passes, especially in clutch situations.\n\nEngram caught 64 passes for 722 yards and six touchdowns last season. Engram also dropped 11 passes and vowed in the offseason to work on rectifying that problem.\n\nNow, in his second season, Engram has caught 17 passes for 145 yards and two touchdowns, but he has also dropped three passes.\n\n\"It's pretty tough,\" Engram said Thursday before the team practiced in preparation for facing the San Francisco 49ers on Monday night.\n\n\"It's not where I want to be. I have to put some of these plays behind me and keep working on getting better and staying positive.\"\n\nEngram's problems are also magnified because the Giants have a 1-7 record for the second straight season.\n\n\"We just have to go out and get a win,\" Engram said. \"We have to get some of the bad tastes out of our mouths. It's going to feel good to get out there on the big stage Monday night.\"\n\nThe Giants are coming off their bye week, which should make the beleaguered team feel a little better.\n\n\"I think it's important to put the bad things behind me,\" Engram said. \"A couple of those drops are catches that I can make in my sleep. I just want to go out there and give us enough an opportunity to win the game Monday night.\"\n\nEngram was the first rookie tight end to lead the Giants in receptions. His six touchdown catches were a franchise record for a rookie tight end in 2017.\n\nSo the potential is there. He just has to make sure to hold on to the ball, something that coach Pat Shurmur also realizes.\n\n\"Evan is a pass-catching tight end,\" Shurmur said. \"I think we all realize that. But it's important that he catches the ball. He's had a couple of drops. But he works at it. He has worked all along at catching the ball. He does a lot of drills, a lot of extra work. He works hard at catching the ball. He always puts the drop behind him and continues to work hard at trying to catch the ball.\"\n\nQuarterback Eli Manning recognizes Engram's passion for improving.\n\n\"Evan works hard and wants to do everything right,\" said Manning, who will remain the team's starter for the time being. \"He puts in a lot of work. He's too good of a player and an athlete to let the little things bother him.\"\n\nManning knows that the Giants have had their difficulties scoring touchdowns this season.\n\n\"I feel like we're moving the ball well,\" Manning said. \"We're getting yards and moving the ball down the field. We just need that to translate into scoring touchdowns. It always comes down to execution. We have to avoid the negative plays. We just have to execute better in the red zone.\"\n\nManning did not want to talk about whether Monday night's game against the Niners might be his last as a starter this season.\n\n\"I'm worried about this week,\" he said. \"I have a job to do right now. We're just going to try to go out there and get the win this time. Sure, there's a sense of urgency. We all need to get going. We need to improve. We need to score some points. I feel like we're close. We just have to get back on track, keep improving and play some football.\"\n\nThe improvement might have to begin with the second-year tight end.\n\n\"I watch film of other tight ends,\" Engram said. \"There are a lot of athletic tight ends in the league, so I try to pick up plays that can make me more effective. I love watching (Kansas City TE) Travis Kelce. He's so polished and smooth as a tight end. It's fun watching him. I always try to steal things from him.\"\n\nSo Engram took the practice field Thursday with the idea that the dropped passes, 14 over his first 1\u00bd seasons, are a thing of the past.\n\n\"I think we all strive for perfection,\" Engram said. \"I just have to put it (the dropped passes) behind me. I understand that it's part of the game and it's something that makes you work harder.\"\n\nNOTES: Shurmur continued to hint that newly acquired OG Jamon Brown might start Monday night, just a week after being claimed on waivers from the Los Angeles Rams. \"We're putting him in there and getting him ready like he's going to start,\" Shurmur said of Brown. \"He's a big man, a really big man (6-foot-4 and 340 pounds). He was a starter on a team that won more than 10 games last year. He's a really fast learner.\" ... Standout safety Landon Collins did not want to comment on a report that said the Giants were either going to place the franchise tag on him for next season or work on a long-term contract. \"There has been no talk about that,\" Collins said. \"When we get to that, we get to that. If something happens, I'll let you know.\" ... Manning said that he spoke with QB Kyle Lauletta about his arrest last week for motor vehicle violations in Weehawken, N.J. \"It's a tough situation for him,\" Manning said. \"I'm trying to support him. This whole thing will be forgotten about and will be water under the bridge very shortly.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Two struggling AFC East rivals with uncertain quarterback situations square off when the Bills and New York Jets meet on Sunday. (AP Photo/Adrian Kraus, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 Even the most die-hard of Bills and Jets fans might have a tough time getting fired up about this one.\n\nStruggling offenses, quarterback questions and losing streaks are the ugly story lines marking the latest matchup of AFC East rivals, the first of their two meetings this season.\n\n\"It's the NFL and anybody can be beat in this league,\" Jets safety Jamal Adams said. \"You've definitely got to show up each and every Sunday. It doesn't matter what the numbers are.\"\n\nWell, they aren't very good \u2014 for either side \u2014 when it comes to offense.\n\nThe Bills (2-7) have the 31st-ranked overall unit and have been dealing with a quarterback carousel all season, and were trying to figure out late in the week where it would stop this time.\n\nRookie Josh Allen has missed three games with a sprained right throwing elbow , veteran Derek Anderson was in concussion protocol, and turnover-prone Nathan Peterman has been healthy but ineffective, to put it mildly. He completed a career-high 31 passes last week against Chicago, but also had three interceptions in the 41-9 rout by the Bears.\n\nIt has been a problem all season no matter who has been under center for the Bills, who have lost four straight. They have scored two touchdowns in their last four games, and been outscored 103-20 in its last three.\n\n\"Well, you know, the result, obviously, is not what we want it to be on the offensive side,\" coach Sean McDermott said. \"We've got to continue to find ways to create things, to create separation, to create wins in the 1-on-1 game, whether it's the run game or the pass game. You always look at yourself first. I expect myself and our coaches to look at ourselves first, and I expect the players to look at themselves first.\n\n\"Collectively, though, we have to do a better job.\"\n\nThe Jets (3-6) know the feeling.\n\nTodd Bowles' bunch has echoed those sentiments during the team's second three-game skid of the season.\n\n\"We're kind of realizing that it's a time to come closer together as a team, as a family and as a brotherhood,\" defensive lineman Leonard Williams said. \"When times are starting to get hard, that's when we've got to face adversity arm in arm and face it as a team.\"\n\nIt appears they'll have to do it without rookie Sam Darnold, who is dealing with a foot strain that could sideline him a few weeks. Darnold leads the league with 14 interceptions, so 39-year-old Josh McCown might be what the Jets need to get things back on track for the league's 29th-ranked offense.\n\n\"I'll go out and expect to play to my standard and to the standard of this football team,\" McCown said, \"and win a football game.\"\n\nHere are other things to know about the Bills-Jets matchup at MetLife Stadium:\n\nTHE REAL McCOY?\n\nBills running back LeSean McCoy is off to the worst start of his career with just 267 yards rushing and has yet to score.\n\nHe had 10 yards on 10 carries against the Bears, and hasn't been anything close to the dynamic player he has been throughout his career. McCoy was mentioned as a possible piece in a trade leading up to last week's deadline, but remains with Buffalo.\n\nOH, SNAP!\n\nThe struggles of Jets center Spencer Long have epitomized the New York's problems on offense.\n\nLong has been trying to play through an injured right middle finger on his snapping hand, and things really came to a head last week when he had several wayward snaps out of the shotgun. Bowles finally pulled him for Jonotthan Harrison late in the game, and Long could find himself on the sideline again this week.\n\nFAMILIAR FACE\n\nThe Bills were so desperate for receiver help they thrust Terrelle Pryor on the field five days after signing him. That came two weeks after the Jets cut him with an injury settlement because of an ailing groin.\n\nNew York thought he'd be sidelined a while, but Pryor was back on the field last Sunday and had two catches for 19 yards. He'll have a chance to show the Jets how healthy he is Sunday.\n\nELI RETURNS\n\nSecond-year running back Elijah McGuire had 30 yards on seven carries and three catches for 37 yards for the Jets in his season debut after spending the first eight games on injured reserve with a broken foot.\n\nMcGuire has stepped into the dual-threat role usually held Bilal Powell, who's out for the season with a neck injury.\n\n\"Really nice,\" offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates said of McGuire's play. \"I was really fired up about him last year. A true pro, reminds me of Kevin Faulk. I thought he played very well.\"\n\nBRIGHT SPOT\n\nBuffalo's defense ranks third overall in the NFL, including third against the pass and 11th against the run.\n\nThe Bills were done in by offensive turnovers last week against the Bears, but they allowed only 190 yards of offense by Chicago. It was the fewest allowed since 103 in a 19-0 win vs. Miami in 2013. It was also the fewest in a Bills loss since a 20-6 defeat at Baltimore in 2004.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer John Wawrow contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

We\u2019ll present the case for and against all of the top candidates\u2026\n\n\u00a9 Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nRivers has plenty to work with in Los Angeles, but it\u2019s hard to imagine this offense being nearly as successful without this quarterback under center. Nobody is better at making pre-snap changes than Rivers, and that makes all of his teammates, including the offensive line, Melvin Gordon and Keenan Allen, better. The stats are there, too: Rivers is averaging 9.1 yards per attempt and ranks third in passer rating. Those numbers would look even better if his receivers had done a better job of catching the ball. He lost at least 150 yards and two touchdowns to drops in the Chiefs game alone. And Rivers isn\u2019t exactly throwing to wide-open receivers like the other QB\u2019s on this list. Per NFL.com\u2019s Next Gen Stats, only six full-time starters have thrown into tight windows more often than Rivers.\n\nNarrative matters in these award races, and Rivers winning MVP wouldn\u2019t make for as interesting a story as Patrick Mahomes or Drew Brees winning it. So if Rivers wants to pull ahead, he\u2019ll have to beat both of those guys out in the statistical department and finish with a better record. That probably won\u2019t happen.\n\n\u00a9 Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMahomes is on pace to throw for 5,175 yards and 52 touchdowns! He\u2019s the most prolific passer in the league and the conductor for best offense. Mahomes also has plenty of \u201cMVP moments\u201d this season, including his left-handed pass in Denver and that crazy touchdown pass against the 49ers. In terms of moments, no quarterback can compare to Mahomes.\n\nWe know what this Chiefs offense looks like without Mahomes behind center \u2026 and it\u2019s not much worse than what we\u2019re seeing this year. Kansas City\u2019s offense was rolling with Alex Smith in 2017 before a late-season dip. These Chiefs are even more loaded than that team with Sammy Watkins and an improved Tyreek Hill. And Andy Reid\u2019s scheme has done a lot of the heavy lifting for this passing game, providing Mahomes with open receivers all season.\n\nIt\u2019s a travesty that Brees has yet to win an MVP award, and that probably should change some time soon. Why not in 2018 when he\u2019s leading the league in passer rating? He\u2019s also the best player on the league\u2019s best team. In terms of efficiency, Brees is having one of the best seasons we\u2019ve ever seen. He\u2019s completing 76% of his passes and averaging 8.4 yards per attempt. He\u2019s had only two games with a passer rating under 114. The MVP award has essentially become \u201cThe QB with the best stats on the best team\u201d award, and it\u2019s hard to argue that Brees hasn\u2019t been that guy in 2018.\n\nWhile Brees has mostly played at a high level all season, he has had two poor performances. One against Giants and another on the road against a good Vikings team. The Saints had no trouble winning either game, taking them by an average margin of 12.5 points. This team has shown it can be quite good even when Brees isn\u2019t at his best. That just goes to show how valuable Sean Payton has been for both this offense and Brees himself.\n\nNo NFL team runs an offense quite like the one the Panthers run, and Newton is at the center of it. If we\u2019re talking about value, is there any team that leans on its quarterback as much as Carolina leans on Newton? The answer is no. If the Panthers replaced Newton, who is on pace for career highs in every statistical category, they\u2019d have to scrap 60% of their playbook. And Newton is putting up these big numbers with a receiving corps led by Devin Funchess. His best target in the passing game is Greg Olsen, who just recently got healthy.\n\nNewton is putting up big numbers, but his numbers do not compare to the quarterbacks ahead of him on this list. Most MVP voters aren\u2019t breaking down film or studying schemes, so Newton\u2019s play will go under-appreciated if he doesn\u2019t have the numbers to match what he means to the Panthers.\n\n\u00a9 Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports\n\nI know running backs don\u2019t matter anymore, but Gurley could break Ladainian Tomlinson\u2019s single-season touchdown record and break 2,000 yards from scrimmage. He is the focal point of Sean McVay\u2019s offense. Some think that Jared Goff, because of the position he plays, is the more valuable player, but if McVay had a choice between keeping either Goff or Gurley, he\u2019d probably go with the latter. Goff is just an above average talent at the quarterback position. Gurley is a generational running back.\n\nThe NFL is a quarterback-driven league, and there are a handful of quarterbacks on a historical pace this season. Gurley may have to do more than just break Tomlinson\u2019s record to garner MVP consideration. He probably has to shatter the record, and that\u2019s just unlikely to happen.\n\n\u00a9 Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Rams have a chance to finish this season with the league\u2019s best record, and Goff has put up big numbers. That has always been the recipe for an MVP season. As long as he stays on this statistical pace, Goff will be in the MVP discussion.\n\nQuestion: How many quarterbacks could replace Goff and produce at the same rate in this Rams offense? I can name at least 10. Goff has made a handful of spectacular throws and has proven himself as a good quarterback, but the most valuable player in the league? He\u2019s not even the most valuable player on his own team.\n\n\u00a9 Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAfter a slow start to the season, Ryan has looked like the quarterback we saw in 2016. In fact, his 2018 numbers don\u2019t look all that different from the numbers he put up during his MVP campaign. The difference is, he hasn\u2019t had a fully healthy offense around him and he no longer has Kyle Shanahan scheming up wide open receivers. Ryan has transcended the system around him and deserves MVP consideration even if the Falcons are struggling to stay in the MVP race.", "Oregon wide receiver Dillon Mitchell (13), escapes a tackle in the fourth quarter and runs in for a touchdown against UCLA during an NCAA college football game in Eugene, Ore., Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018 (AP Photo/Thomas Boyd) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHere are some things to watch in the Pac-12 Conference this week:\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK: Oregon at Utah. This game has lots of drama, with Utah missing quarterback Tyler Huntley, who is out for the regular season with a broken collarbone. The Utes will start redshirt freshman Jason Shelley as the team seeks to remain atop the jumbled Pac-12 South. \"Losing Tyler, he was a heck of a player, so we have to make sure Jason knows we have complete confidence in him and I believe he does,\" coach Kyle Whittingham said. The Ducks, meanwhile, are bowl eligible and on the upswing after snapping a two-game losing streak with a victory over UCLA.\n\nMATCHUP OF THE WEEK: Washington State quarterback Gardner Minshew II against Colorado's defense. The Buffaloes are in the bottom half of the league for pass defense, allowing 237 yards a game, which means Minshew may get a chance to up his Heisman profile with a big day. Minshew has thrown for at least 300 yards in every game this season and leads the nation in completions per game (36.36), passing yards per game (390.8) and total offense per game (397.4). Minshew is a must-watch this season.\n\nNUMBERS GAME: The Pac-12 has four of the top seven running backs at the FBS level: Arizona State's Eno Benjamin (fifth, 123.7 yards per game), Arizona's J.J. Taylor, (sixth, 122.1 yards), Oregon State's Jermar Jefferson (tied for seventh, 121.3 yards), Utah's Jack Moss (tied for seventh, 121.3 yards per game). ... There is the possibility that all of the Pac-12 South's teams could end the season tied for first in the standings. ... In the North, if Washington and Washington State both win out, the division will be decided by the Apple Cup. ... Home teams hold just a 22-16 edge this season in conference play. ... Washington linebacker Ben Burr-Kirven leads the league with 134 tackles this season. He has 10 or more in eight games this season. .. Eno Benjamin tops the league in rushing. His 1,113 total rushing yards are the third-most for the Sun Devils since they joined the conference. He's got 100-plus rushing yards in six games this season.\n\nUPSET WATCH: Not a lot of upset specials in the league this week, but the most intriguing would be a UCLA victory over Arizona State in Tempe on Saturday \u2014 just because it would really stir up more chaos in the South. And it feels like Bruins coach Chip Kelly may be poised to pull off an encouraging win in a disappointing first season. The Sun Devils are 13\u00bd-point favorites.\n\nIMPACT PERFORMER: Oregon safety Ugochukwu Amadi had a 56-yard punt return for a touchdown early in Oregon's victory over UCLA last weekend for the Ducks' first punt return for a score since 2015. Amadi is the only FBS player to score on both a punt return and an interception return this season. He has two pick-sixes this season, and three interceptions overall.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Williams had arthroscopic knee surgery after getting hurt in the team' loss to Tennessee and will miss at least one game. The Cowboys appear set to leave Looney at center for this week's game against the Philadelphia Eagles. He's been there all season in place of four-time Pro Bowler Travis Frederick, out with a nerve disorder. If Looney stays put, left guard will be filled by either Adam Redmond or Xavier Su'a-Filo. (AP Photo/Roger Steinman, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 It didn't take Golden Tate long to learn his new team's biggest rival.\n\nTate, the playmaking wide receiver acquired from Detroit last week, will make his debut with the Philadelphia Eagles (4-4) against the Dallas Cowboys (3-5) on Sunday night.\n\n\"I've read my social media, so our fans have expressed the passionate dislike of the Cowboys,\" Tate said. \"It's going to be a great game. I'm happy that my first game gets to be at home against such an intense opponent.\"\n\nTate had his best game this season against the Cowboys, catching eight passes for 132 yards and two touchdowns on Sept. 30.\n\n\"I think it gives me an advantage,\" Tate said. \"I've seen those guys. They are going to run the same defense, and I'm on another team with a completely different playbook.\"\n\nThe defending Super Bowl champion Eagles are coming off a bye week and trail the Washington Redskins (5-3) in the NFC East. The Cowboys are reeling following a 28-14 loss at home to Tennessee on Monday night.\n\n\"One hundred percent, it's a must win,\" running back Ezekiel Elliott said. \"Being a division game, that makes it that much more important. Must win.\"\n\nHere are some things to know about the Cowboys-Eagles prime-time matchup:\n\nDAK & CARSON\n\nWhen Dak Prescott led the Cowboys to a 13-3 record in 2016 while fellow rookie Carson Wentz was 7-9 with the Eagles, some thought Dallas got the better franchise quarterback \u2014 and in the fourth round. The Eagles traded a slew of draft picks to move up and select Wentz at No. 2 overall.\n\nBut Prescott is 12-12 since with 32 TDs, 18 interceptions and an 87.4 passer rating. There are even questions whether he's going to be the long-term answer in Dallas.\n\nMeanwhile, Wentz is 14-5 with 46 TDs, only nine picks, and a 104.5 rating in the past two seasons, though he missed last year's playoffs after tearing his ACL. He's undoubtedly the present and future in Philadelphia despite having to watch Nick Foles lead the team to its first NFL title since 1960.\n\nO-LINE WOES\n\nThe difficulties continue for Dallas' once-vaunted offensive line, which has surrendered 28 sacks of Prescott, just four shy of his career high halfway through the season. Rookie left guard Connor Williams had arthroscopic knee surgery after getting hurt in the loss to Tennessee and will miss at least one game.\n\nThe Cowboys appear set to leave Joe Looney at center. He's been there all season in place of four-time Pro Bowler Travis Frederick, out with a nerve disorder. If Looney stays put, left guard will be filled by either Adam Redmond or Xavier Su'a-Filo.\n\nDALLAS VS. DALLAS\n\nEagles rookie tight end Dallas Goedert will face the team he was named after for the first time.\n\nPhiladelphia traded up in the second round and moved ahead of the Cowboys to select Goedert, who would've helped replace retired Jason Witten in Dallas. Goedert has 18 receptions for 188 yards and three TDs while teammate Zach Ertz ranks first among tight ends with 61 catches.\n\nGoedert will hear plenty of \"Dallas stinks!\" chants and worse. He knows fans won't be referring to him.\n\nPASS RUSH PUZZLE\n\nThe Cowboys are awaiting the return of defensive end Randy Gregory, who had knee surgery similar to Williams before the bye week and missed the last game. He was listed as limited in practice early in the week. Taco Charlton injured a shoulder against Tennessee and didn't practice to start the week. Defensive tackle David Irving, out the first four games on a substance-abuse suspension, is likely to miss a second straight game with a sprained ankle.\n\nDeMarcus Lawrence, who tied for second with 14\u00bd sacks last season, stopped a three-game sackless streak against the Titans. Daniel Ross and Tyrone Crawford had a sack apiece, while Caraun Reid and rookie Dorance Armstrong shared one.\n\nNEW PUNT RETURNER\n\nThe Eagles released DeAndre Carter, who was returning punts during Darren Sproles' absence. Sproles is expected to play after missing seven games with a hamstring injury. He has seven career TDs on punt returns. Tate also could be used in that role, though he hasn't done it much recently.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Schuyler Dixon contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nNotre Dame tight end Cole Kmet runs after making a catch against Northwestern at Ryan Field. (Photo: Mike Dinovo, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nOf the nine Power Five teams with fewer than two losses, only Alabama finds itself in the enviable position of having ample room for error.\n\nNo one \u2014 not even No. 2 Clemson \u2014 is so lucky. While on solid footing two weeks into November, the Tigers are not a lock for a top-four finish without another ACC championship. Likewise with the third Power Five unbeaten, Notre Dame, which can\u2019t afford to lose one of its final three games of the regular season.\n\nThe final month of the regular season could play out smoothly or, perhaps more likely, resemble a nine-car pileup. Let\u2019s look at the scenarios for each of the Power Five teams with fewer than two losses to either make or miss the top four. (All rankings are per the College Football Playoff\u2019s latest Top 25.)\n\nNo. 1 Alabama (9-0)\n\nRemaining games: vs. No. 16 Mississippi State, vs. The Citadel, vs. No. 24 Auburn, vs. No. 5 Georgia (in SEC championship game).\n\nToughest game: Georgia. The matchup with Mississippi State\u2019s defensive front is interesting and Auburn\u2019s always a frenzied rivalry, but Georgia provides the toughest obstacle to a perfect regular season.\n\nHow Alabama gets in: Winning out is the easiest road, but the Tide can still lose once and crack the top four.\n\nWorst-case scenario: The Tide lose to Auburn on Nov. 24 and then to Georgia a week later. Two losses would eliminate even Alabama.\n\nNo. 2 Clemson (9-0)\n\nRemaining games: at No. 17 Boston College, vs. Duke, vs. South Carolina, vs. winner of ACC Coastal Division\n\nToughest game: Boston College. The Eagles have the star power at certain positions and the secondary, not to mention the home-field advantage, to give Clemson a scare.\n\nHow Clemson gets in: Winning out. Clemson is also in at 12-1 if that one loss comes during the regular season and not in the conference title game.\n\nWorst-case scenario: The Tigers lose once in November \u2014 let\u2019s say to the hated Gamecocks for maximum pain \u2014 and then again in the ACC championship.\n\nNo. 3 Notre Dame (9-0)\n\nRemaining games: vs. Florida State, vs. No. 13 Syracuse (at Yankee Stadium), at Southern California\n\nToughest game: Syracuse. Not to say USC won\u2019t be highly motivated in the finale, but the Orange\u2019s offensive firepower is worrisome.\n\nHow Notre Dame gets in: Again, by winning out. There\u2019s an argument for one-loss Notre Dame, especially if Michigan wins the Big Ten. But that would also require help from at least one other Power Five conference.\n\nWorst-case scenario: The Irish lose to outmanned FSU this weekend and tumble down the polls. Alabama, Clemson, Michigan and Oklahoma win out to claim the top four; Notre Dame is left on the outside looking in.\n\nNo. 4 Michigan (8-1)\n\nRemaining games: at Rutgers, vs. Indiana, at No. 10 Ohio State, vs. winner of Big Ten West Division (if applicable)\n\nToughest game: Ohio State. The rivalry will take on a frenzied pitch with a division title and potential playoff berth on the line.\n\nHow Michigan gets in: Already nestled in the top four, Michigan is very likely in a semifinal at 12-1. There is a potential sticking point, however. What if Georgia beats Alabama but Clemson and Notre Dame remain unbeaten? In that case, Alabama could slide down to No. 4 and knock the Wolverines out of the picture.\n\nWorst-case scenario: Losing to Ohio State. There\u2019d be a New Year\u2019s Six bowl as a bittersweet gift, but it\u2019s not a scenario Michigan wants to consider.\n\nNo. 5 Georgia (8-1)\n\nRemaining games: vs. No. 24 Auburn, vs. Massachusetts, vs. Georgia Tech, vs. No. 1 Alabama (in SEC championship game)\n\nToughest game: Alabama. This one will be the decider for Georgia \u2014 a win means another playoff berth and a loss means a New Year\u2019s Six bowl.\n\nHow Georgia gets in: Georgia doesn\u2019t need to worry about any other team currently in contention. That\u2019s because the Bulldogs are in with a win against Alabama regardless of what happens elsewhere. No matter what, the Bulldogs are in the top three at 12-1 and winners of the SEC.\n\nWorst-case scenario: You could imagine Georgia at three losses heading into the postseason, with a setback to Alabama joined by a disheartening loss to one of Auburn or rival Georgia Tech.\n\nGeorgia running back D'Andre Swift carries the ball against Florida during their game in 2017. (Photo: Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNo. 6 Oklahoma (8-1)\n\nRemaining games: vs. Oklahoma State, vs. Kansas, at No. 9 West Virginia, vs. opponent in Big 12 championship game (if applicable)\n\nToughest game: West Virginia. The two could meet again a week later in the Big 12 title game.\n\nHow Oklahoma gets in: If the top three hold, the Sooners would need to win out and have Michigan lose once. It\u2019s possible that 12-1 and Big Ten champion Ohio State would move ahead of OU, but that\u2019s a significant amount of space for the Buckeyes to make up in four games while the Sooners conceivably add two additional wins against ranked opponents.\n\nWorst-case scenario: Just one loss would knock OU out of the Big 12 title game should Texas run the table. The Longhorns own the head-to-head tiebreaker.\n\nNo. 8 Washington State (8-1)\n\nRemaining games: at Colorado, vs. Arizona, vs. No. 25 Washington, vs. winner of Pac-12 South Division (if applicable)\n\nToughest game: Washington. The Huskies have won five in a row and eight of nine in the series.\n\nHow Washington State gets in: Washington State first needs Alabama to win out, which knocks Georgia from the mix. Now, let\u2019s say Clemson wins the ACC, leaving two open spots. Washington State would then need both the Big Ten or Big 12 to put forth a two-loss conference champion to join Notre Dame and round out the field. If the Irish lose, the Cougars would need one of the Big Ten or Big 12 to collapse down the stretch.\n\nWorst-case scenario: With Washington set to roll past Oregon State on Nov. 17, a Washington State loss in the Apple Cup would give the Huskies the Pac-12 North and send the Cougars hurtling out of contention after falling short in it is biggest game.\n\nNo. 9 West Virginia (7-1)\n\nRemaining games: vs. TCU, at Oklahoma State, vs. No. 6 Oklahoma, vs. opponent in Big 12 championship game (if applicable)\n\nToughest game: Oklahoma. Maybe OU twice, as noted.\n\nHow West Virginia gets in: The most realistic scenario is to win out with two victories against the Sooners in conjunction with an Alabama win against Georgia and the Big Ten putting forth a conference champion with more than one loss (for example, Michigan losing to Northwestern in the conference title game). There\u2019d be more room for WVU to crack the top four should Notre Dame lose, which would then allow four Power Five champions to make the field. If so, you\u2019d like WVU to move ahead of 12-1 Washington State.\n\nWorst-case scenario: WVU loses twice down the stretch and eliminates any chance of reaching the Big 12 title game.\n\nNo. 10 Ohio State (8-1)\n\nRemaining games: at No. 18 Michigan State, at Maryland, vs. No. 4 Michigan, vs. winner of Big Ten West Division (if applicable)\n\nToughest game: Michigan. That Ohio State has owned the series under Urban Meyer seems like ancient history based on the Buckeyes\u2019 struggles and the Wolverines\u2019 performance through two months.\n\nHow Ohio State gets in: Assuming Alabama, Clemson and Notre Dame run the table, all the Buckeyes might need is for the Big 12 to implode in the next month and leave a two-loss team as conference champion. At 12-1, Ohio State would have a case for No. 4 ahead of Washington State and a flurry of two-loss teams.\n\nWorst-case scenario: The Buckeyes lose to Michigan State and Michigan. Even one loss would be a nightmare.", "Zach Johnson with caddie Damon Green on the 17th hole during the first round of the Mayakoba Golf Classic.

He was 92.\n\nThe Detroit Lions and Penn State announced Triplett's death Thursday. Triplett was the third African-American selected in the 1949 draft, but he was the first of those draftees to play in a regular-season game. He played in 24 games for the Lions and Chicago Cardinals.\n\nTriplett was also the first African-American to start for Penn State, and in 1948, he and teammate Dennie Hoggard became the first African-Americans to play in the Cotton Bowl .\n\n\"This is a tremendous loss for not only our football program, but the Penn State community as a whole,\" Penn State coach James Franklin said in a statement. \"Wally was a trailblazer as the first African-American to be drafted and play in the NFL, and his influence continues to live on. He had a profound effect on me and the team when he visited in 2015 and shared valuable lessons from his life story and ability to overcome.\"\n\nTriplett was inducted into the Cotton Bowl Hall of Fame this year, and his appearance in that game is part of Penn State lore. According to the school, the team was asked to consider the possibility of leaving Triplett and Hoggard at home for the game in then-segregated Dallas. Teammates responded by saying: \"We are Penn State, there will be no meetings\" \u2014 a reference to a previous Penn State team that voted to cancel a game at segregated Miami.\n\nThe story remains an important part of Penn State history, especially given the school's well-known \"We Are\" moniker.\n\nTriplett was drafted by the Lions in the 19th round in 1949. He played in 18 games for Detroit from 1949-50. On Oct. 29, 1950, against the Los Angeles Rams, he had 294 yards on four kickoff returns, an NFL record that lasted until 1994.\n\n\"As the first African-American to be drafted and to play in the National Football League, Wally is one of the true trailblazers in American sports history. He resides among the great men who helped reshape the game as they faced the challenges of segregation and discrimination,\" the Lions said in a statement. \"His contributions date back to his days at Penn State as the Nittany Lions' first African-American starter and varsity letter winner, highlighted by his appearance in the first integrated Cotton Bowl. Wally's legacy also reaches beyond breaking color barriers, having served in the United States Army during the Korean War.\"\n\nGeorge Taliaferro was the first black player drafted in the NFL when he went six rounds before Triplett in 1949. Taliaferro also died recently .\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NF L and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

McCown will start at quarterback for the Jets against the Buffalo Bills on Sunday in place of injured rookie Sam Darnold. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) \u2014 Josh McCown is going from mentor to starter this week for the New York Jets.\n\nThe 39-year-old quarterback will be under center Sunday against the Buffalo Bills in place of injured rookie Sam Darnold, who's sidelined with a strained right foot.\n\n\"I'm ready to rule him out as a starter for this week,\" coach Todd Bowles said of Darnold on Thursday. \"I don't know if I'll rule him out yet for the game.\"\n\nThat means Darnold still could potentially be the No. 2 quarterback on Sunday. If not, Davis Webb would be promoted from the practice squad to serve as McCown's backup.\n\nEither way, the starting job is McCown's \u2014 at least for this week.\n\n\"I'm extremely comfortable with him,\" Bowles said. \"We talk all the time. He understands the game and the team, and we see things the same way. So I'm comfortable.\"\n\nMcCown has not taken a snap in a regular-season game this season as the Jets have focused on developing Darnold. The No. 3 overall pick won the job out of training camp, but was injured during New York's 13-6 loss at Miami last Sunday.\n\nMcCown was the Jets' starter last season and had a career year before being sidelined the last three games with a broken left hand. Since the summer, McCown has spoken highly of Darnold and expressed excitement about being able to have a hand in the youngster's development.\n\nDarnold has received lots of advice and tips from McCown on the sideline and practice field. Now, he'll have no choice but to watch.\n\n\"I say it all the time: That's why we do this, to play,\" McCown said Wednesday when Darnold's injury was announced. \"If that's the case, you're torn because your friend and a teammate, it means he can't go. In that regard, I don't wish that on anybody, but at the same time as a professional, as a backup quarterback you have to serve your team in that role and go in and play winning football.\n\n\"That's what's fun, that's what you look forward to and that's why you play this game. And, we'll go out and compete.\"\n\nThe Jets are ranked 29th in overall offense, including 28th in the passing game. Some of the struggles can be attributed to the inexperience of Darnold, who has an NFL-leading 14 interceptions. During New York's current three-game losing streak, the rookie has thrown two touchdown passes and seven INTs.\n\nSo, some might consider the injury a blessing in disguise. It allows Darnold to take a breather and give McCown a chance to perhaps get the offense back on track.\n\n\"Obviously, Josh has played a long time in this league,\" wide receiver Jermaine Kearse said. \"So throughout the weeks, he sees things a lot quicker. Just the mental aspects, he's a lot further, just with his experience and being in the league. So, him just being able to see things a lot quicker, you know, the tempo kind of picked up a little bit.\"\n\nBowles made it clear, however, that this is no long-term solution. When Darnold is healthy, he'll step right back into the starting role.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Bowles said, \"he's our quarterback.\"\n\nEven if McCown is playing well when Darnold is fully healthy?\n\n\"Sam is our quarterback,\" Bowles answered.\n\nBowles was then asked why that would automatically be the case with Darnold.\n\n\"Because he's our starter and he won the job,\" the coach said. \"I feel comfortable with him in there and I feel comfortable with Josh in there.\"\n\nWhile Darnold is the easy target and he has shouldered the blame for the struggles on offense, the Jets have several other culprits. Center Spencer Long has dealt with a finger injury that has led to several wayward snaps out of the shotgun, disrupting the timing of plays. Wide receivers Quincy Enunwa and Robby Anderson have been dealing with ankle injuries, and there have been blown plays and dropped passes by several players.\n\n\"Like I've said, we didn't play well as an offense,\" Bowles said. \"He didn't play well last game, but there's a couple people that have had bad games here and there, so we go from there.\"\n\nOffensive coordinator Jeremy Bates has taken some heat, as well. The Jets are 18th in points with 198 and have scored just 17 touchdowns on offense. They also rank 30th in the league in first-down success (15.8 percent) and third-down conversions (30.8 percent).\n\n\"We have to score more points and that's on me,\" Bates said. \"I need to put our players in better positions to be successful, need to put our players in better position to score touchdowns and that's my responsibility. We have to score points in this league to win football games.\"\n\nNOTES: CB Trumaine Johnson was a full participant at practice for the first time in more than a month after being sidelined with an injured right quadriceps. He's planning to play Sunday. \"Man, it's been a month and a couple days, so I'm definitely ready,\" he said. \"Just sitting out there supporting the team and my teammates is a different feeling, but I'm anxious to get back out there.\" ...

USA TODAY Sports\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones is having a tough year on and off the field. (Photo: Matthew Emmons, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe losses are piling up for Jerry Jones.\n\nI don\u2019t just mean those of his Dallas Cowboys, though they\u2019re contributing more than their fair share to their owner\u2019s woes. Dating back to his failed coup against NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell last year, Jones has found himself on the wrong end of, well, pretty much everything.\n\nHis team stinks. A conduct policy for the national anthem that he advocated has been abandoned. The Congressional candidate he backed lost \u2013 to a former NFL player, of all people. Dez Bryant is now closer to the Super Bowl than Jones and the Cowboys are after signing with the New Orleans Saints.\n\nMore: 7-year-old Cowboys fan writes brutal letter to Jerry Jones: 'WE SUCK'\n\nMore: With matchup vs. Saints looming, Cowboys react to Dez Bryant signing with New Orleans\n\nEven a 7-year-old is taking shots at Jones.\n\n\u201cWE SUCK!\u201d Rylan Wood said in a letter he sent to Jones this week. \u201cWe want to believe in the boys but it\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nPerhaps this is only coincidence. Bad things do tend to come in clusters, after all.\n\nBut it could also be karma, the universe\u2019s way of taking Jones and his outsized ego down a notch or 12.\n\nJones has always considered himself to be the de facto head of the NFL. His Cowboys are the most valuable and, by many measures, most popular team, generating significant revenue for the entire league. Jones also showed his fellow owners how to turn their stadiums into cash cows.\n\nSo when he throws his weight around at league meetings, the rest of the league usually acquiesces.\n\nBut Jones overplayed his hand last year by trying to block Goodell\u2019s contract extension in retaliation for Ezekiel Elliott\u2019s six-game suspension for domestic violence. Not only did Goodell get his new deal, the NFL fined Jones $2 million for what his fellow owners deemed \u201cconduct detrimental to the league.\u201d\n\nIn an indication of just how badly Jones had botched the situation, he was snubbed by Falcons owner Arthur Blank, head of the compensation committee, when the Cowboys visited Atlanta, a stunning breach of the usual congeniality between owners.\n\nThe bad luck has snowballed from there.\n\nFew owners were more insistent, or vocal, than Jones about players not protesting during the national anthem. (Never mind that Jones thinks so highly of the anthem that he couldn\u2019t be bothered to take off his baseball hat, even after being reminded, during a ceremony to open training camp.)\n\nYet a policy that would have allowed players to stay in the locker room during the anthem but required them to stand if they were on the field was tabled after heavy criticism, never to be raised again. A handful of players continue to protest and, when asked, the NFL says it is focusing its efforts on the players\u2019 social justice efforts.\n\nJones didn\u2019t fare any better with his foray into the midterm elections. He backed longtime Republican Rep. Pete Sessions, donating the maximum $2,700 to both his primary and general election campaigns. So did Jones\u2019 wife, daughter and son.\n\nSessions, chair of the Rules Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, was upset Tuesday by Colin Allred, a former linebacker with the Tennessee Titans.\n\nBut the biggest, and surely most stinging, losses for Jones are courtesy of his team.\n\nThe Cowboys have lurched their way to a 3-5 record and, at this rate, they\u2019ll miss the playoffs for the seventh time since 2009. Their offense is abysmal, and Jones has had to give Jason Garrett those dreaded, in-season votes of confidence.\n\nThey\u2019re so dysfunctional even Troy Aikman said they needed a total rebuild.\n\n\u201cI've heard Jerry say, 'OK, look, we're going to do it differently. I'm going to do it differently.' ... But it's the same. Nothing changes,\" the Hall of Fame quarterback said Tuesday in an interview with Dallas radio station 1310 The Ticket.\n\n\"And that to me is the bigger issue.\u201d\n\nOuch.\n\nYou know who else has criticized Jones? Bryant, who the Cowboys parted ways with after last season. It\u2019s not a stretch to say Dallas could use Bryant \u2013 Cole Beasley is your top receiver? Really? \u2013 but he\u2019s landed in a much better spot, signing Wednesday with the Saints.\n\nThose would be the same Saints with the second-best record in the NFC \u2013 and who visit the Cowboys on Nov. 29.\n\nWinning has always meant everything to Jones. If only he could remember what it feels like.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.", "The playoff picture is starting to take shape in the NFL entering Week 9, and a few clubs have all but booked their place in the postseason after fantastic starts to the year.

Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray has star receivers in Marquise Brown and Lamb, yet he doesn\u2019t hesitate to throw to other options.(AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNORMAN, Okla. (AP) \u2014 Many of Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray's best attributes are obvious.\n\nHis powerful arm helped him get selected in the first round of the Major League Baseball draft as an outfielder. His speed has helped make him the second-leading rusher for the sixth-ranked Sooners. His ability to bounce back from mistakes has sparked rallies against Texas and Texas Tech.\n\nOne that's harder to see is the way he trusts Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley's Air Raid system and the players in it. He has star receivers in Marquise Brown and CeeDee Lamb, yet he doesn't hesitate to throw to other options such as receivers Lee Morris and Grant Calcaterra and backs Trey Sermon and Carson Meier. His willingness to spread the wealth plays a role in what could wind up being the highest passer efficiency rating in college football history. Murray's rating of 216.6 blows away Baker Mayfield's mark of 198.9 set during last year's Heisman Trophy-winning season at Oklahoma.\n\n\"It creates the better matchups with your better players,\" Riley said. \"A quarterback has to have a feel for that, without a doubt. Kyler has done a good job throughout the year of moving it around, trusting it. I think that's why he's played at the level he has.\"\n\nMurray's unpredictability makes defending Brown and Lamb more challenging.\n\n\"Our receiver room is pretty good, so we've got a good rotation,\" Murray said. \"I don't really notice who's in the game sometimes. I'm just going through my reads and throwing the ball to the person who's open.\"\n\nMurray also can take off and run. Last week, he became the first Oklahoma player to pass for at least 300 yards and pass for at least 100 in the same game in a 51-46 win over Texas Tech . Murray has 574 yards rushing this season.\n\nOklahoma State has to deal with all those threats on Saturday.\n\n\"You're going to have to try and rally to defend everything, and then you're going to have to try and take care of him (as a runner) secondary,\" Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy said. \"When you are trying to defend a player that is that active, it's not always easy. Which has been evident if you've watched their games this year.\"\n\nBrown is one of the nation's most explosive receivers. He has 45 catches for 814 yards and seven touchdowns. Lamb is a superior playmaker who has a knack for the spectacular grab. He has 38 catches for 725 yards and a team-best nine scores.\n\nMorris, a former walk-on, has 16 catches for 353 yards, a team-best 22.1 yards per catch and eight touchdowns. He caught four passes for 101 yards and two scores against Texas Tech. Murray said Morris is a much different player than he was when they were at Allen (Texas) High School together.\n\n\"Lee was on JV junior year in high school,\" Murray said. \"Not a lot of kids on this level doing what he's doing were on JV their junior year of high school. For him to play one year on varsity and do what he did, and come here and develop into how he's playing, that says a lot about his work ethic and his mindset and want-to.\"\n\nCalcaterra, a preseason all-conference pick at tight end, has 17 catches for 272 yards and two scores. He had some issues with drops earlier in the season, but he made some tough catches in traffic against Texas Tech.\n\n\"For him, I think it's all in the head,\" Murray said. \"Confidence and just playing more. That's all it is. He's obviously got the ability to do it and do what he does. He's here for a reason. I think for him, it's just all playing more and getting confidence out there on the field.\"\n\nAfter he threw interceptions on Oklahoma's first two possessions, Murray came back to throw three touchdown passes \u2014 two to Morris and one to Meier. His 20 completions went to seven receivers, something Riley emphasizes.\n\n\"It's important,\" Riley said. \"There's an art to that because you have to know who your guys are, too. The ball, in this offense, always does tend to find the best players. At the same time, if you go overboard with that, then people can key on that. When you can involve guys like we have, it makes us tougher to defend.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

With the second-place Seahawks (4-4) visiting the Coliseum on Sunday for the rematch, the Rams (8-1) have a chance to essentially end the division race with seven weeks to go. (AP Photo/Scott Eklund, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Although the Los Angeles Rams hadn't lost a game until last week, their spectacular season has featured several close calls.\n\nNot many were closer than their 33-31 victory just five weeks ago in Seattle, where the Seahawks racked up 190 yards rushing, intercepted two passes by Jared Goff and came agonizingly close to a huge NFC West win.\n\nWith the second-place Seahawks (4-4) visiting the Coliseum on Sunday for the rematch, the Rams (8-1) have a chance to essentially end the division race with seven weeks to go. The Rams aren't looking that far ahead, but Aaron Donald hopes Los Angeles will learn from that narrow win in Seattle \u2014 and a 45-35 loss at New Orleans last week.\n\n\"We're in a good place, and we're locked in,\" said the Rams' superstar defensive tackle, second in the NFL with 10 sacks. \"We play these guys twice a year, so we've got respect for them. We've just got to get after them.\"\n\nThe Rams have never lost back-to-back regular-season games in their 1\u00bd seasons under Sean McVay, but they've thrived primarily on the strength of an offense that has been able to outscore nearly every opponent, including the Seahawks. NFL scoring leader Todd Gurley rushed for three TDs in Seattle, and the Rams kept the ball out of Russell Wilson's hands in the final 3:38 by running out the clock.\n\nThe Seahawks also are coming off a loss after the Chargers won in Seattle last week, but the Seahawks know they can beat the Rams because they did it last season at the Coliseum.\n\nEven if the division race might already be out of hand, they've got a chance to begin their playoff rally with a statement victory.\n\n\"We can't allow them to score as many points as they put up,\" Seattle linebacker Bobby Wagner said. \"We feel like we did a really good job against the run for the most part. We have to find a way to do that, make them one-dimensional, make sure Todd doesn't get into the end zone as many times as he did.\"\n\nMore things to watch in this NFC West showdown:\n\nTOUGH CHECK\n\nDonald has sacked Wilson eight times in their careers, more than any other quarterback. But Donald and the Rams didn't manage to sack Drew Brees last week, and they still have something to prove to the Seahawks \u2014 particularly to guard D.J. Fluker, who wasn't impressed by the toughness of the Los Angeles defense in the clubs' previous meeting.\n\nThe Seattle offensive lineman said the Rams \"want to be pass rushers,\" but hadn't \"seen a team go out there and actually take it to them.\" Donald had no interest in starting a public discussion this week: \"We're just going to go out there and play a game and let our play speak for us.\"\n\nRUN AROUND\n\nSeattle's impressive rushing performance in their first meeting with the Rams included 116 yards from Chris Carson, but he is in question for the rematch because of a hip injury that caused him to sit the final 2\u00bd quarters last week against the Chargers. Mike Davis and seldom-used Rashaad Penny probably would replace Carson.\n\nBut Seattle also has offensive line concerns after Fluker injured his calf late in the loss to the Chargers. Fluker's addition to the offensive line helped spark Seattle's turnaround in the run game starting in late September.\n\nGURLEY GOES\n\nGurley has scored a touchdown in a franchise-record 12 straight games, and his 868 yards rushing are the NFL's most by a whopping 162 yards over Pittsburgh's James Connor.\n\nGurley's 16 TDs this season are the most in the league and the second-most in NFL history through nine games, trailing only Jim Brown's 17 in 1958. That's the challenge facing Seattle's run defense, which is giving up 4.8 yards per attempt \u2014 tied for fourth-worst in the league \u2014 but has been effective in stretches.\n\nGET MARCUS\n\nFormer Washington Huskies defensive back Marcus Peters was targeted repeatedly by the Saints, and the Rams' top corner took the blame for much of Brees' success. The Seahawks undoubtedly saw the former Pro Bowl cover man's struggles on video, but Rams defensive coordinator Wade Phillips has limited options in the continued injury absence of cornerback Aqib Talib. The Rams' best solution might be increased pressure on Wilson, who has been sacked 25 times already this season.\n\nSAFETY PLAN\n\nBradley McDougald has been one of Seattle's defensive standouts, but with a quick turnaround to facing Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers next Thursday, McDougald may end up sitting out against the Rams because of a bothersome knee injury. If McDougald can't play, the Seahawks would turn to second-year safety Delano Hill, which could create an extremely young secondary. If Hill starts, he would play alongside second-year free safety Tedric Thompson, second-year cornerback Shaquill Griffin and rookie cornerback Tre Flowers. Nickel cornerback Justin Coleman, in his fourth season, would be the veteran of the group.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Tim Booth in Seattle contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.apnews.com/NFL and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Nov. 7) AP\n\nTrump's border hysteria didn't sway the suburbs. The new divided government should address fears and build the immigration consensus America wants.\n\nCentral American caravan in Mexico City on Nov. 6, 2018. (Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nIn the final weeks of a bloody and bruising campaign, President Donald Trump looked past the center and played to his base, fomenting anti-immigrant hysteria in terms and tactics unprecedented for a White House in modern times.\n\nNot even the worst attack on American Jews in American history, one inspired by anti-immigrant sentiments, would stop the president\u2019s musings about ending birthright citizenship and deploying 15,000 troops to the southern border to address migrants 900 miles away fleeing violence and poverty.\n\nWhile the strategy kept the Senate in Republican hands, the president's rhetoric failed to keep suburban districts in the conservative column. As a result, Democrats will lead the House.\n\nWe are at a \u201cbloody crossroads\u201d of culture and politics, as Fareed Zakaria wrote last month. Which begs the question: with divided government, where do we go on immigration in 2019 and beyond? To answer that very question, earlier this year the group I lead \u2014 the National Immigration Forum \u2014 traveled to dozens of mostly rural and suburban towns for a series of \u201cliving room conversations\u201d to learn firsthand how ordinary people are grappling with immigration in their own communities.\n\nDivided government can unite on immigration\n\nWe met with mothers and fathers across the income and education spectrum. We wanted to understand how we might change the conversation from one that polarizes to one that unifies. From Spartanburg, South Carolina, to Storm Lake, Iowa, we found that anxieties are palpable \u2014 but overcoming them is possible.\n\nWith a Democratic House, a Republican Senate, Trump in the White House and millions of Americans in suburban communities looking for consensus, we have a chance to unite the country around immigration and make policy reforms that improve the system.\n\nFirst, we need to acknowledge the underlying anxiety. Fears around identity, culture, security and a changing economy course through American life. As we saw during this election cycle, Republicans seek to divide us on those fears, while Democrats wish they would go away.\n\nLeft with nowhere to go are two-thirds of the American public \u2014 or, as More in Common\u2019s research identified them, the \u201cExhausted Majority.\u201d Their views on different issues range across the spectrum but they share certain characteristics: they are turned off by polarization, disregarded in the public discourse, and quite flexible in their views.\n\nMore: Trump public benefits rule would turn away immigrants like the ones who built America\n\nOpen hearts, minds on menu at Syrian refugee's falafel shop, the 'Nicest Place in America'\n\nRepublicans should support work visas. They'd help business and ease the caravan problem.\n\nThese are the Americans we spoke to in our living room conversations across the country \u2014 the voters who sought a new direction.\n\nIt\u2019s when we listen to people\u2019s immigration-related fears in order to rebuild a sense of curiosity and respect \u2014 in the congregation, the community center, and the Chamber of Commerce \u2014 that we can develop a common vision that ensures we can remain a nation of laws and a nation of grace. Because the policy reforms are broadly supported: fixing the U.S. legal immigration system, increasing security at our borders and ports of entry, and offering legal residency and eventual citizenship to those law-abiding, undocumented men and women already here working and contributing.\n\nThe challenges of making progress on this issue won\u2019t abate. Global migration will continue to grow, our country will continue to diversify, and the economy will continue to evolve. Until political leadership can step up to this challenge, it will be the leadership of the pastor, the police chief, the local business owner that helps us see beyond the divisions.\n\nAmericans want consensus on immigration\n\nThat means acknowledging that millions of Americans are grappling with concerns around security, the economy, and culture. It means recognizing that people are wondering how America\u2019s identity is being reshaped. And it means reminding the American public that immigrants have always been, and will continue to be, key drivers of a dynamic, growing and innovative economy, adding the cultural vitality and diversity that makes us the envy of the world.\n\nThis is uncomfortable territory, but it\u2019s not uncharted territory. From the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 to the Immigration Act of 1924, which set out to limit Italians, Greeks, Poles, and certain Jews among others from coming to the U.S., we were scapegoating newcomers long before the 2018 midterms.\n\nAs the 2020 election nears, both parties will play to their geographic and structural advantages, further stressing a divided nation. Immigration can bridge the gap or widen it. Most voters yearn for leaders who will forge a new consensus on American immigration. That's an opportunity we should take.\n\nAli Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, is host of the \u201cOnly in America\u201d podcast and author of \u201cThere Goes the Neighborhood: How Communities Overcome Prejudice and Meet the Challenge of American Immigration.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @anoorani\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

Speedy outfielder and leadoff hitter Mallex Smith has been acquired by the Seattle Mariners from the Tampa Bay Rays for catcher Mike Zunino and outfielder Guillermo Heredia as part of a five-player deal. (AP Photo/Steve Nesius, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Mallex Smith was made a promise by Seattle general manager Jerry Dipoto when he was acquired for a second time by the Mariners after an initial tenure that lasted less than two hours.\n\n\"Dipoto didn't guarantee anything, but he said I at least have 78 minutes,\" Smith joked. \"We'll see.\"\n\nSmith is back with the Mariners as part of a five-player deal between Seattle and Tampa Bay on Thursday that landed the Rays catcher Mike Zunino and outfielder Guillermo Heredia.\n\nThe swap continued a lengthy trade history between the teams and came as a surprise to Zunino, who said he had recent conversations with Seattle manager Scott Servais looking ahead to 2019.\n\n\"I was shocked. To see your name in trade talks, let alone this early in the offseason, was beyond my expectations,\" Zunino said.\n\nSmith, 25, stole a career-best 40 bases this year and was caught 12 times. He hit .296, tied for the major league lead with 10 triples and had 40 RBIs. He is not eligible for free agency until after the 2022 season. He signed with San Diego in 2012, was traded to Atlanta in December 2014 and was dealt to the Mariners in January 2017, then sent to the Rays on the same day in a trade that shipped left-hander Drew Smyly to Seattle.\n\nHis previous Seattle stint lasted all of 77 minutes before he was sent to the Rays.\n\n\"Bringing Mallex back home to Seattle is exciting for us all,\" Dipoto said in a statement. \"His combination of speed, base running impact, defense and on-base abilities are unique in today's game. We believe his breakout 2018 performance reflects the many ways his skills will positively impact the Mariners for years to come.\"\n\nSmith said he's going in with the idea of playing in center field, which would allow Seattle to move Dee Gordon to his natural position of second base. But the move for Smith could just be the start of a hectic offseason overhaul for the Mariners.\n\n\"I feel like it's a good fit. I feel like the team wants me,\" Smith said. \"It's very comfortable when you know the team wants you. Jerry has traded for me twice, so I feel like I'll fit in well here.\"\n\nHeredia, who turns 28 in January, hit .236 with five homers and 19 RBIs in 337 plate appearances as a fourth outfielder for the Mariners this year. He is not eligible for free agency until after the 2022 season.\n\nZunino, 27, was taken by Seattle with the third overall pick in the 2012 amateur draft and signed for a $4 million bonus. He hit just .201 this year but had 20 homers with 44 RBIs, down from a .251 average, 25 homers and 64 RBIs in 2017. While well-regarded for his defense, he has struck out 310 times in 760 at-bats during the past two seasons.\n\nZunino said an oblique injury just before the start of the regular season caused him to struggle at the plate and led to his drop from the progress he had shown as a hitter in 2017.\n\n\"It really took me longer than I'd like. I came back and it took me longer than I would have liked to get comfortable,\" Zunino said. \"Once that happened, I ended up giving away too many at-bats ... tried to chase too much. I think getting back to that, trying to take care of my body, getting back to 100 percent is the main goal. I feel great now.\"\n\nZunino grew up in Cape Coral, Florida, and played for the University of Florida. He made $2,975,000 this year, is eligible for salary arbitration and can become a free agent following the 2020 season.\n\nSeattle also sent minor league left-handed pitcher Michael Plassmeyer to Tampa Bay while the Rays sent minor league outfielder Jake Fraley to the Mariners.\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum in Carlsbad, California, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Marvin O. Jimenez)\n\nMALIBU, California \u2013 Popular apps that let parents and friends track each other in real time offered up the possibility of hope for some and dread for others in the aftermath of a horrific shooting at a Southern Californian bar where 13 people died.\n\nThe apps show locations for those who have signed onto them and are popular among groups of friends and also in families, where parents frequently put them on their children's phones so they know where they are. Friends use them to find each other and keep in touch.\n\n\"I used Snap Map to see if my friends were OK,\" said Aubrey Stanchak, 20, a junior at Pepperdine University in Malibu. Students at the school often frequent the Borderline Bar and Grill, where the shooting unfolded late Wednesday night.\n\nStanchak checked to make sure her friends who lived near the shooting were at their houses in the middle of the night, and finding them there gave her comfort.\n\n\"Knowing they hadn't been active on Snapchat and they were in a place and they'd been there for a while made me feel like, 'OK, they're settled, nothing's happened,'\" she said.\n\nMore: Mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, Calif., bar\n\nMore: What we know about Thousand Oaks gunman Ian David Long, a Marine veteran\n\nMore: Tamera Mowry-Housley and husband frantically search for niece after Thousand Oaks shooting\n\nIn the case of the Thousand Oaks shooting, some families were watching the apps with a sense of grim foreboding as their loved ones appeared to still be checked in at the Borderline Bar and Grill, where Thursday morning only bodies remained.\n\n\u201cThe upside is it\u2019s more information than you would otherwise have, which in those situations can be either reassuring or devastating,\u201d said Sierra Filucci, executive editor of parenting content at Common Sense Media, a non-profit that promotes safe technology and media for children.\n\nAdam Housley told the Los Angeles Times that his niece\u2019s Apple Watch and iPhone were showing her location as being on the dance floor at the bar in Thousand Oaks.\n\n\u201cMy gut is saying she\u2019s inside the bar, dead,\u201d he told the paper.\n\nSheriff Geoff Dean here with an update on the #ThousandOaksShooting Shooter was a former Marine pic.twitter.com/G5WhsQAkf8 \u2014 Brittny Mejia (@brittny_mejia) November 8, 2018\n\nFather Jason Coffman told CNN that his son's tracking app on his phone confirmed he was at the club.\n\n\"It's there, it's not moving, that\u2019s the problem,\" he told the network.\n\nApps such as Life360, FindMyFriends Snapchat's Snap Map and others allow those who've signed on to make themselves trackable.\n\nLife360, for example, saw a spike in app activity in Thousand Oaks starting at 2:00 am Thursday and by 4:00 am was seeing twice the normal number of app sessions in the area, said spokeswoman Sara Sutyak.\n\nThey are popular, though controversial, among parents. Some call them \"stalking apps\" and say they detract from trust within families. Others consider them a way to ensure children are safe in an unsafe world.\n\nIn San Francisco, mom Carrie Wonzer uses Find My IPhone to keep track of her teens.\n\n\"They know I use it and are sometimes annoyed but they have no expectation of privacy at 15 years old. I have found this to be helpful when they are on the bus and I am trying to pick them up \u2013 I look up their location and head for the next bus stop and tell them to get off the bus,\" she said.\n\nEnabling this kind of tracking is often a struggle for parents who grew up in a time when they had much more independence, away from the eyes of their parents, and comes with both pros and cons.\n\n\u201cFor me as a parent, it helps me feel more comfortable letting my kids explore. That reassurance that I can look on my phone and see that they are where they said they were going, or that they\u2019re on their way back home, allows me to feel more comfortable,\u201d said Filucci.\n\nFor the digital generation, FindMyFriends and Snapchat's Snap Map are a way to keep track of where their friends are, to find them to hang out with and generally keep track of them.\n\nPrevious generations had to rely on having many conversations and building trust with their children to ensure they stayed safe. Today there\u2019s the option of simply tracking them.\n\n\u201cThe important thing,\u201d cautioned Filucci, \"is that parents don\u2019t use [these programs] as a substitute for all those important conversations.\u201d\n\nOne issue these apps do raise is that of privacy. For example, a group of researchers at Oxford University in England that studies third-party tracking looked into what information Life360 was collecting and sharing when asked by USA TODAY.\n\nAs of 2017, Life360 shared data with multiple third parties, including Facebook, Google, three third-party mobile marking firms and two location-based mobile marketing firms.\n\nWhile this information is mentioned in the company\u2019s privacy policy, it\u2019s fairly likely that \"most people who use life360 probably aren't aware that these third parties are embedded in the app and collecting information about them,\u201d said Max Van Kleek, a professor of computer science at Oxford University.\n\nLife360's Sutyak noted that data provided to third parties has all personal characteristics stripped off and that users can opt out of data collection.\n\nFor Van Kleek, the tragedy in Thousand Oaks \u201cillustrates the complexities and tradeoffs of privacy and transparency especially during emergencies.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/08/thousand-oaks-shooting-victims-tracking-apps-offer-hope-dread/1929963002/", "bad url", "", "bad url", "", "bad url", "bad url", "Have you heard? Alabama is good at football.\n\nThe perennially dominant, annoyingly talented and masterfully crafted Crimson Tide squad is, somehow, even better in 2018 than past years as it seems like it will have no trouble defending its College Football Playoff title. Forget the other 129 FBS teams out there \u2014 this Alabama group is shaping up to be Nick Saban\u2019s best team, maybe better than the five national championship ones from the last nine years.\n\nWith a devastatingly lethal offense led by quarterback (and basically already the Heisman Trophy winner) Tua Tagovailoa, this team is impossible to stop. No amount of scouting and film study can prepare opponents to slow it down. They\u2019d need the football equivalent of the Monstars, and they\u2019d still probably lose by a couple touchdowns.\n\nObviously undefeated through nine games, it\u2019s the Crimson Tide and everyone else is in another zip code.\n\nSo for the sake of this sport, its bowl games and its season, let\u2019s just agree to declare the unquestionably best team the national champions, send the trophy to Saban and co. and come up with some new title the four next-best teams can fight over.\n\nHOW did he keep his feet in?? pic.twitter.com/k2M0liUCkY \u2014 CBS Sports (@CBSSports) November 4, 2018\n\nUsing the latest College Football Playoff rankings, we\u2019d have Clemson play Georgia and a Notre Dame-Michigan rematch, and the eventual winner of that bracket will get a trophy with \u201cNo. 1 Team in the Nation (Not Named Alabama)\u201d engraved on it. Those matchups sound far more competitive and entertaining than watching the Crimson Tide wreck everyone else on their way to Saban\u2019s millionth championship.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re a Mississippi State, Auburn or Georgia fan (sorry, The Citadel), perhaps you\u2019re under the wildly misguided impression that your team can pull off an unfathomable upset. That false hope is somewhat understandable because, hey, aren\u2019t insane finishes a huge reason why the masses tune in every Saturday?\n\nThe problem is not one single thing about the blowouts and bloodbaths this season suggests any of the teams left on Alabama\u2019s schedule can survive.\n\nSaban and his future NFL Pro-Bowlers are averaging more than 50 points a game and destroying their opponents by a 37.2-point margin. Their offense is No. 1 in points and yards per game, among multiple other stat categories, and the bulldozing offensive line protects Tagovailoa so thoroughly that it took nine games for him to throw his first interception this season.\n\nAlabama has also played most of the season with two quarterbacks \u2014 can\u2019t forget Jalen Hurts, the 2016 and 2017 starter, is still on the roster \u2014 and sometimes they\u2019re both on the field together.

The emergence of first-round draft pick Lamar Jackson and a three-game losing streak have raised questions about the relationship of coach Jim Harbaugh and Flacco, who reached the postseason in their first five years together and capped the run with a Super Bowl victory. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 Having worked in unison for 11 seasons with the Baltimore Ravens, John Harbaugh and Joe Flacco are under pressure to extend their extraordinary bond to an even dozen years.\n\nThe emergence of first-round draft pick Lamar Jackson and a three-game losing streak have raised questions about the future of a coach and quarterback who reached the postseason in each of their first five seasons together and capped the run with a Super Bowl victory.\n\nRecently, however, the Ravens have stumbled. They've missed the postseason for three consecutive years and entered their bye week with a 4-5 record.\n\nGeneral manager Ozzie Newsome will step down after this season, and Baltimore's performance over the last seven games could go a long way toward determining if the transition will extend to a change at head coach and/or quarterback.\n\nFollowing a lackluster 2017 season that could be attributed in part to a slow-healing back injury, Flacco has been solid this year. He's thrown for 2,465 yards and has 12 touchdown passes with only six interceptions.\n\nThough Harbaugh has allowed the fleet-footed and elusive Jackson to receive several snaps each game, he's not about to make a quarterback change at this pivotal point in the season.\n\n\"Joe has played well, so I don't want to get into all of that,\" Harbaugh said. \"We're rolling right now with what we have.\"\n\nHarbaugh took the job as Ravens coach in 2008 with Flacco as a rookie quarterback. Flacco started the opener, the first of his 163 regular-season games under Harbaugh \u2014 second-most in NFL history by a quarterback who's spent his entire career with the same head coach. Only Tom Brady and Bill Belichick have more (260).\n\nBut the Ravens didn't trade up to get Jackson just to keep the 2016 Heisman Trophy winner on the sideline. The former Louisville star ranks second on the team with 139 yards rushing and has completed seven of 12 passes, most of them during mop-up duty.\n\nThe challenge for Harbaugh is to determine when, and how often, to use the rookie. It's a tricky problem, in part because the Ravens often keep Flacco in the game when Jackson enters so the defense won't know who will take the snap when the huddle breaks. If Jackson is the quarterback, then Flacco lines up as a receiver who almost certainly won't be a target.\n\n\"I sure hope not,\" Flacco said with a grin.\n\nJackson ran for 4,132 yards and 50 touchdowns at Louisville. He's far more of a threat with his legs than the 33-year-old Flacco, leaving the opposition to guess whether Jackson will keep the ball, hand it off or pass.\n\n\"The stats say we're over twice as effective running the ball with Lamar on the field. That's even with the 10-man football that people say we're playing,\" Harbaugh said. \"The numbers don't lie there. That's probably why I say I'd like to get him on the field more, because you always want to do things that are effective more.\"\n\nThough unyieldingly loyal to Flacco, Harbaugh didn't dismiss the possibility of using Jackson for an entire series.\n\n\"I would say that's an option, yes,\" Harbaugh said.\n\nThe strange thing about all this is that the Ravens have not made use of another quarterback who has started in 41 NFL games, including the playoffs. Retained as part of the 53-man roster in case Flacco or Jackson gets hurt, Robert Griffin III has been inactive every game this season.\n\nWhether Griffin gets to play remains to be seen. For now, the Ravens are focused on finding the right mix between Flacco and Jackson.\n\nJackson enjoys contributing, though he would prefer better results.\n\n\"It's very cool, but I feel like I need to do more,\" he said. \"We need to score more points. I've got to help my team move the ball.\"\n\nThe Ravens planned to use the bye week to rest and get healthy. Starting tackles James Hurst (back) and Ronnie Stanley (ankle) missed a 23-16 loss to Pittsburgh last Sunday, and it's essential that Baltimore have a full offensive line against Cincinnati at home next week.\n\nThe defense has to get better, too. After getting 11 sacks in a 21-0 rout of Tennessee on Oct. 14, the Ravens have yielded 83 points during a skid that has put their postseason chances in jeopardy.\n\n\"We're not eliminated yet. We're in a hole, and now we have to dig ourselves out,\" safety Eric Weddle said. \"We just have to get our minds refreshed and refocused, then come back and get after it.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The weekend's only matchup of ranked ACC teams shapes up as BC's biggest home game in years. Nobody's been able to knock off three-time league champion Clemson (9-0, 6-0, No. 2 CFP), but AJ Dillon and the Eagles (7-2, 4-1, No. 17 CFP) might have the personnel and the game plan to test the Tigers. With a victory, Clemson will wrap up yet another spot in the ACC title game.\n\nBEST MATCHUP\n\nMiami's run defense vs. Georgia Tech's rushing offense. The Hurricanes' defense has ranked among the ACC's best all season, but they've run into trouble in their last two games \u2014 giving up a season-worst 223 yards rushing at BC and 146 yards on the ground to Duke. Miami is 1-4 when its opponent runs for more than 115 yards. That's a bad sign against a Georgia Tech team that leads the FBS with an average of 377 yards rushing.\n\nINSIDE THE NUMBERS\n\nIt's been a while since this many ACC schools have appeared \u2014 however briefly \u2014 in the AP Top 25. Nine teams have cycled into the national rankings, tying a league record set in 2008. The ACC joins the SEC as the only schools to place nine teams in the polls.

(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 With the economy sailing along, another interest rate hike is almost certainly in the cards next month.\n\nThe Federal Reserve held its key short-term rate steady Thursday but maintained its upbeat view of the economy, setting the stage for a fourth rate increase in 2018 at its Dec. 18-19 meeting.\n\nAs expected, the Fed\u2019s policymaking committee kept the benchmark rate at a range of 2 percent to 2\u00bc percent. But futures markets say there\u2019s a 75 percent chance the central bank will bump it up again next month, according to CME Group, nudging up borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Fed officials expect \"further gradual\" rate increases and have forecast three more hikes next year.\n\nIn a statement after a two-day meeting, the Fed described both economic and job growth as \u201cstrong.\u201d The economy has turned in its best six-month stretch since 2014 while unemployment is at a near 50-year low.\n\nAlthough economists say President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating trade war with China helped dampen business capital spending gains in the third quarter, the Fed didn\u2019t explicitly mention the conflict. Its statement, however, did note that business investment \u201chas moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year.\u201d\n\nTrump slapped a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion in Chinese imports in late September while China struck back by imposing duties on $60 billion in U.S. goods. The measures are increasing costs and narrowing profit margins for some U.S. companies while hammering exports for others.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the standoff sparked growing concerns among businesses around the country but hasn\u2019t yet crimped the economy\u2019s overall performance.\n\nThe Fed statement also steered clear of any mention of financial market worries. The stock market plunged after peaking in early October, though stocks pared their losses this week. Also, the dollar has strengthened this year, making U.S. exports more expensive overseas.\n\nTrump has taken the highly unusual step of criticizing Powell and the Fed, an independent agency, for lifting rates and impeding the faster economic growth he has promised. He told the Wall Street Journal he \u201cmaybe\u201d regrets appointing Powell. The Fed chairman said in September that Fed officials \u201cdon\u2019t consider political factors or things like that.\u201d\n\nThe economy\n\nThe Fed said \u201ceconomic activity has been rising at a strong rate.\u201d It added that \u201chousehold spending has continued to grow strongly.\u201d\n\nThe economy grew at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said last month. That followed a 4.2 percent gain in the prior quarter and capped the best six-month stretch since mid-2014.\n\nMany economists expect growth to slow next year as the effects of the Republican tax cuts and spending increases fade and the trade war potentially takes a bigger toll. While 3 percent growth is widely predicted for this year \u2014 the fastest clip since 2015\u2014 many economists predict a recession in 2020.\n\nJobs\n\n\u201cThe labor market has continued to strengthen,\u201d the Fed said, adding that \u201cjob gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined.\u201d\n\nMonthly job growth totaled 250,000 last month, surging in part because of a weak showing in September as result of Hurricane Florence. Employment gains have averaged a robust 213,000 this year despite an unemployment rate that has reached a 49-year low of 3.7 percent, making it harder for businesses to find available workers.\n\nAverage wages were up 3.1 percent annually last month, fastest since 2009. Although economists say the increase was exaggerated by weak average pay in October 2017, the tight labor market is expected to continue to push pay increases above 3 percent.\n\nInflation\n\nThe Fed said inflation remained near its 2 percent annual target.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s preferred measure of overall inflation fell from 2.2 percent to 2 percent in September. A core reading that strips out volatile food and energy items remained at 2 percent. In other words, the economy and inflation are precisely where the Fed would like them to be \u2013 not too hot and not too cold.\n\nWhat it means\n\nWith the economy and labor market humming, the Fed has little reason to veer from its delicate balancing act: Gradually raising rates to head off a potential run-up in inflation without disrupting the nine-year-old economic expansion. Its bullish view of the economy Thursday suggests another rate hike is in the offing for December.\n\nWhile the trade war is a trouble spot, it\u2019s not yet hindering the economy broadly. Any mention of it or the market turbulence would have signaled the Fed could soon slow its rate hikes, a message Fed policymakers don\u2019t want to convey.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/08/interest-rates-federal-reserve-steady-december-hike/1925355002/", "A record 54 million people will travel for Thanksgiving this year, according to AAA.

(AP Photo/Ron Schwane) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Patrick Mahomes had been shredding the Patriots defense all night with his incredible arm strength and downfield precision in a back-and-forth shootout last month when it looked as if the Chiefs quarterback might be finally corralled by a well-timed blitz.\n\nWith a deft flip of his wrist, Mahomes instead tossed a soft screen pass to Kareem Hunt out of the backfield, and he raced up the field as the Patriots were forced to chase him.\n\nThe timing was perfect. The execution was spot-on.\n\nIt was just one of dozens of examples through the first nine games this season of coach Andy Reid using the screen pass to impressive effect.\n\nWhether it's Hunt out of the backfield, Tyreek Hill or Sammy Watkins on a bubble screen or even tight end Travis Kelce catching a short pass behind the defense, the Chiefs may use their myriad variations of the screen better than any other team.\n\n\"You are really just taking a blocking scheme and moving it out into space,\" Reid explained. \"Our backs are good with it, quarterback gives them an opportunity and the big guys get out and run.\"\n\nThe intricate timing plays are fun for just about everybody.\n\nMahomes likes them because the throws are fairly easy and often lead to big gains. Hunt and fellow running back Spencer Ware like them because they can use their talent in space. And even the offensive linemen like them because they often get to plow through smaller defensive backs, rather than tangle with big defensive tackles as they would do on a traditional running play.\n\nOh, and the Chiefs' fans like them for obvious reasons.\n\nScreen passes are hardly new in the NFL, and indeed, they have been part of Reid's basic West Coast offense since he was learning the scheme from its originator, Bill Walsh.\n\nBut with so many playmakers at his disposal, and a quarterback who is finally capable of executing the variety of plays, Reid has taken the old-school notion of screen passes to another level.\n\nThey might incorporate elements of the run-pass option, a relatively new development that has swept through the NFL.\n\nOr they might call for guys to line up in unique spots, such as running backs split wide or a wide receiver in the backfield. Or they might call for exotic blocking schemes.\n\n\"It's a timing thing. We have to be in sync with our offensive line,\" Ware said. \"Our releases are a big part of it \u2014 how we escape. The downfield ball with Tyreek, Sammy, Travis and Mahomes throwing it opens it up for us. Then when you have Kareem running how he's running, they come up and play the run and it's like, 'No, it's not a run, it's a pass. You'd better get back.' That gives us some cushion.\"\n\nSuch screen plays often look simple, but are in fact quite difficult to execute.\n\nMahomes has to read the defense correctly in the seconds before a snap. The designated target needs to be on the same page. And as Hunt explained, \"there's just a lot of timing involved.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Mahomes added, \"but with how well Coach Reid explains it, everything goes off each other. I think we had a screen and it went off a shovel pass to Kareem the week before, things like that, where we build on top of each other every single week. We are never set in our ways.\"\n\nThat's another reason the Chiefs' screen passes are so difficult to defend: They may run a play to one target one week, giving the next opponent film to review, then run the play to a different target out of the exact same formation the following week.\n\nGood luck trying to stop that.\n\n\"Asking these guys to go against faster players, for your offensive linemen to go against these defensive backs and block them in space, that's tough to do,\" Reid said.\n\n\"We're fortunate our backs do a nice job of this. They help set up the defense so you can run fast. There's nothing worse than watching a screen, you get out there and the offensive linemen are out there trying to dance a little bit.\n\n\"A back can take care of you with that,\" Reid concluded. \"As long as you know where he's at, he's going to kind of force the issue downhill, good things can happen.\"\n\nNotes: Strong safety Eric Berry (heel), OL Cam Erving (illness), LB Anthony Hitchens (ribs), WR Sammy Watkins (foot) and C Mitch Morse (concussion) remained out of practice Thursday. ... Special teams coach Dave Toub dismissed a couple of recent missed PATs, saying Thursday that \"nobody is harder on himself\" than PK Harrison Butker. Toub said snaps have been part of the problem, \"and again, it's a 33-yard field goal. It's not a chip-shot like it used to be.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 With the NFL's volcanic offenses, can't-hit-them-too-hard rules and bewildered officials, linebackers today aren't the snarling 250-pound thumpers who used to just give running backs fits.\n\n\"Now we have to cover well, too,\" Denver's Brandon Marshall said. \"We still have to tackle well. So, you can't be real light and only playing pass or too heavy and only playing run. You've got to be able to do all of it, man.\"\n\nWhich means finding a sweet spot on the scale so they can run like a gazelle and still hit like a truck.\n\nToday's inside linebackers not only need to have the stamina to go sideline to sideline, but they also require:\n\n\u2014sufficient strength to shed 320-pound linemen;\n\n\u2014enough vigor to cover towering tight ends;\n\n\u2014ample speed to keep up with receivers no longer timid about going over the middle;\n\n\u2014enough recognition and quickness to keep up with shifty running backs and ever-more-mobile quarterbacks.\n\nIt's also handy to have a thick skin, knowing linebackers will bear the brunt of fans' frustrations as offenses pick apart apparently defenseless units at a record-setting pace.\n\nSounds impossible.\n\n\"It almost is,\" Broncos coach Vance Joseph said. \"It almost is.\"\n\n\"It's definitely very difficult,\" Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr said. \"You have tight ends that provide mismatches, you've got running backs that are great receivers. You're asked to be in a lot of positions. But that's what we get paid to do. So, we've got figure out a way to do it and do it well.\"\n\nAs do the officials, whom Joseph said are allowing illegal blocks with the run-pass option rage that has seeped from the college game and is prominently featured in places such as Kansas City, Philadelphia and Seattle.\n\nTake the Broncos' loss to the Chiefs in Week 8.\n\nLinemen aren't allowed to block more than a yard from the line of scrimmage on a pass play. But the Chiefs' guards and center got a few yards downfield several times, causing Denver's linebackers to instinctively commit to the run \u2014 only to see quarterback Patrick Mahomes pull the ball back from running back Kareem Hunt's belly and zip it to wide-open tight end Travis Kelce.\n\n\"It's the league we're in,\" Joseph said. \"Those guys blocking up front don't know the ball is being thrown. They're blocking zone, so absolutely it's an issue. We have to fix this issue in this league, unless it's going to be college football.\n\n\"It's tough for the linebackers to play both, and you see it on tape. Todd Davis is having hell trying to fit his gap and chase the guy in the flat. When you see Kelce in the flat over there with no one around him, (Davis is) playing his run gap because the guard and center are four and five yards down the field.\"\n\nJoseph added, \"That's an issue. It's a leaguewide issue and it's a Chiefs issue. Everyone is running these plays, so we have to figure out a way to officiate this better to help the game.\"\n\nMarshall isn't so sure the league's competition committee will do anything about it, though, saying more points equals more eyeballs.\n\n\"They're not going to change it,\" he said.\n\nSo it's the linebackers who are changing.\n\nDavis, the Broncos' leading tackler, said he's dropped his weight to 233 and \"I do a lot more training with DBs and corners. I add that on to what I already did in the weight room and running and conditioning. But now I have to be ready for everything in the pass game, as well.\"\n\nThe linebackers who are modifying their bodies and games are embracing the challenge.\n\n\"It's the NFL,\" Titans linebacker Wesley Woodyard said. \"There's great players at every position.\"\n\nIncluding linebacker.\n\n\"I love it,\" Davis said. \"It's on us to play well and it's on us to set the tempo and be great for our team. I wouldn't have it any other way.\"\n\nMarshall said linebackers ultimately benefit from the ever-increasing challenges brought on by the RPO trend, faster rushers, bigger tight ends and plucky receivers.\n\n\"It's made me a better player,\" Marshall said. \"It's also made me more valuable.\"\n\n\"I think that's why teams put a premium on athletic 'backers,\" Marshall said. \"Because we have to be out there to cover the Kelces and the Gronks and the Dion Lewises and the James Whites of the world. And then we've got to be able to tackle (Todd) Gurley. That's just how it is.\"\n\nDefenses are employing more defensive backs, as many as seven, to combat the RPO trend.\n\n\"I think schematically we have to adjust as far as personnel and put faster athletes, better athletes at cover linebacker positions to nullify some of this stuff,\" Joseph said. \"Because right now it's almost impossible physically.\"\n\nJoseph thinks he has an antidote in Su'a Cravens, and the 6-foot-1, 220-pound safety from USC who's used as a dime linebacker certainly agrees.\n\n\"The way the rules are, they handicap defenses. We're basically on the field to get in the way, we're not supposed to stop the offense,\" Cravens said. \"Defense is already hard enough. They're making it harder.\n\n\"So, with guys like me, I think it's an opportunity for us to showcase what we can do because they're making it hard for traditional linebackers who are heavy-handed, heavy-footed. They're ready to be physical at the line of scrimmage and they can't do that anymore.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Teresa M.

We've gathered some advice and tips from the Rockstar brain trust and video game journalists who reviewed the game to aid your explorations in \"Red Dead Redemption 2\" ($60, for Microsoft Xbox One and Sony PlayStation 4, rated Mature for ages 17-up).\n\n\u2022Camp counsel. Early in the game, your protagonist, Arthur Morgan, and the rest of the Van der Linde gang set up camp in the mountainous Horseshoe Overlook. As you earn money, you will want to use the ledger to improve the camp, says Matt Bertz, managing editor of Game Informer, who reviewed the game for the site. Doing so \"unlocks the ability to store horses, resupply valuable consumables like ammunition, and fast travel right from your camp,\" he said.\n\nArthur Gies, who reviewed the game for Variety, concurs. Upgrading \"your camp to tier 3 to unlock fast travel ... (is) one of the most important tips I can think of,\" he said. \"It's still limited to a pretty small number of points around the world, but it can save a lot of time at various points.\"\n\nExploring the game's impressive landscapes on horseback is a pleasure, but sometimes you want to get somewhere quickly. When your camp is upgraded, \"you can fast travel directly from the gang camp to any of the cities you\u2019ve previously visited,\" Bertz said.\n\nAlso, when upgrading the camp, make sure there's plenty of ammunition and health tonics on hand.\n\n\u2022More travel advances. If you are riding with the gang, you can have your horse automatically follow the crew. Just hold the Run button (X on PS4 or A on Xbox One) and that will pace your horse and he won't get as tired is if you were pressing the button regularly to keep up.\n\nEventually as you start making your way through the various regions, you may get tired of holding that Run button. \"Red Dead 2\" has an app to resolve that.\n\nBefore you head out on an excursion, set a waypoint on the map. Then, while you are riding your horse, engage the cinematic camera while holding the run button (X on PS4 or A on Xbox One). Once engaged, you can take your finger off the run button and just enjoy the scenery.\n\nChange camera angles back to the traditional third-person and first-person view by pressing down on the right stick.\n\nMake sure to visit train stations because you can buy a train ticket that will let you fast travel to nearby stations the train has already visited as well as any other active train station you\u2019ve been to.\n\n\u2022On the hunt. Early on in the game, you will wind up on a bear hunt with Hosea. You will encounter a Legendary Bear. Make sure to continue the hunt after you encounter the bear. This will give you an early introduction to the Trapper and net you \"an amazing cold weather hat,\" the Rockstar gurus say.\n\n\n\nAlso early in Chapter 2, you can begin bringing crafting materials to the camp's cook, Pearson, and have him make you a new satchel that holds more than your initial one.\n\nBefore you hunt, read the Compendium for useful information on where animals can be found and what ammo to use. When aiming at an animal, you'll see a star rating for that animal's pelt or carcass. Only 3-star carcasses can be used in crafting, and you must get a clean kill to have the pelt remain perfect.\n\nStudying animals will give you useful information on how to get that clean kill. Don't forget to use your binoculars to track them from a distance. For smaller animals, use the varmint rifle and small game arrows.\n\nBeyond the pelt and meat from game you kill, you can gather animal fat that can be made in crafting fire bottles (like molotov cocktails) and explosive ammunition. You can also sell the fat to butchers and trappers.\n\nAlso, you can collect bird feathers, which can also be given to the Trapper who can use them to add flair to Arthur\u2019s hat.\n\n\u2022Gunplay. Want to get some upgraded guns early in the game? When in the town of Valentine, speak to the biographer at the saloon to start the Gunslinger series of missions, \u201cThe Noblest of Men, And A Woman.\" These optional stories give you access to some incredibly customized weapons.\n\nThere will be times you face numerous enemies, so you will want to take advantage of the Dead Eye feature, says GameSpot Associate Editor Kallie Plagge, who described the game as \"emotional\" and \"thought-provoking\" in her review. \"This is the ability that slows down time during combat so you can nail precision shots on enemies,\" she said. To engage Dead Eye, while aiming at a target, you hit RB on the Xbox One controller or R3 on the PS4.\n\n\"It's a great option in situations when you're overwhelmed, since you can target multiple enemies at once and thin out the opposition,\" Plagge said. \"You'll unlock abilities like manually targeting enemies and even seeing hotspots where your shots will be the most deadly.\"\n\n\u2022Horsing around. Your horse is an important part of your success, so take time to bond. That gains you new abilities such as rearing and skidding to a stop.\n\nIn addition to feeding and brushing your horse, another easy way to bond with your horse is to click the left stick while riding to pat and calm it down. Purchasing higher-end saddles and stirrups will increase your horse's speed and acceleration.\n\n\"Feed, ride and brush your horse to bond with it; as its bond grows, you can call it from greater distances, and it learns new maneuvers like strafing,\" Plagge said. \"You can also break wild horses, raise them and sell them for a profit once they're well-trained. The trick is approaching them slowly and calmly.\"\n\nAnd since you spent so much time connecting and improving your horse, make sure to have a horse reviver tonic in your inventory, so you can heal your trusty steed.\n\n\u2022Stay focused. As you make your way through the turn-of-the-century setting, pick a task and stick to it, says Chris Plante, executive editor and co-founder of video game site Polygon.\n\nAn open-world adventure, \"Red Dead 2\" allows you to explore beyond the game's storyline to hunt, fish, collect bounties and other activities. But Plante said he enjoyed the game more \"when I focused on one activity at a time. For example, if I needed pelts to craft a fancy outfit, I went hunting with purpose, bringing the appropriate gear: bait, tonics, a rifle.\"\n\nCutting out distractions, he said, \"allowed me to get into the moment, rather than treating each activity like an obligation on the way to whatever's next.\"\n\nMore: 'Red Dead Redemption 2': First impressions from once upon a time in the West\n\nMore: 'Red Dead Redemption 2' rakes in $725M for Rockstar Games in blockbuster weekend debut\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/08/red-dead-redemption-2-six-tips-old-west-video-game-success/1822783002/", "Zurich's supporters celebrate after the Europa League Group A soccer match between Bayer 04 Leverkusen and FC Zurich in Leverkusen, Germany, Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nOlivier Giroud ended his drought by scoring the only goal to lead Chelsea to a 1-0 win at BATE Borisov on Thursday that clinched a place in the knockout stage of the Europa League with two group games to spare.\n\nGiroud had not scored for Chelsea for six months but he knows what it's like to net against BATE. Last season, the France forward was on target in both games against the Belarusian champion when he played for London rival Arsenal in Europe's second tier competition.\n\nArsenal also made it through after a 0-0 home draw against Sporting marred by Danny Welbeck's injury. The England striker was carried off on a stretcher after appearing to sustain a serious ankle problem. He needed to receive oxygen before he was taken to hospital.\n\nZurich reached the next stage, together with Bayer Leverkusen, after the German side won their encounter 1-0. Eintracht Frankfurt beat Apollon Limassol 3-2 to advance, while Lazio beat Marseille 2-1 to march into the next round and eliminate last year's runner-up.\n\nDinamo Zagreb was another team to progress to the knockout phase after the fourth round of matches. Ten-man Sevilla won 3-2 at Akhisar thanks to a late penalty, but Anderlecht's hopes of going through are over.\n\nHere's a look at Thursday's action:\n\nPERFECT CHELSEA\n\nEmerson Palmieri crossed from the left in the 53rd minute and Giroud stooped to head in for Chelsea. The France striker was playing against BATE instead of Alvaro Morata, who was rested.\n\n'I'm pleased for him,\" manager Maurizio Sarri said of Giroud. \"He's a very important player for us, very useful for the team, but I know very well that strikers want to score, and so for his confidence it's very important.\n\n\"BATE played very well. They were unlucky and could have drawn the match.\"\n\nThe win extended Chelsea's unbeaten streak this season to 17 games, but the London club was given several scares as BATE hit the woodwork three times.\n\nChelsea tops Group L with a maximum 12 points. Hungary's Vidi is second on six points after a 1-0 victory over PAOK .\n\nARSENAL HELD\n\nArsenal was held to a 0-0 home draw by Sporting, which had Jeremy Mathieu sent off for a professional foul on substitute Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang three minutes from the end.\n\nAubameyang, who replaced the injured Welbeck in the 30th minute, missed a string of scoring chances.\n\n\"Danny's looked like a serious injury, which is not nice to see,\" Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech said. \"Our thoughts are with him.\"\n\nArsenal tops Group E with 10 points, three ahead of Sporting. Qarabag joined Vorskla on three points after winning their match 1-0.\n\nBETIS ON TOP\n\nSpanish midfielder Suso curled in a free kick to salvage a 1-1 draw for seven-time European champion AC Milan at Real Betis, which had taken the lead in the 12th minute through Giovani Lo Celso.\n\nBetis tops Group F on eight points, one ahead of Milan and Olympiacos, which thrashed Dudelange 5-1.\n\nLAST-GASP SEVILLA\n\nEver Banega converted a penalty three minutes from time against Akhisar as he grabbed the winner for Sevilla, the most successful club in Europa League history.\n\nEarlier, Nolito and Luis Muriel gave the Spanish club a 2-0 lead, but Elvis Manu started a comeback for Akhisar in the 52nd, four minutes before Sergi Gomez was sent off. Onur Ayik then equalized for the Turkish side after 78.\n\nSevilla is tied atop Group J on nine points with Russia's Krasnodar, which beat Standard Liege 2-1.\n\nOTHER GROUPS\n\nTakumi Minamino's hat trick inspired Salzburg to a 5-2 win at Rosenborg, its fourth straight victory in Group B. Celtic beat Leipzig 2-1 to join the German side on six points.\n\nIn Group H, Luka Jovic, Sebastien Haller and Mijat Gacinovic scored as Eintracht made it four wins from four games. Emilio Zelaya netted twice for Apollon, the second time from the penalty spot.\n\nMarco Parolo headed the opening goal for Lazio in first-half injury time and Joaquin Correa beat goalkeeper Yohann Pele 10 minutes into the second before Marseille got one back through Florian Thauvin.\n\nEintracht has 12 points followed by Lazio on nine. Marseille and Apollon, both on one point, are out.\n\nIn Group G, Spartak Moscow beat Rangers 4-3 in a thriller after the Scottish club had led 3-2. Villarreal leads the section with six points after drawing 0-0 at Rapid Vienna. Rangers and Spartak are one point behind.\n\nAnderlecht's campaign came to an end after a 2-0 defeat at Group D rival Fenerbahce. Zagreb advanced from that section after a 3-1 victory over Spartak Trnava.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nWashington State Cougars quarterback Gardner Minshew (Photo: James Snook, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nPULLMAN, Wash. \u2013 Gardner Minshew had two very different options to consider earlier this year.\n\nOption 1: He could spend his final season of college football at defending national champion Alabama, most likely as a backup quarterback.\n\nOption 2: He could become the potential starter at Washington State, a team that was rebuilding and still grieving after the suicide of its top returning quarterback.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that hard,\u201d Minshew says of his decision now. But he didn\u2019t quite expect it to turn him into a local cult hero of sorts eight months later.\n\nThe mustachioed Minshew, a native of Mississippi, is the nation\u2019s leading passer with 391 yards a game. He\u2019s led No. 8 Washington State to an 8-1 record and an improbable run into the hunt for the College Football Playoff. And he\u2019s done it with the flair of a Burt Reynolds movie character from the 1970s, inspiring fans to copy his look by wearing sunglasses, headbands and fake hair on their upper lips.\n\nMore: USA TODAY Sports college football staff picks for Week 11\n\nMore: Mike Leach says no 'Halloween' or 'Steel Magnolias' for Washington State football team\n\nConsider:\n\n-- A Cougars gear store near campus, Crimson & Gray, is selling fake mustaches now for $2.\n\n-- In nearby Colfax, businesses are planning to give out free fake mustaches on Nov. 21 and 23. Their promotion was going to be named \u201cGardner Minshew Days\u201d until they received word that using his name would violate NCAA rules against commercial promotion of amateur athletes.\n\n-- In last week\u2019s 19-13 win against Cal, WSU coach Mike Leach noticed this craze, too.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of mustached women in the stands,\u201d Leach said.\n\nWashington State graduate Jennie Dickinson is among those sporting fake mustaches and sunglasses as the Gardner Minshew craze sweeps Pullman, Wash. (Photo: Jennie Dickinson)\n\nYet it all came pretty close to never happening, hinging on that decision by him in March, which carried considerable risk.\n\nShould he move to a campus with the lowest athletics revenue in the Pac-12 and join a team that had six assistant coaches leave in the offseason and was practically starting over? Or should he go to the most dominant program in the land, where the competition might be tougher but he also was offered a chance to join the coaching staff next year as a graduate student?\n\nAnd what if he had made the opposite choice?\n\nTwo boxes and a suitcase\n\nThe 6-foot-2 Minshew graduated from East Carolina last December with one year of college eligibility remaining. After sharing time at quarterback there in 2016 and 2017, he decided to transfer elsewhere for reasons he declined to say.\n\nAlabama soon jumped to get him, hoping to add him as an insurance policy at a position that suddenly had gotten more complicated after the national championship game in January. That\u2019s when Alabama freshman QB Tua Tagovailoa came off the bench and won the game for the Crimson Tide, displacing regular starting sophomore Jalen Hurts.\n\n\u201cI was thinking Jalen Hurts probably was going to transfer at that time,\u201d Minshew told USA TODAY after practice this week. \u201cSo I was thinking, `You know, you\u2019ve got a freshman who\u2019s played not a full game of football.\u2019 As a competitor, I was going to take my chance.\u201d\n\nHe committed to the Crimson Tide in February. Shortly afterward, he got a call from Leach, who offered him what his \u201cAir Raid\u201d offense always can offer quarterback recruits \u2013 a chance to throw the ball around 50 times a game.\n\nLeach also was starting over with a group of quarterbacks who hadn't thrown a single pass in a major college game. Last year\u2019s starting quarterback, Luke Falk, ranked 12th nationally in passing yards per game before moving on to a shot in the NFL. His backup, Tyler Hilinski, fatally shot himself in an apartment near campus in January, leaving the team reeling.\n\nIn stepped Minshew, who moved here in May with \u201ctwo boxes and a suitcase\u201d after a cross-country drive with his father.\n\n\u201cI was super grateful for everything (Alabama) Coach (Nick) Saban was offering, but this was a dream come true, really,\u201d Minshew said.\n\nA big reason for that is what might come next, because of how he\u2019s playing this year \u2013 a chance to play in the NFL.\n\nIf he had stuck with Alabama, he\u2019d have to compete for time with Hurts and Tagovailoa, this year\u2019s favorite to win the Heisman Trophy, according to the USA TODAY Network Heisman survey.\n\nMinshew is fourth. If he hadn\u2019t come to WSU, he might not have played again. The Cougars also might not be where they are now, closing in on their first league title since 2002, less than a year Leach nearly left to coach Tennessee.\n\nSmokey and the Bandit\n\nThe six assistants who did depart WSU after last season all left for where the grass looked greener: Ohio State, UCLA, Oregon, Texas Tech and the Chicago Bears. All have more resources than WSU, which ranked last in the Pac-12 in athletics revenue in 2016-17 ($64 million) and is 250 miles from Seattle, the nearest big city.\n\nBy comparison, Alabama had revenue of $174 million.\n\n\u201cWe were kind of unsure of what the season would look like because we had lost so many faces,\u201d said Nick Begg, a senior defensive lineman.\n\nBut this is why WSU is paying Leach $3.5 million this year \u2013 to win despite those disadvantages. His Air Raid system is designed to exploit inefficiencies on the field, spreading the field horizontally and vertically to stretch the defense and create space for ball carriers.\n\nMinshew has mastered it at times, becoming a machine of short, quick throws that can wear out opponents. He leads all Power 5 conference quarterbacks with the highest percentage of passing attempts that have traveled five or fewer yards past the line of scrimmage (60.3%), not including yards gained after a catch, according to STATS, a sports data company.\n\nHe\u2019s also led his team on three game-winning drives in the fourth quarter to add extra magic to this season, which included a raucous crowd on campus last month for ESPN\u2019s College GameDay. Three wins in their final three regular-season games would give the Cougars their first 11-win season ever. On Saturday, they start going for it at Colorado (5-4).\n\n\u201cHow the soup came together is pretty amazing,\u201d WSU athletic director Pat Chun said Wednesday.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than Minshew. His blockers are keeping him upright, ranking fifth nationally with only seven sacks allowed in nine games. But he\u2019s the one stirring the bowl, on the field and off, where his moxie in both places sort of reminds Leach of the 1977 movie Smokey and the Bandit.\n\nIn that film, actor Burt Reynolds played the mustachioed Southern trucker who eluded his pursuers with a showboating style that was fast and fun. In the current drama at WSU, Minshew said he didn\u2019t start growing his own mustache until August. Then came more wins and more fans, who latched onto it as a symbol of the season.\n\n\u201cI try to keep it light, try to keep it fun,\u201d Minshew said. \u201cI think they just kind of respond to that, and it\u2019s been pretty awesome.\u201d\n\nFollow sports reporter Brent Schrotenboer on Twitter @Schrotenboer.

USA TODAY\n\nDemonstrators call for the protection of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program outside the office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., in Los Angeles in January. (Photo: Reed Saxon, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that President Donald Trump cannot end an Obama administration program that protects undocumented immigrants brought to the USA as children.\n\nA panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit agreed with a federal district judge's decision in January that Trump lacked the authority to eliminate the program \u2013 a proposal the president made last year in hopes of prodding Congress to act.\n\n\"Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the rescission of DACA \u2013 at least as justified on this record \u2013 is arbitrary, capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law,\" the three-member panel said.\n\n\"In a world where the government can remove only a small percentage of the undocumented noncitizens present in this country in any year,\" the panel said, DACA lets it \"devote much-needed resources to enforcement priorities such as threats to national security, rather than blameless and economically productive young people with clean criminal records.\"\n\nThe decision leaves in place for now the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, which has protected more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants from deportation and enabled them to get work permits.\n\nThe court noted it was created because of the \"cruelty and wastefulness of deporting productive young people to countries with which they have no ties.\"\n\nThe Justice Department is likely to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, which has five reliably conservative justices. In February, the high court refused to leapfrog the appeals court's review of Judge William Alsup's decision.\n\n\u201cIn California and across our nation, Dreamers significantly enrich our communities as scholars, entrepreneurs, first responders and much more,\" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said. \"This fight, of course, is far from over. We will continue to defend Dreamers and DACA all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary.\u201d\n\nDan Stein, president of the conservative Federation for American Immigration Reform, decried the ruling. \"The Supreme Court must move this case to the top of their docket,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo other federal appeals courts are reviewing the dispute between the Trump administration and the states, local governments and immigrant rights groups fighting to maintain the program.\n\nSanaa Abrar, advocacy director for United We Dream, a youth-led immigration advocacy group, predicted those rulings would come to the same conclusion.\n\n\"Another federal court has said what we've always known: that Trump's decision to kill DACA was wrong and that his sole motivation was to deport 800,000 people of color,\" Abrar said in a statement.\n\nThe opinion strikes down an argument often made by the Trump administration: that DACA was an unconstitutional \"end run\" around Congress, which has repeatedly blocked the DREAM Act. The measure was introduced in 2001 but never has passed both chambers.\n\nThe case to save DACA was initiated by the University of California, which issued a statement urging the Trump administration to drop its effort to rescind the program and asking Congress to enact permanent protections.\n\n\"While today\u2019s ruling is welcome news, we stress that DACA recipients deserve better than to see their life prospects rise and fall based on events in litigation,\" the university statement said.\n\nIn its ruling, the 9th Circuit pointed out that the two policies provide very different forms of relief. DACA grants protection from deportation; the DREAM Act would confer legal permanent residency, which leads toward U.S. citizenship.\n\nTo reach its conclusion, the 9th Circuit decision explored more than 100 years of presidential administrations deciding that not every law must be enforced 100 percent of the time and that not all people should be punished for every violation.\n\nThe opinion cited President Ronald Reagan\u2019s decision to protect relatives of undocumented immigrants who were granted amnesty in 1986 and President Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s decision to protect more than 30,000 Hungarian refugees in 1956. It found 19 other examples of large groups of foreigners protected from deportation.\n\nThe court even cited the case of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who were nearly deported over a marijuana possession charge in Britain but were allowed to remain in the USA because they were not priorities for deportation.\n\nMore: What Democratic takeover of House means for Trump\u2019s immigration agenda\n\nMore: Immigrant caravan reaches Mexico City, pauses to regroup\n\nMore: Trump calls for new limits on seeking asylum claims as he pushes immigration issue before midterms\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/08/daca-federal-appeals-court-blocks-trump-administration-ending-program/1931643002/", "Oklahoma State (5-4, 2-4 Big 12) at No. 6 Oklahoma (8-1, 5-1, No. 6 CFP), 3:30 p.m. EST (ABC)\n\nLine: Oklahoma by 20\u00bd.\n\nSeries record: Oklahoma leads 87-18-7.\n\nWHAT'S AT STAKE?\n\nOklahoma needs a win to stay within reach of a spot in the College Football Playoff.

That\u2019s the exact demographic that the upscale market \u2013 which describes itself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Healthiest Grocery Store\u201d \u2013 caters to.\n\nAs of Thursday, in the 37 GOP districts where Democrats flipped a seat or were leading, 70 percent contain a Whole Foods Market, according to Dave Wasserman, the U.S. House editor at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. In districts where Republicans held on or were leading, just 39 percent had one.\n\n\"Whole Foods locates its stores, in part, based on educational attainment data. They locate their stores in areas with high levels of college graduates. And that\u2019s a good proxy for the places where Democrats are gaining vote share in the Trump era,\u201d Wasserman said.\n\nHouse Republicans ran hard on the strong economy and low employment. But USA TODAY's analysis indicates it was actually Democrats who performed well in areas that have benefited from the booming economy \u2013 areas like the suburbs of Los Angeles, Kansas City, Dallas, Minneapolis and Atlanta.\n\nMeanwhile Democrats continued to flounder in rural areas \u2013 where the president tends to be more popular \u2013 managing to flip just five districts that are 25 percent rural or more.\n\n\"Democrats\u2019 blue wave in the House was powered by Whole Foods districts,\" Wasserman said.

(AP) \u2014 The UAB football program has been better than ever since its resurrection.\n\nThe Blazers (8-1, 6-0 Conference USA) enter Saturday's home finale against Southern Miss with a chance to claim a berth in the league title game in just the second season since the program's resurrection following a university-ordered shutdown. UAB is the home of the nation's top scoring defense.\n\nA 16-6 record on the comeback trail exceeds even coach Bill Clark's expectations.\n\n\"I think in my wildest dreams, it would be something like this,\" Clark said.\n\nThis could wind up being the Blazers' best season. The 1993 team posted the program's best record, 9-2 as a Division I-AA (now FCS) independent.\n\nWhat's more impressive is how UAB got to this point.\n\nThe program was shut down, along with rifle and bowling, in a drastic cost-cutting measure after the 2014 season \u2014 Clark's first \u2014 even though the Blazers had become bowl eligible for the first time in a decade.\n\nResurrected after six months and an outpouring of community and financial support, UAB went 8-5 last season after the program's return while luxuriating in new facilities that represent a huge upgrade from the old high school-like digs. The reward for players \u2014 and Clark \u2014 who stuck around was an expenses-paid trip to the Bahamas Bowl.\n\nThe prize this season could ultimately be a conference title shot and perhaps a national ranking.\n\nUAB, whose only ranking came at No. 24 for one week in 2004, received the 30th-most votes in the latest AP Top 25. It might not be much to the juggernaut down the road, No. 1 Alabama, but for the Blazers it's a sign that national respect is growing.\n\nThey're not just a feel-good story any more. They're a pretty good team.\n\nThe first task was proving that locally.\n\n\"When I first showed up at the end of August in 2016, you really didn't hear much about UAB,\" guard Malique Johnson said. \"You didn't see much UAB anything around here. All you saw was the Tide or whatever. Now, you go into Wal-Mart and you're starting to see banners and posters and everything.\n\n\"We're not there yet, but we're starting to get the respect we deserve.\"\n\nUAB has won a school-record seven straight since a 47-24 loss at Coastal Carolina in Week 2. The Blazers have allowed just 62 points in the other eight games combined.\n\nThey're allowing a nation's best 12.1 points per game while holding CUSA opponents to about half that on average. UAB is the first Conference USA team to record three shutouts in a season.\n\nNot to be outdone, UAB's offense set school records last weekend with 668 total yards and 419 rushing yards in a 52-3 win over UTSA . The Blazers did it with backup quarterback Tyler Johnston III, Alabama's Mr. Football in 2015, making his first start in place of an injured A.J. Erdely.\n\nClark hasn't indicated who will start against Southern Miss.\n\nUAB's success might make Clark a commodity for bigger programs seeking head coaches, though he says he's happy at UAB and focused on his team.\n\nIn the meantime, he's got the added pressure of trying to keep making sure the UAB supporters who helped bring the program back don't get buyer's remorse from the on-field product.\n\n\"I put a lot of pressure on myself,\" Clark, a coach's son, said. \"That's not really a fun world to live in, but it's really the only way I know how to do it because I know what comes with wins and I know what comes with losses.\n\n\"I felt a lot of pressure this year to (show), it wasn't a fluke.

(AP) \u2014 This wasn't what North Carolina coach Larry Fedora had envisioned for his seventh season.\n\nThings started badly with 13 players facing suspensions for selling team-issued shoes , which followed Fedora's much-criticized comments on football's ties to the degenerative brain disease CTE. Now the one-win Tar Heels are hurtling toward a second straight bowl-less finish and finding ways to lose close games, a stark turn in the program's direction since winning an Atlantic Coast Conference division championship in 2015.\n\n\"There's not a fan that sits in the seats or on a message board or anything out there that wants it worse than these kids want it or that are working harder than these kids to make it happen,\" Fedora said. \"My job is to put them in a position so that they can do that, and I haven't done that yet.\"\n\nUNC tied a program record with 11 wins in 2015, won the Coastal Division and reached No. 8 in the Top 25. But after an 18-5 stretch with a 13-2 record against league teams, the Tar Heels (1-7, 1-5) have lost 19 of 24 overall and 14 of 16 in the ACC since November 2016 entering Saturday's trip to rival Duke.\n\nThe list includes a mistake-filled home loss to Virginia Tech after surrendering the winning touchdown with 19 seconds left on a 98-yard drive. There was a double-overtime loss at No. 13 Syracuse. And the Tar Heels rallied from 18 down in the third quarter to tie Georgia Tech in the fourth, only to commit two turnovers that propelled the Yellow Jackets to the win .\n\nThat's all in the past month, too.\n\nThe problems include shaky quarterback play for the second straight year. There's another growing list of injuries, including season-ending wrist surgery for sophomore quarterback Chazz Surratt and two freshman QBs who went down during gameday auditions to replace seven-game starter Nathan Elliott. The Tar Heels also rank among the Bowl Subdivision's worst in turnover margin.\n\nThat's hampered the staple of Fedora's tenure: a high-powered offense that provided plenty of cover for mistakes. The Tar Heels averaged 35.9 points and 453.4 yards through his first five seasons, but have slid to 25.1 points and 384 yards over 2017 and 2018.\n\n\"Our margin for error is so small right now that every mistake that's made is magnified in everything we do,\" Fedora said.\n\nAt least effort hasn't been a problem, with Fedora noting: \"I've told them I can't ask them to work any harder.\"\n\n\"I think our team has done actually a good job of just moving on to the next week, not losing hope \u2014 just coming out and grinding every single day,\" offensive tackle Charlie Heck said.\n\nDuke coach David Cutcliffe said his team knows to expect a tough game regardless of UNC's record.\n\n\"Watching tape of this team and previous North Carolina teams, this is a well, well-coached football team, a talented football team that's had some misfortune,\" Cutcliffe said. \"But on tape they're a good football team.\"\n\nIt was in this game two years ago that UNC's slide began, even if then it seemed like merely one bad night.\n\nLed by No. 2 overall NFL draft pick Mitch Trubisky at quarterback, the 15th-ranked Tar Heels went to Durham to face the winless-in-the-ACC Blue Devils. Yet UNC's offense sputtered after halftime \u2014 foreshadowing current problems \u2014 in the 28-27 loss .\n\nFedora has pointed to turnovers as the slide's top cause, though there are several factors.\n\nThere has been significant coaching turnover, notably with the departures of strong coordinators when Seth Littrell (offense) left in December 2015 to become North Texas' head coach and Gene Chizik (defense) leaving coaching in early 2017. Trubisky left a year early after his rapid ascent as a pro prospect, leaving QB questions the Tar Heels have yet to reliably answer.\n\nFedora agreed to a new contract after the 2015 division title. That deal runs through the 2022 season, and a coaching change could cost UNC more than $12 million.\n\nFor now, Fedora is consumed with helping his players find the winning play or two that has eluded them.\n\n\"They know it's coming \u2014 they do,\" Fedora said. \"Their effort has been unbelievable. Their fight, their will to win, all of those things are there. You can see it in their eyes.

I would tell you to stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one, but there\u2019s no point; I know you have. This time, tragedy struck a crowded country dance bar in Thousand Oaks, California.\n\nThis country's streets have become a war zone, and the list of communities reeling from gun violence gets longer every day. Communities like mine. On June 12, 2016, Orlando was the headline. And though it has been over two years since that night, the trauma feels fresh on days like this one when a gunman opened fire for almost three minutes.\n\nIn the eyes of the survivors, I see the same fear I felt as I crouched on the floor of a bathroom at Pulse Nightclub. In their stories, I hear the same gunshots and screams. And as mothers and survivors beg for information on their loved ones, I am brought back to the moment I learned that nine rounds from an assault rifle ended my best friend\u2019s life on the dance floor.\n\nMy heart breaks for the people of Thousand Oaks.

How many times have our neighbors been gunned down only for us to change the channel? It seems we\u2019ve already forgotten about the yoga studio shooting in Tallahassee, the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh or the high school shooting in Parkland \u2014 which all happened this year and were the topic of national conversation.\n\nHow often do we say \u201cit could never happen here\u201d until it\u2019s too late and we\u2019re burying the ones we love?

Jones, AP)\n\nATLANTA \u2014 Republican Brian Kemp has resigned as Georgia secretary of state after declaring victory in the race for governor over Democrat Stacey Abrams.\n\nThe secretary of state's office issued a statement saying Kemp's resignation was effective at 11:59 a.m. Thursday.\n\nHis departure comes as Abrams refuses to concede until every vote is counted, including about 22,000 outstanding provisional ballots.\n\nAbrams campaign says that it's too soon for Kemp to declare victory and that it is taking legal action to \"ensure that every single vote cast by Georgia\u2019s citizens is counted.\"\n\n\"We know our opponent has had the secretary of state's office declare he is the winner. We are here to say we don't accept that,\" said Lauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams' campaign manager.\n\nAbrams' legal team announced at a press conference Thursday that it was filing a lawsuit against Dougherty County election officials requesting that late absentee ballots still be counted.\n\nKurt Kastorf, a member of the legal team, said a large number of voters requested mail ballots that were delayed because of an issue with the ballots themselves and then Hurricane Michael. Kastorf said many Dougherty County voters were not given enough time to review, complete and submit their ballots.\n\nAttorneys for Abrams also claim there are hundreds of Georgia voters who cast absentee ballots, including several college students, but there is no confirmation of it being received or counted on the state's website.\n\nRobyn A. Crittenden was appointed to serve as interim Georgia secretary of state.\n\n\"We deeply appreciate Brian Kemp\u2019s public service as secretary of state,\" Lorri Smith, assistant deputy secretary of state, said in a statement. \"We will continue our work in this office on behalf of all Georgians.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Kemp campaign said that with Kemp ahead 64,000 votes, outstanding provisional and overseas ballots would not make a difference.\n\n\u201cSimply put, it is mathematically impossible for Stacey Abrams to win or force a runoff election,\u201d Kemp spokesman Cody Hall said in a statement. \"Peach State voters made a clear decision at the ballot box\n\nKemp supporters have started celebrating on social media, including Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal who posted a tweeted saying: \"My congratulations to Gov.-elect @BrianKempGA. He and his opponent both ran passionate campaigns with very different visions about how to keep Georgia on this path of prosperity, and I believe the voters of Georgia made the correct decision in electing Brian.\"\n\nCritics have been calling on Kemp to resign for months, saying his position as state elections chief was a conflict of interest with his candidacy.\n\nNAACP President Derrick Johnson released a statement Thursday saying it was \"unfortunate\" that Kemp didn't step down months ago to ensure a fair election.\n\n\"Whether it\u2019s malicious intent or benign neglect, Kemp\u2019s actions during the election were textbook voter suppression and surely decreased voter confidence among residents in the state,\" Johnson said. \"His actions were strategic, careless and aimed at silencing the voting power of communities of color in the state, and although his resignation comes at an interesting time, amidst a recount of the gubernatorial race, the NAACP will be closely watching how these events unfold.\u201d\n\nGroh-Wargo said the Abrams campaign was blindsided by Kemp's claim of victory, saying there are at least 25,000 provisional and mail-in ballots that remain uncounted.\n\nShe said they were unsure of how many absentee ballots remain, but the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office said Wednesday afternoon that fewer than 3,000 \u201cnon-provisional\u201d ballots were outstanding.\n\nClarke, Fulton, Hall and Gwinnett counties completed their absentee ballot tabulations Wednesday. Cobb and Chatham were expected to also finish their counts by the end of Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the statement, county officials reported fewer than 22,000 provisional ballots cast statewide.\n\nAbrams campaign said an additional 23,783 votes would push the race into recount threshold, and 25,632 more votes would force the race into a runoff.\n\nProvisional ballots must be verified by Friday.

USA TODAY\n\nSigns of Red Sox players after winning the World Series. (Photo: Paul Rutherford, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nBill James\u2019 contributions to baseball are significant, meritorious and possibly unmatched by any within the industry in the last 40 years.\n\nYet he, of all people, should know that great baseball players \u2013 of sound mind, athletic body and full heart \u2013 are not merely replaceable units.\n\nJames, among the godfathers of this all-encompassing and still vastly understood movement known as \u201canalytics,\u201d holds among many titles that of Senior Advisor, Baseball Operations, Boston Red Sox. Given his lifetime of pragmatic and sober analysis, you\u2019d think James would be too wise to engage in an odious Twitter beef about baseball, economics and fungibility.\n\nGiven for whom he consults, you\u2019d think he\u2019d be wise enough not to tweet this: \u201cIf the players all retired tomorrow, we would replace them, the game would go on; in three years it would make no difference whatsoever. The players are NOT the game, any more than the beer vendors are.\u201d\n\nLest we forget, the champagne\u2019s barely dry from the Red Sox\u2019s fourth title this century, won last month by a dedicated group of players that represented all corners of the baseball landscape, artfully constructed in recent months and years by club president Dave Dombrowski, his staff and those who preceded them.\n\nMORE MLB\n\nThere was a boatload of homegrown stars drafted or signed internationally and developed in the system: Mookie Betts, Jackie Bradley Jr., Xander Bogaerts, Andrew Benintendi, Rafael Devers.\n\nThere was a menagerie of useful veteran parts accumulated through trades over time: Brock Holt, Steve Pearce, Ian Kinsler, Joe Kelly.\n\nAnd of course, a chunk of players acquired or retained in some part due to the Red Sox\u2019s wealth: David Price, Chris Sale, Rick Porcello, Craig Kimbrel, J.D. Martinez.\n\nAh, yes, Martinez.\n\nSomehow, the Red Sox were the lone serious bidders for his services after last season, and he ultimately \u201csettled\u201d for their $110 million deal just as spring training opened. The nouveau conventional wisdom suggested that after a season in which a major league record 6,104 home runs were struck, paying big money for a power hitter was, well, inefficient.\n\nUndeterred by this logic, Martinez went out and proved himself a veritable bargain: 43 home runs, 130 runs batted in, an AL-best 358 total bases, and, in James\u2019 language, was worth at least 6 wins by any WAR-time measure. In his first playoff at-bat with Boston, he crushed a three-run homer that kick-started the Red Sox\u2019s four-game conquest of the mighty Yankees in the AL Division Series.\n\nOf course, Martinez is a living, breathing human, one who happens to take the art of hitting seriously. His daily contributions to the Red Sox began not at 7:05 p.m., but far earlier in the afternoon, spreading his hitting gospel throughout the squad.\n\nBetts jacked up his batting average from .264 to a major league-best .346 and is a shoo-in for AL MVP. Martinez's tutelage is, according to assistant hitting coach Andy Barkett, the main reason why.\n\nGold Glove center fielder Jackie Bradley Jr. boosted the exit velocity on his swings significantly this season, ranking 19th in the major leagues, and went on to win ALCS MVP for his bat, not his glove.\n\nMartinez, he said, can take all the credit.\n\n\u201cOne hundred percent,\u201d Bradley told USA TODAY Sports before the World Series. \u201cIt\u2019s been something that\u2019s not only helped me, but a lot of us.\u201d\n\nSo, is Martinez replaceable? On the field, not by 99% of players walking this earth. Off the field? Not at all.\n\nThe Red Sox issued a statement early Thursday afternoon in an effort to distance themselves from James, who the team was quick to point out is a consultant and not a paid member of the executive staff.\n\nIt reads in part:\n\n\" ... His comments ... do not reflect the opinions of the Red Sox front office or its ownership group. Our Championships would not have been possible without our incredibly talented players - they are the backbone of our franchise and our industry. To insinuate otherwise is absurd.\"\n\nOf course, the game\u2019s collective mindset has been drifting James\u2019 way for nearly 20 years. Players are no longer merely players \u2013 they are \u201cassets,\u201d valued as much for their \u201ccontrollable years\u201d as their actual on-field performances.\n\nTo a degree, this approach can work on the field. The Tampa Bay Rays have churned through 139 players in their past four seasons and this year, homogenized the vast majority of their pitching staff with a radical pitching approach that thrilled the game\u2019s progressive wing while horrifying players who saw their earning power threatened.\n\nThey won 90 games.\n\nBut the real knife twist in all this is that the desire for \"efficiency\" was once bandied about only in front offices, where the goal of extracting production as cheaply as possible out of athletes has now been strangely romanticized.\n\nBlame Moneyball for this if you must, or the fact that anyone can play armchair GM, but a large segment of fanhood does seem to glean greater joy out of bloodless transactions than actual results.\n\nThe players have sensed this for years, yet another enemy of their livelihood emerging to join forces with owners in suppressing their share of some $11 billion circulating through the industry.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing for a fan to yell \u2013 or tweet \u2013 at an athlete for \u201ckilling my fantasy team.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s quite another to say that the living, breathing thing beneath the uniform \u2013 brought up to believe that the human connection between fan and athlete actually matters \u2013 is as disposable as the nacho cheese in the concession stands.\n\nThese humans responded in kind on Thursday.

One proposal would be banning flavoring of e-cigarette liquids. USA TODAY\n\n(FILES) In this file photo taken on April 18, 2016 smoked cigarettes are seen in an ashtray in Centreville, Virginia. (Photo: PAUL J. RICHARDS, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nCigarette smoking has reached the lowest level ever recorded among U.S. adults \u2013 and the youth smoking rate dropped even farther, the federal government reported Thursday.\n\nAbout 14 percent of U.S. adults, or 34 million people, smoked cigarettes everyday or some days in the previous month, down from 15.5 percent in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Cancer Institute. The new rate represents a 67 percent decline since 1965.\n\nAbout 10 percent of people aged 18 to 24 years smoked cigarettes in 2017, down from 13 percent in 2016.\n\nThat would be heralded as a public health success if so many young people weren't become addicted to nicotine through electronic cigarettes, or vaping.\n\nNicotine use overall reflects this: About 20 percent of U.S. adults used a tobacco product last year, through e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco, cigarettes, cigars and hookah.\n\nCigarette smoking is the top preventable cause of death and disease in the United States, and is the biggest tobacco-related health problem.\n\nAbout 16 million Americans have a smoking-related illness, and about 480,000 die each year. Eliminating smoking in America would eventually eliminate about a third of all cancer deaths, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nDavid Ashley, a former official of the FDA and CDC, says the new numbers suggest \"tobacco control efforts are still on the right track.\"\n\nBut smoking still has a strong grip on the disadvantaged and other groups, federal data show. More than 40 percent of adults who reported \"serious psychological distress\" used tobacco. About 27 percent in the LGBTQ community reported tobacco use.\n\n\u201cThe persistent disparities in adult smoking prevalence described in this report emphasize the need for further research to accelerate reductions in tobacco use among all Americans,\" says Dr. Norman Sharpless, director of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nFormer FDA and CDC official David Ashley, a professor at Georgia State University\u2019s School of Public Health, right, is shown on a teen vaping panel Nov. 1, 2018, sponsored by the advocacy group Truth Initiative.

She is a substance abuse counselor for Arlington Public Schools, and to her right is Cornell University student Jack Waxman, who started a group opposed to vaping at his school. (Photo: Davon Harris)\n\nVaping was supposed to help smokers transition away from cancer-causing tobacco, and so reduce the smoking rate. Vapers use e-cigarettes to inhale water vapor that contains nicotine.\n\nBut the practice has also drawn alarming numbers of non-smoking teens.\n\nFDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb has said preliminary government data show teen vaping has reached \"epidemic\" levels.\n\nHe said in September that his agency would demand the major e-cigarette manufacturers prove they are doing enough to keep them out of the hands of children and teens.\n\nHe has threatened to halt sales by manufacturers who fail to comply. An announcement is expected in mid-November.\n\nAshley, now a professor at the Georgia State University School of Public Health, says data show that more than 80 percent of smokers who take up e-cigarettes don\u2019t use them regularly.\n\nThese smokers either reject vaping and return to smoking exclusively or use both traditional and e-cigarettes \u2013 which dramatically reduces the benefits, Ashley says.\n\nHe says current trends raise \"serious concerns.\"\n\n\"Whether vaping will help reduce or will increase smoking from a population health standpoint is still to be determined,\" he says. \"More needs to be done to reduce the addictiveness of cigarettes and increase the effectiveness of e-cigarettes for helping smokers switch completely to achieve a more substantial public health benefit.\"\n\nIf you are interested in connecting with people online who have overcome or are currently struggling with health problems mentioned in this story, join USA TODAY\u2019s \u2018I Survived It\u2019 Facebook support group.\n\nCLOSE The JUUL vaporizer have become very popular with kids.

The Fighting Irish were 1-2 last November after reaching No. 3 in the rankings and are 18-14 in their previous eight Novembers under coach Brian Kelly.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nReconstructed Irish offensive line anchored by grad center Sam Mustipher vs. Seminoles defense led by junior end Brian Burns. Though averaging 181 yards rushing (53rd nationally) per game, the Irish have been inconsistent of late on the ground.

USA TODAY\n\nPortrait of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2009. (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg, the eldest current Supreme Court justice at 85, is known as a fierce advocate of equal pay and leader of the court's liberal wing.\n\nAfter 25 years on the court, the 85-year-old has also become an icon revered among progressives. Earlier this year, Ginsburg said she planned to stay on the bench for at least five more years.\n\nHere are just a few things to know about the justice known simply as RBG:\n\nEarly life\n\nRuth Joan Bader was born March 15, 1933, in Brooklyn, New York. She earned her bachelor's degree in government from Cornell University in 1954 and went on to graduate from Columbia Law School.\n\nFamily\n\nShe took on her now-legendary Ginsburg name after marrying Martin David Ginsburg on June 23, 1954. Her daughter, Jane, was born 14 months before Ginsburg started law school. Her son, James, was born a decade later.\n\nHer husband died in 2010.\n\nAdvocate for women's rights\n\nGinsburg joined an equal pay campaign in 1963 after realizing her salary was lower than her male colleagues at Rutgers Law School in the 1960s. In the 1970s, Ginsburg worked for the American Civil Liberties Union and co-founded the Women\u2019s Rights Project.\n\nShe's handled sex discrimination complaints, supported the Equal Rights Amendment and found success with gender discrimination litigation.\n\nIn 2016, Ginsburg published a collection of her speeches and writings dating back to the eighth grade, titled \"My Own Words,\" that paints a picture of the women's rights crusader. One part recounts her effort to keep alive a female captain's lawsuit in 1972 after the Air Force withdrew its demand that she have an abortion or resign.\n\nRecently, Ginsburg spoke about the #MeToo movement to address sexual assault and harassment, saying, \"my hope is not just that it is here to stay but that it is as effective for the woman who works as a maid in a hotel as it is for Hollywood stars.\"\n\nJoined the court\n\nIn 1980, she was appointed by former president Jimmy Carter to the U.S. Court of Appeals. In 1993, President Bill Clinton appointed her to the Supreme Court.\n\nBeat cancer \u2013 twice\n\nIn 1999 and 2000, Ginsburg underwent surgery and chemotherapy for colon cancer. In 2009, she underwent surgery and treatment for the early stages of pancreatic cancer. Now, Ginsburg is known for her health routine that includes frequent gym visits and push ups. In March, she fended off rumors of retirement by saying she's \"feeling fine.\"\n\n'Notorious RBG'\n\nIn recent years, Ginsburg has become a celebrity among progressives. She also was the subject of a documentary, \"RBG.\" Her biography is the subject of an upcoming feature film, \"On the Basis of Sex,\" in which she is played by actress Felicity Jones. Ginsburg was named one of Forbes Magazine's 100 Most Powerful Women from 2004 through 2011.\n\nMore: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hospitalized after fall in her office\n\nSources: ACLU, Supreme Court History.

(Photo: NOAH BERGER, AP)\n\nA pair of fast-growing wildfires are raging in California, forcing tens of thousands of residents from their homes and burning some 30,000 acres across the northern and southern parts of the state.\n\nThe Camp Fire, about 90 miles north of Sacramento in Butte County, has scorched over 31 square miles in Butte County, Cal Fire said in its 7 p.m. PST update. Officials said 15,000 structures are being threatened as 2,289 fire personnel work against the flames.\n\nIn Southern California, the Hill Fire had charred 15 square miles, Cal Fire said Thursday night. Spurred by strong Santa Ana winds, the Hill Fire flared amid red-flag warnings near Thousand Oaks, which was already reeling after a late-night shooting at a dance bar left 13 people dead, including the suspected gunman.\n\nNo injuries or structure losses have been reported, the Ventura County Fire Department said during a Thursday night press conference.

We have seen a sustained rapid fire growth all day today,\u201d Lareau told the Redding Record Searchlight of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until two days after it started that the Carr Fire started blowing up.\n\n\u201cThe Carr Fire on the day of its rapid expansion into northwest Redding was somewhat wind-driven and moved about six miles in the same amount of time the Camp Fire moved in 11 hours,\u201d Lareau said.\n\nThe intense winds driving the Camp Fire are much of the same conditions that fueled the Wine Country fires that ripped through Napa and Sonoma counties in October 2017, Lareau said.\n\nThe 40 to 50 mph gusts are not atypical for this time of year in California.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s atypical are the extreme dry fuels for this late in the season,\u201d Lareau said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten a good soaking of rain across Northern California.\u201d\n\nA few thousand structures were destroyed in the city of Paradise, about 180 miles northeast of San Francisco, Cal Fire Capt.

(AP Photo/Chuck Burton) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSyracuse quarterback Eric Dungey has never played in the final home game of a season. At long last he has that chance.\n\nAnd rest assured that when the No. 13 Orange (7-2, 4-2 Atlantic Coast Conference, No. 13 CFP) take the Carrier Dome field on Friday night to face struggling Louisville (2-7, 0-6) the senior star will appreciate the moment.\n\n\"I think it's going to be an emotional night, definitely, with all that I've been through here,\" said Dungey, who missed the final three games of each of his first three seasons with injuries. \"I'm just thankful for everything. It's going to be overwhelming with the emotions.\"\n\nThe home finale will be emotional for the senior class that helped third-year coach Dino Babers turn the team into a contender similar to the time Donovan McNabb was working his magic in the late 1990s. The Orange are 5-0 in the Carrier Dome this fall and are seeking just their fourth perfect season inside since the facility that opened in 1980.\n\n\"I really do hope the fans understand how emotional this game is,\" Babers said. \"It's just one of those things that you're going to always remember. If they can put that in their hearts and minds, just come out to say goodbye to this senior class that has really put us back on the right road, given us an opportunity to change this program, I mean, my heart would go out to them. I think those young men deserve it.\"\n\nIt's the final road game of the year for Louisville and embattled coach Bobby Petrino, whose squad has lost six straight and is coming off a 77-16 beat-down at No. 2 Clemson . The Tigers racked up 661 yards offensively, 492 of it on the ground. Now the Cardinals face a team that's won three straight, is averaging 43 points a game, and is nationally on the rise.\n\n\"We haven't had a season like this before,\" Petrino said. \"It's a challenge to everybody. It's difficult to prepare, go out and play hard, not win. It's hard on our players, hard on our coaches, hard on our families.\"\n\nAfter Friday night, the Orange will play No. 3 Notre Dame at Yankee Stadium and No. 17 Boston College on the road, two more opportunities to keep rising and put those tough road losses to Clemson and Pittsburgh behind them.\n\n\"The sky's the limit to me. There's no telling what we can accomplish,\" senior linebacker Ryan Guthrie said. \"There's always the what-if conversations, but we're looking forward. We've got a lot to look forward to.\"\n\nOther things to know when Louisville visits Syracuse on Friday night:\n\nWARY ORANGE\n\nThe Cardinals are winless on the road, rank 117th in the nation in scoring (21.6), 112th in total offense (344.7 ypg), and 115th in total defense (462.8). They also have won all four meetings against the Orange since joining the ACC.\n\n\"We're not taking Louisville lightly,\" Dungey said. \"People are talking about, 'Oh, Louisville's not that great this year.' I don't think that's true at all. They've got a lot of great athletes, a lot of experience as well, and I think they're hungry for a win. We were that team once, where nobody respected us.\"\n\nWALK THIS WAY\n\nBabers is feting his seniors with a treat for the second year in a row. After the game, he will take the team into the locker room and five minutes later will bring the seniors back out to mingle with the fans one last time. Babers was hopeful senior DB Tyrone Perkins would make the trip. Perkins has been recovering in North Carolina from a serious leg injury suffered in last week's win at Wake Forest .\n\nRETURN SPECIALIST\n\nLouisville freshman Hassan Hall has shown flashes of potential at running back but clearly has carved a place returning kicks. He had a 93-yard touchdown at Clemson \u2014 the Cardinals' first in three years \u2014 and established a school record with 247 return yards and 273 all-purpose. He leads the team with 999 all-purpose yards.\n\nLATE BLOOMER\n\nLouisville sophomore WR Dez Fitzpatrick has 22 receptions for 290 yards and a pair of touchdowns in the past six games. That's a 13.2-yard average, and he's second on the team in receiving with 27 catches for 351 yards.\n\nLIKE OLD TIMES\n\nSyracuse's No. 13 ranking is its highest in the AP poll since the Orange were No. 11 on Sept. 28, 1998. That was McNabb's final season, and he went out in style in his last home game, rushing for three TDs and throwing for two more in a 66-13 triumph over Miami. McNabb and Dungey are the only QBs in school history to pass for over 8,000 yards and rush for more than 1,000.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Gary Graves in Louisville, Kentucky, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Boca Juniors will face Play River Plate for the Copa Libertadores final match. (AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 They're calling it \"The Game of the Century\" and \"The Final of all Soccer Finals.\" They're not wrong.\n\nThink Celtics vs. Lakers, Barcelona vs. Real Madrid, and England vs. Scotland all rolled into one and you still might not be doing it justice.\n\nThe rivalry between Buenos Aires soccer teams Boca Juniors and River Plate ranks up there with the fiercest, most intense on the planet, and their regular \"Superclasico\" matchups create heated atmospheres that aren't for the faint of heart.\n\nThe next two games, however, will be even more magnified than usual because the clubs will be facing each other in the final of the Copa Libertadores, South America's equivalent of the Champions League.\n\n\"I get goosebumps just thinking about it,\" said Gonzalo Rodriguez Peralta, a 45-year-old River fan who was given club membership by his late father when he was born. \"There's no explanation ... you only understand it when you're there.\"\n\nIt's the first time that Argentina's two biggest teams will meet in the Copa Libertadores final. Boca has won the title six times since the tournament began in 1960, one behind Argentine club Independiente's South American record of seven titles. River has won it three times.\n\n\"Boca and River have raised Argentine soccer where it has never been before,\" Boca Juniors coach Guillermo Barros Schelotto said. \"Regardless of the outcome in these finals, we've put Argentine soccer at the highest level. Today, the whole world is talking about this final.\"\n\nThe first leg will be played Saturday at Boca Juniors' home stadium, an intimidating ground known as \"La Bombonera\" or \"The Chocolate Box\" for its tightly enclosed shape that looks like boxes stacked on top of each other. The second leg will be on Nov. 24 at River's Monumental de Nunez Stadium, where Argentina won its first World Cup in 1978.\n\nAs is usual in recent years, visiting fans will not be allowed at either match because of the fear of violence. It's been that way since 2013 and not even a plea from Argentine President Mauricio Macri, a former Boca president, could change that.\n\nArgentina's most successful teams originated in the docks of the southern working-class Buenos Aires neighborhood of La Boca and their rivalry dates back to the early 20th century.\n\nBoca was founded by a group of Italian immigrants who chose the blue and yellow club colors after the flag of a Swedish ship that arrived in port. River, with its white shirt and diagonal red stripe, moved to a northern affluent neighborhood during the league's beginnings. The derby's gritty play, passionate fans and colorful celebrations was once ranked by British newspaper The Observer in its top spot of the 50 sporting things you must do before you die.\n\nSome of history's best players have come from Boca and River. Diego Maradona, who captained Argentina to the 1986 World Cup title, spent two stints at Boca and has his VIP seat reserved at the stadium. Playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme and prolific goal scorer Martin Palermo were part of a golden era when the club even beat all-mighty Real Madrid for the Intercontinental Cup in 2000.\n\nRiver Plate takes pride in having produced world-class players like Alfredo Di Stefano, who began his career at the club and went on to win five European Cup titles with Real Madrid. Or Enzo Francescoli, an inspiration for France great Zinedine Zidane, who named one of his children after the Uruguayan forward.\n\nAlthough it's the first time Boca and River will play each other for the Copa Libertadores title, the teams have met in the South American competition three times previously. Boca won in the 2000 quarterfinals 4-2 on aggregate and in the 2004 semifinals on a penalty shootout. River won the 2015 round-of-16 match in 1-0 after tournament organizers eliminated Boca because of pepper spray spread by its fans in the second leg.\n\n\"No one can erase what has been done,\" River coach Marcelo Gallardo said recently. \"But now, it's a whole new story, one more page in this book. It will be up to us to continue being part of this history.\"\n\nRiver is looking for its second Copa Liberatdores title in the last three years, a huge achievement considering the team was relegated to the second division in 2011 \u2014 a painful blow that triggered riots between police and fans.\n\nGallardo, a former River player, has restored River's pride since taking over in 2014, winning several championships and last year's Argentine Super Cup against Boca.\n\nOf course, none of that matters to Boca Juniors.\n\n\"This is not one more game in the league. This is a final,\" Barros Schelotto said. \"The only thing in my mind is to try to win these two games.\"\n\nBoth coaches have plenty to play for. Besides gaining iconic status among the legions of fans for each team, the winning coach also would improve his prospects of taking over Argentina's national team.\n\nGallardo will be at a bit of a disadvantage, though. He will miss the first match after being sanctioned by South American soccer's governing body for failing to follow a previous suspension that banned him from contacting his players during the semifinals.\n\nOn the field, Boca's best-known player is forward Carlos Tevez, who appeared in two World Cups for Argentina and previously played for clubs including Juventus, Manchester United and Manchester City. But these days, the team depends on striker Dario Benedetto, whose goals helped the club reach the final.\n\nRiver striker Gonzalo \"Pity\" Martinez could be the one to watch on the other side. He scored in the last two matches against Boca and is expected to return after recovering from the flu. Other key players include midfielder Juan Quintero and Franco Armani, who is considered one of the best goalkeepers in Latin America.\n\n\"The pressure is very high because the public is following closely and the result will matter to them. It will be remembered for many years because it is a unique final,\" said Oscar Mangione, a sports psychologist who has worked with Boca but is a devoted River fan. \"It now depends on the players, on the coaches and how they deal with that pressure.\"\n\nThe pressure, the history, the animosity: No one in Argentina seems to be talking about anything else.\n\n\"We're living a unique moment,\" Boca captain Pablo Perez said, \"first because it's a final, and second because it's against River.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Debora Rey contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Tennessee safety Todd Kelly Jr. always believed he'd play for his hometown school again and end his college career on his own terms, no matter how much his knee problems threatened to derail those plans.\n\nNow the fifth-year senior is getting that chance.\n\nKelly was Tennessee's leading tackler two years ago , but a knee injury limited him to two games in 2017 and sidelined him for the start of this season. After working his way back, Kelly has started Tennessee's last two games to boost an injury-riddled secondary.\n\n\"I never had a doubt in my mind that I was going to play the game of football again,\" Kelly said.\n\nKelly might not ever recapture the form he showed in 2016, when he recorded 71 tackles for a team that went 9-4 and finished in the Top 25. But the fact he's playing at all shows the tenacity of this Knoxville resident.\n\n\"Todd will be the first to tell you he's probably not the same player that he was two or three years ago because of his leg, but it's kind of a testament to his character about working hard to get back to give himself an opportunity,\" Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt said. \"He's a smart guy who's got a toughness. We're glad that he has got himself able to play.\"\n\nKelly's knee injury caused him to play just two games last year during a 4-8 season that included the firing of Butch Jones , the coach who recruited him to Tennessee. Kelly graduated in May with a degree in biological sciences, so he had no real need to return for a fifth year and try to impress a new coaching staff.\n\nHe came back anyway and said it wasn't a tough decision at all.\n\n\"My blood runs orange,\" said Kelly, the son of former Tennessee defensive end and first-round draft pick Todd Kelly Sr. \"I grew up here, a Knoxville native. So when I had a decision to come back again, why would I not try to extend my career for this ball team and for this community and this city? I wanted to play for Coach Pruitt. He's a great coach, a great defensive mind.\"\n\nEven when he hurt himself again during an offseason incident in which he fell from a 30-foot wall and required a trip to the hospital, Kelly remained steadfast in his desire to return. The fall occurred during an argument with his girlfriend that didn't result in any charges.\n\nHis comeback wouldn't be easy.\n\nKelly sat out Tennessee's first four games as he worked his way back. His first appearance of the season was in special-teams duty Sept. 29 against Georgia. He accepted this lesser role and devoted himself to helping out his younger teammates.\n\n\"He had a significant injury,\" Pruitt said. \"He worked really hard to give himself a chance to come back. It was late in the summer before he was actually kind of running around and participating a little bit, and as long as he'd been off, it takes a while to get your body back in shape.\"\n\nHis responsibilities expanded as Tennessee (4-5, 1-4 SEC) dealt with injuries to safeties Micah Abernathy and Trevon Flowers, who have each missed the Vols' last four games. Pruitt says the availability of Flowers and Abernathy for Saturday's matchup with No. 12 Kentucky (7-2, 5-2, No. 11 College Football Playoff) will be a game-time decision.\n\nKelly made six tackles in a 27-24 loss at South Carolina two weeks ago. He followed that up by getting seven tackles in a 14-3 victory over Charlotte last week.\n\n\"He just kept his head down and kept grinding,\" safety Nigel Warrior said. \"He wanted to get back on the field, and that's what he's doing now. He's doing a great job. He's fighting. Every day, he's fighting.\"\n\nAfter growing up in Knoxville as the son of a former Tennessee star, Kelly has a special appreciation for this opportunity.\n\nHe's savoring this final chance and wants to make the most of it.\n\n\"I've learned so much about the game of football and about this program that I didn't even know when I was younger, coming to every home game in the stands in Section YY, looking down on the Tennessee Volunteers running through the 'T,' \" Kelly said. \"When I think about how I have only two more opportunities to do that, it's a blessing. I'm going to cherish every moment.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Venter dropkicked three extra points in the game. (David Pennock/Shepherd University Athletics via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nRuan Venter learned how to dropkick playing rugby in his native South Africa and sometimes would do it for fun during football practices at NCAA Division II Shepherd University in West Virginia.\n\nUntil a couple weeks ago, he wouldn't have fathomed dropkicking in a game.\n\nIn scenes harkening to a bygone era, Venter successfully dropkicked three extra points to the delight of teammates, fans, game officials and even opposing West Virginia Wesleyan on Oct. 27. Venter, whose first name is pronounced Roo-On, hopes to get another opportunity in his senior day game against Virginia-Wise on Saturday.\n\nA standout punter who has drawn the attention of NFL scouts, Venter is the first player known to have scored on a dropkick since Matt Newman of Division III Illinois College did it against Grinnell in September 2013.\n\n\"I had no idea about the history of it,\" Venter said. \"I did dropkicks my whole life, and by doing them again I thought about back home, being outside and doing the dropkicks with friends in my home country. Maybe I miss it a little bit. But it also made me excited I could bring that kind of kicking back into the game and, with that, making the people happy and making some history for them as well.\"\n\nThe dropkick was a staple of football back in the days of leather helmets. The kicker takes the snap, holds the ball waist high and drops it straight down as he strides with his non-kicking leg. He strikes the ball as it touches the ground or just as it bounces up.\n\nThe popularity of the forward pass led to the evolution of the ball in the 1930s, from more rounded to sleeker and pointed on the ends. That made it easier to throw but more difficult to dropkick because bounces off the drop became unpredictable. Thus, the dropkick became a novelty.\n\nShepherd coach Ernie McCook knew about Venter's special talent and had the team practice extra points and field goals with Venter dropkicking in case an emergency came up.\n\nVenter's time came after the team's regular kicker, who had struggled with back tightness for a week, missed two straight extra points. McCook wanted to preserve the freshman backup kicker's redshirt year, so Venter was the next option.\n\nVenter is a capable place-kicker, but he is the team's regular holder, and McCook wasn't comfortable with anyone else doing the holding.\n\n\"At that point,\" McCook said, \"the dropkick was the best option for us.\"\n\nMcCook had given the officials a heads-up a dropkick might be coming. Venter split the uprights to give Shepherd a 32-7 lead in what would be a 58-35 win.\n\n\"As the officials were jogging up the field to set the ball for the kickoff,\" McCook said, \"they said, 'Hey, Coach, thanks for that one, man. That's off my bucket list. I always wanted to see one.'\"\n\nWVW coach Del Smith said that first dropkick came as a big surprise. He and his team saw four more, and blocked one. Venter pushed another one wide right.\n\n\"Kudos to them for having that in their back pocket,\" Smith said. \"In general, when I see guys get creative schematically, when you're in this business, of course you enjoy it. You just hope it's not at your expense.\"\n\nVenter said he planned to ask McCook to give him another chance if Shepherd (7-2) gets a comfortable lead against Virginia-Wise (3-6).\n\n\"I would always entertain it,\" McCook said. \"I love it when our kids get a chance to have a lot of fun. He's been a great player and a great person in our program. I won't tell you it's out of the question. It's something we would consider. We're going to just focus on winning the game first.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 There's some irony to what Cooper Rothe is doing.\n\nGrowing up in Longmont, Colorado, Rothe never thought he'd be a kicker. In fact, he rarely passed up the opportunity to rib those who seemed to have the simplest task in football.\n\n\"Even in high school, I couldn't imagine myself being a kicker,\" Rothe said. \"I was always the kid that made fun of those kickers. Like, 'Dang, that's probably the easiest job. Why can't you just make everything?'\"\n\nBut that's exactly what he became during his prep career, splitting his time at Longmont High as a kicker and defensive back. Three years later, Wyoming's placekicker is one of the best in college football.\n\nRothe has connected on 94 percent of his field goals this season, putting himself on pace for one of the best seasons ever for a Wyoming placekicker. He's six shy of setting a single-season school record for made field goals with at least two games left starting with the Cowboys' Nov. 17 matchup against Air Force.\n\nThe 5-foot-11, 174-pound junior made his first 15 field goals this season and hit on 18 straight dating back to last year's Famous Idaho Potato Bowl \u2014 the longest streak in the nation \u2014 before missing on a 43-yard attempt midway through the first quarter of a chilly, gusty win over San Jose State last week. Winds inside War Memorial Stadium reached more than 30 miles per hour at times, though Rothe said they were worse during warmups.\n\nHe realized he'd overcompensated for the wind once the ball left his foot. The kick went wide right.\n\n\"I think I tried placing it a certain way and I think it didn't move it as much, so I think I should've just trusted it a little bit more with my normal swing,\" Rothe told the Casper Star-Tribune. \"But it was moving a little bit.\n\n\"I guess it was fun to have a little streak going there, but to start another one is the goal, I think. I guess the goal every game is to make every field goal, and obviously that didn't happen.\"\n\nRegardless of the distance, it's happened far more often than not. Rothe has converted at an 80-percent clip for his career with five of his field goals this season covering at least 40 yards, including a career-long 51-yarder at Missouri on Sept. 8.\n\n\"A lot of those points have added up,\" Wyoming coach Craig Bohl said. \"He's been really consistent. He's owned his work. He spends a lot of time watching himself. We videotape a lot of his kicks, so he's been a real student of the game.\"\n\nIt's been a gradual progression the last three years for Rothe, who made just 65 percent (13 of 20) of his kicks as a freshman. The misses ate at him so much that Rothe said he got to where he was attempting more than 50 field goals during practice, which left bruises on his foot. It served as a lesson in preparation that's ultimately helped preserve his stamina.\n\n\"I knew I had things to work on, but I thought it was just things I had to fix right away, so I'd just be kicking 24-7 instead of watching film and learning that way,\" Rothe said. \"I think learning that way and learning there's a certain amount of balls you can kick in practice and the rest is just mental.\n\n\"Now it's down between 20 and 30 (during practice). I think that's helped my leg a lot.\"\n\nRothe improved drastically on his consistency last season, connecting on 83 percent (15 of 18) of his field goals that included a career-long 49-yarder at the time. Now he's the national leader in field-goal percentage amid a breakout season in which he's a semifinalist for the Lou Groza Award, which is annually awarded to the nation's top collegiate placekicker.\n\n\"No matter how far the kick or what situation it is in the game, just keep the same mindset to do one job \u2014 make a field goal,\" Rothe said. \"Even on kickoffs, just do your job, trust your teammates and try to reward the offense for the field position and get them points.\"\n\nRothe can't help but get a kick out of it all in more ways than one.\n\n\"I definitely couldn't imagine this, so it's a blessing to be here,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Casper (Wyo.)

(Photo: Mark J. Terrill, AP)\n\nThe sale of the high-capacity magazine used by a gunman who killed at least 12 people at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California, late Wednesday is prohibited under California law and possessing it would have been illegal, too, by a state law currently blocked by a federal court.\n\nSheriff Geoff Dean said the gunman, who was also killed, was armed with a Glock 21 \u2013 a .45-caliber, semi-automatic handgun.\n\n\"The weapon was designed in California to hold a magazine of 10 rounds and one in the chamber, but he had an extended magazine on it,\" Dean said.\n\nDean did not specify the size of the extended magazine, but most high-capacity magazines for the gun that are for sale online hold 26 rounds. \"Drum\" magazines that are compatible with the handgun can hold as many as 40 rounds.\n\nCalifornia has outlawed the sale of magazines larger than 10 rounds since 2000 but owners who owned larger ones before the law took effect were permitted to keep them. But Gun control advocates argued the previous law was not effective because there was no way to determine when or where a high-capacity magazine was purchased.\n\nIn 2016, California voters approved a proposition in the wake of the San Bernardino shooting, which made it illegal to possess magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds. Those whose magazines previously had been \"grandfathered\" were required to alter them or get rid of them.\n\nMore: What we know about Thousand Oaks gunman Ian David Long, a Marine veteran\n\nMore: What we know about the mass shooting at a Thousand Oaks, California, dance bar\n\nCLOSE A witness to the California nightclub shooting describes the scene when gunshots rang out, killing 12 people. USA TODAY\n\nBefore the new law could take effect, it was blocked by a federal judge after a lawsuit by California gun owners, argued the law was unconstitutional. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the injunction pending the resolution of the lawsuit, which was joined by the California Rifle & Pistol Association, the state National Rifle Association affiliate.\n\nAdam Skaggs, chief counsel for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said the magazine used in Thousand Oaks was probably obtained illegally because it's unlikely the 28-year-old gunman purchased before the 2000 law was passed.\n\n\"It just confirms the serious safety risks that these magazines entail,\" Skaggs said.\n\n\"When someone is forced to stop and reload it creates an opportunity to escape. It creates an opportunity to try and disable the shooter. That's why restricting access to these is so important in terms of making mass shootings less deadly.\"\n\nSkaggs said it is no single gun law can prevent every mass shooting and that it is impossible to know if the shooter would have obtained a high-capacity magazine with or without the \"unfortunate\" court injunction.\n\nBut he said that if the law prohibiting high-capacity magazines is \"enforced and put into effect, it's going to reduce the number of potentially dangerous shooters who have access to these types of devices, and in the long run will save lives.\"\n\nGun rights activists argue that the government cannot prevent all acts of violence and that people are safer when they exercise, rather than restrict, the Second Amendment.\n\n\"Once more we see the devastating effects of the illusion of safety that gun control laws and policies are founded upon,\" the Firearms Policy Coalition said in a statement Thursday. \"Gun control proponents like Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s incoming governor, are irrationally committed to passing more and more laws that just do not prevent violent people from doing evil things.\"\n\n'He died a hero': Ventura County Sheriff Sgt. Ron Helus among those killed in Thousand Oaks bar shooting\n\nMore: Some Thousand Oaks victims survived mass shooting in Las Vegas, reports say\n\nCalifornia has some of the more restrictive gun laws in the country and federal law is somewhat stricter when it comes to handguns.\n\nAnyone who buys or is given a handgun in California has to get a state-issued firearm safety certificate, which comes with a fee of up to $25 and must be renewed every five years.\n\nIn California, even \"private party transfers\" \u2013 such as those at gun shows \u2013 must involve a licensed firearms dealer, unless the person is giving or selling the gun to a family member.\n\nConcealed carry permits in California can be issued by a sheriff, if a person can show that they need one. The state does not honor carry permits issued by other jurisdictions. On Monday, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal from California residents challenging the law.\n\nThere is also a minimum 10-day waiting period and in addition to the federally-mandated background check, the California Department of Justice is required to check its own records and records from the Department of State Hospitals, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nGabby Giffords, a former Democratic member of the House of Representatives, was shot along with 18 others while meeting with constituents in 2011. The gunman in that attack used a Glock 19 pistol and carried two 33-round magazines, according to The Washington Post.\n\nUnder federal law, a person has to be 21 to buy a handgun from a dealer and 18 to get a handgun from an individual. Rifles and shotguns can be sold to people 18 and over, and unlicensed individuals can give them to people of any age, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nUnder the 1968 Gun Control Act, anytime someone buys two or more handguns within five days, it must be reported to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nBecause of concerns about guns being run into Mexico, multiple rifle sales must also be reported to the ATF in the four southern border states: Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas. That policy expires in 2021. Outside of those states, multiple rifle or shotgun sales in other states do not have to be reported, regardless of the number.\n\n\"California has among the strongest gun laws in the nation and as a result, thankfully, incidents like this occur much less frequently in California than they do in states with more permiss gun laws,\" Skaggs said,\n\n\"But as today made abundantly clear, as San Bernardino made abundantly clear, even in California the risk of this kind of horrific shooting is unavoidable.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\n110818-thousand-oaks-ca-shooting_Online (Photo: USA TODAY)\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/08/thousand-oaks-shooting-court-blocked-law-barring-gunmans-magazine/1928201002/", "", "Fresh off of taking shots at a New York Post sports media writer and ranting about the new Mets general manager, Mike Francesa is in another feud with a Boomer Esiason show that happens to broadcast on the same network as his: WFAN.\n\nFrancesa has been in fights with Esiason\u2019s morning show before \u2014 when Craig Carton was a co-host, they pair would regularly rip Francesa on the air.

Watt (99) and linebacker Jadeveon Clowney (90) celebrate a stop against the Dallas Cowboys during the second half of an NFL football game in Houston. Houston is the second team in NFL history to win six in a row after opening 0-3 and the first since the Giants did it in 1970. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Ask Jadeveon Clowney how the Houston Texans turned around their season by winning six straight games after an 0-3 start and the hulking defensive end breaks into song.\n\n\"Started from the bottom now we're here,\" he bellows. \"Started from the bottom now the whole team here.\"\n\nWhile the 2013 Drake tune is a little old to be the team's anthem, the sentiment of the song couldn't be more fitting for these Texans.\n\nThey occupied the basement of the AFC South after opening the season with losses to New England, Tennessee and the New York Giants by a combined 13 points. After falling into such a big hole early, the Texans were written off by many as headed to a lost season.\n\nEveryone insists that such a defeatist sentiment never took hold within the team, with the struggles galvanizing them to get on track and prove the doubters wrong.\n\n\"Don't quit. Everyone keeps fighting. Everyone keeps believing,\" quarterback Deshaun Watson said. \"Everyone keeps fighting to the very, very end. That is what we do. Regardless of the situation or the adversity, we are always going to keep fighting. That is how we feel.\"\n\nHouston is the second team in NFL history to win six in a row after opening 0-3, the first since the Giants in 1970. The winning streak has the Texans in first place in their division and in good position to compete for their third AFC South title in the last four seasons.\n\nA big reason for Houston's turnaround has been the play of Watson and defensive end J.J. Watt. Both have started each game this year after having their 2017 seasons cut short by major injuries. Watson tore a knee ligament in practice after appearing in seven games in 2017. Watt played just eight games in the previous two years because of back surgeries and a broken leg.\n\nWatt is tied for third in the NFL with nine sacks and his four forced fumbles are tied for most in the league.\n\n\"I know he probably doesn't want to talk about it too much, but I've never seen anything like it,\" coach Bill O'Brien said. \"To come back from what he's been able to come back from, some really serious injuries, and to be able to play at the level that he's playing at, it just says all you need to know about him and how much he cares about the team and how much he wants to help this organization win.\"\n\nWatson, the 12th overall pick in last year's draft, has thrown for 2,389 yards with 17 touchdowns and seven interceptions despite being slowed by lung and rib injuries. O'Brien said his diligence in coming to the facility every day after his injury last season to study film and talk to coaches has helped Watson take a step forward this year.\n\n\"He's grown a lot,\" O'Brien said. \"He's just an awesome guy to work with. He cares about studying, he cares about putting time in to prepare for each game. I think he's learned a lot about NFL defenses. He's had a lot thrown at him defensively this year, whether it's third-down defenses, red-area defenses. He's improved every week.\"\n\nWatson has been helped by the stellar play of receiver DeAndre Hopkins, who is No. 3 in the NFL with 894 yards receiving and whose seven touchdowns are tied for second. The Texans hope that new addition Demaryius Thomas, acquired in a trade with Denver last Tuesday, will make more of an impact after the break with some time to learn the offense.\n\nHopkins, who has five touchdowns in the last four games, said despite this strong stretch the Texans are approaching things the same way they did when they were desperate for a victory.\n\n\"We've got the same mentality, and that's win,\" he said. \"That's why we go to practice and that's why we wake up every day. It's the same mentality we had when we were 0-3. Nothing's changed.\"\n\nThey know that if they let up, their season will end prematurely, just as it did when they went 4-12 in 2017.\n\nO'Brien let out a slight chuckle when asked if 0-3 feels like forever ago.\n\n\"It's not a really long time ago,\" he said. \"I think our players understand that, and I think the difference between 0-3 and where we are now is not a big difference. We're just making some more plays, we're coaching some things better. I think our guys have to \u2014 and they do \u2014 understand that every week is going to be difficult.\"\n\nFirst up is a trip to Washington on Nov. 18 before a Monday night matchup with Tennessee on Nov. 26 in the first of three straight home games when a win would be key in moving closer to taking their division.\n\n\"It's just important to note that we haven't been blowing anybody out,\" safety Tyrann Mathieu said. \"I don't think we are a complacent group of guys. We've been in some fist fights, some real close ballgames, so it's not like everything is cookie cutter and everything is going all good for us.\"\n\n\"We still have things we can improve on and work on, so I think that's what's going to keep us pushing forward.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

President Donald Trump was in attendance. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The subject before the Supreme Court last week was an 1855 treaty giving an Indian tribe the right to travel for trade. The question was whether Washington state has a right to tax what tribal members transport.\n\nNear the end of the hourlong oral argument, Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh directed a friendly observation to the lawyer representing a tribal business.\n\n\"To state the obvious, the value, current value of the land the tribe gave up is enormous, right?\" Kavanaugh said.\n\n\"It's a third of the state of Washington, I believe, your honor,\" Adam Unikowsky responded.\n\nThe brief exchange was emblematic of Kavanaugh's style during his first month on the high court, which followed a contentious confirmation battle that included accusations of decades-old sexual assault. So far, he has emphasized \"common sense\" over conservatism.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump pose with Supreme Court justices prior to Brett Kavanaugh's investiture ceremony Nov. 8, 2018, in Washington, D.C.

(Photo: Fred Schilling, Collection of the Supreme Court)\n\nThat was evident the next day, when he asked a Justice Department lawyer about a class-action settlement stemming from Google's disclosure of customers' internet searches.\n\n\"That seems a harm,\" Kavanaugh said, \"just as a common-sense matter.\"\n\nThis week, he confronted Missouri's state solicitor over the state's plan to execute a medically compromised prisoner by lethal injection, despite potential risks.\n\n\"Are you saying even if the method creates gruesome and brutal pain, you can still do it because there's no alternative?\" Kavanaugh asked. \"Is there any limit on that?\"\n\nThe newest justice was sworn in again Thursday by Chief Justice John Roberts during a brief, formal investiture ceremony at the court attended by President Donald Trump and Washington's legal cognoscenti. In a break from tradition taken because of security concerns, he did not descend the courthouse steps afterward.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh pose in the Justices\u2019 Conference Room before an investiture ceremony at the Supreme Court on Nov. 8, 2018, in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Fred Schilling, Collection of the Supreme Court)\n\n'More Roberts than Gorsuch'\n\nEvery new Supreme Court justice takes on the lifetime appointment differently. Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, who survived his confirmation battle in 1991 after similar accusations of sexual harassment, went virtually silent on the bench. Last year, Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch made clear he would be his own man, dissenting on principle early and often.\n\nKavanaugh, by contrast, has sought to blend in seamlessly. He's been collegial with his colleagues on the left and right. He's been intently focused during oral arguments, like a student who sits in front and raises his hand often.\n\nPerhaps most significantly \u2013 from the limited evidence \u2013 he has not joined the court's most conservative justices in public dissent on two major issues. Neither has Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\n\u201cThe early signs,\" says Ian Millhiser, senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress, \"suggest that he is more Roberts than Gorsuch.\u201d\n\nAfter a confirmation process that lasted from early July to early October, Kavanaugh, 53, had good reason to keep a low profile.\n\nHe was the second nominee of a controversial president. He came with a lengthy paper trail \u2013 so lengthy that Senate Republicans refused to release it all \u2013 that included stints investigating Bill Clinton and serving George W. Bush.\n\nNear the end of the process, he was accused of sexual abuse allegedly committed when he was a high school student in the 1980s. He vehemently denied the accusations at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which he blamed Democrats and liberal interest groups.\n\nKavanaugh's 50-48 confirmation Oct. 6 was the narrowest margin in 137 years. Three days later, he was on the bench, hearing two criminal law cases. He was well-versed in the material, referring to \"page 139 of the Curtis Johnson opinion.\"\n\nThat he chose neither to fire back at his critics from the bench nor appear overly contrite is evidence that Kavanaugh intends to be what he promised at his ceremonial White House swearing-in last month: \"a team player on the team of nine.\"\n\n\"The Supreme Court is an institution of law. It is not a partisan or political institution. The justices do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle. We do not caucus in separate rooms,\" he said \u2013 words later quoted by Roberts in hopes of allaying Americans' concerns.\n\nAdam Feldman, who follows the Supreme Court closely as curator of the Supreme Court blog Empirical SCOTUS, said Kavanaugh appears to have chosen an \"ostrich approach to begin with.\"\n\n\"He's not making any waves at the outset,\" Feldman said.\n\n'Why complicate the law?'\n\nHigh court justices can be judged by the opinions they write, the votes they take and the comments they make during oral arguments. This term, the court has issued only one opinion, and the vote was 8-0. Kavanaugh wasn't on the court to hear the case.\n\n\u201cThe written opinions of any justice are the most important part of what they do at the Supreme Court, and we have yet to see any opinions by Justice Kavanaugh,\u201d noted Elizabeth Slattery, a legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. \u201cIt is a bit soon to tell how he\u2019s going to vote.\u201d\n\nThe court has been asked several times by the Justice Department to block lower court trials on two hot-button topics: administration efforts to ask about citizenship on the 2020 Census, and a lawsuit aimed at forcing a change in federal policies on climate change.\n\nIn each case, the court refused the request, and several conservative justices dissented, including Thomas and Gorsuch. Kavanaugh pointedly did not announce a dissent, which either means he agreed with the court's action or did not want his opposition known.\n\nThe former federal appeals court judge did not align with liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer last month when they objected to a scheduled execution in Tennessee. The prisoner, Edmund Zagorski, eventually was electrocuted.\n\nThe absence of votes pro or con leaves high court observers with just 15 oral arguments to scour for evidence of Kavanaugh's intellectual curiosity and ideological inclinations. They show him to be a student of the Constitution, Congress and Supreme Court precedent \u2013 and also someone seeking practical solutions.\n\nFaced with an Idaho man's effort to appeal his convictions on assault and drug charges despite having waived that right in a plea agreement, Kavanaugh said appeals courts such as the one he served on for 12 years can handle such disputes.\n\n\"I'm not sure there's any evidence of a problem,\" he said. \"And if there's not evidence of a problem, why complicate the law?\"\n\nMore: Democratic senators lost in battleground states after voting against Kavanaugh\n\nMore: Brett Kavanaugh vote: Will 'asterisk justice' bring political stain to Supreme Court?\n\nMore: Abortion, race, gay rights, death penalty: Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh could make the difference\n\nMore: Supreme Court: Conservative groups see opportunities to cut regulation, shore up property rights\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/08/brett-kavanaugh-new-supreme-court-justice-aims-common-sense/1919464002/", "CLOSE White House spox Sarah Sanders shared video proof of Jim Acosta's aggression with intern at press conference.

(Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images)\n\nThe pollsters predicted that Democrats would take the House but that Republicans would keep the Senate.\n\nAnd on those broad contours, they were right. Nate Silver, the statistician behind the site Five Thirty-Eight, called it \"a super good night for polling.\"\n\nAnd yet pollsters also got some specific races wrong \u2013 and they were among the most-polled and important races. They include:\n\n\u25ba Most pre-election polls had Florida Democrat Bill Nelson holding on to his Senate seat \u2014 by about 2.4 percentage points, according to the Real Clear Politics average. Republican Rick Scott is winning it by 0.2 points in the final, unofficial results.\n\n\u25ba Similarly, polls had Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum up by an average of 3.6 points in the race for Florida governor. He lost to the Republican, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, by 0.7 points.\n\n\u25ba Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly had a slight lead in the polls over his challenger, Republican businessman Mike Braun. On Election Day, Braun won the seat decisively, by 7.8 points.\n\n\u25ba The most recent polls had Democrat Rich Cordray becoming Ohio's next governor by a 3- to 6-point margin. Ohio's Republican attorney general, Mike DeWine, won by 4.3 points.\n\nSo what did pollsters do wrong?\n\nIn many cases, maybe nothing.\n\nSome of those polls were within the margin of error, but still got the result wrong in razor-tight races. And since pollsters generally use a confidence interval of 95 percent, one out of 20 polls will be a statistical outlier \u2013 that is, outside the margin of error \u2013 just by chance.\n\nPolls also might have missed late shifts in the electorate, such as higher-than-expected turnout. At least 47.5 percent of eligible voters turned out this year, according to Michael McDonald of the American Elections Project. That was the highest percentage for a midterm since 1966.\n\n\"These polls are not magic,\" said Christopher Wlezien, a political scientist at the University of Texas at Austin. \"They\u2019re built on a lot of assumptions.\"\n\nWlezien has studied more than 30,000 election polls from 1942 through 2017, and matched them to the final results. His conclusion: On average, polling is not getting any worse \u2013 and it's probably getting better with each cycle.\n\nModern polling does have its challenges. Cell phones and caller ID have made it more difficult for pollsters to reach voters.\n\n\"But it\u2019s not like these pollsters haven't adapted, or tried to adapt,\" Wlezien said. \"And one of the things I think is their ability to take data and weight it. So even though they might not have a representative sample, they can adjust it.

A growing sex-abuse problem in Olympic sports has led to a steady stream of Congressional hearings and a three-year grant worth $2.2 million. Yet not a penny of those federal funds can be used to fight the actual problem: investigating or resolving more than 800 open cases, many brought by victims themselves. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 A growing sex-abuse problem in Olympic sports has led to a steady stream of Congressional hearings and a three-year grant worth $2.2 million.\n\nYet not a penny of those federal funds can be used to fight the actual problem: investigating or resolving more than 800 open cases, many brought by victims themselves.\n\nThat leaves an ever-growing backlog for the U.S. Center for SafeSport, the organization that opened 20 months ago to investigate sex-abuse complaints in Olympic sports.\n\n\"We didn't realize until the (bid instructions for the grant) came out that we would not be able to use it for performing investigations,\" said SafeSport CEO Shellie Pfohl. \"Clearly, that is a need, and we are continuing to look for more robust funding, both from government sources, as well as from outside of government.\"\n\nSafeSport's mission is to investigate cases and serve as an independent clearinghouse for educating about abuse, with the authority to ban athletes and coaches across organizations that run Olympic sports in the United States. It is backed by the U.S. Olympic Committee, which took steps to decertify USA Gymnastics this week for botching an organizational rebuild following the sexual abuse scandal involving now-imprisoned team doctor Larry Nassar.\n\nTo be sure, the money \u2014 SafeSport will use $1 million in the first year, $875,000 in Year 2 and $378,000 in Year 3 \u2014 represents a significant infusion for an office operating on $6.4 million in 2018. But according to the rules of the Justice Department grant awarded last month, it must all be directed toward prevention and education programs, and for auditing national governing bodies' work in sex-abuse prevention \u2014 not the most acute needs for an operation that has struggled to hire investigators to look into the 1,622 complaints, an average of 85 a month, that have come its way.\n\nThe backlog is growing steadily, with spikes coming whenever sex-abuse and assault cases make big headlines.\n\nNot long after opening, when the #MeToo movement and Nassar allegations were in the headlines, the number of reports coming into the center rose from 20 to 30 a month to that same number each week. Over the two weeks that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation topped the news because of sexual assault allegations that he denies, the center received 135 calls.\n\nThe center has 14 employees on its response and resolution team, including six full-time investigators and another dozen who work on a contract basis. According to numbers provided by the center, full-time investigators handle an average of 10 active cases at any given time and the contractors handle between three and six. That means no more than 132 of the 800-plus cases are being investigated at any given time.\n\nThe $2.2 million grant won't help resolve any of those manpower issues.\n\n\"We're looking at all kinds of strategies of knocking down that backlog,\" Pfohl said. \"It's not just throwing bodies at the workload. It's also being very strategic about the type of people we're hiring who can help folks from the time they call us to submit a report.\"\n\nThe Senate subcommittee hearings being chaired by Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, may lead to revisiting the law that formed the USOC, potentially reshaping the relationship between the USOC and the 50 national governing bodies it oversees. More stringent language about handling sex-abuse cases could be added.\n\nA spokeswoman for Moran said the panel is reviewing whether the center needs additional resources but could not explain the reason the grant was written the way it was.\n\n\"Senator Moran ... is uniquely positioned to address resource-related concerns as appropriate,\" said spokeswoman Morgan Said. Lawmakers are looking for other ways to fund the center, she said.\n\nThe U.S. Olympic Committee provides $3.1 million a year for SafeSport. Earlier this year, the organizations that run Olympic sports in America (national governing bodies) doubled their contributions to $2 million total per year in 2019, which at the time increased SafeSport's overall budget by about 25 percent.\n\nWhen the USOC pushed to open the center amid growing outrage over slow responses to scandals in swimming, taekwondo and other sports, it searched for funding across the sports landscape \u2014 from pro leagues to the NCAA and elsewhere \u2014 but found few backers. The relative dearth of cash flow has slowed the center's mission.\n\nSince its opening, SafeSport investigations have led to 381 disciplinary actions, including 222 cases that led to permanent ineligibility.\n\nThe discipline is similar to what the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency does on the drug front.\n\nBy comparison, USADA, which also must fund a robust testing system, reported $21 million in revenue in 2017, $9.5 million of which came from a grant from the federal Office of National Drug Control Policy and another $5.1 million of which came from the USOC. There were no significant strings attached to USADA's government grant.\n\n(The USOC, chastened by critics for not reacting strongly enough to the Russian doping scandal, increased USADA funding by about 35 percent from 2016. Under similar criticism, it has doubled its outlay to the SafeSport Center since the opening.)\n\nEarlier this year, Congress passed a bill requiring that the USOC and sports federations under its umbrella report abuse allegations to law enforcement. It also granted authority to SafeSport as a place for athletes to report abuse allegations. The Senate version of that bill included $1 million for the SafeSport center, but that funding was stripped when the bill reached the House.\n\nThe grant, part of the omnibus spending bill, originally was written to be $2.5 million per year for five years, but the full amount was not appropriated, Pfohl said.\n\nThat left $2.2 million total over three years, and though the SafeSport center was the only legitimate competitor for the money, it still needed about six months to apply for and receive the grant.\n\n\"When you know the original bill was worth $2.5 million for five years, then you come to find out that the actual final allocation is $2 million over three years that can't be used for investigations, it's just a slap in the face for an important effort,\" said Max Cobb, the American NGB leader who spearheaded that group's funding increase.\n\n___\n\nThis version clarifies that when national governing bodies increased their SafeSport funding, it increased SafeSport's overall budget by 25 percent. The contributions themselves doubled.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://apnews.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Kelly called Book day-to-day.\n\nBut a person speaking to the AP on condition of anonymity said Wimbush is set to be the starter and Book is not expected to play after taking a hard hit to the back and ribs last week against Northwestern.\n\n\"He (Wimbush) has gotten the bulk of work,\" Kelly said. \"We'll see what happens Saturday.\"\n\nKelly said freshman Phil Jurkovec got extra work in practice this week.\n\n\"If Phil as to play, we can win,\" Kelly said.\n\nBook replaced Wimbush as the starter in the fourth game of the season for the Fighting Irish (9-0, No. 3 CFP). He is completing 74.5 percent of his passes, tops in the FBS, for 1,824 yards, with 15 touchdowns and four interceptions. With Book starting, the Fighting Irish have averaged 38 points per game. They averaged 23.3 in Wimbush's three starts. Notre Dame is 12-3 in games Wimbush has started the past two seasons.\n\n\"To have a guy like that who, first of all, our players just really respect and are excited if he has the opportunity to play. They'll rally around him,\" Kelly said. \"He doesn't have to come in if has to play and go win the football game. We've got some other pretty good pieces. We've got a pretty good defense.\"\n\nWimbush, a senior, was the starter last season for the Irish, but his inconsistent and inaccurate passing led to Kelly switch to Book. Wimbush has completed 50.8 percent for his career, with 17 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He has been an effective runner, with 1,044 yards and 16 touchdowns.\n\n\"I mean he's good runner of the football, so you're going to see him run the football a little bit. You don't change a ton of what we do,\" Kelly said.\n\nKelly said Wimbush is a \"championship-quality\" quarterback.\n\nNotre Dame goes into its final home game of the season looking to stay undefeated and in position to reach the College Football Playoff. The Seminoles (4-5) have struggled to defend the pass this season, allowing 23 touchdown throws and 282 yards per game, but they have been stingy against the run (2.84 yards per carry).\n\n\"We watched film on them throughout the entire year,\" Florida State coach Willie Taggart said. \"We've seen Wimbush play and know what to expect out of him, too. The offense hasn't changed much from that standpoint.\"\n\nFlorida State has its own uncertainty at quarterback after James Blackman filled in for Deondre Francois last week.

Sessions submitted his resignation on Wednesday, one day after the 2018 midterm elections. USA TODAY\n\nMatthew Whitaker has been named to end Mueller's \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d But the Russia investigation isn't about Trump, it's about defending our democracy.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions at a Trump administration cabinet meeting less than a month before he was forced out, Oct. 17, 2018, Washington, D.C. (Photo: CHIP SOMODEVILLA, Getty Images)\n\nPresident Donald Trump appointed Matthew Whitaker as interim attorney general for one reason.\n\nWhitaker, while a former U.S. Attorney, has had a relatively obscure career. Before Attorney General Jeff Sessions appointed him as his chief of staff, he spent several years not practicing law but running a foundation dedicated to publicizing misdeeds \u2014and alleged misdeeds \u2014 committed by Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, Harry Reid and other Democrats.\n\nBut there is one thing that really made Whitaker stand out for Trump: his public attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, including suggestions on how it might best be sabotaged. Whitaker even suggested that a \u201cstage-crafty\u201d solution to Trump\u2019s Mueller problem would be to \u201creduce his budget to so low that his investigations grind to almost a halt.\u201d\n\nOf course, Russian meddling in the 2016 election is not a hoax. Mueller\u2019s investigation has already resulted in at least 35 indictments or guilty pleas directly related to active Russian election interference. And it is imperative that Mueller be allowed to complete his investigation which \u2014 despite Trump\u2019s insistence otherwise \u2014 is not all about Donald Trump but, instead, about defending our democracy from those who are actively seeking to destroy it.\n\nWhitaker was chosen to end Mueller 'witch hunt'\n\nSo it is beyond question that Matthew Whitaker is not the correct person to oversee Robert Mueller. He has not been appointed so that he can impartially supervise the investigation. He is there to do the president\u2019s bidding and end the \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nIt is very wrong that we should be having this conversation at all. In America, law enforcement should not depend on the whims of one person. We should be relying on our laws and institutions to defend our democracy, not the president\u2019s good will. Fortunately, there is a solution ready and waiting to be voted on.\n\nThe Senate should pass the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, which provides a measure of protection for Mueller\u2019s investigation and ensures that he cannot be removed for political reasons. A Senate committee has already approved the bill on a bipartisan 14-7 vote.\n\nMore: Jeff Sessions\u2019 firing poses grave threat to Robert Mueller inquiry\n\nFlashback: Trump political protection plan is replace Sessions with Mueller saboteur\n\nLove him or hate him, Jeff Sessions is why Mueller's Russia probe is still on track\n\nApart from protecting the current investigation into Russian election meddling, the act makes a lot of sense in general. A special counsel can only be appointed when the Department of Justice itself has a conflict of interest. It seems only reasonable that some checks and balances be in place to ensure that the Justice official supervising the special counsel, whoever it is, cannot remove the special counsel without cause.\n\nWhile the bill has been reported out of committee, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to bring it to the Senate floor for a vote because he believes Trump would not sign it. Perhaps not, but that\u2019s what veto overrides are for. For anyone counting at home, the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act was passed out of committee with a two-thirds majority, which is exactly the majority needed to override a presidential veto.\n\nMcConnell has also refused to let the full Senate vote on the bill protecting the investigation because, he has said, \u201cThere\u2019s no indication that Mueller\u2019s going to be fired.\" Well, Senator McConnell, there is now.\n\nRepublicans are at the end of deniability\n\nIt seems that the day of reckoning has come. Trump has made no effort to hide his loathing of the Mueller investigation. He even repeated his attacks at his news conference Wednesday morning. He has now fired Sessions entirely because Sessions followed the law and refused to interfere with that investigation. In his place, he has appointed someone who thinks the investigation should be shut down. Trump\u2019s and Whitaker\u2019s intentions could not be more clear if they had declared them on Twitter \u2014 which they very well might.\n\nAs a Republican, I am not in favor of replacing our elephant mascot with an ostrich. We have now come to the end of deniability. There is no question that Whitaker has been appointed specifically to terminate or throttle the Mueller investigation. So the question for our congressional leadership is this: Which side are you on? Will you stand up for our institutions and defend our democracy? Or do you believe that defending Trump is more important?\n\nThe base may judge you harshly if you defy Trump and defend the Mueller investigation by passing the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act. But history will judge you more harshly still if you do not.\n\nChris Truax, an appellate lawyer in San Diego, is on the legal advisory board of Republicans for the Rule of Law.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

The problem? The video was doctored. USA TODAY\n\n'Questioning of the president should be fair but also vigorous, and shouldn\u2019t be punished.'\n\nGame of Trumps (Photo: Christopher Weyant/The Boston Globe/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nThe White House revoked the press badge of CNN's Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta Wednesday following a tense exchange with President Donald Trump during a news conference.\n\nAcosta is the Trump of the press corps\n\nBy Bill Goodykoontz\n\nThe White House suspended CNN's Jim Acosta's media credentials Wednesday night, not long after President Donald Trump called him a \"rude, terrible person\" during a news conference.\n\nThis was an astoundingly dumb thing to do, and not just for the reasons you might think a member of the news media would say.\n\nIt's true that Acosta is kind of like the Trump of the White House press corps, someone who relishes the attention and the fight.\n\nThis makes Acosta the absolute worst person in the world to do this to.\n\nTrump and Acosta really went at it when Acosta started asking him questions about the caravan Trump talked a lot about in the run-up to the election.\n\nTrump eventually told Acosta, who kept questioning him and wouldn't pass the microphone to another reporter, to stop talking, and a White House intern tried to take the microphone from the CNN reporter. Acosta pulled it back and Trump got increasingly angry.\n\nTalker: The 5 marquee races of the 2018 midterm elections\n\nSign up for Today's Talker newsletter here\n\nHours later White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced that Acosta's press credentials had been suspended until further notice. The president \"believes in a free press,\" she said in a statement. \"We will, however, never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job.\"\n\nThe incident took place on live television. That\u2019s not what happened. Those in the room with Acosta also vouched for him, saying that he did not place his hands on the woman. It was a bizarre claim, to say the least.\n\nAcosta responded with a tweet that said, \"This is a lie.\" He later tweeted video of the Secret Service taking his credentials. Because of course he did. And now whatever he might lack in access he gains in attention and sympathy.\n\nNow the administration has drawn attention to itself. Will the press corps stand in solidarity with Acosta? Will the questioning become more pointed? People won\u2019t be watching to see what Trump or Sanders say. They\u2019ll be watching to see how they say it. And who knows, maybe that's the idea.\n\nMore seriously, this is chilling and incredibly stupid. You're rude at a press conference and you get your credentials pulled? Since when? Does anyone remember Sam Donaldson? Dan Rather in his pre-anchor days? Neither of them exactly shied away from the spotlight, either. But they asked tough questions and, most of the time, they got answers.\n\nThe point is, questioning of the president should be fair but also vigorous, and shouldn\u2019t be punished. If he dodges, don't let him off the hook. That's your job. Acosta doesn't deserve an answer so much as his audience \u2014 and by extension the American people \u2014 does.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to like the media. (Good thing.) You don\u2019t have to like Acosta. But what they do is essential. So is letting them do it.\n\nBill Goodykoontz is a film critic and media columnist at The Arizona Republic. You can follow him on Twitter: @goodyk.\n\nPoke in the eye (Photo: Nate Beeler/The Columbus (Ohioh) Dispatch/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nWhat our readers are saying\n\nWhite House reporters have a right to ask tough questions, but CNN's Jim Acosta was belligerent and I am glad he got his credentials revoked. His stunt last night was over the line. Acosta may parlay this into his own show, but he should be done at the White House.\n\n\u2014 William Grantmyre Jr.\n\nIt's only \"fake news\" if it's not flattering to President Donald Trump. Maybe if Trump actually behaved like a leader, he'd be treated like one.\n\nTrump has a hell of a nerve telling others that they don't treat people well.\n\n\u2014 Andrew Kleinwaks\n\nTrump was elected by the American people; Acosta is posing as a journalist who is only at the White House as a courtesy. There's a big difference between the two.\n\n\u2014 Jim Reid\n\nIt is stupid and ignorant for Trump to tell a reporter to sit down and be quiet simply because he doesn't want to answer tough questions.\n\nTrump acts like a spoiled child and the intern who took Acosta's mic should never have tried to, in the first place. What is this? A news conference or a kindergarten class? Trump is a bully and he uses the office of the presidency to get even with those he dislikes.\n\n\u2014 Nita Ramos-Arreguy\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nErik Wemple, The Washington Post: \"When a White House emissary lunges for the microphone in your hand, give up the microphone and let the president's petulant insistence on cutting off reporters and moving to other questioners speak for itself. And it speaks loudly: Whatever lines Acosta walked up to in the East Room, Trump, again, walked blissfully across, as he spoke disrespectfully to anyone who dared ask him a difficult question. ... Still more outrageous is the White House's yanking of Acosta's hard pass. The heavy-handed and authoritarian gesture boils down to a chilling reality: Your president has begun choosing who gets to ask him questions.\"\n\nLarry King, RT America: \"CNN stopped doing news a long time ago. They do Trump. Fox is Trump TV and MSNBC is anti-Trump all the time. ... Trump is the story in America. ... They covered him as a character. They carried every speech he made. They carried more of him than Fox News, at the beginning. And so they built the whole thing up and the Republicans had a lot of candidates and they all had weaknesses.\"\n\nJane Merrick, CNN.com: \"In response to a man who treats his Presidency as if it's a series of a particularly bizarre reality-TV show, the entire White House press corps should walk out. Deny him coverage. Take him off the air. Cancel his series. Leave him to rage into Twitter's echo chamber, which is all he deserves. ... Senior White House officials disseminating lies and smears on social media \u2014 which are then lapped up by Trump supporters \u2014 in revenge against a journalist asking questions evokes George Orwell's '1984': 'The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears.

He said he viewed Long as troubled and kept his distance, adding that he told his wife to treat the young man carefully avoid any prolonged discussions.\n\n\u201cNo question in my mind that the guy was troubled,\u201d he said, adding that Ian Long\u2019s time in Afghanistan \u201cmade it worse.\u201d\n\nMcLeod said Long\u2019s role in the mass shooting fit his impressions. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not trust the guy.\u201d\n\nTim Tanner, who lives on the corner three houses away, said Long was someone who largely kept to himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen him a couple of times,\u201d he said. Long was easily identifiable when he drove around the neighborhood in his bright red pickup truck, which was still in the cordoned off driveway Wednesday.\n\nHe was a \u201cquiet, normal guy, kept to himself.\u201d\n\nThat \"normal\" characterization stands in contrast to a depiction by a former roommate of Long's who described him as a \"weird\" loner who could be aggressively anti-social.\n\n\u201cHe was kind of weird, he always locked himself in his room, he was always by himself,\u201d Blake Winnett, 35, told the New York Post. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know him very well.\u201d\n\nHe should have. Winnett and Long lived together on two occasions in 2012 and 2014, while Long was attending college in nearby Northridge. But Long apparently was purposefully standoffish.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to help anyone do anything, he was just lazy, I guess,\u201d Winnett recalled. When Long was once asked to take out the trash, he snarled, \u201cThat\u2019s not my (expletive) job.\"\n\nWinnett said he saw no evidence of violence from Long. Instead, he says his roommate often would disappear into the garage where he would practice dance moves for hours on end.\n\n\"He would close the garage and be playing music and dancing in there, like sweating,\" Winnett said. \"I would open the garage and would be like, \u2018What are you doing?'\u201d\n\nRun-ins with local police\n\nLocal authorities said they had periodic contact with Long over the years.\n\nHe was the victim of a battery at a local Thousand Oaks bar and also had been involved in two traffic accidents. Deputies were called to his home last year because of a domestic dispute, where he was \"somewhat irate and acting irrationally,\" said Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean.\n\nCLOSE Police confirm the Thousand Oaks shooting suspect was 28-year-old Marine Corps veteran Ian David Long. USA TODAY\n\nHowever, after mental health professionals observed Long, they decided not to pull him in for further observation, Dean said.\n\nNeighbors called to complain of loud noises earlier this year that sounded like he was damaging the house, neighbor Tom Hanson told local TV stations KTLA and KTTV.\n\n\"It sounded like he was tearing down the walls of the house,\" Hanson said.\n\nThe Marine Corps released a statement Thursday extending condolences to the victims and their families, noting that Long served from 2008 to 2013, including a 2010-11 stint in Afghanistan.

The dedication reads: \"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always. As long as I'm living, my baby you'll be. Love, Mom.\"\n\nAmong the other photos were some of Long in uniform and at the plate. A page dedicated to the player reported him as being 6-foot-1 and 170 pounds.\n\nLong's nickname is listed as Easy E, his batter-up song was \"Don't Stay\" by Linkin Park and his parents are listed as Colleen and David. He had no siblings.\n\nUnder \"Home Runs,\" Long had listed snowboarding, trucks, GRAW and winning. GRAW is a common acronym for Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, a tactical shooter video game. His favorite movie was listed as United 93, the story of the passengers trying to take control of the doomed hijacked plane on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nUnder \"Strikeouts,\" he cited work, Volkswagens and crashing.\n\nLong wrote that his plans after high school included college baseball and professional baseball. Under \"After Baseball,\" Long wrote \"Death.\"\n\nWhile Long's destiny wound up being the military and not the Major Leagues, he did seem to find some semblance of a normal life in June of 2009, when he wed Stavroula Tzavaras in Honolulu, Hawaii, according to court records.\n\nBut the marriage didn't endure. The couple separated in 2011, and finally divorced in 2013 citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nUltimately, whatever demons lived inside Long compelled him to dress Wednesday in a black, hooded outfit and load his legally purchased .45-caliber handgun that had an extended magazine for extra bullets that is illegal in California.\n\nLong then headed to the Borderline Bar & Grill in neighboring Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles, where he first shot security guards and then fired on hundreds of partiers who had gathered for the club's regular \"college night\" event.\n\nA sheriff's sergeant rushing to the scene to help was among those killed.

But print advertising and circulation revenue fell during the period, resulting in a decline in total publishing revenue to $616.4 million, from $660.3 million in the previous year.\n\n\"Our Publishing segment digital advertising and marketing services revenue growth slowed in the quarter, reflecting challenges within the local digital media category, in part due to the realignment of our sales organization,\" Gannett president and CEO Robert Dickey said in a statement accompanying the financial release. \"We expect the weaker results to continue into the fourth quarter and are therefore lowering our full year revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance.\"\n\n\n\nGannett cut its full-year revenue forecast to a range of $2.9 billion to $2.94 billion, compared to the previous range of $2.95 billion to $3 billion. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $325 million to $330 million is forecast, compared to prior guidance of $337 million to $345 million.\n\nThe company on Thursday reported net income of $13.4 million, or 11 cents on a per-share basis for the third quarter of 2018. That fell short of the $16.4 million expected, based on analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nNet income included $14.3 million of after-tax restructuring, asset impairment charges and other costs. Last year, Gannett reported net income of $23 million, or 20 cents on a per-share basis, for the period.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, Gannett reported a quarterly profit of 20 cents per share, compared to 16 cents a year ago. The result beat Wall Street's expectation of 17cents per share.\n\nTotal operating revenue for the quarter of $711.7 million declined 4 percent, compared $744.3 million in the prior year. Revenue fell short of the $723.6 million analysts had expected.\n\nTotal digital revenue increased 8.4 percent to $266.1 million, representing about 37 percent of total revenue. Digital-only subscribers increased 49 percent to about 472,000.\n\nThe USA TODAY Network increased its online readership, averaging 122 million unique visitors in the quarter, up 2 percent over the previous year, based on comScore data, Dickey said.\n\nPrint advertising declined 16.7 percent to $204 million, from $244.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Circulation fell 2.1 percent to $258.9 million.\n\nRevenue from local online marketing firm ReachLocal, acquired in July 2016 by Gannett, increased about 17 percent to $109.6 million.\n\nIn the current quarter, Gannett has instituted an early retirement program and undertaken two outsourcing initiatives \"within customer service and technology,\" chief financial officer Allie Engel said on a conference call with analysts after the company released its quarterly financials.\n\n\"We are making strong progress in our transformation to digital but the path to that goal will not always be smooth,\" Dickey said on the call. \"We are taking prudent steps, relative to our expense structure, and are focused on a strong future for Gannett.\u201d\n\nGannett (GCI) shares were down about 2.5 percent Thursday to $10.10.

USA TODAY\n\nImagine Dragons (Photo: Rich Lam / Getty Images)\n\nIt happened slowly, Imagine Dragons\u2019 transition from \u201cthe annoying band in all the movie trailers\u201d to \u201cthe slightly-less-annoying band whose song I won\u2019t change on the radio\u201d to \u201cthe band whose album I may listen to, voluntarily.\u201d\n\nThe band\u2019s journey to becoming one of the biggest rock bands of the decade, though, seemed to happen all at once. One day they were nobodies; the next, their 2013 breakthrough single \u201cRadioactive\u201d was everywhere, a process that repeated with \u201cBeliever,\u201d their 2017 single that seemingly appeared in every other blockbuster movie trailer that year. Their numerous Grammy nominations may fall in the rock category, but Imagine Dragons are even less a rock band than their Coldplay and Maroon 5 Top 40-radio brethren.\n\nInstead, their music takes the most emotive songwriting trends of 2010s music, all those moments in popular folk and pop and EDM songs designed to make the listener feel something, and packages them together. It\u2019s a Frankensteinian formula that, with its boot-stomping folk melodies and synth bloops over heavy beats and crashing choruses, sounds like an artificial-intelligence-generated representation of the music millennials are supposed to like.\n\nMore: How Imagine Dragons' faceless rock music became the genre's future\n\nAnd while this millennial fought against them for so long, considering Imagine Dragons the embodiment of everything boring about pop music right now, something changed over the past few years, culminating in the band\u2019s new release \u201cOrigins,\u201d its most listenable album yet. Maybe it\u2019s because nothing on the album is as tedious as \u201cBeliever,\u201d a song so painful that I banished the phrase \u201cfirst things first\u201d from my personal vocabulary on principle. While vocalist Dan Reynolds is still bellowing for dear life on initial singles \u201cNatural\u201d and \u201cMachine,\u201d the songs are less grating than their predecessors, especially the latter track\u2019s Foo Fighters-soundalike elements.\n\nThat\u2019s one knock I used to have on the band: that their music sounded like an amalgamation of all of the most unremarkable songs on Top 40 radio. And yet, listening to \u201cOrigins\u201d and hearing the various obvious soundalikes to other popular hits, I find myself preferring Imagine Dragons\u2019 versions to the ones they remind me of, like the band\u2019s \u201cOnly,\u201d which is a slightly more palatable version of the Chainsmokers\u2019 \u201cSomething Just Like This.\u201d Whether it\u2019s that Imagine Dragons improved or that the rest of the music on pop radio has all become indistinguishable, at some point, disliking the band on principle became harder to justify.\n\n\u201cOrigins\u201d is still very much an Imagine Dragons album, which means its predominant characteristics are its ersatz production, songwriting that is just decent enough not to be distractingly bad, and Reynolds\u2019 folksy croons that turn into throat-shredding wails when the tracks\u2019 choruses roll around. The tropes are still there, of course \u2013 the twangy treacle \u201cWest Coast,\u201d with a chorus that uses the entire left coast of the United States as a personality characteristic; a song \u201cDigital,\u201d about the plugged-in generation that\u2019s the \u201cface of the future\u201d; and the prerequisite closing track \u201cLove\u201d preaching unity.\n\nBut while \u201cOrigins\u201d does very few things differently from their last album, there were still moments that caught me by surprise, like the deliriously-\u201880s vibes of \u201cZero\u201d or the twinkling power ballad \u201cCool Out.\u201d And while its highlights aren't so frequent to elevate \"Origins\" to best-albums-of-2018 status, the album is listenable enough to delight fans, most likely, and to prompt some soul-searching from haters like me. And while I'm not quite converted into a Firebreather \u2013 which, yes, is a real thing Imagine Dragons superfans call themselves \u2013 the band's new album, to paraphrase a certain hit song that I'm still never going to like, has made me a believer.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/08/hated-imagine-dragons-until-their-new-album-changed-my-mind-origins/1920287002/", "", "", "", "Oscar-winning film composer Francis Lai, seen here in 2017, has died at 86, according to the French culture ministry.

It doesn't exclude the fact it happened.\n\n\"Our responsibility, in addition to shedding all the light on why it happened, will be to take measures to ensure it never happens again.\"\n\nBlanc told The AP a total of six players, spotted by the network outside Paris, were recruited to PSG's youth academy based on profiling criteria.\n\nHe repeated that neither he, nor any other member of management, knew such lists had been compiled by cells working independently of the club's knowledge.\n\nAccording to a report from the Mediapart news website earlier Thursday, PSG's non-Paris based scouts listed ethnic origins of potential recruits.\n\nMediapart and French TV program \"Envoye Special\" said a young black player was overlooked by PSG because of color.\n\nFollowing an investigation based on the \"Football Leaks\" documents, Mediapart alleged 17-year-old midfielder Yann Gboho, who plays for France's under-18s, was disregarded by PSG when he was 13, and the club's management decided to cover up \"those implicated in the scandal.\"\n\nPSG confirmed in a statement Thursday that forms with such illegal content relating to ethnicity were used by the department responsible for player scouting outside the Paris region.\n\nThe club launched an investigation after being made aware, by media consortium EIC, of the scouting files last month.\n\n\"They existed. These ethnic parameters were introduced through the individual incentive of this small group of scouts who operated outside of Paris, who operated in a closed circuit. We were not aware of this,\" Blanc explained. \"It happened and it's unacceptable.

We didn't have sufficient elements in hand to fire him three years ago. The existence of the lists was not known.\"\n\nAlthough PSG had not planned to speak directly with Gboho, who is now with first division Rennes, Blanc says discussions could take place.\n\n\"I think we'll meet this young player at some point in the next few weeks,\" Blanc said. \"We'll see if we meet him as part of the internal inquiry. For now it's not planned.\"\n\nOlivier Letang, PSG's sporting director at the time of the aforementioned lists, is now president of Rennes. He hired Westerloppe in January. Gboho signed professional forms this year.\n\nSeven years ago, French soccer was rocked by revelations from Mediapart that then-national team coach Laurent Blanc and others discussed informal quotas limiting black and Arab youth players' involvement in the national squad.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Viktoria Plzen faces Real Madrid in a Champions League group G soccer match on Wednesday. (AP Photo/Petr David Josek) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 When Real Madrid visits Celta Vigo on Sunday, interim coach Santiago Solari may have his last chance to convince the club that he should stay on the job.\n\nSolari has steered Madrid to three wins since he was promoted from reserve team last week to replace Julen Lopetegui with the team in slump and coming off a 5-1 rout by Barcelona.\n\nBy indicating Solari was taking over \"provisionally\", Madrid made it clear that it was still searching for a permanent replacement. Media speculation placed Antonio Conte, Roberto Martinez, Mauricio Pochettino, and even former Madrid coach Jose Mourinho on the list of high-profile candidates for the coveted job.\n\nNext week's international break could offer a new coach a window to adjust to the job. Madrid will have 12 days between matches. It returns with a game at Eibar before it visits Roma in a match that will likely decide who wins their Champions League group.\n\nIf Solari gets a win at Celta, the former Madrid midfielder would present a strong case that the right move is for the club is to do nothing at all.\n\n\"The only thing I can do is focus on our next game and that's fine with me. I can only see as far as the next link in the chain,\" Solari said after Wednesday's 5-0 win at Viktoria Plzen. \"Soccer is all about the here and now and the most important thing is your next game. We've come through this one with flying colors and we now have to think about our next match and focus all of our efforts and energy on it.\"\n\nSome of Madrid's most important players have backed him.\n\n\"We are doing well with him, he should stay until the end of the season,\" Madrid striker Karim Benzema said. \"He is a great coach. We are playing with more confidence.\"\n\nCasemiro added: \"People can talk about what he is, if someone else is coming, but we are treating him with a lot of respect, like the coach of Madrid. If things go well, why not give him the chance?\"\n\nAt a glance, it seems Solari has completely turned around a team that when he inherited it had won only one of its previous seven matches. With the Argentine directing the team, Madrid has outscored its three adversaries 11-0.\n\nBut a closer look shows that Solari may still have work to do to win the trust of club president Florentino Perez.\n\nA 4-0 win at third-division club Melilla is nothing to brag about considering the abyss separating the clubs in terms of talent.\n\nThe final score of a 2-0 home victory over Valladolid is deceptive since Valladolid twice hit the crossbar with the score 0-0 before Madrid finally broke through with less than 10 minutes to play.\n\nAnd the rout of Czech side Viktoria Plzen comes against the only team Madrid was able to beat in its final agonizing weeks under Lopetegui.\n\nSo on Sunday, Solari needs his team to avoid a repeat of its shaky performance against Valladolid and get a convincing win against a quality opponent. If not, the progress the team has made under him will be seriously questioned and the pressure will again be on the club to bring in an experienced coach.\n\nMadrid heads to northwestern Spain to face Celta in sixth place in the Spanish league standings, seven points behind leader Barcelona.\n\nCelta has had an irregular campaign and sits in 11th place, three points behind Madrid.\n\nHowever, Celta has only lost three times in 11 matches and is led by Iago Aspas. The Spain striker has scored eight goals this season, second only to Barcelona forward Luis Suarez with nine.\n\nCelta also recovered striker Maxi Gomez from injury in time for him to score twice in a 3-3 draw with Real Betis last week.\n\nLast year, Celta held Madrid to a 2-2 draw at Balaidos Stadium.\n\n\"It will be a difficult match,\" Aspas said. \"They have gone through several changes ... but they are still Real Madrid and have the best players in the world.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nSupreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (Photo: H.

Tests revealed she fractured three ribs on her left side, and she \"was admitted for observation and treatment,\" according to the court's statement.\n\nThe fall kept Ginsburg from attending Thursday's formal investiture ceremony for new Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The event attracted President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump, all other Supreme Court justices and leaders of Washington's legal community.\n\nGinsburg, the court's eldest justice, has served for 25 years after being appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. She is the leader of the court's liberal wing.\n\nShe is a medical warrior, having survived colon cancer in 1999, pancreatic cancer a decade later, a heart stent procedure in 2014 and a previous bout with broken ribs. She works out with a personal trainer twice weekly in the Supreme Court's gym to the beat of the PBS NewsHour.\n\nNews of her fall moved swiftly through Washington legal circles Thursday morning, including during and after Kavanaugh's investiture ceremony. Many Ginsburg fans offered support on Twitter.\n\nKnown for her work ethic, Ginsburg wrote the first opinion of the Supreme Court\u2019s term this year on age discrimination. The action marked the third consecutive year in which Ginsburg has written the first opinion of the term. Chief Justice John Roberts has remarked about Ginsburg\u2019s speedy delivery of opinions.\n\n'Feeling fine' at 85: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fends off retirement\n\nThis year, Ginsburg said she intended to stay on the bench for at least five more years.\n\n\"I'm now 85,\" Ginsburg said in July, according to CNN. \"My senior colleague, Justice John Paul Stevens, he stepped down when he was 90, so I think I have about at least five more years.\"\n\nGiven her age, some Democrats have expressed concerns about Ginsburg's health. President Trump has appointed two Supreme Court justices since taking office, and another opening on the bench could ensure conservative control of the court for decades. The Senate, which confirms justices, remains in Republican control after Tuesday's election.\n\n\"I pray for Ruth Bader Ginsburg every day,\" Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said Sunday. \"We cannot allow one more Supreme Court justice to be nominated and get through the Senate by this president, or we\u2019ll lose that court for over a generation.\"\n\nThe second woman appointed to the court \u2013 Justice Sandra Day O'Connor became the first in 1981 \u2013 Ginsburg is a legend among women's right advocates.

(AP Photo/Claude Paris) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 Djibril Sidibe stood totally still for several moments, staring blankly into the distance. Then his head dropped as he slipped deeper into self-reflection.\n\nThe forlorn image perfectly summed up Monaco's current predicament.\n\nMonaco, playing at home, had just been routed 4-0 in the Champions League. Not by Real Madrid, Liverpool or Juventus, but by Belgian team Club Brugge. It was Monaco's 15th straight game without a victory.\n\n\"I'm told after every game that it can't get any worse,\" Monaco coach Thierry Henry said, \"but it is.\"\n\nHenry, a former France great who is coaching for the first time in his career, has been in charge of the team for the last five of those winless matches.\n\nHenry arrived at Monaco, where he started his career as a teen, with limited experience as an assistant to Belgium coach Roberto Martinez, coaching strikers during the World Cup. After that, Henry left lucrative television deals to become Martinez's No. 2. Then the Monaco job came along after Leonardo Jardim was fired .\n\nHenry is hugely respected in soccer because of a stellar playing career which saw him win the World Cup and European Championship with France. He is also France and Premier League club Arsenal's record scorer.\n\nBut he came with no relevant coaching experience and it remains a surprising and risky choice for a struggling club to hire someone on name alone.\n\nHenry may have underestimated the difficulty of the task he faces. Because the level of confidence among his players is so low, he thinks they are not able to express themselves on the field.\n\n\"I think they're a little bit too aware of the situation,\" Henry said. \"When you don't win your tackles, it's hard to win a match. The team is affected mentally.\"\n\nHenry's plight has been compounded by injuries and problems with form.\n\nFirst-choice goalkeeper Danijel Subasic, who had a strong World Cup with runner-up Croatia, and midfielder Rony Lopes are sidelined. Lopes scored 15 league goals last season when he was the club's best player. Experienced forward Stevan Jovetic has hardly played because of injuries.\n\nAdditionally, striker Radamel Falcao is playing well below his best, while new signings Nacer Chadli and Aleksandr Golovin have yet to make their mark in midfield. Golovin has impressed in patches, but Chadli \u2014 a member of the Belgium team which reached the World Cup semifinals \u2014 has so far been poor.\n\nHenry has to somehow prepare his team to face Paris Saint-Germain, which will arrive at Stade Louis II on Sunday looking for a 13th straight league win.\n\nThat is not without some irony, considering PSG shares the record of 12 with Monaco.\n\nWhen Monaco won the league title in 2017, it enjoyed that winning run, reached the Champions League semifinals and scored more than 150 goals in a memorable campaign.\n\nThen the club sold the spine of its team, making huge profits but doing so at the expense of being competitive. That already showed at times last season, when Monaco finished 13 points behind PSG as runner-up.\n\nBut now things are immeasurably worse.\n\nThe club is 19th in the French league standings, eliminated from the Champions League and has only won one game in 17 matches so far.\n\nOne of the many defeats was a 4-0 loss to PSG in the French Super Cup, the season's curtain-raiser in early August.\n\n\"We're in a very negative spiral,\" said Sidibe, who won the World Cup with France in July. \"We have to set ourselves short-term objectives, first of all winning games and then staying up.\"\n\nBehind the scenes, too, things are increasingly agitated.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Monaco magistrate filed charges against Russian tycoon Dimitri Rybolovlev \u2014 the club's owner \u2014 and three other people following a probe into suspected corruption, money laundering and other crimes.\n\nTwo days earlier, Monaco issued a statement denying accusations it tried to bypass Financial Fair Play rules through a fake multi-million dollar contract with a marketing agency. According to Mediapart, Rybolovlev attempted to hide illegal funding behind a marketing contract involving an offshore structure of companies in the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.\n\nA Monaco team in crisis and facing a relegation fight seemed unfathomable a few months ago, but that is now a bleak reality on the sunny French Riviera.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Matt Stroshane)\n\n\u201cHey look! It\u2019s Disney,\u201d exclaimed a little girl as my family and I made our way along the Fountain Pot Trail in Yellowstone National Park. We were part of an Adventures by Disney tour group, and the girl was referring to the distinctive logo imprinted on the sign that one of our guides was carrying.\n\nRather than offering fanciful lands and attractions at theme parks that are based on real places, Adventures by Disney takes guests to actual places across the globe. Why, you might wonder, would Disney have branched off into the guided group tour business? The reaction of the little girl speaks volumes.\n\nThe Disney brand is widely recognized and the company\u2019s knack for storytelling makes it ideally suited to bring real-world adventures to life. And the special connection it has with children allows it to carve a niche in the underserved family tours market.\n\nAfter spending a week exploring Yellowstone and the Big Sky area of Montana with the Mouse, it\u2019s clear that Disney can deliver eTicket adventures without storybook castles, costumed characters or animatronic pirates.\n\nThe otherworldly vistas of Yellowstone\n\nThe initial part of the trip focused on Yellowstone, the first national park in the U.S. and the world, as well as one of the most popular. The tour included visits to most of the park\u2019s highlights, such as the otherworldly Grand Prismatic Spring with its stunning rainbow of vibrant colors, a hike overlooking the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone (who knew there was a Grand Canyon in northern Wyoming?) that included views of its mineral-infused, multi-hued waterfalls, and, of course, a stop at Old Faithful to see the celebrated geyser do its thing.\n\nAn early morning ride on the tour group\u2019s motorcoach through the Lamar Valley afforded many sightings of free-roaming bison, elk, antelope and other animals. We boarded horse-drawn, replica stagecoaches to help get a sense of the way visitors first traveled through Yellowstone in the late 1800s and early 1900s (and for the sheer fun of it). Accompanying us throughout the three days we visited the park was a local naturalist who provided expert insight and context.\n\nAs we were making our way just before dusk through the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces, a ghostly fog crept in that mixed with the sulfur-tinged plumes of steam from the springs. An unexpected thunderstorm then followed. What could have been a disappointing washout turned into a lively game of \u201cWordles\u201d thanks to Doug Littell, one of the tour\u2019s leaders. He quickly produced a homemade stash of cards with word puzzles on them and kept us engaged as we huddled in the eerie, fading light under the shelter of a large tree.\n\nThe Disney distinction\n\nTour leaders can make all the difference, and in Littell\u2019s case, he was key in making the trip wonderful. He was able to pivot and present an alternate activity that was suitable for and enjoyed by the participants, whether they were children, teens or parents. But Littell wasn\u2019t alone in making the trip hum along. He was joined by Lauren Milligan.\n\nA central Adventures by Disney distinction: It includes two tour leaders, dubbed \u201cadventure guides,\u201d for its trips. While it\u2019s not unprecedented for companies to assign two people to lead their tours, it is rare. With their winning personalities and other traits, Littell and Milligan were both ideally suited for the position.\n\n\u201cOne of us can be focused on the logistics of the tour, while the other guide is able to pay attention to things that other [companies\u2019] tour guides wouldn\u2019t notice,\u201d Littell says, explaining the benefits of two leaders. Thanks to the guides, plans for the trip unfolded seamlessly. But more critically, the doting attention they lavished on our group of about 30 participants made every family and each person feel welcome.\n\nOther Disney touches were subtler. Each day, participants received a pin custom-made for the trip and bearing the likeness of Mickey Mouse, Pluto or another animated character. Music from Disney movies or the parks, often reinterpreted with a country western arrangement befitting the Montana setting, played quietly during the bus rides.\n\nAs with any group travel, the Adventures by Disney trip offered pros and cons. On the one hand, nearly everything was arranged by the company and handled by the guides, which made the experience stress-free. But the trade-off was that participants didn\u2019t have much say in the arrangements. For example, I certainly wouldn\u2019t have chosen a 5:30 a.m. wake-up call, as we had for one of our days.\n\nGlamping and ranching\n\nLeft to our own travel-planning devices, my family probably never would have gone glamping either. But I\u2019m glad we did. Two nights in a large, safari-style tent under a gloriously starlit sky at Yellowstone Under Canvas in West Yellowstone, Montana, provided a great introduction to the burgeoning concept of \u201cglamorous\u201d camping.\n\nWith a comfortable, king-sized bed, a partitioned bathroom in the tent that had running water and hot showers, and a wood-burning stove, I suppose the accommodations were glamorous compared to standard camping. But with no electricity, king-sized mosquitoes, and \u2013 gasp! \u2013 no Wi-Fi signal, it wasn\u2019t glamorous by most standards. Still, staying at Yellowstone Under Canvas was a wonderful way to commune with the area\u2019s rugged beauty and was in keeping with the trip\u2019s ethos.\n\nTransitioning to the Big Sky area in Montana for the second half of the trip, the accommodations at the 320 Guest Ranch in Gallatin Gateway were more upscale, but there wasn\u2019t a fancy bathrobe to be found in the nicely appointed, but rustic, two-bedroom log cabin in which we stayed. There were, however, plenty of horses roaming the ranch.\n\n320\u2019s wranglers hosted a two-hour group horseback ride through mountain meadows that took us some 800 feet above the rambling ranch. The trails offered spectacular views of the valley and mountain peaks in the distance.\n\nOther activities included fly-fishing on the Gallatin River, a contemplative \u2013 and, it turns out, delightful \u2013 way to chill out that allowed me and my family members, novice anglers all, to each catch (and release) a fish. The action was zippier as we navigated the rapids of the Gallatin during a whitewater rafting expedition. The experience was surprisingly similar to river raft rides found at theme parks, such as Kali River Rapids at Walt Disney World\u2019s Animal Kingdom. The interactivity as well as the stakes were higher on Montana\u2019s \u201creal\u201d raft ride.\n\nOur group also participated in a thrilling zip line tour down Lone Mountain at the Big Sky Resort, a bike tour through a wooded trail, and a hike along the lovely Ousel Falls Park Trail. We were kept on the go with engaging activities, but none of them were especially strenuous or required much skill.\n\nAt the beginning of the trip, we were asked to make choices for some of the activities and meals. When I saw that one of the lunch options was a pre-made hoagie with a packet of Italian dressing, I had the sense that the tour would not be a gourmand\u2019s delight. Some of the food, in fact, was delicious, such as charcoal-grilled elk and huckleberry cobbler (the regional fruit is a popular ingredient in Montana) at the Mammoth Hotel Dining Room and the grilled vegetable salad with smoked chicken at the Bar N Ranch, which is adjacent to Yellowstone Under Canvas. For the most part, the meals were fine, if not especially memorable.\n\nAs with the accommodations, though, the trip was less about the food and more about experiencing the majesty of one of the country\u2019s most beautiful places. On that count, Disney succeeded wildly. \u201cIt\u2019s adventures by Disney, not vacations by Disney,\u201d says Littell, explaining the mission for the Montana tour.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2018/11/08/adventures-disney-tour-yellowstone-montana-wyoming/1923798002/", "CLOSE The world famous Harlem Globetrotters dropped by Warriors practice to teach Steph Curry and Quinn Cook three-man weaves and 4-point shots.

Realmuto then doubled in a run and Rosario added two more on a single as the MLB squad scored five runs in the inning to take a 7-0 lead.\n\nRealmuto also hit an opposite-field solo homer in the fifth to make it 8-3.\n\nAfter the game, Realmuto got to experience a Japanese baseball tradition when he was invited on the field to take part in the \"hero interview\" in front of the Tokyo Dome crowd.\n\n\"This is awesome, we don't do this in the United States so I'm really excited to be here with you guys,\" Realmuto said. \"Hopefully, I can keep hitting well and be here with you again.\"\n\nThe highlight for the home fans came in the fourth when Seiya Matsubara's sinking liner split the gap between Ronald Acuna Jr. and Soto in left-center field.\n\nBy the time Acuna retrieved the ball and got it back into the infield, Matsubara had raced around the bases for a three-run inside-the-park home run that cut the MLB stars' lead to 7-4.\n\nThe series begins Friday with three games on consecutive nights in Tokyo followed by one game in Hiroshima on Tuesday and two games in Nagoya on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nDuring the series, pitchers will not be allowed to throw more than 80 pitches per game. If a pitcher throws more than 50 pitches, he must have four days of rest before being able to throw in another game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Bach has given his blessing for Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo's bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics to move forward without funding from the Italian government. (AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nROME (AP) \u2014 IOC President Thomas Bach gave his blessing Thursday for the joint Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics to move forward without funding from the Italian government.\n\nThe candidacy is being supported exclusively \u2014 financially at least \u2014 by the regional governments of Lombardy and Veneto.\n\n\"This candidature is very strong because it reflects the reforms of Olympic Agenda 2020,\" Bach said at the conclusion of two days of meetings in Rome. \"The guarantees which have been expressed by Lombardy and Veneto are very important to secure the overall candidature. That is well appreciated by the IOC.\"\n\nItaly Deputy Premier Luigi Di Maio said last month that the government will send a letter of support for the bid to the International Olympic Committee \"but as government we won't provide 1 euro \u2014 neither for direct nor indirect costs.\"\n\nFunding from federal governments has always been one of the keys for Olympic bids but Agenda 2020, Bach's wide-ranging reform package passed in 2014, allows for more flexible rules.\n\nLombardy and Veneto are two of Italy's most affluent regions.\n\nBach said that government undersecretary and sports delegate Giancarlo Giorgetti assured him that Italy \"is ready to deliver the guarantees about free entry and security which would be needed from the federal government.\"\n\nBach also met with Italian President Sergio Mattarella.\n\n\"We are leaving Rome and Italy with much more confidence about this candidature,\" Bach said. \"We really see things coming along.\"\n\nCalgary and Stockholm, the other two cities bidding for the 2026 Games, have more serious funding issues.\n\nCalgary's town council voted in favor of its bid this week but on condition that it can secure satisfactory funding to cover operational costs of the games.\n\nThe local government in Stockholm, too, has balked at spending taxpayer money on the event.\n\nThe host will be selected by the IOC in a vote on June 24 in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nAnother potential hurdle for the Italian bid rose recently when the ruling coalition led by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and right-wing League party suggested it is considering taking over the distribution of financial funding for sports from the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI).\n\nUnder current conditions, CONI decides how to divide the more than 400 million euros ($450 million) in annual funding from the government between the various national sports federations. If the function is removed, it would greatly reduce CONI's power.\n\n\"Clearly finding a solution to this issue has taken precedent over everything else,\" CONI president Giovanni Malago said.\n\nAdded Bach: \"After the talks with CONI and with the undersecretary Giorgetti, I'm very confident there will be a solution found which will be in the interests of Italy and the interests of sport.\"\n\nThe Milan-Cortina bid was originally slated to be a three-pronged candidacy including Turin, which hosted the 2006 Winter Games. But infighting led to Turin being dropped.\n\nUnder the revised plan, hockey and speedskating \u2014 which had been slotted for venues built for the 2006 Turin Games \u2014 would be held in Milan along with the opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nAlpine skiing would be held in 1956 host Cortina, while biathlon would be slated for nearby Anterselva \u2014 a regular stop on the biathlon World Cup circuit.\n\nOther snow sports could be held in Bormio, north of Milan, while ski jumping could be held at an existing facility in Predazzo, which would mean involving a third region \u2014 Trentino-Alto Adige.\n\nItaly is anxious to bring a bid through the entire process after two Rome candidacies were withdrawn.\n\nTwo years ago, Italy was forced to end Rome's bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics because of staunch opposition from the city's mayor. And in 2012, then-premier Mario Monti scrapped the city's bid for the 2020 Olympics because of financial concerns.\n\nWhen asked if the IOC had a backup plan if all three of the 2026 bids withdraw, Bach responded: \"The answer is no.\"\n\nAmid reports that Buenos Aires and Ushuaia, Argentina, are interested in formulating a 2026 bid, Bach rejected re-opening the race.\n\n\"We are in the race for 2026 and we will not change the rules in the middle of the race,\" he said. \"On the other hand, we are very happy to see already now there is good interest to host the Winter Games in 2030. We have a number of notifications from national committees interested.\"\n\nBach said there is also plenty of interest for the 2032 Summer Games\n\n\"This is a clear demonstration of the appeal and relevance of the Olympic Games,\" Bach said, \"and confidence in the way the IOC is undertaking its reforms to organize the Olympic Games in the future.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Eric Buschow of the Ventura County Sheriff's Office said Helus was a \"true cop's cop,\" enthusiastic and excited about his work in law enforcement.\n\n\"He loved spending time with his son,\" said Buschow. \"They would go fishing up in the Sierras together.

He heard of Helus's death when scrolling through Facebook and seeing multiple posts of a Ventura County Sheriff's badge with a black band over it, the sign of a fallen officer. When Mayorga heard it was Helus who died, and that it happened when Helus rushed inside to try to save someone, he was devastated but not surprised.\n\nMultiple friends of Sheriff Sgt.

When people call him a 'cop's cop,' what they're saying is that he was the type of cop who other cops looked up to, someone who goes beyond what a normal cop does.\"\n\nMayorga met Helus in 1990 after transferring to Ventura. At that point, Mayorga already had seven years on the job, but he found Helus's energy and enthusiasm contagious.\n\n\"It was just refreshing to see someone so gung-ho and wanting to do his job well,\" Mayorga said. \"It made me smile. Later on, when we were working patrol you would see a lot of young people go up and ask him questions, pick his brain because they just trusted him. He was a mentor for a lot of young officers.\"\n\nAccording to his Facebook page, Helus owned and operated Gun Control: Firearms Training and CCW Instruction, a private business that trained civilians on how to safely own and operate a weapon. On his \"about\" page, Helus wrote that he'd been a firearms instructor for more than 25 years, and had previously worked with the basic and advanced SWAT schools.\n\nJordan Slider, who works with Ron's son, Jordan Helus, has known the family since Slider and Jordan Helus's freshman year at Cal Lutheran University.

(Photo: Bob Donnan, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIt\u2019s Week 10 in the NFL, which means that individual player awards are up for grabs, playoff races are tightening and potential coaching changes could be on the horizon for sputtering franchises.\n\nHere are seven questions for Week 10:\n\n1. Could Thursday night feature a potential Super Bowl preview?\n\nEven without Le\u2019Veon Bell, whose absence has stretched into Week 10, the Steelers have been hot over the past month and look like one of the top teams in the AFC. The Panthers, meanwhile, have made a dramatic jump on offense from last season thanks to coordinator Norv Turner. Specifically, quarterback Cam Newton is having a transformative season in which he\u2019s using his arm (career-high 100.8 passer rating) and his legs (on pace to set a new career-high for rushes).\n\nBoth teams could be threats to represent their conferences in the Super Bowl, but who needs this game more? It\u2019s probably Carolina given the strength of their conference and the need to match the play of the NFC South-leading Saints. While a loss wouldn\u2019t be devastating for either team, this is a matchup worth watching, and one that could be reprised in February.\n\nMore: NFL QB Hot Sheet: Saints' Drew Brees builds case for MVP\n\n2. How will the Rams bounce back?\n\nLos Angeles suffered its first loss in a thrilling game against the Saints, but there's no reason for panic. The Rams still look like one of the top teams in the entire NFL, though a tough division matchup against the Seahawks at home looms. With both L.A. and New Orleans having one loss, how each team responds will shape the race for home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. The Rams, behind running back Todd Gurley, have the NFL\u2019s third-ranked scoring offense (33.2 points a game), but the Seahawks are tied for fifth in scoring defense (19.5). The Rams are the clear favorite, but historically this is usually a physical, hard-fought game.\n\n3. Will the Saints extend their NFL-best seven-game winning streak?\n\nSpeaking of the Saints, they made their case as the NFL\u2019s best team with their victory against the Rams, but now have a challenging tilt against the 5-3 Bengals, who are fresh off their bye. Cincinnati ranks 10th in scoring offense (27.6 points a game), but the big question is whether that will be enough to keep up with the potent Saints attack that ranks second (34.9). Drew Brees is playing at an MVP level. Michael Thomas is one of the best receivers in football. Alvin Kamara is a do-it-all threat, and the defense is much improved. New Orleans also just brought in veteran receiver Dez Bryant, though it's likely a stretch for him to play Sunday.\n\nMore: Throw up the X: Dez Bryant addition shows Saints are all-in on Super Bowl push\n\nMore: Cowboys' Jason Garrett 'happy' for Dez Bryant after reports of WR's deal with Saints\n\n4. Is this the start of an end zone hot streak for Julio Jones?\n\nIt took 343 days, came on Jones\u2019 60th catch of the season and followed six other Falcons recording a receiving score, but Jones finally made it into the end zone with a 35-yard touchdown in Week 9 against the Redskins. Now facing the Browns on Sunday, he could be in line for even more, though history is not on his side. Over the past 29 games, Jones has caught 180 passes for 2,816 yards, but only five of them (or 2.8 percent) were finished in the end zone. Browns rookie corner Denzel Ward has been excellent but suffered a hip injury in Week 9. If he\u2019s good to go, he may shadow Jones all game long.\n\n5. Will Greg Williams defy the odds to get his first win as the Browns interim coach?\n\nWilliams isn\u2019t getting any favors from the schedule. In his first test since the Browns fired Hue Jackson, he watched his team getting scorched by the AFC-leading Chiefs. Now on Sunday, he\u2019ll look to get his first win against a Falcons team that has won three in a row and boasts one of the most productive league's offenses behind quarterback Matt Ryan, who has a career-high completion rate of 70.8 percent. To make matters even more challenging, the Falcons just signed pass rusher Bruce Irvin, whose familiarity with Dan Quinn\u2019s system from their days in Seattle means he could step in right away.\n\n6. Who will take the battle for second place in the NFC East?\n\nA pivotal matchup Sunday night in Philadelphia between the 4-4 Eagles and the 3-5 Cowboys could have significant implications in the division race. The Redskins are 5-3 but dealing with a rash of injuries, so there's room for a challenger to emerge. Philadelphia is still finding its footing in its Super Bowl title defense. But the Cowboys have been an ineffective offense and are coming off a disappointing defeat against the Titans despite new target Amari Cooper providing a boost. But if it isn\u2019t enough, and if quarterback Dak Prescott and offense don\u2019t turn it around, jobs on the coaching staff could be in danger.\n\nMore: Eagles' Jason Kelce has no love for Cowboys, says he's never liked what they stand for\n\nMore: Troy Aikman says Cowboys are dysfunctional, recommends 'a complete overhaul'\n\n7. With Leonard Fournette trending toward a return, can Jaguars snap four-game skid?\n\nJacksonville has badly missed Fournette, who has dealt with a nagging hamstring injury all season long. This season, the Jags rank 24th in rushing offense (95 yards a game) after they ranked first in the category last season (141.4). That has put more pressure on quarterback Blake Bortles, who has not delivered consistently. The Jaguars just had their bye week, so they\u2019ve had time to examine some of their issues \u2013 in addition to getting the chance to give Fournette some extra rest. He has returned to practice this week, and if he can go, will give the offense a much-needed boost. With the ascending Colts waiting for them Sunday, they\u2019ll need to be better.\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.", "Washington Redskins quarterback Alex Smith (11) is sacked by Atlanta Falcons defensive tackle Grady Jarrett (97) in the first quarter at FedEx Field.

Speedy receiver Paul Richardson is also on the shelf, requiring surgery on an injured shoulder.\n\nBut the O-line is the main concern. Among the 13 players on Wednesday's injury report were starting tackles Trent Williams (thumb) and Morgan Moses (knee).\n\nThe Redskins went into scramble mode Monday, signing veteran linemen Luke Bowanko, Jonathan Cooper and Austin Howard to fill the open roster spots. Rookie tackle Geron Christian is another option. Asked if it was too early to project a front five for the upcoming contest at Tampa Bay, Washington coach Jay Gruden seemed to restrain a smirk.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said in a clipped response. \"It is. Quite early.\"\n\nGruden conducted the walkthrough in order to get his new players more mental reps as they get familiarized with the plays and teammates. He said a walkthrough provides roughly 80 reps while a standard Wednesday practice typically provides about 35.\n\nMoses and Bowanko started next to each other at the University of Virginia before going pro in 2014 and could provide some element of instant chemistry on and off the field. Bowanko was surrounded by reporters in the locker room when Moses ambled over to crash his interview.\n\n\"Just telling them how handsome you are,\" Bowanko quipped.\n\nMoses walked away grinning.\n\nGruden seemed hopeful Moses could return against the Bucs while signalling Cooper, a sixth-year journeyman, will likely plug in at left guard.\n\n\"Just a matter of hitting the ground running, getting in that playbook, staying in the film room, staying after (practice) on the field and just trying to get as much done as quickly as possible,\" said Howard, who has started 88 NFL games, of the crash course.\n\nThe Redskins even seemed to get a little sympathy from the Buccaneers \u2014 if only a little.\n\n\"I think the closest thing is when I was in Atlanta one year, we lost three O-linemen in a game and we played the whole fourth quarter with a tight end at right tackle. I think that's every coach's worst nightmare, especially on game day where you only have 46 guys up and usually only seven O-linemen,\" said Tampa Bay coach Dirk Koetter. \"That's crazy as an offensive coach, I've been in their shoes and it's not fun.\n\n\"I think the kind of guys that they signed \u2014 guys that are veteran players who have started at other places. I've seen it done before and I think based on who you are signing and what kind of experience they have, it can definitely be done.

I\u2019m not sure the Carolina defense is good enough to stop the Steelers from scoring, but they\u2019ll score enough to cover this one.\n\nCharles: Steelers\n\nThat\u2019s a really, really tough spread. It factors in that the Steelers are the better team, but the Panthers are on fire and it\u2019s a short week for both teams coming off big wins.

The Redskins will get their running game going, and when that happens, they tend to win. I also like this matchup for their defense. Greg Manusky\u2019s scheme is the type that tends to give Fitz, um, fits.\n\nCharles: Redskins\n\nThis feels like a knee-jerk line in response to an absolute stinker the Redskins put together last week. I still don\u2019t believe in the Bucs\u2019 defense and Washington will be stingy against Ryan Fitzpatrick.\n\nSaints at Bengals (+3)\n\nSteven: Saints\n\nNew Orleans is the best team in the league, in my opinion. I also believe they have the best offense in the league, which a much cooler take. The Bengals defense has struggled of late, so I could see the Saints putting up too many points for Andy Dalton to keep up.\n\nCharles: Saints\n\nIt\u2019ll be a shootout, but we\u2019re talking about one of the top-three teams in the NFL in the Saints. The line should be higher, so I\u2019ll take advantage by backing New Orleans.\n\nFalcons at Browns (+4.5)\n\nSteven: Falcons\n\nLike I said at the top of this post: I\u2019m not backing the Browns any more this season. This team is still a mess after the Hue Jackson firing, and I do not have confidence in Gregg Williams to solve its problems.\n\nCharles: Falcons\n\nDeion Jones might be back, Bruce Irvin is now a member of the Dirty Birds and the Browns are still the Browns.\n\nJaguars at Colts (-2.5)\n\nSteven: Colts\n\nI am now fully convinced the Jaguars are the worst team in the AFC South. The offense is obviously playing poorly, and the defensive coaching staff isn\u2019t getting the most out of the team\u2019s tremendous talent. Frank Reich should be able to scheme the Colts to enough points to win this one comfortably.\n\nCharles: Colts\n\nStill not trusting Blake Bortles, still trusting Andrew Luck will dink and dunk his way to a win at home. Colts 17, Jaguars 13\n\nCardinals at Chiefs (-17)\n\nSteven: Cardinals\n\nAm I really doing this again? Am I picking against the Chiefs against one of the worst teams in the league? I guess so. That\u2019s just too many points to lay against an NFL team. Kansas City 35, Arizona 20.\n\nCharles: Chiefs\n\nKansas City just beat the Browns by 16, so I guess Vegas basically made that the over/under? I\u2019ll take the over.\n\nBills at Jets (-7)\n\nSteven: Bills\n\nSo Nathan Peterman is a terrible quarterback, but it\u2019s not like Josh McCown, who is likely to start for the injured Sam Darnold, is some world beater. And he\u2019s going against a pretty good defense.\n\nCharles: Jets\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that Sam Darnold is out. Nate Peterman is still the Bills\u2019 QB. That\u2019s it.\n\nPatriots at Titans (+7)\n\nSteven: Patriots\n\nThe Titans defense leads the league in points allowed, but I think we\u2019re about to see the Patriots go on one of those runs they typically go on around this time of year. Bill Belichick will come up with a gameplan that gets Marcus Mariota out of his comfort zone.\n\nCharles: Patriots\n\nTennessee\u2019s defense is really tough, but I can\u2019t get past Bill Belichick scheming his way into Marcus Mariota regressing from Monday\u2019s win over the Cowboys.\n\nChargers at Raiders (+11)\n\nSteven: Chargers\n\nThe Raiders were already bad before losing Amari Cooper and Burce Irvin. Now they\u2019re even worse, and the Chargers are one of the hottest teams in the league. Philip River should be in for a monster day, so I have no problem laying the 11 points.\n\nCharles: Chargers\n\nAnd now, a brief statement:\n\nDolphins at Packers (-10.5)\n\nSteven: Dolphins\n\nThe Packers offense is just too flawed \u2014 even with Aaron Rodgers behind center \u2014 for me to trust them to cover a 10.5-point spread.\n\nCharles: Packers\n\nNot backing Brock Osweiler on the road against Aaron Rodgers. Nope.\n\nSeahawks at Rams (-6.5)\n\nSteven: Rams\n\nYes, the Rams struggled to beat the Seahawks in the first matchup, but that was in Seattle, where the Seahawks are a much different team. Los Angeles is coming off its first loss, so I expect the team to have plenty of juice for this one.\n\nCharles: Seahawks\n\nHave you noticed the Rams have won three games in the past five weeks by three points or fewer? And that they\u2019re facing a division rival who lost to them by just two points the last time they met? Seattle keeps it within a touchdown in a loss.\n\nCowboys at Eagles (-7)\n\nSteven: Eagles\n\nI really think this one will end up being the last straw for Jason Garrett in Dallas. I can see it getting out of hand with the Eagles defensive line dominating the Cowboys offensive line.\n\nCharles: Eagles\n\nI put my faith Dallas\u2019s defense last week and it didn\u2019t get me anywhere. This week? I know the Eagles\u2019 secondary can be vulnerable but I just don\u2019t have it in me to take the points in a must-win for Philly.\n\nGiants at 49ers (-2.5)\n\nSteven: 49ers\n\nI have complete faith in Kyle Shanahan here. I have absolutely no faith in Eli Manning.\n\nCharles: 49ers\n\nHow did it come to this, when I feel more comfortable betting on undrafted Nick Mullens than on Eli Manning? This is me right now:", "CLOSE Americans are keeping tabs on how much money they spend. Veuer's Natasha Abellard has the story. Buzz60\n\nAlmost 10 years into the economic expansion, many Americans still face significant personal financial pressures. (Photo: Avosb / Thinkstock)\n\nIt's not supposed to be this way.\n\nAlmost 10 years into the economic expansion, many Americans still face significant personal financial pressures. Though there have been signs of progress, benefits from the economic rebound have been uneven and not widely shared.\n\nSome observations:\n\nWellness gains visibility\n\nAmericans are having trouble saving money on their own, so more people are looking to their employer for assistance \u2013 and employers seem up for the challenge.\n\nMetLife earlier this year asked whether employers have a responsibility for the financial well-being of their workers. Some 50 percent of workers said yes, as did 59 percent of employers. Workers also expressed interest in comprehensive financial-wellness plans that include not just things such as 401(k) matching funds but more workshops and planning sessions on a range of topics including paying down debt, budgeting, saving and more.\n\nMore: Things people seem to fear financially are not always worth worrying about\n\n\"It's about giving people the skills and tools to tackle the things they're thinking about every day,\" said Pat Moran of the Scottsdale, Arizona-based American Financial Literacy Institute, which conducts wellness workshops in the workplace. Many people always have been interested in such topics, but now employers are recognizing their importance \u2013 partly as a means to boost productivity, he said.\n\nA separate Fidelity Investments study found financial worries rank among the top causes of stress among workers, with saving for the future and paying off debt among the primary challenges. Employee debt issues are linked to lower productivity including higher rates of absenteeism, and even health problems, the study found.\n\nFidelity's own workplace wellness program includes helping employees develop a personal action plan that covers topics such as benefits, debt management, investing, insurance and estate planning. The process helps workers assess where they stand, identify challenges and set priorities and goals.\n\nUneven pace of recovery\n\nLower-income households have been seeing fewer positives from the strong economy despite nearly full employment. Many are just treading water, or worse.\n\nOf people earning less than $30,000 a year, 78 percent of respondents in a September Bankrate.com survey said their financial situation hasn't improved over the past two years, and a sizable slice said it has worsened. To no great surprise, financial stress eases for people higher up the income ladder. Among those earning $75,000 or more, for example, 54 percent said they are feeling better about their finances.\n\n\"The broader U.S. economy has continued to improve compared to two years ago just before Donald Trump was elected president,\" Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst for Bankrate.com, said in a statement. \"However, the average American tells us they\u2019re not feeling the improvement in their own wallet.\"\n\nMore: Many people are working in jobs that lack key protections against discrimination\n\nAmericans ages 65 and up reported the lowest rate of financial improvement of any generation, while millennials ages 28 to 37 reported the most improvement. Also, men more than women said they're doing better now than before.\n\nResults from the survey of more than 1,000 adults provide a wake-up call, given that the economy overall is strong, with consistent job gains and still-mild inflation and interest rates. The current environment certainly provides more opportunities to advance than a recession would. \"Individuals should strive to save more money and pay down, or pay off, debt while they still can,\" Hamrick said.\n\nHealth care top benefit\n\nMany employers are expanding their range of benefits \u2013 including things such as legal assistance and pet insurance, but health coverage still ranks at the top. In fact, respondents in a new survey said they considered health care the most critical issue facing the nation \u2013 and a key component affecting their own financial wellness.\n\nIn a survey of more than 1,000 workers by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 26 percent of workers ranked health care as the most important issue, ahead of immigration, the role of the federal government, jobs and other topics.\n\nAlmost three in four respondents cited health insurance among the three most important benefits factoring into their own decisions to stick with a job or look for a new one.\n\nMore: Year-end planning: Here are 5 tax, investment, job and debt questions you need to ponder\n\nThe survey also revealed that employees generally are concerned about and dissatisfied with their health insurance, especially noncovered expenses.\n\nNearly one-quarter of respondents said health cost hikes led them to cut contributions to 401(k)-style plans, and nearly one-third reported having trouble paying for necessities such as food, housing and utilities. On the plus side, health costs have encouraged some workers to try to take better care of themselves, choose generic drugs more often and visit the doctor only for serious conditions and symptoms, the survey found.\n\nPart of the problem is that health care expenses continue to escalate. Costs have been rising for most Americans, regardless of how they receive coverage, Moody's Investors Service said in a report. That includes workers with employer-provided health insurance. Roughly half the people in this group have seen premiums and other out-of-pocket costs increase faster than wages over the past decade, which Moody's said partly reflects the trend toward high-deductible plans.\n\nReviewing investing basics\n\nGiven that so many people aren't good at saving money \u2013 and many don't have any investments to their names \u2013 it's perhaps wise to review fundamental strategies from time to time.\n\nChristina Kilroy, vice president of the Investment Company Institute Education Foundation, did this in a recent blog. Some of the suggestions are quite rudimentary, such as simply making an effort to enroll in a 401(k) plan \u2013 and making sure you contribute enough to trigger employer matching funds.\n\nIf you don't have access to a retirement plan at work, don't use that as an excuse not to save and invest. Anyone with job-related income may open up an Individual Retirement Account. Anyone with any money can invest in various tax-managed mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. These vehicles don't offer tax deductions but still can be good choices considering that any long-term capital gains would be taxed less severely than the ordinary-income rates that apply on IRAs and 401(k) withdrawals.\n\nAs another suggestion, Kilroy urges workers to beware leakage in their retirement accounts when changing jobs or otherwise leaving a place of employment. If you cash out of a 401(k) account, ordinary taxes and a 10 percent penalty (if under age 59\u00bd) could whittle down your balance. It's better to roll over or transfer the money to another retirement account, especially a new IRA, to minimize or avoid the tax bite.\n\nReach Wiles at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8616.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/columnist/2018/11/08/personal-finance-skills-saving-money-remains-challenging-many/1830324002/", "CLOSE Following a summer of record heat, research projects heat waves will become deadlier over the next 30 years. Veuer's Justin Kircher has the story. Buzz60\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a U.N. body, released a report in late 2018 highlighting the importance of keeping global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. To date, average global temperatures have already increased by 1\u00b0C. The report details how much worse the effects of global climate change would be should temperatures increase by 2.0\u00b0C celsius or higher. The IPCC press release states that limiting global warming to a 1.5\u00b0C increase -- about 2.7\u00b0F -- \u201cwould require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.\u201d Indeed, climate scientists estimate it would require massive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions almost immediately, and zero global emissions by 2050. The global community is nowhere near to making that goal a reality, particularly as the United States, one of the largest carbon emitters, has announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord, which it will do in 2020. Many experts are saying that the globe is already locked in at a 2.0\u00b0C increase, the point at which the consequences will become much more severe. But should a major change occur in the immediate future and global warming is halted at that 1.5\u00b0C target, it is important to note that this does not mean the effects of global climate change on the Earth and its population will not be serious. Already, the approximately 1.0\u00b0C increase has had severe impacts on the globe\u2019s weather, sea levels, and ecosystems. When 1.5\u00b0C is reached, which could happen as early as 12 years from now, the impacts, as determined by scientists and experts around the world, are projected to be disastrous. 24/7 Wall St. consulted reports by groups such as the IPCC, NASA, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association, the U.S. Global Change Research Program, and more, to identify the effects of global warming that either have already taken place, or will occur even if warming is limited to a 1.5\u00b0C increase.

You might as well believe that someone, somewhere, is working around the clock to break into your accounts and steal your money, your identity and anything else you have. Because it\u2019s essentially true.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve taken precautions. You use security software. You have set up your router\u2019s security so hackers cannot access every device on your network, get your passwords or use your systems as a bot in their attacks.\n\nAfter you do that, you\u2019re far from done. Hackers are smart and always on the move.\n\nHere are five simple solutions to protect your business, your nest egg and your future.\n\nDon\u2019t make these common mistakes with passwords\n\nIt may seem obvious that you need a strong password to keep hackers from accessing your private information and financial reports. Millions of people are sitting ducks because of insecure passwords like 12345678 or Password. They also use the same password for multiple sites.\n\nThe ground rules for passwords are: 1) It has to contain a random collection of letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers and symbols; 2) It has to be eight characters or longer; and 3) You have to create a unique password for every account.\n\nThat\u2019s a tall order. While something like \u201cTl|_|,BwwB2R\u201d is really strong, it isn\u2019t easy to remember. Or is it? Let me show you how I came up with it.\n\nStart by thinking up a random sentence. You can use a catchphrase, quote or even a song lyric. I chose a lyric from a Bruce Springsteen song: \u201cTramps like us, baby we were born to run.\u201d\n\nI took the first character from each word to get \u201ctlu,bwwbtr\u201d. Not bad, but it could be better. So, I added some symbols in place of similar letters. U becomes |_|, the \u201cto\u201d from the original lyric becomes 2.

Here's what to do. USA TODAY\n\nMake it harder for hackers to crack the code\n\nHackers can quickly figure out your password, but they can\u2019t figure out the secret, one-time code that your bank texts to you. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a powerful security method because hackers would have to physically steal your phone, enter the correct password, and then enter that secret code.\n\nIn the wake of large-scale hacks, most major accounts offer two-factor authentication, from social media to banks.\n\nKeep track of all your pennies\n\nMost of us have at least one bank account (and often more) plus credit accounts, PayPal and other depositories for our money. These can be hard to keep track of, especially when you have additional investments and personal savings goals.\n\nIt\u2019s easier to keep track of your business finances if all these accounts are aggregated in one place, right in front of your eyes.\n\nMore: Equifax data breach: How to protect yourself beyond a credit freeze\n\nThese days that means an app like Intuit\u2019s Mint.

If you see anything suspicious on them, like credit card accounts that you didn\u2019t open, you can alert whichever credit bureau is reporting it, whether it\u2019s Experian, Equifax or TransUnion.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s easier than ever to check your credit report. You can check free sites like the Discover credit card site, which says, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be our customer, and there\u2019s no ding to your credit.\u201d\n\nThe important thing is to check your credit reports. You should start with the three credit bureaus, each of which gives you one free credit report every year.\n\nFreeze your credit\n\nYou may have heard financial advisers telling people to freeze their credit. But you may not know why they\u2019re suggesting that.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple overview.

Jones/Athens Banner-Herald via AP)\n\nFinally, the midterm elections are over. Turnout was the highest in 50 years. After months of election prognostication, Americans have finally had their say. Although the issues that drove citizens to the polls across the country varied, the core message to elected officials was the same \u2014 end the political bickering in Washington and start working for the people.\n\nWhile the federal government has proceeded from nearly intractable gridlock into angry, partisan-driven paralysis, governors of both parties have been charting a different course. And this week, Americans leveraged their sacred right to vote to elect one of the most diverse classes of governors in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nThe states\u2019 leaders now count among themselves Michelle Lujan Grisham, who became New Mexico\u2019s first Democratic Latina governor, Oklahoma\u2019s winning outsider candidate Kevin Stitt, Colorado\u2019s Governor-elect Jared Polis, the first openly gay governor in America, Tennessee businessman turned governor-elect Bill Lee, and Kansas\u2019 Laura Kelly, who becomes only the third woman to occupy the governor\u2019s office in state history. Each one of these champions have demonstrated that the door to the executive office is open for all.\n\nGovernors show bipartisanship across America\n\nNewly elected Governor Gretchen Whitmer also joined the record number of women running for office this year. A Democrat who rose from the Michigan Senate, Whitmer was recognized as indispensable to many programs introduced by her Republican predecessor, Rick Snyder. By a nine point margin, constituents clearly approved of her commitment to bipartisanship.\n\nIn this, she shares a lot with sitting governors, such as Republican Phil Scott in progressive Vermont and Steve Bullock, a Democrat beloved in his conservative-leaning Montana. Bullock is also the National Governors Association Chair and has launched his Chair\u2019s Initiative, \u201cGood Jobs for All Americans.\u201d The program builds on his successes expanding opportunity with popular programs like an apprenticeship tax credit, which helped make \u201cearn while you learn\u201d positions available in almost 1,000 occupations across his home state.\n\nMore: Flashback \u2014 Trump political protection plan is replace Sessions with Mueller saboteur\n\nTwo more years of this? Donald Trump spars with media during press conference\n\nElection results 2018: Forget the blue wave and behold the purple puddle\n\nOn a national level, Governor Bullock is now engaging with his colleagues to address economic and social transformations and technological advancements, which are fueling growth but also driving real fears of job displacement. To ensure we don\u2019t leave Americans behind as work and workplaces evolve, governors are now grappling together with how to prepare employees for jobs that don\u2019t yet exist, and roll out innovations to give workers from all backgrounds an equal shot at a better life.\n\nFuture opportunity must, however, begin with quality, safe educational experiences for our youth, and school safety is a priority for all governors, including Maryland\u2019s Larry Hogan and Virginia\u2019s Ralph Northam. Both of these executives have made headlines for investing in capital improvements, resource officers, counselors, and technology to make schools safer.\n\nPerched on either side of the capital, the two have also exhibited a remarkable ability to remain above D.C.\u2019s fray. A non-combative style was part of what catapulted Democratic Governor Northam to his 2017 victory in one of the most competitive battleground states in America, and a similar low-key approach helped Republican Governor Hogan hold traditionally left-leaning Maryland on Tuesday.\n\nReal progress is bigger than red and blue\n\nThese are just the most recent examples, but it\u2019s time we start listening to what voters keep telling us \u2014 that they don\u2019t believe real progress can be coded in red or blue. This week\u2019s polls show that Americans want the best of both parties\u2019 ideas.\n\nThis is something Arizona\u2019s Doug Ducey has reflected in his work on prison reform. A conservative supporter of law enforcement, Governor Ducey nonetheless launched the Second Chance program to help released inmates reintegrate into society. Evidence of his ability to cross the aisle \u2014 despite clashes between football players and Republicans on the national level, Ducey and several Arizona Cardinals have collaborated on this sensitive issue.\n\nGovernors are proving that Americans are not as politically intransigent as sensationalist media or self-interested politicos might suggest. By identifying the issues on which their constituents\u2019 needs converge, governors are securing public-private partnerships, marshalling creative ideas from all corners of their states, and building the broad support required to enact good policy. A prime example of this is Governor Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, who as a Republican in the bluest of blue states, won reelection by a whopping 33 points. A testament to his commitment to working across the aisle to ensure his constituents received tangible solutions, not empty rhetoric.\n\nThis should come as no surprise, as the U.S. originated as disparate states that came together 231 years ago to create Congress and our Constitution. The states and their respective leaders have been cooperating with each other and their federal counterparts ever since. Now these laboratories of democracy are showing just how resilient our nation is and leading the way to a more united future. From the opioid crisis to displaced workers, governors are solving America\u2019s problems.\n\nScott Pattison is executive director and CEO of the National Governors Association.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

At least 11 victims were killed at the scene; a deputy later died from his injuries, Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said. The gunman, later identified by police as Ian David Long, was found dead inside.\n\nThe bar was hosting an event for college students at the time.\n\n\"There is blood everywhere,\" Dean said Thursday morning.\n\nThis is the deadliest mass shooting in the United States since 17 students and teachers were killed at a Parkland, Florida, school in February.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nWhat happened?\n\nA gunman dressed in black, later identified by police as Long, 28, began firing at Borderline Bar and Grill around 11:20 p.m. Wednesday, authorities said.\n\nSheriff Sgt. Ron Helus was among the first to arrive on the scene, entering the bar with a California Highway Patrol officer. Helus exchanged gunfire with the suspect before being shot multiple times. He later died at a hospital.\n\nAfter spraying bullets for almost three minutes and killing 11 other victims, the gunman then went into an office near the front of the bar where he was found dead, apparently killing himself, police said.\n\nMore: Police officer, 11 other victims dead in Thousand Oaks, Calif., bar shooting\n\nMore: People threw barstools through window to escape Thousand Oaks, California bar during shooting\n\nWho was the shooter?\n\nAuthorities identified the shooter as Ian David Long, a 28-year-old Marine veteran.

USA TODAY\n\nSports agent Bret Just is often in the middle of the action these days, including at a recent Warriors-Bulls games in Chicago. (Photo: Mike Dinovo, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nMILWAUKEE \u2013 For the first time in a couple hours, one of the most powerful people in basketball can lay down his phone and lock in on the court at Fiserv Forum. Bret Just, the agent whose fingerprints are all over coaching moves at every level of the sport, has spent much of the night alternating his attention between what's happening in front of him, refreshing his scoreboard app and texting with a small college coach who is probably a few years away from the big time. .\n\nFor Just, virtually every game from October to April is an emotional grind. Someone he represents somewhere in the basketball universe is winning or losing, and even though it's less than three weeks into the NBA season, he can barely go more than a minute without trying to figure out whether it's going to be a sleepless night.\n\nBut now, with a game between the Milwaukee Bucks and New York Knicks getting close in the final minutes, it is time to focus on the client he is here to see.\n\n\u201cFiz has very positive energy right now,\u201d Just says, referring to Knicks coach David Fizdale. \u201cThe whole game he never looks rattled. I do, but I don\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nJust had worked for months to get Fizdale into another NBA head coaching job after the Memphis Grizzlies fired him 19 games into last season. The two would talk daily, going over what went wrong, what he could fix and how to win every interview that was coming in the offseason.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hit-or-miss business, and if you miss you reboot,\" Fizdale said at the team's hotel. \"He wouldn\u2019t let me waste one second being down. He sees things two steps ahead. Our conversations helped me see things I wouldn\u2019t have looked for.\"\n\nFizdale's deal with the Knicks was one of three for NBA head coaches that Just engineered in the offseason, along with J.B. Bickerstaff in Memphis and James Borrego in Charlotte, part of a profile that includes two general managers in Atlanta's Travis Schlenk and Cleveland's Koby Altman, various front office executives and some assistant coaches.\n\nJust's growing NBA network is unique given he is arguably the most influential behind-the-scenes figure in college basketball. His client list includes a dozen head coaches in the high-major leagues, several more in the mid-majors and UConn women\u2019s coach Geno Auriemma.\n\nOne of the biggest testaments to Just's reach will occur in a couple weeks at the Hall of Fame Classic in Kansas City, where all four coaches involved \u2013 Nebraska\u2019s Tim Miles, Southern Cal\u2019s Andy Enfield, Texas Tech\u2019s Chris Beard and Missouri State\u2019s Dana Ford \u2013 are his clients.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s like, you win,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in an agent\u2019s mind, I lose. ... By the same token, to be honest, it\u2019s pretty damn cool.\u201d\n\nThough Just is the first to acknowledge that the foundation of his business rests on his clients winning \u2013 \u201cWithout their success, who am I?\u201d he said \u2013 it was notable when CBS Sports polled more than 100 coaches last summer, asking them to identify the most powerful person in the sport. Just came in fourth, behind Mike Krzyzewski, John Calipari and Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany.\n\nNot long ago, however, those same coaches probably wouldn\u2019t have known the name Bret Just unless they had recruited a player out of Deerfield High in suburban Chicago, where he was the varsity basketball coach with a 58-26 career record. A mere eight years later, it would be surprising if a coaching change anywhere didn't involve him.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only four or five agents in the college space that have the majority of the coaches,\u201d said Daniel Parker, the vice president for the sports division of the powerful Parker Executive Search. \u201cIf I have a search, he\u2019s one you call. He\u2019s got a diverse group of coaches and he\u2019s done a good job of building relationships with search firms and athletics directors, but also general managers in the (NBA). That takes of a lot of relationship skills to navigate both the college and professional ranks.\u201d\n\nBut for all the influence and connections Just has amassed in a short period of time, he must descend every night into that place where he has no control over the outcome, where every time he hits refresh comes with a surge of optimism and dread.\n\nFor much of this night, it is a morose task. Borrego's team is getting blown out by the Raptors and Bickerstaff's team is a big underdog in the late game at Utah, but the rebuilding Knicks suddenly have some hope after trailing by double-digits..\n\n\"No matter what happens, they're playing their ass off,\" Just says as the Knicks tie it up at 110-110. But the optimism doesn't last long. The Bucks pull away with three 3-pointers in quick succession, leaving Just to sit silently.\n\n\u201cNow I have to worry about the Grizzlies\u2019 score,\u201d he says.\n\n'Would not allow myself to fail'\n\nWhether it was Frank Martin's longshot run to the Final Four with South Carolina in 2016 or Chris Beard going from Arkansas-Little Rock to UNLV to Texas Tech in the span of 2\u00bd weeks, Just has been at the center of some college basketball's most memorable recent moments.\n\nAnd when you ask people who have dealt with Just how someone who wasn\u2019t on the radar at the beginning of this decade became one of the power players, they almost unanimously point to the authenticity of his relationships.\n\n\u201cHe can fit into any room,\u201d said Beard, who hired Just to represent him during his only year at Arkansas-Little Rock, won an NCAA tournament game and parlayed it into the Texas Tech job. \u201cHe can come into Lubbock and eat dinner with the president of the university, then swing by and have beers with the coaches and our student managers will think he\u2019s the coolest guy ever and our AD is really comfortable with him and it\u2019s all genuine. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anyone in my life I trust more.\u201d\n\nJust's mantra is \"relationships lead to transactions,\" and there was perhaps no better example than when Washington hired former Syracuse assistant Mike Hopkins in March 2017.\n\nFew people, including Washington athletics director Jen Cohen, expected Hopkins to leave Syracuse because he had a contract that made him the coach-in-waiting after Jim Boeheim's scheduled (and subsequently rescinded) retirement in 2018.\n\nBut over the course of the prior year, Cohen, whose background was largely in football, bonded with Just as she sought his knowledge of the basketball world. Largely due to his conviction that the easy-going, empathetic Hopkins would appeal to her \u2013 \"I thought the personality fit was a 10,\" Just said \u2013 he was able to convince Cohen that she should put Hopkins on her list.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that makes Bret really good at his job is it doesn\u2019t feel transactional when you\u2019re working with him in a very transactional industry,\u201d Cohen said. \"I think he understands success isn\u2019t just how much money people are making and how many resources the schools have. Those are all important parts of the formula, but the value alignment is really important too.\u201d\n\nThe other tentpole of Just's rise is what makes his story all the more unlikely.\n\nAt age 40 and with four kids, Just decided to leave a stable life as a high school coach to pursue a far riskier career.\n\nIt wasn't Just's first foray into the agent business. After his graduation from Tulane, where he was a walk-on from 1991 to 1993 under Perry Clark, Just moved back to Chicago and joined his father Mark, a longtime baseball scout who had started a small sports agency.\n\nThat didn\u2019t turn into a long-term career, however, leaving Just trying to piece together a living through odd jobs, coaching basketball part time and running a pair of drug treatment clinics he and his father had invested in.\n\n\u201cI was watching guys give urine samples,\u201d he said.\n\nThough he eventually established himself as a full-time high school coach in 2008, Just maintained a few contacts in the agent world, which helped him land a meeting at the massive Creative Artists Agency firm in the fall of 2010.\n\nWith little to back him up other than a vision and the strength of his personality, Just sold CAA on the potential of a business focused on basketball coaches, particularly as salaries were beginning to explode with all the new television money colleges were about to receive. He also thought his coaching background would give him a head start on a few connections and be attractive to up-and-coming coaches, many of whom didn't even have agents.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day it was just whether I could build the relationships quickly enough,\u201d Just said. \u201cI\u2019m 40 years old, four kids, basically starting from scratch. But I just felt like I would not allow myself to fail.\u201d\n\nHe showed up at the Final Four in 2011 with no clients, no meetings, no connections with search firms and no real plan. Mostly, he stalked hotel lobbies looking to spark conversations with people he knew.\n\nOne of them was Brian Wardle, then the Wisconsin-Green Bay coach. They were familiar with each other because Wardle tried to recruit Duje Dukan, one of Just\u2019s Deerfield High players, who ended up signing with Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t know what I was doing, and I told him, and he was like, \u2018We should talk,\u2019\u201d Just said.\n\nEarly on, he relied on those types of chance encounters to recruit clients, one of which the following summer would change the trajectory of his career.\n\nSweet 16 payday\n\nA week before \u201cDunk City\u201d became the biggest story in college basketball in March 2013, Just left the arena in Macon, Ga., convinced that the conference championship game he had just watched could get Andy Enfield in the door of the Old Dominion coaching search.\n\nJust, who was still an unknown, had only signed Andy Enfield as a client the previous summer, the result of a random conversation in a Las Vegas restaurant late one night after all the AAU games had been played.\n\nEnfield had never hired an agent but felt like he might need one after his first year at Florida Gulf Coast because he suspected the team he had coming back might be talented enough to put him on the radar of some bigger schools.\n\n\u201cI thought (Just's) enthusiasm for what I was trying to do at FGCU and his vision for what he wanted to do was very similar,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cHe had a couple clients, but not a lot, and he was looking to the future.\u201d\n\nAfter two NCAA tournament upsets as a No. 15 seed, the future was now. Though it was almost unheard of for a coach to go from a program as small as Florida Gulf Coast to a Power Five conference, Enfield was the hottest name in the industry \u2013 and Just was in position to capitalize.\n\n\u201cOne of my frustrations when I got into the business is there was such a premium on the NCAA tournament and it felt like ADs and search firms didn\u2019t look at the whole body of work,\u201d Just said. \u201cThen I started experiencing it through my guys, and it\u2019s hard to describe the feeling when your life changes that fast.\"\n\nA couple days before the Sweet 16, Just's phone rang while he was sitting down for dinner at a fancy steakhouse in Dallas. It was the kind of call you don't miss: Southern Cal athletics director Pat Haden, and for the next hour and a half, they talked through everything as he paced outside the restaurant, from how Enfield would recruit Los Angeles to Enfield's personal story going from Wall Street to coaching.\n\nBut the conversation came with a caveat: Just, feeling confident Haden wouldn\u2019t give the job to someone else, wasn\u2019t going to distract his client with any hint of USC\u2019s interest until after Florida Gulf Coast was out of the tournament.\n\nA couple months earlier, Just had been in Enfield\u2019s office in Fort Myers, putting a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on paper. Now, as long as Enfield wanted the job, he was on the verge of negotiating a contract worth $1.5 million per year \u2013 10 times what he was making at FGCU.\n\n\u201cI wanted to try to do it by the book,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThat was a very stressful time for me because we were in the midst of a tournament run, but it was a tough situation for Bret because he had to really try to satisfy a lot of people and get information and take a lot of calls and he really had to do it on his own. There had to be a lot of trust involved.\u201d\n\nEnfield going from Florida Gulf Coast to USC became the first in a series of what Just calls \u201cmeteoric moves\u201d for his clients, based largely on NCAA tournament success.\n\nWhile there\u2019s certainly some luck involved when coaches pop onto the national scene with tournament wins, it's happened enough for Just's clients \u2013 from Beard to Brad Underwood with Stephen F. Austin to Ryan Odom with Maryland-Baltimore County \u2013 that it doesn\u2019t seem like an accident but rather an ability to evaluate coaching talent.\n\n\u201cHe knows coaching,\" said Nebraska\u2019s Tim Miles, who became one of Just\u2019s earliest clients when he was at Colorado State. \"And I think he knows what to look for and he understands what\u2019s transferable.\"\n\nSports agent Bret Just has many coaches and many games to keep track of during the college and NBA seasons. (Photo: Mike Dinovo, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nToo many clients?\n\nBefore going to the Knicks-Bucks game, Just had spent the afternoon at Marquette\u2019s practice watching another client, assistant Dwayne Killings, and meeting with Steve Wojciechowski, who is represented by a different agent at CAA.\n\nJust loves watching Wojciehowski run a practice \u2013 there\u2019s never a moment where the energy dips \u2013 but he got antsy at this one because his phone wasn\u2019t picking up service in the basement of the Al McGuire Center.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have like 70 texts when I get out of here,\" he joked.\n\nIf this were March, Just would be in real trouble. And it\u2019s not easy work, though his business has now grown to the point where he\u2019ll often replace one client with another.\n\nThe exact size of Just\u2019s client list, however, is something he doesn\u2019t discuss. Even though his reputation has now put him in a position to be selective about clients \u2013 \u201cIf I can\u2019t be fully invested, I won\u2019t take them on at this point,\u201d he said \u2013 agents often have to fight against the perception of becoming spread too thin or having too many coaches competing for the same jobs.\n\n\u201cWhen people say you have too many clients, one of the things I tell them is, \u2018You want me to have 30 coaches and act like I have three,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s why Just spends his hours sending texts of support and pores over schedules to create road trips where he can see as many people as possible.\n\nWhether it\u2019s going to Los Angeles so he can hit the Lakers and Clippers as well as USC, UC-Santa Barbara and UC-Riverside, or driving trips across the Missouri Valley and Mid-American Conference, practically every day of his schedule from now until mid-February is planned out to make sure he sees his coaches in person.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important they know I\u2019m in the trenches with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a face-time business. I want to make sure I touch everybody. You\u2019ve got to feel it. You\u2019ve got to get the pulse of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nThat constant connection he works to maintain, combined with his coaching background, makes him a de facto part of these programs. He's not just there to negotiate contracts but rather to counsel his clients on everything from sideline demeanor to how to deal with specific situations with players.\n\n\u201cI can have a basketball conversation with him, and I can get something out of it versus someone just saying, \u2018Hey you guys look good on TV,\u2019\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThis is a very lonely business at times, and the nice thing about Bret is he can be honest with me through the good and the bad. It\u2019s not always good. You\u2019re going to lose games, but he gives you a sense of reality.\"\n\nSubhead\n\nOutside the visitors\u2019 locker room in Fiserv Forum, Just mingles with Knicks executives and assistants as Fizdale gives his post-game comments following Milwaukee\u2019s 124-113 win. Even though he already had lunch with Fizdale after shootaround earlier that day, he can\u2019t make the 80-minute drive back to the Chicago suburbs without one more conversation.\n\n\u201cHopefully he\u2019ll see me standing over here and I\u2019ll tell him I love him and it\u2019s all good,\u201d he says.\n\nThe night hasn\u2019t given him much good news to this point. In addition to the Knicks, the Borrego's Hornets lost to the Raptors by 21.\n\nAs Just makes the drive home, he resists the urge to fiddle with his phone to see how his final shot at a win that night is working out.\n\nThis time, Just is with a passenger, who informs him that the Grizzlies pulled an upset in Utah, winning 92-84 and lifting his mood in a way that didn\u2019t seem possible earlier.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he says. \u201cNo they didn\u2019t. Is that final? Oh my God. Do you understand how big that is?\u201d\n\nFor the first time all night, Just can untie the knots in his stomach and perhaps even look forward to some sleep. As a long basketball season begins, with plenty of transactions ahead, he is probably going to need it.", "Barcelona defender Jordi Alba controls the ball during the Champions League group B soccer match between Inter Milan and Barcelona at the San Siro stadium in Milan, Italy, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

(Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY Network)\n\nMarijuana proponents shed no tears over the ouster of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nThey absolutely danced with glee over the departure of Pete Sessions.\n\nOne of the GOP\u2019s major casualties in the Democrats\u2019 takeover of the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday was Pete Sessions, a longtime congressman from Texas and a fervent anti-pot crusader who was shockingly knocked off by former NFL player Colin Allred in the state's 32nd district.\n\nAs chairman of the House Rules Committee, Sessions had blocked dozens of amendments to protect legal marijuana in the states where its use was permitted in some form.\n\nHis loss, combined with the approval of pro-marijuana measures in three states and the arrival of several progressive Democrats in the House, has lifted the spirits of those in the cannabis movement even more than Wednesday\u2019s dismissal of Jeff Sessions, another opponent.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think (Jeff) Sessions\u2019 actions had any negative effects, but his mindset cast a cloud of doubt and uncertainty over the space, which caused volatility and higher costs,\u2019\u2019 said Hadley Ford, CEO of iAnthus Capital Holdings, a cannabis operator.\n\nRelated: Marijuana attractions could bring tourism to Michigan\n\nMore: 3 states pass marijuana legislation in midterm elections\n\n\u201cWith Pete Sessions also voted out of his seat, we hope to see more cannabis legislation solutions come to the floor of the House for vote, helping to solve the dysfunction on a state and federal level. Today was a bad day to be a Sessions, but a good day for cannabis.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt the pro-marijuana movement has been gaining momentum, but it\u2019s not clear whether that will be enough to pave the way for its legalization at the federal level, where it remains classified as a Schedule 1 drug, just like heroin.\n\nA Gallup poll conducted in October revealed 66 percent of Americans, the highest figure on record, support legalized marijuana.\n\nOn Tuesday, Michigan became the first Midwestern state to allow recreational use of cannabis for adults 21 and older, and the ninth in the country to establish a system for regulating its commercial production and sale.\n\nThe same day, Missouri and Utah legalized the medicinal use of marijuana, increasing to 32 the number of states that permit use of the substance in some form.\n\n\u201c\"Today was a bad day to be a Sessions, but a good day for cannabis.\u201d\u201d Hadley Ford, CEO of a cannabis operator\n\nMason Tvert, spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, said the Democrats\u2019 newly gained control of the House could lead to more open discussions about changing the federal policy.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect to see an immediate rush to enact comprehensive marijuana-policy reform legislation, but we certainly will see significant gains and possibly some very important policy changes,\" he said.\n\nOne of the principal aims of the cannabis industry is to be granted full access to banking services, which remain partly out of reach because many banks are wary of running afoul of money-laundering laws or dealing with the increased red tape required for documenting transactions with marijuana-related businesses.\n\nAs a result, cannabis sales remain mostly cash deals, raising safety and logistical concerns. Tvert said he can envision Congress taking up the banking issue as soon as its next session.\n\nThat\u2019s a line in the sand Kevin Sabet does not want to see crossed. The president of the nonprofit Smart Approaches to Marijuana sees parallels between the burgeoning cannabis industry and Big Tobacco, and he insists legalization at the national level is far from inevitable while acknowledging its growing popularity.\n\nSabet considered the election results a mixed bag, highlighting positive developments for his cause that included the likely upset loss of California GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, an advocate of overhauling marijuana laws.\n\nSabet believes such defeats may help slow the push for legalization.\n\n\u201cWe want to see marijuana remain illegal at the federal level,\u2019\u2019 Sabet said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the U.S. banking system to open up to the pot industry that will try to commercialize and market marijuana any way they can. We think that\u2019s a really bad idea. We think opening up marijuana to become an industry, like alcohol or tobacco, would be disastrous for public health.\u2019\u2019\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/08/marijuana-boosters-hope-election-momentum-leads-legalization/1927459002/", "Many well-meaning people offered bland pronouncements against all violence. But Anti-Semitism is a unique kind of hate, it needs a unique response.\n\nPeople gather for a interfaith candlelight vigil a few blocks away from the site of a mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue on October 27, 2018 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. (Photo: Jeff Swensen, Getty Images)\n\nOn Saturday, October 27, there was a pogrom in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In the deadliest attack on Jews in American history, 11 Jewish men and women were shot to death in the Tree of Life Synagogue by a violent anti-Semite who shouted \u201call Jews must die\u201d before opening fire in the sanctuary.\n\nMore than 100 years ago, my family was driven from Tsarist Russia by pogroms, and came to the \u201cgoldene medina,\u201d the golden country, which offered the luminous promise of safety and prosperity. What happened late last month was not supposed to happen here. Over there yes, but never here.\n\nAlmost four years ago, I was traveling in Europe, and I attended Shabbat services one morning at a synagogue in London. As is standard protocol in European synagogues, I was questioned before I reached the door. Where are you from? What are you here for? Say \u201cshibboleth\u201d so I know how Jewish you are. I wrote about that experience and about the sorrow I felt at having to prove my Judaism to enter my sacred spaces and about the sorrow I felt for European Jews who did not know the safety and ease I felt as an American Jew. How young I must have seemed, how American, to be so sure of my place in the world.\n\nA few weeks later, I would be sitting in a pew of a Copenhagen synagogue, at a memorial service for Dan Uzan, a community member who was serving as a security guard for a bat mitzvah celebration when he was shot and killed. I heard the prime minister, with her blonde hair pulled back, speak from the bimah. \u201cYou are Danes,\u201d she assured the room. \u201cYesterday, today, and tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, earlier that same day a community leader had told me, \u201cit was always a question of when, not if.\u201d\n\nIt isn't enough to condemn 'hate' generally\n\nIn some ways, my reaction to this shooting was a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. It\u2019s another day in America and conversations abound about security at houses of worship, improved gun control laws, and divisive rhetoric coming from the administration. And yet, this kind of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu feels different to me. It runs deeper.\n\nAcross the country, memorials and vigils for the 11 slain in Pittsburgh have drawn hundreds and thousands, Jews and non-Jews alike. There are so many people who have offered the most powerful thing they have \u2014 their political and emotional solidarity.\n\nMore: How to overcome anti-Semitism and hate? Pittsburgh's community shows the way forward.\n\nTree of Life synagogue shooting: 'A difficult and dark week' for Jews, but we are not alone\n\nHolocaust survivor shares her story of escaping death after Pittsburgh shooting\n\nAnd yet, many have offered only bland pronouncements against violence, against hate. Many have lumped the other horrific events of the week into one deplorable basket: bombs sent to Democratic leaders; the shooting of two black people in a grocery store in Kentucky (after the shooter was unable to enter a nearby predominantly black church); and the Tree of Life massacre. Drawing connections among these acts is vital to understanding the ways in which systems of oppression reinforce one other and is key to their undoing.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nNot all violence, not all acts of hatred, are the same. Each of these crimes deserves to be examined in their own contexts. To put them all under one heading, to speak of all \"oppressions\" when faced with one particular kind, is an erasure, \u201can adoption of a spurious universalism that is designed to shut down particular voices speaking of particular problems,\" as The New Republic's Jeet Heer explained.\n\nThe synagogue shooting, following the 60 percent surge in anti-Semitic incidents across the country from 2016 to 2017, was an act of violence against Jews for their Judaism. The deadliest attack yet on American Jews, in a synagogue, on Shabbat morning, at a ceremony welcoming a new baby into the Jewish people.\n\nHashtag advocacy won't stop attacks\n\nLast Shabbat, Jews across the country took part in a campaign led by the American Jewish Committee called #ShowUpForShabbat. I cannot help but remember the campaign started by the European Union of Jewish Students after the shooting of Dan Uzan called #IGoToSynagogue. How many hashtags will it take before things don\u2019t return to status quo, before something changes?\n\nRabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, in his famous work \u201cThe Sabbath\u201d speaks of Shabbat as a \"cathedral\" in time. It is a holy one, and I think the time may also have come for another, more mundane, but equally important cathedral in American public discourse: one that is just for anti-Semitism. Not to the exclusion or marginalization of other conversations; instead to create a space built for this one in particular.\n\nThose shots fired in a shul resound like a canary in coal mine, like a shofar on Rosh Hashanah, a call meant to wake up the soul to make changes in the coming year. But this one isn\u2019t a wake-up call, it\u2019s a warning bell, its peal reverberating in my heart and in my head and for my fellows across the country, Jewish and non-Jewish alike.\n\nWill we heed it in time?\n\nChelsea Garbell is a graduate student in international policy and management at New York University\u2019s Wagner School of Public Service.

Here\u2019s how to make installation a breeze. (Photo: Photo courtesy of ARS/Rescue Rooter)\n\nWhat could you do with an extra 30 minutes every day? Spend time with loved ones, pursue a new hobby, or even fit in more exercise?\n\nAccording to a survey by CNET and Coldwell Banker, 57% of Americans save an average of a half hour each day \u2014 adding up to 182.5 hours a year \u2014 simply by using smart home products. While you may benefit from a single product or two, you get the most time back in your day with an ecosystem of smart home products that seamlessly work together.\n\n\u201cWith connected products, you can bring your home to a new level of interactivity with your family. A smart home can make your life more convenient, as well as your home more energy efficient,\u201d says Tyler Beesley, Director of Smart Home & Strategic Alliances at American Residential Services (ARS). \u201cAs time goes on, your smart home learns from your lifestyle and then becomes even more cost-effective and convenient throughout your day-to-day life.\u201d\n\nHowever, you only save time and money if the products are properly installed and integrated together. Otherwise, you end up wasting weekends adjusting wiring and spending hours on the phone with support to get the results you expected. If you are putting off purchasing additional smart-home products, or even your first one, because you dread a complicated installation process, consider hiring a smart home expert to help you design your ideal smart home and install the devices to get you started.\n\nA smart thermostat, like the Nest Learning Thermostat pictured here, learns what temperature you like and automatically programs itself. (Photo: Photo courtesy of ARS/Rescue Rooter)\n\nHere are four tips to designing and installing a smart home ecosystem:\n\n1. Think about your goal for adding smart-home products.\n\nMany people purchase a single smart home product that catches their attention and then haphazardly adds additional devices. While homeowners who use this approach do see benefits from their smart products, you can see a much greater return by thoughtfully designing an ecosystem of integrated products based on your concerns, goals and lifestyle. GfK research found that more than half of U.S. consumers feel that a smart home of interconnected devices will change their lives in the next few years.\n\n2. Evaluate your wireless coverage and bandwidth.\n\nAll the smart home devices in your home, including lights, locks, sprinkler systems, cameras and even smart washing machines, use your wireless internet connection and consume Wi-Fi bandwidth.\n\n\u201cBandwidth is becoming more and more indispensable. The average home has 10 connected devices today. By 2020, the number will grow to 50 devices. Everything in your home is likely to connect to your wireless network,\u201d Beesley explains. \u201cHomes not having adequate bandwidth is one of the most common problems we see when helping homeowners design and install a smart home ecosystem. This need for bandwidth will continue to grow.\u201d\n\nBecause of this dramatic increase in a short period of time, you must ensure that your home has adequate bandwidth to meet your needs both today and in the near future. Otherwise, the new smart home devices you add will not work correctly, and you will need to spend additional time and money to upgrade your internet service.\n\nIn addition to lacking bandwidth, Beesley says that many homes have areas that do not receive wireless signals \u2014 such as a basement great room, or a shed at the rear of your property that you want to monitor with a security camera. He recommends using a product such as a mesh wireless system to maximize your wireless speed and coverage to ensure your connected devices stay online and work together properly.\n\nNest Cam security cameras and the Nest Hello video doorbell can increase home security, but it\u2019s important to know if your house has enough Wi-Fi bandwidth to support them. (Photo: Photo courtesy of ARS/Rescue Rooter)\n\n3. Investigate your infrastructure and wiring before purchasing devices.\n\nMany homeowners install smart doorbells to make their home more secure. The Los Angeles Police Department found that smart doorbells increase security and cut burglaries by half.\n\n\u201cOne of the hottest products we are seeing in the smart home market today is video-enabled doorbells,\u201d says Beesley. \u201cHowever, many homeowners purchase these products and then discover that they do not have the right doorbell infrastructure to install the device.\u201d\n\nHe says the most common issues are not having the correct doorbell transformer, and the home having wiring in a gauge that is too small. By addressing these issues before installation, you can save time, as well as the frustration of having a half-finished project for days, or even weeks, while you update your infrastructure.\n\nAnother common area for installation issues is the compatibility of HVAC units with smart thermostats, such as the Nest thermostats. Because air conditioning units can account for around 50% of a home\u2019s electrical costs, smart thermostats can save significant energy and money.\n\nWhile Grand View Research found that smart thermostats can reduce power use up to 30%, the HVAC unit must have compatible wiring and you must properly program the thermostat to see this cost saving. Beesley says that ARS technicians use their extensive HVAC system experience to properly set up the integration between the unit and the smart thermostat, and maximize the available features on the device.\n\n4. Determine the most effective locations for devices and sensors.\n\nSmart home devices such as smoke detectors, carbon monoxide alarms and leak detection devices can help keep your family out of harm\u2019s way and significantly reduce property damage.\n\n\u201cHowever, it\u2019s important to know where to place devices, such as the Nest Protect smoke and CO alarm to best detect issues when they arise in your home. By integrating these devices with products that can automatically shut down your gas appliances, you can create an even safer environment,\u201d says Beesley. He says that it\u2019s also essential for homeowners to know their local municipal codes for smoke and carbon monoxide detection before installing smart devices.\n\nSmart products can help you focus on what matters. (Photo: Photo courtesy of ARS/Rescue Rooter)\n\nBecause water damage can cost thousands of dollars to repair, Beesley recommends homeowners also install a leak detection system, such as leakSMART Leak Detection System, which uses both sensors and algorithms to detect water leaks in the home.\n\n\u201cIf you are on vacation and your hot water heater leaks, you won\u2019t know about it until you come home from vacation days later to a flooded basement,\u201d Beesley says. \u201cHowever, when you work with ARS to install a leak detection system, we can help you put the sensors in the locations in your home that will have the highest probability of detecting most water-related issues. The leak detection system will then send a notification to your mobile device and actually shut off your water supply till the source of the leak is identified and fixed.\u201d\n\nInstalling smart home products yourself can be time-consuming and frustrating. But even more importantly, you can cost yourself money and time by not having properly-installed devices. In addition to spending more money on electricity, improperly-installed technology may not protect you from hazards around the home as designed. Google partners like ARS Smart Home have the expertise and experience to help you design a smart home ecosystem based on your lifestyle, goals and budget. By working with an expert, your devices are installed correctly, and your ecosystem is just right for your home.\n\nMembers of the editorial and news staff of the USA Today Network were not involved in the creation of this content.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/sponsor-story/ars-smart-home/2018/11/08/how-make-smart-home-installation-easier/1919185002/", "ManU forward Anthony Martial, center, runs with the ball in between Juventus midfielder Miralem Pjanic, left, and Mattia De Sciglio, during the Champions League group H soccer match between Juventus and Manchester United at the Allianz stadium in Turin, Italy, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018. (AP Photo/Antonio Calanni) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nForget about Raheem Sterling tripping himself up and still winning a penalty. He's no longer the fall-guy at Manchester City.\n\nIn fact, the oft-criticized winger has become one of the most appreciated and important members of Pep Guardiola's record-breaking side and might be in the form of his career heading into the Manchester derby on Sunday.\n\nTake, for example, Sterling's contributions for City over the past week: He set up Riyad Mahrez's winning goal at Tottenham 10 days ago, he scored two goals and set up three more in a 6-1 victory over Southampton on Sunday, then curled in the goal of the night in City's 6-0 thrashing of Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League on Wednesday.\n\nOf course, Sterling was in the spotlight for other reasons against Shakhtar. In one of the most farcical of refereeing decisions, Sterling was awarded a penalty despite kicking the turf and tumbling over under no pressure from a defender.\n\nOtherwise, he barely put a foot wrong in the match, constantly tormenting Shakhtar's defense with his movement and pace. His finish for the goal \u2014 a curling 20-meter shot into the top corner after bursting through two defenders \u2014 spoke volumes for his confidence and frame of mind, even after the embarrassment of the earlier penalty decision.\n\n\"The first season,\" Guardiola said, \"he was scared. He was looking and thinking, 'Who is the guy I am going to pass the ball to?'\"\n\nNow, his decision-making and poise in the opposition's penalty box is much improved. It has a lot to do with the faith put in him by Guardiola and the work City's assistant coach, Mikel Arteta, has done with Sterling on the practice field. Specifically, according to Guardiola, \"the last action on the pitch, that control in the last moment.\"\n\nThat was something for which Sterling was heavily criticized during the World Cup, when he squandered a slew of one-on-one chances while virtually playing as a striker in a 5-3-2 formation. His well-taken goals for England in a 3-2 win against Spain in the UEFA Nations League last month were his first for his country in three years \u2014 making for a goal drought of 27 games.\n\nHe has been a frequent scorer for City under Guardiola, though. He is already up to seven this season, backing up his career-best haul of 23 from last season.\n\nPlaying mostly as a right winger, Sterling has scored many goals from far-post tap-ins following crosses from the left, mostly from Leroy Sane \u2014 a pre-planned move that City works hard on in training.\n\nThis season, Guardiola has often chosen to deploy Sterling as an inside forward on the left, mainly to accommodate the forward runs of fit-again left back Benjamin Mendy, and it has led to the forward scoring other types of goals where he cuts in from the left with the ball at his feet and finds the far corner. He has done just that against Arsenal, Newcastle and now Shakhtar.\n\nIn Anthony Martial, United also has a flourishing winger with a new lease on life now that he appears to be more appreciated by his manager. The 22-year-old Frenchman has scored in each of his last four Premier League games and is now someone Jose Mourinho feels he can finally rely on.\n\nWith City always looking to play offensively under Guardiola and Mourinho now realizing attack might be United's best form of defense in light of his error-strewn backline, there is a decent chance this latest derby could be a thrilling watch.\n\nCity hasn't lost all season and is at the top of the Premier League. United has returned to form and will arrive at Etihad Stadium off a 2-1 win at Juventus in the Champions League.\n\nIf there are goals, expect Sterling and Martial to be among them.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Few believed then, however, that Bayern would be four points behind and struggling after 10 matches.\n\n\"We're not going as favorites to Dortmund, but as outsiders - for the first time in a long time,\" Hoeness said after Bayern's 2-0 win over AEK Athens in the Champions League on Wednesday. \"You can't just go to Dortmund and say, I want three points. Dortmund has played a very good season up to now, no question.\"\n\nDespite losing at Atletico Madrid 2-0 on Tuesday, Dortmund remains the only unbeaten team in the Bundesliga after racking up 30 goals in 10 games. The team managed 15 competitive games without defeat under Lucien Favre, ensuring he made the best start any Dortmund coach.\n\nEven the loss to Atletico, which it beat 4-0 in their previous game, is being viewed positively by the club.\n\n\"Perhaps it's not so bad after the last few weeks in which everything was top, to be brought back down to earth a little bit,\" Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki said.\n\nDortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke went even further.\n\n\"I'm a bit happy that this long series (unbeaten) is over. It focuses minds for Saturday,\" Watzke said.\n\nDortmund lost in Munich 6-0 in the previous meeting in March, with Robert Lewandowski scoring a hat trick against his former club. However, Dortmund is a new team under Favre and its new consultants of former captain Sebastian Kehl and Matthias Sammer.\n\nNew players like Belgium midfielder Axel Witsel and Denmark midfielder Thomas Delaney have helped stabilize the team, while Spanish striker Paco Alcacer has been a revelation since his arrival on loan from Barcelona.\n\nFavre has got the young players firing, too. Jadon Sancho (18), Achraf Hakimi (19), Dan-Axel Zagadou (19) and Jacob Bruun Larsen (20) are all thriving this season.\n\nDortmund's resurgence has revitalized the league.

Last Saturday's 1-1 draw at home against Freiburg added to the pressure on new coach Niko Kovac.\n\nKovac was always going to face a challenge following the experienced Jupp Heynckes, who led the club to a league, cup and Champions League treble in 2013 and got it firing again when he returned last season to take over from Carlo Ancelotti.\n\n\"We're not playing with ease at the moment,\" Kovac said after the game in Athens. \"We really have to work hard.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Bundesliga coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/Bundesliga and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Trump\u2019s unique brand of racism, xenophobia, and transphobia \u2014 his fear-mongering \u2014 mobilized many of his supporters to support GOP candidates who stood close by his side. The most prominent Republicans who closely mimed the president\u2019s playbook, and won: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Iowa Rep. Steve King, who were reelected; Rep. Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor-elect; and Brian Kemp, holding on to a slim lead over Democrat Stacey Abrams in the Georgia governor's race.\n\nIt sure paid off for them to play nasty like the president.\n\nAlthough three-quarters of Americans say that the incivility in our political discourse is a crisis, according to a 2017 study, Carolyn Lukensmeyer, executive director of the National Institute on Civil Discourse, told me that \u201cvoters seemed to reward those candidates who were using language to degrade and even demonize their opponents.\u201d\n\nMake no mistake, Trump cast the election as a referendum on himself.

(Photo: Marvin O. Jimenez for the USA TODAY Network)\n\nTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif. \u2014 Authorities are trying to piece together why a Marine combat veteran opened fire during a College Night at a crowded country dance bar in Southern California, killing 12 and sending terrified patrons jumping through windows to escape.\n\nAmong the dead is a sheriff's sergeant who rushed to the scene of the late-night shooting Wednesday.\n\nThe gunman, David Long, 28, wore a hood, bandana and black clothing as he indiscriminately fired into the crowd. Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said Long, who lived in the town of Newbury Park, killed himself as police closed in.\n\nLong was a former machine gunner and Afghanistan war veteran who was interviewed by police at his home last spring after an episode of agitated behavior that authorities were told might be post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nThe violence erupted at the Borderline Bar and Grill, a country western dance bar in Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles west of Los Angeles. Hundreds of people fled in terror, including some who used bar stools to break windows and escape.\n\n\"It\u2019s a horrific scene in there,\u201d said Dean, who choked up at one point while speaking to reporters in the bar's parking lot. \u201cThere\u2019s blood everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff said police have had \"several contacts\" with Long in recent years. Most notably, police said, he was \"angry and acting a little irrationally\" when a mental health crisis team was called to his home earlier this year to investigate a disturbance. The team concluded Long did not need to be taken into custody, he said.\n\nIn addition, Long was listed as the victim in a bar skirmish three years ago, Dean said.\n\nAt a late-afternoon news conference Thursday, Paul Delacourt, assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said the crime scene, the gunman\u2019s home and car were being processed for evidence. But he said it was too early to determine a motive for the shootings.\n\n\"We're hoping to paint a picture of the state of mind of the suspect,\" Delacourt said.\n\nDemocratic Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom, in his first public appearance since winning office on Tuesday, lamented the violence that has come again to California.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gun culture,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to a bar or nightclub? You can\u2019t go to church or synagogue? It\u2019s insane is the only way to describe it. The normalization, that\u2019s the only way I can describe it. It\u2019s become normalized.\u201d\n\nA Marine corporal, Long served for five years \u2013 from 2008 to 2013 \u2013 including a seven-month tour in Afghanistan, according to Marine Corps records. Long earned several awards, including a Combat Action Ribbon and a Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal.\n\nPolice say he was armed with a legally purchased Glock 21 .45-caliber handgun designed to hold 10 rounds plus one in the chamber. But the sheriff said the gun had an extended magazine that is illegal in California.\n\nAfter spraying bullets for almost three minutes, the gunman entered an office near the front of the bar, where he was found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nCLOSE A hooded gunman dressed in black opened fire on a country dance bar popular with college students in Southern California, killing 11 people and a sheriff's sergeant. The shooter also died in the melee. USA TODAY\n\n\"It appears he walked up to the scene, shot the security guard who was standing outside, then stepped inside,\" Dean said. \"It appears that he turned to the right and shot several of the other security guards and employees and began opening fire inside the nightclub.\"\n\nPepperdine University said on Twitter that \"multiple\" students from the college were at the scene during the attack.\n\nOfficials at California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks canceled classes for the day, university spokeswoman Karin Grennan said. Officials said they didn\u2019t know whether any of the students were among the victims but nonetheless opened the campus chapel and deployed school counselors.\n\nEighteen people made their own way to local hospitals, and two were taken by ambulance, according to the Ventura County Sheriff's Office.\n\nSgt.

Ron Helus, who was shot after he entered the building, died at a hospital early Thursday.\n\nHelus and a passing highway patrolman were responding to several 911 calls when they arrived at the bar around 11:20 p.m., the sheriff said. They heard gunfire and went inside.\n\nHelus was immediately struck by multiple gunshots, Dean said. The highway patrolman cleared the perimeter and pulled Helus out and waited as a SWAT team and scores more officers arrived.\n\nThe sheriff said there were \u201cmultiple other victims\u201d with different levels of injury.\n\nThe bar, which includes a large dance hall with a stage and a pool room along with several smaller areas for eating and drinking, is a popular hangout for students from nearby California Lutheran University, particularly on College Night.\n\nMore: What we know about Thousand Oaks gunman Ian David Long, a Marine veteran\n\nMore: Some Thousand Oaks victims survived mass shooting in Las Vegas, reports say\n\nMore: 'He died a hero': Ventura County Sheriff Sgt.

It also came less than two weeks after a gunman killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.\n\nMatt Wennerstrom, 20, said the attacker first opened fire on employees working the front desk.\n\n\"I grabbed as many people as I could and pulled them down underneath the pool table we were close to until he ran out of bullets for that magazine and had to reload,\" he said.\n\nWennerstrom, a regular customer, said he and other patrons used bar stools to break open a window to help people escape. \"We were shuttling as many people out as we could,\" he said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump ordered flags to be flown at half-staff until sunset Saturday at the White House and on all public buildings, military posts, naval stations and aboard all U.S. naval vessels. He also directed the flag to be flown at half-staff at all U.S. embassies and military bases and naval stations abroad.\n\nA witness, John Hedge, said he saw the suspect tossing smoke bombs into the front of the restaurant, KABC-TV reports.\n\n\"The gunman was throwing smoke grenades all over the place.

The first battles to reclaim America's future have been lost.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nFirst, the very good news. The checks and balances of the Madisonian system have kicked in. With Democrats gaining control of the House, the legislative progress of Trump and Trumpism has been halted. Congressional oversight of the executive branch, complete with investigations of rampant malfeasance, will commence. Democratic victories and close margins in races in Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin reveal that Trump\u2019s road map to reelection in 2020 is strewn with significant barriers.\n\nNow for the seriously bad news.\n\nThe most striking feature of Tuesday\u2019s voting was the absence of a blue wave. At a moment of extraordinary menace, Democratic gains in the House were within the ordinary range for an off-year election. In the Senate, Democrats moved backwards. Pundits and politicians can spin it a million different ways, but the bottom line is that the electorate did not repudiate Trump. Instead, it chose to normalize the grossly abnormal.\n\nThe United States has seen vicious demagogues come and go before. Figures like Joe McCarthy and George Wallace left their ugly mark on American history. But they were kept within bounds and ultimately repudiated. Donald Trump, who in 2016 pulled an inside straight to make it to the White House, is the great exception.\n\nTrump has normalized immorality nationwide\n\n\u201cThose that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well,\u201d tweeted Trump in the election\u2019s aftermath. \u201cThose that did not, say goodbye!\u201d Trump is absolutely correct, for he has succeeded in remaking the Republican Party in his image. In his post-election press conference, he opted to ridicule those Republicans who declined to pay proper obeisance, to kiss his ring with sufficient ardor, and went on to lose their seats.\n\nNot long ago, conservatives were pining for the remoralization of American society, for a religious awakening that would reduce crime, divorce, abortion, welfare dependency and other social ills. Now those same conservatives, and millions of ordinary Americans along with them, have lent their support to a party led by the emptiest of celebrities, a decades-long denizen of Studio 54, a serial sexual predator, a low-life operator of beauty pageants, a bankrupter of casinos, a perpetrator of frauds like Trump University, a braggadocious ignoramus, a gutter-level pathological liar. Three years ago, Donald Trump was a triple-X freak show. Tuesday\u2019s results have validated him with something close to a family-friendly rating of G.\n\nMore: America is rejecting Trump and protecting democracy\n\nFour midterm takeaways, including how Democrats should handle Trump\n\nDonald Trump could get the last laugh in the 2020 presidential election\n\nInstead of remoralization, we have been given exactly what Trump came into office vowing to end: \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201d A slow-moving caravan of refugees fleeing violence-torn impoverished countries of Central America, still hundreds of miles from America\u2019s borders, was branded an \u201cinvasion.\u201d In meeting the imaginary threat, \u201ceverything is on the table,\u201d said Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\n\u201cEverything\u201d?\n\nEvidently, yes. Trump mobilized the American military, deployed it to the border, and declared that stones were to be met with rifle shots.\n\nLittle to celebrate in Tuesday's election results\n\nIs it an accident that the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, the murder of 11 Jews in a synagogue, occurred under a president who has been whipping up a frenzy of racism and hatred? With a shrug and a non-sequitur, Trump, in his press conference, disclaimed any and all responsibility for the swell of racial and religious conflict, pointing to his warm relations with the state of Israel.\n\nWhile there are silver linings in the election results, most of the clouds are dark. The darkest of them all is that there is no discernible way back to normalcy. As in a bloody ethnic civil war, once the rules of civility are dispensed with, they are not readily restored. Trump\u2019s fascist-style rallies are exhibit A. Thousands of our fellow Americans trek to these spectacles, waiting in line and enduring rain and cold to chant slogans antithetical to democracy, to cheer grotesque attacks on the rule of law and to commune with their adored leader.\n\nWhatever happens or does not happen in Congress, whatever transpires on the road to the 2020 elections, the fact of the matter is that in three short years the face of America has profoundly changed. A significant fraction of the society has been lured into moral degradation by the siren song of a demagogue.\n\nThere is little to celebrate in Tuesday\u2019s results. To a significant degree, and despite the limited Democratic victories, the first battles for America\u2019s future have been badly lost. If America is to become great again in a true non-Trumpian sense, a difficult and protracted war for hearts and minds lies ahead.\n\nGabriel Schoenfeld, a member of USA TODAY\u2019s Board of Contributors and the author of \"Necessary Secrets: National Security, the Media, and the Rule of Law,\" was a senior adviser to the 2012 Romney for President campaign.

Every seat is filled, and the place rocks with energy and anticipation.\n\nIndeed, it couldn't be any louder if the Giants or Jets were playing in a Super Bowl there.\n\nExcept there's no football game about to kick off. It's one of 14 NFL and 19 overall stadium stops for Kenny Chesney on his five-month, 42-show \"Trip Around The Sun\" tour earlier this year. And the musical magic about to be created rivals anything the place has ever seen.\n\nFor country music's biggest star \u2014 Chesney is the only country act in Billboard's Top 10 touring artists of the last quarter-century \u2014 and a nominee for a ninth Entertainer of the Year honor at next week's CMA awards show, the marriage of music and sports is a natural.\n\n\"When I was growing up, I had two passions: sports and music,\" Chesney says. \"They were things that made you feel even more alive, and they lifted you up. It was almost hard to separate the way playing football made you feel from how being at a great concert was. Music is such a primal force: it's inside us, without thinking.\n\n\"I think playing sports is the same way. How you feel when you're on the field, that immediate rush is the ultimate high. When I started playing for tips and burritos at Quarterback's, it was the same thing \u2014 only less intense, because there were so many variables. But as time went on, as I learned about writing songs, really dialing in on life and performing so I know I'm reaching people at the back of the room, that intensity of how it feels when it's right became the same thing. When the drum kicks, the lights start and you can hear the crowd even before the curtain falls, it's like that first play of the night. ... It's on, and there's nowhere in the world you'd rather be.\"\n\nChesney spends up to three hours on the stage performing a collection of hits pretty much unequaled among contemporaries in any music genre. It's an exhausting trip for virtually everyone: band members, stagehands, crew and, of course, the audience. And it's worth every second.\n\nNFL games generally last about that long and can create the same aura.\n\n\"If we do it right, hopefully we wring every spec of energy out of the fans,\" Chesney explains. \"Sometimes you can feel a slight ebb during the last song. But what's more likely to happen, the energy feeds itself, so by the end, they're hitting a whole other plateau. They may sleep til 2 the next day, but they're bringing it hard, and they're not quitting.\n\n\"Honestly, it's part of how the band and I can also build our energy: No Shoes Nation feeds us. We go out to give them absolutely everything, but I always say, they give us more than we give them.\"\n\nRobert Kraft would agree. The owner of the New England Patriots is a certified member of No Shoes Nation. He has had a special relationship with Chesney since 2005, when the first of 19 concerts at Gillette Stadium took place.\n\n\"Kenny's music is truly one of a kind. It has this unique and special quality to it that takes people to a place where they can forget the day-to-day worries of life and enjoy the moment, whether in the car listening to the radio or in stadium full of people singing along. When you see Kenny live in concert, his personal energy and charisma is like no one else,\" Kraft said. \"He brings you into the melody and the moment, and it takes those feelings to an entirely different level. After 14 years and 19 shows at Gillette Stadium, I continue to be blown away by the way Kenny and his music affects people. It truly is one of my favorite scenes, seeing 60,000 happy, glowing faces taking in the timeless greatness that is Kenny Chesney.\"\n\nChesney is the biggest ticket seller for any musical genre at MetLife Stadium, where Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi and Taylor Swift have been regulars. The Trip Around The Sun show at MetLife Stadium in August was delayed by a severe thunderstorm before one of the accompanying bands, Old Dominion, took the stage. That also pushed back the set by Thomas Rhett and Chesney, who played and sang beyond midnight.\n\nYet, just as they would for a big game involving the Giants or Jets, the fans remained, their enthusiasm only whetted, not wetted down.\n\n\"There are two things,\" says Chesney, whose most recent chart-topping album, \"Songs For The Saints,\" is a tribute to the Virgin Islands that were devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria last year. Chesney had a home on St. John. \"One, I think sports and music are the two things people are truly passionate about, so there's always going to be similarities in the response. I know plenty of football fans are out there; heck, there's a lot of players, the coaching staff, people affiliated with the teams at the shows.\n\n\"But just as importantly, there's that sense of pride in what No Shoes Nation stands for. For the fans who are just music people, they have the same connection to how the songs we sing hold their lives as sports fans have about their team kind of representing the best of who they are. You know, there's no thrill greater than high school football, and seeing your team rush out on the field, and I think that carries over to the NFL for adults, and just people who remember when.\"\n\nThose folks tend to remember when they witnessed a particularly memorable game. They definitely recall attending \u2014 and being such a large part of \u2014 a Chesney concert.\n\n\"I don't think anything surpasses the excitement of seeing your favorite team play,\" he says, \"but I do think people who come to these stadiums really bring their most passionate selves. When they come to these places \u2014 Levi Stadium, Arrowhead Stadium, Raymond James Stadium \u2014 they come to throw everything they have at their team.\n\n\"And I think they bring that mindset when they walk in the door for our shows, too.\"\n\nChesney has not committed to another stadium tour. In 2019, he is planning a more intimate series of concerts. But perhaps the unforgettable vibes from the previous concerts will lead to another Trip Around the Sun.\n\nRegardless, Chesney and No Shoes Nation have proven the bond between music and sports is unbreakable.\n\n\"I love football, and the discipline that goes into playing it,\" he says. \"I've been lucky to be friends with Sean Payton, the Manning family, Drew Brees, a lot of those guys, not to mention so many people a casual fan might not know. I've been to practice; I've been to games. I still get a little amazed that I know every inch of a lot of these buildings I see on TV every week, because I stopped growing in the ninth grade, and that was the end of any dream of playing sports for a living.\n\n\"When I think about that, or when I'm onstage, and looking all the way to the top, it's a pretty unbelievable feeling. All those games, all that energy, and we get to be part of these places in a way that's just as passionate and intense in a whole other way. It reminds me how powerful music can be.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The senior guards and off-campus roommates for No. 1 Notre Dame will always have Brooklyn, too.\n\nThe friendship between Ogunbowale, the Milwaukee scoring machine, and Mabrey, the street-wise Jersey shore kid, was cemented at the Barclays Center on April 17, 2015 in the Jordan Brand Classic\n\n\"We were guarding each other,\" recalled Mabrey, a prep All-American from Manasquan (N.J.) High School. \"And we actually were laughing at each other because we were playing so horribly.\"\n\nMabrey, who had averaged 22.1 points, 6.8 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 3.0 steals in high school, had drawn the defensive assignment on Ogunbowale, a prep All-American who averaged 22.2 points, 9.6 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 2.2 steals per game at Divine Savior Holy Angels.\n\nTheir stat lines were not pretty in the game won by Mabrey's East squad, 76-75. In 20 minutes, Ogunbowale scored three points, hitting just one of eight field-goal shots. Mabrey went 0 for 8 and finished with 1 point.\n\n\"We WERE bad,\" laughed Ogunbowale, who also was Mabrey's teammate 16 days earlier in the McDonald's All-American Classic in Chicago. Mabrey scored 12 points with six rebounds and five steals that day in winning co-most valuable player honors and Ogunbowale added nine points as their East team beat the West, 89-87.\n\nIt was the start of a beautiful relationship that only got stronger last April in Columbus in the championship game. Ogunbowale hit a 3-pointer with 0.1 seconds remaining to lift Notre Dame to a 61-58 comeback victory over Mississippi State. It came two days after Ogunbowale nailed a long jumper with a second left in overtime to knock off top-ranked Connecticut, 91-89.\n\n\"Ice Twice\" they call Ogunbowale, whose two buzzer-beaters earned her the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four and whose infectious smile earned her a spot on \"Dancing With The Stars\" after she concluded a remarkable junior year during which she averaged 20.8 points and earned All-America honors.\n\nMabrey earned all-Atlantic Coast Conference honors after a regular season in which she averaged 14.4 points a game after coach Muffet McGraw moved her to point guard when Mychal Johnson and Lili Thompson suffered season-ending ACL injuries. Mabrey, whose sister Michaela preceded her at Notre Dame by three seasons, was even better in the NCAA Tournament, averaging 15.8 points and 5.2 assists per game while shooting 50 percent (19 of 38) from beyond the 3-point line.\n\nThis talented backcourt is a major reason the Irish are the preseason No. 1 heading into Friday's season opener against Harvard.\n\n\"From where they started to where they are now, I've seen great progression,\" McGraw said. \"Coming off all her accomplishments last season, the biggest thing I've seen from Arike is the leadership role she has taken. She is more vocal, especially with our freshmen. She's always encouraging them, instructing them \u2014 they are eager to listen to her.\"\n\nMabrey said her roommate lets her know about those famous buzzer-beaters all the time.\n\n\"I call her Our Lady of Arike,\" Mabrey quipped.\n\nBut she is grateful for Ogunbowale and how she helped bring Notre Dame its second NCAA title in McGraw's 31-year tenure in South Bend.\n\n\"I remember all the time we spent in the gym, her working on her shot,\" Mabrey said. \"She had the opportunity to show how hard she worked, how much time she put in to live that moment. I was just so happy she got the opportunity to do that.\"\n\nOgunbowale, of course, knows there's no title if not for the sacrifice Mabrey made from moving from off guard to the point.\n\n\"It told me that Marina was a team player,\" Ogunbowale said. \"The point guard is the most important player on the floor. For Marina to give up the ball, to run plays, to learn where everyone needs to be, that was super big. She took on that role with ease.\"\n\nTheir personalities have rubbed off on each other.\n\n\"I think I've become more chilled hanging around her all the time,\" Mabrey admitted. \"Arike has become more vocal, more aggressive. She has more of a sense of urgency now \u2014 I love it.\"\n\nOgunbowale and Mabrey share the same business major at Notre Dame \u2014 management consulting \u2014 and they share the housework when they are not watching television, playing cards and just relaxing. Basketball is rarely spoken or seen, though the pair did watch the Michigan State-Kansas and Kentucky-Duke men's doubleheader earlier this week with friends.\n\n\"We made some buffalo dip,\" said Ogunbowale, who leaves the cooking to Mabrey.\n\n\"I usually do the cooking \u2014 she likes apple chicken sausage,\" Mabrey said. \"Arike does make breakfast, and she does the dishes more than I do because the dishes are disgusting to me.\"\n\nBoth, of course, don't mind doing the dirty work on the basketball floor if it leads one last time to the Final Four in Tampa next April.\n\n\"Knowing how hard we've worked these last three years, I'm looking forward to putting it out there one more time,\" Mabrey said.\n\nAt least she won't have to guard her roommate.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Nick Wagner/Austin American-Statesman via AP, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSome things to know about Week 11 in the Big 12 Conference:\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK\n\nNo. 15 Texas (6-3, 4-2, No. 19 CFP) at Texas Tech (5-4, 3-3). While both teams have lost two games in a row, the Longhorns could still make it to the Big 12 championship game. Texas Tech is trying to get bowl eligible in its final game on campus this season. Texas is coming off a 42-41 loss to No. 7 West Virginia, a week after the Longhorns lost 38-35 at Oklahoma State. Dual-threat quarterback Jett Duffey will likely get his second career start for Tech after freshman Alan Bowman was hospitalized for the second time this season because of a partially collapsed lung. Bowman took a shot in Texas Tech's 51-46 home loss to No. 6 Oklahoma in another primetime game in Lubbock last week. The Red Raiders won their regular season finale at Texas last year, a win that likely saved coach Kliff Kingsbury's job.\n\nBEST MATCHUP\n\nBedlam in Norman. While Oklahoma State (5-4, 2-4) has been erratic this season, and has been dominated in the rivalry series, the Cowboys have made it to overtime in two of their last three road games against Oklahoma \u2014 they won there in 2014, after an OT loss in 2012. The Big 12 co-leading Sooners (8-1, 5-1) have scored at least 51 points in each of their three games since a 48-45 loss to Texas, which Oklahoma State beat two weeks ago before losing at Baylor last week.\n\nINSIDE THE NUMBERS\n\nIowa State takes a four-game winning streak into its game against Baylor, and will try to win five consecutive conference games in the same season. They won five Big Eight games in a row twice, both over multiple seasons in that former league (1960-61 and 1978-79). ... TCU has won four of six meetings against West Virginia since the two teams entered the Big 12 together in 2012. ... Oklahoma ranks 125th among FBS teams with only 63 offensive plays per game, but average 8.9 yards per play and rank second nationally with 563 total yards a game.\n\nLONG SHOT\n\nA farewell bowl game for outgoing Kansas coach David Beaty is unlikely. The Jayhawks can reach four wins for the first time since 2009 when they play at Kansas State, only a week after the school announced Beaty wouldn't return next year but would finish this season. Even with a win over K-State, they would still have to win their last two games against No. 6 Oklahoma and No. 15 Texas to get bowl eligible.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH\n\nWest Virginia quarterback Will Grier has thrown for 699 yards and six touchdowns without an interception in his last two games since that 100-yard passing game at Iowa State. The Heisman Trophy contender also ran for the game-winning 2-point conversion in the final minute at Texas last week.

Thompson wants to make Virginia a championship contender again. (Zach Wajsgras/The Daily Progress via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) \u2014 Tina Thompson has moved the blue sticky notes that used to cover the left side of her desk into a notebook to cut down on the clutter.\n\nThe Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer is focused on the one thing she knows well: Winning.\n\nIt's fitting she will make her head coaching debut against a top 10 opponent \u2014 No. 6 Mississippi State on Friday. Thompson embraces challenges, having worked hard for every accolade that has come her way.\n\nA two-time Olympic gold medalist, Thompson was the third-option \u2014 albeit arguably the best third option ever in the women's game \u2014 playing alongside Cynthia Cooper and Sheryl Swoopes during the Houston Comets WNBA championship run. She scored more than 1,500 points and had more than 1,000 rebounds at Morningside High School in Inglewood, California, before heading to USC \u2014 though she never quite stepped out of shadows of another Morningside and USC player before her: Lisa Leslie.\n\nThompson just continued to play her game, eventually becoming the No. 1 pick in the 1997 WNBA draft after averaging a double-double at USC.\n\nNow 43, Thompson wants to make Virginia a championship contender again \u2014 with the Cavaliers playing their game.\n\nWhich Thompson stresses will be up-tempo.\n\n\"We're still going to be a defensive team,\" Thompson said. \"I mean, it's something that we talk about daily but we need to score more so encouraging our team to be offensive-minded is something that I've done from Day One. I mean, we have to score points.\n\n\"Defense, for sure, wins championships, but it takes some points here and there to actually kind of secure those wins. Confidence in shooting the ball ... being comfortable and free-flowing and scoring the basketball, is very important. That is definitely a point of emphasis for us.\"\n\nVirginia finished 19-14 last season and reached the NCAA Tournament for the first time in nine seasons. The Cavaliers held opponents to 61.2 points per game. But they scored just 62.1 points per contest, and that's not enough for Thompson.\n\nThe core includes guard Dominique Toussaint, the leading returning scorer (11.4 ppg), forward Jocelyn Willoughby, who was No. 3 at 9.6 ppg, and 6-foot-9 center Felicia Aiyeotan, who scored 7.4 ppg, grabbed 6.9 rebounds per game and led the Atlantic Coast Conference with 69 blocked shots.\n\nThompson is not thinking about rebuilding, not with that trio of juniors.\n\n\"I think we're just contributing to a pretty solid foundation,\" Thompson said. \"We don't have to rebuild when you have a core like that. We just have to change the mindset. We're just giving it a face-lift, so to speak.\"\n\nA winning face-lift.\n\nIn her office, the back wall behind her desk includes a photograph blown up to mural size. The photo shows the opening tip of an early season game against Tennessee before a nearly packed house at Virginia's John Paul Jones Arena on Nov. 20, 2011.\n\nThe final score \u2014 Virginia 69, No. 3 Tennessee 64 \u2014 is super-imposed on the scoreboard.\n\n\"A couple of people have asked me if I was going to change that, and I was like, are you kidding me? Why would I?\" she said. \"This is the goal. This is the start. This is the foundation of what is Virginia.\"\n\nThompson, hired when a family matter caused Joanne Boyle to retire after last season, took over a program with a history of success. The Cavaliers went to the NCAA Tournament 20 consecutive seasons from 1983-2002 under Debbie Ryan, reached three Final Fours and lost 70-67 to the Lady Vols in overtime in the 1990-91 championship game.\n\nThompson spent the last three seasons as an assistant coach at Texas, and her impressive resume made her hiring an easy decision for Virginia athletic director Carla Williams, who also has a background in women's basketball. Williams played four seasons at Georgia and then worked as an assistant coach and top recruiter before altering her career path to get into the administrative side.\n\n\"I think what's important is to have a person like Tina who has been there and done that,\" Williams said. \"She is a living testament to championships and enthusiasm and winning. I just think that is a bonus. I think she'll be a great coach. I think she'll be a great recruiter and I think our players already adore her.\"\n\nAt Texas, one of Thompson's responsibilities was working with the Longhorns' post players, and the presence of Aiyeotan makes her arrival all the more intriguing. The native of Nigeria is the tallest player in the women's game, according to Virginia, but is still relatively new to basketball.\n\nAiyeotan has embraced how the 6-2 Thompson played the game.\n\n\"I told them that I didn't have the fanciest game and didn't look good, but it was not something that I ever worried about,\" Thompson said. \"I paid more attention to and was more conscious of my efficiency. Not taking bad shots. Taking the shot I made more times than not, and it wasn't an around the back, behind the basket finger-roll.\"\n\nAiyeotan, who rushed and missed many shots from in close last season, has taken the advice from \"Coach Tina\" to heart.\n\n\"I think it's really good for you to focus on the finishing,\" Aiyeotan said. \"That's what counts on the scoreboard and I think the more consistent you are, the more confident you get.\"\n\nShe doesn't have to wait to show how much she has learned. On Friday she'll face Mississippi State's 6-7 Teaira McCowan, who of most highly regarded post players in the women's game.\n\nAll of the Cavaliers are looking forward to hosting the sixth-ranked Bulldogs.\n\n\"We opened against them last year and that was a fun, exciting game,\" Willoughby said of the Cavaliers 68-53 loss in Starkville.\n\n\"And now they get to come to our house, so that makes it even better.\"\n\nThompson wouldn't want it any other way.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 Colton Sissons put an exclamation point on his run of success against the Colorado Avalanche.\n\nThe fifth-year center got his second career hat trick and Colorado had two apparent goals nullified by replay reviews as the Nashville Predators beat the Avalanche 4-1 Wednesday night.\n\n\"Everybody has a team or two they have success against and feel good against and fortunately for me, it's a team in our division,\" said Sissons, who has scored eight of his 26 career goals against Colorado. \"They are always tough games (against the Avs), like playoff games, and I like playing in those games. Maybe that's it.\"\n\nSissons' play has figured in an even bigger run of success by Nashville, which improved to 7-0 on the road this season and extended its regular-season winning streak against Colorado to 11 games.\n\n\"We just stay focused and do our thing,\" Sissons said. \"I don't know if being on the road and only focusing on the road helps us. But we've been sharp.\"\n\nRyan Hartman added an empty-net goal with 2:54 left for Nashville, which benefited from the nullified goals in sending Colorado to a fourth straight loss.\n\n\"We know how big it is,\" Nick Bonino said. \"Those were big challenges. The first one I think you could see; the second was a gusty call. It was game-changing.\"\n\nAvalanche coach Jared Bednar thought his team's poor execution might have contributed to the adverse rulings.\n\n\"I have to try and find the reviews that they have because to me, one could be inconclusive, maybe both, I don't know,\" Bednar said. \"But I think our execution was poor. Tape-to-tape passes we're throwing into guys' skates even when there aren't players in between them, going offside on goals. That's part execution, slows down our pace, slows down the tempo of our game.\n\n\"The two goals getting called back to me is just another aspect of our lack of execution.\"\n\nTrailing 2-0, the Avalanche had an apparent goal at 1:29 of the second period waived off after a replay review showed the puck had drifted across the blue line, making it offside. Samuel Girard was straddling the blue line when he passed to Ian Cole, whose shot zoomed into the net past goalie Pekka Rinne only to have it erased after the Predators' challenge was upheld.\n\nA second Avalanche goal was disallowed, on a shot by Colin Wilson, with 12:33 remaining in the third following a Predators challenge. Officials took away the score after the replay review, saying the Avs were offside when the play started.\n\nGirard was at the center of the only goal that counted for Colorado, a power-play score. He fired a pass down the middle of the ice that Matt Calvert redirected past Rinne to pull the Avalanche to 2-1 at 7:08 of the second period. The goal was upheld after a replay review.\n\nNashville rebuilt its lead on the power play. Kyle Turris, off a feed from Kevin Fiala, wristed a shot from inside the right circle that Sisson tipped into the net past goalie Semyon Varlamov for his third of the night at 19:57 of the second.\n\nSissons got the first two thirds of the hat trick in the first period. At 13:39 of the period, Varlamov stopped a shot from Bonino but the rebound trickled out and Sissons was there with his stick to tap it in.\n\nFour minutes later, Sissons gathered a cross-ice pass from Roman Josi and wristed a shot past Varlamov from in close.\n\nNOTES: Sissons has four multigoal games in his career, including his first hat trick last Jan. 5 against Tampa Bay. ...

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Ryan Getzlaf and the Anaheim Ducks appear to be turning things around after a two-week slump.\n\nThe Ducks got their second victory in three games Wednesday night as they defeated the Calgary Flames 3-2. Getzlaf supplied the game-winning goal in the third period 27 seconds after the Flames tied it while they were short-handed.\n\n\"We've been working hard to close out a couple of these games,\" said Getzlaf, who scored his second game-winning goal of the season and 49th of his career. \"It was pretty exciting. Emotions are high in this room.\"\n\nThe Ducks began the season 5-1-1 but managed only two points in their next seven games before a 3-2 overtime victory against Columbus on Sunday. Anaheim lost to Los Angeles 4-1 on Tuesday, but Getzlaf said it was good to get back on the ice quickly and put that defeat behind them.\n\nIt wasn't easy, though. Anaheim led 2-0 in the first but Calgary rallied to tie it six minutes into the third when Mark Jankowski stole the puck from Brandon Montour in the neutral zone and shot it just over Ryan Miller's glove while leading a 2-on-1 rush.\n\nThe Ducks, though, were quickly able to seize back momentum. Getzlaf corralled a loose puck in front and directed a backhand through Mike Smith's legs to snap the Flames' four-game winning streak.\n\n\"In the end we gutted it out in the third period and found a way,\" Anaheim coach Randy Carlyle said. \"I thought we started the right way. We didn't want to sit back and worry about what happened last night. It was more about being in the present.\"\n\nJakob Silfverberg and Adam Henrique also scored for Anaheim. Miller made 37 saves and tied Andy Moog (372) for 17th on the career wins list.\n\n\"He's a goalie I watched growing up,\" Miller said. \"I used to try to draw his helmet all the time on my street hockey helmet. It's pretty cool to be playing long enough to win enough games to be mentioned.\"\n\nCalgary pulled Smith for an extra skater with 2:28 remaining and then was on a power play for the final 74 seconds after Rickard Rakell was called for slashing. But the Flames were never able to get a clean shot on goal despite the two-man advantage.\n\n\"We had some good looks but I thought we needed to do a little more offensively,\" Calgary coach Bill Peters said. \"I liked our third period but we ended up chasing the game again here today.\"\n\nMatthew Tkachuk also scored for Calgary, which has won only once in its last 28 trips to Anaheim. Smith stopped 21 shots.\n\nThe Ducks got on the board at 8:37 of the first when Silfverberg carried the puck into the Calgary zone and ripped a slap shot for his fifth goal of the season. Henrique gave them a two-goal lead three minutes later when he pounced on a rebound after Smith stopped Josh Manson's shot from near the blue line.\n\nWith less than three minutes left in the first, Calgary scored on the power play when Tkachuk redirected Elias Lindholm's drive past Miller.\n\nNOTES: Anaheim D Jacob Larsson got an assist on Silfverberg's goal for his first NHL point. Larsson was the Ducks' first-round selection in the 2015 draft. ... The Ducks are 3-1 in the second game of back-to-backs ... Tkachuk has a point in four straight games, with two goals and four assists. ... Lindholm's assist extended his point streak to six games (three goals, six assists). ...

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Tyson Chandler savored the ovations when he first took the court in downtown Los Angeles. The cheers at the end were even sweeter.\n\nThe Lakers' newest big man got to represent his hometown Wednesday night for the first time in his 18 NBA seasons, and he came up bigger and better than even he expected in a hard-fought win.\n\nLeBron James had 24 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists, and Kyle Kuzma scored six of his 21 points in the final minutes of the Lakers' 114-110 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nJames, Kuzma and Josh Hart played major roles in the Lakers' third win in four games, but they all directed praise toward Chandler, who joined the Lakers on Tuesday after reaching a buyout agreement with Phoenix. After LA's savvy basketball fans welcomed Chandler to town with cheers, the veteran provided much of what the Lakers have been lacking this season.\n\n\"It's honestly all love,\" Chandler said. \"I love this city the way they love me. When you're homegrown from here and going to high school and all that and you've had these same fans, and now you represent the jersey that everybody has been cheering for their entire lives, you kind of become one. I've been on the other side and played the villain. Now it's great to be on this side and actually rep them.\"\n\nWith only a cursory knowledge of the Lakers' plays and schemes, Chandler still provided defense, rebounding and hard picks while playing a surprising 23 minutes.\n\nChandler's nine rebounds included two enormous offensive boards in the last minute. He then contested Derrick Rose's final 3-point attempt, forcing a miss that essentially sealed the win.\n\n\"You can tell he's a young-old guy that's happy to be back home, and he played with a lot of energy tonight,\" said Rajon Rondo, who was thanked by Chandler for vocally directing him around the court.\n\nHart scored 21 points and Brandon Ingram added 20 for the Lakers, who avenged a loss at Minnesota nine days earlier with a tenacious finish at Staples Center.\n\nKuzma's fourth 3-pointer put the Lakers up 111-104 with 1:51 to play, but Rose promptly hit back-to-back 3-pointers for the Wolves. After Chandler twice extended the Lakers' ensuing possession, Kuzma hit one of two free throws with 9.5 seconds left.\n\nRose then missed his last 3 under heavy defensive pressure from Chandler, and Hart hit two free throws to seal it. Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau thought Rose deserved a foul.\n\n\"They're not going to give me that call,\" Rose said with a shrug. \"They haven't been giving me that call, so I've just got to get used to it.\"\n\nRose scored 31 points and Jimmy Butler added 24 for the Timberwolves, who dropped to 0-7 on the road this season with their fourth consecutive loss overall. Minnesota had won five straight over the Lakers.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nTimberwolves: Butler converted a four-point play to tie it at 94 with 7:44 to play. ... Thibodeau used the same starting lineup from Monday's loss to the Clippers.\n\nLakers: James fell just shy of his 75th triple-double, but scored nine points in the fourth quarter. ... Chandler grew up in several parts of California before moving to Compton, where he starred at Dominguez High School and became the No. 2 pick in the 2001 NBA draft. ... Chandler backed up JaVale McGee, who had 16 points on 8-of-10 shooting.\n\nGOOD STARTS\n\nMinnesota came out in an offensive groove during its second straight game at Staples Center following Monday's loss to the Clippers. All five Wolves starters reached double figures in the first half while hitting 66 percent of their shots. Rose and Wiggins hit three 3-pointers apiece and all five starters contributed to an 11-for-17 performance beyond the arc, tying the franchise record for 3s in a first half.\n\nBut the Lakers didn't get humiliated in the first quarter, as they did last Sunday in their loss to Toronto. Hart hit four 3-pointers in the first half, and Kuzma hit a buzzer-beating 3 to limit Minnesota's lead to 67-65.\n\nBAD BOARDS\n\nMinnesota was outrebounded 47-40, and it was most glaring in that final minute. \"Very, very frustrating to know we were that close, and all we have to do is rebound the basketball,\" Butler said. \"But that's been the story for us so far. We've been right there. We've been outrebounded. We have to figure out a way to go get the ball.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTimberwolves: At the Sacramento Kings on Friday night.\n\nLakers: At the Sacramento Kings on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: www.apnews.com/NBA and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He's trying to stay focused on the nuances of coach Nick Nurse's offense.\n\nOnce that happens, Leonard says, the Raptors will really get rolling.\n\nLeonard had 25 points and 11 rebounds in his return from an ankle injury, and Toronto beat the Sacramento Kings 114-105 on Wednesday night.\n\nPascal Siakam scored 21 points, Serge Ibaka had 14 points and 14 rebounds, and Kyle Lowry added 16 points and eight assists for the Raptors.\n\n\"This isn't our ceiling,\" Leonard said. \"With me not even knowing some of the offense, we have Kyle in the game most of the time.

Reports state that markets were up following 06 Nonember 2018 mid-term elections in the United States. EPA-EFE/JUSTIN LANE ORG XMIT: JLX02 (Photo: JUSTIN LANE, EPA-EFE)\n\nAs stock market reactions go, the rally on Wednesday following news of a divided U.S. government was about as far from a scary Brexit-like moment as you could get.\n\nPower, politics and money collided following the Nov. 6 midterm elections, as the Democrats snatched back control of the House, prompting stocks to do what they have historically done once election uncertainty fades and clarity over the outcome emerges: They rose.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average and broader Standard & Poor's 500 index each rallied more than 2 percent on Wednesday, the first full day of trading following the midterms.\n\n\"Markets like certainty, which we now have, and the split result is what (Wall Street) expected,\" says Thorne Perkin, president of Papamarkou Wellner Asset Management in New York.\n\nSo what comes next for markets? And what does the shifting political landscape mean for 401(k) investors and their money?\n\nMidterm election's bullish past\n\nLooking at the big picture, history shows that the midterm elections act as a launching pad for stocks. The S&P 500, for example, has been higher a year after every midterm election since World War II. It's been a perfect 18 for 18.\n\nAnd over the past 50 years, the large-company stock index has risen an average 16 percent in the year after a midterm vote, according to Capital Economics.\n\nThe Dow also tends to go into rally mode after the midterm votes are counted. The blue-chip stock average has risen 4 percent, on average, in the fourth quarter of midterm years and followed that up with gains of 5.2 and 3.6 percent in the following two quarters, according to LPL Research. That nine-month stretch is the best of the four-year \"presidential cycle.\"\n\n\"The outcomes (of the midterms) matter less than the end of the campaign,\" explains Kate Warne, market strategist at Edward Jones.\n\nGridlock is also good\n\nEven though Republican President Donald Trump's colleagues in the GOP lost control of the House in Tuesday's election, divided government, Wall Street history shows, can lead to strong market returns. That's mainly because legislation that might get in the way of economic growth or make it harder for companies to make money never gets passed.\n\n\"Historically, divided governments have been good for markets,\" says Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network.\n\nWhy?\n\n\"There's no real policy changes, as Republicans and Democrats can't agree on much,\" he says.\n\nThe new balance of power in Washington, D.C., points toward a positive market reaction. The S&P 500 has gained 10.8 percent, on average, when there is a Republican president and the breakdown in Congress is a Republican-controlled Senate and a Democrat-led House, data from Strategas Research Partners show.\n\nMore Money: Stocks jump on midterm vote that results in divided Congress as Dems regain House\n\nMore Money: Mortgage applications fall to 4-year low as homebuyers exit housing market\n\nMore Money: Tax planning: 6 ways to lower the amount you owe\n\nSector by sector pros and cons\n\nStocks in certain segments of the market received a boost because laws detrimental to their profitability, which might have gotten enacted without gridlock, are now likely to end up on the chopping block.\n\nFor example, the fact that a \"blue wave\" \u2013 or Democratic sweep of both chambers of Congress \u2013 didn't happen has given fresh life to many pharmaceutical stocks that might have been hurt by a Democratic push to reign in high prescription drug prices. On Wednesday, drug maker Eli Lilly jumped nearly 4 percent and health insurer Humana rallied 6.5 percent. Shares of medical equipment maker DaVita jumped more than 10 percent after California voters rejected a proposal that would have limited the amount clinics could charge for dialysis treatments.\n\nOn the flip side, the fact that Democrats regained control of the House has provided a boost to hospital stocks and insurers as it is less likely that the Republicans will be able to roll back the Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare.\n\nOn Wednesday, shares of hospitals such as HCA Healthcare (up nearly 5 percent) and Universal Health Services (which gained 2.6 percent) were big winners.\n\n\"Gridlock is likely to be a positive for health care stocks,\" says Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy for J.P. Morgan Asset Management. The reason: On their own, each political party might be more inclined to make more substantial changes to the health care system. \"But now that won't happen,\" Cembalest says.\n\nSimilarly, with hopes rising for the Democrats and Republicans getting together and agreeing to a spending bill to improve the nations's infrastructure, stocks of companies that would benefit from a repair of streets and bridges rallied sharply.\n\nGranite Construction, a company that builds roads, highways and bridges, rallied nearly 13 percent, while shares of asphalt and concrete maker Vulcan Materials rose nearly 5 percent.\n\nVotes at the state level also had big impacts on sectors, such as energy. In Colorado, voters rejected a bill that would have restricted new oil and gas drilling near areas deemed \"vulnerable.\"\n\nThe no vote, says Jeff Henriksen, CEO and co-founder of hedge fund Thorpe Abbotts Capital, is \"undoubtedly positive\" for drilling companies such as Anadarko Petroleum and Noble Energy, he said. Shares of Anadarko on Wednesday jumped nearly 6 percent and Noble rose more than 4 percent.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/08/midterm-election-stock-market-impact/1920273002/", "Walmart is offering shoppers a digital map to help find its Black Friday deals.

Top Facebook execs have said it would take at least a year, if not longer, to fix these issues.\n\nStill, Bosworth says of Portal, \"...this is the product you want. It's exclusively focused on connecting you with the people you care about the most. This is dedicated to having you stay close to them.\"\n\nPortal has a built-in camera that can intuitively follow you around the room and uses the Facebook Messenger platform for making calls.\n\nNow Facebook freely admits that it tracks the frequency and length of Messenger calls and that \"some of this information may be used for advertising purposes. For example, we may use the fact that you make lots of video calls to inform some of the ads you see.\"\n\nOn top of that, Facebook, like Amazon and Google, records every query you make to the speaker \u2013 to learn how to answer correctly \u2013 and stores the audio of the requests.

USA TODAY\n\nFemale domestic workers, candidate talked criminal justice, other reforms key to black community.\n\nStacey Abrams on the campaign trail in Rincon, GA one day before the elections. (Photo: Jack Gruber/USA TODAY Network)\n\nWomen of color owned Tuesday's midterms \u2014 making history in congressional races across the country. Wins ushered in the first Native American and Somali women.\n\nAnd, even if it falls short, Stacey Abrams' battle for Georgia governor is already a significant victory.\n\nShe made history by becoming the first black female nominee for the office from a major political party in the state. And in red-leaning Georgia (which President Donald Trump won in 2016), the fact that her campaign was effective enough to make the race so close says a tremendous amount about the power of her messaging.\n\nGrassroots campaigning, led by women of color, made Abrams a contender and signals growing political power among black women in America.\n\nIt's that organizing \u2014 rooted in the history of black, female domestic workers in the deep south \u2014 that still has the potential to push Abrams to victory if she advances to a runoff election against Republican candidate Brian Kemp. (As of this posting, Kemp was ahead by about 70,000 votes. And Abrams vowed not to concede until all of the absentee and contentious provisional ballots were counted.)\n\nGrassroots organizing\n\nAbrams' formula for advancement isn't unprecedented. Women, especially black women, pushed for and voted the issues. Black female domestic workers knocked on doors and talked to voters about criminal justice reform, health care and the fight for the dignity and economic prosperity of black families and children.\n\nBlack women have always been critical to building political power, especially in the south. In the 1960s, Dorothy Lee Bolden gave rise to the modern-day domestic workers movement in Atlanta, organizing black house cleaners, nannies and care workers in the fight for their rights at work and the voting booth. To be a member of the National Domestic Workers Union, you had to register to vote. Bolden knew that economic power and political power were bound together, and she demanded both for domestic workers.\n\nThis year, as the push to suppress the vote in Georgia came to the fore, black domestic workers pressed on. As an electorate, black women are powerful. We have had some of the highest voting rates in the country, and have consistently shown up for progressive and Democratic candidates.\n\nIn Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial race and Alabama\u2019s special Senate election in 2017, black women voters made the difference.\n\nGeorgia is no different. Amid ongoing reports of massive voter suppression, voter intimidation, and malfunctioning voting machines across the state \u2014 all of which disproportionately impacted black communities \u2014 voters continued to show up at the polls in record numbers.\n\nAt a campaign stop last week in Atlanta, former president Barack Obama proclaimed, \"I\u2019ve heard about the domestic workers right here in Georgia mobilizing for Stacey like never before. Folks that earn their living cleaning other people\u2019s homes, taking care of other people\u2019s kids. If they're not too tired to vote, you better not be.\"\n\nObama is right \u2014 it's black women who, in many instances, have the most at stake when it comes to reforms. And in Georgia, they were heavily invested in campaigning for a governor who would put their interests front and center.\n\nAbrams focused on issues \u2014 health care, reproductive rights and criminal justice reform \u2014 that domestic workers and other women of color throughout the state struggle with every day.\n\nHigh participation for black and female voters\n\nEarly voters in Georgia turned out in record numbers \u2014 more than 2 million participated. Black voters and female voters took an early lead, according to numbers reported last month (when early voting began) in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nAt that time, more than 40 percent of early voters were African American (yet they make up less than a third of registered voters statewide) and nearly 60 percent were women.\n\nThough they are not often the most visible in our society, domestic workers powered the grassroots energy for female candidates of color.\n\nAnd as their work continues, they will expand opportunities for diverse voices \u2014 from the young mom working multiple jobs to provide for her family to the barbershop owner looking to pay his employees a living wage \u2014 at the tables of power.\n\nThe significance of Abrams' candidacy cannot be overstated. Nor can the efforts of the domestic workers who are hungry for a change in our political establishment.\n\nThey are a living example of what democracy can and will look like for our nation. They are blazing and sustaining a trail for candidates like Abrams in Georgia and women across the country. It is about time others started paying attention.\n\nAlicia Garza is a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, a principal at Black Futures Lab and an adviser for Care in Action, the policy and advocacy organization for more than 2 million domestic workers across America.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/policing/politics-policing/2018/11/07/stacey-abrams-domestic-workers-policing-usa-midterm-elections/1906753002/", "", "TCU guard Alex Robinson (25) and Cal State Bakersfield guard Jarkel Joiner (0) battle for the ball during the second half of an NCAA college basketball game, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018, in Fort Worth, Texas.

(AP Photo/Brandon Wade) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) \u2014 Desmond Bane and No. 20 TCU didn't get off to great start in their first opener as a ranked team in 20 seasons. They finished with a victory.\n\nBane scored 13 of his 14 points after halftime, when the Horned Frogs rallied to beat Cal State Bakersfield 66-61 on Wednesday night after trailing by as many as 11 points.\n\n\"Just kind of stuck with it,\" Bane said. \"There were times when other people were getting open looks in the first half and I just felt like it was kind of falling my way in the second half.\"\n\nBane's tiebreaking driving layup with 2:48 left finally put TCU ahead to stay. Bane also had 10 rebounds.\n\nThe Horned Frogs fell behind early in their first opener as a ranked team since 1998-99.

I think our effort and our play today was a program game. I think our program just what we've done over the last four or five years brought us here with confidence.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nCal State Bakersfield has nine players on its roster who previously redshirted a season, matching the most in the nation. Joiner is a sophomore guard from Oxford, Mississippi, where Barnes was an All-SEC guard as a player for Ole Miss in 1988 before later becoming the SEC Coach of the Year for the Rebels.

Durham had a layup and Lee a jumper before each had a 3-pointer in a 34-second span to prompted Dixon to call timeout. The Roadrunners went up 29-18 lead on Taze Moore's alley-oop dunk from Greg Lee less than 12 minutes into the game.\n\nAfter making 13 of 25 shots (52 percent) before halftime, they made only 8 of 33 (24 percent) after that.\n\n\"You're also talking about a tournament team,\" Barnes said of TCU. \"They're going to figure out ways to try to win a game.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCal State Bakersfield plays its home opener Friday against Antelope Valley, the only time the Roadrunners will be at home until Dec. 4.\n\nTCU is playing its first six games at home, the next Sunday against Oral Roberts.

(AP Photo/Brandon Dill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 In a season when NBA teams are scoring more and playing faster on offense, the Memphis Grizzlies are taking the opposite approach \u2014 relying on their defense.\n\nThat certainly proved successful Wednesday night against the Denver Nuggets.\n\nMarc Gasol scored 20 points, including the go-ahead free throws with 4.6 seconds remaining, and Memphis edged the Nuggets 89-87 to end their five-game winning streak.\n\nThe Nuggets (9-2) had a chance after Gasol's foul shots, but Nikola Jokic's 3-point attempt bounced off the rim and Denver's rebound tip was also off the mark.\n\nMemphis held the Nuggets to 39 percent shooting, including 8 of 32 from 3-point range. The 87 points were a season low for the Nuggets, and the 176 points combined by the teams tied for the fewest in an NBA game this season.\n\n\"We knew it was going to be an ugly game if we were going to have a chance of winning,\" Grizzlies guard Mike Conley said. \"We tried to get in the mud a little bit, be physical defensively and get the pace where we wanted it.\"\n\nJaren Jackson Jr. also had 20 points for Memphis, and Kyle Anderson finished with 14. Gasol grabbed 12 rebounds.\n\nGary Harris led the Nuggets with 20 points, and Trey Lyles added 16 off the bench. Jamal Murray had 15 points and seven assists after scoring a career-best 48 in Monday night's win over Boston.\n\nMurray shot only 6 of 21 this time.\n\n\"I don't know what it was, but the ball didn't like me today,\" Murray said.\n\nDenver was up 83-82 before Memphis took the lead on a 3-pointer by Shelvin Mack with 1:45 left. Conley hit a floater with 40 seconds to go, but Lyles' dunk and a 22-foot jumper by Murray tied it at 87 before Gasol's winning free throws.\n\nMemphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff told his team he wanted to get back to a defensive mentality and force opponents to fight through low-scoring games if they want to beat the Grizzlies.\n\n\"That's exactly what this win represents,\" Memphis guard Garrett Temple said. \"Holding this team \u2014 as hot as they've been \u2014 to 87 points at home ... it was a big win for us.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nNuggets: Murray was limited to seven points on 3-of-10 shooting in the first half. He missed his first four 3-pointers before converting one near the 9-minute mark of the third quarter. ... Jokic, who averages 11 shots a game, took just one \u2014 his 3-point try in the closing seconds. \"I'll have to look at the tape to see what they are doing for him to only take one shot,\" coach Michael Malone said. \"Obviously, I would like him to take more shots, but right now he isn't shooting the ball and we will have to figure out why.\"\n\nGrizzlies: Committed eight turnovers in the first quarter and finished with 18, compared to 19 for Denver. Memphis has had fewer turnovers than its opponent in every game this season. ... The Grizzlies (6-4) are 4-0 at home. . Gasol and Jackson had three blocks each. Jackson also made three steals.\n\nPACE OF PLAY\n\nThe game was a contrast of styles, with Memphis relying on its slower-pace defensive approach against a Denver team that entered averaging almost 112 points per game.\n\n\"They definitely got us into their game,\" Nuggets reserve center Mason Plumlee said, later adding: \"It was a slow, slow game, so I think that benefited them.\"\n\nConley acknowledged Memphis can score 130 points in a game, but: \"Defensively, I do think this is what you should expect from us.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNuggets: Host the Brooklyn Nets on Friday.\n\nGrizzlies: At the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Nationals made an offer to Harper late in the season in an attempt to reach a deal before he became a free agent. Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo disclosed the talks with agent Scott Boras at the general managers' meetings on Tuesday, Nov. 6. (AP Photo/Nick Wass, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The agent for free agent Bryce Harper and many of baseball's top players claims rebuilding teams have become a \"competitive cancer\" that caused this season's 4 percent attendance drop.\n\nAs the sport's officials start to consider possible rules changes to spark offense and speed up play, Scott Boras acidly critiqued several clubs that were among the 17 to draw fewer fans this year than last.\n\nBoras pointed out Louisiana State's baseball team had a higher average attendance for its 37 home games than the Miami Marlins did for their 81 \u2014 10,786 to 10,014.\n\n\"The fans of Florida have certainly brought the MIA to Miami,\" he said Wednesday in a courtyard outside the general managers' meetings.\n\nHe claimed when \"the divisional clubs come to Minnesota, it's gotten so bad that only one of the Twins shows up.\"\n\nAnd he criticized the Toronto Blue Jays, who had the biggest decrease in the major leagues this year, falling by 878,000 fans to 2.33 million.\n\n\"They've lost near a third of their fan base due to the blue flu of not bringing attractive players the fans find interesting to their market,\" he said.\n\nBoras has self interest in encouraging spending, wanting fewer clubs jettisoning veterans in favor of youth and more handing out lucrative contracts \u2014 especially to his clients.\n\nMajor League Baseball's average attendance dropped to 28,830, its lowest since 2003 after 14 consecutive seasons topping 30,000, and six ballparks set record lows. Boras connected the drop to non-competitive clubs: There were three 100-loss teams for the second time since 1985 and the first since a record four in 2002. And there were eight 95-loss teams for the first time in big league history.\n\n\"The reality of it is they're losing their fan base, and it costs millions and millions of dollars to rebuild the fan base,\" he said.\n\nBoras is seeking a record contract for Harper, topping outfielder Giancarlo Stanton's $325 million, 13-year deal through 2027 reached with the Miami Marlins, who traded him to the New York Yankees last December. Boras sounded as if he had rehearsed his zingers like a stand-up comedian.\n\n\"Certainly Harper's bazaar has begun,\" he said. \"It's fashionable. It's historical. It's elite. It's global, certainly. And certainly it has inspirations that deal with great shoes and great hair.\"\n\nWashington made a late-season offer before Harper became a free agent at the unusually young age of 26. Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said Harper didn't respond.\n\n\"He's going to go about his business and we're going to go about our business,\" Rizzo said. \"We drafted, signed, developed him. He turned into one of the best players in the league with our uniform on.\"\n\nWhile GMs meet with each other and agents, the formal sessions deal with the mechanics of the sport, and Commissioner Rob Manfred and his staff are concerned about the drop in offense and rise in strikeouts. The big league batting average fell seven points to .248, its lowest since 1972 \u2014 the last season before the American League adopted the designated hitter.\n\nStrikeouts set a record for the 11th straight year and topped hits for the first time in big league history.\n\n\"I think fans like the ball in play a little bit more,\" Chicago Cubs president of baseball operations Theo Epstein said. \"I embrace MLB's efforts to think about how to steer the game towards the most compelling product for the fans. If that involves the ball in play more, then you find some subtle ways to influence that.\"\n\nLos Angeles Angels general manager Billy Eppler doesn't think alterations are needed.\n\n\"I think we should embrace it. I don't think we should fight it,\" he said. \"Why are people striking out more? Probably because pitchers are throwing about 3 1/2 miles an hour harder than they were seven years ago. People are getting better with their breaking ball. There's more technology in the game. And you can really accurately decide where you want to throw a baseball and practice that for particular hitters.\"\n\nAs many teams rotate the back end of their bullpens with their Triple-A teams to have more depth for each game, innings per starting pitcher dropped to 5.36 from 5.51 last year and 5.89 in 2012, and relievers per team per game rose to 3.4 from 3.2 last year and 3.0 in 2012. Tampa Bay started experimenting with a relief pitcher as an \"opener\" instead of a traditional starter, a move adopted by Oakland and Milwaukee even in the playoffs.\n\nMore discussion is likely when owners meet next week in Atlanta, and the players' association appears open to at least consider changes \u2014 a stark change from its near-constant refusal in recent years. But first MLB must formulate what it wants to propose, a process likely to stretch through next month's winter meetings in Las Vegas and possibly into January.\n\n\"We live in a time where we expect answers very quickly, and I think we have to remember that in baseball history there have been many different eras, many styles of baseball that have been played,\" Philadelphia GM Matt Klentak said. \"A dead-ball era occurs, and then teams begin to adjust their behavior, and all of a sudden you hit more home runs. And then teams adjust, and speed and defense takes over the game more. And then teams try to exploit all the PITCHf/x data and the TrackMan data. The game will naturally ebb and flow. To some degree we need to have patience with the game and let it evolve naturally. It will.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Bernie Wilson contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

And they had lost eight straight at Indiana, dating to a victory on April 17, 2013.\n\nSo just three nights after an inexplicable 25-point loss at Brooklyn, Embiid, Simmons and their teammates felt right at home in one of coach Brent Brown's favorite NBA arenas.\n\nEmbiid collected his league-high 11th double-double on what he called an off night. Simmons had 16 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists and Dario Saric scored a season-high 18 points by going 4 for 6 on 3-pointers.\n\nAnd they did it by simply sticking to the plan.\n\nThey quickly jumped to a 19-9 lead, weathered Indiana's rally, then regained control by closing the third quarter on a 6-1 flurry and opened the fourth with a decisive 16-7 run.

Oshie during the Pittsburgh Penguins' 2-1 loss at the Washington Capitals.\n\nTwo people with direct knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press that Malkin would not face a hearing with the NHL department of player safety and therefore won't be suspended. The people spoke on condition of anonymity Thursday because the league does not announce the lack of a hearing.\n\nWith Pittsburgh on the power play early in the third period, Malkin passed the puck and lifted his right shoulder into Oshie's head and kept skating. The officials conferred before deciding to give Malkin a five-minute major penalty for an illegal check to the head and eject him from Wednesday night's game.\n\nOshie, who returned and scored the game-winner with 1:14 left, was not mad at Malkin for what he perceived to be an accident.\n\n\"He maybe thought I was coming to hit him and so he threw the reverse shoulder out there, which I try to do that all the time,\" Oshie said. \"I just wasn't expecting it being on the PK.\"\n\nLeague officials agreed with Oshie's assumption that Malkin was bracing for contact, not trying to deliver a vicious headshot. Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said after the game he was not concerned about the star Russian center facing further discipline, though Washington's Todd Reirden left open the possibility.\n\n\"That's definitely a blow to the head,\" Reirden said. \"Those are things we're trying to remove from the game. ... We're just really fortunate that it wasn't something that was more serious and he was able to come back.\"\n\nMalkin, the Penguins' leading scorer, will be eligible to play Saturday against the Arizona Coyotes. Pittsburgh has lost five in a row and has just one point during that stretch.\n\nCapitals goaltender Braden Holtby stopped 41 of the 42 shots he faced for his first win since Oct. 22. He got some help from the post on almost a half-dozen occasions, but Holtby also turned in his best performance of the season.\n\n\"I felt comfortable as the game moved on,\" Holtby said. \"I got some breaks, too, early on. The posts obviously was a break we weren't getting in the past.\"\n\nHoltby kept the Capitals in the game, and Oshie provided the heroics. He left the game early in the first period after taking a stick to the face from Penguins defenseman Olli Maatta and needed two stitches to close a cut next to his left eye.\n\nOshie returned for the second period but had to leave again after the hit from Malkin. He returned for the second time with about five minutes remaining.\n\n\"My face is a little messed up, but I'm feeling pretty good now,\" Oshie said. \"He caught me there, and it is what it is. I passed my concussion test, went out and won the game.\"\n\nPittsburgh outshot Washington 42-22 and got 20 saves from Casey DeSmith in his first career start against the Capitals. He was powerless to stop Oshie's goal after a pass from John Carlson gave him a wide-open net.\n\nLate in a sloppy game full of turnovers and whiffs on the puck, Oshie just wanted to make sure he didn't shoot so high he missed the net. After missing most of the first and third periods, Oshie made the most of his only shot in 13:51 of ice time.\n\n\"I barely saw him on the bench there,\" center Nicklas Backstrom said. \"He came back right in time.

USA TODAY\n\nJeff Session's recusal was a great service to Trump, yet Trump never forgave him. Acting Attorney General Whitaker will be tested like Sessions was.\n\nFormer Attorney General Jeff Sessions in Washington, D.C., on March 6, 2017. (Photo: Mandel Ngan)\n\nIn the Shakespearean drama known as the Trump administration, the Jeff Sessions is the ultimate tragic figure undone by doing the right thing. His epitaph could accurately borrow a line from King Lear: \u201cI am a man more sinned against than sinning.\u201d\n\nSessions was the first powerful Republican and U.S. Senator to support Donald Trump. However, his greatest service to Trump was the act that Trump never forgave him for: his recusal from the Russian investigation. The fact that Trump still does not seem to appreciate how Sessions helped him is precisely why this resignation is so unnerving. The appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general only magnifies those concerns.\n\nWhen Sessions was nominated, some of us immediately said that he should recuse himself since he played a key role in the campaign. Sessions did not immediately do so but rather waited for a full review of career ethics experts at the Justice Department. That review came to the same conclusion that a recusal was needed to protect the integrity of his department and the investigation.\n\nTrump began crisis by firing Comey\n\nThe recusal snowballed in significance after Trump unwisely fired then FBI Director James Comey. I was highly skeptical of the need for a special counsel until Trump fired Comey. Trump insiders have stated that only Jared Kushner supported firing Comey, but Trump still gave the order. Had he stayed quiet and allowed the FBI to complete its investigation, he would have been likely cleared in short order. However, that firing left little question that a special counsel was needed. That had nothing to do with Sessions.\n\nEven then, Trump should have seen the benefit of the recusal. There is still no direct criminal evidence against Trump of obstruction or collusion. By recusing himself, Sessions guaranteed that such a conclusion would be untainted by questions of improper influence. Instead, Trump began his campaign of self-defeating attacks on Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nTrump clearly wanted Sessions to bring the investigation to a rapid close and to refuse to appoint a special counsel. That would have required Sessions to shut down an investigation that was already pursuing possible criminal charges. That could well have cascaded from a threat of weak prosecution into a strong impeachment.\n\nMore: Jeff Sessions\u2019 firing poses grave threat to Robert Mueller inquiry\n\nFlashback: Trump political protection plan is replace Sessions with Mueller saboteur\n\nTwo more years of this? Donald Trump spars with media during press conference\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s continual abuse of Sessions, the attorney general continued to advance his agenda in every other way. Indeed, Sessions has been one of the most aggressive cabinet members in reshaping the policies of his department to push through Trump\u2019s policies on immigration, criminal justice and a host of other areas.\n\nThe lesson not learned from Sessions could still prove lethal for this president. The appointment of Whitaker may well indicate a worrisome failure of comprehension. Whitaker has previously suggested that an acting attorney general could kill Mueller\u2019s investigation without actually firing him. He has also been critical of the investigation.\n\nWhitaker's appointment could still snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory. Mueller is clearly winding down his investigation. While there are some possible subjects (like Donald Trump Jr. and Trump confidante Roger Stone) who may be facing serious threats, Trump is unlikely to be indicted or even implicated in collusion or obstruction. If Whitaker acts to limit Mueller at this point, it could raise new concerns for obstruction.\n\nMoreover, Whitaker could well receive Mueller\u2019s report and refuse to send the report to Congress or approve new charges. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, Whittaker can serve without Senate confirmation for 210 days. That would mean serving until June 2019 \u2013 well beyond the expected date for the submission of the report. Finally, Whitaker could mirror a hardline approach with the new White House counsel in refusing investigatory demands from the new Democratic-controlled House.\n\nThe longer Whitaker serves, the more suspicious\n\nWhitaker could use the next seven months to move the Justice Department into a fully bunkered position with regard to the Special Counsel and congressional investigations. He could then hand over the department to a nominee to become the permanent Attorney General. The longer he serves in this position, the more likely he will be viewed as a cynical choice. There is no reason why a new attorney general nominee could not be selected in January and, with a strong Republican majority in the Senate, such a nomination could move swiftly to confirmation. Continuing with an acting attorney general for an artificially long period would add suspicions that Whitaker was selected as a type of one-trick pony.\n\nNone of this means that Trump is about to repeat his mistakes from the start of his administration. In his press conference, Trump said that he does not intend to cut short the investigation despite his contempt for it. Moreover, while Rosenstein would have been the natural choice as acting attorney general, Rosenstein\u2019s own serious conflicts of interest (and baffling failure to recuse himself as a witness in the investigation) makes his selection problematic. Finally, Whitaker is likely to allow Mueller to continue and could well defer to him on criminal charges in conformity with prior Department special investigations.\n\nThis brings us back to lesson of Sessions. For the president, the lesson was appointing someone who put the ethics rules of justice over the interests of the president. If Whitaker is viewed as the anti-Sessions, that could put him in a very difficult position within weeks. The greatest test for Whitaker could come if Mueller proposes an indictment of someone like Trump Jr. or a report with damaging evidence against President Trump.

(AP Photo/John Raoux) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nORLANDO, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Detroit center Andre Drummond has expanded his offensive game dramatically.\n\nDrummond had 23 points and 19 rebounds and the Pistons beat the Orlando Magic 103-96 on Wednesday night to snap a five-game losing streak.\n\nDrummond hit 10 of 16 shots, including a buzzer-beating 3-pointer at the end of the first quarter, and nailed both free throw attempts. He scored 19 points in the first half, then set picks and chased down offensive rebounds for teammates in the final two periods.\n\n\"Andre was the player of the game for me,\" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. \"The way he competed, just playing hard. Not one play was called for him, but he's not worried about touches. He just goes out and plays his butt off and once we all get in our mind what the important things are to win in this league, we're going to be OK.\"\n\nThe Pistons were especially good at the end of each quarter and needed it to squeeze out a win.\n\nDetroit rallied from a 15-point first quarter and 11-point third quarter deficits to keep within tracking distance of the Magic.\n\nAfter allowing Orlando to pull to 94-93 with 2:58 left in the game, Detroit ran off nine straight points to seal their first win on this six-game trip.\n\n\"We've been struggling with finishing quarters, letting teams go on runs and it's been killing us,\" said reserve Langston Galloway, who had 12 points and six rebounds. \"For us to finish out those quarters was big.\"\n\nEvan Fournier led Orlando with 27 points, D.J. Augustin had 16, Aaron Gordon 15 and Nikola Vucevic 14, but the Magic's bench was dismal. Terrence Ross had 15 points, but the rest of the reserves combined to shoot 1-for-14 with 11 turnovers between them.\n\n\"The starters were really good and the bench was ... whoa!\" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. \"They were bad, I mean really, really bad, not competitive in either half. That makes it hard to win in this league. Guys have to be professional and be ready to play. The bench was embarrassing, that's it.\"\n\nFournier hit three straight shots and Aaron Gordon added a dunk to pull Orlando to 94-93 with 2:58 left. Griffin made a pair of free throws to start a 9-0 run for Detroit that Jackson finished with a 3-pointer and a layup.\n\nThe Magic opened the third period with three straight 3-pointers and a 27-9 run to take a 78-67 lead,\n\nDetroit, as it did the first two periods, rallied in the final minute to get control. Griffin hit a 3-pointer and a layup and Ish Smith had a block and breakaway layup at the buzzer that made it 80-78,\n\nTIP-INS\n\nPistons: Drummond has 19 or more rebounds in three of the last four games. ... Detroit has attempted a team-record 328 3-pointers in its first 10 games. ... The backups had a plus-82 rating in the game.\n\nMagic: The Magic started the fourth quarter 0 for 7 from the field and committed seven turnovers. ... Orlando got two four-point plays in the first half, one from Ross and another from Augustin. ... The Magic bench had a minus-110 rating.\n\nISAAC CONCERNS\n\nOrlando hasn't seen much of a return on Jonathan Isaac, the sixth pick in the 2017 draft. Isaac missed 55 games his rookie year with ankle problems. He started the first eight Magic games this season, but missed the last three with another sprained ankle. He took some shots during practice Wednesday, is not expected to play for at least another week. \"It's important we handle this the right way so it's not one of those things where he plays two games and it's sore and he has to miss one,\" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. \"Hopefully he'll feel 100 percent and then just play injury free or pain free the rest of the season.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPistons: Finish a six-game trip at Atlanta on Friday night.\n\nMagic: Host Washington Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Jackson dribbles the ball up the court during the second half of an NCAA college basketball game against Cincinnati, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018, in Cincinnati. Ohio State won 64-56. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Ohio State knew what awaited when the Buckeyes agreed to help Cincinnati reopen its on-campus arena. It was even louder than expected until the closing seconds, when the Bearcats fans were silently filing out.\n\nWith a solid effort, the visitors from up north spoiled the party.\n\nKaleb Wesson scored 15 points, and C.J. Jackson hit a driving bank shot and a pair of free throws in the final 30 seconds Wednesday night as Ohio State held on for a 64-56 victory on the Bearcats' long-awaited night.\n\n\"I thought it would be a great environment,\" coach Chris Holtmann said. \"I don't know that I anticipated this environment \u2014 it was tremendous. I'm sure at times it was not always aesthetically pleasing, two defensive teams that struggled a little offensively.\"\n\nCincinnati (0-1) played last season at Northern Kentucky University \u2014 losing only once \u2014 while its on-campus arena underwent a 20-month renovation. The Bearcats held a pregame celebration \u2014 former Bearcat star Kenyon Martin roused the crowd of 12,012 with a dunk \u2014 but couldn't make a shot when it counted.\n\nThe Buckeyes (1-0) were ahead for all but the opening minutes, leading by as many as 16 points. Jarron Cumberland led the Bearcats with 22 points.\n\n\"It hurts a lot,\" said Cumberland, who was 0 for 3 and failed to score as Ohio State took control in the first half. \"I don't like losing, period. It doesn't matter if it's the first game.\"\n\nOhio State hadn't played in Cincinnati since Jan. 3, 1920, with the Buckeyes winning 35-13. The two schools located 110 miles apart had played only four times in the last 97 years, all in tournaments.\n\nOhio State went 25-9 in Holtmann's first season, an unexpected showing that won him Big Ten coach of the year honors. They started the new season with an encouraging victory for an inexperienced team.\n\n\"I want a bigger sample size before I make any proclamations, but we handled it pretty well,\" Holtmann said.\n\nCincinnati is trying to build upon its 31-5 season, which included the American Athletic title. The Bearcats' season ended with the second-biggest collapse in NCAA Tournament history, blowing a 22-point lead in the final 11 minutes of a 75-73 loss to Nevada in the second round as their offense froze.\n\nThe Bearcats were prone to long scoreless streaks last season. On Wednesday, they went more than 8 minutes between field goals as Ohio State pulled ahead 14-8. The Bearcats heard a few boos at the half after going 4 of 29 from the field with six turnovers and trailing 27-18.\n\nAndre Wesson's 3-pointer completed an 11-2 spurt that pushed Ohio State's lead to 38-22. The Buckeyes also led by 16 points with 5:23 left.\n\nCumberland hit a pair of free throws, a jumper and a 3-pointer that cut it to 60-56 with 59 seconds left. The Bearcats missed their next two shots, and Jackson made a driving bank shot to end the comeback. He finished with 13 points.\n\n\"I know people don't want to hear this because you're going to ask me about offense, but Ohio State scored 27 in the first half and if we'd held them to 27 in the second half we would have won by two,\" coach Mick Cronin said. \"So we're capable of that.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nOhio State: The Buckeyes lost leaders Keita Bates-Diop and Jae'Sean Tate along with top 3-point shooter Kam Williams from last season. They need to develop scoring options beyond Jackson, but showed balance in the first game with four players in double figures.\n\nCincinnati: The front line is the Bearcats' biggest concern with Gary Clark and Kyle Washington gone. Starters Trevon Scott and Nysier Brooks combined for 15 points and 12 rebounds but had defensive breakdowns.\n\n\"I've got to do a better job with Tre and Nysier in particular,\" Cronin said. \"We're not near where we need to be on either end.\"\n\nSERIES HISTORY\n\nThe teams met twice in NCAA Tournament title games, with Cincinnati winning in 1961 and 1962. They'd met only twice since then, both times on neutral courts. Ohio State won 72-50 at the Wooden Tradition in Indianapolis in 2006, and 81-66 in an NCAA Tournament regional semifinal in Boston in 2012.\n\nLEAVING COLUMBUS\n\nThe Buckeyes are 25-1 against Ohio teams since the 1995-96 season, the only loss 60-59 to Dayton in the 2014 NCAA Tournament. The Buckeyes' last true road game against an Ohio team was an 89-86 loss at University of Dayton Arena on Dec. 16, 1986. Overall, Ohio State is 175-30 in Columbus against Ohio teams, 50-41 in road games and 8-8 at neutral sites.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOhio State hosts Fort Wayne on Sunday.\n\nCincinnati hosts North Carolina Central on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Too small, not fast enough. Kirk knows about all the pre-draft criticism of him, he says he wrote it all down and reads it every day. (AP Photo/Rick Scuteri, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTEM PE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Too small, too slow. Christian Kirk is well aware of what critics said to him going into this year's NFL draft.\n\nThey're right in front of him every day as he leaves home.\n\n\"I have a blackboard at my house that has it all written up,\" he said. \"It's all right where I leave for the door every day.\"\n\nHe hasn't forgotten that five receivers were drafted ahead of him.\n\n\"I thought I was the best and I'm out to prove that,\" Kirk said.\n\nHe is off to a good start on a not-so-good team. Halfway through the season, his 31 catches and 410 yards receiving rank second among NFL rookie wide receivers behind only Atlanta's Calvin Ridley (33 catches, 463 yards). And Kirk has done it on a team that ranks last in the NFL in offense and next-to-last in passing offense.\n\n\"This guy is the ultimate pro,\" coach Steve Wilks said. \"You look at rookies coming in really trying to find their way. This guy works hard each and every day, trying to take care of his body, trying to prep himself. I think, really, the opportunities that he has been getting, he's taking advantage of them, meaning the throws, the catches. He's finishing those plays, which is great.\"\n\nIn his previous game, a week ago Sunday, Kirk broke free in the back of the end zone and caught a 9-yard touchdown pass from fellow rookie Josh Rosen with 34 seconds to play, the winning score in an 18-15 victory over San Francisco.\n\nThe Cardinals (2-6), who play at Kansas City (8-1) on Sunday, had last weekend off.\n\n\"I went back this week and actually watched the Washington game (the season opener),\" Kirk said, \"just seeing where I was at then until now. It's night and day. So I feel like every week I'm progressing and I still want to do that throughout the season.\"\n\nKirk has lots of hometown support. He grew up in suburban Phoenix before choosing Texas A&M over Arizona State in high school.\n\nHe has developed a close relationship with Rosen, who took over as starting quarterback in Week 4.\n\n\"I love Christian,\" Rosen said after Wednesday's practice. \"We're on the same page about everything. We hang out off the field. Football's a very social game, and I think sometimes we can pick each other up and get each other going whenever we might be sputtering a little bit. Football's a game of relationships, so it's good to have a strong one.\"\n\nKirk, after a standout career at Texas A&M, was drafted by Arizona in the second round, the 47th player chosen overall. He stands 5-foot-11 and weighs 200 pounds and there were concerns about that and his speed among pro scouts.\n\nNot for the Cardinals though, Wilks said.\n\n\"Not at all,\" he said. \"It may have been a concern with other teams, but not with us. We felt like he had speed. I know that was a question: 'He's just a slot receiver.' (But) he's shown he can take the top off.\"\n\nRosen, who has his own thoughts about quarterbacks drafted ahead of him, said people sometimes look for the wrong things when evaluating a player.\n\n\"I think sometimes you just have to turn on tape and watch guys play,\" he said. \"(Kansas City's) Tyreek Hill on the other side is one of the best receivers in football right now, and he's tiny. He's unbelievable. I think they're different kinds of receivers, but just in the sense that I think a lot of guys look at the wrong things. If you turn on Christian's tape from college, he's ripping people up and down the field.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nCNN correspondent Jim Acosta is pictured before a daily press briefing at the White House. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House revoked the press badge of CNN's Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta Wednesday following a tense exchange with President Donald Trump where the president called him a \"rude, terrible person.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders announced the unexpected move Wednesday evening, explaining the decision was a result of both Acosta's behavior and him yanking back when a White House intern tried to take his microphone.\n\n\"President Trump believes in a free press and expects and welcomes tough questions of him and his Administration,\" Sanders said. \"We will, however, never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.\"\n\nThe move is just the latest in the president's escalating war against the news media, which he blamed Wednesday as one of the reasons Republicans fell short in midterm elections.

(AP) \u2014 It's become clear through the first half of this season the Seattle Seahawks offense functions best when running back Chris Carson is getting the bulk of the carries.\n\nYet it's also becoming clear that Carson may be a spectator on Sunday when the Seahawks face the Los Angeles Rams as he deals with a hip injury that could keep him sidelined for the second time this season.\n\nSeattle coach Pete Carroll said Wednesday that Carson would not practice and his status for Sunday's NFC West matchup was uncertain. Carson started last Sunday's 25-17 loss to the Chargers and averaged 5.0 yards per carry, but did not play the final 2\u00bd quarters after a lingering hip issue flared up.\n\nWhile there is a chance Carson could be ready by Sunday, the Seahawks (4-4) also turn around and play a Thursday night game against Green Bay next week. And playing Carson on Sunday may make him unavailable against the Packers, which could end up being a more important game for Seattle's playoff hopes.\n\n\"The soft tissue thing is kind of hanging with him a little bit,\" Carroll said of Carson. \"This hip thing is still kind of there and we've got to wait and see how it comes out at the end of the week.\"\n\nCarson has shown he's the best option as Seattle's primary running back when he is healthy. In the four games Carson has carried the ball at least 14 times this season, he's averaging 4.2 yards per carry, 95.5 yards per game and the Seahawks are 3-1 in those four games.\n\nIn the three games where Carson has carried the ball fewer than 14 times either because of injury or game plan, the Seahawks are winless.\n\nIf Carson can't play against the Rams, Mike Davis would likely get the bulk of the work at running back with a bigger role for rookie first-round pick Rashaad Penny as well.\n\n\"We've got plenty of guys we can go to,\" Carroll said. \"We don't have to just rely on one guy right now.\"\n\nDavis has shown an ability to be the primary ball carrier for the Seahawks, running for 101 yards on 21 carries in Seattle's Week 4 victory over Arizona when Carson was out because of an unrelated groin injury. Davis had 62 yards on 15 carries last week carrying the bulk of the running after Carson was unable to continue.\n\n\"It's like I do every week, prepare that I'm going to be the starter so if it does come up I don't get blindsided,\" Davis said.\n\nDavis has proven he can handle the load. The same can't be said of Penny, who has just 42 carries for 146 yards through eight games. In the first couple of weeks, Seattle made it a priority to force Penny into the game and get him some action. After they realized that wasn't working, Penny disappeared for a couple of weeks before slowly being reintegrated to the offense.\n\nLast week Penny had just four carries, but may see that number increase significantly if Carson can't play.\n\n\"We've just got to get him out there. He just needs more turns,\" Carroll said of Penny. \"Mike has been very versatile in the throwing game and all the styles of runs, really good at it and very effective. We're just going with what looks right. It has nothing to do with where you got picked or where you came from for the opportunities to present itself for the guys to show what they can do.\"\n\nWhoever is carrying the ball, the Seahawks will want to replicate the success they had from the first meeting with the Rams. Seattle rushed for a season-high 190 yards in the 33-31 loss, the most allowed by Los Angeles this season. But Carson was a big part of that success, running for 116 yards.\n\nDavis expects the Rams to make changes, but also believes in his offensive line.\n\n\"We know what our guys can do up front and they're killing it. I have no doubt,\" Davis said.\n\nNOTES: G D.J. Fluker didn't finish last week's game with a calf injury and sat out practice on Wednesday. Carroll said Fluker was a little more sore on Wednesday than he was earlier in the week. ... S Bradley McDougald also didn't practice with a knee injury that kept him out the second half against the Chargers. Delano Hill would start if McDougald can't play.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Bob Leverone, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Randall Cobb is out of detailed answers for now.\n\nBut the veteran receiver did have one simple solution to get the Green Bay Packers out of their first-half funk.\n\nNo rallying cries. No inspirational slogans, like the \"Run the Table\" phrase from Rodgers that turned into catchword of the Packers' comeback from a 4-6 start in 2016.\n\n\"Yeah, win a game. Win a game you get going,\" Cobb said after practice on Wednesday when asked if there were lessons to draw from two years ago.\n\n\"We've just got to win one right now,\" the veteran said.\n\nThe Packers aren't quite yet in such dire straits as in 2016. But at 3-4-1, Green Bay has little margin for error if they want to avoid a second straight season without the playoffs.\n\nThird place in the NFC North behind the division-leading Bears (5-3) and second-place Vikings (5-3-1) isn't going to cut it. A bounce-back second half can start Sunday when the Miami Dolphins visit Lambeau Field.\n\n\"It's always good to be at home. You have to take care of your home-field advantage,\" coach Mike McCarthy said. \"We also know what's coming after it, too.\"\n\nIt's a quick turnaround back on the road after the Dolphins game with a Thursday night trip to Seattle.\n\n\"It's great to be home and I can't remember the last time, it's been a while since we played there,\" McCarthy added.\n\nThat would be in Week 6 on Oct. 15 over the San Francisco 49ers, a closer-than-expected, 33-30 victory that required the Packers to score 10 points over the final 1:55.\n\nFollowing a bye, the Packers had trouble closing out road games the next two weeks, albeit in losses to two of the league's best teams in the Rams and Patriots.\n\nLast week, running back Aaron Jones' fumble on the first play of the fourth quarter in New England territory was a turning point. The Patriots went on to sandwich two touchdown drives around a three-and-out for Green Bay.\n\n\"We've lost games before here. But this just feels different,\" Cobb said. \"And it doesn't feel good. It's not fun. But we've got to figure something out.\"\n\nAsked how this felt different, Cobb didn't have any specifics.\n\n\"I wish I could. If I could then I would try to correct that 'how,'\" he added. \"At this point, we're not where we should be and where we want to be. We've got to figure out how to get there.\"\n\nAt least quarterback Aaron Rodgers seems to be getting better each week from the left knee injury suffered in the season opener against Chicago.\n\nHe seems to be moving around much better. Last week against New England, he didn't have to wear a sleeve or brace on the knee.\n\n\"Just grit,\" Rodgers said. He was a full participant in a practice on Wednesday that was abbreviated by McCarthy in part because of the wear following two straight long road trips.\n\nRodgers has had a dip in his completion rate this year, at 60.6 percent through eight games, down from his career average of 64.8 percent. Rodgers said it had to do with \"an unnatural amount of throwaways this year,\" referring to passes thrown out of bounds or out of the defense's reach if he can't find an open receiver.\n\n\"We've got to keep finding ways to get guys into one or two spots, open on time,\" Rodgers said, \"and when they're open, I've got to make the throws.\"\n\nThe Packers lost 29-27 against the then-unbeaten Rams a couple of weeks ago. In that game, Ty Montgomery, who has since been traded , fumbled a late kickoff after being directed to stay in the end zone for a touchback. The turnover deprived Rodgers a chance to drive for a game-winning score.\n\nLosing hasn't been fun.\n\n\"I don't think anybody's happy about the position we're in. So, yeah, I just want to have fun again,\" Cobb said with a smile and slight chuckle.\n\nNOTES: WR Trevor Davis, who has been on injured reserve since the start of the season with a hamstring injury, has returned to practice.

(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nA Texas judge who lost re-election released almost all the juvenile defendants that appeared before him Wednesday, a move that drew criticism from local prosecutors.\n\nJudge Glenn Devlin, a juvenile court judge in Harris County, Texas, simply asked his defendants whether they planned to kill anyone before approving their release, the Houston Chronicle reported.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many defendants were released, but the Chronicle reported at least seven. Their charges ranged from misdemeanors to violent crimes.\n\n\"'If I release you, will you go out and murder anybody?' And so, if the juvenile said 'No,' they were released,\" public defender Steve Halpert told KTRK-TV about the hearing. \"Judge Devlin would never normally ask that question of a juvenile. This was unusual.\"\n\nHalpert was requesting release for his client, according to the TV station.\n\nThe Chronicle reported that the youth's cases would be heard again, once Natalia Oakes, the Democrat who defeated Devlin on Tuesday, takes the bench in January.\n\nIn a statement, District Attorney Kim Ogg slammed the decision saying it \"could endanger the public.\"\n\n\"We oppose the wholesale release of violent offenders at any age,\" Ogg added.\n\nDevlin didn't comment to either the Chronicle or KTRK-TV.\n\nAll three juvenile judges in the county lost to Democrats on Tuesday, according to the Chronicle.

(AP) \u2014 Months before the start of spring training, the New York Yankees' injury list is lengthening.\n\nCatcher Gary Sanchez had surgery on his left shoulder Thursday, which could slow him during spring training but is not likely to keep him out of the lineup on opening day.\n\n\"His shoulder has bothered him off and on since '17,\" Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said Wednesday. \"He's been treated conservatively with it. He had an injection towards the end of '17. He had two in '18. He just resumed workouts and still felt a little bit lingering from it.\"\n\nCashman made the announcement at the general managers' meetings, hours after the Yankees finalized an $8 million, one-year contract with CC Sabathia. The 38-year-old left-hander said 2019 will be his final season.\n\nNew York announced last month that Didi Gregorius will miss much of next season after Tommy John surgery to repair a torn ligament in the shortstop's right elbow.\n\nAn All-Star in 2017 who slumped badly this year, Sanchez felt continued shoulder pain while working out last week at the Yankees' minor league complex in Tampa, Florida, with strength and conditioning coach Matt Krause.\n\n\"He said things are going well, but my shoulder is still cranky. It's still lingering in there,\" Cashman said. \"So it's just enough complaints, too many over the course of a year-and-half now.\"\n\nHead team physician Dr. Christopher Ahmad performed a debridement at New York-Presbyterian Hospital to remove loose debris from Sanchez's non-throwing shoulder. The recovery is expected to be about three months.\n\nSanchez, 25, hit .299 with 20 homers and 42 RBIs two years ago, when he impressed during a call-up in the season's final two months, and he was an All-Star in 2017 who hit .278 with 33 homers and 90 RBIs in 122 games. But he slumped to a .186 with 18 homers and 53 RBIs in 89 games this year, when he was limited by a groin injury, and his defense was poor for the second straight year.\n\n\"It may very well have been something that affected him performance-wise. I can't rule that out,\" Cashman said.\n\nSabathia went 9-7 with a 3.65 ERA in 29 starts this year. He met with Cashman in the Yankees clubhouse the day after New York's season ended.\n\n\"He said, 'Cash I want to play again. I will play somewhere else if I have to.

The president went after some of the lawmakers who had lost and said they were unsuccessful because they didn\u2019t embrace him.\n\n\"Mia Love gave me no love and she lost, too bad,\u201d Trump said, speaking of the incumbent representative from Utah.\n\nDemocrats wrested the House from Republican control Tuesday gaining at least the 23 seats needed to flip the chamber. Some additional races were still too close to call as of Wednesday afternoon. The purge hit suburban Republicans particularly hard, knocking off centrists across the country from the suburbs of Virginia to Utah to California.\n\n\u201cRepublicans shed a lot of dead weight last night,\u201d David Bozell president of ForAmerica, a conservative advocacy organization said.\n\nBut some some conservatives who embraced Trump lost, including Reps. Dave Brat of Virginia, Rod Blum of Iowa and Claudia Tenney of New York.\n\nBecause more-conservative members tend to be from safe Republican districts, most who ran for re-election will return to Congress next year. The GOP conference, though smaller, will be less centrist.\n\nConservatives say that means it is time for a new direction for their leadership. They\u2019re calling on Republicans to elect Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a co-founder of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, as minority leader. Jordan announced he was running for the post Tuesday morning. It is not clear that Jordan, who has angered many members of his own party, has the votes to win. He faces off against current House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who also announced Wednesday he would be running for the job. Retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has endorsed McCarthy.\n\nFormer Republican Congressman Phil English, who represented Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2009, told USA TODAY that installing arch-conservatives into positions of leadership is not a winning plan for his party.\n\nEnglish said Republicans should instead focus on \u201cbetter outreach to suburbanites, to women, to swing voters.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think the Freedom Caucus approach has in any way been ratified by this election,\" English said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/07/midterm-results-conservatives-join-trump-blaming-house-moderates/1922747002/", "", "MIAMI (AP) \u2014 The NFL has fined the Miami Dolphins $30,000 and coach Adam Gase $15,000 for an injury report violation a month ago involving quarterback Ryan Tannehill.\n\nThe Dolphins listed Tannehill as participating fully in practice on the Thursday before the Week 6 game against Chicago.

(AP) \u2014 After taking a career-high seven sacks behind a decimated Oakland Raiders offensive line, Derek Carr got a phone call from someone who knows just what that's like to being repeatedly hit by bruising NFL defensive linemen.\n\nBig brother David, who was sacked an NFL-record 76 times in 2002, offered some words of consolation.\n\n\"It's not that bad,\" Derek Carr said Wednesday. \"It's not that bad, my guys are awesome. The thing about him is there were times where they would have the right guys blocked, they just physically couldn't do it. At least our guys fight, we have that going for us. He did mess with me a little bit, but no, it's not like, 'Oh man, how do you deal with this or that?' It's not like that at all.\"\n\nThe situation in Oakland definitely isn't on the level it was for the expansion Houston Texans, but it's been a major drop-off from the solid protection Carr earned for most of his first four seasons.\n\nCarr has already been sacked 24 times halfway through the season for the Raiders (1-7), a mark he has topped only once in an entire season in his first four seasons. His sack rate has doubled from 3.9 percent of pass plays his first four years \u2014 lowest in the NFL among players with more than 25 starts during that span \u2014 to 7.8 percent this year and he's facing pressure at a much higher rate than he has in the past.\n\n\"It's hard, there's sometimes it's gotten that way and it's not a knock on those guys,\" Carr said. \"They're trying their tail off. We have some young guys trying to play, we have our veteran guys who dominate and they're great players, but we have some young guys that are just getting their feet wet against the best players in the world.\n\n\"It's not easy for them. For me, I've always been one, I try to make it seven-on-seven as much as you can. There's never a time where you're ever looking down, you just try and feel things, move and make throws. You try and do it and as it's happening you don't notice it until you turn the film on like, 'Oh, we can maybe adjust this or adjust that' kind of a thing.\"\n\nInjuries on the line have played a big role with right tackle Donald Penn being placed on injured reserve following a Week 4 win against Cleveland. Rookie Brendan Parker has struggled since replacing Penn and had to be pulled for part of the game last week against the 49ers.\n\nRookie left tackle Kolton Miller also hurt his knee in that game against the Browns and has been in and out of the lineup. He has been hampered even when he has played and came out against the 49ers because the injury got too bad. The Raiders averaged more than 11 yards a play in the first six plays against San Francisco before the offense sputtered after Miller first got hurt.\n\nThe situation at left guard also hasn't been good with Kelechi Osemele missing time with a knee injury and backup Jon Feliciano bothered by injured ribs.\n\nThe decimated line has hampered the play-calling and Carr did not complete a single pass more than 10 yards downfield in losses to Seattle and San Francisco the past three games. He was sacked 13 times combined in those games.\n\n\"No doubt it affects him,\" coach Jon Gruden said. \"It affects any quarterback. ... I'm not going to make any excuses.

USA TODAY\n\nNationals right fielder Bryce Harper is seeking a deal worth more than $300 million. (Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nCARLSBAD, Calif. -- It was the Bryce Harper show Wednesday, or as agent Scott Boras cleverly called it, \u201cHarper\u2019s Bazaar.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt has nothing to do with the fashion industry, and everything to do with a man who\u2019s about to become the richest player in baseball history, unless fellow free agent Manny Machado happens to topple him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fashionable,\u2019\u2019 Boras said. \u201cIt\u2019s historical. It\u2019s elite. Global certainly. It has inspirations that deal with great shoes and great hair, inspirations on the part of Bryce.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe free agent outfielder, touted to be more popular than the Liberty Bell, looks to be headed to Philadelphia, the city of Brotherly Love.\n\nIt appeared all along that Harper would remain in Washington, where he has spent his entire career. But that was before word leaked Tuesday that he flatly rejected a 10-year, $300 million contract in September.\n\nYou can eliminate the rest of the suitors, too.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs don\u2019t want to spend the money unless someone takes Jason Heyward or Yu Darvish off their hands.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers don\u2019t have interest.\n\nThe St. Louis Cardinals don\u2019t have bright lights.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants are changing course.\n\nIt leaves one team for Harper, which won\u2019t mind giving him at least $400 million.\n\nThe Phillies are the most desperate team to land a star, and with Machado wanting to go to the New York Yankees, and the Yankees having the greatest need for him, Philadelphia is the logical destination for Harper.\n\nHe will be standing in right field with the Phillies on March 28 at Citizens Bank Park when they open the season against the defending NL East champion Atlanta Braves.\n\nBank on it.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find an executive, scout, or rival agent who doesn\u2019t believe that Harper will eventually sign with the Phillies, maybe a month from now when he can drive from his Las Vegas home to Mandalay Bay and make the official announcement himself.\n\nThe Nationals seemed to be the favorite until two baseball officials told USA TODAY Sports that the offer made Sept. 26 had been turned down. The offer would have made Harper the highest-paid active player in baseball, second to Giancarlo Stanton\u2019s 13-year, $325 million contract signed four years ago when he was a Miami Marlin.\n\nNow, the Nationals say the offer is off the table. They gave it their best, and when there was not a single counter offer, the Nationals were prepared to walk away.\n\nYes, even if it means seeing Harper 19 times a year when they play Philadelphia.\n\nMORE MLB:\n\nOn the move? Could Harper play first base for N.Y. Yankees?\n\nFree agent predictions: Where will Harper, Manny Machado end up?\n\nTalks can still resume, of course, but the Nationals are trying to sign at least one starting pitcher and a catcher in free agency. They don\u2019t want to be left with voids if Harper departs.\n\nYet, they are making it clear they have no intention of giving Harper his preferred 13-year deal - and certainly not with an annual average salary of $40 million a year.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to go about his business,\u2019\u2019 Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said, \u201cand we\u2019re going to go about our business. That\u2019s about it.\u2019\u2019\n\nThere are no hard feelings, and certainly no ill will.\n\nBarring a sudden change of heart, they will go with an outfield of Juan Soto, Adam Eaton and Victor Robles, and use that extra money to beef up the rest of their team.\n\nHarper and Boras certainly are comfortable with walking away, too.\n\nThis is a player, Boras told nearly 100 reporters Wednesday, that can single-handedly turn around a franchise. Boras educated everyone on the 600,000 annual attendance increase since Harper\u2019s arrival, the tripling of their TV rates, and the franchise value increasing from $480 million to $2 billion.\n\nSo who wouldn\u2019t want the cash cow, Boras said, the only player who produced a 1.100 OPS (on-base plus slugging percentage) since his arrival in 2010? And the only player since Hall of Famer George Brett to accomplish the feat since the 1980s, when you discount the steroid era?\n\n\u201cYou have an iconic player,\u2019\u2019 Boras said. \u201cFor an owner to know the rocket ship of economic opportunity is just blasting off because the player is just entering the prime of his career. You\u2019re really talking about a unique and rare opportunity. \u2026\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s almost a lock to be a Hall of Fame player.\u2019\u2019\n\nBoras knows that someone will pay the price he seeks, and while no one can completely count out the Cardinals or even the Giants, who were willing to assume the bulk of Stanton\u2019s contract a year ago, the Phillies are going to be the ones who pay the biggest contract in baseball history for his services.\n\nThis is the splash the Phillies want for a team that ranked just 21st in runs scored, 24th in OPS, and last in virtually every defensive metric.\n\nAnd they have the money. Just Scott Kingery and Odubel Herrera are signed past the 2020 season.\n\n\u201cSeveral years ago, the Phillies were carrying some of the highest payrolls in the game,\u2019\u2019 Phillies General Manager Matt Klentak said, \u201cand going through the rebuild, we were pretty disciplined about the contracts that we signed in order to preserve our financial flexibility down the road.\n\n\u201cNow as our team gets better, we\u2019re much more open to exploring more expensive commitments.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Phillies aren\u2019t blinking.\n\nThis is the player they want.\n\nThis is the player they\u2019re going to get.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @BNightengale", "EAGAN, Minn.

Kamara Usman vs Rafael Dos Anjos, The Ultimate Fighter Finale, Nov. 30\n\nUsman has won all eight of his UFC fights and his last 12 professional fights overall. He\u2019s made a lot of noise since his last victory, demanding a big-name fight that will allow him to get a shot at the welterweight belt. Well, he gets that against Dos Anjos, who once had the belt, and is coming off a loss to Colby Covington in a fight that was for the interim belt. There will be tons on the line for both fighters in this one.\n\n6. Curtis Blaydes vs. Francis Ngannou, UFC Fight Night, Nov. 24\n\nNgannou was being built as the UFC\u2019s next big star but then he lost to Stipe Miocic in a heavyweight title fight at UFC 220 and didn\u2019t look anything like himself in his last fight, a loss to Derrick Lewis via decision in what was one of the most boring fights of all time. He desperately needs to put on a show in this fight against Blaydes, who\u2019s coming off huge wins over Mark Hunt and Alistair Overeem, and is looking to take the next step in the heavyweight division.\n\n5. Cowboy Cerrone vs. Mike Perry, UFC Fight Night, Nov. 10\n\nThese two brawlers are the main event this weekend in Denver, which happens to be Cerrone\u2019s home town. Things got pretty personal between these two recently as they\u2019ve traded shots over the gym that Cerrone used to call home and the one that Perry has called home since training for this fight. These two will hold nothing back and should put on quite a show that might night last all that long.\n\n4. Valentina Shevchenko vs Joanna Jedrzejczyk, UFC 231, Dec. 8\n\nThis is a special matchup between two of the best women fighters on the UFC roster and they\u2019ll battle it out for the featherweight title in Toronto. Jedrzejczyk, of course, is the former strawweight champ who is moving up a weight class after losing back-to-back fights against Rose Namajunas. She faces Shevchencko, who lost a close to decision to bantamweight weight champ Amanda Nunes back at UFC 215. This could be a classic as both fighters are not afraid at all to mix it up.\n\n3. Amanda Nunes vs. Cris Cyborg, UFC 232, Dec. 29\n\nNunes, the bantamweight champ, will go up a weight class to face Cyborg, the featherweight champ, in a epic fight between the two best women fighters in the UFC. This will be a career-defining victory for whichever fighter wins. Nunes, who needed less than a minute to KO Ronda Rousey back at UFC 207, has won won seven straight fights while Cyborg has won all five of her UFC fights, including a title fight against Holly Holm. This is a big one.\n\n2. Brian Ortega vs. Max Holloway, UFC 231, Dec. 8\n\nThis one was supposed to happen back at UFC 226 in July but Holloway, the featherweight champ, had to pull out of it due to concussion-like symptoms. Ortega, who can choke anybody out in the blink of an eye, is the rising star looking to take the belt away from Holloway.

Dorsey will collaborate with ownership in hiring the Browns' ninth coach since 1999, John-Baptiste said.\n\nDorsey has significantly overhauled Cleveland's roster since he was hired last year after the Haslams dismissed head of football operations Sashi Brown. Although Dorsey has never been in charge of hiring a coach, the Haslams are turning to their top football executive to help them find a replacement for Jackson, who was brought back for a third season despite going 1-31 in his first two.\n\nJackson was the third coach fired by the Haslams since they took over the franchise in 2012. Offensive coordinator Todd Haley was also let go by Jimmy Haslam, who cited \"internal discord\" as the chief reason behind his decision.\n\nDefensive coordinator Gregg Williams is serving as Cleveland's interim coach, and could move into consideration for the full-time gig if the Browns (2-6-1) play well the rest of this season.\n\nDorsey will likely lean on his deep NFL connections to find a coach. He previously worked in Green Bay and Kansas City.\n\nWhile Dorsey is expected to make some contacts, it's unlikely he'll hire his coach until the Browns complete their season.\n\nThere are already names bouncing around as possible candidates, including Chiefs assistants Eric Bieniemy and Dave Toub and Vikings offensive coordinator John DeFilippo.\n\nOklahoma coach Lincoln Riley has been mentioned as a potential fit in Cleveland because of his background with Browns rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He's extremely talented and somebody who's obviously made a huge impact for us the last four years.\"\n\nFriedman said he and Zaidi had conversations about the Giants' job during the last week. \"I kept telling him, obviously I'm biased but I'm trying to do everything I could to support him and be a sounding board and set my bias to the side.\"\n\nThe Dodgers didn't try to lure Zaidi back, Friedman said. \"No, I mean that was the point. If this was something he wanted to pursue we were going to support him.\"\n\nThe next step for Zaidi is hiring a general manager and a farm director, something he hopes to do soon if the right candidate emerges.\n\nIt'll be a new direction for a franchise that won World Series championships in 2010, '12 and '14.\n\nZaidi's Dodgers reached the World Series the past two years without winning.\n\n\"The response was just total heartbreak, I guess. I don't know how else you say it,\" he said.\n\nZaidi will spend the coming months learning more about a franchise he's watched closely for decades. He has already exchanged text messages with some core players, and he plans to visit a few this offseason. Zaidi's first baseball game came at Candlestick Park in 1987, so this feels like coming \"full circle.\"\n\nZaidi earned his bachelor's degree in economics from MIT in 1998 and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California at Berkeley in 2011. He spent 10 years with the A's before joining Los Angeles.\n\n\"It was quite compelling the way Farhan was able to put together winning franchises throughout,\" Baer said, noting he hopes Zaidi will lead the club decades into the future.\n\nSan Francisco went 73-89 during an injury-plagued 2018 with a major league-worst 5-21 record in September, missing the playoffs for a second straight year and third time in four seasons.\n\nZaidi has no plans of tackling a turnaround on his own. Sabean will stay directly involved, and Bochy is allowed the last word when it comes to on-field moves, including the lineup and rotation.\n\n\"Anything that is under the privy of the manager, the manager has final say \u2014 period. That is not even a question for me,\" Zaidi said.\n\nZaidi and Bochy spoke briefly already and will meet in person at some point. Bochy is scheduled to attend late Hall of Famer Willie McCovey's celebration of life Thursday at the ballpark after Zaidi is already back in the San Diego area.\n\nTo Bochy and Sabean, Zaidi expressed his interest in learning from both longtime, accomplished baseball men while bringing a fresh look, saying \"I see this as a collaborative process\" with \"ideas flowing both ways.\"\n\nA message he kept coming back to Wednesday: \"Our goal is to play meaningful baseball as deep into the season and as soon as we can.\"\n\nTo do so, he will strive to make \"one good baseball move after another\" in building a winning roster.\n\n\"I think the theme that we had from a player-acquisition standpoint in particular was no move is too small to not be worth a certain level of effort and detail \u2014 waiver claims, minor league free agents, second or third players in trades,\" he said. \"There's a lot of value to be had in identifying talent in those regards.\"\n\nOh, and don't rule out an A's-Giants trade with his former Oakland boss, Billy Beane.\n\n\"I think one of those could happen,\" Zaidi said, grinning.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Bernie Wilson contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Erik Bacharach, USA TODAY NETWORK \u2013 Tennessee\n\nDallas Cowboys wide receiver Allen Hurns (17) runs into the end zone against Tennessee Titans cornerback Malcolm Butler (21) for a touchdown during the first half of an NFL football game, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, in Arlington, Texas. (Photo: Ron Jenkins, AP)\n\nThe Patriots come to Nissan Stadium this weekend, giving Titans cornerback Malcolm Butler his first crack at the team that benched him in last year's Super Bowl.\n\n\"It's just another game,\" Butler insisted Wednesday ahead of Sunday's game (noon, CBS).\n\nMaybe so. But while he can deflect questions about facing his former team all he wants, there's no way to successfully gloss over what a dismal first eight games it has been for Butler in Nashville.\n\nThe 28-year-old CB, whom the Titans signed to a five-year, $61.25 million contract with $30 million guaranteed in March, has let up seven touchdowns this season, or half the total number of touchdowns this otherwise sparkling Titans defense has allowed. That figure is the worst in the NFL for a cornerback, according to Pro Football Focus. So is the 618 passing yards he has allowed. And so is the 39 catches he has allowed (Eagles cornerback Ronald Darby has also allowed a league-worst 39 catches for a CB).\n\nButler allowed eight completions (on 11 targets) for 108 yards and both of the Cowboys' touchdowns in the Titans' 28-14 win in Dallas on Monday, according to PFF.\n\nIn Butler's own assessment, he has to \"just play my game and be more disciplined,\" he said. \"Eye control and just do the little things. It\u2019s only the little things that are affecting me. It is what it is. Got to keep playing, man.\"\n\nIn Titans coach Mike Vrabel's assessment?\n\n\"When you play man coverage, you have to look at your man. Malcolm (Butler) knows that, and we\u2019ve talked about that, and we continue to practice it, we continue to coach it and we try to show it to him,\" Vrabel said. \"When he does that, it\u2019s pretty good, it\u2019s competitive. He challenges the receivers. When you look back at the quarterback, your man has a tendency to go in another direction.\"\n\nVrabel said he is not at this time considering replacing Butler with LeShaun Sims, the No. 4 cornerback on the Titans' roster.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think he\u2019s as good as Malcolm and the way he practices and where I see him going,\" Vrabel said Tuesday. \"We\u2019ll continue to evaluate that like we do all the positions on the roster. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily the case, not right now. I think that if he had to go in, when Simsy has gone in for us, he\u2019s done some good things, and there\u2019s some things that he needs to continue to work on and practice. We like where Sims is at, and we want him to continue to develop and be a leader on our special teams, and be able to help out at corner.\"\n\nSigned with the intent of being a top corner for a secondary that already included standouts Logan Ryan and Adoree' Jackson, Butler is allowing opposing receivers to catch 72.7 percents of balls thrown his way. That figure was at 56.2 percent for his career entering the season.\n\n\"I threw that last eight weeks behind me,\" Butler said, \"and I\u2019ve got a whole \u2018nother eight weeks to try to make up for it.\"\n\nA positive outing against his former team would be a good start.\n\n\"It\u2019s just a game,\" Butler said. \"I know I used to play for New England and all of that. I\u2019m not over-hyped, I\u2019m not very pumped. It\u2019s just another game. I\u2019ve got to be ready to play no matter who I play. People are throwing the ball. Just have to be ready.\"\n\nReach Erik Bacharach at ebacharach@tennessean.com and on Twitter @ErikBacharach.", "CSKA Moscow supporters light flares during a Group G Champions League soccer match between CSKA Moscow and Roma at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018. (AP Photo/Pavel Golovkin) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGENEVA (AP) \u2014 It was Manchester's night in the Champions League as United stunned Juventus with late goals and City routed Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo's brilliant goal \u2014 a volley from a long pass that dropped into his path over his right shoulder \u2014 was set to give Juventus victory against his former club with minutes to play in Turin.\n\nMan United hit back through Juan Mata's free kick and a scrambled own-goal from a cross that bounced into the net off two defenders on the line for a 2-1 win. United boss Jose Mourinho, a former Inter Milan coach, taunted home fans after the final whistle by cupping his right hand to his ear, and was confronted by some Juve players.\n\nMan City's 6-0 win over visiting Shakhtar will be remembered most for a comical penalty kick awarded for Raheem Sterling's fall when kicking the turf in a failed attempt to shoot.\n\nTheir wins nicely set up a Manchester derby game in the Premier League on Sunday.\n\nReal Madrid, Bayern Munich and Roma also won yet no team joined Barcelona which advanced to the knockout stage on Tuesday after four rounds of group games.\n\nThree-time defending champion Madrid scored four times in the first half at Viktoria Plzen before ending a 5-0 winner for interim coach Santiago Solari.\n\nRobert Lewandowski scored both Bayern's goals in a routine 2-0 win over AEK Athens which has lost four straight.\n\nHere's a look at Wednesday's action:\n\nPERFECTION ENDED\n\nThe grace and power of Ronaldo's 65th-minute finish, connecting with a floated pass from Leonardo Bonucci, would have been a worthy way for Juventus to extend the last remaining 100 percent record.\n\nThe Italian champion struck the woodwork twice and missed chances to seal the game before United again found a resilient response that seemed to elude Mourinho's team until recent weeks.\n\nMata curled his shot over the Juve wall in the 86th, and a 90th-minute free kick from the left flank sneaked in off Bonucci and then Alex Sandro.\n\nJuve still leads Group H by two points from Man United, and it is two more points back to Valencia which beat visiting Young Boys 3-1. United can advance by beating Young Boys at home on Nov. 27.\n\nCAREFREE CITY\n\nMan City's rough week off the field is not affecting smooth progress on it.\n\nThe club has been severely criticized in the \"Football Leaks\" reports by Germany's Der Spiegel magazine. City has been portrayed in internal club documents and emails as ruthlessly run and allegedly prepared to deceive UEFA to avoid a possible Champions League ban for overspending.\n\nCity's clinical six-goal beating of Shakhtar means club officials can expect to return to UEFA headquarters in Switzerland on Dec. 17 for the Round of 16 draw.\n\nAfter David Silva's opening goal, City's second was a gift from the UEFA-appointed referee. Raheem Sterling earned a penalty after he stubbed his left foot, untouched by a defender.\n\n\"I just kicked the floor by accident,\" Sterling said. \"I didn't mean to fall over, it was an absolute shambles from my behalf.\"\n\nGabriel Jesus scored from the spot then, and again in the second half, then sealed his hat trick in stoppage time.\n\nCity moved three points ahead of Lyon in Group F after the French team wasted a two-goal lead in a 2-2 draw against Hoffenheim. The Germans were down to 10 men when Pavel Kaderabek levelled in stoppage time.\n\nMADRID MOVES ON\n\nReal Madrid and Roma both won in eastern Europe to remain level on points atop Group G.\n\nMadrid survived an early scare when Czech champion Viktoria Plzen hit the bar, but then scored four goals in a 20-minute span. Karim Benzema scored twice, and Casemiro and Gareth Bale also got goals. Toni Kroos scored in the second half for Madrid.\n\nIt's now three straight wins in all competitions for Madrid since coach Julen Lopetegui was fired and Solari took over.\n\nIn an early kickoff, Roma won 2-1 at CSKA Moscow to move five points clear of the Russian side.\n\nLorenzo Pellegrini scored the winning goal in the 59th, soon after CSKA had Iceland defender Hordur Magnusson sent off.\n\nCLASSIC GROUP\n\nThe Group E table has a 1970s feel with Bayern Munich and Ajax looking good to advance. The teams each won a hat trick of European Cup titles from 1971 to '76.\n\nBayern has a two-point lead over Ajax, which drew 1-1 at Benfica, and both could advance before they meet in Amsterdam on Dec. 12.\n\nAjax next travels to Athens to play AEK, which is one of only two teams with zero points along with Group D's Lokomotiv Moscow.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Provided by Rob Jones)\n\nWhen you picture an elite athlete\u2019s diet, you might not expect to see pork rinds, chili and bacon and eggs. But that\u2019s exactly what fueled Marine Corps veteran Rob Jones last fall to one of his most incredible achievements \u2014 running 31 marathons in 31 cities in 31 days, all on two prosthetics. After all, he needed to consume upwards of 4,000 calories per day, and those dishes made it easier.\n\nEnsuring adequate caloric intake was just one of the logistical challenges. With a support team that included his wife, Pamela Relph (a Paralympic medal-winner herself, for Great Britain), and mother, Carol Wire, Jones carefully planned his route and locations. He decided not to run officially organized races; instead he logged 26.2 miles per day in city parks and trails. He timed his travel to allow nine hours of sleep per night, adjusted his prosthetics to manage blisters, and kept his pace slow enough to reduce strain on his body.\n\nWhen he completed the last run on Nov. 11 beside the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool in Washington, D.C., he felt gratitude for the support \u2014 and for living in a country worth the effort.\n\n\u201cMy purpose was to keep fighting for veterans and to be a positive example of what I was capable of doing,\u201d he said. He and his team also raised more than $200,000 for the Coalition to Salute America\u2019s Heroes, the Semper Fi Fund and the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation.\n\nIt\u2019s just one of Jones\u2019 major accomplishments since stepping on an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan led to his two above-the-knee amputations in 2010. Within two weeks of surgery, he set a goal to compete in the 2012 Paralympic Games in London, moving to Florida to train. Not only did he make the team, he and his rowing partner, Oksana Masters, won a bronze medal in sculling in London.\n\nThe next year, he took a 181-day, 5,180-mile bike ride across the country, a journey that raised $126,000 for the Coalition to Salute America\u2019s Heroes, the Semper Fi Fund and Ride 2 Recovery, all groups that support wounded veterans.\n\nFor Jones, sports serve a critical role for injured veterans. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to find out what you do when you\u2019re challenged,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you tend to quit, you can work on persevering.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, sports programs act as an extension of rehab, noted Leif Nelson, a physical therapist and director of the VA\u2019s Office of National Veterans Sports Programs and Special Events. By training for running, cycling, rowing or other events, veterans build their cardiovascular conditioning, improve their overall health and restore strength and function to their bodies.\n\nThen there are the psychosocial advantages. Individual or team sports provide veterans with a community, and perhaps most importantly, they imbue a sense of what\u2019s still possible \u2014 even if their abilities have changed. \u201cLife is different after injury, and adaptive sports can be an effective tool in helping folks redefine who they want to be,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nWhen those same activities also give veterans the opportunity to continue serving, often by fundraising or coaching others, those psychological benefits only multiply.\n\nThe Patriot Racer\n\nChicago native and former Marine Mike Mendoza signed up for the Chicago Triathlon in 2015 at the urging of a friend and without much preparation. Despite the spontaneous decision to enter his first triathlon, he won for his age group and finished seventh overall.\n\nMendoza began to train and compete in more marathons, and in 2017, he accomplished a world-record-breaking feat: completing 24 Ironman 70.3 triathlons (consisting of a 1.2-mile swim, a 56-mile bike ride and a 13.1-mile run) in fewer than 12 months\u2019 time, while raising money for the Semper Fi Fund.\n\nGiving back brings the journey full circle for Mendoza. In 2006, a grenade thrown close to his reconnaissance mission in Fallujah, Iraq, severely damaged his internal organs. His physical wounds required extensive recovery and made travel challenging.\n\nRetired Marine Mike Mendoza signed up for the Chicago Triathlon in 2015 at the urging of a friend and in 2017, completed 24 Ironman 70.3 triathlons. (Photo: Provided by Mike Mendoza)\n\nHe underwent surgery in a Baghdad hospital and remained there for several weeks battling infections before finally getting cleared to travel to Germany and then to Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. His wife and newborn son scrambled to book travel arrangements to see him. The Semper Fi Fund stepped in with financial support.\n\nNow, through his athletic endeavors, Mendoza has raised more than $60,000 for the organization.\n\nThe sporting events served other purposes for him, too. Mendoza also needed to heal mentally as he adjusted to civilian life and coped with post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nAntidepressants and therapy \u2014 which work for many, he acknowledged \u2014 didn\u2019t click for him. Instead, he re-calibrated by pushing his body. \u201cOnce I started to do that, I felt like the chemical imbalance in my brain started leveling,\u201d he said. He\u2019d felt reserved and distrustful, but could open up when others asked about his racing.\n\nMendoza\u2019s physical limitations do pose some competitive challenges. The blast damaged his hearing, and he can\u2019t wear his hearing aids during races, so because he can\u2019t hear other cyclists approaching, sometimes he nearly crashes into them. And the shrapnel still lodged in his diaphragm sometimes causes the muscle to cramp during intense workouts or races.\n\nBut overcoming these obstacles has been worth it, he said. After all, the money he raises for other vets provides athletic prosthetics and specialized equipment, and covers race fees. \u201cThere\u2019s a new generation of younger service members that are going to need the help of us veterans,\u201d he said. \u201cI just felt like I needed to give back.\u201d\n\nThe Medal-Winning Mom\n\nEvery April 13, former U.S. Army officer Melissa Stockwell invites her friends to a party. They dance, they eat cake, and they toast to Little Leg.\n\nThat\u2019s the name Stockwell has given to the remaining portion of her left appendage, the rest of which was taken by a roadside bomb in Baghdad on April 13, 2004. \u201cWe actually celebrate the day,\u201d Stockwell said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get kind of caught up in everything that\u2019s going on, but when you take a moment or a day to step back and think about your life, we\u2019re all very lucky.\u201d\n\nLong before she enlisted, Stockwell was a young gymnast with Olympic dreams. She also possessed a strong love for her country, which compelled her to join the ROTC in college. When she graduated in 2002, she was commissioned as an officer and deployed to Iraq two years later.\n\nInjury soon changed her plans. \u201cI was 24 years old, and didn\u2019t really know what my life would be,\u201d she said. Once she learned to walk with a prosthetic, she heard about the Paralympic Games. Instantly, her dreams of competing were revived.\n\nMelissa Stockwell co-founded the Dare2tri Paratriathlon Club, which provides coaching, adaptive equipment and support to more than 300 athletes with disabilities including amputation, spinal cord injury and visual impairment.

She transitioned to triathlon, trained in all three sports, and not only made the 2016 team in Rio, but took home the bronze medal as part of an American sweep.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very athletically driven,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve found I have a passion behind sports, the way it makes me feel. It\u2019s proving to myself that I can still have these big goals, whether I have one leg or two.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s shared that sentiment through the Dare2tri Paratriathlon Club, which she co-founded in 2011.

The Tennessee Titans won 28-14.(AP Photo/Michael Ainsworth) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Titans cornerback Malcolm Butler knows why he has struggled so much that opposing quarterbacks keep picking on him.\n\n\"Just got to be more detailed and more disciplined on those little things,\" Butler said Wednesday. \"I threw that last eight weeks behind me, and I got a whole 'nother eight weeks to try to make up for it.\"\n\nButler has to do something.\n\nThe Titans have allowed the fewest touchdowns in the NFL with 14. Yet, Butler has been the weak link: He has allowed the most touchdown passes (seven) and most yards receiving (618) of any cornerback in the league, according to Pro Football Focus. The Dallas Cowboys scored both of their TDs at Butler's expense Monday night in Tennessee's 28-14 victory.\n\nButler is the cornerback that New England benched during the Super Bowl last February when the Patriots lost to Philadelphia. He then signed a five-year deal worth more than $60 million with $30 million guaranteed with the Titans in March.\n\nHe started the first five games this season. Over the past three, the Titans have started Adoree Jackson alongside Logan Ryan with Butler as the third cornerback.\n\nWith Butler on the field, Dak Prescott hit Amari Cooper for a 4-yard touchdown pass with his receiver creating space from Butler by running right before cutting back toward the left pylon. Butler appeared to look back at Prescott and left Allen Hurns wide open for a 23-yard TD pass.\n\nButler plays aggressively, which he said is hard to balance at times.\n\n\"Just got to work my way around it and just make plays and play football and do what I've been doing my whole career,\" Butler said. \"Just got to hold up.\"\n\nHis next challenge comes Sunday against his former team when Tom Brady and the Patriots (7-2) visit the Titans (4-4). The Titans have been coaching Butler on his issues, and coach Mike Vrabel said Butler needs to have his eyes on the receiver in man coverage and not Brady.\n\n\"Malcolm knows that, and we've talked about that, and we continue to practice it, we continue to coach it and we try to show it to him,\" Vrabel said. \"When he does that, it's pretty good, it's competitive. He challenges the receivers. When you look back at the quarterback, your man has a tendency to go in another direction.\"\n\nPatriots coach Bill Belichick still has not said why he benched Butler and wouldn't discuss the cornerback specifically on Wednesday when asked what Butler is doing differently. Instead, the coach talked about the Titans' defense, which leads the NFL in fewest points allowed per game.\n\n\"That's our challenge as an offense is we're playing 11 guys, we're playing their coaching staff and the schemes they put up against us,\" Belichick said. \"And, right now, they're playing better defense than anybody in the league. So, we'll see how we do.\"\n\nPatriots receiver Julian Edelman said Butler is a cornerback who's strong at playing the ball in the air. Edelman also has a lot of respect for a man he called a \"heart player,\" whose progress from being undrafted out of West Alabama to now is proof of the cornerback's hard work.\n\n\"He's gotten beat a couple of times, but that goes with the nature of his game,\" Edelman said. \"He's a real aggressive player that competes, plays the ball well through your hands. He's long, (strong) upper body. He's got that ability to make up speed with the ball in the air while looking back. A lot of corners can't do that. I got a lot of respect for Malcolm.\"\n\nNotes: The Titans held a walk-through practice Wednesday.

(Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP)\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions has been a dead man walking for months. On Wednesday, just one day after the midterm election, President Donald Trump finally put him out of his misery \u2014 while opening the way for more misery for the nation.\n\nSessions was forced out by a president who\u2019d been cyberbullying him for months and undermining him for even longer, ever since Sessions had the temerity to do the right thing in March 2017 by recusing himself from the Justice Department\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 campaign.\n\nThat led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Trump was outraged, and his attacks on Sessions, one of his earliest and staunchest supporters, only grew more shameful and derisive over time.\n\nWorse than Sessions\u2019 ouster is Trump\u2019s choice of his replacement. The president quickly named Matthew Whitaker, who has been Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, to be acting attorney general, giving him oversight of Mueller, who has already indicted or gotten guilty pleas from more than 30 people and won a conviction against former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s main qualification seems to be that he has been a critic of Mueller\u2019s inquiry. In a CNN interview last year, Whitaker spun out a scenario where Sessions might be replaced by an acting attorney general who \u201cdoesn\u2019t fire Bob Mueller\u201d but starves the investigation with budget cuts.\n\nWas that meant as a job application?\n\nWhitaker\u2019s brazen attitude, combined with Trump\u2019s view of the Justice Department as a tool to do his political bidding rather than as an independent agency bound to enforce the law without fear or favor, puts the country at a precarious moment.\n\nThe last time the nation was at a similarly frightening juncture was 1973, when President Richard Nixon tried to get his attorney general to fire the first Watergate special prosecutor. In what became known as the Saturday Night Massacre, the attorney general and his deputy left office rather than obey, and Nixon\u2019s presidency did not end well.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to Congress and the public to ensure that Sessions\u2019 firing wasn\u2019t the first step in a slow-motion Wednesday Afternoon Massacre. Mueller must be allowed to complete his investigation and issue his report without interference.\n\nAn acting head of the Justice Department \u2014 particularly a presidential ally who hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the Senate \u2014 should not be allowed to impede the inquiry.

McCoy has been as invisible on the field as he has been off it in refusing to speak to the media for the past 10 days. It's a sign of his frustrations, as McCoy has yet to score this season and combined for 23 yards rushing on 22 carries in his past two games. (AP Photo/Adrian Kraus, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 The more LeSean McCoy's production drops, the less the Buffalo Bills running back wants to talk about it.\n\n\"Don't worry about me, I'll be all right,\" McCoy said following practice Wednesday before excusing himself by saying he had to go lift weights. \"I ain't ducking you, honest. I'm trying to get myself together.\"\n\nAnd off he went. McCoy returned to the locker room briefly about 45 minutes later, before exiting yet again upon seeing a large group of reporters gathered at his stall.\n\nWhatever frustrations McCoy has while enduring the worst start to a season in his 10-year career, or concerns he might have about an offense not producing at an alarmingly anemic rate, he'd prefer to keep to himself as Buffalo (2-7) prepares to play at the New York Jets (3-6) on Sunday.\n\nMcCoy hasn't formally addressed the media since acknowledging he's never been through as bad of a stretch as this in his life, following a 25-6 loss to New England on Oct. 29. After gaining 12 yards on his first carry against the Patriots, McCoy combined for just 1 more yard on his final 11 attempts of the game.\n\n\"I've had bad games, but this, the flow of the season and everything, is bad,\" he said.\n\nThings got worse Sunday, when McCoy managed 10 yards on 10 carries in a 41-9 loss to Chicago.\n\n\"He's' too talented for that,\" fullback Patrick DiMarco said. \"He's a guy that can change a game and take over a game. He knows that. We know that. Upstairs they know that. We've got to get him going.\"\n\nOne issue is he's part of a patchwork offense that's scored just 96 points, topped 300 yards net offense twice and has no continuity at quarterback . McCoy's also had off-field distractions amid allegations of abusing his son \u2014 which he's denied \u2014 stemming from a lawsuit filed by his ex-girlfriend.\n\nAnd age could be catching up to McCoy, who turned 30 in July.\n\nCoach Sean McDermott doesn't buy it and blames McCoy's struggles on the entire offense.\n\n\"There's been some opportunities to hit some holes that weren't hit, and there's been some opportunities where the seam was there, and we didn't get the movement we needed,\" McDermott said. \"It's been really a combination, but we've got to give him more opportunities to make more big plays for us.\"\n\nA year after topping 1,100 yards rushing for the sixth time, the NFL's 2013 rushing leader is barely on pace to break 500.\n\nHe's managed 267 yards rushing and has yet to score in essentially seven games this season. McCoy missed one game due to a rib injury, and was limited to playing two snaps before sustaining a concussion in a 37-5 loss at Indianapolis three weeks ago.\n\nMcCoy hasn't scored since having a touchdown rushing and receiving in a 24-17 win over Miami on Dec. 17. And he hasn't topped 100 yards since finishing with 156 on a snow-covered field in a 13-7 overtime win against Indianapolis on Dec. 10.\n\nThe recent swoon in production spans the NFL trading deadline on Oct. 30, and amid speculation McCoy might have been dealt because he has one year left on his contract, or that he was open to leaving a rebuilding team in order to play for a contender.\n\nGeneral manager Brandon Beane dismissed the narratives by saying McCoy's silence stems from mere frustration.\n\n\"I can tell you, LeSean is very happy here. He's frustrated just like I am, just like a lot of guys on our offense,\" Beane told The Associated Press. \"He's a winner. He's a competitor. And he's not happy with our whole offense. He thinks he can do better.\"\n\nAnd Beane has such confidence in McCoy, he sees no reason why the running back won't be back next season.\n\n\"We don't see a guy who's a declining player. We see a guy who's still playing well, and he's one of the better players at his position in the league,\" Beane said. \"He is working hard. He's trying to be the best he can. And he's going to continue to do that. And if he wasn't, then we probably would've moved on.\"\n\nNOTES: McDermott wasn't prepared to identify which quarterback will start against the Jets.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Chargers have proven during the first half of the season that they have plenty of weapons on offense. One who has emerged is Tyrell Williams, who has become a deep threat during the past month.\n\nGoing into Sunday's game at Oakland, the fourth-year wide receiver has four touchdowns and is averaging 28.8 yards per catch over the past three games.\n\n\"He's become a complete receiver. His receiving skills, he's just taken them to another level,\" Chargers coach Anthony Lynn said.\n\nWith Keenan Allen still drawing double teams, Williams continues to benefit from single coverage. Five of his receptions during the past three games have gone for 20 yards or more, including a 75-yarder against Tennessee on Oct. 21. He is tied for the team lead in receiving touchdowns (five), second in yardage (451) and third in receptions (22) during the first half of the season.\n\n\"I think it's really just been seeing what the defense does, when to take shots, being able to get over the top and trusting my ability to go up and get the ball or run past the defense,\" said Williams, whose 20.5 yards per reception average is third in the league.\n\nPhilip Rivers also hasn't been afraid to go to Williams on consecutive plays if the matchup is favorable. Williams caught both passes on a two-play, 89-yard drive midway through the second quarter of the Oct. 14 game at Cleveland, including a 45-yard touchdown where he got leverage over cornerback Damarious Randall.\n\nWhile Williams has made his biggest impact on downfield plays, he has also shown his improvement in other areas. Late in the first quarter of last Sunday's game at Seattle, Williams made a diving grab on a back shoulder fade for a 14-yard touchdown while being covered by Tre Flowers.\n\nWilliams said catching back shoulder passes and route running were two things that he placed added emphasis on improving this past offseason.\n\n\"My first few years, I was always just looking to get the ball down the field. I wasn't really prepared for back-shoulders,\" he said. \"It was kind of a timing thing and getting used to that, but now I've kind of figured out how to be running fast but still be prepared for that back-shoulder stuff.\"\n\nLos Angeles (6-2) has won five straight for the first time since 2014 and will face a Raiders defense that is 24th against the pass. Williams had three receptions for 66 yards in the first meeting on Oct. 14, which the Chargers won 26-10. One of the catches was for 48 yards.\n\n\"Hopefully that stays the same and they don't switch it up. It's nice to get single coverage and Keenan still being able to go for 100 like he did, to be firing on all cylinders,\" he said.\n\nNotes: Defensive end Joey Bosa did not do any team drills, meaning he's unlikely to play in his first game of the season this week. ... Lynn has left open the possibility that LB Kyzir White could return later in the season. White was placed on injured reserve Saturday due to a knee injury.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Joe Reedy at www.twitter.com/joereedy\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Mitchell Trubisky and the Chicago Bears' offense refuse to become mired in mistakes or popular assessments.\n\nTrubisky long ago ditched social media to focus his attention on operating coach Matt Nagy's new offense, and the result has been a 5-3 record and first place in the NFC North at the midpoint.\n\nWhile the Bears' defense is generally regarded as the major reason for Chicago's rise from last place, Trubisky sees the offense making stready strides forward heading into Sunday's divisional battle with the Detroit Lions.\n\n\"There's still areas I have to improve within my game and am still growing in that, but I feel comfortable and confident with where I am as a leader with command of this offense, getting in and out of the huddle, seeing things post-snap,\" Trubisky said. \"I think it's all starting to slow down, so just trying to improve all areas of my game.\"\n\nChicago's defense ranks fifth, but the Bears are fifth overall in scoring and also rank first in scoring after opposing turnovers (82 points). And while Trubisky has suffered from fits of wildness, his 96.1 passer rating is just .04 below Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford.\n\nTrubisky completed 28 of 49 for 355 yards with three touchdowns and an interception the last two games, and had several possible interceptions dropped.\n\n\"The only thing that I can think of in regards to just our offense and not his accuracy, we've played some pretty solid defenses here the last few weeks,\" Nagy said. \"I think they're underrated, especially the last two weeks with the Jets and Buffalo. Then you go back to the Patriots.\n\n\"There's some good schemes and some good players, but that's good for us, that's good for him. There were a couple balls now and then that got away from him. He'll be the first to tell you. I'll be the first to let him know that, but that's OK. We'll keep improving.\"\n\nTeammates see improvement in Trubisky within the offense in so many ways, they're getting tired of talking about it.\n\n\"This is like the 30th time I've had that quetsion,\" running back Tarik Cohen said. \"I say the same thing every time. It's just him being more demanding of us as players and just his leadership outside of what the coaches are telling him \u2014 at the line of scrimmage, making those adjustments, audibles and things of that nature.\"\n\nTrubisky insisted at the outset of training camp that he's off social media for this season, so he said he's unaware of public criticism.\n\n\"I don't really check it that often and I don't really have it on my phone,\" Trubisky said. \"So I don't hear any of the outside noise, whether it be positive or negative. I just have a lot more time, and my focus is elsewhere; within football and my family and everything else I've got going on.\"\n\nSome players spend much of their off time on social media.\n\n\"Most of it last year had been negative, so it's just a lot of negativity that I blocked out of my life,\" Trubisky said. \"I'm able to just focus on what I needed to do and who I want to be as a player and as a person. It has been a good thing for me just getting off that.\"\n\nTrubisky's accuracy has slipped at a time when he didn't have wide receiver Allen Robinson as a target due to a groin injury. But that could change this week. Robinson went through a full Wednesday practice for the first time since before missing two games after he tried to play through his injury.\n\nIt's also possible tight end Adam Shaheen could be back from a foot injury suffered in preseason.\n\nThe defense also had good injury news when linebacker Khalil Mack had his first full practice since suffering an ankle injury against Miami on Oct. 14.\n\nNow it's up to Trubisky and the offense to find a groove, even while heaviliy scrutinized.\n\n\"I think any time you are drafted as a quarterback early and high in the draft, you're always gonna be critiqued,\" Nagy said. \"But again, the only thing that he needs to worry about is what I think about him and what people in this building think about him. Everybody's entitled to their opinion and that's OK, that's fine, there's nothing wrong with that.\n\n\"But as long as he just understands that the only thing that matters is what we think, nothing will affect him.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Then they ran. Now they've won.\n\nThe massive movement that began with resistance to Donald Trump's presidency has helped drive historic gains for female candidates this election cycle, ushering more women lawmakers into the next session of Congress than ever before.\n\nAs of Wednesday, women had surpassed the current record of 107 voting members of the House and Senate, according to a USA TODAY analysis of election results. The new total \u2013 118 and counting \u2013 includes 31 first-time House members, seven more than the record set for freshmen women during the 1992 \"Year of the Woman\" election. It also includes sitting female senators who were not up for re-election.\n\nThe House will also have the largest number of freshmen women of color next Congress, with at least 11 new members elected, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.\n\n\"This is a story about women across the racial spectrum challenging the establishment and the norms and the expectations of what\u2019s possible,\" said Brenda Choresi Carter, director of the Reflective Democracy Campaign.\n\nThe surge was driven largely by Democrats, who took over control of the House. Eighty-four of the 96 women elected to the House are Democrats, including 30 of the 31 newcomers.\n\nTheir historic involvement follows the massive Women\u2019s March to resist Trump\u2019s presidency and the #MeToo Movement's protest against sexual misconduct in the workplace.\n\nFor those seeking gender parity in Congress, the lopsided partisan outcome is discouraging.\n\n\"While women made important gains this cycle, I am disheartened by the growing disparity between the representation of Republican and Democratic women in Congress,\" said Debbie Walsh, director of the Rutgers center. \"Without the full participation of women on both sides of the aisle it will be impossible to achieve gender parity in Congress.\"\n\nIn CNN exit polls, almost 80 percent of voters said it was very or somewhat important to see more women elected. That was a higher priority for women than for men, but not by much, CNN said.\n\nTwelve women \u2013 including two freshmen \u2013 have been elected to the Senate so far, and there will be at least one more when the U.S. Senate race between two women candidates is settled in Arizona. Ten of the women senators are Democrats.\n\nNine women (six Democrats and three Republicans) were elected in governors races, matching a record set in 2004, and that number could rise.\n\nWomen from both parties ran in greater numbers this cycle, but the number of Democratic female candidates still outpaced Republicans at every level, from state legislatures to governor\u2019s races to Congress. Gender parity in Congress won't be possible if the GOP doesn't field and support more candidates, Carter said.\n\nThe candidates they fielded this year \"really kind of doubled down on being the party of white men,\" and Republican women will have to hold them accountable if they want it to change, she said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters on Wednesday that the issue has \"been a frustration\" and that Republicans need to do a better job at recruiting and supporting women candidates.\n\nHe lamented having \"tried and failed the last couple of Congresses\" to persuade one Republican woman to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"We\u2019ve had plenty of women candidates. A lot of them don\u2019t win,\" he said.\n\nOn the Democratic side, the Trump effect is hard to ignore as a motivating factor for women running. While the Women\u2019s March drew millions of protesters at events nationwide on the first full day of Trump\u2019s administration, tens of thousands of women reached out to just one organization \u2013 Emily's List \u2013 to express interest in running for office since Election Day 2016. The organization, which helps elect pro-choice Democratic women, trained a record 5,000 women to run this cycle alone.\n\nBut there were other factors at play in addition to Trump's election.\n\nWomen, and particularly women of color, have been putting pressure for a while on the Democratic Party to support their candidacies. Part of the surge is a response to that, Carter said.\n\nOther women bucked the party establishment \u2013 and showed they can win anyway. Among them are Boston City Councilor Ayanna Pressley, a Democrat who is the first black woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts, and New York Democratic activist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who at 29 became the youngest woman elected to Congress.\n\nOcasio-Cortez scored the primary season\u2019s biggest upset with the defeat of Rep. Joe Crowley, the fourth-ranking House Democrat.\n\n\"We didn\u2019t launch this campaign because I thought I was special or unique or better than anyone else,\" Ocasio-Cortez said after winning on Tuesday night. \"We launched this campaign because in the absence of anyone giving a clear voice on the moral issues of our time, then it is up to us to voice them.\"\n\nHere are the winners in some of the barrier-breaking races for women:\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\nSharice Davids and Debra Haaland: Will become the first Native American congresswomen. Davids, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, is Kansas\u2019 first LGBTQ member of Congress. Haaland is a New Mexico Democrat and member of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Abby Finkenauer: Became the youngest women elected to Congress. Both are 29, although Finkenauer is more than nine months older than Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat and activist. Finkenauer, a Democrat, also became Iowa\u2019s first U.S. congresswoman.\n\nIlhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib: Will be the first Muslim women in Congress. Omar, a Democratic Minnesota state representative who was already the nation\u2019s first Somali-American legislator, also became the state\u2019s first woman of color elected to Congress. Tlaib, a former state legislator who is also a Democrat, had no Republican opponent in Michigan\u2019s 13th Congressional District, which includes parts of Detroit.\n\nJahana Hayes: Became Connecticut's first black woman \u2013 along with the state's first black Democrat \u2013 elected to Congress. Hayes is a political newcomer who was the 2016 National Teacher of the Year.\n\nAyanna Pressley: Became the first black woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts.

(AP Photo/Jim Cowsert, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEzekiel Elliott likes to give Todd Gurley credit for the NFL's running renaissance because the Los Angeles Rams star ended an unprecedented two-year drought of backs taken in the first round of the draft.\n\nWith MVP-type numbers on a team looking like a Super Bowl contender, Gurley is the best example why it's a good time to be a running back not many years after the position seemed undervalued in what is still considered a passing league.\n\n\"Definitely it's starting to re-emerge,\" said Elliott, who was the NFL rushing leader as a rookie in 2016 with the Dallas Cowboys. \"He was the first one in that draft and then as the years went on, more backs started to get picked and they've all been doing well. I wouldn't take all the credit, but I think it's just a new age of backs.\"\n\nAnd an age of young backs. Gurley went 10th overall to the Rams when they were in St. Louis, followed five picks later by Melvin Gordon to the Chargers when they were still in San Diego. Now both backs are in LA.\n\nElliott was the first of two straight rookies to win the rushing title, followed by Kansas City's Kareem Hunt last season. Among the top 10 rushers this season, eight are 25 or younger.\n\nThat's still not getting to New York Giants rookie Saquon Barkley , the No. 2 overall pick and highest back taken since Reggie Bush went second in 2006.\n\n\"I guess I kind of did start the first-round thing again,\" Gurley said. \"But those guys are great players. They put themselves in great positions to be where they are at today, and you see why they are having success in the NFL.\"\n\nElliott got a top-four thing going when the Cowboys drafted the Ohio State star fourth overall in 2016. Now there have been three straight years with a back taken at least that high: Leonard Fournette fourth out of LSU the year in 2017, then Barkley from Penn State this year.\n\nThe other top 10 running back over the past three drafts also illustrates one reason runners could be in vogue: their ability as pass catchers. Carolina took Christian McCaffrey eighth overall out of Stanford last year, even with the perception he might be a third-down back.\n\nNow McCaffrey has a respectable 111 carries for the playoff-contending Panthers while ranking fourth among running backs with 49 catches.\n\n\"A lot of times teams that had a feature back, he was considered the first- and second-down guy, and then they put in a little scatback to be the third-down receiver,\" said Buffalo general manager Brandon Beane, who had a hand in drafting McCaffrey while with Carolina. \"Well, now, you're getting these guys that can do it all.\"\n\nHunt and Barkley have made it back-to-back seasons for rookies to start their careers with six or more straight games of at least 100 scrimmage yards. Barkley's run ended there, but now he's at seven of his first eight games despite another miserable season for the Giants (1-7).\n\nHunt started his career with seven straight last year \u2014 the first rookie to do that since Kevin Jones for Detroit in 2004.\n\nNot that multipurpose lead backs are a new thing.\n\n\"I don't think anyone's ever matched how Marshall Faulk produced in the passing game, and that seems like 8 million years ago,\" Cowboys offensive coordinator Scott Linehan said of a back who was the 2000 NFL MVP in the middle of three straight years with at least 1,300 yards rushing and 800 receiving.\n\nOh, and Faulk was the second overall pick in 1994.\n\n\"I just think of these guys have been doing this stuff in this league for years,\" Linehan said. \"I think people probably targeted them because they're the best with the ball in their hands.\"\n\nGurley is well on his way to his first rushing title with 868 yards; leads the NFL with 16 touchdowns, including 12 rushing; and has a chance Sunday against Seattle to become just the fourth player with at least one TD in each of the first 10 games. The others are all Hall of Famers.\n\nThe former Georgia standout has a 162-yard lead over James Conner, the replacement for Le'Veon Bell in Pittsburgh when Bell decided to stay away from the Steelers rather than play under the franchise tag.\n\nConner's emergence also shows the depth of the 2017 class \u2014 even with Fournette missing all but two games with a hamstring injury after rushing for 1,040 yards and nine touchdowns as a rookie for a team that reached the AFC championship game.\n\nThe second-year group has two of the NFL's top three rushers in Conner and Hunt, who have almost 1,400 yards and 16 rushing touchdowns between them, while Hunt has another six receiving TDs.\n\nThe versatility of 2017 Offensive Rookie of the Year Alvin Kamara helps quarterback Drew Brees in one of the NFL's best offenses in New Orleans. Dalvin Cook (Minnesota) and Joe Mixon (Cincinnati) are expected to play leading roles in their respective run games.\n\nAnd forget for a moment about the draft. Another second-year player, Matt Breida in San Francisco, is ninth in the NFL with 531 yards rushing after going undrafted. Denver rookie Phillip Lindsay is sixth at 591 after not getting selected.\n\n\"A lot of times there's a lot of backs in the draft,\" Washington coach Jay Gruden said. \"You might be able to get one that's close in the second round, but you won't get that left tackle who's a star in the second round or that defensive lineman or that outside 'backer or that corner.\"\n\nThere's a different kind of renaissance with the Redskins: an \"old\" guy leading the way. Adrian Peterson, the 33-year-old three-time league rushing champ, has helped Washington to the NFC East lead by ranking fifth with 604 yards.\n\n\"I don't think that position's ever been devalued,\" Gruden said. \"I think you look at what Zeke's done and you look at some of the other young running backs, Le'Veon Bell, and what type of impact they can have on your football team.\n\n\"We're learning that right now firsthand with Adrian Peterson. Even though we didn't draft him, obviously, but the impact these backs can have on your football as far as running game, controlling the clock and then the play-actions. It's big time.\"\n\nIt's been big at draft time recently as well.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer John Wawrow contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Democrats did gain a clear majority in the House and flipped some governorships (although fewer than they had hoped), but Republicans added more seats than expected in the Senate and scored victories in nearly all of the most high-profile races. Both sides are claiming the results as a victory.

USA TODAY\n\nOprah Winfrey and Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams during a town hall event at the Cobb Civic Center on Nov. 1, 2018 in Marietta, Georgia. (Photo: Jessica McGowan/Getty Images)\n\nTuesday's midterm elections were a mixed bag for Washington pols \u2013 Democrats won back the House while Republicans kept the Senate \u2013 but they were something of a bust for Hollywood celebrities.\n\nOprah Winfrey's support of Stacey Abrams in the Georgia gubernatorial race? Beyonce's endorsement of Beto O'Rourke in Texas? Taylor Swift backing Phil Bredesen in a Senate race in Tennessee? Close, so close ... but no cigars for their chosen candidates.\n\nEven actress Olivia Wilde's mom, journalist Leslie Cockburn, lost her race for a Virginia House seat despite her daughter's loving endorsement.\n\nMore: Olivia Wilde praises 'incredible' mom Leslie Cockburn after congressional loss in Virginia\n\nIf nothing else, the Tuesday elections prove again that the influence of celebrities in American politics is rather less than it appears given the amount of attention their endorsements and campaign appearances usually attract.\n\n\u201cCelebrities don\u2019t really have these huge, overall game-changing effects,\u201d says David Jackson, a political science professor at Bowling Green State University. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t expect them to.\u201d They might help in very close races, but their net effect is \u201calways going to be on the margins,\u201d he adds.\n\nBesides, the big-name endorsements were made in races in the deep-red South, says Mark Harvey, graduate program director at the University of St. Mary in Kansas and author of the 2017 book, \"Celebrity Influence: Politics, Persuasion, and Issue-based Advocacy.\" He says his research suggests celebrity influence is more persuasive in advocating for specific issues rather than individual political candidates.\n\nBeyonce Knowles onstage during 2018 Coachella Valley Music And Arts Festival on April 14, 2018 in Indio, Calif. (Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images)\n\n\"My hypothesis is that in a lot of these (midterm) races, you're looking at the South where there's an ingrained culture that at this moment in political history is very skeptical of coastal elites,\" Harvey says. \"One question I have is to what extent are people in this very conservative, anti-elitist culture rejecting Hollywood or entertainment people at face value?\n\n\"When you're talking about Republicans versus Democrats, you're talking about tribes, not issues, and it's hard to persuade a tribe.\"\n\nSo what does that portend for the 2020 presidential election campaign? Will celebs be even more out front about their politics, or will more of them go back to keeping their preferences to themselves? Don't count on that.\n\nPeter Levine, an associate dean at the Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts University in Massachusetts, says most political scientists start with skepticism that celebrity endorsements make a big difference \u2013 and the midterms only proved them right. There are just too many other factors in play to pin down a loss or a win on a celeb's say-so.\n\n\"Does (a celeb endorsement) hurt? I don't think you can conclude that from these results,\" Levine says. \"My big-picture read is that the midterm elections were pretty much in line with predictions. I don't see any evidence (of a celebrity negative effect); they just did not have a big positive effect.\"\n\nBut what might change about the partisan breakdown of celebrities and politics? Democrats usually get the lion's share, in quality and quantity. But Republicans have a reality TV star-turned-President Donald Trump as their main celeb, and he's proved he doesn't need (or want) anyone else in his spotlight during a campaign.\n\nDemocratic Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke at his election night watch party in El Paso, Texas, on Nov. 6, 2018. (Photo: LARRY W. SMITH/EPA-EFE)\n\n\"One thing celebrities did this election was get people out to vote \u2013 there was a huge turnout, which is good for everyone,\" says veteran Hollywood public-relations expert Howard Bragman of LaBrea Media.\n\n\"If I were the Democrats, I would use celebrities (in 2020) for grassroots-level work, knocking on doors, getting people registered, getting them to show up at polls and getting them involved in the political process. That's the greatest value they bring in my mind.\"\n\nFor the record, the only proven case of a celebrity making a difference in the outcome of an election remains Winfrey's endorsement of Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton in the 2007-08 Democratic primary campaign, which is believed to have moved about 1 million votes to Obama, according to a study of the impact of celebrity endorsements in presidential politics.\n\nBut it didn't work out that way for Democrat Stacey Abrams, who aimed to become the first African-American woman governor but fell just short (although there are still votes to be counted and there may be a runoff next month) against Republican Brian Kemp in Georgia.\n\nWinfrey not only endorsed Abrams, she showed up in Georgia to campaign for her, including knocking on doors to remind people to vote. Even if Abrams eventually concedes, it seems clear that Winfrey helped put Abrams closer to the winner's box than she would have been otherwise given the scarlet politics of Georgia and alleged efforts to suppress the votes of African-American Democrats.\n\nTaylor Swift on stage in concert at Wembley Stadium in London, on June 22, 2018. (Photo: Joel C Ryan/Invision/AP)\n\nIn Texas, Democrat Beto O'Rourke also came very close to unseating incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz after a campaign that saw the Democrat surging in polls and fundraising even in red-meat Texas. Then, at literally the very last minute, Houston-native Beyonce endorsed him on Election Day on Instagram.\n\nJust hours before polls were set to close in Texas, she donned a black-and-white baseball cap reading \"Beto for Senate\" and told her 119 million followers to vote. \"We need you. We all need each other, because when we are truly united we are unstoppable.\"\n\nOn Tuesday night, some fans blamed the superstar for O'Rourke's loss, saying it was too little, too late.\n\nAnd in Tennessee, no single endorsement made bigger waves than the one Democrat Phil Bredesen received courtesy of Nashville's Swift, who also denounced his Republican opponent, Marsha Blackburn, in her first-ever political endorsement or statement of any kind.\n\nBut Bredesen was soundly defeated \u2013 and Swift was swiftly mocked online by prominent Blackburn supporters. But that doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t move the needle.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf that side doesn\u2019t win, there\u2019s a tendency to make easy conclusions that the celebrity endorsements didn\u2019t work,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d\n\n\n\nNor does it mean that Swift (or Oprah or Beyonce) will give up now. Swift is unlikely to return to \"The Old Taylor\" \u2013 the one who wouldn't touch political matters with a 10-foot pole; instead the \"new\" Taylor could continue to make waves and wield significant influence in the years to come.\n\nOne possible Swift effect, says Amy Becker, a communication professor at Loyola University in Maryland, is her ability to inspire voter registration. If some of Swift\u2019s young fans registered to vote because of her this time, they could become more regular voters as they grow into age brackets that tend to vote reliably.\n\n\"She might have brought some other people into the political system that wouldn\u2019t have thought about voting before,\u201d Becker says.\n\nThe Oprah-endorses-Obama example is too specific to be applied more broadly, political scientists say. Paul Brewer, a communication professor at the University of Delaware, points out Winfrey wasn\u2019t trying to change people\u2019s entrenched political identities \u2013 their tribal identities so to speak.\n\nInstead, she was trying to persuade primary voters who probably already agreed with Obama on most policy matters and only needed a \"modest nudge\" to go one way or another, as Levine puts it.\n\nNot so in a general election race for the U.S. Senate. \u201cSwift (wasn't) going to make the average Republican vote for a Democrat,\u201d Brewer says. Maybe celebs can help politicians squeak out a victory in a close case, he said, but \u201cthis was not a marginal case in the end.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Senate candidate, former Gov. Phil Bredesen, leaves with his wife Andrea Conte after he lost to Rep. Marsha Blackburn in their race for the U.S. Senate, Nov. 6, 2018, in Nashville, Tenn. (Photo: Mark Zaleski/ AP)\n\nAnd even though Swift has gotten credit for encouraging scores of young people to register to vote, these same people might have registered anyway, Levine says.\n\nSo does anybody expect candidates in 2020 to tell the likes of Oprah to cool it? Not a chance. Besides, coming close, especially in the Abrams-versus-Kemp race, is itself an achievement, Harvey says.\n\n\"She's a progressive black woman candidate in Georgia in a place where people like to vote for white men who are conservative, and the fact she's gone this distance is miraculous,\" he says. \"If Oprah didn't push her over the top, it\u2019s still quite substantial that an African-American woman got this close. It's a hell of a run for a woman; they never got that far before.\"\n\nBesides, what candidate is going to say: \"Oprah, please don\u2019t campaign for me,\" jokes Harvey.\n\nAdvises Levine: \"I think candidates (in 2020) will probably be glad if Oprah shows up, but they shouldn't count on it as a strategy.\"\n\nCLOSE Republicans are telling Taylor Swift to Shake it Off after republican Representative Marsha Blackburn defeated Swift\u2019s pick for senate, former Governor Phil Bredesen.

Referee Viktor Kassai awarded a penalty despite there being no contact with a defender \u2014 much to the amazement of Shakhtar's players, some of whom even laughed at the decision \u2014 and Gabriel Jesus converted the spot kick for 2-0 and the first of his three goals on the night.\n\n\"We don't like to score a goal in that situation,\" City manager Pep Guardiola said. \"It was really clear.\"\n\nSterling showed much more poise in scoring City's third goal, by picking up the ball 40 meters out, powering through two would-be tacklers and curling a fierce shot into the top corner from the edge of the area in the 48th. It was the run and finish of a man in form, with Sterling having scored twice in the Premier League this past weekend as well.\n\nJesus made it 4-0 in the 72nd, again from the penalty spot after David Silva was tripped by Taras Stepanenko, before Riyad Mahrez and Jesus \u2014 with a goal that completed his hat trick \u2014 wrapped up the scoring. Silva had put City 1-0 ahead with a close-range finish in the 13th.\n\nCity stayed in first place in Group F, but moved three points ahead of Lyon after the French club drew 2-2 against Hoffenheim. The English champions need one more point from their last two games to be certain of a top-two finish.\n\nAfter City's latest attacking masterclass, it was the penalty decision \u2014 given by a referee who has officiated in a Champions League final and in World Cups \u2014 that will best be remembered. It led to Sterling trending worldwide on social media.\n\nIt was so obvious that Sterling tripped himself over, rather than being fouled by chasing Shakhtar defender Mykola Matvyenko, that Guardiola covered his face with his hands after the incident before wagging his finger toward his own bench , indicating the penalty should not have been awarded. Sergio Aguero, a substitute sitting just in front of Guardiola, had a smile on his face.\n\nThe official behind the goal \u2014 used in UEFA-run competitions instead of a video assistant referee \u2014 appeared to have a good view of the trip but somehow didn't spot it.\n\n\"The referees, I said a long time ago, must be helped,\" Guardiola said. \"They want to make a good performance, they don't want to make mistakes.

(Mark Mulligan/Houston Chronicle via AP, File) ORG XMIT: TXHOU702 (Photo: Mark Mulligan, AP)\n\nLast week, Dan Crenshaw was a little-known congressional candidate from Houston and a veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nToday, the former Navy SEAL with a distinctive eye patch is being lauded as a Republican rising star and a \u201cunifier\u201d to keep track of in the coming years.\n\nCrenshaw, 34, was elected to the U.S. House on Tuesday, beating out Democrat Todd Litton in the vacant Houston-area district. His victory came three days after he was mocked on \"Saturday Night Live.\" In the episode, comic Pete Davidson said Crenshaw's eye patch made him look like a \"hit man in a porno movie.\"\n\nCrenshaw lost his right eye while serving in Afghanistan six years ago. The joke drew widespread and heated criticism on behalf of the veteran.\n\nBut his victory Tuesday night, his unique backstory and his message of unification has thrust him suddenly into the national spotlight. TV interviews on CNN and Fox News followed his win, as well as praise from GOP activists across the country.\n\n\"A for-real rock star,\" Jacob Monty, a Houston attorney and GOP and Latino activist, said of the congressman-elect. \"He totally gets the importance of using rhetoric and words that appeal to Latinos. The guy, in my estimation, is Latino.\"\n\nOriginally from Houston, Crenshaw lived in Ecuador and Colombia as a youth, while his father worked in the Texas oil and gas industry. He is fluent in Spanish. He later became a Navy SEAL and served several deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2012, Crenshaw was on a mission in Afghanistan's Helmand province when a homemade land mine went off directly in front of him, killing his interpreter and destroying his right eye and nearly blinding him altogether. He medically retired from the military in 2016, after 10 years serving on SEAL teams and earning two Bronze Stars, the Purple Heart and the Navy Commendation Medal with Valor.\n\nHe's supported some of Trump's stances on immigration, such as building a border wall, but also criticized Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. On his Facebook page, Crenshaw slammed then-candidate Trump's \"insane rhetoric\" toward Muslims and \"hateful\" speech. Opponents used the 2015 post in attack ads against Crenshaw during the Republican primary in May, labeling him an \"anti-Trump liberal.\"\n\nCrenshaw still won the primary, propelling him to Tuesday's matchup.\n\nIn a July essay he wrote for National Review, Crenshaw said it was time for a \"reset in relations\" with Mexico and urged leaders to tone down the rhetoric.\n\n\u201cImmigration reform and border security here in the U.S. are necessary and urgent parts of the solution, but so is recognizing that Mexico is a partner on this issue, not an enemy,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMonty said he was impressed by Crenshaw when the candidate \u2013 in the midst of a heated congressional race \u2013 took the time to speak to a gathering of Texas Latino Republicans in September. He started out by talking about playing soccer in high school in Colombia and time spent in Latin America \u2013 all in fluent Spanish.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a news conference in the East Room at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018.

And the gulf between Republicans and Democrats got deeper.\n\nThe hotly fought midterm elections delivered control of the House to Democrats, increased the Senate majority for Republicans and gave each side some of the gubernatorial victories they wanted most. They reinforced a chasm between the two major parties that has been growing in the Age of Trump.\n\nIn day-after news conferences Wednesday, President Donald Trump and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi talked glowingly of the possibility of bipartisan cooperation on a range of issues.\n\nBut that may prove to be a distant prospect. In Tuesday's elections, divisions between the two parties were sharply drawn, based not only on ideology but also on race, gender, age, education and geography. This partisan realignment and the political exploitation of the divisions it reflects contributed to the growing unwillingness by some partisans to see the other side as warranting respect and cooperation.\n\nThe days of congressional delegations including liberal New England Republicans and conservative southern Democrats, once ameliorating forces when compromises were negotiated, are long gone.\n\nIndeed, some of the more moderate House Republicans, those most likely to work across party lines, were ousted Tuesday. At his combative White House news conference, Trump mocked them by name \u2013 Carlos Curbelo of Florida, Mike Coffman of Colorado, Mia Love of Utah, Barbara Comstock of Virginia, Peter Roskam of Illinois, Erik Paulsen of Minnesota, John Faso of New York \u2013 for failing to embrace him more closely. \"Mia Love gave me no love, and she lost,\" the president said. \"Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.\"\n\nSome of the more centrist Senate Democrats, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, also were defeated.\n\nMore: Elections 2108 US Senate, House and Governor race results\n\nRepublicans are increasingly grounded in rural areas, small towns and the exurbs, drawing their most overwhelming support from white evangelicals and voters who don't have a college education, especially men. Democrats are increasingly centered in big cities and the suburbs that surround them, drawing their strongest support from African-Americans and college-educated women.\n\nThe two parties reflect two Americas that have conflicting perspectives and priorities. That was apparent in election returns and exit polls of voters sponsored by a media consortium including ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News and NBC.\n\nHere's how voters are sorting out:\n\nBy education: White, working-class voters were once part of the Democratic coalition, and white, college-educated voters in the past tended to vote Republican. Trump has drawn whites without a college degree to the GOP and helped propel those who have a college diploma to the Democrats. In the previous midterm election, in 2014, those better-educated whites voted for Republican congressional candidates by 16 percentage points. Tuesday, they backed Democrats by 11 points, 55 to 44 percent.\n\nIn contrast, white men without a college diploma supported Republicans by 31 points, 65-34 percent.\n\nBy age: The rising generation, those 18 to 29 years old, supported Democratic congressional candidates by 12 points in 2014. That preference has become much more pronounced. This time, they backed Democrats by a yawning 35 points.\n\nBy gender: Women voted for Democratic congressional candidates by 60-39 percent. The most significant swing was among college-educated suburban women. In the 2014 midterm, they supported Republicans by 2 points. Tuesday, they backed Democrats by 23 points, 61-38 percent.\n\nBy geography: Three of the Senate Democrats that Republicans ousted were in more rural states, Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota. Democrats flipped House seats in suburbs across the country, even in some of the nation's reddest states, including areas around Charleston, South Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Oklahoma City; and Salt Lake City.\n\nCongress will return to Washington next week for a post-election session. On the table will be one of the most pressing issues \u2013 the need to fund the government or risk a partial shutdown \u2013 and one of the most controversial ones, the debate over money for Trump's signature proposal to build a wall along the southern border.\n\nThe partisan divisions are likely to be in full display, a prospect that seems to be no surprise to voters. There was bipartisan agreement on that in the exit polls: Nearly eight in 10 said Americans are becoming more politically divided.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/07/election-results-trump-partisanship-republicans-democrats-divide/1918468002/", "", "", "", "U.S. Attorney Matthew Whitaker speaks during a news conference Jan. 16, 2007, in Des Moines, Iowa.

Juan Mata leveled with a free kick four minutes from time and Alex Sandro netted an own goal in the final minute as United blew their Champions League group wide open.\n\nJuventus defender Leonardo Bonucci angrily approached Mourinho as he cupped his ear at the Bianconeri fans and the United coach was escorted off the pitch by a UEFA official and some members of his staff.\n\nIt was Juventus' first defeat in any competition this season.\n\n\"When I work for a club like Manchester United I need to forget my past as in those 90 minutes I represent Manchester United,\" Mourinho said. \"But the others (Juventus fans) didn't forget.\n\n\"And it is a great joy for me because we won against a super team, and not because they are the enemy of Inter.\"\n\nJuventus, which was the only team in the Champions League still with a perfect record, remained top of Group H but is only two points ahead of United.

USA TODAY\n\nDallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic. (Photo: Mark J. Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWith every passing night Luka Doncic looks more and more like the answer to the question: Who will be this season\u2019s NBA Rookie of the Year?\n\nYet the form of the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 19-year-old phenom also poses a conundrum of its own. Just 11 games into his career, do his superb numbers indicate a fast-track towards greatness, or are they a quirk thrown up by the scoring-heavy nature of the league?\n\nThe truth likely lies somewhere in between. Doncic is an outstanding player, no question about it, with huge upside. Over the first three weeks of his NBA career, with no prior American basketball experience, he has scored 20.2 points per game, while averaging 6.5 rebounds and 4.2 assists.\n\nIf these numbers are sustained, Doncic would be in an elite place in NBA history. Only eight other rookies have ever averaged at least 19 points, six rebounds and four assists, according to Basketball Reference.\n\nBut there is also little doubt that Doncic has a few more factors working in his favor than many of those who came before him when it comes to putting up big numbers.\n\nMORE NBA:\n\n\u201cThe game is easier to adjust to now than it was 10 years ago,\u201d the young Slovenian\u2019s teammate Dirk Nowitzki told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cIt is less physical and more free flowing, so everything is set up for him to succeed and do well.\n\n\u201cHe has confidence, he is taking big shots for us, the ball is in his hands a lot \u2014 it has been fun to watch. We haven\u2019t seen it ever really, a rookie under 20 who averages 20 and six. The game is different now and that obviously helps (European players) succeed. Back when I came in it was tougher, more physical, there was hand checking, it is a lot more open now, the rules have changed.\u201d\n\nDoncic\u2019s latest strong performance came in a 24-point outing on Wednesday, as the Mavs fell to the Utah Jazz 117-102, The night before, Doncic had 23 points as Dallas ended a six-game losing skid with a 119-100 win over the Washington Wizards.\n\n\u201cEvery game, you look at him and say, \u2018Are you sure this guy is only 19?\u2019 \u201d Wizards head coach Scott Brooks said. \u201cI don\u2019t look at him as a young player. He\u2019s a legitimate NBA player who is going to be a superstar.\u201d\n\nTime will tell how much the stats are a reflection of Doncic\u2019s excellence and how much can be attributed to the permissive nature that the NBA has towards scoring. It may become increasingly difficult to compare one era against another if the glut of scoring continues, both as a result of tactical shifts and in the extra protection given to offensive players.\n\n\u201cYou really just can\u2019t touch anyone at all or you are going to get called for a foul,\u201d LeBron James said recently. \u201cThat\u2019s just how it is now.\u201d\n\nBefore the end of the first week of November, teams had hit the 140-point barrier in regulation six times during the course of the season, compared to eight times each of the previous two years and only three total occasions between 2014 and 2016, per ESPN.\n\nShooting frenzies have erupted, most notably when Klay Thompson drained a history-making 14 3-pointers in just 27 minutes of action. And as notable as Doncic\u2019s numbers are, 28 players around the league are scoring at a heavier rate.\n\nDoncic starred for Real Madrid last season as it won both Spanish league and EuroLeague titles, before being selected third in the draft by Atlanta, then being acquired by Dallas via trade.\n\n\u201cHe is certainly capable of significant impact even early in the season, so it is no shock from our standpoint,\u201d head coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cHe is a good player who is getting better all the time and he\u2019s more worldly than most 19-year-olds because he has been playing pro ball since he was 13.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t care too much about the stats \u2014 that\u2019s not what I look at.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the numbers, it is rare for a rookie to begin so strongly and with such composure. Trae Young (No. 5 overall pick) and Deandre Ayton (No. 1) have had strong flashes in the opening weeks, but neither of those rookies have looked as consistently solid as Doncic.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a heavy scorer, in a league that\u2019s now built for scoring,\u201d Nowitzki added. \u201cYou can\u2019t just look at the stats the same way anymore, but he is passing the test.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Martin Rogers on Twitter @RogersJourno", "FILE - In this Oct. 21, 2018, file photo, Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Doug Marrone paces the sideline during the second half of an NFL football game against the Houston Texans in Jacksonville, Fla.

Morton, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The Jacksonville Jaguars used their bye week to ponder the team's precarious position.\n\nMired in a four-game losing streak and being 0-2 in the AFC South, they came to this conclusion: They must win at division rival Indianapolis (3-5) on Sunday.\n\nIt's essentially a playoff atmosphere for Jacksonville (3-5) in early November.\n\n\"This is a thousand percent a must-win,\" linebacker Myles Jack said Wednesday. \"No. 1, it's a conference game that we've got to win. And then we're on a four-game losing streak, so we can't lose another game.\"\n\nNFL teams are usually reluctant to put too much emphasis on any one game, especially in the middle of the season. But for the Jaguars, who openly talked about having Super Bowl aspirations , they understand another loss or two likely would end their dwindling playoff hopes.\n\n\"We put ourselves in this situation,\" quarterback Blake Bortles said. \"We created this small margin for error by not winning football games. We've put ourselves here. We know we still got a chance and we've got to play really well for the whole second half of the season to go where we want to go.\"\n\nThe Jags are counting on running back Leonard Fournette's return making a significant difference.\n\nFournette missed six of the last seven games with a strained right hamstring. He practiced in full for the first time in more than a month Monday and did the same Wednesday.\n\nJacksonville built its offense around Fournette and hasn't been nearly as physical or effective without him. The team signed Jamaal Charles for a week and then traded for Carlos Hyde in hopes of filling the void, but neither move paid dividends.\n\nCoach Doug Marrone said he lost faith in his offensive line in London, specifically in short-yardage situations, but has since stopped short of proclaiming Fournette the team's savior.\n\nPlayers, though, believe Fournette's return could be a turning point.\n\n\"I know everybody's fired up to have him back in the lineup,\" Bortles said. \"I know I'm excited to watch him run. I know guys are excited to block for him and kind of see him go. We got so used to him doing his thing last year and watching that and do everything off of that. Not having him has made us change some of the things we do, but to be able to have him back and healthy and ready to go is exciting.\"\n\nMarrone evaluated coaches, players and schemes during the bye week, but decided not to make any wholesale changes. He tweaked the schedule significantly, mostly so guys wouldn't feel like things were the same after the break.\n\n\"It's just kind of like the atmosphere is a little tighter,\" Jack said. \"Obviously, everybody is \u2014 I wouldn't say desperate \u2014 but we just need (a victory). It's a must-win week. As the weeks go on, it just gets worse and worse. Hopefully this is the week we change it.\"\n\nWith the sense of urgency on the rise, the Jaguars have started to unravel.\n\nThere was a locker room scuffle last month following a loss to Houston, a players-only meeting the next day and then a run-in with London police over an unsettled nightclub tab.\n\nThey have eight games left to save the season. It starts with a \"must-win game\" against the Colts, who have won two in a row.\n\n\"I don't think you can look at it as a whole eight games \u2014 'we've got to win eight games in a row or six out of the eight,'\" Bortles said. \"Obviously, playing Indy is a division game, and that's an important one.\n\n\"It's kind of like Doug talked about all week and all last week: you've got to win one to get it rolling. It's all anyone's really focused on right now.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He extended his right foot to keep the ball from goal in for what would have been the winner.\n\n\"I made a really big mistake,\" Onana said. \"I made the wrong choices, twice, which led to their goal.

In fact (with all due respect) I have never heard of him until this recent trip to Japan.

This exhibition was previously arranged as a \u201cSpecial Bout\u201d purely for entertainment purposes with no intentions of being represented as an official fight card nor televised worldwide. Once I arrived to the press conference, my team and I were completely derailed by the new direction this event was going and we should have put a stop to it immediately.

(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A former congressman was sentenced to 10 years in prison and ordered to pay $1 million in restitution for defrauding charitable donors to pay for his personal expenses, the Justice Department announced Wednesday.\n\nStephen Stockman, 61, a former U.S. representative from Texas, was convicted in April of 23 counts of mail fraud, making false statements to the Federal Election Commission, money laundering and filing a false tax return.\n\nTwo of his former aides pleaded guilty in the case. Thomas Dodd, 39, of Houston, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud in March 2017. Jason Posey, 48, of Tupelo, Mississippi, pleaded guilty in October 2017 to mail fraud, wire fraud and money laundering.\n\n\u201cFormer Rep. Stockman stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from charities, then used the money to pay personal expenses and fund his political campaigns,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski said in announcing the sentence. \u201cAs this case demonstrates, the Justice Department and our law enforcement partners will aggressively pursue corrupt public officials, including those who seek to corrupt our elections for personal gain.\u201d\n\nStockman served in Congress in 1995 and 1996, and again in 2013 and 2014.\n\nFrom May 2010 to February 2014, Stockman and his aides solicited $1.25 million in donations from charitable organizations under false pretenses, according to evidence presented at trial. The money was then laundered through a series of sham nonprofit organizations and dozens of bank accounts before it was spent on Stockman\u2019s personal and campaign expenses, according to the department.\n\nFor example, an elderly donor in Baltimore contributed $285,000 in 2010 and another $165,000 in 2011 and 2012. The initial money went to a sham charity called the Ross Center that paid Stockman\u2019s personal expenses and the later money paid for his second congressional campaign, the department said.\n\nAs soon as he rejoined the House, Stockman solicited a $350,000 charitable donation for the sham nonprofit Life Without Limits, the department said.

Bukaty, AP)\n\nWith Democrats capturing the House of Representatives and Republicans strengthening control of the Senate, experts predict gridlock will likely block major changes to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut access to health care and spiraling medical costs remain top-of-mind issues for consumers and state lawmakers, even in traditionally conservative states.\n\nVoters in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah passed ballot initiatives on Tuesday that will expand Medicaid to more than 330,000 low-income adults in those three Republican-dominated states.\n\nIn Montana, however, voters rejected an initiative that would have renewed the state's Medicaid expansion with a $2-per-pack tax on cigarettes. Without legislative action, Montana's Medicaid expansion will end in June 2019.\n\nAdvocates for Medicaid expansion say the votes in predominately Republican-controlled states show the public appeal of extending the federal-state health insurance program for low-income adults.\n\nJonathan Schleifer is executive director of the Fairness Project, a union-backed organization that helped organize the Medicaid ballot initiatives in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah. The organization is funded by SEIU United Healthcare Workers West, a union based in California.\n\n\"Americans voting to expand Medicaid in some of the reddest states in the country shows people across the political spectrum agree that everyone should be able to go to the doctor without going bankrupt,\" Schleifer said. \"Expanding access to health care isn\u2019t a blue state value or a red state value; it\u2019s an American value.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans have tried for years to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping 2010 health law that imposed insurance industry reforms and expanded coverage through federal and state health exchanges.\n\nThe health law picks up most of the tab for states that expand Medicaid eligibility to adults who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nBenjamin Isgur heads PricewaterhouseCoopers' Health Research Institute. He expects Republicans to cool attempts to repeal President Barack Obama's signature health care law. He also expects that Medicare-for-all proposals touted by liberals will gain no traction.\n\n\"Gridlock means not a lot of change over the next couple of years,\" Isgur said. \"It takes some of the big sweeping policy proposals off the table.\"\n\nIsgur said his organization's survey of 1,500 consumers found that 59 percent identified health care as a very important issue in the midterms.\n\nWhile a gridlocked Congress might not take on large-scale health reform, he said, states will exert significant influence over health policy, particularly Medicaid.\n\nJoan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University, said the election results reinforce the popularity of Medicaid program, both among Democrats and moderate Republicans.\n\n\"Last night was really a great night for Medicaid, \"Alker said. \"I think it will continue to be a winning issue with the voters.\"\n\nBeyond the ballot initiatives, Medicaid expansion was a central issue in several gubernatorial races. Voters in Kansas, Maine and Wisconsin elected Democratic governors who are likely to pursue Medicaid expansion.\n\nMaine voters approved Medicaid expansion last year, but Republican Gov. Paul LePage refused to implement the expansion. Governor-elect Janet Mills, a Democrat, said Wednesday she would work with the state's Democratic-controlled legislature to expand Medicaid.\n\nIn Kansas, Laura Kelly, a Democrat and Medicaid expansion supporter, defeated the state's conservative Secretary of State Kris Kobach for governor. In 2017, former Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback vetoed a bill approved by the Kansas legislature that would have expanded Medicaid to cover about 150,000 adults.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Democrat Tony Evers defeated GOP incumbent and Obamacare critic Scott Walker. Evers has vowed to pursue Medicaid expansion even though he likely will face opposition from legislative leaders.\n\nKansas Gov.

In Florida, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who said he would pursue expansion, lost his bid to Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis, who was skeptical of extending Medicaid coverage to able-bodied adults.\n\nGeorgia Democrat Stacey Abrams touted Medicaid expansion in her bid to become the nation's first female African-American governor. She trailed the Republican candidate Brian Kemp, Georgia's Secretary of State who opposes Medicaid expansion.\n\nAlker, of Georgetown, said that Medicaid often is an important issue for rural residents who are more likely than urban counterparts to be uninsured. She said Georgia, Florida and Texas \u2013 three states that have not yet expanded Medicaid \u2013 have among the largest numbers of low-income residents without coverage.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/07/health-care-politics-medicaid-expansion-affordable-care-act-obamacare/1916657002/", "CLOSE President Trump took to Twitter to announce the appointment of an acting Attorney General, and then fired Jeff Sessions in the following tweet.

He\u2019s not much of a downfield threat and had trouble beating press man coverage in 2017. The Saints aren\u2019t getting the alpha dog receiver we saw in Dallas for seven seasons, but Sean Payton knows that and will craft a role that will allow Bryant to thrive.\n\nExpect the Saints to deploy Bryant as a big slot receiver, similar to the role Marques Colston played in the offense over his long, productive career. Like Colston, Bryant now struggles to separate from man coverage, but that issue is somewhat mitigated by his excellent ball skills, ability to outmuscle smaller corners (he\u2019ll see a ton of those in the slot!) and having Drew Brees, the league\u2019s most accurate quarterback, putting the ball in spots that make it easier to make those contested catches.\n\nBy moving Bryant from the X-receiver position \u2013 the receiver who lines up on the line of scrimmage \u2013 the Saints will prevent teams from pressing him. And they\u2019ll also be able to send him in motion or line him up in stacks and bunch sets, which will make it even easier for Bryant to win off the line of scrimmage.\n\nThat Bryant\u2019s production fell off in 2017 was more of an indictment of the Cowboys coaching staff than it was an indictment of his ability to still produce in this league. Dallas runs one of the league\u2019s more static offenses. Jason Garrett and Scott Linehan didn\u2019t do nearly enough to aid Bryant with the tactics we\u2019ve covered here, even after it became abundantly clear that he needed that help.\n\nHe\u2019ll get that help from Payton, and it could lead to a career renaissance, not unlike the one Larry Fitzgerald enjoyed after former Cardinals coach Bruce Arians convinced him to move to the slot. After the move, Fitzgerald, who was 30 at the time, produced four seasons with at least 900 yards and six touchdowns. If Bryant, also 30, has any amount of juice left we should see a similar spike in New Orleans. Especially if Payton can get him the same mismatches he was able to scheme up for Cameron Meredith, whom Bryant will likely replace in the slot.\n\nBryant could not have landed with a better team. He\u2019s now playing with one of the league\u2019s best quarterbacks and for one its brightest minds.\n\nThe Saints are winning here, too. Bryant gives Brees another red zone target, which should take pressure off Thomas down near the end zone. They\u2019re also replacing the mediocre Meredith, who isn\u2019t much faster than Bryant, with an accomplished receiver. When the team eventually get its deep threat, Ted Ginn Jr., back, I\u2019m not sure how teams will be able to defend this offense, which has already looked unstoppable without Bryant or Ginn. We have yet to mention Alvin Kamara, Mark Ingram or the league\u2019s best offensive line, which currently resides in New Orleans.\n\nGood luck to the 31 defensive coordinators who have to figure out how to stop this offensive juggernaut.", "Houston Texans wide receiver Demaryius Thomas (87) makes a catch as Denver Broncos defensive back Tramaine Brock (22) defends during the first half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, in Denver. (AP Photo/Jack Dempsey) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) \u2014 Vance Joseph says the Broncos and former Denver wide receiver Demaryius Thomas both need to just move on from their recent breakup.\n\nThomas said in a radio interview Monday, a day after his successful homecoming in a 19-17 Texans win in Denver, that he was misled by the Broncos about the possibility of a trade, was asked to surrender snaps to the team's rookie receivers and was heartbroken over not being named a captain this year.\n\nJoseph said Wednesday he had \"great respect for D.T.,\" was \"disappointed with how he recalls the conversations going,\" and \"we've got to move on.\"\n\n\"He's got to move on. We've got to move on,\" Joseph said. \"He's no longer a Bronco and I can't spend any time worrying about that. But as far as reading that stuff, I'm disappointed it was presented that way, I really am.\"\n\nThomas aired his frustrations during an interview with former Broncos Rod Smith and Ray Crockett on Orange & Blue 760-AM in Denver, a Broncos broadcast partner.\n\nThomas said the day before he was traded, Joseph told him the trade talk wasn't true.\n\n\"I said, 'How is that not true? My agent called me today and said (general manager John) Elway wanted a fifth-round pick for me.' So, are we telling stories to each other now? I thought we were going to be men about this,\" Thomas said.\n\nIn his first comments about Thomas' criticisms, Joseph said, \"I'm disappointed with how he recalls the conversations going.\"\n\n\"It was obviously a week and a half where the rumors and gossip were flowing, and we talked about the rumors and gossip \u2014 until something happened, we all had to focus on doing our jobs and winning football games,\" Joseph said. \"From my end, that was discussed.\"\n\nThomas also complained in the interview that he wasn't named a captain this year, something he'd been three times before, and suggested there were some shenanigans in the vote counting: \"I go to a meeting room and it's like every player came to me and were like, 'How are you not a captain? We picked you.' ... It was heartbreaking.\"\n\nFree agent quarterback Case Keenum and longtime center Matt Paradis were named offensive captains this year, and Joseph said Thomas never conveyed his disappointment over his exclusion.\n\n\"No, no. And our players vote for the captains,\" Joseph said. \"They vote for the guys they see fit, who they want to lead their football team. So, I'm not sure where that came from or who discussed that with D.T. But again, I have great respect for him. The players vote for the captains. They voted for who they thought were the best guys to lead their football team. And that's it.\"\n\nThomas also said in his interview that new wide receivers coach Zach Azzanni told him he'd have to surrender playing time so the Broncos could give more snaps to rookie receivers Courtland Sutton and DaeSean Hamilton. He also said he was the only veteran receiver who was told this.\n\nThomas added, \"I don't understand that because I've never cried about getting the ball. I didn't get (upset) about nothing ... it just hurt me. I'm emotional. I'm empty. I'm empty still.\"\n\nThomas caught three passes for 61 yards in the Texans' win Sunday in Denver, where the Broncos honored their former receiver with a video tribute before the game and by putting a giant \"Thank you\" on the 10-story-high banner of Thomas outside their stadium.\n\n\"We have great respect for D.T.,\" Joseph said. \"He was a great player here and we honored him on Sunday. We didn't win the game; he won the game. I think it's a little frustration on his part, but I'm disappointed in how it came out because I don't recall it being discussed that way. And that's OK. The last point: we've got to move on.\"\n\nNotes: Paradis underwent surgery Wednesday to repair his right leg, which he broke Sunday. ...

USA TODAY\n\n'Would O'Rourke's ability to garner disproportionate amounts of news media attention bode better for him in a national race than a statewide one?'\n\nPost-campaign therapy (Photo: Jeff Koterba/Omaha (Nebraska) World Herald/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nThe midterm elections produced a split decision: Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives, and Republicans increased their hold on the Senate. Here are takes on 5 marquee races around the country:\n\n1. Is Beto the new Barack?\n\nBy Liz Wolfe\n\nIn a tight race, incumbent Ted Cruz beat challenger, and liberal news media darling, Beto O'Rourke by three percentage points last night in the Texas Senate contest.\n\nWhen the election started, O'Rourke was hardly known outside of West Texas. He had served a few terms in the House, representing El Paso, and his father was a well-connected judge in the area. But O'Rourke was by no means a household name statewide. Now, many people believe he's the new Barack Obama, angling for a presidential run in 2020 \u2014 a young, fresh-faced orator who gives people hope that politicians don't have to be slimy or sycophantic.\n\nO'Rourke has two major issues that might impede a future campaign.\n\nFirst, he failed to appeal to enough moderates and conservatives, meaning he must rely on sheer numbers of progressives alone.\n\nAs he claimed at his most recent rally a few blocks away from my house, in an ultra-progressive, gentrifying neighborhood in East Austin, \"If you're a Republican, you're in the right place.\" But he did very little to show that any component of his platform would indeed represent Republicans.\n\nTalker: Latino voters were the ones to watch on election night\n\nSign up for Today's Talker newsletter here\n\nHis unity message felt flimsy \u2014 throughout the campaign, he was relying mostly on an ultra-progressive agenda predicated on abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement and impeaching President Donald Trump, with a side of protecting abortion rights and restricting which types of guns can be purchased. Tactically speaking, that strategy doesn't work very well in Texas.\n\nO'Rourke felt like the elitist candidate, to a degree, supported by recent transplants to Texas who live in Austin or San Antonio but are afraid to venture into other parts of Texas.\n\nSecond, O\u2019Rourke's voters might not be as consistently progressive and principled as he thinks \u2014 many voters split their tickets, voting for both O'Rourke and incumbent Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. It will be interesting to tease out whether O'Rourke's relative success was partially because he's new blood and likable enough, compared to snobbish Ted Cruz, or because Texas voters are actually interested in far-left policies.\n\nIt will also be interesting to get more reliable data on who the O'Rourke voter archetype is. Are they Texas lifers, or are they transplants who are more likely to move out of state by the time the next election rolls around? Could O'Rourke appeal to both? And would O'Rourke's ability to garner disproportionate amounts of news media attention bode better for him in a national race than a statewide one?\n\nLiz Wolfe is deputy managing editor at The Federalist. You can follow her on Twitter: @lizzywol.\n\n2. Georgia's gubernatorial race\n\nRen\u00e9e Graham, The Boston Globe: \"Georgia's gubernatorial race wasn\u2019t an election. It was an attempted strong-arm robbery. That\u2019s because Brian Kemp \u2014 both the Republican candidate and, as secretary of state, the man running the elections \u2014 used every cheap, dirty, and probably illegal trick in the book to rig his tight contest against Democrat Stacey Abrams. If Abrams wins, she\u2019ll make history as this nation\u2019s first African-American woman governor. If Kemp wins, he\u2019ll make history for engineering the most blatantly racist voter suppression tactics since the vicious days of poll taxes and so-called literacy tests.\"\n\n3. Florida's gubernatorial race\n\nJohn Romano, Tampa Bay Times: \"This election was a referendum on President Donald Trump's presidency. And judging by the number of congressional seats flipped, much of the nation decided to send Trump a stern warning. Not in Florida. Ron DeSantis, your new governor, ran a campaign that was comically bereft of vision or details. And it didn\u2019t matter. He beat a more charismatic candidate. He beat a candidate who had led in most of the polls. ... He basically beat Andrew Gillum by running on the platform that Trump can do no wrong. That was the theme of his earliest ads, and that seemed to be the opinion of his supporters.\"\n\n4. Indiana's Senate race\n\nTim Swarens, The Indianapolis Star: \"How did Mike Braun win a Senate seat? Here are three reasons why Indiana\u2019s new senator-elect prevailed: He\u2019s loyal to the president: In the GOP primary, Braun competed against U.S. Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita in a spirited contest to show who would be the biggest supporter of Donald Trump\u2019s agenda. He nationalized the race: Braun and Republicans charged incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly with being more in sync with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer than with regular Hoosiers. That accusation served two purposes: It put Donnelly on the defensive and it tied him to a party that on the national level moved further to the left in this election cycle. He\u2019s a mainstream Republican: As much as Braun promoted his support of Trump, it also became clear during the campaign that he was largely a mainstream Republican, in the mold of Hoosier senators such as Dan Coats and Todd Young.\"\n\n5. Tennessee's Senate race\n\nAlex Hubbard, The Tennessean: \"U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, long the scourge not just of liberals but also of moderate conservatives, capped off her fiery run for the Senate with a resounding victory over former Gov. Phil Bredesen. ... Still, the challenge remains with Blackburn. It\u2019s always disappointing to see a candidate depend on half-truths and obfuscation to win a political race. It\u2019s time to see another side of her. Blackburn the Senator should be calm, thoughtful and interested in solving problems. She will not be (Bill) Frist or Bredesen or even (Bob) Corker and that\u2019s fine, but she can be a senator for Tennessee. The Senate is 'totally dysfunctional,' she said back in that campaign announcement, and that\u2019s true. Making it function again will be her job. Done, we hope, honestly and thoughtfully.\"\n\nTo join the conversations about topics on USA TODAY or provide feedback to this newsletter, email jrivera@usatoday.com, comment on Facebook, or use #tellusatoday on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/11/07/election-results-2018-top-5-biggest-midterm-upsets-talker/1911944002/", "None\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed the average annual concentration of PM2.5, a specific type air pollution, per cubic meter in nearly 3,000 cities around the globe to identify the world\u2019s most polluted cities.

(Photo: Charlie Neibergall, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Matthew Whitaker, a former football player in Iowa who rose there to become a federal prosecutor and chief of staff at the Justice Department, was named Wednesday as acting attorney general.\n\nPresident Donald Trump fired Whitaker's predecessor, Jeff Sessions, and immediately named Whitaker as a caretaker until he finds a permanent nominee.\n\nTrump had considered Whitaker for a variety of jobs, including the No. 2 post at Justice or as White House counsel. Whitaker had served as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff since October 2017.\n\nWhitaker issued a statement commending Sessions as a dedicated public servant for 40 years who served with integrity. Whitaker didn\u2019t address whether he would recuse himself from the Mueller investigation.\n\n\u201cI am committed to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans,\u201d Whitaker said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., urged Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, a probe Trump has called a \"witch hunt.\"\n\n\u201cI find the timing very suspect, No. 1,\" Schumer said. \"But, No. 2, our paramount view is that any attorney general, whether this one or another one, should not be able to interfere with the Mueller investigation in any way.\"\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who is likely to become head of the Judiciary Committee as Democrats gain control of the House next year, said \"it would be wholly inappropriate for Mr. Whitaker to supervise the special counsel investigation given his documented history of opposition to it.\" Nadler said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should continue to oversee Mueller.\n\n\"The American people understand that no person is above the law and have demanded accountability from their government,\" Nadler said.\n\nMore: Read Jeff Sessions' resignation letter: 'Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. President'\n\nWhitaker wrote a column for CNN in August 2017, that said Trump was right to question Mueller looking at the finances of the Trump Organization or the president\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cThe President is absolutely correct,\u201d Whitaker wrote. \u201cMueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing.\u201d\n\nWhitaker also wrote a column for USA TODAY on July 5, 2016, that said he would have indicted Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president that year, for handling classified documents as secretary of State on a private email server.\n\n\"I believe myself to have been a reasonable prosecutor, and when the facts and evidence show a criminal violation has been committed, the individuals involved should not dictate whether the case is prosecuted,\" Whitaker wrote.\n\nWhitaker ran as a Republican for U.S. Senate in Iowa in 2014, in a race ultimately won by Sen. Joni Ernst. He earlier campaigned unsuccessfully for state treasurer in 2002.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2017, Whitaker was executive director of a conservative watchdog group, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, based in Washington, D.C. He was also a legal commentator on CNN for four months in 2017 before joining the Justice Department.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2009, Whitaker served as President George W.

OK, good,\" Trump said. \"The answer is 'yes.'\"\n\n'Say hello to Shinzo'\n\nBefore a reporter from Japan could get off a trade-related question, Trump cut him off and asked: \"Where are you from, please?\"\n\n\"Japan,\" the reporter answered.\n\n\"Say hello to Shinzo,\" Trump said, referring to Japan's prime minister Shinzo Abe. \"I\u2019m sure he\u2019s happy about tariffs on his cars.\u201d\n\nAs the reporter went on with his question, Trump said he couldn't understand him.\n\nTrump said Abe is one of the people he\u2019s \u201cclosest\u201d with, \u201cbut I tell him all the time that Japan does not treat the United States fairly on trade.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThey send in millions of cars at a very low tax, they don\u2019t take our cars, and if they do they have a massive tax on the cars. And I\u2019m not blaming Japan, I\u201dm blaming the people that were in charge of the United States for allowing that to happen.\u201d\n\nOn revealing his tax returns\n\nWhen asked if he would block a potential Democratic investigation of his tax returns, Trump said that they are already under audit and that \"people wouldn\u2019t understand them.\"\n\nHe said if the audit were finished he would \"have an open mind\" to releasing the tax returns.\n\n\"But it\u2019s big, and it\u2019s complex and it\u2019s probably feet-high. It\u2019s a very complex instrument,\" Trump said of the tax audit. \"And I think that people wouldn\u2019t understand it.\"\n\n'Warlike posture'\n\nWhen asked if he could work with Democrats even if they begin investigating him, Trump fired back: \u201cNo if they do that, then it\u2019s just \u2013 all it is, is a warlike posture.\u201d He then suggested he could begin investigating Democrats. \u201cI think I know more than they know,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the future of Mueller probe\n\nAsked whether he would end Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to meddle in the 2016 presidential elections, Trump said: \u201cI could\u2019ve ended it any time I wanted. I didn\u2019t. There was no collusion. There was no anything.\u201d\n\nWhen asked again about the Russia probe later in the briefing, Trump said it was a \"disgrace\" and \"embarrassment\" for the country and suggested he could put a stop to it and \"fire everybody right now.\"\n\n\"But I don\u2019t want to stop it, because politically, I don\u2019t like stopping it,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I let it just go on,\" he said. \"They\u2019re wasting a lot of money, but I let it go on, because I don\u2019t want to do that. But you\u2019re right; I could end it right now. I could say, 'That investigation is over.'\"\n\nOn polling, voter suppression\n\nReporters shouted at the president with questions about voter suppression during the midterm elections. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll give you voter suppression,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTake a look at the CNN polls, how inaccurate they were. That\u2019s called voter suppression.\u201d\n\nOn impeachment\n\nTrump said people talking about impeachment are \u201csick\" and that he had a \"very warm conversation\" Tuesday with Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, a likely candidate for Speaker of the House, and that she didn't talk to him about impeachment.\n\n\u201cWhat do you do? Do you impeach somebody because he created the greatest economic success in the history of our country?\" Trump said. \"'Let\u2019s impeach him because the country is so successful. Let's impeach him.'\u201d\n\n'Such a hostile media'\n\n\"Sit down, please. Sit down!\" Trump snapped at reporter April Ryan who tried to interject with a question but didn\u2019t have the mic.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m not responding to you.\u201d When Ryan persisted, Trump asked her again to sit down. \u201cVery hostile.

However, a person familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press in August that football athletic trainer Wes Robinson and director of athletic training Steve Nordwall had been placed on leave following McNair's death.\n\nAthletic department spokesman Dustin Semonavick said Wednesday, \"The trainers that were previously on administrative leave are no longer employed at the university.\"\n\nRobinson and Nordwall were put on leave while the school launched an external investigation into the death of McNair, an offensive lineman who was overcome by heat and exhaustion on May 29 and died on June 13.\n\nRick Court, the head of strength and conditioning, resigned in August.\n\nSince McNair's death, the school has had several embarrassing missteps in efforts to address mistakes that were made.\n\nThe university launched independent investigations into his treatment on the scene and the culture of the football program. The report on the handling of McNair determined that he was not provided the necessary aid and that the trainers waited too long to contact emergency medical personnel.\n\nDr. Rod Walters, a former college athletic trainer and sports medicine consultant who led the investigation, said more than an hour and a half elapsed between the time McNair collapsed and the departure of the ambulance from the campus.\n\nMaryland athletic director Damon Evans acknowledged in August that the training staff failed to provide the proper treatment to McNair, a 19-year-old sophomore.

Brian Kemp will now begin his transition as governor-elect of Georgia. He will work every day to keep our state moving in the right direction.\"\n\nKemp holds a two-point lead over Abrams with all precincts reporting. Abrams' hope was to close the gap by some 15,000 votes, enough to deny Kemp an outright majority and force a head-to-head runoff on Dec. 4.\n\nAbrams campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo said Wednesday evening the campaign was working to ensure every vote was counted, even if that leads to a lawsuit.\n\n\"We know our opponent has had the secretary of state's office declare he is the winner. We are here to say we don't accept that,\" she said, adding the campaign was examining \"every option\" to ensure the race was fair.\n\nGroh-Wargo said while the secretary of state has released numbers, the campaign has asked for the proof behind the data and received silence from the office, which Kemp heads.\n\nShe called his overseeing of the election a \"conflict of interest\" and said Kemp was using his position as secretary of state as \"an arm of his campaign apparatus.\"\n\nGroh-Wargo said they were blindsided by Kemp's claim of victory when she says there are at least 25,000 provisional and mail-in ballots remain uncounted.

A Fulton County judge ordered hours extended at some polling places Tuesday to give voters who might have been affected more opportunity to cast ballots.\n\nGroh-Wargo said there has been confusion in DeKalb County over how to count provisional ballots because they haven't been tabulated in prior elections.\n\nAnd she said Hurricane Michael, which caused mail to Dougherty County to be rerouted through Tallahassee, Florida, could have delayed some absentee ballots.\n\nMore: Brian Kemp leads for Georgia governor; Stacey Abrams says she won't concede\n\nMore: Brian Kemp, criticized for overseeing Georgia election, runs into trouble casting vote\n\nMore: Election day after: Cliffhangers, the fate of Stacey Abrams and stuff we don't know yet\n\nMore: Georgia governor race in-depth voting results\n\nCraig Albert, a political scientist at Augusta University, said the chance the outstanding ballots would close the gap was slim.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s mathematically possible,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t seem probable that that\u2019s going to happen.

(AP) \u2014 Oklahoma State's Jordan Brailford has enjoyed an outstanding season, ranking among the nation's top 10 in sacks and tackles for loss this season. For the Cowboys to have any hope of upsetting No. 6 Oklahoma on Saturday, the junior defensive end needs another strong outing against elusive quarterback Kyler Murray.\n\nOklahoma State (5-4, 2-4 Big 12) leads the nation with 33 sacks. Brailford is tied for fourth with nine and ranks sixth with 15.5 tackles for loss per game.\n\nGoing against Murray, who has been sacked just nine times all season and sits sixth in the country with 2,689 passing yards, will be a major challenge for Brailford and OSU.\n\n\"He's been an exceptional pass rusher up to this point,\" said Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy of Brailford. \"He has a combination of speed and power and he has really good flexibility. Even in the NFL, the guys that are good pass rushers, they can carry a certain speed up field, but then they can dip and have flexibility to get down under those blocks.\n\n\"He's been great. He's been active, he's been a good leader and makes plays. He draws quite a bit of attention, which he should.\"\n\nOklahoma State is coming off a 35-31 loss at Baylor last week in which the Bears erased a 31-21 Cowboy lead in the final six minutes.\n\n\"It's really little things that we have to fix,\" said Brailford, who was the Big 12's defensive player of the week after OSU's 44-21 win over then-No. 17 Boise State on Sept. 15 when he had two sacks and a forced fumble. \"We recognize the things that we did wrong and I feel like there's no need to panic. I feel like that's the mood in the locker room, especially on the defensive side of the ball. We just notice the small mistakes that we made and that can make a big difference in a game of inches. We just have to correct them as they come.\"\n\nMurray's passing prowess includes 31 touchdowns against just five interceptions. He's also been an effective runner, ranking sixth in the Big 12 with 574 rushing yards, along with seven touchdowns. He took over the job from last year's Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield and Oklahoma (8-1, 5-1, No. 6 CFP) has not missed a beat, ranking second in the nation in total offense (563.2 yards per game) and third in scoring (49.1 points).\n\nGundy recognized it as a major task for his defense to try to mitigate the dual threat that Murray presents.\n\n\"He's really good,\" Gundy said. \"We all know that. The basis of defensive football is that everybody has a gap responsibility, everybody has a zone coverage or man coverage. The one player you have a hard time accounting for is the quarterback. When you are trying to defend a player that is that active, it's not always easy, which has been evident if you've watched their games this year.\"\n\nGundy acknowledged the possibility that the Cowboys might designate a specific defensive player to keep an eye on Murray at times, so he doesn't take off on runs. But that can be somewhat of a risky strategy, potentially leaving openings elsewhere.\n\n\"I'm not saying that it's not a good plan to do it, and I'm not saying people haven't tried it, I haven't seen it work very good for them,\" Gundy said. \"If you were to spy him, it would have to be someone who is very fast because he runs pretty well. There have been attempts and have been some times that it has been successful, but if you spy him, you're giving up something somewhere else.\"\n\nOklahoma State defensive tackle Enoch Smith confirmed that the Cowboys' practices this week were specially designed to try to combat Murray's specific skill set.\n\n\"It's really intense,\" Smith said. \"We are moving at a fast pace because we have to get ready for their quarterback, who is extremely agile. He will run all over the place, so we've got a lot of movement going on in practice. A lot of intensity so we can go up against their offensive line and do what we have to do.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Whitaker was Sessions' chief of staff and had been considered for a variety of jobs in the Trump administration, including the No. 2 post at Justice or as White House counsel.\n\nIn his new role, Whitaker also will oversee special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, prompting fears among Democratic lawmakers that Trump was seeking to derail the inquiry as it nears an end.\n\n\"Since the day I was honored to be sworn in as attorney general of the United States, I came to work at the Department of Justice every day determined to do my duty and serve my country,\" Sessions said in a seven-paragraph letter. \"I have done so to the best of my ability to support the fundamental legal processes that are the foundation of justice.\"\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who had been overseeing Mueller's investigation until Whitaker's appointment, was at the White House on Wednesday afternoon for a meeting, though he remained in his job. He was among those in an entourage of Justice leaders who accompanied Sessions as he exited the department for the last time Wednesday night.\n\nAn emotional Sessions clasped hands with Rosenstein and Whitaker, waved at a hastily gathered crowd in the department's courtyard, then climbed in the backseat of a black SUV with his security detail for the ride home.\n\nIn a statement later Wednesday, Whitaker called his appointment a \"true honor.\"\n\n\"I am committed to leading a fair department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans,\" Whitaker said.\n\nHe described Sessions as \"a dedicated public servant.\"\n\n\"It has been a privilege to work under his leadership,\" Whitaker said. \"He is a man of integrity who has served this nation well.\u201d\n\nMore: Who is Matthew Whitaker?

It\u2019s very sad,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Hill.TV. \u201cI\u2019m not happy at the border, I\u2019m not happy with numerous things, not just this.\u201d\n\nThe broadsides became even more pointed in recent weeks, when Trump described Sessions as \"disgraceful\" for asking the Justice Department's inspector general \u2013 not prosecutors \u2013 to review Republican allegations of surveillance abuses related to the monitoring of a former Trump campaign aide.\n\nSessions\u2019 recusal in March 2017 for failing to disclose election-year meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak \u2013 and Trump's dismissal of FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 \u2013 prompted the appointment of Mueller, a former FBI director, as the Justice Department\u2019s special counsel to direct the wide-ranging Russia inquiry.\n\nMueller\u2019s appointment and the inquiry's expansion to include a deep examination of the Trump family\u2019s finances and possible obstruction of justice stoked the president\u2019s attacks on the attorney general.\n\n\"I think you have to ask the question of who benefits from Sessions\u2019 removal,\" said Jimmy Gurule, who was an assistant attorney general under President George H.W. Bush. \"And the answer is President Trump.\"\n\nFormer Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who served under President George W. Bush, credited Sessions with \u201cmaintaining unusual equanimity and dignity under fire\u201d while dutifully carrying out Trump\u2019s agenda on a range of issues, including immigration and violent crime enforcement.\n\n\"He\u2019s done all this under enormous pressure, and we know what that is,\" Mukasey told USA TODAY, referring to unrelenting criticism from the president. \"I can\u2019t imagine how he\u2019s been able to do this.\"\n\nMukasey, a Sessions confidant whose portrait hangs in the attorney general\u2019s fifth-floor conference room, characterized the atmosphere created by Trump\u2019s public attacks as akin to a \u201cpsychodrama.\u201d\n\nRather than walk away in the face of Trump's attacks, Mukasey said, Sessions remained at the helm of the sprawling agency \"for the welfare of the department.\"\n\n\"For him to have done that is incredible,\" Mukasey said.\n\nIn July 2017, Trump told The New York Times he would never have appointed the former Alabama senator had he known Sessions would disqualify himself from overseeing the Russia investigation.\n\nHe repeated the line in a Rose Garden news conference the following week. \"If he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me prior to taking office, and I would have, quite simply, picked somebody else,\" Trump said. \"So I think that's a bad thing, not for the president but for the presidency.\"\n\nThe president called his own attorney general \"beleaguered,\" slammed him for failing to investigate former political opponent Hillary Clinton and questioned the significance of his early loyalty during the campaign.\n\nRelated:\n\nAs tensions rose in the months after his recusal decision, Sessions offered the president his resignation, but it was not accepted.\n\nSessions\u2019 actions were called into question after his contentious confirmation hearing in January 2017.\n\nDuring questioning, Sessions failed to disclose at least two meetings with Kislyak in 2016 and a third encounter that the attorney general said he did not remember.\n\nThe meetings with Kislyak, first disclosed by The Washington Post, triggered Sessions\u2019 decision to disqualify himself.\n\nSessions said he did not discuss campaign-related issues and Trump policy matters with the Russian ambassador. On July 21, the Post reported, based on U.S. intercepts of Kislyak\u2019s contacts with Moscow, that the ambassador said Sessions engaged in substantial discussions of campaign-related and policy issues.\n\nSessions has not publicly addressed the report.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, called for Sessions to testify before the committee about the contents of the report.\n\nRepublicans rallied to Sessions\u2019 side in the wake of Trump's early rebukes.\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich said the attorney general\u2019s loyalty to the president was unwavering, having stood by candidate Trump even when audio recordings emerged in October 2016 of Trump's crude recounting of his treatment of women.\n\nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Sessions was \u201ccentral\u2019\u2019 to pushing the Trump campaign\u2019s conservative agenda.\n\nCracks in that bedrock of support appeared as early as January when House Freedom Caucus leaders Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Jim Jordan of Ohio called for the attorney general to step down. The congressmen, citing Sessions' recusal from the Russia inquiry, asserted that the attorney general could no longer adequately manage the department and the FBI. Gingrich and Grassley more recently signaled that their support for Sessions was waning.\n\nThis year, another former Senate colleague and supporter, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., declared the Trump-Sessions relationship as \"beyond repair,\" fueling speculation that Graham might be in line for the job. He denied any interest in the post.\n\nThe criticism came even as Sessions aggressively pursued the staunchly conservative agenda Trump outlined on the campaign trail.\n\nHe called attention to spikes in violent crime; ordered a sweeping review of police agreements that punished troubled agencies; rolled back a series of Obama-era civil rights actions, including a Justice Department challenge to a controversial voter identification law in Texas; and threatened so-called sanctuary cities for harboring undocumented immigrants. In January, the attorney general paved the way for tougher marijuana enforcement when he rescinded the previous administration's policy of noninterference with state laws allowing the use of medical and recreational pot.\n\nSessions pushed the president\u2019s immigration enforcement policy \u2013 the centerpiece of Trump\u2019s successful campaign.\n\nAnnouncing a new set of requirements for cities to maintain eligibility for millions in federal grants, Sessions said jurisdictions would have to provide federal immigration authorities access to all detention centers to determine the status of suspected undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe crackdown drew the ire of immigration and human rights advocates but brought plaudits from his conservative colleagues.\n\n\"I have total confidence in the attorney general,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in September.\n\nRelated:\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/07/jeff-sessions-resigns-attorney-general-trump/512600001/", "bad url", "News from around our 50 States", "Cord cutting accelerates as pay TV loses 1 million customers in largest-ever quarterly loss\n\nCLOSE Cord cutting is getting complicated.

Two weeks ago, AT&T said DirecTV lost a net 297,000 subscribers during the quarter \u2013 359,600 satellite subscribers departed, while it added 49,000 new subscribers to its streaming TV service DirecTV Now. Overall, AT&T has 25.15 million pay-TV customers; Directv, 19.6 million; U-Verse, 3.7 million; and DirecTV Now, 1.86 million.\n\nLooking just at satellite TV departures, the industry lost 726,000 subscribers during the period. Telecom TV services, which includes AT&T's U-Verse and Verizon FiOS, lost 104,000 customers combined.\n\nCable TV providers lost about 293,000 for the quarter, but its trends \"are getting marginally better,\" MoffettNathanson suggests, as the industry lost 322,000 in the same period a year ago.\n\nWhile Comcast lost the most video subscribers (106,000), it also added 363,000 broadband subscribers.\n\nSlowing growth for DirecTV Now and Sling TV could suggest \"price sensitivity\" of broadband-delivered TV services may be \"turning out to be greater than expected,\" after several of the services increased prices, the analysts said.\n\nMoffettNathanson did not list firm numbers for services such as fuboTV, but said there were \"anecdotal reports of strong growth of smaller players\" that could suggest a \"shift in leadership\" in broadband-delivered services.

(AP Photo/Ron Schwane) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 There are times that Dolphins coach Adam Gase hears about a cool play that happened somewhere else in the NFL, or something unique that a rival might be doing, and he makes a note to himself to check it out once his day-to-day work is complete.\n\nThen there are times he flips on the TV for pure entertainment.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" Gase said, \"when you watch Kansas City, you sit back and watch because it just seems like they're out there playing 7-on-7. It's impressive to watch.\"\n\nPatrick Mahomes and Co. has certainly captured the attention of the league.\n\nThe Chiefs lead the NFL in scoring at more than 36 points per game. They have its reigning rushing champion in Kareem Hunt, the league's fastest wide receiver in Tyreek Hill, the most versatile tight end in Travis Kelce and plenty of depth behind all of them.\n\nThen there's Mahomes, who can break Andrew Luck's single-season NFL record with his ninth straight 300-yard passing game Sunday against Arizona. The first-year starter has thrown 29 touchdown passes, two shy of Len Dawson's 54-year-old franchise record, and he leads the league in most meaningful statistical categories: yards, TD passes, touchdown-to-interception ratio.\n\n\"He's a baller, like I've been saying,\" said Dolphins wide receiver Albert Wilson, who spent last season with the Chiefs. \"He thinks he can make every throw. He has a great group of guys around him to do good things with the football. I'm not surprised at all.\"\n\nWilson has reason to watch Kansas City, considering he has so many friends still on the roster. But it still speaks volumes that in the midst of his own preparation he finds time to tune in.\n\nThen again, it's hard for his coach to complain when Gase is doing the same thing.\n\nAlex Smith also has plenty of friends on the Chiefs, including Mahomes, who stepped into his job when Kansas City traded him to the Redskins last offseason. The veteran Smith helped to mentor the Texas Tech standout when he was a wide-eyed rookie, and he takes pride in the young quarterback's success.\n\nWhen the Chiefs rallied in the fourth quarter for a Monday night win at Denver earlier in the season, and Mahomes took on a starring role in primetime, Smith was watching from his home near Washington, D.C.\n\n\"I mean, record-setting start for them, for him, for the offense \u2014 lighting the world on fire right now,\" Smith said. \"Fun to watch, obviously a ton of friends on that team, including Pat, and to see what they are doing is crazy. They are on fire right now.\"\n\nThat game against Denver was the most-watched Monday night game that didn't involve the Cowboys since Week 16 of the 2016 season. When the Chiefs played the Patriots on Sunday night a few weeks ago, it earned a 12.3 rating and 21.1 million viewers for NBC, an increase of 31 percent from last year.\n\nIn the Kansas City market, about half the TVs are tuned into the Chiefs whenever they are playing.\n\n\"It's been a lot of fun, frankly, for me and I think everybody who is a Chiefs fan to see all the interest in the Chiefs,\" team owner Clark Hunt said.\n\n\"That's a credit to the success we've had. That interest is not only here locally but it's really nationally. It seems like everybody who went to Texas Tech is all of a sudden now a Chiefs fan, which is great.\n\n\"You mentioned the TV ratings \u2014 the ratings were among the highest in a number of years for that Patriots game on Sunday night. Our local ratings are also higher than they've been in many, many years,\" Hunt added. \"Our local ratings are always very good, but clearly Andy (Reid), Patrick and the offense and the victories that we're getting has taken that to a higher level.\"\n\nThe Chiefs will get plenty of more exposure this season, too.\n\nAfter facing the lowly Cardinals on Sunday, the Chiefs head to Mexico City to face the high-flying Los Angeles Rams on Monday night. They also have a Thursday night showdown with the surging Los Angeles Chargers and a Sunday night trip to Seattle two days before Christmas.\n\nRegardless of whether anyone tunes in, Mahomes plans to keep the party going.\n\n\"Just being able to learn every day from Coach Reid, be able to get out here with all these guys, we literally have fun every single day,\" he said. \"We love coming to work and getting to just play this game that we've loved since we were little kids and winning a lot of games.\"\n\nNotes: Safety Eric Berry (heel), LB Anthony Hitchens (ribs), C Mitch Morse (concussion), WR Sammy Watkins (foot) and OL Cam Erving (illness) did not practice Wednesday. ...

(Photo: Brad Rempel, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIt\u2019s about time. Dez Bryant has a job again and as it turns out, it was worth the wait.\n\nRemember when the X-man rebuffed the Ravens? Balked at the Browns? Mused about the 49ers and said he wanted a Cowboys reunion?\n\nWell, none of those other possibilities stacks up quite like this.\n\nBryant, 30, who agreed to a one-year deal Wednesday with the Saints, suddenly has found himself aligned with Drew Brees for his best chance to win a Super Bowl.\n\nAlong the way, the passionate Bryant can do wonders in revising a reputation that has pegged him (sometimes unfairly) as a self-absorbed player who fueled too much drama and too many headaches.\n\nSee, sometimes, you get a bit lucky.\n\nOf course, Nov. 29 is circled on the calendar because that\u2019s when Bryant can roll into Dallas with a chance to make a point in prime time.\n\nBut the real date to note is Feb. 3, when Super Bowl LIII will be played in Atlanta.\n\nMake no mistake: That\u2019s what this is about for the Saints, the hottest team in the NFL with a seven-game winning streak punctuated by their victory against the previously unbeaten Rams on Sunday.\n\nMore: Cowboys' Jason Garrett 'happy' for Dez Bryant after reports of WR's deal with Saints\n\nMore: Eagles' Jason Kelce has no love for Cowboys, says he's never liked what they stand for\n\nAdding Bryant is just one more indicator of what this season of redemption \u2013 following that deflating loss on the \u201cMinnesota Miracle\u201d in the NFC divisional round last January \u2013 has been all along for Sean Payton and Co.\n\nIt\u2019s Super Bowl-or-bust. Yes, the Rams \u2013 evidenced by the offseason makeover of the defense and recent acquisition of pass rusher Dante Fowler -- have a similar mission. And it looks like the Saints (7-1) and Rams (8-1) could be on some type of collision course for an NFC title game rematch.\n\nBryant, to complement star receiver Michael Thomas and multi-tasking back Alvin Kamara, provides another layer for the NFL\u2019s No. 2 scoring team.\n\nPut that on top of the recent trade with the Giants to land former first-round cornerback Eli Apple to bolster a spotty secondary. Add this to the preseason trade to bring in Teddy Bridgewater as Brees\u2019 backup, ensuring that if Payton finds himself in a situation similar to what Doug Pederson dealt with last year with the Eagles, he has his Nick Foles insurance policy.\n\nThe Saints made a play this week, too, to add pass rusher Bruce Irvin, who was dumped by Jon Gruden\u2019s Raiders last week and instead signed with the Falcons. Irvin would have been a good addition in light of the temporary setback of injured first-round rookie Marcus Davenport.\n\nThey lost out on Irvin \u2013 and to their dreaded division rival, at that \u2013 but the pursuit still illustrated the hungry mindset that Payton is pushing.\n\nShoot, even the use of kick returner and Wildcat quarterback Taysom Hill shows how Payton is so aggressively pushing the envelope in the quest for some more Super Bowl glory. On occasion, he\u2019s even taken the ball out of Brees\u2019 hands in the red zone and given it to Hill.\n\nThat\u2019s incredible when considering that Brees, completing 76.3 percent of his passes, is on pace to set the NFL\u2019s single-season record for completion rate by topping his own mark from last year.\n\nThen again, so much of this is about Brees. He may envision playing until he\u2019s in his mid-40s, but in the here and now, he\u2019s 39 and facing a possibly closing window to win another crown.\n\nNo, Bryant doesn\u2019t need to be a No. 1 receiver for the Saints. But the Saints could stand to solidify their No. 2 and No. 3 slots.\n\nAfter Thomas (70 catches, 880 yards, 5 TDs), the next-highest tally for a Saints wide receiver is the 12 receptions by promising rookie Tre\u2019Quan Smith. Kamara (51 receptions) is as potent as any receiver out of the backfield, and tight end Ben Watson (26 catches) is a significant target, too. Putting Bryant in that mix screams huge upside that offset any apparent concerns.\n\nThink Bryant will be a distraction because of his high-strung persona?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to fathom that will be a problem at this point, not after Bryant engaged in so much mud-slinging toward the Cowboys from his couch \u2013 and has now landed with the type of contending team he maintained he wanted to play for, way back when his former team dumped him in April. Bryant needs the Saints more than they need him.\n\nNew Orleans just added a prideful man with a lot of fire to prove that he can still be a big-time baller. It may take a few weeks to catch on to the nuances of a complex offense, but establishing that connection is possible. Just look at Josh Gordon with the Patriots.\n\nSeparation?\n\nBryant, when last seen on a field, wasn\u2019t beating defenders off the line of scrimmage like he used to, and he\u2019s never been the model for crisp route-running. But Brees only needs a tight opening to get the football to the receiver, whose ability to run after the catch could prove valuable. And here\u2019s to guessing that Payton, arguably the NFL\u2019s best play-caller, will know what works best with his new pick-up.\n\nAnd there\u2019s one component of Bryant\u2019s game that probably remains: His hands, when fighting for contested passes. He\u2019s a good bet to win with a ball up for grabs.\n\nPerhaps he\u2019ll get a chance to throw up the X on the biggest stage of all.\n\nFollow Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell.", "", "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Darren Sproles returned to practice Wednesday for the Philadelphia Eagles after missing seven games because of a hamstring injury.\n\nThe veteran running back is expected to play Sunday night against the Dallas Cowboys, according to coach Doug Pederson. The Eagles have the NFL's 18th-ranked rushing offense after finishing third last season when they won the Super Bowl. They lost starter Jay Ajayi to a season-ending knee injury last month.\n\nWendell Smallwood leads the team with 257 yards rushing and has a 4.3 average per carry. Corey Clement has 167 yards but only a 3.3 average. Undrafted rookie Josh Adams had a breakout game in a win over Jacksonville in London, running for 61 yards on nine carries.\n\n\"We've got to make sure as this week goes that he's healthy 100 percent and that he feels great,\" Pederson said of Sproles. \"Again, we're going to just mix him in. I think we're a different team from Week 1 to now. Obviously, we don't have Jay, but Corey has done a great job, Wendell, and now the emergence of Josh. He's kind of stepped up his game and he's played well, particularly this last game, and now we get Darren back.\n\n\"I can't tell you that we're going to feature Darren. I can't tell you that we're going to feature Josh or any of those guys, but Darren is going to be a big part of the game.\"\n\nSproles also would return punts. DeAndre Carter handled those duties during Sproles' absence but was released on Tuesday.\n\nPhiladelphia (4-4) already boosted its offense during the bye week by acquiring wide receiver Golden Tate from Detroit. Tate spent time last week at the practice facility getting familiar with the offense while the rest of the team was away.\n\n\"We've kind of tackled him every single day, trying to get him caught up to just our terminology, the way we call things, how we line up,\" Pederson said. \"But he's been awesome, been in here every day.\"\n\nCarson Wentz couldn't get wait to throw passes to his new target. Tate joins Alshon Jeffery, Nelson Agholor, Jordan Matthews and tight ends Zach Ertz and Dallas Goedert to give Philadelphia another option.\n\n\"Adding a piece like that is exciting, a guy with big play ability that Golden brings,\" Wentz said. \"You see him make highlight plays all the time, just the things he can do after the catch is exciting. He fits in really well with this culture.\"\n\nWentz should have his best blocker back this week. Right tackle Lane Johnson wants to play despite a strained MCL in his left knee. He was injured on the opening series against Jacksonville and was expected to miss significant time.\n\n\"Lane is a tough guy,\" Pederson said. \"In his mind, I think he would want to play, and our expectation is that he does play. But at the same time, I say that, and then I say I don't want to put somebody out there that might be less than 100 percent, too. We'll get him ready. We'll get all our guys ready, like we do each week. The expectation would be that he plays.\"\n\nNotes: CBs Jalen Mills (foot) and Sidney Jones (hamstring) didn't practice and seem unlikely to play Sunday. S Corey Graham (hamstring) returned to the field after missing the past three games. DT Tim Jernigan is also practicing, but probably needs more time after offseason back surgery.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Acosta said he thought it was important for a woman to ask a question about the accusations about Kavanaugh.\n\n\"I wouldn't mind that at all,\" Trump then replied. \"It wouldn't make any difference to me.\"\n\nSanders won't say if press is 'enemy of the people' so Acosta walks out\n\nWith Trump frequently referring to the press as the \"enemy of the people,\" Acosta pressed Sanders to say definitely whether she agrees.\n\nAcosta's question came after Trump's daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump said she does not believe the press is the enemy of the people.\n\nSanders wouldn't answer the question directly during the August news conference, and said the media went after her personally. \"As far as I know I'm the first press secretary in the history of the United States who has required Secret Service protection,\" Sanders said.\n\nAcosta walked out of the conference and tweeted, \"I am totally saddened by what just happened.\"\n\nI walked out of the end of that briefing because I am totally saddened by what just happened.

Samsung shows off a foldable prototype that merges phone and tablet\n\nCLOSE At its developers conference. Time\n\nSure, smartphones have gotten bigger, sleeker screens, but innovation has been pretty lacking beyond that. They've basically looked the same. Until now.\n\nSamsung is bending the mold.\n\nOn Wednesday at its developer conference in San Francisco, Samsung introduced its new Infinity Flex Display, a foldable screen that can allow manufacturers to create new, unique devices such as a phone that folds out to become a tablet-like device with a larger display.\n\n\u201cThe foldable display lays the foundation for a new kind of mobile experience,\" DJ Koh, president and CEO of Samsung IT and mobile communications division, said in a statement. \"We are excited to work with developers on this new platform to create new value for our customers.\"\n\nSamsung foldable display in a traditional phone mode. (Photo: Screenshot)\n\nThe device looks like a traditional phone when closed, before opening to reveal a 7.3-inch screen. Justin Denison, Samsung's senior vice president of mobile product marketing, says the display is durable enough to be folded \"hundreds of thousands of times.\"\n\nAlthough the product shown Wednesday was just a prototype, the company plans to release a consumer product that features the display in 2019 with mass production starting in the \"coming months.\"\n\nDenison says the company will share more on this technology \"in action\" at its next \"Unpacked\" event. Samsung has previously used its \"Unpacked\" events to introduce new Galaxy phones. It traditionally does one in the spring for the Galaxy S line of phones and one in the fall for its Galaxy Note line.\n\nIn addition to creating the hardware, Samsung has partnered with Google to work on the software to make sure Android apps work seamlessly regardless of whether the display is folded in a \"smartphone-like\" mode or opened fully like a tablet. The app you were using when the device is closed will be there when you open up the phone in tablet mode.\n\nWhen the display is fully unfolded, users will be able to have three apps open at once.\n\nGoogle calls these devices \"foldables\" and is adding support for Android developers to begin making apps for the new category. The company showed off a mock-up of its own vision for these new devices on Twitter.\n\nWe just announced support for foldables at #AndroidDevSummit, a new form factor coming next year from Android partners.\n\n\n\nAndroid apps run seamlessly as the device folds, achieving this form factor's chief feature: screen continuity. pic.twitter.com/NAfOmCOY26 \u2014 Android Developers (@AndroidDev) November 7, 2018\n\nIn addition to the new foldable display, Samsung also announced it was working on stretchable and rollable screens, though it did not show off those products on stage.\n\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/07/samsung-shows-off-foldable-prototype-combines-phone-and-tablet-sdc-18/1920851002/", "Trump denies knowing Lil Jon, who was on 'Apprentice'; Omarosa and Twitter call him out\n\nCLOSE Twitter's having a field day after Trump denied knowing \"Celebrity Apprentice\" contestant Lil Jon at the post-midterms press conference.

The goal is for Tannehill to return for the game at Indianapolis on Nov. 25, he and coach Adam Gase said.\n\nBut Tannehill said his shoulder still hurts on every throw. And the bigger issue is a lack of arm strength.\n\n\"The pain I can deal with,\" he said Wednesday, speaking to the media for the first time since he was hurt Oct. 7. \"It's not just pushing through pain. It's physically being able to get the ball where it needs to go.\"\n\nAfter being hurt against Cincinnati, Tannehill rested his arm for 10 days and then began a throwing program. But every pass puts stress on the capsule, and the result when he threw was disappointing, Tannehill said.\n\n\"It just wasn't close to where it needs to be to do the job,\" he said.\n\nWith progress slow and uneven, the Dolphins decided more rest is best.\n\n\"We haven't had the jump that he was looking for,\" Gase said. \"That's why we're kind of taking a step back.\"\n\nA step back sounds like setback, but Tannehill said he's confident he'll play again this season \u2014 perhaps even at Indy.\n\n\"It has been kind of a weird deal,\" he said. \"I'll shut it back down, and we'll see where we're at next week.\"\n\nThe Dolphins have been hit hard by injuries this year. Gase said the status this week of tackles Laremy Tunsil and Ja'Wuan James, both nursing knee injuries, likely won't be determined until shortly before the game.\n\nBoth were limited in practice Wednesday.\n\nTannehill said he expects to play through pain the rest of the year when he returns. There's no indication surgery will be needed after the season, he said.\n\nMiami is 2-2 with Osweiler starting. The Packers game will be the 25th out of the past 30 that Tannehill has missed because of injuries.\n\n\"Whenever you're not able to play, it's extremely hard,\" he said. \"Unfortunately it's part of this business.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The nation\u2019s leading rusher, Wisconsin\u2019s Jonathan Taylor, is headed back east when the Badgers face No. 21 Penn State on Saturday. (AP Photo/Morry Gash, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Jonathan Taylor can go pretty much anywhere at any time when he has the ball in his hands.\n\nThat's trouble for any team that plays Wisconsin. And perhaps creates a little extra - but welcome - work for his teammates.\n\nAlways be aware of where the nation's leading rusher might be. He could break a long run on any carry.\n\n\"Knowing that, you've got be a on a swivel, you've got to know what you're doing,\" receiver A.J. Taylor said. \"It's really about executing at that point. You execute it, he can do it.\"\n\nNext up for the Badgers (6-3, 4-2 Big Ten) is a visit to No. 21 Penn State on Saturday, a game that will allow Jonathan Taylor's family and friends to make the relatively short trip from his hometown of Salem, New Jersey.\n\n\"If I go back East, a lot more of my family members get to come. It's always a good time when they get to see you play,\" he said.\n\nIt would be even sweeter for the star sophomore if he could have another big game.\n\nTaylor bounced back from a 46-yard outing on 11 carries in a 31-17 loss at Northwestern with 208 yards and three scores on 27 carries in a win over Rutgers last week. The touchdown run that had his even his offensive linemen talking was an 18-yarder later in the third quarter giving the Badgers a 24-3 lead.\n\n\"He took a power run backside and the last time I saw someone do that was Melvin,\" right tackle David Edwards said after the game, referring to former Badger and current San Diego Chargers tailback Melvin Gordon.\n\nBeau Benzschawel, Wisconsin's athletic, 6-foot-6 right guard, was pulling on the play in which he was designed to be a lead blocker.\n\nTaylor had other ideas and sprinted to the right for the score.\n\n\"I was like, he wasn't behind me. He should have been behind me,\" Benzschawel recounted on Wednesday.\n\nNot that he was really surprised by Taylor's move. He has been blocking for Taylor for nearly two seasons now.\n\n\"There's definitely a bag of tricks that he has,\" he said.\n\nAveraging 151.4 yards a game, Taylor leads major college teams this season in both 100-yard games (eight) and 200-yard games (three).\n\nThe visit at Beaver Stadium would be a good time for Taylor to break loose again for Wisconsin. The Badgers have lost their last two Big Ten road games, at Michigan and Northwestern, to drop them out of first place in the West Division.\n\nTaylor was limited by the Wildcats in a game in which starting quarterback Alex Hornibrook didn't play because he was in the concussion protocol. Hornibrook is in the protocol again this week after getting hurt again last week against Rutgers, leaving him questionable for the Penn State game.\n\nJack Coan would make his second career start if Hornibrook can't play. Wisconsin might need the sophomore to show he can move the ball through the air in a tough road environment to take at least some pressure off the running game.\n\nThen again, the Badgers ran the ball for all 13 plays of the third quarter against Rutgers, after Coan reliever Hornibrook. They still played away for a win.\n\n\"We've gone against some guys that you know are going to get you the tough yards ... six or four yards or eight yards,\" Penn State coach James Franklin said Tuesday.\n\n\"We've gone against some guys that can take it the distance,\" Franklin said. \"But it's hard to find a guy that can do all those things.\"\n\nTaylor possesses the vision and ability to find a new hole quickly after one closes. He'll hear about it from his blockers, too.\n\nAnd like any good running back, he's shows them gratitude, too.\n\n\"Sometimes I come back and O-linemen are saying 'Way to see it, JT,'\" Taylor said. \"It's always nice to get some appreciation from those guys knowing that I'm doing the best that I can to use their hard-earned work to the fullest and not waste it.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Darnold has a boot on his right foot and is not practicing, leaving his status for the team's game against Buffalo on Sunday in doubt. Darnold was injured during the Jets' 13-6 loss at Miami last Sunday, but finished the game. (AP Photo/Dennis Waszak Jr.) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) \u2014 Sam Darnold could be headed for the sideline this week \u2014 and maybe longer.\n\nThe New York Jets rookie quarterback has a strained right foot, coach Todd Bowles announced Wednesday, leaving Darnold's status for the team's game Sunday against Buffalo in doubt.\n\n\"It's just adversity,\" Darnold said after practice. \"You've just got to deal with it, get better as soon as possible, get back on the field as soon as possible.\"\n\nBowles said it was too early to rule out Darnold for the game, and clarified that the injury was a strain \u2014 not a sprain, contrary to published reports.\n\n\"They've got him listed as day to day,\" Bowles said.\n\nDarnold was surprisingly wearing a boot on his foot at the start of practice Wednesday, and watched in sweats and a green Jets cap as McCown and Davis Webb, currently on the practice squad, threw passes in individual drills.\n\n\"Obviously, I want to be out there with the guys,\" Darnold said. \"I want to go out there and play. Hopefully, if I'm able to go out there and play Sunday, I will. If not, I'm just going to treat it as another learning experience. When adversity hits, it's up to me how to respond. That's all I can worry about.\"\n\nDarnold was injured during the Jets' 13-6 loss at Miami last Sunday , possibly on a fourth-quarter sack by Cameron Wake in which the quarterback came up limping. He took a few other big hits, so he was uncertain as to when the injury occurred.\n\nDarnold finished the game, and said he was \"a little dinged up,\" but didn't indicate he had any serious issues.\n\n\"Yeah, I feel fine,\" Darnold said Monday. \"Some bumps and some bruises, but everything is good.\"\n\nBowles said Monday that Darnold had not expressed to him that he was \"dinged up.\" Bowles typically speaks to the team's trainers later in the afternoon on the day after games.\n\n\"I mean, it was kind of in the midst of the action,\" Darnold explained Wednesday. \"Sometimes, you get hurt or nicked around and things just kind of happen. I just thought I was fine coming out of the game and went through protocol and that's just kind of how it went. Went through some of the tests and something was obviously a little different than usual.\"\n\nDarnold dealt with a broken foot in high school that sidelined him for most of his junior season. He said this is not close to as serious an injury.\n\n\"Like any injury, I'm just going to go about protocol and do exactly what the trainers do and be in here as much as possible and get better,\" he said.\n\nIf Darnold is unable to start, 39-year-old backup Josh McCown would take his place. McCown was the starter last season, but hasn't taken a snap this year as Darnold won the job out of training camp \u2014 beating out both McCown and Teddy Bridgewater.\n\n\"When you're in a backup role, you just go in and do your job,\" McCown said. \"That's the main thing. We'll prepare as if \u2014 like I do every week \u2014 I'm going to be the starter and we'll go from there.\"\n\nDarnold has struggled mightily during the Jets' three-game losing streak, and he leads the NFL with 14 interceptions.\n\nThe No. 3 overall draft pick in April has thrown for 1,934 yards and 11 touchdowns, but his 55.0 percent completion rate and 68.3 quarterback rating rank at the bottom of the league. In his past three games, Darnold has thrown two TD pass and seven interceptions.\n\nThe struggles had some fans and media wondering if perhaps Darnold would benefit from sitting a game or two.\n\nNow, it appears he and the Jets might not have a choice.\n\nNew York has its bye-week break after the game Sunday against Buffalo, and then doesn't play again until Nov. 25, when the Jets take on New England. That could give Darnold a few weeks to rest and heal the foot without missing much time.\n\n\"We don't want to rush things,\" Darnold said. \"That's one thing we don't want to do. I'm eager to get back out there on the field with my guys, but at the same time, I've got to take care of my body, first and foremost.\"\n\nNOTES: WRs Robby Anderson (ankle) and Quincy Enunwa (ankle), TE Neal Sterling (concussion), S Terrence Brooks (illness), C Spencer Long (knee/finger) and NT Steve McLendon didn't practice. ... LBs Frankie Luvu (neck) and Kevin Pierre-Louis (foot), CB Trumaine Johnson (quadriceps) and LG James Carpenter (shoulder) were limited. ... The Jets re-signed RB De'Angelo Henderson to their practice squad. A spot was vacated when Cleveland signed CB Juston Burris off the practice squad.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

For the Nintendo nut: A popular Nintendo Switch\n\nBest gifts for kids of 2018: Nintendo Switch (Photo: Daily Express)\n\nI can't recommend the Nintendo Switch enough. Not only does it work as a home gaming console, you can use it as a handheld as well. Between the versatile hardware and the wide variety of games that are great for kids and the whole family, you're getting a lot of bang for your buck. Nintendo is the most family-friendly console, too. Plus It's the only console that doesn't support voice chat, so you don't have to worry about your kids chatting with strangers online when they play.\n\nWhen it comes to games, popular titles like Mario Kart 8 and Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild are classic options to start with. Plan on taking the Switch with you on a plane? We'd recommend packing it inside the RDS Game Traveler Deluxe Travel Case, which is our favorite Switch carrying case, as it's super rugged.\n\nGet the Nintendo Switch at Amazon for $299\n\n4.

After testing all the top options, we named Puro's headphones the best headphones for kids for those features as well as their consistent ability to play only at safe levels for developing ears.\n\nBut you should note that while they should fit elementary-aged kids just fine, they're a little big for toddler-sized ears. They're also a little pricier than most kid headphones.

However, the biggest selling point here is that it's very comfortable to use, meaning your budding gamer can grind away at Minecraft or Fortnite for hours on end. That said, it's also expensive, so it might be a better gift for an older or more responsible kid.\n\nGet the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller at Amazon for $146.98\n\n8. For the flyer: An affordable drone\n\nBest gifts for kids of 2018: Potensic T25 Drone (Photo: Reviewed / Adam Doud)\n\nThe Potensic T25 drone is our top pick for drones under $200.

It should be a good one in prime time.\n\nPittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin, who's 1-1 in Super Bowls, isn't admitting any postseason thoughts are in the minds of his players or himself. But he has to like how the Steelers have performed in four straight victories.\n\n\"I'm not trying to look for specific areas, I just try to challenge these guys to get better every day,\" Tomlin says.\n\n\"That's what we're focused on. I think that if we do that daily that will give us a chance to produce consistent performances that are on the rise. Not only in the second quarter (of the season) but as we continue through this journey.\"\n\nThat journey has Carolina (6-2), ranked fifth in the AP Pro32, at No. 7 Pittsburgh. The Steelers (5-2-1) are a 5\u00bd-point favorite in the week's best matchup.\n\nThe Panthers have won three straight and five of six. They are particularly strong running the ball, though Pittsburgh is stingy in that area on defense.\n\nCarolina trails New Orleans by one game in the NFC South and leads the wild-card chase.

(Photo: Scott Olson, Getty Images)\n\nIt's back!\n\nA chunk of the polar vortex is forecast to slide over the central and eastern United States over the next few days, marking its first unwelcome visit of the season. In many locations, temperatures will be more like mid-January than mid-November.\n\n\"It\u2019s time to start talking about the polar vortex,\" said weather.us meteorologist Ryan Maue. \u201cIf your furnace is on the fritz, then perhaps it's a good time to get that fixed.\u201d\n\nThrough much of the rest of this week, high temperatures in parts of the northern Rockies and northern Plains will struggle to rise above 32 degrees each day, the Weather Channel said. For example, Bismarck, North Dakota, may only briefly rise above freezing this weekend.\n\nThe cold will sweep into the Northeast by the weekend, where daytime highs may struggle to get out of the 30s and 40s Saturday and Sunday.\n\nSnow is also coming with the cold in some areas, including across the central Plains on Wednesday night into Thursday, where 2-6 inches of snow is forecast.\n\nSnow is also likely Friday and Saturday near the Great Lakes, including potentially heavy lake-effect snow in the usual snowbelt regions of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York, according to AccuWeather.\n\nLake-effect snow, which can last for only a few minutes to several days, falls from narrow bands of clouds that form when cold, dry arctic air passes over a large, relatively mild lake. These snows can occur only in the fall or early winter, before the lakes freeze over.\n\n\"The frigid air passing over the still-warm Great Lakes will increase chances for lake-effect snow,\" said AccuWeather meteorologist Steve Travis. It could be the first major lake-effect snow event for many, he added.\n\nIn heavier snow bands, there could be enough snow piling up to require plowing and shoveling.\n\nThe cold forecast has sent natural gas prices soaring, CNBC reported.\n\nIf the cold persists this fall and winter, natural gas prices could rise above $5 or $6 per million British thermal units \u2013 a measurement of energy \u2013 for weeks at a time, Jen Snyder of RS Energy told CNBC.

Although it's been understood by scientists for several decades, it only entered the popular lexicon as a synonym for miserably cold winter weather a few years ago.\n\nThe vortex is strongest during the winter and usually weakens or even disappears in the summer. Its position determines what part of the USA the Arctic air will invade.\n\nIf you're looking for a return to milder weather in the East, you may be in luck. After this Arctic blast, temperatures may rebound to average or even above-average levels later in November, according to Judah Cohen, a meteorologist with Atmospheric and Environmental Research (AER). This is because the polar vortex should return to its rightful place way up north, awaiting its next, yet-to-be-determined visit.\n\nTime to start talking about the #PolarVortex again as an Arctic Blast is may advance on the Lower 48 next week.

(Photo: ROBERT DEUTSCH/USA TODAY)\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 In \"The Girl in the Spider's Web,\" Claire Foy trades the upper crust for uppercuts as the fist-throwing, computer-hacking, dragon-tattooed vigilante Lisbeth Salander.\n\nRiding a motorcycle and shooting fight scenes for the crime thriller (in theaters Friday), \"I ended up doing a lot of the (stunts) myself,\" says the actress, who won an Emmy Award in September for playing Queen Elizabeth II on Netflix's \"The Crown.\"\n\n\"I am the new Tom Cruise,\" she says. \"Just kidding. Please don't take that out of context.\"\n\n\"Spider's Web\" is adapted from the 2015 novel by David Lagercrantz, which itself is a continuation of the late Stieg Larsson's best-selling \"Millennium\" trilogy. The latter books were adapted as a Swedish-language film series starring Noomi Rapace and later into 2011's \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" with Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara. Although the American remake netted strong reviews and a best-actress Oscar nomination for Mara, it underwhelmed at the box office and two planned sequels were scrapped.\n\nClaire Foy did many of her own stunts shooting \"The Girl in the Spider's Web\" in Sweden last winter. (Photo: REINER BAJO/SONY PICTURES VIA AP)\n\nNow, the movie franchise has been rebooted with fourth book \"Spider's Web,\" which picks up with a more monastic Lisbeth than viewers might remember. Far removed from her incendiary detective work with journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Sverrir Gudnason) in \"Dragon Tattoo,\" Lisbeth has largely retreated to her cavernous warehouse apartment in Stockholm, save for the occasional lover and vengeful act against so-called \"men who hate women.\" But she's brought out of semiretirement to hack into a defense program containing nuclear codes, which are coveted by ruthless Russian mobsters and her long-lost evil sister, Camilla (Sylvia Hoeks).\n\nReview: 'The Girl in the Spider's Web' mires Claire Foy in familiar Bond-lite action\n\nMore: Why author David Lagercrantz is 'obsessed' with Lisbeth Salander\n\nAs a fan of the previous big-screen installments, Foy, 34, initially was skeptical of reviving the series.\n\n\"I was like, what else is there to do? It's been done, and I thought Rooney's and Noomi's performances couldn't get better,\" Foy says. But after meeting with director Fede Alvarez (2016's horror hit \"Don't Breathe\"), \"I re-read the books and started to think about things I had never really thought about the character.\"\n\nClaire Foy opted for a more subdued look for Lisbeth this go-around, to reflect her character's growth from her younger, wilder days in \"Dragon Tattoo,\" and to show a woman just trying to blend into society. (Photo: NADJA KLIER/AP)\n\nBy the time she walked onto the set just two weeks after wrapping Neil Armstrong biopic \"First Man\" (in theaters now), \"I felt sort of like the custodian of Lisbeth, like if I didn't stand up for her, no one else was going to.\"\n\nProduction on \"Spider's Web\" started in January, just three months after the #MeToo movement upended Hollywood and forced men to reconsider how they treat women. As a result, the director says, \"I felt a big responsibility, more than ever, to really listen to (Foy) and not create a female character out of my own male imagination and fantasy.

And while the character does appear naked at times, Foy questioned the necessity of sex scenes in the script, which Alvarez in turn cut.\n\n\"I probably made everyone\u2019s life quite difficult because I sometimes just refused to do things that felt wrong for Lisbeth \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to wear that or put that makeup on, and that didn\u2019t feel right,\" Foy says. \"But I\u2019m really pleased I did, because it keeps the essence of the character.\"\n\nRooney Mara's dramatic transformation into waifish hacker Lisbeth Salander in David Fincher's \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" earned her an Oscar nomination.

(\"It's reductive,\" she says. \"#MeToo is the culmination and continuation of something that's been going on for hundreds of years.\") But she does acknowledge the movement and the character have helped give her confidence in her own voice.\n\nIn this past year, \"I have noticed a huge difference in my own faith that I am allowed to speak up,\" Foy says. \"It doesn't mean that I'm a terrible person or that I'm rocking the boat. It just means that I have just as much right as anybody else on set to say, 'I'm not sure this is right, actually. Is there not something we should do about this?' And if I say that, people have to listen; you can't ignore someone.\n\n\"And I never felt like that before. I kept my mouth shut: 'Don't say anything, smile, be nice to everyone and don't cause trouble.' And I hope that now, other people feel (empowered) as well.\"\n\nClaire Foy picked up her first Emmy Award for outstanding lead actress for period drama \"The Crown.\" (Photo: DAN MacMEDAN/USA TODAY)\n\nIn March, Foy became an unwilling face of the #TimesUp movement, when it was revealed that her \"Crown\" co-star Matt Smith was paid more than her, though he had less screen time as Elizabeth's husband Prince Philip. (Despite reports that she would receive $275,000 in back pay, Foy told Al Arabiya several months later that she never received it.) Although Foy wasn't surprised by the outrage over the wage gap, it's still not a subject she wishes to dwell on.\n\nIf she's learned anything from the experience, it's that \"the conversation goes on,\" she says, shaking her head. \"I'm not ashamed of it, but at the same time, I don\u2019t know what else I can say. I\u2019m very pleased that there\u2019s a very strong example of (wage inequality) out there.

High School by his father, LaVar, before his junior season for some insane reasons.\n\nAt the time LaMelo was considered a five-star recruit committed to UCLA. But once the middle brother, LiAngelo Ball, was arrested during UCLA\u2019s trip to China, LaVar launched a hastily built plan for his sons that included 24 Hour Fitness open runs, a stint with a last-place Lithuanian pro club, being \u201cthe face\u201d of a dysfunctional JBA startup league and an overseas JBA tour. All this while a reality TV crew followed their every move.\n\nAfter all that \u2014 which included a backwards leap off a moving golf cart \u2014 LaMelo Ball is heading back to high school in the U.S. LaVar announced on Tuesday that his youngest son would attend SPIRE Institute in Geneva, Ohio, for his senior year and get his diploma. LaMelo followed the announcement up with an Instagram post and tweet of his own.\n\nI\u2019ve decided to return to highschool and complete my senior year. I thank my dad for the JBA Experience and playing overseas. I\u2019ve been accepted to attend Spire Prep Academy in Geneva, Ohio where i look forward to earning my highschool diploma and winning with my new team! pic.twitter.com/FQzta0PiNE \u2014 Melo (@MELOD1P) November 6, 2018\n\nYet, if he can play in high school, could LaMelo still find himself playing for the Bruins next season? It won\u2019t be easy \u2014 if not already impossible.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Spire\u2019s associate academy director Justin Brantley said LaMelo preserved his eligibility because he was not compensated in Lithuania and the JBA. When reached for comment, Brantley told For The Win that the school\u2019s legal department looked into LaMelo\u2019s situation prior to his acceptance at the school, but he was not privy to the details.\n\nAssuming LaMelo is all set to compete at the high school level, that\u2019s huge news. Spire competes against legitimate high school and prep competition like La Lumiere and Oak Hill. On Dec. 3, LaMelo will face off against the No. 3 player in the class of 2019, Cole Anthony. He wasn\u2019t going to get pushed by continuing to play European B Teams, and he certainly wasn\u2019t going to get noticed. By moving to SPIRE, college and pro scouts will once again get to evaluate LaMelo. At the very least, that will help LaMelo prepare for the 2020 NBA draft. He wasn\u2019t getting anything out of this competition.\n\nBut LaMelo being granted eligibility at SPIRE \u2014 a non-traditional high school \u2014 does not equate to NCAA eligibility.\n\nBefore LaMelo joined BC Vytautas, he signed with Lonzo\u2019s agent Harrison Gaines. Even if we were to believe that the Ball family didn\u2019t completely burn the UCLA bridge, LaMelo forfeited his NCAA eligibility when he signed with that agent and joined a professional team.\n\nVia the NCAA:\n\nAccepting significant benefits from an agent and signing or agreeing to be represented by an agent are among the most serious violations from a student-athlete reinstatement perspective, and generally carry with them a determination that the student-athlete\u2019s eligibility should not be reinstated. These acts clearly professionalize an individual.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty cut and dried \u2014 LaMelo\u2019s college eligibility is gone.\n\nOn top of that, the NCAA was already concerned that LaMelo had his own signature shoe from LaVar\u2019s Big Baller Brand. He was a qualifying risk before the move overseas, and given the climate in college basketball, it would be tough to see them giving LaVar leeway here.\n\nOf course, the NCAA did announce rule changes in August that included allowing select \u201celite\u201d high school prospects to hire agents. When reached for clarification, an NCAA spokesperson told For The Win that the rule changes wouldn\u2019t take effect until the NBA and NBPA enacted their own rule changes for draft eligibility \u2014 basically, the one-and-done rule needs to end before the agent waiver even becomes a factor.\n\nESPN obtained a memo in June that said the NBA wouldn\u2019t consider changing the draft age until at least 2021, and by that point, LaMelo would already by eligible for the NBA draft. It would take a sudden and unexpected change to the one-and-done rule in the next six months (which almost certainly won\u2019t happen) for LaMelo to end up at UCLA.\n\nFor now, LaMelo\u2019s options beyond SPIRE would be the G League, JBA or another trip overseas. Still, it\u2019s almost stunning that him making it to UCLA was even a possibility.", "New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees (9) dives as he scrambles for yardage in the first half of an NFL football game against the Los Angeles Rams in New Orleans, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018. (AP Photo/Bill Feig) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThe Rams and Saints again showed the value of stacking lineups in daily fantasy football contests as they erupted Sunday for 80 total points and more than 280 fantasy points in point-per-reception leagues.\n\nDrew Brees, Michael Thomas, Alvin Kamara, Jared Goff, Brandin Cooks and Cooper Kupp all cracked the 20-point threshold and a few savvy owners were able to fit in combinations of these players into their lineups.\n\nWith a high anticipated game total a lot of the ownership went to Todd Gurley (26 percent owned) and Goff (17 percent owned) leaving much lower ownership on Brees (6 percent owned) in daily tournaments. With a back and forth game, it ended up being Brees stacked with Thomas and Kamara vaulting DFS players up the leaderboards.\n\nGame stacking is important but equally important is trying to find ways to identify low ownership in games with high expected totals, allowing you to separate yourself from the field. Brees out-produced Goff at the same price and lower ownership, which provided the separation necessary to win. This week, there are a few spots where high potential upside can be found at reduced ownership or pricing.\n\nCHIEFS-CARDINALS\n\nKansas City has the highest implied team total on the slate with 33 points expected at home against the Arizona Cardinals. The Chiefs are averaging 36.3 points per game on the season and rank within the top 5 in the NFL in both total offense and passing yards per game. Patrick Mahomes has carried only modest ownership (10 percent) in DFS contests and has been producing the most lately when paired with RB Kareem Hunt and TE Travis Kelce, who now has double digit fantasy points in every game since Week 1.\n\nWith so much emphasis in the fantasy community on recent results, fantasy owners are likely to overlook Tyreek Hill, who was just 5 percent owned in DFS contests last week compared to 30 percent ownership on Hunt and 17 percent on Kelce. DailyRoto's DFS ownership projections expect that to continue and it leaves Hill as a contrarian tournament target who has double digit fantasy performances in eight of nine weeks this season and two 40-plus point games. Pairing up Mahomes with Hill offers high upside and lower ownership this week.\n\nSAINTS-BENGALS\n\nNew Orleans also has a high team total this week and Brees, Thomas and Kamara will be popular plays after going off in the last game. While their projections will be strong again this week, DailyRoto projections suggest that pivoting to RB Mark Ingram can save salary and be a contrarian tournament target. Ingram's $6,800 FanDuel price and $4,500 DraftKings price are among the lowest they have been over the last four seasons.\n\nSince his return in Week 5, Ingram has still played on roughly 50 percent of the Saints offensive snaps, receiving an average of 12.5 carries and 2.5 targets per game. This role is comparable to his role down the stretch in the 2017 offense that saw Ingram put up 15-plus fantasy points in five separate games from Week 10 through the end of the regular season.\n\nThe biggest concern for Ingram isn't Kamara but perhaps Taysom Hill's role in the red zone, where he has seen nine opportunities and can eat into some of Ingram's goal line work. Despite this, Ingram projects as a solid RB value this week and one that should be low owned. In additional to providing leverage against popular Saints players, Ingram also is the same price as RB Dion Lewis, who DailyRoto projects as one of the highest owned players on the slate.\n\n___\n\nFor more in-depth daily fantasy insights and tools, visit DailyRoto: https://dailyroto.com\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

AT&T has had piracy policies in place for years, and the company did not change them as a result of the merger.\n\nThis appears to be one of the first times AT&T has enforced its piracy policy directly.

(AP Photo/Ron Jenkins, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMETAIRIE, La. (AP) \u2014 Dez Bryant has found a new team, agreeing to join the already prolific offense of the surging New Orleans Saints.\n\nThe former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, who has been looking for an NFL home since becoming a free agent in April, will now have a chance to catch passes from one of the most prolific quarterbacks in NFL history in New Orleans' Drew Brees.\n\n\"There is certainly a skillset that he has that is going to be beneficial. So I look forward to getting to work with him. I look forward to building a rapport with him. I look forward to getting him involved in this offense and just become a complement to all the guys that we already have,\" Brees said. \"He'll be a great addition.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old Bryant and the Saints agreed to contract terms on Wednesday, and it remains unclear to what extent Bryant will play when New Orleans visits Cincinnati on Sunday.\n\nBryant spent his first eight years in the NFL with Dallas and last season caught 69 passes for 838 yards and six touchdowns, including a 50-yard scoring play, for the Cowboys.\n\nHowever, his professional reputation has been marred at times by public confrontations with coaches and teammates during games and practices.\n\nVeteran Saints tight end Ben Watson said players in New Orleans' locker room must guard against pre-judging Bryant based on superficial observations from old television clips without knowing all the facts or how Bryant has evolved personally since.\n\n\"I don't know Dez. I wasn't in the locker room with him in Dallas. I don't know all the dynamics,\" Watson said. \"I also don't know what's transpired with him personally since that situation. So the great thing about a locker room, I think, is we take guys in and we say, 'Hey, what are you like now?'\"\n\nSeeking salary cap relief, the Cowboys released Bryant after last season with two years remaining on the receiver's five-year, $70 million contract.\n\nLast season was Bryant's best since he caught 88 passes for 1,320 yards and 16 TDs in 2014, which at the time was his third consecutive season with at least 1,200 yards receiving. He signed his last Cowboys contract right after that, but has not approached that level of production since \u2014 a central reason Dallas released him in April.\n\n\"What matters is, what are we going to do for the next eight games?\" said Watson, who played for the Patriots when running back Corey Dillon arrived with a reputation as a malcontent from Cincinnati in 2004 and helped New England win a Super Bowl.\n\nWatson was still with the Patriots in 2007 when they added another perceived malcontent in receiver Randy Moss, who caught 23 of Tom Brady's NFL-record 50 TD passes that season.\n\n\"People change over time and there are certain factors you just don't know about. So we just move forward,\" Watson said. \"If somebody's new, you have a clean slate and you embrace that person because now they're your teammate.\"\n\nBryant was among several receivers to work out for the Saints on Tuesday. He'd previously met with Cleveland and Baltimore.\n\nNew Orleans (7-1), which has won seven straight and leads the NFC South, didn't necessarily need another receiver.\n\nLed by the record-setting Brees, the Saints rank seventh on offense overall, averaging 402.2 yards per game, and seventh in passing, averaging 289.9 yards. At the same time, New Orleans is without deep threat Ted Ginn Jr., who is currently on injured reserve and won't be eligible to return until the final few weeks of the season, if he's ready by then.\n\nThe Saints also have yet to receive consistent production from Cameron Meredith, a former Chicago receiving leader who was acquired in free agency, but who also is trying to come back from major knee surgery that wiped out his 2017 season.\n\nBryant's return to the NFL with the Saints means he could play against his former club in a few weeks. The Saints play at Dallas on Nov. 29.\n\n\"They're getting a great receiver. He goes up and attacks the ball better than I've seen anyone,\" Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliot said. \"He's definitely a special player and I'm glad he got picked up and I'm glad something worked out for him.\"\n\nAdded Cowboys coach Jason Garrett: \"I'm happy he has an opportunity to go play and finish the right way, it will be a great environment for him to go out and make an impact.\"\n\nNew Orleans also has two games remaining against division rival Carolina (6-2).\n\n\"The nice thing is we don't play them until December, so we will get an opportunity to see what they are doing with him,\" Panthers coach Ron Rivera said shortly after hearing about Bryant's agreement with the Saints. \"He's a good player.

(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump had a number of confrontational exchanges with White House reporters Wednesday during a news conference to discuss the results of Tuesday's election.\n\nTrump refused to answer a follow-up question from CNN reporter Jim Acosta, who persisted in his attempt to ask the president about the Russia investigation into interference in the 2016 presidential election. Trump spoke loudly over Acosta \u2013 with whom he has clashed repeatedly \u2013 and demanded he hand over the microphone to White House staff.\n\n\"That's enough,\" Trump said repeatedly as Acosta continued to try to ask his question.\n\nWhen a White House aide tried to take the mic from him, Acosta yanked it back.\n\n\"On the Russia investigation, are you concerned that you may ... ?\" Acosta managed to get out before Trump interrupted him: \"I'm not concerned about anything with the Russia investigation because it's a hoax.\"\n\nPresident Trump to Jim @Acosta: \"You should let me run the country.

I appreciate it,\" Trump said sardonically.\n\nWhen Acosta continued to tell Trump the caravan was not an invasion, the president told the reporter: \"I think you should let me run the country, you run CNN. And if you did it well, your ratings would be much better.\"\n\nLater, American Urban Radio Networks correspondent April Ryan tried to ask Trump something while he was answering another reporter's question about voter suppression.\n\n\"Sit down, please. Sit down! I didn't call you,\" Trump told Ryan. He then finished explaining that he considered CNN's \"inaccurate\" polling a form of voter suppression.\n\nWhen Trump called on another reporter, Ryan again tried to shout a question to the president. He repeated his demand that she sit down.\n\n\"It's such a hostile media. It's so sad,\" he said.\n\nAt another point, Trump accused \"PBS Newshour\" correspondent Yamiche Alcindor of asking a \"racist question\" when she asked him about his embrace of the term \"nationalist.\"\n\n\"When they go low, we keep doing our jobs,\" Acosta later told CNN host Jake Tapper when asked about being personally attacked by the president. \"We just can't be intimidated.\"\n\nAcosta said Trump \"doesn't like being called out for his falsehoods\" and that he believed the president on edge because of losing the House in the midterm election and said his opening remarks \"sounded very much like a pity party.\"\n\n\"The president is not used to seeing himself lose, and he lost big,\" Acosta said.\n\nAcosta also said Trump \"time and again seemed to be attacking journalists of color,\" referring to his exchanges with Ryan and Alcindor.\n\n\"This President's ongoing attacks on the press have gone too far,\" CNN said in a statement Wednesday. \"They are not only dangerous, they are disturbingly un-American.\"\n\nTrump frequently attacks the media, and he often hones in on Acosta and his employer, CNN. Their clashes date back to the days before Trump even took office.\n\nNine days before his inauguration, Trump attacked CNN for going \"out of their way\" to report on the salacious allegations against him in the \"Steele Dossier,\" which purported to outline Trump's connections to Russia.\n\nAt that news conference Jan. 11, the then-president-elect told Acosta, \"You're organization's terrible,\" and \"don't be rude.\"\n\n\"You are fake news.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/07/donald-trump-jim-acosta-white-house-news-conference/1920107002/", "", "These are among the Ortho-Novum pills recalled by Janssen Pharmaceuticals.

It turns an already-powerful offense into a nightmarish one by season\u2019s end.\n\nBut how does it affect fantasy football owners? Let\u2019s break down Bryant\u2019s value and that of the rest of the relevant players in the Saints\u2019 offense.\n\nDez Bryant\n\nWhen we last saw the ex-Cowboy in 2017, he wasn\u2019t throwing up the \u201cX\u201d as much as he used to: He totaled 838 yards and six touchdowns, with a career-low 12.1 yards per catch. At age 30, the 6-foot-2 receiver isn\u2019t quite as spry as he used to be.\n\nHaving said all that: In a few weeks, it\u2019s POSSIBLE he\u2019s the No. 2 receiver in New Orleans. That\u2019s kind of a big deal when you consider there\u2019s no one behind Michael Thomas who has taken the job \u2014 Ted Ginn Jr. is on IR, Cameron Meredith is a disappointment, Tre-Quan Smith is a rookie who\u2019s gotten some occasional looks and tight end Benjamin Watson is the team\u2019s third-leading receiver.\n\nSo there\u2019s room for a wily vet who\u2019s known for prowess in the red zone. He doesn\u2019t need to be the top option like he was in Dallas to thrive. Go pick him up, stash him on your bench and hope that he becomes what Josh Gordon is with the Patriots: A startable WR2 at best you can depend on.\n\nMichael Thomas\n\nMaybe he loses a few red zone looks come playoff time. But overall, there\u2019s no stopping Thomas this season \u2014 did you know he\u2019s caught 70 of his 79 targets? That\u2019s nuts!!! He\u2019s still a WR1, especially because if Bryant can draw away even the slightest bit of attention away from Thomas, it\u2019ll only help.\n\nTre\u2019Quan Smith\n\nI had some hopes he was emerging as the No. 2 wideout option Drew Brees could use, and he may be useful for a few weeks as Bryant learns the playbook. Keep him in deep leagues and see what happens.\n\nAlvin Kamara\n\nHe\u2019s basically the team\u2019s second receiver with 51 catches for 427 yards. Someone has to lose opportunities when Bryant gets comfortable, but I still don\u2019t think he\u2019s the one who suffers \u2014 he\u2019s too valuable when he gets the ball in space.\n\nBenjamin Watson\n\nI think he\u2019s the player who will take the biggest hit, which kind of stinks in a year in which there are so few tight ends who are fantasy relevant. He\u2019s only been targeted 32 times, however, so he wasn\u2019t all that valuable to begin with.", "FILE - In this Nov. 5, 2017, file photo, Carolina Panthers' Mario Addison (97) warms up before an NFL football game against the Atlanta Falcons in Charlotte, N.C. The Panthers face the Steelers on Thursday in Pittsburgh. (AP Photo/Bob Leverone) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Cam Newton spent a portion of the summer studying Ben Roethlisberger and working out alongside Antonio Brown, something the Carolina Panthers quarterback did out of a mix of curiosity and respect.\n\nNewton found himself enamored of Roethlisberger's footwork \u2014 \"The play is never over for Big Ben\" \u2014 and Brown's relentlessness.\n\n\"He's literally like a nocturnal beast,\" Newton said of Brown. \"I thought I was bad. ... We had late workouts. I'm talking like 10 p.m-.ish. It was like our second or third one of the day. Whenever he feels the urge to work, he works and I respect it.\"\n\nNewton will get an up-close look at Roethlisberger, Brown and the rest of the Steelers (5-2-1) when the Panthers (6-2) make a rare trip to Pittsburgh. Maybe it's the workouts with Brown. Maybe it's the rapport he's developed with offensive coordinator Norv Turner. Maybe it's the emergence of running back Christian McCaffrey. Whatever it is, Newton is in the midst of his finest season since winning league MVP in 2015.\n\nMaybe that's why Roethlisberger just laughed when asked if there's any wisdom he might pass along to Newton.\n\n\"I do not need to give him advice,\" Roethlisberger said. \"He's Superman.\"\n\nA Man of Steel who could be a handful for a resilient Pittsburgh defense. The Steelers were a hot mess during the first month of the season but have figured out things during their four-game winning streak. Pittsburgh is allowing just 275.5 yards per game over the last month. That's from a combination of the rapid cohesion of a revamped secondary and spending less time on the field thanks to an offense starting to hog the ball behind second-year running back James Conner.\n\nStill, the Panthers present their own unique challenge. Carolina might be the NFL's closest approximation to a throwback. The Panthers have run for at least 121 yards in seven of eight games, with Newton serving as the catalyst. At 29 he's on pace for a career high in rushing attempts, a mixture of Turner's creative play calling and Newton's pragmatic approach to when he tucks the ball and takes off. While he's still happy to deliver a shot now and then, he's more likely to slide before getting hit.\n\nPittsburgh, fourth in the league in sacks, is determined to make sure Newton doesn't get loose.\n\n\"There's no way he can duck 10 bullets,\" Steelers defensive tackle Cam Heyward said. \"If everybody is shooting their shot, someone is bound to hit. That's got to be group effort. ... It's a heck of a test.\"\n\nSome things to watch for as Pittsburgh looks to extend its hot streak while Carolina searches for the franchise's first win in the Steel City:\n\nLE'VEON WHO?\n\nWayward Steelers running back Le'Veon Bell is nearing the end of his months-long standoff with the club. He has until Nov. 13 to report and sign his one-year franchise tender if he wants to make sure he accrues the service time necessary to hit the open market next spring. After some initial angst, Bell's teammates have moved on. Conner is thriving in Bell's absence. He's second in the league in total yards and is the first player in team history to have 10 total touchdowns through eight games.\n\n\"James Conner has been rolling and bulldozing people,\" Brown said.\n\nGIMME THAT\n\nCarolina is winning the turnover battle. The Panthers have been even or positive in turnovers in seven of eight games and are 6-1 in those games. They are 5-0 when winning the turnover battle outright.\n\nCarolina is fourth in the league in turnover differential with a plus-8, sixth in points off turnovers (51), seventh in total takeaways (15), and tied for fourth in interceptions (11) behind speedy rookie cornerback Donte Jackson, who has four picks.\n\nSince 2015, Carolina leads the NFL with 102 takeaways and is second with 62 interceptions.\n\nFEISTY FEILER\n\nPittsburgh right tackle Matt Feiler will likely make his third straight start in place of injured Marcus Gilbert. An undrafted free agent, Feiler is thriving while opening up holes for Conner and helping keep Roethlisberger clean. Roethlisberger has been sacked twice during Pittsburgh's winning streak. Feiler's success isn't exactly unprecedented. Three members of Pittsburgh's current starting offensive line \u2014 Feiler, left guard Ramon Foster and left tackle Alejandro Villanueva \u2014 all went undrafted.\n\n\"It's how we're built,\" Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said. \"It's what we expect, and (Feiler) is just the latest example of a guy that is meeting that expectation like we talked about. He's capable, so it's understandable to expect those types of performances from him.\"\n\nSTOPPING ADDISON\n\nFuture Hall of Famer Julius Peppers may have more name power, but Mario Addison has been the more productive defensive end for Carolina. Addison leads the team with 7 \u00bd sacks, including a sack trifecta last week against Tampa Bay.\n\nOver the past 38 games, Addison has 28 sacks.\n\n\"I'm a pretty strong guy,\" said the 6-foor-3, 260-pound Addison. \"People underestimate me because I look kind of small, but I pack a punch. By the time they miss and my hands get on the inside of them, I'm running them back and they're like 'Dang, this guy's stronger than I thought.'\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Steve Reed contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A 10-2 finish would make Kentucky a prime candidate for a New Year's Six bowl.\n\nKentucky's biggest challenge may come Saturday when the Wildcats close their SEC schedule at Tennessee, where they have lost 16 straight and haven't won since 1984. Kentucky follows that up by hosting Middle Tennessee and visiting Louisville.\n\n\"We have to be motivated the same way again this week, and each and every week,\" Kentucky coach Mark Stoops said. \"That gets to be the challenge as you get through the grind of the season. You get late in the year here, sometimes that monotony sets in, and we can't let that happen.\"\n\nANOTHER TEXAS A&M NOSEDIVE?\n\nOne reason Texas A&M fired coach Kevin Sumlin after last season was the Aggies always seemed to fall apart in November.\n\nTurns out the new coach might have the same problem.\n\nFirst-year coach Jimbo Fisher and the Aggies (5-4, 3-3) are trying to bounce back from a two-game losing skid when they host Ole Miss on Saturday.\n\n\"Learning to win is a learned behavior,\" Fisher said. \"Learning to dominate a game is a learned behavior. And we have to put ourselves in those experiences as much as we possibly can to understand how to do that.\"\n\nTENNESSEE, VANDERBILT BOWL ELGIBLITY\n\nAfter going winless in SEC competition last year, Tennessee (4-5, 1-4) has a chance to become bowl eligible in Jeremy Pruitt's debut season as coach. The Vols must win two of their last three games \u2014 they host Kentucky and Missouri the next two weeks before visiting Vanderbilt.\n\n\"We worked really hard this offseason just trying to make changes from where we made mistakes last year,\" Tennessee linebacker Darrin Kirkland Jr. said. \"It was definitely disappointing being at home last year during the Christmas and bowl season. We've definitely worked really hard to get back on that stage.\"\n\nVanderbilt (4-5, 1-4) has similar hopes and travels to Missouri this week before hosting Ole Miss and Tennessee. Don't be surprised if a bowl bid is at stake Nov. 24 when Vanderbilt hosts Tennessee to end the regular season.\n\n\"It's November,\" Vanderbilt coach Derek Mason said. \"It's winning time.\"\n\nARKANSAS' LAST CHANCES\n\nIt's been a rough season for Arkansas and first-year coach Chad Morris, which could finish with a winless SEC record for the first time since 2013.\n\nThe Razorbacks (2-7, 0-5) have been competitive in several league games, especially against Texas A&M and Ole Miss. But their schedule down the stretch is not easy: They host No. 9 LSU on Saturday before travelling to face No. 18 Mississippi State and Missouri in the final two games.\n\nDREW LOCK MOVING UP CHARTS\n\nLock has 11,089 career yards passing to rank sixth in SEC history. Lock has no shot at breaking former Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray's SEC record of 13,166, but the Missouri senior should get to second place on the list.\n\nLock has three more regular-season games plus the possibility of a bowl game. Ranking second on the SEC's career passing yardage list is David Greene, who threw for 11,528 yards at Georgia from 2001-04.\n\nAUBURN'S FINISH\n\nAuburn's started the season as a top 10 team, but losses to LSU, Mississippi State and Tennessee sent the program tumbling completely out of the SEC title race.\n\nThe Tigers (6-3, 3-3, No. 24 CFP) have bounced back with recent wins over Ole Miss and Texas A&M and have a chance to get some even bigger wins when they face Georgia (on Saturday) and Alabama (Nov. 24).\n\nAuburn beat both teams last season before losing to Georgia in a rematch in the SEC championship game.\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA GOING FOR TWO\n\nSouth Carolina (5-3, 4-3) must win at Florida this week to post winning SEC records in back-to-back seasons for just the fourth time since entering the league in 1992. Gamecocks quarterback Jake Bentley says Muschamp has pointed that out to South Carolina's players.'\n\n\"It's just a matter of pride,\" Bentley said. \"We've played this game since we were five years old and no one likes to lose. It's about just taking a stand and doing whatever it takes to get wins. That's what this team's mindset has switched to.

There is also a real comfort level working with the JGR team and I wanted to stay in the Toyota family.\n\n\u201cWe still have big goals for the remainder of this season, but it\u2019s nice to know what we will be doing in 2019.\u201d\n\nPearn was promoted from lead engineer to crew chief for the No. 78 team in 2015 and has guided the team to 17 wins.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of everything we\u2019ve been able to accomplish over the past few years out of Denver and the move to JGR will make the transition for 2019 an easy one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great organization with a lot of great people and a leadership team that wants to win.\u201d\n\nSuarez, meanwhile, is looking for a new job. The Mexican won the 2016 Xfinity Series title driving for Gibbs and two months later was unexpectedly promoted to the Cup Series when Carl Edwards walked away from NASCAR.\n\nEdwards\u2019 retirement put Toyota\u2019s long-term development plan in flux. Suarez had been expected to succeed Erik Jones at Furniture Row, where he\u2019d been stashed by Gibbs in 2017 and was supposed to remain until a Gibbs seat opened. Then Suarez was expected to move into the second Furniture Row car while he waited for a Gibbs seat.\n\nInstead, Gibbs had to bring Suarez up early while Jones drove last season as Truex\u2019s teammate. Gibbs brought Jones in-house this season, but there was no room remaining for Suarez once Visser put his plans in motion.\n\nSuarez has 21 top-10 finishes and one pole in two seasons with JGR. He\u2019s currently ranked 20th in the Cup standings, the same place he finished last year.\n\n\u201cWe really appreciate everything Daniel has done for Joe Gibbs Racing over these past several years,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cHe has made the most of every opportunity from winning the championship in the Xfinity Series to making the jump into the Cup Series for us. We look forward to hearing about his plans going forward and know he continues to have a bright future in our sport.\u201d", "Detroit Pistons forward Stanley Johnson (7) reaches for the ball after a dunk by Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade during the second half of an NBA basketball game, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, in Detroit.

The rising costs of drug prices, along with other everyday issues confronting Americans, would be one part of his mission. Another would focus on waste, fraud and abuse in the Trump administration, according to a Democratic aide.\n\nThat could include oversight on topics such Trump\u2019s potential financial conflicts of interest and protecting against violations of the Constitution\u2019s \u201cemoluments clause,\" which prohibits officeholders from accepting payments from foreign governments without consent from Congress. Potential violation examples could include foreign government officials who buy up floors of Trump's hotel rooms or pay higher-than-market rents at Trump Tower, according to committee Democrats.\n\nOther topics could include the handling of security clearances, attacks on government watchdogs and employees, ethics scandals involving senior administration officials and Trump\u2019s immigration and child separation policies at the southern border.\n\nAdam Schiff of California\n\nRep.

A report by the committee\u2019s Democratic staff called \"A Record of Abuse, Corruption, and Inaction,\" blasts the GOP majority for failing to conduct meaningful oversight on a host of issues, including election security, enforcement of federal ethics rules, breaches of the emoluments clause of the Constitution and allegations of obstruction of justice.\n\nHe told The New York Times last month that, if Democrats win control, the committee would open an investigation related to allegations of sexual misconduct and perjury against Justice Brett Kavanaugh, arguing the Senate failed to do its job of \u201cadvise and consent.\" He said the committee would likely subpoena records from the White House and FBI, which conducted an investigation into the allegations that Democrats said wasn't thorough enough.\n\nNadler has also been a critic of Trump\u2019s immigration policies, another topic that falls under the committee\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\"The abuses and ethical lapses we have seen in the Trump Administration, in the Trump Campaign and in Congress clearly show the need to address the culture of corruption that has developed in the absence of appropriate checks on power,\" Nadler said, delivering the weekly Democratic Address last month. \"This corruption is at the heart of what Donald Trump represents: self-interest and ego-driven decisions that come at the expense of the American people.\"\n\nMaxine Waters of California\n\nWaters was among more than a dozen Democrats and high-profile critics of Trump who were targeted last month with suspicious packages carrying bomb-like devices. She blamed Trump for promoting violence among his supporters and urged others to not be intimidated.\n\n\"We have to keep to doing what we\u2019re doing in order to make this country right,\" she said in an interview with Blavity. \"That\u2019s what I intend to do, and as the young people say, 'I ain\u2019t scared.'\"\n\nIf Democrats win the House, Waters would be in line to lead the House Financial Services Committee. That means more power to explore a key interest \u2013 Trump\u2019s finances.\n\nShe has been seeking records that could show whether Trump, his family members and associates have financial ties to Russia.\n\nShe would also be in position to review Republican efforts to roll back Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform protections.\n\n\"Financial services issues are critical for all Americans and for our economy, and I am focused on making sure that our financial system is fair,\" she said in a statement.\n\nWaters, who has long called for Trump\u2019s impeachment, made waves this summer when she encouraged protesters to confront Cabinet officials in public.

Restrictions on female soldiers.\n\nFemale American soldiers and many Afghan women had this in common: The former could not leave their base, on foot or in a vehicle, without being accompanied by a male soldier; the latter often were confined to their homes unless accompanied by a male relative.\n\n4. Engaging with Muslim women.\n\nBegun by the Army in 2004 and adopted by the Marines in 2006, the use of female soldiers to engage with Muslim women had grown by 2011 to consist of 149 FET teams from 14 countries in Afghanistan alone.\n\n5. Increasing roles for women in the military.\n\nThe progress of women in the military has been slow but relentless: In 1901, female nurses became part of the U.S. Army; more than 100,000 women served in World War II; in 1980, the first female West Pointers graduated; in 1989, a woman led a combat unit in action for the first time; in 1993, women were cleared to fly helicopters during combat missions; in 2015 two women graduated from the arduous Ranger School at Fort Benning, Georgia.\n\nCLOSE Put these new books on your wish list right now.

Doesn't really matter. I know they read on Twitter, all that stuff. I guess I don't have to address it. I'm going to address what we need to take care of, is the business at hand. All that doesn't matter if we don't do what we need to.\"\n\nThis will be the 12th time in 14 seasons of ACC divisional play that the Coastal champ has lost at least one league game. There's been a two- or three-league-loss champion of the Coastal five times in that span.\n\nA three-way Coastal tie at 5-3 this season? It's possible if Pitt loses this weekend. Technically, so is a four-way tie at 5-3, but that would require Duke winning out \u2014 and Clemson is one of the three teams left on the Blue Devils' schedule, so that seems unlikely at best. Reigning Coastal champ Miami could still get to 5-3, and if they get into the right tiebreaker the Hurricanes somehow have ways to win the division.\n\nVirginia is taking the week off from ACC play. The Cavaliers play host to Liberty this week in their home finale, and Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall insisted he's not thinking about Coastal permutations.\n\nHe acknowledged that there's a two-game \"fight to the end\" awaiting in the Coastal after this week, and that was as far as he went.\n\n\"Having said that, I really won't address anything other than the Liberty game going forward,\" Mendenhall said. \"That's what I've shared with the team. Now our focus is to play the best football we can this week with that being our only focus.\"\n\nPittsburgh and Virginia are the latest examples of teams that seemed to come from nowhere and announce themselves as serious contenders for a spot in the conference title game.\n\nNeither team got a single Coastal first-place vote out of 148 ballots cast in the ACC preseason poll, and Virginia could be the second team in the last six years to be picked last but end up winning the division. Duke pulled that off in 2013.\n\n\"We haven't done anything yet,\" Narduzzi said. \"We really haven't done anything. We got a long way to go. ... Premature victories are no good. We're not looking for one, either.\"\n\nIf Pitt or Virginia wins the Coastal, it'll mark a sixth different school winning the division in the last six years. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic it's been either Florida State or Clemson as division champ in every season since 2009 \u2014 and the Tigers seem very poised to have that streak reach 10 years and counting.\n\nRicht thinks the Coastal is in a cycle where experience matters, and some years some teams just don't have enough of that.\n\n\"No one has jumped out in regard to out-recruiting, out-developing the other group,\" Richt said. \"That's what we want to become. We want to become that team.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\n'Tis the season to be jolly, because our lord and savior Oprah Winfrey has just released her Favorite Things of 2018. This year, she's bestowed a \"favorite\" tag upon a whopping 107 things\u2014including some budget picks\u2014from the realm of fashion to cooking to home decor and beyond. Though some of her picks this year left us a little cold (like this questionable fur vest) we have some especially choice opinions about the categories we've tested this year.\n\nHere at Reviewed, we take product testing seriously\u2014it's in our name, sure, but it's also in our blood. Each year, we scientifically test hundreds of products in our state-of-the-art labs in Cambridge, Mass. to find the best of the best. That means we can authoritatively say when a product is good\u2014or terrible.\n\nSo we took a good, hard look at Oprah's 2018 recommendations and compared them to our top-rated products to see how they stacked up (don't worry\u2014it's not all bad). This is what we found:\n\nHurom H-AI Platinum Slow Juicer\n\nOprah's Favorite Things 2018 (Photo: Amazon)\n\nOprah's recommendation: Hurom H-AI Platinum Slow Juicer\u2014$700\n\nBuy instead: Omega J8006\u2014$224\n\nNot only is Oprah's favorite juicer a whopping $700, but when we tested the best juicers, a similar Hurom model paled in comparison to our favorite Omega model\u2014the Hurom is less user-friendly, isn't super easy to clean, is harder to assemble, and felt less secure due its smaller base. If you're looking to hop on the juicing bandwagon (or just step your game up), the Omega gives great flavor and yield, with little pulp and a much more palatable pricetag.\n\nBindle Bottle\n\nOprah's Favorite Things 2018 (Photo: Bindle / Reviewed)\n\nOprah's recommendation: Bindle insulated water bottle\u2014$37\n\nBuy instead: Hydro Flask insulated water bottle\u2014$30\n\nYes, the Bindle bottle is cute, what with its little storage compartment at the base to stow your keys, card, and the like. But the best water bottle you can buy is actually the Hydro Flask. It\u2019s portable, versatile, durable, and well designed\u2014and it can keep ice intact for days on end without any melting or condensation thanks to its patented double-wall vacuum. That means you can toss it into your bag and forget about it with nary a leak in sight.\n\nCozy Earth Bamboo Sheets\n\nOprah's Favorite Things 2018 (Photo: Brooklinen / Amazon)\n\nOprah's recommendation: Cozy Earth Bamboo Sheets\u2014$290\n\nBuy instead: Brooklinen Luxe Core Sheet Set\u2014$150\n\nOprah loves these pricey bamboo sheets because \"they're the softest ever and may help regulate body temperature,\" but in our testing, the best bed sheets are actually half the price from Brooklinen. Their weighty sateen feel is wrinkle-resistant, and in our tester's notes, her first comment was, \u201cI\u2019m actually sad I have to take these off my bed.\u201d They'll make crawling into bed a little more luxurious, without putting a huge dent in your wallet.\n\nCourant Catch:3 Wireless Charging Tray\n\nOprah's Favorite Things 2018 (Photo: Courant / Reviewed)\n\nOprah's recommendation: Courant Catch:3 Wireless Charging Tray\u2014$175\n\nBuy instead: Samsung Fast Charge Wireless Charging Pad\u2014$28\n\nOprah's beloved Courant doubles as an expensive accessory tray, but a truly great wireless charging pad should support fast charging and be both affordable, and easy to set up and use without much thought\u2014who wants to set their phone down at night and find it dead in the morning? The Samsung Fast Charge Wireless Charging Pad has a rubberized ring that keeps your smartphone from slip-sliding off and an LED indicator, so you know when it's working (or when it's not).\n\nArtis Elite Mirror Makeup Brush Set\n\nOprah's Favorite Things 2018 (Photo: Amazon / Sephora)\n\nOprah's recommendation: Artis Elite Mirror 10-Piece Makeup Brush Set\u2014$360\n\nBuy instead: Yoseng 10-Piece Makeup Brush Set\u2014$13\n\nOy, Oprah, $360 on a set of brushes? That's the definition of wasting your money on makeup brushes. When we got the scoop from a makeup artist (who, yes, also loved these Artis brushes), she advised us that any brush with natural-fiber bristles and a plastic handle is just as good. Yoseng also makes a set of 10 brushes, but for a fraction of the price, and with the same large, flat surface that allows for easy makeup distribution and even coverage\u2014and 1.5k five-star ratings on Amazon is always a good sign.\n\nFleischer & Wolf Knife Set\n\nOprah's Favorite Things 2018 (Photo: Amazon)\n\nOprah's recommendation: Fleischer & Wolf Portland Ash 8-Piece Knife Set\u2014$220\n\nBuy instead: Mercer Culinary Genesis 6-Piece Forged Knife Block Set\u2014$150\n\nOprah loves this chic magnetic knife set because \"it hardly takes up any space\" and protects hands from sharp blades. Luckily, our best knife set under $200 is the similarly stylish and functional Mercer glass block\u2014and the knives are a dream to slice and dice with. If you want to invest in a higher-quality knife set, check out our favorite knife sets\u2014they're a bit more expensive, but a good knife set lasts forever.\n\nNespresso Lattissima One Espresso Machine\n\nOprah's Favorite Things 2018 (Photo: Nespresso / Reviewed)\n\nOprah's recommendation: Nespresso Lattissima One Espresso Machine\u2014$380\n\nBuy instead: Nespresso Citiz Original Espresso Machine\u2014$170\n\nOprah is right that Nespresso makes the best pod espresso maker on the market, but our favorite model is actually the Citiz. Its narrow design holds 17 cups, but takes up very little counter space and it couldn\u2019t be easier to operate, with two brewing sizes for anything from a double cap to a quick espresso. At Reviewed, we have one in the break room\u2014and I'm completely addicted to its perfect combination of bitter and sweetness.\n\nJulep Ultra-Hydrating Lip Gloss Set\n\nOprah's Favorite Things 2018 (Photo: Amazon / Reviewed)\n\nOprah's recommendation: Julep Divine Shine 12-Piece Ultra-Hydrating Lip Gloss\u2014$150\n\nBuy instead: Wet n Wild Megalast Liquid Catsuit Lipstick\u2014$4\n\nA pack of 12 glosses for $150 is, I suppose, relatively reasonable\u2014until you consider that this ultra-affordable Wet 'n Wild lipstick is the best lipstick you can buy. It's lightweight and smoothing, and it wears for 10 hours without transferring, smudging, drying, or flaking. It also keeps lips hydrated. Plus, think about all the other makeup you can buy with the money you save.\n\nBlack + Decker Helix Hand Mixer\n\nOprah's Favorite Things 2018 (Photo: Amazon)\n\nOprah's recommendation: Black + Decker MX600T Helix Hand Mixer\u2014$30\n\nBuy instead: Cuisinart Power Advantage Plus\u2014$71\n\nWhen we tested the best hand mixers, we did love a moderately-priced, six-speed Black + Decker model, but we still think you're better off with the Cuisinart Power Advantage Plus. It's on the pricey side, but it handles all mixing tasks exceptionally well and is convenient to use\u2014plus, it has a handy storage case to house those beaters that always get lost in your pantry. From whipping cream to kneading bread, you can\u2019t beat the Cuisinart (don't hate me, Oprah).\n\nIzola Reusable Straws\n\nOprah's Favorite Things 2018 (Photo: Amazon)\n\nOprah's recommendation: Izola Reusable Straws\u2014$20 for 4\n\nBuy instead: Hummingbird Glass Straws\u2014$24 for 4\n\nPlastic straws are so pass\u00e9, and Oprah and I both agree that \"friends don\u2019t let friends use plastic straws!\" However, the best reusable straws you can buy aren't her Izola straws, but Hummingbird glass straws. They're a little wider than your average straw, but the glass prevents the straw from getting uncomfortably cold on your mouth as you sip iced coffee or smoothies. They're also super easy to clean, thanks to an included squeegee and the transparent design. We love 'em.\n\nHere's what we do like from Oprah's list\n\nPlease, put your pitchforks down: We didn't disagree with everything on Queen O's list! We, like Oprah, love the following picks: some have even won our coveted best of year awards. These are the products Oprah picked that offer great performance at the intersection of value and usability.\n\nAmazon Echo Spot\n\nOprah's Favorite Things 2018 (Photo: Reviewed)\n\nOprah's (and our!) recommendation: Amazon Echo Spot\u2014$100\n\n\"Good things, meet a small package!\" Girl, yes. We also love the Amazon Echo Spot\u2014it even won our top spot as the best smart home device for apartments. This efficient little guy has all of Alexa\u2019s visual cues and video functionality without taking up much room. Its screen is small but super useful with a sleek design makes that looks just as at home on a bedside table as it does on a kitchen counter.\n\nApple Airpods\n\nOprah's Favorite Things 2018 (Photo: Reviewed)\n\nOprah's (and our!) recommendation: Apple Airpods\u2014$160\n\nAs O says, \"To live your best life is to live a cord-free life,\" and we wholeheartedly agree when it comes Airpods\u2014even our resident cynic hates to love them. They're hands-down the best wireless earbuds you can buy because they're simple to use, convenient, and offer much better sound than even their wired counterparts.\n\nClarisonic Mia\n\nOprah's Favorite Things 2018 (Photo: Reviewed / Clarisonic)\n\nOprah's (and our!) recommendation: Clarisonic Mia Smart\u2014$250\n\nWhen we tested the best facial cleansing brushes, we said that \"There\u2019s a reason why Clarisonic is a top-of-mind brand for facial cleansing devices: Nothing else even comes close to the Mia 2. It's pricey, but you absolutely get what you pay for.\" Oprah's pick, the Mia Smart, is the cooler older sister of the Mia 2. It has an extra cleansing setting and extended battery life, and it connects to the app for custom skincare routines and gently transitions your skin to sonic cleansing over the first weeks of use.\n\nPrices are accurate at the time of publication, but may change over time.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2018/11/07/we-tested-oprahs-favorite-things-of-2018heres-what-you-shouldnt-buy/38430853/", "", "Pile of durian fruits on a Malaysian market, one is cut open to see the fruity inside (Photo: BeeBright, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nAn Indonesian flight was delayed after passengers complained about a strong, foul smell in the cabin caused by a fruit, according to BBC News and The Jakarta Post.\n\nDurian is a large, spiky fruit popular in Asia that gives off an overwhelming odor, earning it the nickname of world's smelliest fruit.\n\nJust over 2 tons of the controversial fruit was being stowed in the cargo hold of the Sriwijaya Air flight, which was traveling from Bengkulu to Jakarta, the news sites report.\n\nThe airline eventually listened to passengers' complaints and removed the fruit from the plane.

(Photo: STEPHEN BRASHEAR, AP)\n\nBoeing has issued a safety bulletin to all airlines that operate the Boeing 737 Max aircraft, and the Federal Aviation Administration is expected to follow with an Airworthiness Directive mandating safety protocols for U.S. carriers.\n\nThe moves by Boeing and the FAA follow the Oct. 29 crash of a 2-month-old Lion Air Boeing 737 Max jet that killed all 189 onboard when the plane plunged into the sea shortly after taking off from Jakarta, Indonesia.\n\nSafety regulators of other nations typically follow directives issued by the FAA.\n\nThe focus in the crash investigation appears to have turned to the flight data sensor and the possibility it returned erroneous readings.\n\nTwo U.S. airlines fly the Boeing 737 Max 8. Southwest has 26 while American Airlines has 16. Combined, the airlines have hundreds more on order.\n\nUnited Airlines flies another variant, the 737 Max 9, which also is covered by Boeing's bulletin. None of those U.S. airlines have reported the issue covered by Boeing\u2019s bulletin regarding its 737 Max aircraft.\n\nBloomberg News was the first to report that the FAA planned to issue an airworthiness directive for the 737 Max. Bloomberg wrote that \u201cunder some circumstances, such as when pilots are flying manually, the Max jets will automatically try to push down the nose if they detect that an aerodynamic stall is possible.\u201d\n\nIt's the sensor readings that are thought to incorrectly show that such a stall is possible.\n\nA Boeing statement said that its safety bulletin, sent to airlines on Tuesday, directs flight crews to \u201cexisting flight crew procedure\u201d on how they should respond to erroneous data for the sensor which monitors an aircraft\u2019s \"angle of attack,\" a vital measurement in determining lift after takeoff.\n\nAerospace industry expert Jon Ostrower writes via his blog The Air Current that \u201cthe erroneous (angle of attack) input can pitch the aircraft\u2019s stabilizer trim down for up to 10 seconds at a time.\u201d\n\nBoeing\u2019s bulletin is said to include instructions to pilots on how to compensate for automated controls that may be triggered by incorrect sensor readings.\n\nAfter Boeing\u2019s update, the FAA followed on Wednesday with a statement that, according to Bloomberg, it plans to issue an airworthiness directive on the issue and \u201cwill take further appropriate actions depending on the results of the investigation.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, also citing unnamed \u201cpeople familiar with the matter,\u201d writes \u201cthe moves are the first public indication that investigators suspect a possible software glitch or misinterpretation by pilots \u2013 related to an essential system that measures how high or low a plane\u2019s nose is pointed \u2013 may have played an important part in the sequence of events that caused the Boeing 737 Max 8 to plunge into the Java Sea.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoeing and the FAA are providing operators with information and a reminder of how to address a stabilizer trim nose down condition,\u201d says John Cox, aviation expert and USA TODAY\u2019s Ask the Captain author. \u201cThere are several steps a crew can take, but in the end they switch the electric stabilizer trim off and revert to manual trim.\"\n\n\u201cStabilizer trim\u201d refers to flight controls addressing the pitch of the airplane, according to Cox.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear if Boeing planned an further update to its Tuesday bulletin, but comments made to The Associated Press indicated they expected one.\n\nFor now, that leaves airlines to ensure that they\u2019re following the latest updates.\n\nBoeing has delivered more than 200 models of the aircraft and has received orders for more than 4,500 of its 737 Max models.\n\nMore: Lion Air crash: Southwest, American use the same new Boeing plane in Indonesia crash\n\nFor now, though, industry analysts played down the possible impact on U.S. airlines and travelers.\n\n\"No impact at all so far,\" Richard Aboulafia, a vice president at Teal Group who analyzes commercial aviation, told USA TODAY. \"There's a working hypothesis, and a caution to watch crew procedure in the event that this problem repeats. If the hypothesis is correct, there could, conceivably, be minor equipment modifications and a renewed emphasis on crew procedure.\"\n\nHe added, \"there is nothing, so far, that indicates a serious problem for airlines and nothing that would impact the safest form of transportation ever created.\"\n\nAnother industry Henry Harteveldt, co-founder of the Atmosphere Research Group travel consultancy, echoed those sentiments.\n\nHe said it\u2019s too early make conclusions until the FAA actually issues its directive on the subject.\n\nHe points out the agency regularly issues directives. While some are for serious items, many address relatively minor issues.\n\n\u201cRight now, based on what information is available, it appears this will be a fairly unobtrusive type of directive in terms of affecting airline operations,\u201d Harteveldt said. \u201cI\u2019m not expecting aircraft to be grounded.

Duncan Hunter of California and Chris Collins of New York \u2013 despite the fact that both face criminal charges.\n\nHunter easily defeated Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar despite facing a 60-count indictment claiming that he and his wife, Margaret, who also was charged, used his campaign account as a personal slush fund to finance an extravagant lifestyle.\n\nThe Hunters were indicted in August and Duncan Hunter claimed then that the charges were politically motivated and he compared himself to President Donald Trump as another Republican being mistreated by the Justice Department.\n\nHe won in a solidly Republican suburban San Diego district that Trump won by 15 percentage points in 2016.\n\nCollins was indicted in August on charges of insider trading. While serving on the board of directors of a drug company, he is accused of tipping off others that a key drug the company was developing had failed in testing.\n\nCollins represents a western New York district that Trump won by 24 percentage points.

It also sets him up for a showdown against the Cowboys in Dallas on a Thursday night game on Nov. 29.\n\nBryant, 30, worked out for the Saints on Tuesday.

(AP Photo/Andre Penner) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Five-time Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton has a two-step plan for keeping the new generation of talented drivers behind him next season: match their youthful hunger and outwit them with the experience that comes with age.\n\nThe 33-year-old Hamilton wrapped up this year's title at the Mexican Grand Prix two weeks ago and is already looking forward to the renewed challenge he will face in 2019 from a crop of young drivers who will only get better.\n\nHamilton, who became the youngest F1 champion when he won his first title at the age of 23 in 2008, says he sees a bit of himself in 21-year-old Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc and Red Bull's 22-year-old Pierre Gasly.\n\n\"These are two young rising stars that are already showing incredible potential,\" Hamilton said after he arrived in Sao Paulo for this weekend's Brazilian Grand Prix.\n\nHe later added 21-year-old Red Bull driver Max Verstappen to the shortlist as well.\n\n\"I welcome the competition,\" he said. \"Naturally I do see a little bit of myself in them. At their age I had the same kind of eye of the tiger. Now it is a little different for me, I am one of the older drivers. But I feel like I still have that hunger they are coming in with.\"\n\nHamilton also has the experience of spending a decade at the pinnacle of the sport, and he thinks that could help him stay at the top for a bit longer.\n\n\"Perhaps there are things that I will be able to bring to the table and that they won't,\" he said.\n\nInterlagos will host the penultimate race of the F1 season this weekend. Hamilton called the Brazilian track \"one of the trickiest of the season\" and \"an Achilles heel.\"\n\nHamilton won the Brazilian race in 2016 and lifted his first F1 title in Sao Paulo 10 years ago, finishing fourth after a dramatic overtake on the last lap.\n\n\"The first year here was quite difficult, but it has been improving over time,\" he said.\n\nWhile Hamilton has already clinched the individual title, his Mercedes team is still fighting with Ferrari for the constructor's championship \u2014 meaning the Briton will not be able to relax just yet.\n\n\"We still have two races to go and a championship at stake,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

In order to do so, we\u2019ve tasked our resident Challenge expert Charles Curtis with power ranking the remaining teams based on the latest episode \u2026\n\n1. BANANAS AND TONY\n\nAnyone who has EVER had any doubt who the GOAT of The Challenge is (I will not name my colleague who picked CT over him), how do you feel now? The pair come back from the redemption house and get the matchup we\u2019ve all been waiting for: A physical Armageddon pitting them against Shane and Nelson. And who won with an emphatic sweep? These two.\n\nProps to Tony, too, who has looked bigger and more focused than he has in previous seasons. Now the game goes back into their hands, and all Bananas has to do is figure out this endgame. I don\u2019t doubt he will.\n\n2. JOSS AND SYLVIA\n\nBetween winning the \u201cRolling Thunder\u201d challenge and that stacking elimination that sent Bananas and Tony to the redemption house, these two are operating at a high level and combine brains and muscle.

ASHLEY AND HUNTER\n\nThe Lavender Ladies? Mostly donezo. Team Young Buck? Destroyed. They\u2019re only this high up because Ashley and Sylvia are an alliance, and we know what this pair is capable of if they can get it together before a final.\n\n4. NATALIE AND PAULIE\n\nA total wild card! They\u2019ve proven to be survivors and tough competitors, but they\u2019ve got to figure out who to ally with \u2014 the last Lavender Ladies? Or should she choose her old pal Johnny Bananas and \u2026\n\n5. CARA MARIA AND MARIE\n\nThey\u2019re probably the choice for elimination by the group that\u2019s left. Joss and Sylvia would vote for them (their vote counts twice), which probably leaves Ashley and Hunter the volunteers to go into an elimination against them. That decision alone should ramp up the drama next week. That said, do Cara Maria and Bananas figure out a way to foil that plan? It\u2019s going to take convincing Natalie and Paulie to come aboard \u2026 but it appears from next week\u2019s preview, Cara Maria and Paulie, er, worked something out.\n\nThe last challenge before The Final is going to be SHOCKING \u26a1\ufe0f Don't miss it, next Tuesday at 9/8c! \ud83d\udc40 #TheChallenge32 pic.twitter.com/ME2x4onXTC \u2014 The Challenge (@ChallengeMTV) November 7, 2018\n\nHonorable mention: KAM AND KAYLEIGH\n\nNormally, I don\u2019t list eliminated competitors in this weekly take on the MTV series. But I\u2019ve got to take a moment to applaud for these two. Kayleigh shrugged off Bananas stirring up relationship drama between her and Nelson and Kam brilliantly did math BEFORE Kayleigh went up the wall in the \u201cI Got You Pegged\u201d Armageddon to beat Kyle and Brad.\n\nI\u2019m going to turn into T.J.

Infantino has asked the emir of Qatar to consider co-hosting the next World Cup with several nations that are attempting to isolate the tiny desert country in a bitter diplomatic dispute. Qatar has just eight stadiums to host 64 games over an already-congested 28-day window in 2022. Expanding the field to 48 teams would mean 80 games, requiring more stadiums. Infantino says using venues in Saudi Arabia and around the Persian Gulf \u201cwould probably be a nice message.\u201d (AP Photo/Martin Ruggiero, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nZURICH (AP) \u2014 The 2022 World Cup must be played in just 28 days even if it is expanded to 48 teams, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said Wednesday, acknowledging that the tight schedule will make it even harder to push through his preferred vision of a bigger tournament.\n\nFIFA will decide in March whether to add 16 teams to its showcase tournament in 2022, but Infantino said the chances of an expansion are \"certainly small\" because of the scheduling issues \u2014 and the fact that host Qatar would need help from some neighboring countries to stage some games.\n\nA 48-team World Cup would entail playing 80 games in total, meaning up to six matches would have to be played on some days during the group stages to fit the 28-day window. Some knockout matches would also have to be played simultaneously.\n\nFIFA have had to shorten the tournament by four days compared to this year's World Cup in Russia because it will be played in November and December in order to avoid desert heat. European leagues, who are set to lose peak weeks from their 2022-23 season, insist they cannot compromise again by giving FIFA more days from their November schedule.\n\n\"We cannot make (the tournament) longer,\" Infantino told reporters at FIFA headquarters. \"It is not ideal, that would entail to have (World Cup) matches simultaneously.\"\n\nThe 2026 World Cup in North America will feature 48 teams and a 34-day schedule. Infantino would like to move to the bigger format right away, but diplomatic challenges also count against expanding the tournament in 2022.\n\nQatar is preparing to build eight stadiums and host 32 teams, so would need to let neighboring countries stage games.\n\nInfantino said last month he asked the emir of Qatar if he would consider allowing games to be held elsewhere. However, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have all been part of an economic and travel boycott against Qatar for the past 18 months.\n\n\"In light of the current circumstances in the region that we all know, well, I would be even happier if this could happen,\" Infantino said of the 48-team proposal. \"What are the chances? Small, certainly small. (But) what is wrong with trying, discussing, debating?\"\n\nFIFA believes a bigger World Cup would be justified by the extra exposure in the 16 countries where additional qualifying places would fast-track soccer's development.\n\n\"If we can increase the number of teams this is good for football generally,\" Infantino said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He had been under mounting pressure ahead of the game, with one British newspaper having reported he would be fired whatever the result, and United had fallen behind 2-0 after 10 minutes.\n\nIt was argued by Mourinho that his words \"were a personal, inwardly-directed expression of relief, happiness and determination,\" the commission said, and that they \"were entirely inaudible (and) were directed to no one.\"\n\nThe three-man panel accepted those arguments, adding that \"a typical person fluent in Portuguese colloquialisms would not feel insulted or offended from what they saw or interpreted from the footage, rather would understand (Mourinho) to be very happy about something good that had just happened to him against all odds.\"\n\nThe written reasons for the commission's decision were published Wednesday.\n\nThe appeal hearing should take place during the upcoming two-week international break, which begins after United's derby against Manchester City on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Chuck Burton) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Dave Doeren doesn't necessarily need to remind his North Carolina State players of the way they fumbled away last year's loss at Wake Forest.\n\n\"Probably not,\" Doeren quipped, \"but I will.\"\n\nThe 22nd-ranked Wolfpack play host to the Demon Deacons on Thursday night with fresh memories of that miscue-marked loss in the last meeting of their instate rivalry.\n\nN.C. State was driving for the go-ahead touchdown in the final minutes when receiver Emeka Emezie caught a pass from Ryan Finley and fumbled inches short of the goal line . Wake Forest recovered in the end zone for a touchback with 1:51 to play. Finley also threw an interception on his final, last-gasp deep pass with a second left.\n\nThe Wolfpack (6-2, 3-2 ACC, No. 14 CFP) have been pretty tough to beat ever since.\n\nThey won their last two games of 2017, then opened this season with a five-game winning streak, and the only teams to defeat them are presently in the top 15 \u2014 No. 2 Clemson and No. 13 Syracuse.\n\nThey're coming off a 47-28 rout of Florida State in which they raced out to a 17-0 lead and never let up. That snapped a two-game losing streak that briefly knocked them out of the national rankings.\n\n\"We need to be us,\" Doeren said. \"We need to go play. We need to play the way we played Saturday. . We just played good, tough fundamental football.\"\n\nIt's been tough for the Demon Deacons (4-5, 1-4) to find any measure of consistency during a season in which they've lost 12 players to season-ending injuries \u2014 the most significant, and most recent, of which is freshman quarterback Sam Hartman, who's out with a leg injury suffered in last week's loss to Syracuse .\n\nCoach Dave Clawson sees improvement, saying \"very subtlely, we are getting better\" because the defensive players' alignment has improved.\n\n\"The challenge is going to be to go in there with a brand new starting quarterback in week 10 in a very hostile environment,\" Clawson said.\n\nQB QUESTIONS\n\nClawson is turning things over to redshirt sophomore Jamie Newman , who has played in three games over two seasons and has yet to throw a touchdown pass. Kendall Hinton, the presumptive starter in the spring before his three-game suspension opened the door for Hartman to claim the job, is listed as the backup. \"Jamie's the starter,\" Clawson said, \"and it's his game.\"\n\nRUNNING WOLFPACK\n\nN.C. State seems to have figured out its ground game. The Wolfpack's 177 yards rushing against Florida State marked their second-most productive performance of the season. It helps that freshman Ricky Person Jr. is healthy enough to form a strong one-two punch with Reggie Gallaspy. Person scored the first three touchdowns of his season \u2014 two rushing, one receiving \u2014 against the Seminoles. \"Him and Reggie in combination with each other, I think, is really good for our run game,\" Doeren said.\n\nWAKE VS. TOP 25\n\nThe Demon Deacons are 0-3 against ranked teams this season, losing to Clemson, Syracuse and No. 3 Notre Dame by a combined score of 160-54. Their three FBS wins have come against teams that are a combined 7-21.\n\nTHE SERIES\n\nN.C. State has won 15 of the last 16 home games against the opponent it's played most frequently over the years. The Demon Deacons' only victory in Raleigh in that span came in 2006 during their run to an unlikely ACC title and an Orange Bowl appearance.\n\nSIDELIGHTS\n\nThe Wolfpack are celebrating their Senior Night as originally scheduled even though they have one more home game \u2014 East Carolina visits Dec. 1 in a replacement game for the West Virginia game that was canceled in September due to Hurricane Florence. And consensus All-American Bradley Chubb, the No. 5 overall pick by the Denver Broncos, is having his No. 9 jersey honored along the stadium's fa\u00e7ade.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch shows new sides of the infamous green character in \"The Grinch.\" (Photo: ROBERT DEUTSCH/USA TODAY)\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch is mean, green and ready to joyfully snarl through the holidays in \"The Grinch.\"\n\nThe English actor, 42, has played cantankerous genius types, from Marvel's Doctor Strange to Sherlock Holmes. But Cumberbatch knew he was stepping up that game revisiting the conniving Grinch from Theodor Seuss Geisel's (aka Dr. Seuss) children's book and the classic Chuck Jones 1966 TV special \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\"\n\n\"That\u2019s the joy: Vicariously or not, you get a thrill out of some of his meanness,\" says Cumberbatch, speaking by phone from New York, where the animated movie premiered last week with an avocado-green carpet. But there's Grinch love, too, in the new version (in theaters Friday). USA TODAY spoke to a surprisingly joyful Cumberbatch about donning Christmas sweaters, driving like a Grinch and what makes him crazy during the holidays.\n\nQuestion: Sensitive actors would hate that call saying, \"You're the perfect Grinch!\" How did that go down?\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch: I have my moments. But, I thought, \"Christ, it\u2019s a bit early for being called out as a Grinch, isn\u2019t it?\" One of my first questions, in all seriousness was, why me? They said, \"We love your voice.\" So I gave them a Grinch voice, quite animal-y with an American dialect. They went, \"No, we\u2019d like your voice.\" Then I got it. They saw a correlation between casting Benedict Cumberbatch as the Grinch. They saw Sherlock, and outsiders, somewhat socially awkward, who can be occasionally rude. I said, \"I might not be the right guy.\" I had to stick to my guns: \"You cannot release a film with an English Grinch. It\u2019s got to be an American.\"\n\nMore: Benedict Cumberbatch is a mean one in 'The Grinch'\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch can relate to the Grinch's Christmas mood: He's worked in retail at the holidays. (Photo: ILLUMINATION/UNIVERSAL PICTURES)\n\nQ: Is your argument undermined by the fact that English actor Boris Karloff voiced the Grinch in the original TV special with a British accent?\n\nCumberbatch: Did he? I haven\u2019t seen the original. I loved the book but haven\u2019t seen either of the other versions (the TV special or the 2000 Jim Carrey movie). I\u2019m looking forward to seeing both now that I\u2019m free of them influencing what I was doing. But there is something classically American in the rhyming scheme that lends itself much more to an American accent.\n\nQ: Do people understand that the Grinch ethos is laudable in some areas, such as his stance against Christmas commercialism?\n\nCumberbatch: He\u2019s proven right and wrong. But when you start stealing toys from kids, it doesn\u2019t go down so well. That\u2019s a pretty hard sell at Christmas.\n\nThe original Grinch from the 1966 TV special \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\" (Photo: ABC)\n\nQ: Does the Grinch offer freedom to be grumpy over the holidays?\n\nCumberbatch: There are certain things that are going to grind you down. I\u2019ve worked in a shop over the Christmas season, with the holiday track repeating. It drives you insane. And your Christmas spirit gets really, really tested. I\u2019m not as high on Christmas as the Whos of Whoville. But I\u2019m not as Grinchy about it as the Grinch. I\u2019m somewhere in a happy English, cynical, medium place about the whole thing.\n\nQ: What holiday aspect brings out your Grinch?\n\nCumberbatch: Definitely plastic winds me up at Christmas with the amount of waste and short-term joy. Beyond that, I\u2019m human behind the wheel. Everyone can get lost within their world and feel like they are driving on Mount Crumpit and the world is at fault. I can get Grinchy in a car. I get quite Grinchy when I\u2019m hangry or jet-lagged. That happens. But I don\u2019t have too much to get Grinchy about, honestly. And I love Christmas for the reasons this film celebrates.\n\nThe Grinch (Benedict Cumberbatch) plays the organ with a little help from his dog Max on drums in \"The Grinch.\" (Photo: ILLUMINATION/UNIVERSAL PICTURES)\n\nQ: Did you ever pull the Grinch card, get grumpy while recording and say it was for character reasons?\n\nCumberbatch: I prepped for this by getting very Grinchy about doing another recording session, saying the same line 500 times. That\u2019s enough to put you in the Grinch spirit. But it was always a joy going into the Soho recording studio. There would be a healthy breakfast shot of something green-looking with a bit of ginger. I\u2019d have one to get my green on, go downstairs with a smile on my face and then get cracking.\n\nQ: Christmas is a great time for villains. Who's your favorite?\n\nCumberbatch: Hans Gruber in \u201cDie Hard.\u201d It is a Christmas film in my book.\n\nQ: Christmas controversy! Others?\n\nCumberbatch: Bill Murray in \"Scrooged.\" A wonderful anti-hero rather than a villain. That\u2019s one I can watch every time it\u2019s on with one of my favorite movie closing numbers, \"Put A Little Love In Your Heart.\" Great song.\n\nQ: Would you play Scrooge?\n\nCumberbatch: I\u2019ve been offered in the past. I shouldn\u2019t talk about offers. Maybe. It\u2019s a story that\u2019s been told a lot. Superlatively.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch points out that this Grinch is more sensitive than previous versions. \"I don\u2019t believe in good and evil.

Gaines was also hurt, sustaining his second concussion in three weeks. (AP Photo/David Richard, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBEREA, Ohio (AP) \u2014 The losses are piling up for the Browns \u2014 in the standings, and on the sideline.\n\nOn Wednesday, two defensive starters were added to the stack.\n\nCleveland placed linebacker Christian Kirksey and cornerback E.J. Gaines on injured reserve, ending their seasons with seven games remaining and putting further strain on a unit lacking quality depth and experience.\n\n\"Those two guys, they really set a precedent for what we wanted to do as a team, as a defense,\" said cornerback T.J. Carrie. \"And, of course, they'll still be here sparingly in and out throughout the week, but it's a lot different when they were on the field fighting with you, blood, sweat and tears with you, through the trenches.\n\n\"We're going to definitely miss that. Those are two players that we can't replace.\"\n\nOne of the team's captains, Kirksey injured his left hamstring in the second quarter Sunday as the Browns (2-6-1) lost their fourth straight game, 37-21 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nGaines sustained his second concussion in three weeks when he took a knee to the helmet while trying to make a tackle in the first quarter.\n\nThe loss of Kirksey is especially damaging because he's one of the team's leaders. The fifth-year pro has played on the weak side and in the middle this season, making 43 tackles and two interceptions.\n\n\"Kirko is kind of the heart and soul of the defense, heart and soul of the team in the locker room, on the field, just how he goes about his business,\" said linebacker Joe Schobert, a 2017 Pro Bowler who returned to practice after missing three games with a hamstring injury. \"It's the next-man-up mentality, but there's things that you're going to miss.\"\n\nSchobert's return will help ease the loss of Kirksey, and the Browns are expected to have defensive back Damarious Randall for Sunday's game against Atlanta after he missed last week's game with a groin injury.\n\nLinebacker Jamie Collins (ankle) and rookie cornerback Denzel Ward (hip) were limited in practice, but interim coach Gregg Williams expects both back on the field Thursday.\n\nRandall, who has played cornerback and free safety, felt he was healthy enough to play last week, but Williams kept him out so he would have the versatile defensive back for multiple games. Randall's absence became magnified when Ward and Gaines went down on the Chiefs' opening drive, forcing Williams to adjust his game plan against the NFL's most electrifying offense and play seldom-used reserves Denzel Rice and Tavierre Thomas.\n\n\"It's very hard,\" Carrie said of losing two key players. \"It changes the game plan. It changes a lot of things because you can only give practice reps to so many guys, and so you get guys that come in and they're athletes, but it's hard when you don't know the schematics of the little details that we put in for that game.\"\n\nAnd, as luck would have it, the banged-up Browns will have to deal with a talented Atlanta team that has overcome its own injury issues and reeled off three straight wins.\n\nNeeding seasoned secondary help, the Browns claimed Phillip Gaines off waivers from Buffalo and Jermaine Whitehead from Green Bay. To make roster room, Rice was waived.\n\nGaines spent four years with Kansas City before signing with Buffalo. Whitehead played in 19 games with the Packers from 2016-18.\n\nSchobert's return is vital to Cleveland's defense as he's the one responsible for calling out Williams' pre-snap schemes and getting his teammates organized \u2014 an on-field coach.\n\nAfter missing three weeks, getting back on the field will be a welcomed change for Schobert, who had played every defensive snap since the start of the 2017 season until he got hurt on Oct. 21 at Tampa Bay.\n\n\"It is just different. It is weird,\" Schobert said of being inactive. \"Especially with a hamstring. You just walk around on the sideline feeling good and watching people on the field thinking you can be out there \u2014 wishing you could be out there. You just have to kind of suck it up and take it into your own role however you can help a team in that aspect.\n\n\"That is what I was doing. Just kind of jumped right into more of a coaching aspect, trying to keep myself involved that way. I think it helped.\"\n\nNOTES: Rookie LT Desmond Harrison was limited in practice after missing last week's game with an undisclosed illness. Greg Robinson stepped in and played well in his first start for Cleveland. Williams hasn't decided who he'll play against the Falcons. \"What we will do is every day is an interview and both of them are taking reps,\" he said. \"By the end of the week, we will make what is best and it is good \u2014 the fact that you have depth. Guys can compete and get ready to roll.\" ... The Browns signed DB Juston Burris to the active roster off the Jets' practice squad.

You don't keep one foot in and one foot out,\" FIFA deputy secretary general Alasdair Bell said. \"That would be the general approach we would follow, but of course lawyers can debate this for a long time.\"\n\nBoth Infantino and Bell were long-time staffers at UEFA, which has steadily changed Champions League prize money and entry rules to favor top clubs and stall breakaway threats.\n\n\"This is the history of the last 20 years,\" said Infantino, who has clashed this year with European soccer officials and club leaders over FIFA's proposed Club World Cup project, which is funded by Japanese investor SoftBank.\n\nInfantino said his plan \u2014 potentially featuring 12 European clubs in a 24-team lineup, and worth a promised $3 billion every four years \u2014 could head off a private closed league.\n\n\"The Club World Cup is the answer to any attempt to think even about any sort of breakaway leagues,\" he said.\n\nInfantino insisted while the plan would be lucrative for clubs taking part, it also kept money in the soccer family. FIFA would use 25 percent of revenue to share globally.\n\n\"If the price to pay is to give proper revenues to a club participating in a Club World Cup but this allows us to ... give $1 million to Haiti who has nothing, or to Mongolia who has three time zones but only two football pitches, well then we should be I think doing that,\" he said.\n\nA FIFA task force will assess a revamp of competitions, including a new event for all national teams played every two years. A decision is expected in March when Infantino chairs a FIFA Council meeting in Miami.\n\nHe also believes the latest threat will calm.\n\n\"People are still quite reasonable,\" Infantino said. \"I trust certainly the club owners and presidents to be able to have a discussion.\"\n\nAlso Wednesday, Infantino addressed the \"Football Leaks\" documents that showed him being pressured by wealthy clubs during his time as UEFA's top administrator to ensure they avoided a Champions League ban for breaking \"Financial Fair Play\" rules designed to curb overspending.\n\nSome critics suggested Infantino overreached his duty when independent panels were investigating and judging clubs such as Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain.\n\n\"We were doing our job and saved the system, and we saved European club football,\" Infantino said.\n\nIn further \"Football Leaks\" fallout, Infantino said it was unfair that a childhood friend, Rinaldo Arnold, was under scrutiny. A special counsel is assessing if Arnold's work as a regional prosecutor in Switzerland is in conflict with private invitations to games from Infantino and their professional contacts.\n\n\"I think there are much more serious issues that can be looked at,\" the FIFA president said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Votes are still being counted from Tuesday's election but a picture of the 2020 campaign is coming into focus.\n\nRepublicans not only emerged with their majority intact but expanded it by at least two seats. That cushion will make it harder for Democrats to retake the chamber two years from now.\n\nUnlike 2018, 2020 is a presidential election year in which Donald Trump will be on the ballot as he seeks a second term. Voter sentiment about the president will play a big role in determining who turns out to the polls and which party they support.\n\nHere are six takeaways from the Senate races:\n\nThe Trump effect key for Senate races in 2020\n\nNot only did Republicans keep the Senate, they outperformed many pollsters' expectations in that chamber by trouncing Democratic incumbents in conservative states such as Missouri, North Dakota and Indiana.\n\nThe president immersed himself in campaigning for GOP Senate candidates in the final weeks of the midterm races. He and his aides view the Senate results as a vindication of the president's power as a political force, even as Republicans lost their majority in the House.\n\nTrump's popularity with the conservative base could present daunting obstacles for Democrats trying to make inroads in red states in the 2020 Senate contests.\n\nMore: Elections 2018 US Senate race results\n\nRe-emergence of the Blue Wall?\n\nOn the flip side, Tuesday's election underscored the challenges Trump and his allies could face swing states two years from now.\n\nTrump won the presidency two years ago by squeaking out victories in the industrial Midwest in four states Barack Obama had captured twice: Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nVoters in all of those states opted to re-elect Democratic Senate incumbents Tuesday. In addition, three of those states chose Democrats for governor. The exception was Ohio where Republican Mike DeWine defeated Democrat Richard Cordray.\n\nJim Messina, a Democratic strategist who managed President Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign, said Tuesday's election results show that Trump triumph's in the upper Midwest in 2016 was an aberration that won't be replicated in 2020. Lingering voter dissatisfaction with the president and his agenda remains strong, he said on CNN\n\n\"The blue wall is going to be real in 2020,\" Messina said.\n\nMap for GOP challenging but not that bad\n\nOf the 33 seats up for election, 20 are Republican. A 21st \u2014 Mississippi \u2014 will be decided by a runoff election still up for grabs in the 2018 election.\n\nOf those, only three appear to be Democratic pickup opportunities: Colorado, Iowa, and Maine. A fourth, North Carolina, could be in play given that Republican Tom Tillis is likely running for re-election to a seat Democrat Kay Hagan won in 2008.\n\nConversely, the GOP could flip three of the 12 Democratic seats up for election: Alabama, Michigan and New Hampshire.\n\nWith Republicans adding to their margin Tuesday, it makes it more likely the GOP will hold the Senate beyond 2020 as well.\n\nWill older Republican incumbents run again?\n\nA third of the GOP senators up for re-election two years from now will be 70 or older in 2020. That list comprises David Perdue of Georgia, James Risch of Idaho, Pat Roberts of Kansas, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, and Michael Enzi of Wyoming.\n\nMcConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, is so far the only one of that group to announce he's running for reelection. He'a already been assembling a campaign staff.\n\nGiven that it's usually more difficult to defend an open seat, expect lots of pressure on those as-yet-uncommitted GOP senators to run again. One who's likely to seek re-election is Sen. Jim Inhofe, who turns 84 next week, now that he's become chairman of the Armed Services Committee following Arizona GOP Sen.

But if it's someone who does not carry the political baggage Moore did, the GOP will be heavily favored to retake the seat.\n\nAiding Republican chances of retaking the seat is that Trump will be on the ballot.

(Photo: Eric Gay, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 While many races have yet to be called, it is clear after Tuesday's election that the predicted \"blue wave\" in the 2018 midterms turned out to be more of a Democratic swell.\n\nDemocrats did gain a clear majority in the House and flipped some governorships (although fewer than they had hoped), but Republicans added more seats than expected in the Senate and scored victories in nearly all of the most high-profile races.\n\nBoth sides are claiming the results as a victory. So who really came out on top?\n\nHere is a look at the winners and losers from Tuesday:\n\nLoser: Liberal Democrats\n\nBefore Tuesday, liberal-leaning commentators gushed about three Democratic candidates who appeared to be winning over voters in Southern states with unapologetically liberal platforms: Beto O'Rourke in the Texas Senate race, Andrew Gillum in the Florida governor race and Stacey Abrams in the Georgia governor race.\n\nTheir campaigns became the focus of national media attention heading into the election and Democrats poured money into the races. Many said those three candidates could represent a new forward for liberals in Republican territory.\n\nAbrams, Gillum and O'Rourke performed well and made their races tight, but all three appear to have been defeated.\n\nOn the other hand, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist, won in deeply blue New York to become the youngest woman ever elected to Congress at age 29.\n\nMore: Elections 2018 results from every state\n\nWinner: Sen. Mitch McConnell\n\nHeading into Election Day, most pollsters and pundits predicted that Republicans would retain control of the Senate, but few thought they would add more than one, maybe two seats. Some said a true Democratic wave could even sweep away a couple of GOP incumbents to hand Democrats a majority.\n\nBut the Republicans did much more than hold onto the Senate, they flipped at least three Senate seats, defeating Democratic incumbent Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Donnelly and Claire McCaskill. And they may not be done there. Florida Gov. Rick Scott led Sen. Bill Nelson (although a mandatory recount could be triggered if the current margin holds).\n\nMore: Arizona's McSally-Sinema Senate race is too close to call. Now what happens?\n\nNevada's incumbent Sen. Dean Heller was defeated and Krysten Sinema took a late lead in Arizona's Senate race, cutting into GOP gains. But however the undeclared races shake out, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can rest easy. At a minimum, he will have a 52-48 majority, assuming Democrats don't pull off a major upset in Mississippi's Senate runoff later this month.\n\nIf Scott goes on to victory, the Republicans win in Mississippi and Sinema holds her lead, that margin will widen to 53-47, a net gain of two seats.\n\nMore: Republicans make history by growing Senate majority while losing House\n\nWinner: House Democrats\n\nPerhaps the biggest outcome of the election: divided government has returned to Capitol Hill. The winners of more than 20 House races have not yet been projected, but Democrats have already won more than the 218 seats required to gain a majority and they are expected to pad their lead as the remaining races are called.\n\nHouse Democrats' will now have to decide if Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., will return to her role as speaker. More than two dozen Democratic House candidates ran on pledges not to support Pelosi \u2013 who has become a lightning rod for conservatives \u2013 if they won.\n\nMore: Democrats seize control of House, power to investigate President Trump\n\nLoser: Donald Trump\n\nWith Democrats in control of the House, the barks of opposition that have hounded Trump since he took office will now have some bite.\n\nDemocrats are all but certain to use their new authority to launch investigations the current Republican leadership didn't wish to pursue. And the president may very well see a subpoena for those tax returns he has been reluctant to share. Pelosi made it clear Tuesday that she opposes impeachment, but that doesn't mean the liberal wing of the party won't be pushing for it.\n\nWinner: Donald Trump\n\nHe might have lost the House, but the president was celebrating on his Twitter feed Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. That's because of the Republicans' strong performance in several Senate races that polls had painted as Democratic-leaning toss-ups.\n\nTrump has always thrilled at besting his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, and on Tuesday Republicans were victorious in many places where both men campaigned hard for their parties' candidates.\n\nFor that reason, the president even found some silver-lining in the Republican defeats, tweeting Wednesday that those who \"worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well\" while those that did not stick with him now must \"say goodbye!\"\n\nAnd Trump, who loves a good foil, will now have House Democrats to blame for just about every obstacle facing his agenda.\n\nThose that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well. Those that did not, say goodbye! Yesterday was such a very Big Win, and all under the pressure of a Nasty and Hostile Media! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2018\n\nLoser: Moderate Republicans\n\nMany Republicans who distanced themselves from the president did so because they were in competitive districts where Trump's low popularity numbers and divisive politics made him more of a liability than an asset.\n\nFor the most part, those were moderate Republicans such as Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo and New Jersey Rep. Leonard Lance. With the moderates getting knocked out, the remaining Republican minority will likely move even closer to the president and adhere closely to his agenda.\n\nWinner: Women and LGBTQ candidates\n\nThe next Congress will include a record number of female members, with at least 113 women winning seats Tuesday (the previous high was 107). Women made up about two-thirds of the districts that Democrats managed to flip in order to gain control of the House.\n\nAnd 11 women were elected to the Senate and another nine won governors' races.\n\nCandidates from the LGBTQ community also won historic victories Tuesday. Colorado's Jared Polis became the first openly gay man to win a governor's race. In Kansas, Sharice Davids, an LGBTQ Native American, defeated incumbent Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder.\n\nContributing: Nicole Gaudiano, USA TODAY\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/07/election-2018-winners-and-losers/1917410002/", "CLOSE The election results are in and Democrats gained control of the House during the midterms. It will place a check and balance on President Trump's power and could tie up his agenda for the next couple of years. USA TODAY\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., celebrates a Democratic Party takeover of the House of Representatives during a midterm election night party hosted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on November 6, 2018, in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Brendan Smialowski, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nUntil Tuesday night, the federal courts have served as the only check against President Donald Trump's widespread efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and restrict legal immigration.\n\nBut with the Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives following Tuesday night\u2019s midterm elections, the president\u2019s most controversial measures over the past two years will be investigated, his current crackdown efforts will be more closely scrutinized, and Democrats will use their newfound control of the nation\u2019s purse strings to rein in his future immigration plans.\n\nThe only constants are that congressional gridlock will endure and a broad, nuanced comprehensive immigration reform will likely remain elusive, say immigration experts on all sides of the debate.\n\n\u201cNothing was passing the Republican House on immigration, and it\u2019s even less likely now that anything is going to pass Congress,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for lower levels of legal immigration and stricter enforcement against illegal immigration.\n\nDuring her acceptance speech in Washington on Tuesday night, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi focused on her legislative priorities but made clear that the victory was about \u201crestoring the constitutional checks and balances to the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nThat means Democrats, who will now head all House committees, will use their powers to investigate and subpoena witnesses to pore through the administration's most controversial immigration actions over the past two years.\n\nThe list of topics could include the president's \"zero-tolerance\" policy that led to more than 2,500 family separations over the summer, his efforts to curb refugee and asylum admissions to the U.S., the treatment of immigrants in detention centers, the inclusion of a citizenship question on the 2020 Census, and his deployment of more than 7,000 active-duty military troops to the southwest border in reaction to a current caravan of Central American migrants making their way through Mexico.\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., is expected to assume the chairmanship of the House Judiciary Committee when the new Congress convenes in January. The committee has jurisdiction over a range of immigration-related issues. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP)\n\nMany of those investigations are expected to be led by the House Judiciary Committee. Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., is expected to assume the chairmanship when the new Congress convenes in January. The 71-year-old is a Brooklyn native who represents a district that includes a large chunk of Manhattan, making him a surefire target of Trump in the years to come.\n\nNadler has largely embraced positions that help immigrant families, as evidenced by his \"F-\" grade from NumbersUSA, a group that advocates for lower levels of legal and illegal immigration. After easily securing his win Tuesday night, Nadler issued a statement declaring that the new-look Congress will immediately reassert its oversight role.\n\n\"Americans are tired of watching a Republican Congress fail in its constitutional duty to hold the administration accountable for policies that rip children from the arms of their parents,\" he said.\n\nThe prospect of both chambers agreeing on any immigration bills, however, will run straight through Nadler\u2019s counterpart on the Senate Judiciary Committee, expected to be Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., after Republicans maintained control of the Senate.\n\nGraham has a come a long way since he openly embraced \"amnesty\" for undocumented immigrants as a member of the Gang of 8, a bipartisan group of senators that passed a comprehensive immigration bill through the Senate in 2013 \u2013 an effort that died when the Republican-led House refused to even consider the bill, said Krikorian.\n\nGraham has since adopted a more \"conservative,\" Trump-friendly posture on immigration issues, Krikorian said, meaning he won't allow his committee to approve bills that are too immigration-friendly.\n\nU.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham speaks with media about the events surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation before speaking at the 1st Monday Club of Anderson at Master's Wok in Anderson, S.C., on Oct. 1, 2018. (Photo: Ken Ruinard, Anderson Independent Mail)\n\n\"Immigration in the Senate is going to be the Lindsey Graham show,\" said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a group that advocates for immigrants.\n\nTwo such battles that Congress will have to fight soon will provide an indication of how that relationship between the two chambers will play out.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken moves to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, and the Temporary Protected Status program, known as TPS.\n\nDACA has allowed more than 800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children to legally live and work in the U.S. The TPS program has done the same for more than 300,000 foreigners whose nations suffered civil strife and natural disasters.\n\nFederal courts have ordered the administration to maintain both programs, but the Supreme Court, now featuring two Trump appointees, could uphold the president's moves. That would put the onus on Congress to find a solution for those groups.\n\nNoorani said the most likely scenario is that the House passes bills to protect DACA and TPS but then runs into a wall in Graham's Judiciary Committee. There, Noorani expects Graham to cram in as many of Trump's immigration enforcement measures as he can, jeopardizing passage of any DACA or TPS fix.\n\nFinding any common ground on a broader immigration bill like the one passed by the Senate in 2013 will be even harder, according to Brad Jones, a political science professor at the University of California, Davis, who studies immigration policy.\n\n\u201cWill we see reform? No, not in the sense of a bill with a guest worker program and a path to citizenship,\u201d for the nation\u2019s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants, Jones said.\n\nThe most realistic possibility is that the Pelosi-led House will mostly serve as a block against Trump\u2019s continued efforts to limit immigration. For example, the current troop deployment to the southern border requires funding, something Democrats can control through the budgeting process. The border wall the president vowed to build since his presidential campaign needs funding. And Democrats can try to limit his more recent plans to end birthright citizenship or suspend asylum applications for members of the migrant caravan that dominated Trump's midterm strategy.\n\n\"One implication of this election is that funding for something like a border wall is probably going to be off the table,\" Jones said. \"Some of the most draconian legislation that Republicans fantasize about are now off the table.\"\n\nMore: How House Democrats will thwart Trump\u2019s agenda\n\nMore: Democrats seize control of House, power to investigate President Trump\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/07/election-results-2018-donald-trump-immigration-building-wall-nancy-pelosi-democrats-house/1917575002/", "Alabama\u2019s complete domination of the SEC may ensure that only one team from the conference makes this year\u2019s College Football Playoff.

Best Television: LG C8 Series\n\nThe best electronics of 2018: LG C8 (Photo: Reviewed)\n\nFor years, OLED technology has been the most impressive thing in TV tech, and OLED TVs have been our top-ranked televisions for the same amount of time. At the cutting edge of screen tech, OLED TVs are capable of a natural contrast, color production, and viewing angle efficacy that almost no LED/LCD TV can match.\n\nIt makes sense, then, that the best TV you can buy this year is an OLED model. The LG C8 is uniquely positioned in 2018 as the most affordable of LG's core OLED lineup. There's a cheaper OLED series, the B8, but it skimps on some processing power compared to the other 2018 series. All in all, the C8 delivers the most power at the cheapest price, making it our #1 TV pick this year.\n\nGet the LG C8 Series TV on Amazon for $2,976.99\n\n2.

The active noise cancellation (ANC) Bose here works perfectly to cut out a wide range of noises\u2014from the deep rumbles of subway trains to high-pitched HVAC humming. The 35 IIs are light enough to be worn for hours at a time, and provide about 20 hours of battery life on a single charge. Plus, their sound profile is relatively well-rounded, gently emphasizing bass and higher pitches.\n\nThe only real drawback is the price\u2014around $350.

The aluminum body is slim and lightweight, but doesn't bow under pressure. The convertible hinge design also lets you rotate the lid all the way around so you can use it like a tablet, making it easier to share information in a classroom setting. While it's pricier than your average Chromebook, if you're hunting for a sophisticated-looking machine for schoolwork, it doesn't get much better than this.\n\nGet the Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA laptop on Amazon for $474.99\n\n7.

That why it's our best-for-the-money laptop.\n\nYou're also getting a standard 4 GB of RAM and a 1 TB spinning hard drive, ensuring a respectable chunk of storage to start out with. While the Aspire is bulky and thick, it's also powerful and easy to upgrade, ensuring potential years of capable performance even when you're running modern programs. We're fans of the trackpad and backlit keyboard, an amenity that is almost unheard-of at this price. If you're looking to get the most laptop at the least price, we heartily recommend the Acer Aspire E 15.\n\nGet the Acer Aspire E 15 laptop on Amazon for $549.99\n\n8. Best Camera: Sony Alpha a9\n\nThe best electronics of 2018 (Photo: Reviewed)\n\nThe Sony Alpha a9 is the kind of camera that only comes along once every couple of years. It's a world-beating mirrorless model with the autofocus and burst shooting chops to credibly stand toe-to-toe with the best Canon and Nikon DSLRs. Though maximizing its potential means living with quirks some professionals may not love, it's worth it thanks to the power Sony has packed in here.\n\nThe speed of this full-frame camera is simply incredible, and the low light performance is astounding given the technology. Every camera has some trade-offs, and the a9 is no exception, but it has enough going for it that professionals everywhere should have this blue ribbon camera on their radars.\n\nGet the Sony Alpha a9 camera on Amazon for $4,498\n\n9.

That's where an advanced compact camera like the Panasonic Lumic LX10can really come in handy. Simply put, Panasonic seems to know exactly what enthusiasts want in a point-and-shoot.\n\nThe nuanced controls and rear-tilting touchscreen LCD make you feel like you're handling a much pricier model. And of course, the LX10 takes good still photos and even better video\u2014Panasonic's 4K capture is among the best, especially for casual video shooting. There are few cameras that are more convenient and fully-featured, and almost none at this price.\n\nGet the Panasonic Lumic LX10 camera at Walmart for $545\n\n10. Best Drone for Money: Potensic T25\n\nThe best electronics of 2018: Potensic drone (Photo: Reviewed)\n\nThe Potensic T25 is our favorite affordable drone. For under $200, this drone has just about anything you could ask for: stability, GPS, a 1080p camera, and more.

It took social media to spread the message because the traditional media, including Argentina's top TV channels and newspapers, didn't even cover the continental championship.\n\n\"We live in a soccer-mad country but with a lot of machismo,\" Argentina forward Belen Potassa said at the national team's training grounds on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. \"Soccer is Messi, (Gonzalo) Higuain, (Diego) Maradona and no one else.\"\n\nWhile those players are adored and even idolized, the women's team has been sidelined \u2014 just like in other countries around the world.\n\nThe Argentine soccer federation often is late in paying travel expenses while the players have routinely faced the prejudices of a chauvinistic society that sees soccer as a men's only game. Still, the long-disadvantaged team of women may be on the verge of a game changer by defying long-established gender inequalities and proving themselves on and off the field.\n\nBy finishing third at the Copa America, the team in the light blue-and-white striped shirts earned a place in the playoffs for this year's Women's World Cup in France. Argentina will play Panama on Thursday for a spot in the 24-team tournament. For the first time in the country's women's soccer history, the game will be played at a sold out stadium in Buenos Aires.\n\nAnother major achievement came in practice.\n\nThe women's team was recently allowed to train at the same complex where Messi and the rest of the men's team prepare for games, grounds that until recently were reserved for men only.\n\n\"Women fight since they're born because we don't have the same rights as men. But in sports the sacrifice is twice as tough. They don't pay you, the clothes are not the same, the sponsors are not the same,\" said Potassa, who recently signed a contract with a well-known sports brand that supplies her with boots and clothing.\n\nThe women's team's progress has even received the support of Messi and several Argentine professional clubs that have promoted the playoff game against Panama on social media under the motto: \"It's time to root for them.\"\n\nMany female players say they feel part of a cultural change driven by the country's strong feminist movement, which has mobilized tens of thousands to fight against violence against women, and helped them gain ground in politics and the workplace.\n\nBut to gain equality, there is still a long way to go.\n\nWhile the men's league draws huge crowds and brings in millions of dollars, female players are amateurs and get about 3,000 pesos (about $82) for travel expenses at a first division club. If a woman plays for the national team, she'll earn 300 pesos ($8) a day.\n\nThat forces players to split their time between soccer and a second job to survive, said Potassa, who is also a receptionist at a local college.\n\nVeteran goalkeeper Vanina Correa, the only mother in the national team, said the hardest part is being away from her children, Romeo and Luna. The 4-year-old twins stay with their grandmother while Correa trains for the playoff more than 185 miles (300 kilometers) from home.\n\n\"It's very hard to be here,\" said Correa, who doubles as a municipal employee. \"I'm always thinking about home and wondering what they're doing and if they're behaving.\n\n\"It would be more comfortable if we could live off soccer. I don't have much left (in my career) but we're fighting for the girls who are coming next.\"\n\nThat fight has been going on all over the world.\n\nAhead of the last Women's World Cup in 2015, a group of international players protested because the tournament was scheduled to be played on artificial turf, which is considered by many to be inferior to the real grass that has always been used in the men's game.\n\nThe tournament in Canada went on to be a huge success: It attracted the biggest crowds of any FIFA tournament outside of a men's World Cup and broke TV rating records in North America, with the final drawing more viewers than any other prior men's or women's match in the United States.\n\nFollowing their victory over Japan for the trophy, the U.S. women went on to campaign for, and receive, a better contract with U.S. Soccer that brought them closer to the compensation level of their male counterparts. The Americans were not alone. National teams from other countries also won more equitable contracts with their federations, including Australia and Ireland.\n\nBut in Argentina, that kind of change still seems far away and female soccer players must join leagues in neighboring Brazil, Europe or the United States to make a living from the sport.\n\nOne of the major obstacles they face is the lack of attention. It wasn't until this year that a non-sports TV channel finally began broadcasting league games.\n\n\"Women are not accepted in this environment yet. That's why there's so much resistance to broadcasting female sports, especially soccer,\" said 19-year-old wingback Luana Munoz, who also plays for Tyler Junior College in Texas. \"It has to be promoted, people need to know that it is being played, they need to know the name of the players, and the tournament has to be competitive.\"\n\nInternationally, FIFA has made a point of proclaiming that it aims to raise both the role of women in the governing body and the profile of the women's game. Fatma Samoura was appointed the organization's first female secretary general in 2016, and a women's soccer division was created.\n\nIn Argentina, the development taking place in local women's soccer is a recent phenomenon.\n\n\"When we asked our youngest daughter what sport she wanted to practice, she said soccer. She ended up playing hockey,\" said Ricardo Pinela, president of the Argentine federation's women's soccer committee. \"The first step is that the girls have the possibility to kick a ball in front of their house. This will generate the development of female soccer and we will see equality in the number of men and women playing the game.\"\n\nThe inequality faced by the Argentines is seen in countries throughout South America, including Chile, which has already qualified for the World Cup. The only exception perhaps is Brazil, where six-time world player of the year Marta has given the women's game a platform for success.\n\n\"(Men's) professional clubs don't carry the responsibility or care about granting the girls the most basic work conditions,\" said Freddy Contreras, who is in charge of the female team at Colo Colo, the most popular club in Chile.\n\nContreras said clubs don't lend women fields for training and only supply them with one set of shirts.\n\nThe Argentine women's team only was given access to the men's training ground after its poor working conditions became publicly known.\n\n\"These are things that we didn't have before,\" Munoz said. \"It doesn't give us the same status but it gets us close. We're being given the same place as the professionals. That's very important to us, even if it's small, even if it's a detail.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Eva Vergara in Santiago, Chile, and AP Sports Writer Anne M.

Yet any success he could claim and use to buoy his party was enabled by inheriting a growing economy from the nation\u2019s first African-American president.\n\nDemocratic candidates for the House will likely end up defeating their opponents by a larger margin than any recent Republican \u201cwave\u201d election \u2014 but the GOP still has a near stranglehold on the federal government.\n\nHouse oversight won't stop unethical behavior\n\nA record number of women is now headed to Congress.

Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, as of January will no longer be able to subpoena documents he won\u2019t read to obstruct investigations into a campaign he helped transition into power. So under Democrats we may finally get the House oversight we used to take for granted \u2014 including Trump\u2019s tax returns, which could give us some idea of who actually provided the $66 million he put into his 2016 campaign.\n\nBut with an even larger majority in the Senate, Trump will be able to fill his administration with even more compromised lackeys determined to make sure his administration is run by the same ethical standards as Trump University. For instance, Trump will surely be able to install an attorney general who\u2019d gladly let this president spray or neuter special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation (if it hasn\u2019t been gutted by the time you read this).\n\nA record number of American voters came to the polls for a midterm election, and automatic voter registration and gerrymandering reform won wherever they were on the ballot.

Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who acted as the chief election official and oversaw the purging of over 680,000 voter registrations, now claims to be governor-elect after winning that race by well under 100,000 votes.\n\nMedicaid expansion won in three of the four red states where it was on the ballot (Montana, Nebraska and Utah), and the Affordable Care Act is now unlikely to repealed until at least 2021, if ever. But the Trump administration can continue to chip away at it with requirements and junk plans expressly designed to erode the protections the law is built upon.\n\nWith his unrepentant appeals built on bigotry and often-audible dog whistles, Trump tightened his grasp on rural areas, especially in the south. But Republicans lost their governorships in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 three states that were crucial to his 2016 win.\n\nAmerica is rejecting Trump's advances\n\nWith so many clouds of despair and so many glimmers of hope, looking at the results of this election can be dizzying.

(Photo: Jerome Miron, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Kevin Harvick\u2019s bid for a second NASCAR title suffered a massive setback when he was stripped of his berth in the championship race after series inspectors found his winning car from Texas Motor Speedway had been deliberately altered to give him a performance advantage.\n\nNASCAR said Wednesday night it believes Harvick\u2019s spoiler was intentionally offset to the right to give the Ford an aerodynamic advantage when he drove through the corners at Texas. NASCAR can\u2019t prove if Stewart-Haas Racing made its own spoiler or altered one from its manufacturer, but senior vice president of competition Scott Miller said the penalty is the same in either case.\n\nThe illegal spoiler was not found until the No. 4 Ford received a thorough inspection at NASCAR\u2019s Research and Development Center when it was returned to North Carolina after Sunday\u2019s race. An inspector at Texas thought the spoiler looked off, but Miller said it had to be removed from the car. Once that happened, it was \u201c100 percent, as black and white as it gets,\u201d Miller said.\n\nSpoilers will be checked at Phoenix this weekend, Miller said, and NASCAR will likely ramp up its penalties next year.\n\n\u201cWe need to change the culture to where we don\u2019t have to play this cat and mouse game with the teams,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting borderline ridiculous.\u201d\n\nThe whopping penalty negated the automatic berth Harvick earned into NASCAR\u2019s version of a final four. In addition to losing his spot in next weekend\u2019s finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, Harvick must also close out the final two races of the season without crew chief Rodney Childers and car chief Robert Smith. Both were suspended for two races. Childers also was fined $75,000.\n\nHarvick was docked 40 driver points, and Stewart-Haas Racing was docked 40 owner points as well. Harvick enters this weekend\u2019s race at Phoenix fourth among the remaining eight playoff drivers, three points above the cutline. Should there be a tie for the final transfer spot, Harvick would not be eligible to use the Texas victory in the tiebreaking procedure.\n\nMore: NASCAR apologizes after mistakenly penalizing Johnson at Texas race\n\nMore: For NASCAR, the future is now at Arizona's ISM Raceway\n\nMore: NASCAR CEO Brian France's DWI case continued until December\n\nGreg Zipadelli, vice president of competition at SHR, said the team will not appeal the penalties. Tony Gibson will be Harvick\u2019s interim crew chief and Nick DeFazio will be interim car chief.\n\n\u201cWe work tirelessly across every inch of our race cars to create speed and, unfortunately, NASCAR determined we ventured into an area not accommodated by its rule book,\u201d Zipadelli said. \u201cWe will not appeal the penalty. Instead, we will direct our immediate focus to this weekend\u2019s event in Phoenix and control our destiny on the racetrack.\u201d\n\nHarvick\u2019s win at Texas was his series-leading eighth of the year and qualified him for Homestead along with Joey Logano. Now, three spots in the finale will be up for grabs Sunday in Phoenix.\n\nHarvick won the 2014 Cup Series championship and went to Phoenix that season in a must-win situation to race for the title. He pulled it off and is a nine-time winner at Phoenix, including earlier this year.\n\nHarvick has been in NASCAR\u2019s finale three of the last four years.\n\nThe penalty is disastrous for SHR, which went into the third round of the playoffs with all four of its drivers eligible for the championship. Logano grabbed the first spot, which meant the best SHR could do was qualify three cars for Homestead. Now, SHR could wind up locked out of the finale outright if Harvick doesn\u2019t advance past Phoenix. Aric Almirola, Kurt Busch and Clint Bowyer are all below the cutline and likely need to win at Phoenix to advance.\n\nThe penalty against Harvick also closes a rough race for NASCAR, which erroneously penalized Jimmie Johnson moments before the race began. Johnson was sent to the back of the field because NASCAR believed his car failed inspection three times, but he had failed only twice.\n\nNASCAR announced the mistake during the race and said Monday it has updated its procedures to prevent a similar mistake moving forward. Later in the same event, Bowyer was penalized for a crew member being over the pit road wall too early. The crew member was sitting on the wall with his feet touching the asphalt on pit road, which was a violation, even if it seemed extreme.\n\nNow Harvick\u2019s team has been rocked by a penalty that may change the composition of the final four drivers racing for the title. Harvick, along with Kyle Busch and Martin Truex Jr., is part of NASCAR\u2019s so-called Big Three that dominated the season through a stretch of summer racing. All three were expected to race for the championship, and none is qualified for Homestead yet with one race remaining.\n\n\u201cIt is not our desire to issue any penalties, but we\u2019ll do so when necessary to ensure each race and championship is contested on a level playing field,\u201d Miller said earlier Wednesday. \u201cWe will now return our focus to Phoenix, and the battle for a championship.\u201d\n\nNASCAR later allowed Miller to answer questions about Harvick\u2019s penalty because of the magnitude of the situation. NASCAR had moved away in recent years from detailing infractions publicly.\n\nAlso Wednesday, NASCAR penalized the teams of Ryan Blaney and Erik Jones, who already have been eliminated from the playoffs.\n\nBlaney crew chief Jeremy Bullins was fined $50,000, and car chief Kirk Almquist was suspended for the next two races. Jones crew chief Chris Gayle was fined $50,000 and car chief Jason Overstreet was suspended the next two races.\n\nIt took until Wednesday for the penalties to be announced because the cars were in transit Monday from Texas to North Carolina. Inspection was on Tuesday, and the teams do the actual teardown themselves. Once the Harvick violation was discovered late Tuesday, NASCAR had to examine whether the violation was correct and didn\u2019t release its findings until the next day \u2013 two days before Harvick and his interim crew chief and car chief will practice at Phoenix.", "President Donald Trump speaks at the Latino Coalition Legislative Summit, Wednesday, March 7, 2018, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) ORG XMIT: DCEV109 (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nCorrections & clarifications: An earlier version of this story misstated Victor Sanchez's position on President Trump's views on birthright citizenship.\n\nAdryana Aldeen hovered outside a Dallas polling station Tuesday with a sign that read, \"Pete Sessions for Congress\" and a T-shirt that said, \"Latinas for Abbott\" \u2013 promoting the incumbent Republican U.S. congressman from the Dallas suburbs and the incumbent Republican governor of Texas.\n\nAldeen, who immigrated from Mexico three decades ago, wasn't letting President Donald Trump's harsh rhetoric on illegal immigration get in the way of Republican wins.\n\n\"I believe in the sovereignty of the state,\" said Aldeen, a GOP activist and special adviser for Hispanic engagement for the Republican Party of Texas. \"This is a nation of immigrants, but we need to do everything we can for the rule of law.\"\n\nAldeen joined a significant number of immigrant voters who supported the Republican Party on Tuesday and, in turn, Trump, despite the president's controversial stances on immigration leading up to the elections.\n\nOver the past few months, Trump initiated a \"zero tolerance\" policy that led to immigrant children being separated from their parents at the border, warned about a caravan of immigrants coming from Central America, threatened to eliminate birthright citizenship and retweeted a racially charged video linking a convicted murderer to immigrants and the Democratic Party.\n\nThe tough talk didn't seem to chase away immigrant voters in significant numbers. Tuesday, Democrats got about 68 percent of the Latino vote, slightly higher than the 66 percent won by Hillary Clinton in 2016, while Republicans garnered 30 percent of their vote, just above the 28 percent Trump earned two years ago, according to exit polling.\n\nAsian voters sided with Democrats 77 percent of the time in Tuesday's elections, and Republicans received 23 percent of their vote, the exit polling showed.\n\nVictor Sanchez, a pro-Trump Republican from Houston, said he was not fazed by the president's tough talk on securing the border or other controversial stances on immigration.\n\nAt a Trump rally in Houston last month supporting Sen. Ted Cruz, Sanchez, 25, who immigrated to the USA from Mexico when he was 5, said he was pleased to see other Latinos, from Mexico, Cuba and other countries, rallying around the president and his policies.\n\n\"There's thousands and thousands of them,\" Sanchez said. \"They may be a little shy ... but once they go to the polls, they vote their conscience.\"\n\nSaba Ahmed, president of the Washington-based Republican Muslim Coalition and a Trump supporter, said it was initially a challenge persuading Muslim immigrants to support the president and the GOP after Trump proposed a travel ban on five predominately Muslim countries.\n\nAhmed told potential voters it's better to try to initiate change from the inside than complain about policies from the outside. She got candidates to speak at Muslim gatherings and would like to see a Muslim in Trump's Cabinet.\n\n\"The greatest opportunity for immigrants is within the Republican Party,\" Ahmed said. \"We have to get involved.

We did a couple of shows earlier in the year together and everybody hit it off so well. My two lead singers, Lou Gramm and (current frontman) Kelly Hansen, really hit it off like a house on fire and the rest of the guys were happy to be a part of it. It was very emotional. It brought up a lot of stuff from the past, but it just felt natural and we fell right back into it.\n\nQ: Was it hard to get all the guys back together?\n\nLou Gramm: Surprisingly not. Everybody was actually pretty boned up on their instruments and with a little bit of practice, it was sounding good. Everyone was anxious within reason. We didn\u2019t want to make more of it than what it was, but it ends up being a lot of fun.\n\nCurrent and original members of rock band Foreigner, who will play four shows together as part of \"Double Vision: Then and Now.\" (Photo: Karsten Staiger)\n\nQ: With so many members of Foreigner past and present on stage, how do you plan to divvy up the set list?\n\nGramm: The original band is concentrating on songs from \u201cDouble Vision\u201d and then (the current lineup) plays songs from any and all of the albums. After they play and we play, we come out for an encore and do \u201cJuke Box Hero\" and \u201cHot Blooded\u201d together.\n\nQ: What do you remember about the reception to \"Double Vision\" in 1978?\n\nJones: With that album, there was a huge amount of pressure on us to avoid the \"sophomore jinx.\" A lot of people were wondering whether we could repeat the incredible success of the first album (their 1977 self-titled debut). Plus, we were going head to head with The Rolling Stones' \"Some Girls,\" (which was released the same month as \"Double Vision\"). We kept a tally of sales and after about 10 months, we outsold The Rolling Stones. It didn't get much better than that.\n\nQ: Lou, you said in an interview back in 2013 that you and Mick had \"no relationship\" whatsoever.\n\nGramm: At that point, we weren\u2019t on very good terms. But in 2015, we were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and they wanted us to perform together. So we kind of broke the ice in rehearsals, and it certainly was an honor to be inducted with my writing partner. After that, the relationship warmed up.\n\nJones: We both were struck by much good stuff we've achieved together, so why not just bury the hatchet and move on?\n\nLou Gramm and Mick Jones put their differences aside to perform together at the Songwriters Hall of Fame induction ceremony in New York in 2013. (Photo: TIMOTHY CLARY, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nQ: Why didn't you speak for so many years?\n\nJones: We were at odds with each other. We had never really come to any kind of closure on several breakups of the band and still felt a little animosity between us.

But \u201cif he wows us,\u201d Van Wagenen continued, \u201cyou never know,\u201d keeping open the possibility that the former football star could spend Opening Day in the Majors.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Tebow\u2019s former agent happens to be \u2026 Brodie Van Wagenen. And that\u2019s just one of the things that got WFAN\u2019s Mike Francesa heated in a long rant on Tuesday:\n\nReaction: @MikeFrancesa on BVW's comments on Tim Tebow possibly being on Opening Day roster. https://t.co/0vyNuJvYgR \u2014 Brian Monzo (@BMonzoRadio) November 6, 2018\n\n\u201cTim Tebow is likely to begin 2019 at Triple-A level for the Mets and the new general manager did not rule out the possibility that he could make the Opening Day major league roster, which is nothing short of an absolute joke, okay? Tim Tebow is 30 years old. You\u2019re trying to build a winning culture, and you\u2019re going to tell me that you\u2019re going to put Tim Tebow on your major-league roster? Are you kidding me? You want to be a clown or a laughingstock before you even start here? I mean, you\u2019re going to tell me you\u2019re going to put this guy, he\u2019s 30 years old, you\u2019re going to put this guy on the major league roster, he\u2019s never even played in Triple-A. \u2026 Clown statements like that, we\u2019re not going to take you seriously. \u2026 Start Mr. Met in center and be a carnival act!\u201d\n\nThe only thing Francesa is wrong about here is Tebow\u2019s age \u2014 he turned 31 this year. When he figured out the general manager was Tebow\u2019s ex-agent, he flipped out further, calling for Van Wagenen to apologize to Mets fans for even suggesting Tebow would be on the Opening Day roster.", "CLOSE Oprah Winfrey released her 22nd list of her favorite things ahead of the holiday season that includes 107 items.

Terrill, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) \u2014 The Atlanta Falcons made a move to bolster their lackluster pass rush by agreeing to a one-year deal with defensive end Bruce Irvin on Wednesday, reuniting the veteran with coach Dan Quinn.\n\nIrvin, cut by the Oakland Raiders on Saturday, became a free agent after clearing waivers on Tuesday with $3.8 million remaining on his contract. The Falcons play at Cleveland on Sunday.\n\nIrvin, 31, is an Atlanta native. He celebrated his return home by posting on his Twitter account \"Man it's time! You can't put a price on the chance for me to play for my people and city! It's bigger than money!\"\n\nIrvin was expected to arrive in Atlanta on Wednesday night and join practice on Thursday. Quinn said Irvin will play against Cleveland.\n\nThe Falcons rank 27th in the league with 17 sacks. Takk McKinley has a team-leading 5\u00bd sacks, but Vic Beasley has only one. Beasley led the league with 15\u00bd sacks in 2016.\n\nThe Falcons hope Irvin adds new punch to the pass rush.\n\n\"He's definitely a big addition to our team,\" said defensive tackle Grady Jarrett, who has three sacks. \"As a player and as a person, we know the personality he plays with matches what we want to portray or have up front, that dog mentality. We're ready to go hunt.\"\n\nQuinn said the homecoming and the chance to play in a familiar scheme were motivating factors for Irvin.\n\n\"It's pretty rare you get to play in your home city,\" Quinn said. \"He recognized that might be a special moment for him and he really is challenged.\"\n\nQuinn said Irvin also is motivated to show he can be a successful pass-rushing end after being waived by the Raiders.\n\n\"He really is ready to prove it,\" Quinn said, adding often a player's \"most memorable competitive moments are in prove-it times, so I love it he feels he's got some things to prove and really wants to play well. That's what we talked about.\"\n\nThe Falcons' defense had more good news on Wednesday. Linebacker Deion Jones, who has been on injured reserve since suffering a foot injury in the season-opening loss at Philadelphia, returned to practice. He is not eligible to return until next week's game against Dallas and has not been placed on the active roster.\n\n\"It's going to be awesome,\" said Beasley of Jones' return. \"We've been waiting on him to come back. He's a definite leader on the defensive side of the ball and not just the defense, on this team. There are a lot of guys who look up to him.\"\n\nQuinn said Jones' snaps in practice will be watched closely this week. He said he has no timetable on Jones being cleared for a game.\n\nThe Falcons (4-4) have won three straight despite losing starting safeties Ricardo Allen and Keanu Neal to season-ending injuries. Starting guards Andy Levitre and Brando Fusco and running back Devonta Freeman also are on IR.\n\nIrvin played with Seattle when Quinn was the team's defensive coordinator.\n\nIrvin had three sacks with Oakland, but played only nine snaps in a 34-3 loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Thursday night.\n\nIrvin (6-3, 250) played four seasons with Seattle before joining the Raiders in 2016. He had eight sacks as a rookie in 2012 and matched that career high with Oakland in 2017.\n\nHe set a career high with six forced fumbles in 2016. His 11 forced fumbles since the start of the 2016 season are the most in the NFL in that span.\n\nFor his career, Irvin has 40 sacks and 15 forced fumbles.\n\nOakland was expected to enter the season with Irvin and Khalil Mack leading the defense as bookend pass rushers.\n\nInstead, Mack was traded to Chicago a week before the season for a package of draft picks following a lengthy holdout. The Raiders rank last in the league with seven sacks.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It will place a check and balance on President Trump's power and could tie up his agenda for the next couple of years. USA TODAY\n\nU.S. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) speaks during a rally Sept. 26, 2018 at the West Lawn of the Capitol in Washington. (Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images)\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, easily won re-election Tuesday night for a seventh term in Congress. Now that he\u2019s done with that, scrutiny should return to his alleged role in failing to stop an Ohio State team doctor from molesting student-athletes when Jordan was an assistant wrestling coach at the school from 1986-94.\n\nBack in the summer, seven former OSU wrestlers accused Jordan of being among the university coaches and faculty members who ignored the sexual abuse of team doctor Richard Strauss, who committed suicide in 2005.\n\nJordan denied the allegations then, saying, \u201cI never knew about any type of abuse. If I did, I would have done something about it.\u201d\n\nYet, in a Fox News interview, Jordan did admit that he heard \u201cconversations in a locker room\u201d about the issue.\n\nJordan said he was interviewed over the summer as part of an independent investigation that was announced by the university in April, and the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights also launched a Title IX investigation into the allegations in August. An Ohio State spokesman said Wednesday the school\u2019s independent investigation remains underway.\n\nNearly 150 former Ohio State students have reported misconduct by Strauss, including athletes from at least 16 varsity sports.\n\nBut as the election ramped up, this story actually grew quiet. There was the occasional outrage on social media, but nothing stood in Jordan\u2019s way as he stormed to an easy victory over Democrat Janet Garrett in a safe Republican district. His winning margin was 65.4 percent to 34.6 percent, only slightly worse than his two previous races against Garrett in 2014 and 2016.\n\nMore: Democrats seize control of House, power to investigate President Trump\n\nMore: President Trump touts 'magic' Senate wins, ignores House losses\n\nSo Jordan returns to Washington, but no longer in the House majority. How can these allegations not follow him there? How is this not a bigger story? After the horrifying sex abuse scandals at Penn State, Michigan State and USA Gymnastics, how did Jordan simply sail through this election season?\n\nHe had help. President Donald Trump certainly did his part. Even though Trump of course has no idea what happened in Strauss\u2019 office at Ohio State three decades ago, that didn\u2019t stop him from blindly defending Jordan when the accusations mounted back in July.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe them at all,\u201d Trump said of Jordan\u2019s accusers. \u201cI believe him. Jim Jordan is one of the most outstanding people I\u2019ve met since I\u2019ve been in Washington. I believe him 100 percent. No question in my mind. I believe Jim Jordan 100 percent. He\u2019s an outstanding man.\u201d\n\nTrump took one look at a college sex abuse scandal and turned it into political theater. Apparently, he has learned nothing from what happened at Penn State, Michigan State and USA Gymnastics.\n\nIn July, a former OSU wrestler who has staunchly defended Jordan told USA TODAY that the locker room conversations Jordan said he heard involved wrestlers saying \u201cprepare to drop your pants\u201d when going to see Strauss for any ailment or injury.\n\nMichael Alf, who wrestled at Ohio State from 1988-92, said he was part of a conference call with several former OSU wrestlers who have supported Jordan. \u201cWe don\u2019t blame Jimmy, but the guys are saying, \u2018Jim, why don\u2019t you just tell that you heard about this as it was going along? We know you were young and you didn\u2019t put it together.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI participated with Jimmy (Jordan) and the other wrestlers in locker room talk about Strauss,\u201d former OSU wrestler Shawn Dailey, who said he was groped half a dozen times by Strauss in the mid-1990s, told NBC News. \u201cWe all did. It was very common knowledge in the locker room that if you went to Dr. Strauss for anything, you would have to pull your pants down.\n\n\u201cWhat happened drove me out of the sport,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I was surprised to hear Jim say that he knew nothing about it. Jimmy\u2019s a good guy, but to say that he had no knowledge of it, I would say that\u2019s kind of hurtful.\u201d\n\nMark Coleman, another former OSU wrestler, told The Wall Street Journal that Jordan was aware of the abuse and did not take action.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way unless he\u2019s got dementia or something that he\u2019s got no recollection of what was going on at Ohio State,\u201d said Coleman, who said he was Jordan\u2019s roommate on several trips.\n\nNow that Jordan is heading back to Washington, this important story should shadow his every step.", "bad url", "Czech Republic captain Petr Pala attends a press conference prior to the final match of the Fed Cup between Czech Republic and the US in Prague, Czech Republic, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018.

Cam Newton, Panthers: A thrilling Thursday night matchup against the Steelers will be Newton\u2019s latest chance to put his increased efficiency under new offensive coordinator Norv Turner on display. Pittsburgh ranks fourth in sacks (26), but Newton has gotten improved protection from his front and is difficult to take down.\n\n2. Tom Brady, Patriots: Not only do the Titans have the NFL\u2019s top scoring defense (17.6 points a game), but head coach Mike Vrabel \u2013 who was Brady\u2019s teammate from 2001-08 \u2013 is very familiar with New England. Brady and the Pats offense have found their stride in recent weeks, but Tennessee is fresh off of an impressive performance in which it allowed the Cowboys to convert just one of four trips to the red zone.\n\n3. Dak Prescott, Cowboys: The addition of receiver Amari Cooper to the offense offered a boost, but Prescott \u2013 especially in a first-quarter interception in the end zone \u2013 too often forced the ball. Dallas\u2019 play calling remains inconsistent, and with a huge Sunday night showdown against the division-rival Eagles, Prescott will need to shine.\n\nMore: Troy Aikman says Cowboys are dysfunctional, recommends 'a complete overhaul'\n\nMore: NFL power rankings: Saints take top spot from Rams, battered Redskins plummet from top 10\n\n4. Baker Mayfield, Browns: Cleveland showed improvements with Freddie Kitchens taking over the offense, but Mayfield will need to be even better against the high-scoring Falcons. Look for running back Duke Johnson again to be a factor in the passing game after recording two touchdown catches last week.\n\n5. Nick Mullens, 49ers: Making his debut as an undrafted free agent who had never taken a regular-season snap, Mullens posted a record-setting Thursday night against the Raiders. Now, with a Monday night battle against the Giants looming, Mullens will get his chance to show it wasn\u2019t a fluke. Look for coach Kyle Shanahan to replicate what worked: quick-release throws, play-action and scheming receivers open.\n\nThree trending up\n\n1. Mullens: The Niners invested in Jimmy Garoppolo as their franchise QB, so Mullens' only has so many games left as San Francisco's starter. But Mullens could continue to hold the role over backup C.J. Beathard if his efficient and productive play continues.\n\n2. Drew Brees, Saints: He carved up a star-studded Rams defense for 346 yards and four touchdowns. As the man at the center of the league's No. 2 scoring offense, Brees is a legitimate MVP candidate.\n\n3. Matt Ryan, Falcons: He finally connected with receiver Julio Jones in the end zone, and posted 350 yards, four touchdowns and one interception against the Redskins while helping keep Atlanta in the playoff race. Over his last six games he has a 17:1 TD-to-interception ratio.\n\nThree trending down\n\n1. Sam Darnold, Jets: Already there\u2019s talk about whether Gang Green would be better off benching Darnold after a four-interception day against the Dolphins. His 14 interceptions are the most of any player in the NFL, with no one else having more than 10.\n\n2. Joe Flacco, Ravens: Baltimore keeps skidding and has lost four of five. A big reason why: Flacco just isn\u2019t making plays that he executed in the beginning of the year. The Steelers limited him to 206 yards and no scores.\n\n3. Nathan Peterman, Bills: Two of the three interceptions weren\u2019t his fault, but when the highlight of an inept loss against the Bears is that Peterman finished a game he started for the first time in his career, it\u2019s pretty bad. It\u2019s almost a shock that the Bills don\u2019t go to another option, even though their choices are limited.\n\nMore: How bad are things for Nathan Peterman? EJ Manuel is taking shots at him\n\nSeason rankings\n\n1. Brees (last week: 2): An 18:1 TD-to-interception ratio, career-high 76.3 percent completion rate and 120.6 QB rating \u2013 which just short of Aaron Rodgers\u2019 NFL record 122.5 mark from 2011 \u2013 puts Brees in the No. 1 spot for the first time all year.\n\n2. Patrick Mahomes (1), Chiefs: He finally slips out of the top spot, but the margin here is miniscule. His league-leading 29 touchdown passes and 2,901 yards could challenge single-season all-time records.\n\n3. Philip Rivers (4), Chargers: His 50 percent completion rate in a victory against the Seahawks was a season low, but Rivers remains aggressive in taking shots down the field and is on pace to eclipse his career-high QB rating by 11 points (currently at 116.5).\n\n4. Newton (5): He\u2019s on pace to surpass career bests in completion rate (67.3 percent) and QB rating (100.8) while shredding opposing defenses.\n\n5. Andrew Luck (3), Colts: With Indy on bye, Luck falls two spots.\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.", "The Buffalo Bulls destroyed Kent State on Tuesday night, 48-14, in the #MACtion matchup and advanced to a 9-1 record for the first time in school history. Pretty impressive, but maybe not as impressive as what the (presumably) lake-effect wind in western New York did to this first-quarter punt attempt.\n\nStifled at Buffalo\u2019s 49-yard line, Kent State backup quarterback Dustin Crum stepped up to punt with 41 seconds left in the first quarter. He went through the motions, kicked the ball and watched as it made a tiny amount of forward progress before the wind quickly put a stop to that.\n\nThe ball dropped at about the 52-yard line before rolling out of bounds at \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 Buffalo\u2019s 49.

That was all Mother Nature, and the punt didn\u2019t stand a chance.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, the wind speed peaked at 40 miles per hour with a top gust speed of 55 miles per hour.

Barbara Comstock, R-Va., who lost a seat dominated by the GOP since the 1950s. Comstock had drawn an \"A\" rating from the NRA, a fact not lost on David Hogg and other student advocates from Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High.

He was also part of the group's two-month, summer bus tour aimed at getting out the vote, particularly among youths.\n\nHogg said he and other protesters once walked passed Comstock's office and \"her staffers saw us and slammed the door.\"\n\nA common theme among the survivors has been outrage at what they consider hypocritical comments by NRA-backed politicians who routinely would offer their \"thoughts and prayers\" to gun violence victims and their families.\n\nHogg's sister, Lauren, spun the phrase on Twitter, \"Sending my thoughts and prayers to every NRA backed politician tonight. (;\"\n\nAnother Parkland student, Jaclyn Corin, noted on Twitter that a record 27 NRA-backed candidates were defeated Tuesday night.\n\n\"And we're not going anywhere, @NRA,\" Corin tweeted.\n\nThe news wasn't all good for the Parkland survivors. NRA-backed candidates appeared to have won hard-fought races for governor and U.S. senator.\n\n\"ThankYou to all @NRA members who got out and voted yesterday,\" the NRA tweeted. 'You are the most powerful force in American politics, and we will never stop fighting against the anti-gun elitists bent on destroying our Second Amendment freedoms.\"\n\nFred Guttenberg, the father of slain Parkland student Jamie Guttenberg, tweeted, \"Overall, this country chose to move in the direction of gun safety.\" Parkland survivor Delaney Tarr had this to add: \"So i\u2019m definitely excited to see what 2020 is gonna look like...\"\n\nSending my thoughts and prayers to every NRA backed politician tonight.

Pritzker, who bested Republican Bruce Rauner; and Nevada Democrat Steve Sisolak, who roundly defeated Republican Adam Laxalt, whose family members even campaigned against him.\n\nIn New Mexico, Democrats picked up a win with Michelle Lujan Grisham defeating Republican Steve Pearce; in Michigan, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer defeated Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette; and in Maine, Janet Mills defeated Republican Shawn Moody.\n\nIn one of the day's tightest races for governor, Wisconsin Democrat Tony Evers narrowly avoided a recount and edged out Republican incumbent Scott Walker.\n\nWalker was known for breaking unions in his state. AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka issued a pointed six-word statement after the election was over: \"Scott Walker was a national disgrace.\"\n\nIn Nevada, Sisolak, chairman of the Clark County Commission since 2013, will become the state's first Democratic governor since 1994.\n\nExperts say the winners of the 36 races for governor being decided Tuesday are bound to play a major role in the next two elections, helping their respective presidential candidates in 2020 and writing House district boundaries for the 2022 midterms.\n\nGoing into Election Day, Republicans held 33 governorships to 16 for Democrats. One independent, Gov. Bill Walker of Alaska, withdrew from his re-election race a few weeks ago.\n\nSteve Sisolak and Adam Laxalt, the Democratic and Republican nominees for Nevada governor in 2018.

Of the 16 Democratic-held seats, nine were up for election, of which four were open.\n\nIn Georgia, voters may have to wait a bit longer to see who their next governor will be.\n\nDemocrat Abrams delivered a speech to supporters early Wednesday saying she would not concede despite the apparent lead held by her Republican opponent.\n\n\"We are still on the verge of history,\" Abrams told the crowd, a reference to her candidacy as the first African-American woman running for governor.\n\nGeorgia's democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is on the campaign trail at the Macomber Recreation Building in Rincon, Ga. (Photo: JACK GRUBER, USA TODAY)\n\nAbrams' camp has for days said it would push for a runoff if neither candidate reached 50 percent of the vote.\n\nThe voting process itself became a major issue, with Kemp accusing Democrats of trying to hack into the state's voting system and Abrams charging that Kemp, who is secretary of state, was trying to suppress turnout among minority voters.\n\nA group of Georgia voters filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Atlanta to stop Kemp from presiding over the election because of concerns about his fairness.\n\nCommon Cause, a member of the Election Protection coalition, said early Tuesday that it had received reports of \u201cvoting machines going down in large numbers across the state.\u201d\n\nThe technical problems combined with large turnout to create delays of several hours for some voters.

I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nGillum was trying to become the first black governor in Florida history and the first Democratic governor in the Sunshine State since 1994.\n\nThe win in Florida was an important one for President Donald Trump, who gave DeSantis an early endorsement and visited Florida in the final week of the campaign.\n\nAt his victory party in Orlando, DeSantis thanked Trump for backing his campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to thank the president for standing by me when it wasn\u2019t necessarily the smart thing to do,\u2019\u2019 DeSantis said, according to the Orlando Sentinel. \u201cAs governor, I will fight the good fight; I will keep the faith.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Republican Governor\u2019s Association touted DeSantis' win.\n\n\u201cThe Florida governorship was the biggest prize of the night for Democrats, but despite the national media attention, and millions of dollars pumped into the state by the DGA, Tom Steyer, George Soros and other far-left groups, Florida voters rejected Gillum and his radical policies,\u201d Republican Governor\u2019s Association Executive Director Paul Bennecke said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Kevin Stitt won the governor's race in Oklahoma in another race considered a toss-up, one of dozens of races for governor that did not see a change of political parties at the helm.\n\nKansas and Oklahoma featured elections to replace term-limited Republican governors \u2013 Sam Brownback in Kansas and Mary Fallin in Oklahoma \u2013 whose experiments in severe tax cuts left their states reeling.\n\nIn Ohio, Republicans maintained state control, with Mike DeWine winning over Democrat Richard Cordray.

(AP Photo) (Photo: Jessica McGowan, Getty Images)\n\nDemocrats are not only hoping to reduce the GOP advantage in governors, but they also are hoping to cut into the large advantage the Republicans have in state legislative seats.\n\nThe GOP holds almost 1,000 more state legislative seats than Democrats, 4,101 to 3,118, and controls about two-thirds of state legislative bodies, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Thirty-four states have one-party control of the governor's office and both legislative bodies \u2013 26 are all Republican and eight are all Democratic.\n\nAgain, the makeup of state government becomes crucial when the results of the 2020 census are used to draw new maps for the U.S. House seats in each state. Those new maps will first be used in the 2022 election.\n\nThe GOP controlled much of the map-drawing after the 2000 census, giving the party a large structural advantage, experts say. The Brennan Center for Justice estimated in a report in March that Democrats would have to win the overall vote for House seats by 11 percentage points to recapture control of the body.\n\nContributing Naples Daily News\u2019 Ana Ceballos and USA TODAY\u2019s Christal Hayes.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/midterm-elections-governors-gillum-desantis-abrams-kemp/1810897002/", "Week 10 of the NFL and fantasy football season is here and as always, we have this week\u2019s studs, duds and sleepers.\n\nMake sure to use USA TODAY Sports\u2019 rankings to help as well, and good luck!\n\nStuds\n\nQB Cam Newton, Carolina Panthers\n\nHe\u2019s been steady (two passing touchdowns in each of his past six games) and now he\u2019ll have to keep pace with the Steelers, which could lead to high volume against a team that\u2019s vulnerable against opposing passers.\n\nRB David Johnson, Arizona Cardinals\n\nThis is the Garbage Time Special: The Chiefs will do their usual thing on offense, and you can expect a whole bunch of dump-offs to Johnson against a Kansas City defense that\u2019s given up a league-high 634 receiving yards to RBs (per ESPN).\n\nWR Keenan Allen, Los Angeles Chargers\n\nIs he over a disappointing start to the season?

(Photo: Jeff Roberson, AP)\n\nFox News Channel personality Sean Hannity was a no-show on the network's midterm election night coverage.\n\nHannity had been originally listed as part of Fox News' election coverage, which was co-hosted by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. Two of Fox's other primetime hosts, Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham, were scheduled to appear, according to a press release from last week, and did so.\n\nHowever, on election eve, Hannity joined President Donald Trump on stage during a campaign event, an incident Fox News called an \"unfortunate distraction.\"\n\nFox News said in email Wednesday that Hannity explained Tuesday on his radio program that he would be at home watching the election. Hannity also said on his TV show last week that on election night, he would be \u201cdrinking heavily, depending either celebrating or in misery, one or the other.\"\n\nAs returns came in Tuesday night, media watchers had waited for a Hannity on-air appearance.

But only Carlson and Ingraham are on tonight. Hannity apparently insists this was his decision. \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) November 7, 2018\n\nHannity did chime in, however \u2013 on Twitter, where he has 3.8 million followers. There he summed up the election results just before midnight as \"a massive win\" for the president.\n\nMOST in the media are absolutely clueless-tonight was a massive win 4 DJT & the ppl he campaigned 4-remember btwn the House & Senate Obama lost 69 seats, Clinton lost 60 seats-the democrats winning the house is meaningless - stay tuned for my analysis on radio & TV. Great night. \u2014 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 7, 2018\n\nEarlier in the day, Hannity issued tweets explaining his Monday night appearance during Trump's midterm election eve campaign stop in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, to support Republican Senate candidate Josh Hawley, who defeated Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill.\n\nHannity said his onstage appearance was unplanned. \"When the POTUS invited me on stage to give a few remarks last night, I was surprised, yet honored by the president's request. This was NOT planned,\" he tweeted.\n\nWhat I said in my tweet yesterday was 100% truthful.

This was NOT planned. \u2014 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 6, 2018\n\nHannity also said he was misunderstood when he called the media covering the event \"fake news\" from the stage. \"To be clear, I was not referring to my journalist colleagues at FOX News in those remarks,\" he tweeted. \"They do amazing work day in and day out in a fair and balanced way and It is an honor to work with such great professionals.\"\n\nTo be clear, I was not referring to my journalist colleagues at FOX News in those remarks.

Buzz60's Sam Berman has the full story. Buzz60\n\nThe words black friday special offers against a black background with gold confetti. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nBlack Friday is right around the corner, but many Americans are still paying off the credit card debt they racked up over the holidays last year.\n\nAmong shoppers who charged their holiday gifts in 2017, over 1 in 4 are still paying off those credit card purchases as they head into another holiday season, according to a survey from personal finance website NerdWallet.\n\n\"It's so easy to overspend with all of the excitement and ... people forget that they will have to pay all of that debt off eventually,'' says Kimberly Palmer, personal finance expert at NerdWallet. \"We recommend setting a budget ahead of time. ... There's nothing wrong with using your credit card to buy gifts, but make sure you pay off the balance at the end of the month because credit card debt is very expensive.''\n\nDespite the debt some Americans are still grappling with, shoppers aren't putting their credit cards down just yet, with 73 percent saying they plan to use a credit card to buy presents this year \u2013 up from 58 percent in 2017.\n\nThey're also expecting it to take roughly 14 weeks on average to pay off their credit card purchases, up from the 2.3 months that it typically took to erase that debt last year.\n\nShoppers are also planning to use other methods to pay for their holiday gifts this year, with 33 percent saying they're expecting to use layaway, while 21 percent will probably use shopping loans.\n\nMore Money: The best pre-Black Friday deals you can get right now\n\nMore Money: Black Friday, Cyber Monday have best deals.

But shoppers should tread carefully, Palmer says.\n\nWhile such loans vary by the company that's issuing them, as well as the retailer that the lender is partnering with, \"you'll be paying it off in installments, and it's not always obvious what the interest rate is (and) and if there are any fees involved,'' she says, \"so you want to make sure you read all all of the fine print.''\n\nCLOSE Love or hate those seasonal Starbucks cups, they're coming and here's how to get a free reusable one.

ShopSavvy, for instance, is an app that enables shoppers to compare prices by scanning bar codes at different stores.\n\nFor those making purchases online, the browser extension Honey tells shoppers about coupons they can apply and whether they can find a lower price elsewhere, Palmer says.\n\nAnd the website camelcamelcamel.com tracks prices for Amazon users, allowing them to see how prices are trending and to get price alerts when the cost of an item goes down.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/07/many-who-used-credit-cards-buy-gifts-last-year-still-paying/1903296002/", "CLOSE MIT researchers think leaving the \"porch light\" on will help intelligent life make contact with us here on Earth. Buzz60\n\nA rendering of a laser beacon beaming from Earth. (Photo: Massachusetts Institute of Technology)\n\nResearchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggest laser technology could act like a porch light for Earth to attract aliens \u2014 if they exist.\n\nA study published in The Astrophysical Journal said creating a 1- to 2-megawatt laser focused through a telescope aimed toward space could produce a light strong enough to stand out from the energy produced by the sun.\n\nJames Clark, graduate student in MIT\u2019s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and author of the study, acknowledged creating this project would be \"challenging\" but not impossible.\n\n\"If we were to successfully close a handshake and start to communicate, we could flash a message, at a data rate of about a few hundred bits per second, which would get there in just a few years,\" Clark said in a statement.\n\nClark noted lasers of that magnitude have already been created, such as the U.S. Air Force's Airborne Laser, a defunct system for shooting down ballistic missiles. However, a telescope large enough to create a potential alien signal is not currently available.\n\nSo could humans read a signal if aliens \u2014 assuming they exist \u2014 beamed one to Earth? Researchers said it's possible with the right telescope, but would require pointing directly at the signal source to see it.\n\nClark said he hopes the study opens the door for advancements in infrared imaging techniques.\n\n\"As the infrared spectra of exoplanets are studied for traces of gases that indicate the viability of life, and as full-sky surveys attain greater coverage and become more rapid, we can be more certain that, if E.T. is phoning, we will detect it,\" said Clark.\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/11/07/lasers-could-attract-aliens-earth-mit-study-suggests/1917389002/", "Gritty, the Flyers' mascot, has won over countless fans. (Photo: Tom Mihalek, AP)\n\nPhiladelphia Flyers executive Paul Holmgren, a former hard-nosed player, once joked that the franchise had such a history of gritty players that the team should have a mascot named Gritty with \u201csandpaper hands.\u201d\n\n\"That name kind of stuck,\u201d said Joe Heller, the Flyers\u2019 vice president of marketing. \u201cWhen we got something on paper, coupled it with the name, it all started to take shape from there.\u201d\n\nWhat the Flyers ended up with is the most talked-about character in the NHL this season.\n\nMany people are buzzing about Canucks rookie Elias Pettersson, but Gritty\u2019s notoriety has extended beyond the bounds of the hockey world.\n\nThe googly-eyed, orange and fuzzy mascot debuted on Sept. 24. He has been on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" and was the subject of a skit on \"Conan.\" Gritty also was mentioned on \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\" and \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nHomemade Gritty costumes, for children, adults and dogs, were hot in and around Philadelphia on Halloween. Gritty-carved pumpkins were also in style.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t died down,\u201d said Sarah Schwab, the Flyers\u2019 director of marketing. \u201cI remember in the first couple of days after we unveiled him, it blew up. It was an onslaught. And it really hasn\u2019t slowed.\u201d\n\nMore: Fired Joel Quenneville will be the Blackhawks' gift to another team in the NHL\n\nMore: Members of Ottawa Senators apologize after video of them ripping coach, team goes public\n\nGritty videos abound on YouTube, including one in which he shows off his dance moves with the Phillie Phanatic, the Phillies' mascot.\n\nSchwab said she just received a request from an outlet that wanted Gritty to show up so they could carve his form into a block of cheese.\n\n\u201cThere was always hope that he would be well-embraced but obviously this is bigger than we would have guessed,\u201d Heller said.\n\nGritty mania started when he was born, bolstered by two unscripted falls as he skated for the first time on the Philadelphia ice. People seem to relate to his rough opening night.\n\nHeller was in the press box and noted the tumble.\n\n\u201cI said to someone, \u2018Does that look like a real fall?'\u201d Heller said. \u201cHe landed on his upper back. And then he shot someone in the back with a T-shirt cannon and he fell a second time. And I said, \u2018OK, it\u2019s him wiping out for sure.'\u201d\n\nHeller said Gritty showing \u201chis clumsy side\u201d won over fans. His Instagram and Twitter posts also have resonated. \u201cIt was the perfect storm,\u201d Heller said.\n\nThe Gritty project was a couple of years in the making, launched because Flyers officials recognized they were missing out on a marketing opportunity. Mascots are popular, usually making about 250 appearances per year.\n\nThe Flyers originally consulted David Raymond, the original Phillie Phanatic, about their desire to have a mascot. But the Flyers ended up with a design from Brian Allen of Flyland Designs.\n\nThe Flyers considered animals, a variety of creatures, monsters and fictional characters, aviation offerings and human portrayals before deciding on the 7-foot orange Gritty.\n\n\u201cWe just figured a monster-like creature defines the tough ruggedness of the team and the Philly sports landscape,\u201d Heller said.\n\nHeller said the objective was to have Gritty connect with fans as one of their own. He is supposed to be the ultimate Flyers fan, but also someone who is defensive about standing up for his city.\n\nOnly one person plays the Gritty character, but the mascot code is that the person does so in anonymity.

The next few years may look like what happened in 1874.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Nov. 6, 2018. (Photo: Zach Gibson/Getty Images)\n\nThe question of the night Tuesday was, will the new House Democratic majority primarily legislate, or investigate? Either way, they have no mandate.\n\nThe 2018 midterm election continued what has become a new American tradition of divided government. Four presidents in a row have entered office with a friendly Congress, and then seen the opposition party take over. This happened with Bill Clinton in 1994, George W. Bush in 2006, Barack Obama in 2010, and now Donald Trump.\n\nOf all the shifts, this is the least dramatic. The Tea Party election in 2010 was the strongest, where Republicans picked up 63 House seats and took control of the Senate with a gain of six. In the \u201cContract with America\u201d election in 1994, the GOP won +54 seats, and also took the Senate. Democrats won both theHouse and Senate in 2006 in an election that was widely seen as a referendum on the War in Iraq.\n\nDemocrats won't be able to get much done\n\nYet this time Democrats took the House while ceding significant ground in the Senate. And the final House total will likely be far below the most optimistic \u201cBlue Wave\u201d predictions last summer. It is definitely not a decisive referendum on President Trump, and in no way confers an opposition mandate.\n\nThe new Democratic leadership \u2014 possibly headed by Nancy Pelosi, perhaps not \u2014 may choose to focus on promoting their legislative agenda. However, Democrats showed little interest in dealing with President Trump in his first two years, even though he repeatedly reached out to them to find common ground on budget and other matters. Democrats seemed much more interested in pressing investigations of the 2016 Trump campaign and alleged \u201cRussian collusion.\u201d And though Democrats tamped down impeachment talk on the 2018 campaign trail, removing Donald Trump from the White House is likely to be issue number one among the new majority\u2019s progressive wing.\n\nMore: Forget the blue wave and behold the purple puddle\n\nElection results 2018: Bragging rights for everybody and nobody\n\nFour midterm takeaways, including how Democrats should handle Trump\n\nCongressional Democrats also face several important limitations in pursuing their legislative priorities. Some proposals, such as Medicare for All or abolishing the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency, may be popular with the Democratic base but are far too radical to gain mainstream support. Pressing too far to the left will endanger their newly-won seats which tend to be in more middle-of-the-road constituencies. Also, any meaningful legislative initiatives would have to be crafted with the knowledge that they could never become law without the cooperation of the Senate, and President Trump\u2019s signature (barring veto overrides). Most House Democrats may be completely unwilling to make the necessary compromises. We are likely to see more grandstanding than serious lawmaking, and a return of legislative gridlock.\n\nHistory indicates limits for House Democrats\n\nThe future may look like what happened in 1874, when Democrats took the House for the first time since the Civil War and began nonstop investigations of the Ulysses S. Grant administration. Democrats \u2014 especially southerners \u2014 despised Grant and sought any means to whittle him down. They were so fixated on humiliating Grant they even impeached Secretary of War William Belknap after the secretary had already resigned his cabinet post. The Republican-majority Senate failed to convict Belknap, but the investigatory onslaught from this and other cases damaged Grant politically and made a prospective third term untenable.\n\nPresident Trump can also count on the Senate to provide a useful counter-weight to House excesses. For every investigation the House comes up with the Senate can mount its own inquiry. If the House votes for impeachment on some manufactured charge, it would most likely die on the Senate floor. House moves to reconfigure the Supreme Court or remove Justice Kavanaugh would likewise fail. But radicals in the Democratic caucus may not care so long as they can make a symbolic stand, and wound President Trump politically.\n\nThe country is facing two years of intensifying political theater in the run-up to the 2020 presidential race. It will be an interesting show.\n\nJames S.

Remember to exercise, relax, cherish your loved ones and let go of anger and lost causes.\n\nIn Orlando, Florida, on Nov. 6, 2018. (Photo: John Raoux)\n\nThe split decision in the midterm elections means disappointment and elation are running high in both political parties. As a physician, I am concerned about the impact of emotions on health. Health of the voters, that is. Stress hormones including adrenaline and noradrenaline are released at a time like this and they increase heart rate and blood pressure, and increase risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nThere is also the risk of ongoing anxiety and depression, especially if your candidate lost. People transfer their hopes and passions and expectations onto their chosen politicians. There is a lot of emotional pressure tied up in the elections. Attention and expectations this year were primarily focused on the House of Representatives, which changed hands from Republican to Democratic control.\n\nThis was not unusual. The party holding the White House has traditionally lost an average of 37 House seats when a president\u2019s approval rating is below 50 percent, and President Donald Trump\u2019s is at 40 percent. Still, the House and Senate losses will take their toll on Republicans and Democrats alike.\n\nThis was a personal midterm all about Trump\n\nFor many, this election is very personal and goes beyond congressional seat charts. The more personal, the higher the emotional quotient.Women appeared to turn out in record numbers, and many have expressed anger at how the president has conducted himself. Initial exit polls suggested the same was true for young voters, Latino voters, and African-American voters, though Trump has made recent important gains with this group.\n\nThough the president isn\u2019t on the ballot, his demonstrative style helped deliver extremely high turnout and influence votes. Nearly two-thirds in an AP VoteCast survey said they were voting to express their views of him; 38 percent of voters said they were expressing opposition. But 26 percent said they were expressing their support. For them, the president\u2019s brash fearless David-versus-Goliath tweets against the media monoliths and his bold stand-up-for-America style helped to galvanize support in a much more positive way.\n\nAt a time when the economy is doing very well, political strife, intolerance and division are high and growing. This is bad for our collective health.\n\nMore: Election results 2018: Bragging rights for everybody and nobody\n\nForget the blue wave and behold the purple puddle\n\nVoters rebuke Trump, modestly. At least his vitriol will be restrained.\n\nA recent study published in Journal of American College Health found that 25 percent of over 700 college students studied at Arizona State University suffered prolonged stress and anxiety as a result of the 2016 presidential election, traumatizing these students and interfering with their close relationships.\n\nElections are important, and they are a positive expression of one of our most basic and cherished freedoms, but the results have emotional consequences. Clearly, elections can impact how we live so some amount of reaction is normal. But we can certainly do without the excess worry in terms of our health. Last year the American Psychological Association reported that 63 percent of people in the U.S. consider the future of the country a significant source of stress.\n\nDon't hang on to anger and lost political causes\n\nPart of the problem is technology. We are constantly being bombarded by cable news, internet and social media updates. One way to manage the stress is to limit exposure to the election, to disengage from your iPhone or TV and reacquaint yourself with your tried and true relaxations skills, meditation, yoga, listening to music and learning to see the political changes in the larger context of our lives.\n\nMaking sure to exercise regularly, sleep and eat properly and cherish your loved ones is never more important than at a time like this, when you feel helpless or unable to influence the larger world around you. In other words, taking control of your own life through physical activity and replacing worry with caring both decreases stress hormones and increases positive neurochemicals including serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin.\n\nIn short, continue to engage in your regular activity, and resist the tendency to keep fighting for a cause that has been lost. Accept defeat graciously (after all, you are not the candidate). Imagine what the losing candidates and their families are going through and engage your empathy and compassion. Those are positive responses and much better for your health than holding on to anger or bitterness.\n\nMarc Siegel, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and a Fox News medical correspondent, is a clinical professor of medicine and medical director of Doctor Radio at NYU Langone Medical Center.

USA TODAY\n\nZion Williamson of the Duke Blue Devils celebrates against the Kentucky Wildcats during the State Farm Champions Classic at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. (Photo: Andy Lyons, Getty Images)\n\nWhen even five-time NCAA champion coach Mike Krzyzewski is surprised at how ridiculously good his team is on opening night, it puts into perspective just how mind-blowing Duke looked in its 34-point win against Kentucky on Tuesday night\n\n\"You start four freshmen, no matter how talented they are, you never know what they're going to do in this environment against an outstanding team and great program. And they responded,\" Krzyzewski told reporters after the Champions Classic in Indianapolis.\n\nBoy did they.\n\nThe Blue Devils' elite freshmen were everything as advertised \u2013 and then some. The three-headed monster of R.J. Barrett (33 points), Zion Williamson (28 points) and Cam Reddish (22 points) combined for 83 of Duke's 118 points.\n\nBut the stat sheet only tells half the story. It was how these teenagers introduced themselves to the college basketball world. Barrett, who has ample international experience playing for Canada, got to the basket at will and used his versatility and smooth lefty stroke to shred Kentucky's defense. Williamson, a dunking folk hero before Tuesday night, proved he's more than just an athletic specimen and a pretty darn complete player \u2013 poignantly evidenced with a monstrous block and then pinpoint bounce pass to Barrett.\n\nThere was no shortage of highlight reels in the dominant performance, but it was really the pace of Tuesday night's game that proved to be the difference-maker. This team absolutely thrives in transition, forcing turnovers and getting out in the open court. That starts on defense, but it's also worth noting how cohesive this freshmen-laden group looks already in both half-court and full-court scenarios -\u2013 on Day 1. Point guard Tre Jones dished out seven assists \u2013 with no turnovers \u2013 and looks to be the ideal general to glue this team together.\n\nIn the big scheme of things, though, what does one dominant night mean? Sure the Blue Devils impressed and even surpassed the preseason hype. But they drubbed a Kentucky team that's also young and still figuring it out. That said, the way No. 1 Kansas stumbled late in its Champions Classic opener against Michigan State, it begs the question of how different the outcome would've been against a team like KU with more experience and overall weaponry than Kentucky.\n\nIn reality, Duke lost virtually every relevant player from last season and played like it brought back several All-Americans. Granted, the potential top three picks in the 2019 NBA draft on one roster will wash away the Grayson Allen era pretty quickly, but at the end of the day these are still a group of youngsters playing like veterans and showing a team chemistry that usually doesn't blossom until January or February.\n\nFab Four? Duke Blue Devils freshmen wait to be introduced as starters in player introductions before playing against the Kentucky Wildcats during the Champions Classic at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. (Photo: Brian Spurlock,USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think age makes much of a difference with this team,\u201d Reddish told USA TODAY Sports ahead of the 2018-19 tip-off. \u201cEverybody\u2019s unselfish, and our coaching staff is going to help us (mature) fast.\"\n\nEarly judgments from one glimpse of a young team usually won't forecast March net-cutting, but this Duke team is the exception. Seriously. Of all the teams that have wowed us in the past decade of the one-and-done era (John Calipari's nearly-undefeated 2014-15 Kentucky team among them), this Duke squad has a different anatomy.\n\nWith Barrett, Williamson and Barrett all around 6-7 and multidimensional, the Blue Devils can play a unique brand of position-less basketball, posing nightmarish matchup problems against any opponent. This group showed some weaknesses against Kentucky, letting its foot off the gas at points and getting into foul trouble. But not even a lack of overall depth or size (UK had plenty more Tuesday) can take away the fact that Duke has three \u2013 and maybe four players \u2013 who Coach K can give the ball to at the end of the game in crunch-time situations.\n\nThe preseason prospectus pinned this team at No. 3 in the coaches poll and No. 4 in the Associated Press poll. Suffice it to say Duke was underrated before this.\n\nSo, let's pose the question: Can Duke go undefeated in 2018-19?\n\n\"They're a very good team,\" Calipari said after Tuesday's loss. \"If they play like that, they're not losing many, if that's who they are.\"\n\nThe Blue Devils have some non-conference tests against Indiana (Nov. 27) and Texas Tech (Dec. 20) but it'd be surprising to see this team unravel before ACC play \u2013 where No. 5 Virginia leads five other top 25-ranked ACC foes.\n\nBut the short answer is yes, the possibility of an unbeaten season is worth discussing.\n\nThe hype train wasn't in full gear, so it's fully reasonable to start it now.", "", "CLOSE Dan Crenshaw clapped back at Pete Davidson after winning his race for Texas\u2019 2nd Congressional District.

Today millions of Americans headed to the polls to vote in the midterm elections that will decide what party will control the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. (Photo: Zach Gibson, Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Democrats seized control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections, ending unified Republican rule of Washington and setting the stage for confrontation with President Donald Trump when they take power in January.\n\nDemocrats are expected to leverage their new majority to wield Congress' oversight powers. They could demand Trump\u2019s tax returns, subpoena his Cabinet members and investigate suspected ties to Russia. And they can block the president\u2019s legislative priorities, whether it\u2019s funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border or curbing entitlement programs.\n\nDemocrats notched key wins in suburban districts from Virginia to Colorado to Florida, standing as a rebuke to Trump. Although the final party breakdown remained in flux as of Wednesday morning, Democrats were expected to win more than the 23 seats they need to gain control.\n\nCLOSE The election results are in and Democrats gained control of the House during the midterms. It will place a check and balance on President Trump's power and could tie up his agenda for the next couple of years. USA TODAY\n\nWith 218 seats needed for a majority, Democrats have won 219 and the Republicans 193, with winners undetermined in 23 races.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill Wednesday that women candidates led the party's charge and that the issue of health care, specifically the requirement that insurers cover those with pre-existing conditions, secured their win.\n\n\u201cHealth care was on the ballot and health care won,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nMore: Money, message and Trump: 6 lessons learned from the most tumultuous midterms in a generation\n\nMore: President Trump touts 'magic' Senate wins, ignores House losses\n\nThe new Democratic majority would work to lower the price of prescription drugs, invest in infrastructure and reduce the role of \"dark, special-interest money\" in politics, she said.\n\nShe promised oversight of the Trump administration but did not commit to investigations, saying that would be the province of committee chairs. However, she specifically noted the committees that would find topics worthy of inquiry, including Judiciary, Intelligence and especially Homeland Security.\n\nThe country should be \"shamed,\" Pelosi said, about the policy that separated immigrant children from their mothers.\n\nA leading Democratic antagonist of Trump, Rep. Adam Schiff, is poised to take over the House Intelligence Committee. He told MSNBC Tuesday night that the panel under Republicans had \"completely abdicated\" its oversight of the White House.\n\nAnother Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Eric Swalwell, outlined hearings he expected to be held.\n\n\u201cWe'll fill in the gaps on the Russia investigations,\" Swalwell told NBC News. \"The American people will see his tax returns, not because of any voyeuristic interest, but because they should know if he is corrupt. And we will look at the cashing in of access to the Oval Office and that has been concerning, and his financial entanglements overseas.\u201d\n\nTrump lashed back Wednesday, threatening to investigate Democrats.\n\nIf the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level. Two can play that game! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2018\n\nTrump also offered support for Pelosi to regain the House Speaker's gavel, although he may simply prefer her as a liberal foil to attack.\n\nIn all fairness, Nancy Pelosi deserves to be chosen Speaker of the House by the Democrats. If they give her a hard time, perhaps we will add some Republican votes. She has earned this great honor! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2018\n\nLater Wednesday, Trump said at a news conference he was sincere in his praise of Pelosi and could work with her on issues like health care.\n\n\"I give her a great deal of credit for what she's done and what she has accomplished,\" Trump said. \"Hopefully we can all work together to deliver for the American people.\"\n\nFor defeated Republicans, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a conservative ally of Trump, announced Wednesday his bid to lead the party in the House.\n\nOutgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan congratulated Democrats for taking the House and Republicans for solidifying their hold on the Senate. He noted the headwinds facing the party in power during midterm election.\n\n\"We don't need to have an election to know that we are a divided nation, and now we have a divided Washington,\" the Wisconsin Republican said in statement tweeted by his spokeswoman.\n\nSpeaker Ryan Statement On 2018 Midterm Election Results: pic.twitter.com/QWUf3BsrP7 \u2014 AshLee Strong (@AshLeeStrong) November 7, 2018\n\nFemale candidates spearheaded Democratic gains. At least 80 women had been elected to the House. Sixty-nine of the House women are Democrats, including 27 of 28 newcomers, according to a USA TODAY analysis.\n\nIn Virginia, Democrat Jennifer Wexton, a state senator, toppled incumbent GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock. Wexton held a more than 12% lead over Comstock with more than 99% of ballots counted. Comstock, branded \"Trumpstock\" by Wexton in ads, fell short in a well-to-do suburban district that has become increasingly Democratic.\n\nIn Colorado, incumbent GOP Rep. Mike Coffman lost to Democrat Jason Crow, a lawyer and combat veteran. In Florida, Democrats knocked off incumbent GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo and snagged an open seat held by longtime incumbent GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who is retiring.\n\nIn suburban Philadelphia, Democrat Mary Gay Scanlon was declared the winner in another open seat held by former GOP Rep. Pat Meehan, who resigned amid questions about accusations of misconduct toward a junior female staffer. Scanlon, a former school board member and attorney, also benefited from a court-ordered redistricting decision that made the district significantly more Democratic. She defeated former Republican prosecutor Pearl Kim in November.\n\nGOP Rep. Pete Sessions, whose district includes the wealthy Dallas suburbs, lost to Colin Allred, a civil rights attorney and former player for the NFL\u2019s Tennessee Titans in Texas\u2019 32nd District. Sessions is chairman of the powerful Rules Committee and led the National Republican Congressional Committee when it made historic gains in 2010. He had not faced a competitive race in years.\n\nWhile many of the Republicans who were knocked off were centrists, a handful of conservatives in GOP districts once thought to be safe found they would not be returning to Washington next year.\n\nIn Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District, Democratic former CIA officer Abigail Spanberger scored a major upset, ousting conservative GOP Rep. Dave Brat in a race that was surprisingly competitive for a district that has been reliably red. Brat knows about upsets: In 2014, he defeated then-GOP Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the Republican primary. President Donald Trump carried the district by 7 percentage points in 2016.\n\nDemocrats gained a seat in Iowa\u2019s 1st Congressional District, a blue-collar swing seat now represented by arch conservative GOP Rep. Rod Blum and carried by Trump by 3 percentage points in 2016. Democrat Abby Finkenauer, a 29-year-old state representative, is slated to become the first woman ever elected to the House from Iowa.\n\nRep. Claudia Tenney fell to Anthony Brindisi, a New York state assemblyman, in New York\u2019s 22nd District. Tenney had aligned herself closely with the president, who won the district by more than 15 points in 2016.\n\nThere was at least one pickup for Republicans. Minnesota\u2019s 8th District elected Republican Pete Stauber, a retired police commander, former professional hockey player and county commissioner. He beat Democrat Joe Radinovich, who served in the Minnesota House. (In Minnesota, the Democrats are the Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Party.)\n\nTwo indicted Republicans, Californian Duncan Hunter and New York state\u2019s Chris Collins, won their re-election bids.\n\nHunter and his wife, Margaret, face a 60-count federal indictment alleging conspiracy, wire fraud and misspending and falsification of campaign finance records. Collins is accused of insider trading. Party leaders asked him to withdraw, but he stayed in the race.\n\nRepublicans fended off stiff challenges in some more conservative districts. In Kentucky, GOP Rep. Andy Barr defeated Democrat and former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath. The district, which includes Lexington and Frankfurt, shouldn\u2019t have been competitive: Trump won it by 15 percentage points in 2016. But McGrath turned it into a tight race, attracting national attention with viral TV ads, including one that showcased her 89 combat missions. The Associated Press declared Barr the winner.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/07/election-results-2018-house-democrats/1897848002/", "Two orders of ribs with sweet potato fries, tater tots and cole slaw. (Photo: Calvin Kennedy Cochran)\n\nThe scene: With its garage-style feel, high ceilings and exposed ductwork, Feast is a near-perfect physical rendition of a classic barbecue joint, from the old brick building to the order-at-the-counter layout to the metal trays food is served on. It absolutely looks the part, but the four-year-old Louisville flagship location goes beyond standard barbecue-shack fare with its lengthy array of craft beer taps, eccentric menu items, flat-screen TVs, and location in trendy NuLu, the up-and-coming dining and nightlife section of the city\u2019s fast growing downtown. The very first Feast BBQ was just across the border in Indiana, but was too small for its burgeoning popularity and closed, supplanted by this large and very popular spot, while a second new one opened in suburban Jeffersontown.\n\nThere is usually a line for food (and drink, as you order both at the front counters), especially on busy Friday and Saturday nights, but it moves quickly, and the restaurant holds a lot of diners at large picnic-style tables. It\u2019s got an energetic sort of mess-hall feel, quite lively, and in addition to the array of craft draughts, signature bourbon slushies and deep bourbon list (like every restaurant in Louisville, the capital of the American whiskey trade), the neighborhood is packed with craft cocktail bars and modern speakeasies. All of this is convenient to the major downtown hotels, making Feast and all of NuLu popular with both locals and tourists alike.\n\nReason to visit: Fried pickles, pork cakes, loaded tots, ribs, fried bread pudding, bourbon slushies.\n\nThe food: The brilliance of Feast is to take the traditional smoked meats and reimagine them in all sorts of fun and tasty ways with a distinctive Southern flair. While it does serve the standards \u2013 pulled pork, beef brisket, ribs and chicken \u2013 these main courses, usually the focused attraction of a barbecue place, are just a small part of the appeal here. The smoked meats are quite good, don\u2019t get me wrong, but what really elevates the creative menu is the fantastic side dishes, appetizers and different ways in which the meats are leveraged. They are sold by the pound, as sandwiches, as plates with sides, and folded into tacos, starters and even salads. There is even smoked tofu as an alternative to the four meats.\n\nPerhaps the dish Feast is most famous for locally is its \u201cloaded tots,\u201d a heaping array of crisp tater tots piled with creamy cole slaw, chopped green onions, house-made barbecue sauce, and your choice of pulled pork, chopped chicken, smoked tofu or beef brisket. It\u2019s a delicious, addictive Southern take on poutine.\n\nBut the dish that stunned me had no meat at all \u2013 the fried pickles are easily the best I have ever tasted, and I\u2019ve tasted a lot. Fried pickles have become trendy in in recent years but they are rarely notable, often slimy spears where the coating comes off with a bite. Not here. They go the pickle chip route, and the breading is perfect, coherent and crispy, served with a ranch dressing dip that has been augmented with Mexican cotija cheese and fresh cilantro. I would go back to Feast just for these, and I would not go to Feast without trying them. In addition to a featured appetizer, the pickles are also included in the BBQ Salad, a \u201csalad\u201d only in the sense that there is some lettuce under the pulled pork, pickles, onions and two types of barbecue sauce, the standard tomato-based and a more Carolina-style smoky mustard dressing.\n\nAnother unexpected signature is pork cakes, a unique dish that had the delicate texture and appearance of crab cakes, made with smoked pork, sorghum and green onions, and topped with creamy slaw. These were great, and I\u2019ve not seen anything quite like them anyplace else. The only dish I tried that I would skip next time was the burgoo, a traditional Kentucky meat stew that is made here with a mix of the barbecue meats and corn, potatoes, lima beans and more. It\u2019s good, and tastes very fresh with real chunks of meat, but doesn\u2019t do anything to showcase the smoked meats, which you are better off just having straight-up or in one of the other fun dishes. Among the smoked meat offerings, the brisket was quite good, and the ribs really stood out, with a fantastic brown sugar and spice dry rub that gives it a great crust that contrasts the tender meat within and makes the flavor jump out in your mouth. Even the side dishes, standards like collard greens and mac and cheese, are quite good.\n\nAll that would be more than enough, but Feast also specializes in creative tacos, a whole \u2018nother meal worth of interesting choices. Tacos come in many permutations based on two basic styles: Mexican (cotija cheese, cabbage, pickled red onion, cilantro, lime juice and crema) or American (cole slaw, green onions and barbecue sauce), all with your choice of pork, chicken, brisket or tofu. The tacos are tasty, substantial and cheap, and because they are sold individually, they make a great app or side, while two (three for big appetites) easily serve as a main course, and you can mix or match.\n\nEveryone in my group loved the signature house cocktail, the bourbon slushie, also served in a special daily second flavor (s\u2019mores during my visit). And it would be a big omission not to mention the incredible dessert option of fried bread pudding cubes, tossed in powdered sugar and served with a white chocolate and bourbon dipping sauce \u2013 awesome! Whether it\u2019s a serious barbecue meal, a place to dine before visiting the city\u2019s famous Churchill Downs racetrack, or a social group food-and-drink outing while watching a football game on one of the flat-screens, Feast will satisfy just about any appetite, and is also very reasonably priced.\n\nPilgrimage-worthy?: No, but it is a great choice for both barbecue devotees and everyone else.\n\nRating: Yum! (Scale: Blah, OK, Mmmm, Yum!, OMG!)\n\nPrice: $-$$ ($ cheap, $$ moderate, $$$ expensive)\n\nDetails: 909 E.

(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNAPLES, Italy (AP) \u2014 There wasn't a hint of protest from Gianluigi Buffon this time.\n\nReturning to the Champions League following his three-match ban for comments about the referee last season, Buffon immediately realized there was no point in arguing when Napoli was awarded a penalty that turned out to be the equalizer in a 1-1 draw Tuesday.\n\nBuffon and Paris Saint-Germain teammate Thiago Silva had just sandwiched Napoli forward Jose Callejon.\n\n\"I didn't protest when the penalty was assigned because I usually don't when it's not a controversial play,\" Buffon said. \"Whereas in Madrid I thought I was treated unfairly \u2014 not for the ban \u2014 but for the incredible red card I was shown.\"\n\nWhile Buffon was still at Juventus, he was sent off at the end of a quarterfinal loss to eventual champion Real Madrid for protesting an injury-time penalty. Buffon then told reporters that referee Michael Oliver had \"a garbage bag for a heart.\"\n\nBuffon's behavior in Naples was impeccable, especially considering that he was showered with loud boos and whistles upon each touch.\n\nThe fans at the San Paolo Stadium still consider Buffon an enemy after he spent nearly two decades at rival Juventus.\n\n\"I've never seen anyone come to Napoli and play easily here,\" Buffon said. \"As I told my teammates, I've had a pretty long career and I've won at Napoli twice, so it's pretty complicated.\"\n\nBuffon's recent transfer to PSG was surprising amid expectations that he would retire at the end of last season.\n\nBut at the age of 40, Buffon showed over a short span of the second half that he's still one of the world's best goalkeepers with an array of spectacular saves to deny Napoli's darting forwards Dries Mertens and Lorenzo Insigne.\n\nBefore Insigne converted the penalty, Buffon smiled at his former Italy teammate.\n\n\"I wasn't able to distract him,\" Buffon said. \"But I'm happy I was able to do my part for the squad in such a delicate match.\"\n\nInsigne noted that he has practiced countless penalties against Buffon in Italy training sessions.\n\n\"Buffon knows Insigne well, but then Insigne knows Buffon, too,\" said Napoli coach Carlo Ancelotti, who formerly managed PSG. \"Buffon was in great shape this evening, as always.\"\n\nK2 DEFENSE\n\nMatch by match, Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly is developing into one of the world's top defenders.\n\nAfter helping keep Liverpool strikers Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane scoreless last month, Koulibaly almost single-handedly negated powerful PSG striker Kylian Mbappe in the first half.\n\nNear the half-hour mark, the 27-year-old Senegal international, who is nicknamed \"K2,\" stopped an onrushing Mbappe dead in his tracks to earn a loud round of applause.\n\nIt wasn't until Mbappe rounded Nikola Maksimovic and provided the cross for Juan Bernat's opener in first-half added time that the France standout finally made his mark.\n\nIN-FORM INSIGNE\n\nInsigne has scored five goals in his last six Champions League matches and was cool under pressure to convert the equalizing penalty.\n\nWhile Buffon guessed right when he leaped to his right post, Insigne deposited his shot perfectly into the corner before the goalkeeper could get there.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nAndrew Dampf on Twitter: www.twitter.com/asdampf\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nLSU quarterback Joe Burrow tries to avoid a sack by Alabama defensive lineman Raekwon Davis during their game on Nov. 3, 2018. (Photo: Gregory Shamus, Getty Images)\n\nThat No. 7 LSU remains ahead of No. 8 Washington State in this week\u2019s College Football Playoff rankings is the latest referendum on the SEC\u2019s hopes of again placing two teams in the national semifinals.\n\nWashington State is the lone challenger from the Pac-12, which is otherwise a trash heap of would-be contenders, while two-loss LSU is the third SEC team in the ranking\u2019s top seven, two spots behind No. 5 Georgia. LSU has no chance to win its own division, let alone securing a spot in a semifinal; still, the committee has reinforced its affection for the SEC by not strongly docking the Tigers for last weekend\u2019s 29-0 loss to No. 1 Alabama.\n\nIt\u2019s a statement about how the committee views the SEC \u2013 as not just the best conference in the country but the best conference by a wide swatch of space over its closest rival, whether that\u2019s the Big Ten or the Big 12.\n\nBut it\u2019s not the only example. Kentucky is down just two spots, to No. 11, after being revealed as a championship pretender in a loss to Georgia. Florida stuck in the top 15 despite an ugly loss Missouri, which was previously winless in SEC play.\n\nThis week\u2019s rankings even saw the return of Auburn, which slotted in at No. 24 after a nice win against Texas A&M. The three-loss Tigers don\u2019t have the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for a spot in the top 25.\n\nYou can see it in the rankings: Once again, the committee believes the SEC has earned the benefit of the doubt. With chaos almost inevitably on the horizon, the league has positioned itself to take advantage.\n\nHere\u2019s what the committee got right and wrong in this week\u2019s rankings:\n\nRight\n\n- No. 3 Notre Dame stayed of No. 4 Michigan. You\u2019d think this would be a no-brainer, since the Irish topped the Wolverines in the season opener and have remained unbeaten. There was still some thought that the committee could value Michigan\u2019s otherwise strong record and recent play to move ahead of the Irish and claim third in this week\u2019s rankings.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen, which provides two takeaways. One, this should solidify the belief that Notre Dame is in if undefeated; that\u2019s an absolute given. From Michigan\u2019s perspective, however, staying a spot ahead of Georgia despite the Bulldogs\u2019 win against Kentucky supports the idea that Michigan is in the field if 12-1 and owners of wins against Ohio State and in the Big Ten title game.\n\n- There was some respect for the ACC. This league has been an afterthought on a national level due to Clemson\u2019s dominance. But the ACC is a pretty good conference, believe it or not, and the committee recognized that fact by placing another three teams in the top 20.\n\nNo. 13 Syracuse has a major date coming up against Notre Dame, with a win likely sending the Orange to a New Year\u2019s Six bowl. Having North Carolina State at No. 14 might be a stretch \u2013 the Wolfpack should be swapped with No. 17 Boston College, which should give Clemson a game in Saturday\u2019s key ACC matchup.\n\nWrong\n\n- Central Florida shouldn\u2019t be behind two-loss SEC teams. Not both of them, at least. LSU probably has a case to stay ahead of the No. 12 Knights thanks to what is still a nice list of wins \u2013 particularly given how the committee feels about teams such as Mississippi State and Auburn. That UCF remained behind Kentucky is a little harder to understand.\n\nIt\u2019s not the Wildcats don\u2019t have strong wins: Mississippi State\u2019s a good one, and topping Florida is still noteworthy despite the Gators\u2019 recent nosedive. It\u2019s that the Wildcats haven\u2019t looked the part for the better part of a month, a stretch that includes the 17-point loss to the Bulldogs and ugly wins against Vanderbilt and Missouri. There might be enough there to justify being ahead of undefeated UCF.\n\nBut not in the eyes of the selection committee, which was clearly unimpressed by the Knights' 52-40 shootout win against Temple.\n\n\"When you watched their game last week you could see the defense struggle,\" said selection committee chairman Rob Mullens. That is a piece of it. Strong offense, struggling on defense.\"\n\n- These teams should\u2019ve been in. Instead of Washington or Auburn, the committee should\u2019ve looked at Utah State, Army and even Oregon. The Ducks beat the Huskies, which should matter, and outside of last month\u2019s loss to Arizona have looked the part of a top 25 team. Army doesn\u2019t have great wins, but seven wins and a very competitive loss to Oklahoma provides a strong r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nAnd Utah State has absolutely every reason to be ahead of those two teams from the Power Five. The Aggies lost in the opener, by a touchdown to No. 18 Michigan State, and has since rolled off eight wins in a row with seven coming by at least two possessions.

(Photo: Gregory Shamus, Getty Images)\n\nThat No. 7 LSU remains ahead of No. 8 Washington State in this week\u2019s College Football Playoff rankings is the latest referendum on the SEC\u2019s hopes of again placing two teams in the national semifinals.\n\nWashington State is the lone challenger from the Pac-12, which is otherwise a trash heap of would-be contenders, while two-loss LSU is the third SEC team in the ranking\u2019s top seven, two spots behind No. 5 Georgia. LSU has no chance to win its own division, let alone securing a spot in a semifinal; still, the committee has reinforced its affection for the SEC by not strongly docking the Tigers for last weekend\u2019s 29-0 loss to No. 1 Alabama.\n\nIt\u2019s a statement about how the committee views the SEC \u2013 as not just the best conference in the country but the best conference by a wide swatch of space over its closest rival, whether that\u2019s the Big Ten or the Big 12.\n\nBut it\u2019s not the only example. Kentucky is down just two spots, to No. 11, after being revealed as a championship pretender in a loss to Georgia. Florida stuck in the top 15 despite an ugly loss Missouri, which was previously winless in SEC play.\n\nThis week\u2019s rankings even saw the return of Auburn, which slotted in at No. 24 after a nice win against Texas A&M. The three-loss Tigers don\u2019t have the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for a spot in the top 25.\n\nYou can see it in the rankings: Once again, the committee believes the SEC has earned the benefit of the doubt. With chaos almost inevitably on the horizon, the league has positioned itself to take advantage.\n\nHere\u2019s what the committee got right and wrong in this week\u2019s rankings:\n\nRight\n\n- No. 3 Notre Dame stayed of No. 4 Michigan. You\u2019d think this would be a no-brainer, since the Irish topped the Wolverines in the season opener and have remained unbeaten. There was still some thought that the committee could value Michigan\u2019s otherwise strong record and recent play to move ahead of the Irish and claim third in this week\u2019s rankings.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen, which provides two takeaways. One, this should solidify the belief that Notre Dame is in if undefeated; that\u2019s an absolute given. From Michigan\u2019s perspective, however, staying a spot ahead of Georgia despite the Bulldogs\u2019 win against Kentucky supports the idea that Michigan is in the field if 12-1 and owners of wins against Ohio State and in the Big Ten title game.\n\n- There was some respect for the ACC. This league has been an afterthought on a national level due to Clemson\u2019s dominance. But the ACC is a pretty good conference, believe it or not, and the committee recognized that fact by placing another three teams in the top 20.\n\nNo. 13 Syracuse has a major date coming up against Notre Dame, with a win likely sending the Orange to a New Year\u2019s Six bowl. Having North Carolina State at No. 14 might be a stretch \u2013 the Wolfpack should be swapped with No. 17 Boston College, which should give Clemson a game in Saturday\u2019s key ACC matchup.\n\nWrong\n\n- Central Florida shouldn\u2019t be behind two-loss SEC teams. Not both of them, at least. LSU probably has a case to stay ahead of the No. 12 Knights thanks to what is still a nice list of wins \u2013 particularly given how the committee feels about teams such as Mississippi State and Auburn. That UCF remained behind Kentucky is a little harder to understand.\n\nIt\u2019s not the Wildcats don\u2019t have strong wins: Mississippi State\u2019s a good one, and topping Florida is still noteworthy despite the Gators\u2019 recent nosedive. It\u2019s that the Wildcats haven\u2019t looked the part for the better part of a month, a stretch that includes the 17-point loss to the Bulldogs and ugly wins against Vanderbilt and Missouri. There might be enough there to justify being ahead of undefeated UCF.\n\nBut not in the eyes of the selection committee, which was clearly unimpressed by the Knights' 52-40 shootout win against Temple.\n\n\"When you watched their game last week you could see the defense struggle,\" said selection committee chairman Rob Mullens. That is a piece of it. Strong offense, struggling on defense.\"\n\n- These teams should\u2019ve been in. Instead of Washington or Auburn, the committee should\u2019ve looked at Utah State, Army and even Oregon. The Ducks beat the Huskies, which should matter, and outside of last month\u2019s loss to Arizona have looked the part of a top 25 team. Army doesn\u2019t have great wins, but seven wins and a very competitive loss to Oklahoma provides a strong r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nAnd Utah State has absolutely every reason to be ahead of those two teams from the Power Five. The Aggies lost in the opener, by a touchdown to No. 18 Michigan State, and has since rolled off eight wins in a row with seven coming by at least two possessions. USU should join No. 23 Fresno State in giving the Mountain West two teams in the rankings.", "", "Airlines must fill seats during the lull between the holidays, so they drop prices. A lot. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nI just looked up the cost of airfare for New York to Reno during Thanksgiving and saw round-trip prices in the mid-$600s. Then I looked at prices for the same flights in the first week of December and found a bargain: $202 round-trip.\n\nWelcome to the final deal zone of 2018.\n\nWhat is a deal zone?\n\nDeals zones are cheap times to fly. Do not wait to buy a deal zone fare until the window is upon you \u2013 even deal zones require some lead time for the purchase, at least a couple of weeks before takeoff. For this final deal zone of 2018, you can shop right now.\n\nThis latest deal zone is neatly sandwiched between the end of the late November Thanksgiving travel period and before the start of the December rush for Christmas and New Year\u2019s. The specific dates can vary a little depending on where you live and where you\u2019re going, but most will be in the zone from Nov. 28 through Dec. 15.\n\nGreat savings abound\n\nThe savings can be terrific. That\u2019s because airlines must fill seats during the lull between the holidays, so they drop prices. A lot. Here are some examples of round-trip, deal zone prices found earlier this week:\n\n\u2022 Atlanta-Philadelphia, $101\n\n\u2022 Chicago-Fort Lauderdale, $101\n\n\u2022 Dallas-Denver, $83\n\n\u2022 Los Angeles-Cleveland, $101\n\nAnd yes, deal zones work in Europe, too.\n\n\u2022 Boston-Dublin, $306\n\n\u2022 New York-Stockholm, $286\n\n\u2022 San Francisco-London, $395\n\nHow to find these deals\n\nThe best way is with a deal-searching tool that seeks the best fares during specific months or seasons. There are several out there; if you use the one on Farecompare.com, set the travel period to \u201cfall\u201d and you\u2019ll find lots of deals. Or just check fares on dates that are convenient for you, but always use a comparison site because your favorite airline will not always have the best price.\n\nPrepare yourself to be as flexible a flyer as possible. For example, the biggest bargains may involve connecting flights with long layovers (though this was not the case in the examples above). Or you might have to fly weekdays instead of weekends. In many cases, this flexibility will bring you amazing savings.\n\nFareCompare CEO Rick Seaney is an airline industry insider and top media air travel resource.

The rally was broad, with the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rising 2.1 percent and the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite gaining 2.6 percent.\n\nWall Street woke up to a partisan power split in Congress and a likely period of legislative gridlock after the Democrats regained control of the House, ending two years of Republican control of both branches of Congress under Republican President Donald Trump. The GOP retained its majority in the Senate.\n\nThe vote result, however, was widely expected by investors. The new Capitol Hill alignment that will take effect in January isn't viewed as a major game-changer for the economy or markets, largely because the split Congress makes it unlikely that legislation would undo parts of President Trump's agenda \u2013 such as large tax cuts and deregulation of business.\n\nInvestors also avoided the most-feared Wall Street outcome, a so-called \"blue wave,\" or Democratic sweep of both chambers of Congress. That could have put the president's economic policies under assault and boosted the odds of a Democratic House pushing for Trump's impeachment.\n\n\"Everything played out according to script,\" Stephen Innes, head of Asia trading at Oanda, told USA TODAY. \"The Trump agenda is not in serious jeopardy.\"\n\nStill, the House will likely make things tough on Trump and move to block his agenda, adds Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com\n\n\"House Democrats will turn up the pressure on President Trump through investigations and oversight,\" Hamrick said.\n\nLegislative gridlock has historically been good for financial markets. In fact, in years with a Republican president and a Republican-controlled Senate and Democrat-run House in place, the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index has posted average gains of 10.8 percent, according to data from Strategas Research Partners.\n\n\"A split Congress means that gridlock is more likely, and that's been fine for markets in the past,\" says Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones.\n\nIn the past, after the uncertainty around the midterm elections has been eliminated after the vote, stocks have performed well, posting higher returns a year after every midterm election since World War II. The Dow also has posted average gains of 4 percent in the fourth quarter of midterm election years going back to 1896, data from LPL Research show.\n\nA Democrat-controlled Congress would have been greeted less well by investors, as it would have increased concerns about the possible rollback of Trump-driven policies, adds David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.\n\n\"The outcome of the elections was not a tail risk event,\" Joy says, referring to a surprise outcome similar to the Brexit vote in 2016 that rocked markets. \"The markets were afraid there would be a blue wave, which would have resulted in a government that was perceived as less business friendly.\"\n\nThe stock market also tends to rise once the uncertainty of the election is out of the way, allowing investors to return their focus to things such as the outlook for the economy and corporate earnings, adds Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust.\n\n\"The unknown is behind us,\" Quinlan says. \"There were no surprises so investors can refocus on business fundamentals, which are solid and supportive of rising equity prices.\"\n\nWall Street's focus now will shift to existing headwinds, such as U.S. and China trade tensions and the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike plans, Quinlan says.\n\nPolitical gridlock, Quinlan adds, could result in less fiscal stimulus from the federal government, which means there is \"less risk\" of the U.S. economy overheating, which could lead to less aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.\n\nMore Money: Midterm election not seen rocking 401(k) plans, but surprise outcome could roil stocks\n\nMore Money: Duncan Hines recalls 2.4 million boxes of cake mix for potential salmonella risk\n\nMore Money: Status update: Facebook catches pop-up fever, opening first retail shop in 9 Macy's stores\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/07/midterm-elections-2018-stock-market-rises/1911388002/", "CLOSE A woman who admitted to falsely claiming she was raped \"several times\" by Brett Kavanaugh could now face serious repercussions.

David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, co-chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee.\n\nDemocrats said their targets range from accused ethical lapses by members of the Cabinet to allegations that Trump's campaign worked with Russian hackers to influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn his NBC interview, Swalwell said, \"We will look at the cashing in of access to the Oval Office and that has been concerning and his financial entanglements overseas.\u201d\n\nTrumpo was not specific about his threat to counter-investigate the Democrats. In recent weeks, he has accused them of improperly leaking information about then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nSome critics said Trump's threat doesn't bode well for working together on legislation.\n\nMatthew Miller, a spokesman for the Justice Department under President Barack Obama, noted that Trump is thinking of dismissing Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Amid those reports, Miller tweeted: \"Trump threatens criminal investigations of his political critics. Things are going just as expected.\"\n\nThe president didn't directly address the outcome that represents a seismic shift in national politics: the Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives. Democrats picked up dozens of seats on Tuesday, including many in districts Trump won in 2016.\n\nInstead, on Twitter, he played up Republican victories.\n\nTrump posted a quote from supporter and writer Ben Stein suggesting the results showed the president has \"magic coming out of his ears\" because the GOP expanded its Senate majority by winning races in Indiana, North Dakota and Missouri.\n\nMinutes later, Trump tweeted a quote he evidently heard from a Fox Business Network anchor indicating his standing with Republicans in Congress should increase because of the blitz of campaigning he conducted in the run-up to Tuesday's election. The anchor wrote that successful Republicans owed Trump their careers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only been 5 times in the last 105 years that an incumbent President has won seats in the Senate in the off year election.

He also spoke with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.\n\nIn something of a backhanded compliment, Trump tweeted that Pelosi deserves to be chosen House Speaker by her fellow Democrats, some of whom have criticized her leadership. \"If they give her a hard time, perhaps we will add some Republican votes,\" Trump said. \"She has earned this great honor!\"\n\nThe president also called to congratulate incoming Republican senators, including Rick Scott of Florida, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and Josh Hawley of Missouri.\n\nTrump officials said they have prepared for the prospect of a Democratic House. One strategy, they said, would be to focus on items handled by the Republican-run Senate, a list that includes trade agreements and judicial nominations.\n\nPresidential counselor Kellyanne Conway said Trump managed to avoid an Obama-like \"shellacking,\" and now he will try to work with Democrats on issues of common interest like immigration and infrastructure.\n\nAs for House investigations of Trump and his administration, Conway said they will deal with them as they come up.\n\nShe also hinted at legal challenges to House subpoenas.\n\nAsked what would happen, for example, if the House Democrats seek Trump\u2019s tax returns, Conway said: \u201cWe\u2019ll talk to the lawyers about that \u2013 we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nMore: Elections 2018 US Senate and House race results\n\nMore: Election results: Several races undecided as GOP keeps Senate and Democrats take House\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/07/election-results-donald-trump/1891116002/", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "30 million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes, with millions more at risk for developing it.\n\nDiabetes affects more than 30.3 million Americans, making it one of the top conditions affecting Americans' overall health. (Photo: georgeclerk, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nDiabetes has a greater health impact on Americans than heart disease, substance use disorder or COPD, with 30.3 million Americans diagnosed with the illness and many more who are at risk for developing it.i According to the Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) Health IndexSM, people with diabetes on average lose seven years of healthy life. Though these facts are concerning for those with the disease, everyone \u2013 diagnosed or not \u2013 should pay attention to how it might affect us all.\n\n\u201cThe health and economic impact of diabetes for the United States cannot be overemphasized,\u201d said Trent Haywood, M.D., J.D., senior vice president and chief medical officer for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (BCBS), which published a first of its-kind metric for measuring America\u2019s Health.\n\nThe BCBS Health Index details the health impact of 200 diseases and found diabetes is one of the top 10 conditions impacting Americans. Here are five important takeaways from the data analysis \u2014 and what those numbers mean for us.\n\n1 in 3 Americans are at high risk\n\nIn addition to the 30.3 million Americans who have been diagnosed with diabetes, there are another 84.1 million who have pre-diabetes, meaning their blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not yet high enough to be considered Type 2 diabetes.ii Even more alarming, there are approximately 7.1 million Americans who have diabetes, but don\u2019t know it.iii\n\nThese numbers speak to a significant health crisis, with implications extending beyond the disease itself and spreading into other economic, health and social factors of American life.\n\n\u201cGlobally, the overall impact makes the United States workforce less competitive,\u201d Haywood said. \u201cLocally, it creates disproportional impact on communities that are hardest hit by the high prevalence rates.\u201d\n\nDiabetes is also linked to additional health and risk factors which Haywood says should be acknowledged.\n\n\u201cWe must understand all of the complicating factors including an increase in stroke, heart attack and disabilities and the impact of those conditions on our families and communities.\u201d\n\nThe health impact of diabetes grew fastest for young people; obesity is also high among this group. Experts suggest lifestyle and diet changes to help mitigate these trends. (Photo: mapodile, Getty Images)\n\nRates are rising among young people\n\nData from the BCBS Health Index shows that, between 2013 and 2015, the health impact of diabetes grew fastest for insured members between the ages of 18 and 34. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, rates for obesity within this age group also rose by more than 30% between 2001 and 2015, meaning more young people are in danger of developing diabetes now or in the future. The growing pool of young, at-risk Americans creates troubling implications for the future, when the potential spread of diabetes could mean significant costs for medical treatment and a decline in quality of life for millions.\n\nFortunately, for older age groups the health impact of diabetes has not grown significantly and in some cases even fell. For insured members between the ages of 55 and 64, the health impact of diabetes fell almost 2% during the same period that it rose for younger Americans.\n\nCosts are on the rise, too\n\nDiabetes costs over $12.1B annually to treat and impacts 6.8% of the commercially insured. One of the cost drivers is the rising cost of insulin, a hormone used to manage diabetes. BCBS data shows the cost of these drugs increased 137% from 2010-2017. The issue is further complicated by the fact that four commonly prescribed insulins \u2014 Lantus, Novolog, Levemir and Humalog \u2014 have proven difficult to replace with more affordable generic versions because of their complex formulas, part of an ongoing rise in Branded Patent Protected prescription drugs, as tracked by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Health of America Report.\n\n\u201cIt is not sustainable,\u201d Haywood said of the continued increase in prices. \u201cThe percentage of Americans with obesity, pre-diabetes and diabetes creates pressures on both the healthcare system and the economic system.\u201d\n\nWhere you live might increase your risk\n\nOne of the key findings in the BCBS Health Index examination of diabetes is the disease\u2019s comparatively high impact on communities in the Southeast and Central South regions of the United States, where the number of people with diabetes is about 50% higher than the national average. According to Haywood, this might be attributed to the availability of healthy foods.\n\n\u201cOften, Americans with diabetes are living in a \u201cnutritional desert\u201d with poor access to healthy food options which increases the overall negative health impact,\u201d He said.\n\nThough nutrition certainly plays a role, the overall picture is a bit more complicated due to factors beyond food intake. \u201cThe social and cultural components of diabetes combined with hereditary risk creates substantially disproportional impact for certain geographic regions.\u201d\n\nHaywood suggests approaching these \u201cthrough community interventions and programs that are equally important to achieve better health outcomes.\u201d\n\nPrevention is the best medicine\n\nDespite the factors that have exacerbated the spread of diabetes, experts agree that there is a simple answer to keep it from getting worse. The single most effective way to combat the epidemic of diabetes facing Americans is to keep people from getting it in the first place, and with the right education and awareness, rates should go down. After all, lowering your risk can be as simple as replacing one meal a day with a healthy alternative and increasing your exercise regimen.\n\n\u201cThe diabetes epidemic is having an economic impact on individuals, families and on the health of the country,\u201d Haywood said. \u201cIt is critical to take measures now.\u201d\n\nAll trademarks and brands identified above are the property of their respective owners, which are in no way associated or affiliated with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.

And that, combined with changes that limit or repeal many itemized deductions, means that starting in 2018 more than 90 percent of taxpayers will claim the standard deduction, according to the firm Wolters Kluwer.\n\nFor those individuals who are considering the standard deduction instead of itemizing, consider bunching your charitable contributions into alternate years if it will enable you to take the standard deduction one year and itemize the next.\n\n\u201cIf you do not want to give the money to charity at one time, contribute to a donor-advised fund and then make the distributions to charity over time,\u201d says Lisa Featherngill, the head of legacy and wealth planning at Abbot Downing in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\n\nGift your money\n\nYear-end is also a great time to make annual exclusion gifts, says Westley. \u201cFor those looking to reduce their estate tax exposure, individuals can give up to $15,000 to an unlimited number of beneficiaries per year without decreasing their lifetime estate tax exclusion amount or paying a gift tax,\u201d he says. \u201cThese (and other) planning opportunities will be lost once the year ends and should be top of mind to review now.\u201d\n\nGot qualified business income?\n\nThe new 20 percent deduction from qualified business income for pass-through entities is a significant potential tax benefit for business owners, says Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst with Wolters Kluwer. \u201cBut it can be complicated to figure out how to maximize the deduction,\u201d he says.\n\nLuscombe\u2019s advice: Work with a trusted tax adviser to maximize eligibility for the 20 percent deduction.\n\nTactics based on your bracket\n\nLeonard Wright, a wealth management adviser at Northwestern Mutual, says there are specific steps to take based on your tax rate.\n\n\u201cIf your tax rate is high, consider boosting your and your spouse's 401(k) contributions and/or your spouse's IRA contributions,\u201d he says. \u201cbut if you are in a loss position, or a very low tax bracket, consider converting IRA or 401(k) assets to a Roth IRA.\u201d\n\nAlso, consider contributing to a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA if able. \u201cEspecially for anyone who is early on in their career and in a lower tax bracket,\u201d Wright says.\n\nRobert Powell is the editor of TheStreet\u2019s Retirement Daily www.retirement.thestreet.com and contributes regularly to USA TODAY.

(AP Photo/Duane Burleson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 A Detroit Red Wings home game looks and sounds a little like a memorial these days.\n\nThe lights are dimmed as images of the franchise's glorious past flash digitally onto the ice before the puck drops, reminding the relative few fans in the stands how good things used to be. And, they were good. Really good.\n\nDetroit's 11 Stanley Cup banners are lowered from the rafters where retired jerseys are also displayed, rekindling memories of the four titles from 1997 to 2008 and the seven championships from 1936-55. The most successful U.S.-based NHL franchise has had some of the game's all-time greats wear its sweater, adorned with a winged well, from Gordie Howe to Steve Yzerman and Nicklas Lidstrom.\n\nThe good times fade during the lights-and-sounds pregame show as the pace of the music picks up and a video montage shows the current team, mostly a mix of role-playing veterans and not-ready prospects. When the lights are turned up closer to game time, more seats appear to be empty than occupied on some nights.\n\nDetroit is among the worst teams in the league this season \u2014 as expected and by design. The Red Wings hope a painfully poor season will help get them on the fast track to retool with difference-making players in the draft along with some help from veterans in free agency.\n\n\"I knew it was coming and I was prepared for it,\" said Red Wings senior vice president Jim Devellano, who is in his 37th season with the team and his 52nd in the NHL. \"I don't like it. It upsets me, but not to the point that I'm going to go off the deep end.\"\n\nThe Red Wings appear destined to miss the playoffs for a third straight year after a remarkable run of 25 consecutive postseason appearances. Other than the current players and coaches, who are trying to win every game, losing is seen as a necessary evil. Some fans, though, appear to be so fed up they don't even sit in seats they paid for to attend games.\n\nIn an effort to make the sparsely filled sections at Little Caesars Arena stand out less in person and on TV, the backs of red seats have been temporarily covered in black. They will eventually be replaced by black chairs at a considerable cost in a 1-year-old arena that is the centerpiece of a $1.2 billion project.\n\nDetroit got off to the worst start in franchise history by opening with seven losses and winning only one of its first 10 games. The Red Wings have bounced back with four wins in their last five.\n\n\"I wouldn't say it takes the sting out of the slow start, but it's something to build off of for sure,\" forward Justin Abdelkader said during the recent surge.\n\nWinning could prove to be counterproductive for the Motor City's hockey team this season.\n\nPart of what has held the Red Wings' rebuilding effort back is the fact they haven't had a No. 1 overall pick in the draft in recent years to get a generational player. If they lose enough this season and have some luck in the NHL draft lottery to get the top pick, Jack Hughes would give the franchise and its followers a desperately needed boost. Hughes is a playmaking center for USA Hockey's 18-under team, which trains and plays in suburban Detroit. His skill would help the team on the ice, though perhaps not right away, and his presence would provide a boost in interest for a team struggling to regain its standing as one of the most popular in a sports-crazed state.\n\nThe Red Wings have also hurt their chances of continuing the success they had for two-plus decades by drafting players, particularly on the blue line, that didn't pan out. And while Detroit is close to the bottom in the NHL standings, its payroll is larger than about 20 teams in the league.\n\nThe team has invested in its 2014 first-round pick, 22-year-old center Dylan Larkin , by giving him a $30.5 million, six-year contract last summer. It is trying to surround him with players to push the franchise back toward the playoffs and eventually championship contention.\n\n\"We've got to rebuild by drafting, developing and being patient,\" general manager Ken Holland said early in his 22nd season in charge and 36th with the franchise. \"I believe we're headed in the right direction with a lot of young kids we think are ready to come of age.\"\n\nChris Ilitch, the most powerful person in the organization, seems to agree with him. The president and CEO of Ilitch Holdings, which owns the team and the arena, gave Holland a two-year contract earlier this year to continue guiding a long-term rebuilding project that is counting on 30-plus draft picks from 2017-19.\n\n\"Kenny Holland has done a marvelous job at accumulating picks, which are so important to executing a successful rebuild,\" Ilitch said. \"I think you're starting to see the fruits of the labor.\"\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK\n\nThe defending champion Washington Capitals host Pittsburgh on Wednesday night, the first meeting between the teams since the Penguins won their season opener.

The Vatican retirement age is 75.\n\nPope Francis named a temporary administrator for Guam in 2016 after Apuron was accused by former altar boys of sexually abusing them when he was a priest. Dozens of cases involving other priests on the island have since come to light, and the archdiocese is facing more than $115 million in lawsuits alleging child sexual abuse by priests.\n\nChurch lawyer Keith Talbot says the church has been able to settle two cases.\n\nSome Catholics on Guam said they were not surprised at the church\u2019s bankruptcy announcement.\n\n\u201cI knew it was going to happen,\u201d said 68-year-old Judith Salas. \u201cEventually they would have to pay.\u201d\n\nFrancis Santos, 60, a member of his parish\u2019s finance council, said the move was inevitable. \u201cThe church had to take a position to save all the churches and schools,\u201d he said. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m glad.

(AP Photo/Holly Hart) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) \u2014 AJ Bush finally will get to play a game at Nebraska's Memorial Stadium.\n\nHis opportunity has come in a way he never could have imagined when he showed up in Lincoln fresh out of high school in 2014.\n\nHe left after two years to search for playing time, and he's found it at his fourth school, Illinois, where he won the starting quarterback's job for his only season there as a graduate transfer.\n\nAs much as Bush wants to not make a big deal out of his return Saturday, he knows it would be disingenuous to say it's not.\n\n\"It's a pretty special day,\" he said.\n\nBush then fell back on how it's another game, another chance for the Illini to win.\n\nAnd then.\n\n\"I know what kind of place that is,\" he said. \"I know what kind of great environment that is.

A lot of the team now, some of them I came in with that are redshirt seniors. Others I hosted (on recruiting visits) and took under my wing when I was a sophomore and they came in as freshmen.\"\n\nBo Pelini was the coach whose staff recruited Bush to Nebraska out of Alpharetta, Georgia, and he redshirted his first year. Mike Riley took over for the fired Pelini in 2015, and Bush never rose higher than No. 3 on the depth chart.\n\nInstead of transferring to a Bowl Subdivision school and sitting out another season, Bush enrolled at Iowa Western Community College the day before classes started in 2016 and ended up playing 10 games.\n\nFrom there, it was on to Virginia Tech, where he backed up Josh Jackson last year. Hokies coach Justin Fuente asked Bush to change positions for this season, but Bush wanted to remain a quarterback. He graduated from Tech with a sociology degree in May and headed to Illinois.\n\nBush has been a good fit in offensive coordinator Rod Smith's dual-threat system. Bush ranks second among Big Ten quarterbacks in rushing, at 67 yards per game, and he's gone over 100 three times. He's completed 57 percent of his passes for 132 yards per game.\n\nThe 6-foot-4, 225-pounder heads to Nebraska off his best game, a 55-31 win over Minnesota. He ran for 127 yards and two touchdowns and completed 18 of 25 passes for 216 yards and two TDs.\n\n\"It's a special time when you get a chance to go back to a place you considered home, where you have history,\" Illini coach Lovie Smith said. \"Yeah, there's a little bit of incentive, I'm sure.\"\n\nThe game pits two struggling Big Ten West teams \u2014 Illinois is 4-5, Nebraska 2-7 \u2014 hoping to finish the season on a positive note.\n\nIt's a bit more than that for Bush, whose former teammates are looking forward to seeing him.\n\n\"AJ is a great guy,\" said offensive lineman Jerald Foster, who arrived at Nebraska with Bush. \"It was hard to see when he left, but I knew he was going to do big things. His whole trip \u2014 Iowa Western to Virginia Tech then now to Illinois \u2014 it's wild. But he's a worker. I'm happy that he's finally going to be able to come back to the stadium.

Bush showed Barry around during his recruiting visit, and the two hit it off.\n\nBarry said he and Bush used to rib each other on the practice field and that he looks forward to getting reacquainted on the game field, hopefully in the Illinois backfield.\n\n\"When I get my opportunity,\" a smiling Barry said, \"I'll make him know that I'm there.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTOKYO (AP) \u2014 Attention Simone Biles: They're building a venue in Tokyo where you can add to the four Olympic gold medals you won in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe 2020 Olympic gymnastics venue is halfway completed and should be finished by this time next year.\n\nOn Wednesday, engineers raised a massive timber roof section, one of five curved sections that will top out the 20.5 billion yen ($180 million) building, which designers describe as being shaped like a wooden bowl.\n\n\"Japan's wood culture will be communicated through the venue,\" architect Hidemichi Takahashi said through an interpreter.\n\nWood has been traditionally used in Japanese housing, and religious shrines and temples.\n\nEach of the five wooden sections weighs 200 metric tons, or 200,000 kilograms (440,000 pounds). Officials said the wood used in the roof is larch, a conifer in the pine family.\n\nThe section raised on Wednesday was lifted from the ground at a glacial pace of about 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) per minute, so trying to see the movement was like watching clock hands barely move.\n\n\"By using wood instead of steel, the weight of the roof is cut in half,\" Takahashi said.\n\nThe venue will also have timber seating \"to give fans the feel of the warmth of wood,\" Takahashi added.\n\nOfficials said all the wood in the venue is Japanese. There has been some controversy about the origin of wood used in the new Olympic Stadium, which is under construction in central Tokyo.\n\nThe gymnastics venue will seat about 12,000 and will be used for 10 years after the Olympics as a convention center by the Tokyo metropolitan government. After that, plans call for the building to be razed.\n\nThe venue is located in the Tokyo Bay region in an area known as Ariake. The area will also have Olympic venues for tennis, volleyball, BMX and skateboarding.\n\nLocated close by in the bay region are also venues for triathlon, marathon swimming, beach volleyball, swimming, water polo, archery, 3x3 basketball, sport climbing, hockey, equestrian, canoeing and rowing.\n\nOlympic organizers and the International Olympic Committee have been criticized for leaving behind empty, unused venues in Rio de Janeiro \u2014 where Biles was among the stars of the games \u2014 and earlier this year at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\n\nTokyo organizers are using a mix of new, old and temporary venues, hoping to avoid the stigma of creating white elephants.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Colliton replaces Joel Quenneville who was fired on Tuesday. (AP Photo/Kamil Krzaczynski) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Jeremy Colliton knows all about Joel Quenneville's legacy with the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nHe thinks he knows what to do, too.\n\n\"I have a huge amount of respect for Joel,\" Colliton said. \"Those are huge shoes to fill. I won't try to fill them. I've got to be myself. And we're different people, so I'll bring different things to the table, different ideas to the table.\"\n\nChicago is hoping Colliton's fresh perspective will help the team get back on track after he became the 38th head coach in franchise history on Tuesday, taking over when Quenneville was fired after a wildly successful run with the Blackhawks.\n\nColliton goes from Chicago's American Hockey League affiliate in Rockford, Illinois, to the NHL's youngest head coach at 33. Blackhawks forward Chris Kunitz, defenseman Duncan Keith and goaltenders Corey Crawford and Cam Ward are older than Colliton, and defenseman Brent Seabrook also is 33.\n\n\"I have to earn their trust by them believing that I can help them win, that I can help them be better individually, that we as a staff can put together a plan so they can have success,\" Colliton said. \"So if I can do that, there's no problem. It doesn't matter how old I am.\"\n\nColliton and Seabrook played alongside each other when they were kids. Colliton also made 57 appearances with the New York Islanders over five seasons, playing in his final NHL game in 2011.\n\n\"Growing up, we sort of followed the same career path as kids,\" Seabrook said, \"played in the Western League against each other, played in the World Juniors together. When we were playing he had the same agent. A lot of connections there.\n\n\"So it was nice to see him come back to North America last year and get the job in Rockford. Sounds like he did some good things in Europe and with Rockford last year.\"\n\nBut that's a far cry from the situation he faces now, replacing Quenneville after he coached Chicago to three Stanley Cup titles and nine playoff appearances.\n\nThe move comes in the wake of a winless three-game trip, extending Chicago's losing streak to five in a row heading into Thursday's home game against Carolina. The power play, a persistent problem, ranked 27th in the NHL heading into Tuesday. The Blackhawks (6-6-3) also are allowing an unseemly 3.73 goals per game.\n\n\"A decision like this isn't made on one game, one play, or one specific thing,\" general manager Stan Bowman said. \"It's sort of a collection of things. Certainly the road trip was concerning. But I think even heading into that, there were some elements to our game where they weren't where they needed to be.\"\n\nAssistants Kevin Dineen and Ulf Samuelsson also were let go. Barry Smith, 66, moved from Chicago's front office to the bench as an assistant coach.\n\nThe 60-year-old Quenneville was the longest-tenured head coach in the NHL. He had another year left on a three-year contract extension he signed in 2016 that pays him $6 million per year, second highest in the NHL behind Mike Babcock in Toronto.\n\nWhenever Quenneville wants to get back to work, he likely will have plenty of suitors.\n\nThe former NHL defenseman has 890 wins in 22 years as a head coach with St. Louis, Colorado and Chicago. Scotty Bowman, Stan's father and a senior adviser with the Blackhawks, is the only man with more regular-season victories.\n\nQuenneville took over Chicago four games into the 2008-09 season, replacing Denis Savard after the Hall of Famer was let go by former general manager Dale Tallon. What followed was an unprecedented run for one of the NHL's Original Six franchises.\n\nJonathan Toews, Patrick Kane, Keith and Seabrook blossomed with Quenneville behind the bench, and the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup in 2010, 2013 and 2015. They also made it to the conference finals in 2009 and 2014.\n\n\"He's going to be an icon in Chicago for the longest time, the great things he's done for this organization, winning three Stanley Cups, so that will never be forgotten,\" Kane said.\n\nThe pressure on Quenneville began to ramp up when Chicago was swept by Nashville in the first round of the 2017 playoffs after the Blackhawks finished with the best record in the Western Conference. Then they missed the playoffs entirely last season for the first time in a decade.\n\nThe change at coach turns up the heat on Bowman, who has made a couple of questionable moves that helped hasten the Blackhawks' decline. He traded Artemi Panarin to Columbus and Teuvo Teravainen to Carolina in part because of salary-cap issues, and each player has put up big numbers with his new club.\n\n\"I believe in this roster, I believe in Stan,\" team president John McDonough said. \"Stan is meticulous, he's very thorough and when you break down free agents, when you break down trades, some work, some don't. You'd like most to go your way and over time, they may. But his body of work is excellent. I want him to succeed.\"\n\n___\n\nAP freelance reporter Matt Carlson contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They stayed together.\"\n\nNoah Dickerson scored 16 of his 18 points in the second half, Jaylen Nowell added 17, and No. 25 Washington rallied from a nine-point halftime deficit to beat Western Kentucky 73-55 on Tuesday night.\n\nRanked in the preseason for the first time since 2011, the Huskies (1-0) slogged through an ugly first half of foul trouble and poor shooting, and leaned heavily on Dickerson to put away the Hilltoppers in the second half.\n\nLimited to just six minutes in the first half after picking up three fouls, Dickerson put together his own eight-point scoring spurt midway through the second half as the Huskies finally started to pull away. Dickerson made 6 of 8 shots and grabbed six rebounds.\n\nIt was the first extended action for Dickerson after sitting out Washington's first exhibition game and playing limited minutes in the second.\n\n\"I hadn't played in a while so it's fun to get back into things,\" Dickerson said. \"The team was looking for me and I was getting back to doing what I was doing last year.\"\n\nHe also got the best of a matchup with highly-touted Western Kentucky freshman Charles Bassey in his college debut. The 6-foot-11 forward also struggled with early foul problems and finished with 11 points and 12 rebounds before fouling out in the final moments.\n\nJared Savage and Taveion Hollingsworth combined for 21 first-half points for the Hilltoppers, but were silent in the second half combining for just eight points. Savage led Western Kentucky (0-1) with 15 points and Hollingsworth had 14.\n\nThe Hilltoppers shot just 29 percent in the second half and finished with 16 turnovers.\n\n\"It's not the points you give up as much as the energy you pump back into this arena,\" Western Kentucky coach Rick Stansbury said. \"We knew this place is a hornet's nest and we just let them come back into the game.\"\n\nWashington started the second half on a 13-0 run, erasing the damage of Western Kentucky's 17-0 run to close the first half. David Crisp's 3-pointer gave Washington a 37-36 lead and the Huskies led 40-36 before Bassey's dunk finally got the Hilltoppers on the board.\n\nBut it was a key six-point possession midway through the half that finally gave Washington a cushion. Nowell scored and a flagrant foul was called on Matt Horton against Dickerson as the pair headed down court. Dickerson hit the free throws for the foul and on the ensuing possession scored underneath to give the Huskies a 56-48 lead. Dickerson later added a dunk off a loose ball and Washington's lead was 58-50 with 7:42 remaining.

Of the 32 teams, nearly half (15) have featured a defensive player and one had a kicker among the most improved.\n\nAt the halfway point of this NFL season, here's a look at the most improved players for each team:\n\nAFC EAST\n\nNew England: Linebacker Kyle Van Noy. The Patriots traded for Van Noy out of necessity two years ago. He's grown into one of the most versatile players on New England's defense. Used almost exclusively at outside linebacker last season, he's now asked to play on the line at times, is an option in multiple blitz packages as well as in zone and man coverages.\n\nMiami: Offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil. Tunsil is becoming a top-shelf left tackle in his third season. He was plagued by penalties and other lapses, but has benefited from the mentoring of left guard Josh Sitton, who signed with the Dolphins this year.\n\nBuffalo: Linebacker Matt Milano. Milano is starting alongside first-round pick Tremaine Edmunds in essentially a two-linebacker defensive formation. A fifth-round pick in 2017, Milano was eased into the starting lineup and finished with five starts. This year, he's has started all nine games, credited with 55 tackles.\n\nN.Y. Jets: Linebacker Darron Lee. Lee was their first-round pick out of Ohio State in 2016 and has been slow to live up to his lofty draft status. He finished second on the team in tackles each of his first two seasons, but big-time impact plays were missing for a middle linebacker. He's off to the best start of his career as a more consistent playmaker.\n\nAFC SOUTH\n\nHouston: Defensive back Kareem Jackson. Jackson had a bad 2017 at cornerback, but has played both cornerback and safety this season and has been strong in a secondary that has dealt with numerous injuries.\n\nTennessee: Linebacker Jayon Brown. A fifth-round pick out of UCLA in 2017, the second-year linebacker is leading the Titans both in total tackles and with four sacks. The speedy Brown has started three of eight games this season and has been a key piece of a defense currently allowing the fewest points in the NFL.\n\nJacksonville: Kicker Josh Lambo. Lambo has made a team-record 23 consecutive field goals in the regular season, including a career-best 57-yarder in London. He had made 27 in a row, including the playoffs, and all 12 of his extra points in 2018.\n\nIndianapolis: Quarterback Andrew Luck. Luck didn't just miss all 16 games last season but 26 of 45 overall because of various injuries (shoulder, lacerated kidney, concussion and then shoulder again). Luck has completed 65.8 percent of his passes, is second in TD passes (23) and is on pace to top 4,000 yards again.\n\nAFC NORTH\n\nPittsburgh: Running back James Conner. Conner has seamlessly replaced Le'Veon Bell with four games with at least 100 rushing yards, 50 receiving yards and at least one touchdown, the most such games by a player in a single season in NFL history. Conner has 1,085 scrimmage yards (706 rushing, 379 receiving) and 10 total touchdowns (nine rushing, one receiving).\n\nCincinnati: Wide receiver Tyler Boyd. Boyd has been a solid complement to star A.J. Green. He has 49 catches for 620 yards and five TDs and will be counted on in the second half with Green dealing with a toe injury.\n\nBaltimore: Quarterback Joe Flacco. Despite his team's recent slump, Flacco has done well for the Ravens. He's got 12 TDs, six interceptions, 2,465 yards passing and an 84.15 QB rating. Last year, Flacco finished at 18 TDs, 13 INTs and 80.4. He had 3,141 yards.\n\nCleveland: Defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi. Ogunjobi, a third-round pick in 2017, made one start as a rookie. The 6-foot-3, 305-pounder has developed into a stout run stopper. He also has quickness to get to the quarterback. His presence inside has forced teams to adjust their blocking schemes and given Myles Garrett some favorable one-on-one matchups.\n\nAFC WEST\n\nKansas City: Quarterback Pat Mahomes. Mahomes started Week 17 last year, but in his first full season as No. 1 QB he's breaking records all over the place. Mahomes, who appeared in his 10th career game last Sunday against Cleveland, has 29 touchdown passes and 3,185 passing yards, both the most by a player in his first 10 games.\n\nL.A. Chargers: Running back Austin Ekeler. The second-year player, an undrafted free agent, is averaging 5.8 yards per carry and 12 yards a reception. Ekeler has teamed with Melvin Gordon to form one of the league's top running back duos.\n\nDenver: Wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders. He was hurt most of 2017 and caught two TD passes, both in Week 2 vs Cowboys. Last year, he had 47 catches for 555 yards in 12 games. This year, he has 56 catches for 707 yards and three TDs and even threw for a TD, hitting fellow SMU alum Courtland Sutton vs. Arizona.\n\nOakland: Running back Jalen Richard. Richard showed flashes his first two seasons as an undrafted free agent out of Southern Mississippi, but has emerged as a key part of coach Jon Gruden's offense.\n\nNFC EAST\n\nWashington: Safety D.J. Swearinger. Swearinger is tied for the NFL lead with four interceptions as a key part of a secondary that has Washington in first place.\n\nPhiladelphia: Running back Wendell Smallwood. Smallwood has a career-best 400 scrimmage yards (257 rushing, 143 receiving) along with one rushing TD and two receiving TDs after only playing eight games last year when he was inactive often.\n\nDallas: Linebacker Jaylon Smith. The former Notre Dame standout is finally showing his college form almost three years removed from a devastating left knee injury in his final game for the Irish.\n\nN.Y. Giants: Wide receiver Sterling Shepard. Shepard has 40 catches for 542 yards and two touchdowns. Despite a porous offensive line, he is on pace for career highs.\n\nNFC SOUTH\n\nNew Orleans: Defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins. Rankins was a 2016 first-rounder who missed the first half of his rookie season with a leg injury. Last season, he was solid, but highlights were few. Through the first eight games, Rankins has four sacks and 21 total tackles, on pace for considerable increases in those categories.\n\nCarolina: Defensive tackle Kyle Love. Love is a backup, but is making some outstanding plays in the middle of the line, including a forced fumble in Week 8 against Ravens RB Alex Collins that led to a TD and helped turn the game.\n\nAtlanta: Free safety Damontae Kazee. Kazee is tied for the NFL lead with four interceptions. He was forced into a starting role after Keanu Neal and Ricardo Allen were placed on IR.\n\nTampa Bay: Tight end O.J. Howard. The Bucs attribute Howard's growth to being in his second year, being more comfortable with the playbook and the offense in general. He has caught three touchdown passes in the past two games.\n\nNFC NORTH\n\nChicago: Quarterback Mitchell Trubisky. Trubisky has a 96.1 passer rating, 64.6 percent completion rate, 16 touchdown passes, seven interceptions and a 5-3 record. Last year, he had a 77.5 rating, 59.4 percent completion rate, seven TD passes, seven interceptions and a 4-8 record.\n\nMinnesota: Defensive end Stephen Weatherly. Weatherly was a seventh-round draft pick in 2016 who spent most of the season on the practice squad and mostly was on special teams in 2017. But when Everson Griffen was sidelined, Weatherly moved into the starting lineup and had seven tackles, two quarterback hits and one sack in his first career start against the Bills.\n\nGreen Bay: Defensive lineman Kenny Clark. Clark, playing in his first-year of coordinator Mike Pettine's system, already has four sacks in seven games, nearly equaling his output (4\u00bd) last year.\n\nDetroit: Wide receiver Kenny Golladay. Golladay has surpassed his rookie season production and that allowed the Lions to trade Golden Tate to the Eagles at the deadline. He has 33 receptions for 523 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nNFC WEST\n\nL.A. Rams: Linebacker Cory Littleton. After two years as a backup linebacker and special teams guy, Littleton, an undrafted free agent, earned the starting job when Alec Ogletree was traded in the offseason.\n\nSeattle: Running back Chris Carson. Carson showed flashes last year before getting hurt, but the combo of a better offensive line and a new running scheme has fully displayed his skills.\n\nArizona: Safety Budda Baker. Baker has made a big impact after having his role greatly expanded after being a first-team All-Pro on special teams as a rookie. Now he's a significant part of the regular defense, not just a special teams ace.\n\nSan Francisco: Tight end George Kittle. Kittle was a pleasant surprise as a fifth-round pick last year with 43 catches for 515 yards after being mostly used as a blocker at Iowa. He now is one of the game's most well-rounded tight ends. He ranks third at the position with 41 catches and second with 692 yards and is a powerful blocker in the run game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Facebook stopped short of definitively connecting the IRA to the activity.\n\n\"We had already blocked most of these accounts yesterday, and have now blocked the rest,\" Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, said in a statement. \"This is a timely reminder that these bad actors won't give up.\"\n\nWith Americans headed to the polls Tuesday, social media companies were on high alert for foreign interference, eager not to see a repeat of the 2016 presidential election when the IRA posed as far-right and left-wing groups on Facebook, Google's YouTube and Twitter to churn out divisive messages on hot-button topics such as race and immigration to influence how people voted.\n\nThe Instagram accounts, which were undetected by Facebook for at least a year, ran the gamut, some claiming to support feminists, others African-Americans and LGBT communities, Think Progress reported. Many targeted people interested in celebrities such as Rihanna, Kendrick Lamar and the Kardashians or far-right or left-wing commentators. Pages that talked of \"libtards\" sidled up to conservatives and supporters of Donald Trump, while pages such as \"New Blue Wave\" were aimed at Democrats. The most popular account focused on comedian John Oliver and had more than 100,000 followers.\n\nThe statement claiming to be from the IRA alleged Russian operatives not only influenced how Americans voted but rigged the outcomes in key races. The group is under indictment by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\n\"The victory of the Democratic party is our top priority in these midterm elections,\" the statement said. Democrats gained control of the House but Republicans expanded their majority in the Senate on Tuesday night.\n\nThe group offered up its picks to win their respective races. That list included some Election Night winners, but also Orrin Hatch, who's retiring from the Senate and whose Utah seat was won by former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, and Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican who is stepping down at the end of his term.\n\nSecurity experts warned before Tuesday's midterms that bad actors would attempt to take credit for election interference that did not occur.\n\n\"Americans need to strike a careful balance between being wary for election manipulation and being skeptical of unsupported claims of manipulation,\" former Facebook security chief Alex Stamos said Monday.\n\nGraham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, said statements like the one issued Tuesday night would be a low cost way for the IRA to cast doubt, sow political discord and \"give more oxygen to their operations.\"\n\n\"This is significant,\" he said. \"I am confident we will learn more in coming days.\"\n\nIn 2014, the IRA began targeting candidates and issues to heighten political rancor and divisions in the contentious presidential race, according to a February indictment which named 13 Russians with ties to the agency. At least 146 million people on Facebook and Instagram were reached by a combination of ads and posts, according to Facebook.\n\nLast month, the Justice Department said it had uncovered another Russian attempt to meddle in the midterm elections. Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova, 44, of St. Petersburg, Russia, was charged with playing a key role in Project Lakhta, which had an operating budget of $10 million from January through June, to provide \"information warfare against the United States,\" according to the indictment.\n\nAfter heavy criticism from lawmakers for failing to detect and purge election interference in 2016, Facebook has made safeguarding elections around the world one of its top priorities.\n\nIt has set up an elections \"war room\" on its campus in Menlo Park, California, where data scientists, engineers and other employees monitor foreign election manipulation, disinformation, voter suppression and other security challenges under a large American flag. It's also hired more people and strengthened automated systems to monitor what's posted on Facebook and it has introduced tighter controls on who can buy political ads.\n\nLast week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors that his company was getting better at detecting foreign election interference but that \"there are going to be things that our systems miss, no matter how well tuned we are.\"\n\nOn Monday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and FBI Director Christopher Wray released a joint statement saying foreign operatives were seeking to influence American voters and might allege they pulled off election interference that did not take place.\n\n\"Americans should be aware that foreign actors \u2013 and Russia in particular \u2013 continue to try to influence public sentiment and voter perceptions through actions intended to sow discord,\" the statement read. \"They can do this by spreading false information about political processes and candidates, lying about their own interference activities, disseminating propaganda on social media, and through other tactics.\"\n\nMore: Facebook uncovers Iran disinformation to sow political discord over Trump, race\n\nMore: Facebook discloses possible election meddling by Russia, foreign actors on eve of midterms\n\nMore: Facebook, Twitter whack away at midterm misinformation on Election Day\n\nMore: Who paid for that political ad in your Facebook feed?

USA TODAY\n\nLSU Tigers head coach Ed Orgeron yells from the sidelines during the game against the Miami Hurricanes at AT&T Stadium. (Photo: Matthew Emmons, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAnother week, another breathless unveiling \u2013 followed by more crystallizing perceptions about the College Football Playoff race, never mind that the season is only now headed into its fourth quarter.\n\nThat\u2019s the takeaway from Tuesday night\u2019s updated CFP Top 25. It\u2019s Alabama (we knew), followed by Clemson (yes), then Notre Dame (OK) and Michigan (makes sense). Georgia, Oklahoma and then \u2013 wait, what? \u2013 somehow LSU, with Washington State, West Virginia and Ohio State rounding out the top 10.\n\nSo there you have \u2018em, the latest rankings put out by the selection committee that, not quite a month from now, will get together for the only set that matters. Or at least, that\u2019s the theory.\n\nPlayoff officials like to say \u2013 well, let selection committee chairman Rob Mullens say it:\n\n\u201cAs we do every week, we start with a clean sheet of paper,\u201d he said Tuesday night, \u201creviewing every team\u2019s play from the first game to the most recent.\u201d\n\nThe idea is to rank teams as though they had not ranked them the week before. There\u2019s no reason to disbelieve him. It\u2019s certainly the goal; the committee does its best to do exactly that. But is it reality?\n\n(Does anyone believe LSU would rank No. 7, with a 29-point shutout loss at home to No. 1 Alabama and a loss to a mediocre Florida team that just got drilled by Missouri, if LSU had not been ranked No. 3 last week? Aside: Even knowing last week\u2019s ranking, can anyone figure out why the Tigers are ranked No. 7?)\n\nHuman nature makes it very hard to forget where teams were slotted the week before, no? And if not the committee members, it\u2019s certainly difficult for the rest of college football, which treats these rankings each week as though they matter.\n\nCollege Football Playoff rankings: Alabama, Clemson, Notre Dame, Michigan in top four\n\nBowl projections: Michigan moves into College Football Playoff spot as Ohio State falls\n\nPerhaps as important is the perception that\u2019s formed after each week\u2019s fresh Top 25 \u2013 and almost as important, after whatever the committee chairman said about how that ranking was derived. And all of this is despite the fact that teams routinely grow through the season \u2013 though sometimes it\u2019s not easily evident from week to week, but only in stepping back to look at the bigger picture. Weekly rankings are not conducive to those kinds of evaluations, regardless of intent.\n\nMullens, whose day job is as Oregon\u2019s athletic director, is the latest to step into the role as the committee\u2019s chairman, which is high profile and thankless at the same time. And to be clear: Especially after the in-season rankings, the reasons Mullens gives and the opinions he expresses might or might not be the actual reasons a team was ranked high or low, or the actual consensus opinion of the committee.\n\nThe problem: Like Jeff Long and Kirby Hocutt before him, what Mullens says each week becomes part of the crystallizing perception of the playoff race.\n\nTeam A is a complete team? We\u2019re concerned about Team B\u2019s defense? It\u2019s one thing when the talking heads do it \u2013 everybody\u2019s got an opinion \u2013 but another when the committee chairman does.\n\nMullens\u2019 words carry weight, and often set the narrative for the next week in the college football universe \u2013 on TV and radio talk-fests, in opinion columns, on game broadcasts and so much more \u2013 and then a week later, we get another incremental update.\n\nIn that atmosphere, perceptions about teams take shape and harden, even while there are multiple games left to play \u2013 this week, 25 percent of the season still remains.\n\nRob Mullens, chair of the #CFBPlayoff selection committee, caught up with @ESPN_ReceDavis following the announcement of this week's College Football Playoff rankings! \ud83d\udde3@ESPN@ESPNCFB\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfc8\ud83c\udfc6 pic.twitter.com/rmtaYMHXpQ \u2014 College Football Playoff (@CFBPlayoff) November 7, 2018\n\nIt\u2019s not a feature of the playoff system; it\u2019s a bug. So here\u2019s a modest set of proposals that would be better:\n\n1. Don\u2019t do weekly rankings. Leave it to everyone else. Trust us, the conversation won\u2019t falter. And we won\u2019t have official weight attached to stubborn perceptions of ever-evolving teams.\n\nJust wait until the end of the season, when a team\u2019s body of work is actually full, when conference championships have been won, when we\u2019ve seen it all, and pick the teams then.\n\nOne valid concern about doing it that way was that the committee might emerge with a jarring result, a playoff bracket that did not resemble what everyone expected. Thus, the idea went, it wasn\u2019t a bad thing to provide at least a glimpse of the committee\u2019s thinking earlier in the season.\n\nBut a public conditioned to polls has instead been startled when teams rise or drop in the final rankings. And there\u2019s no way to calculate how the weekly rankings have hardened opinions, both internally on the committee and externally \u2013 which forms the atmosphere college football fans (and committee members) swim in all week \u2013 to the detriment of teams that grow through the season.\n\n2. Rather than weekly, do a mid-season ranking \u2013 a peek at where teams stand in the committee\u2019s collective eyes \u2013 and then the final rankings. Or do a midseason ranking, then another three weeks later, and then the final set. It would allow for more than incremental progress, which often doesn\u2019t capture teams\u2019 gradual evolution (or devolution).\n\nThose proposals aren\u2019t new, of course; they\u2019ve been discussed at various times by the playoff\u2019s management committee, and change is not coming. The weekly reveal is a made-for-TV event, part of the package ESPN paid so much for (and this is not a shot at ESPN; FOX would\u2019ve jumped at the idea, too). But it\u2019s become part of the process. It\u2019s not going away.\n\nBut one last thought: If you\u2019re dead set on weekly committee updates, for goodness\u2019 sake don\u2019t make Mullens talk about it. Like his predecessors, he does a nice job of trying hard not to say much of anything. But what he does say inevitably takes on far too much weight.\n\nAnd when the playoff inevitably expands to six teams or eight, it would be nice if the commissioners also revisited the idea of these supposedly meaningless rankings. They\u2019re at best unnecessary and at worst problematic, setting perception \u2013 if not in stone, at least in a hardening sludge \u2013 despite games left to be played.", "San Jose Sharks' Marcus Sorensen, left, is congratulated by Joakim Ryan (47) after scoring a goal against the Minnesota Wild during the first period of an NHL hockey game Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in San Jose, Calif. (AP Photo/Ben Margot) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) \u2014 With the San Jose Sharks needing a bit more punch from their bottom lines, they turned to Jumbo Joe.\n\nJoe Thornton's move to the third line paid instant dividends.\n\nNew linemate Marcus Sorenson had a goal and two assists as the Sharks beat the Minnesota Wild 4-3 on Tuesday night.\n\nThe 39-year-old Thornton, a four-time All-Star, joined Sorensen, who is 26 and was playing in just his eighth career game, and 25-year-old Barclay Goodrow on the third line.\n\nThe trio combined for three goals and three assists while playing their first full game together.\n\n\"It's an honor to play with him,\" said Sorenson, who had his first career three-point game. \"It was fun playing with him. He was good. He was great. He made some great plays and he scored a goal.\"\n\nGoodrow's second goal of the season broke a 3-all deadlock at 7:25 of the third period. Goodrow also had an assist and Martin Jones made 23 saves for the Sharks, who had dropped six straight to Minnesota.\n\nThornton scored his 399th career goal. He was playing in his 1,499th game, tying Mike Modano for 19th place on the NHL list.\n\n\"Obviously, Jumbo's Jumbo,\" Goodrow said. \"He's a world-class player. He's going to find you on the ice wherever you are. Marcus used his speed to get on the forecheck. We didn't turn over a lot of pucks in the offensive zone, which led to offensive zone time and scoring chances. I think we played pretty well.\"\n\nAntti Suomela scored the other San Jose goal.\n\nSharks coach Peter DeBoer attributed the win to his team's depth.\n\n\"I thought all the guys got going tonight. Antti got us a goal, Goody got us a goal, Sorensen got us a goal. Those are all the guys I'm referring to. . I thought all those guys were real good. I thought Joe Thornton was real good tonight. The whole depth of our lineup I thought was very good.\"\n\nJared Spurgeon and Matt Dumba scored 2:05 apart for the Wild to tie it at 3 early in the third period. Zach Parise also had a goal for Minnesota, and Devan Dubnyk turned back 18 shots.\n\nMinnesota (8-4-2) had won seven of eight overall and was 12-6-2 over its previous 20 games against the Sharks.\n\nNOTES: Wild C Eric Staal (illness) sat out after playing in 335 straight games. ... C Matt Hendricks was back in the lineup even though he wasn't expected to return from a lower-body injury until Thursday. ... Wild forward Mikael Granlund had his point streak snapped at 10 games. ... Sharks C Logan Couture had his point streak stopped at nine games. ...

He eventually fouled out in the second half.\n\nThe Zags led 37-29 before going on a 10-2 run over the course of 1:28. The Bulldog run gave them 47-31 advantage.

That 74-54 loss to UMBC last March, they insisted leading into the opener, was the furthest thing from their mind.\n\nTobias Howard made three 3-pointers and led Towson with 10 points, and Brian Fobbs had nine. The Tigers had long spells without a field goal in each half and finished shooting 31.7 percent (13-41). They also missed 15 of 27 free throws (46.7 percent) and turned the ball over 14 times while forcing just five by the Cavaliers.\n\nJerome was hot from the start for Virginia.

(AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Willie Desjardins was uncertain how much impact he really had on the Los Angeles Kings in his first game behind their bench. The interim coach didn't alter the lineup from their last game under John Stevens, and he hasn't yet implemented any major strategic changes.\n\nWhatever or whoever was behind it, the Kings showed more than enough spark to rout their closest rivals.\n\nIlya Kovalchuk had a goal and two assists, and the Kings opened Desjardins' tenure with a 4-1 win over the Anaheim Ducks on Tuesday night.\n\nJack Campbell made 30 saves and picked up his first career assist as the Kings comfortably won the first Freeway Faceoff of the season for these two struggling Southern California rivals.\n\nDustin Brown and Kyle Clifford scored first-period goals for the Kings as they picked right back up from Saturday's win over Columbus to earn their first back-to-back victories of the season.\n\nDesjardins has run just one practice since getting his new job Sunday after the Kings fired Stevens early in his second season in charge. Los Angeles had slumped to the bottom of the overall NHL standings, but the Kings welcomed the new boss with a big win.\n\n\"It was good to get back,\" Desjardins said. \"I thought the guys played hard. I thought we didn't maintain the game as well as we wanted, but the first period was a good start, and we'll build on that.\"\n\nThe former Vancouver coach's new players responded with plenty of the passion they often lacked under Stevens, who took the fall along with assistant coach Don Nachbaur for the Kings' 4-8-1 start. Tyler Toffoli's empty-net goal clinched LA's third win in four games following a six-game skid.\n\n\"It was a wakeup call for everybody,\" said Kovalchuk, who has nine points in the last four games. \"We're taking responsibility for what happened, and we're responding to it. We looked in the mirror, and we all know we can do a better job.\"\n\nRyan Kesler scored and John Gibson stopped 23 shots for the injury-wracked Ducks, who have lost eight of nine and earned points in just three games during that span. While the Kings appear to be turning a corner, Anaheim is stuck.\n\n\"They pushed us, and we had no response,\" Kesler said. \"Very disappointed in that. We got down 3-0, we had a pretty good second period, and in the third period, we really didn't muster very much.\"\n\nBrown got the Kings' first goal of Desjardins' tenure when he swatted Kovalchuk's centering pass out of midair just 6\u00bd minutes in. The goal was Brown's third in four games since spending the first 10 games of the season sidelined by a broken finger.\n\nClifford scored his second goal of the season later in the opening period, getting alone in front of Gibson for a backhand. Kovalchuk made it 3-0 early in the second, getting his fifth goal on a breakaway set up by a long pass from Campbell.\n\nKesler got the Ducks going with a deflection of Marcus Pettersson's shot later in the second, but Anaheim didn't score again.\n\n\"I didn't think we had the intensity that was required early in the hockey game,\" Anaheim coach Randy Carlyle said. \"It took us kind of halfway through the game before we got ourselves awake. Even though we didn't play to the level we're capable of, I think it's a good start for our group.\"\n\nNOTES: Campbell was Desjardins' goalie with the AHL's Texas Stars from 2012-14. ... The clubs met for the 138th time. The Kings improved to 61-51-26 in the Freeway Faceoff. ... Ducks captain Ryan Getzlaf returned to the lineup after missing one game with an upper-body injury, but Anaheim is still without forwards Corey Perry, Ondrej Kase and Nick Ritchie. ... Ducks forward Brian Gibbons got hurt in a collision with teammate Andrew Cogliano at the moment Kesler's goal entered LA's net. Gibbons bled onto the ice from his face before heading to the dressing room. He returned for the third period.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDucks: Host the Calgary Flames on Wednesday night.\n\nKings: Host the Minnesota Wild on Thursday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: www.apnews.com/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/AJ Mast) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Zion Williamson and fourth-ranked Duke were well on their way to a blowout victory when the high-flying freshman blocked a shot to start yet another Blue Devil fastbreak.\n\nWilliamson dribbled up the left side, whipped a pass through traffic to classmate RJ Barrett, then met him under the basket with a hearty chest bump after Barrett fought off a foul to finish his layup.\n\nDuke's fabulous freshman weren't just ready for their first turn in the spotlight.\n\n\"They were magnificent,\" coach Mike Krzyzewski said.\n\nBarrett scored 33 points and Williamson added 28 as both players broke the school record by points in a freshman debut, and the Blue Devils romped over No. 2 Kentucky 118-84 on Tuesday night in the season-opening Champions Classic.\n\n\"To play this well on this stage, right away against Kentucky is surprising,\" Krzyzewski said after picking up victory No. 1,101 for his career. \"I'm really proud of my freshmen.\"\n\nThey were almost flawless.\n\nBarrett was 13 of 26 from the field with six assists and four rebounds, and Williamson went 11 of 13 from the field with seven rebounds.\n\nDuke won for the eighth time in the last 10 meetings between two of the nation's four winningest programs, and this time handed coach John Calipari his first opening-night loss at Kentucky and his most lopsided loss since taking the job a decade ago.\n\nThe teams set a Classic record for most combined points, set hours earlier in No. 1 Kansas' 92-87 victory over No. 10 Michigan State.\n\nDuke's newcomers never doubted they could win this convincingly.\n\n\"We weren't surprised we were winning by so much,\" Barrett said. \"We know what we have.

We've still got a good group.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nKentucky: It was an embarrassing performance for the Wildcats, who weren't physical enough against Williamson and couldn't keep up with Barrett.

He finished with 14 points, nine rebounds and five assists. ... Kentucky shot 44 percent from the field but allowed the Blue Devils to shoot 54 percent. ...

It will place a check and balance on President Trump's power and could tie up his agenda for the next couple of years. USA TODAY\n\nVoters line up at the Pittman Park Recreation center in south Atlanta where some early voters waited more than 3 hours to vote. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 After a tumultuous Election Night, Democrats on Wednesday morning had the big prize they desperately wanted: control of the House of Representatives. But Republicans could claim bragging rights as well by bolstering their hold on the Senate.\n\nBefore the 2020 presidential campaign begins in earnest, what have we learned?\n\nWell, for starters, it's too late for that, because the next campaign is well underway. That's Lesson #1.\n\n1. It's 2020 already\n\nPresident Donald Trump filed for re-election the day he was inaugurated, and his campaign already has raised $100 million and begun airing TV and digital ads. So it should be no surprise that Trump campaigned more aggressively than any other modern president during the election midway through his term. He drew thousands of supporters to huge rallies, where he talked more about himself than the candidates he was there to boost. Some were in states crucial for his re-election prospects. On Monday, he closed the campaign with events in Ohio, Indiana and Missouri, and he officially announced his 2020 slogan: \"Keep America Great.\"\n\nFor Democratic presidential hopefuls, the campaign was an opportunity to audition. A stream of potential contenders managed to make their way to Iowa, the state that is set to hold the opening presidential caucuses in 15 months or so: Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Plus governors Steve Bullock of Montana, John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Jay Inslee of Washington state. And Representatives Eric Swalwell of California and John Delaney of Maryland. Even Stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenatti.\n\nSome Democrats saw the midterms as a testing ground for a more assertively liberal message by the party's 2020 standard-bearer, whoever it turns out to be. \"You showed the country that progressives can win and win decisively in the heartland,\" Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, sometimes mentioned as a presidential possibility, told cheering supporters at his re-election victory party Tuesday night. \"And you showed the country by putting people first and by honoring the dignity of work, we carry a state that Donald Trump won by almost double digits.\"\n\n2. There's a new political divide.\n\nA college diploma is the new political divide.\n\nThe gender gap \u2013 the tendency for women to vote more Democratic than men do \u2013 is familiar, a regular feature of American elections since 1980. Now a sharp divide over education has added another dimension and opened a new breach between white voters who have a college degree and those who don't. (African-American voters at all education levels typically vote Democratic, as do many Hispanics.)\n\nA USA TODAY analysis of counties across the country who have the largest proportion of residents with college degrees showed a significant shift since the last midterm, in 2014. Then, they voted for the Republican congressional candidate by 15 percentage points. This time, they backed the Democrat by a single point.\n\nThe education gap is particularly yawning between college-educated white women and non-college educated white men.\n\nGoing into Tuesday's election, college-educated white women preferred Democratic congressional candidates by 18 percentage points, a Marist/NPR Poll found, while white men without a college degree backed Republicans by 33 points \u2013 a jaw-dropping 51-point gap.\n\nThat helps explain both parties' campaign strategies. Republicans focused on ousting Democratic senators from interior states like Indiana and North Dakota, where the population is whiter, older and less likely to have a college degree than states on the coasts. Democrats aimed their efforts at defeating House Republicans from suburban districts across the country where more residents have graduated from college.\n\nThis could signal the start of a realignment between the two major parties, with repercussions for presidential elections down the road. Consider this: 41 percent of white men without a college education strongly approved of Trump, one of his best showings. Among college-educated white women, 56 percent strongly disapproved, one of his worst.\n\n3. Obamacare is recovering\n\nIn the past two midterms, no issue hurt Democratic congressional candidates more than the Affordable Care Act. Backlash to the law contributed to the historic loss of 63 House seats in 2010 \u2013 and with that Democratic control \u2013 and an additional 13 in 2014. Since Obamacare was enacted in 2009, Republicans campaigned on a promise to repeal it in four successive elections. Despite holding dozens of votes, they failed to do that even after winning the White House and control of Congress.\n\nThis time, in a turnaround, most of the ads that mentioned the Affordable Care Act this time were being aired by Democrats who accused Republicans of undermining its protection for patients with pre-existing health conditions. The Wesleyan Media Project calculated that close to 60 percent of the TV ads supporting Democratic congressional candidates last month mentioned health care; fewer than 10 percent of Democratic ads did in 2010 and 2014.\n\nRepublicans were on the defensive about their vote last year to weaken Obamacare's protections by allowing states to waive some of the law's requirements. What's more, Republican attorneys general in 20 states have joined in a lawsuit that challenges the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act and would overturn the framework that protects coverage for those with chronic illnesses.\n\nBy the end of this campaign, Trump and other Republicans were promising not to repeal Obamacare but to preserve those protections, although they offer few specifics about how they would do that. In exit polls by a media consortium including ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC, four in 10 called health care the most important issue, far more than the number who cited immigration or the economy or gun policy.\n\n4. Mega-money talks\n\nBig money. Small money. More money.\n\nTotal spending on the elections topped $5.2 billion, the Center for Responsive Politics estimated \u2013 the biggest jump in midterm fundraising in at least two decades. Republican candidates raised record amounts of money, and Democratic candidates raised even more.\n\n\"There's more money in campaigns than you could have ever imagined,\" says Stuart Rothenberg, a veteran analyst with the non-partisan Inside Elections. \"Who would think of spending $10 million in a House campaign?\" This year, more than $46 million was spent in the most expensive House contest, in Georgia's 6th congressional district, and seven other House races saw total spending of more than $15 million.\n\nThe amounts surged both because of a handful of big donors \u2013 13 contributors gave more than $10 million each \u2013 and millions of small ones. The huge Democratic war chest made it possible for the party to finance some longer-shot campaigns.\n\nRothenberg predicts there will be no turning back. \"I don't think this is going to be a unique circumstance,\" he said. \"It's a new reality.\"\n\n5. Women roar\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, Trump defined the emerging Republican Party. Women \u2013 as candidates, contributors, voters and activists \u2013 defined the emerging Democratic Party.\n\nThat began the day after the president was inaugurated with massive women's marches promising resistance. What followed was two years of unprecedented activism. Take House races, tracked by Rutgers' Center for American Women and Politics: 476 women filed as candidates; the previous record was 298. On Election Day, 237 were on the ballot; the previous record was 167.\n\nRecords were broken by female contenders for every sort of office, for governorships, Senate seats and state legislative races. A record number of women donated to campaigns, the Center for Responsive Politics reported, and often to female candidates. Women contributed $159 million to female Democratic candidates, 2\u00bd times the amount they gave two years ago.\n\n\"Women voters have outnumbered and outvoted men for nearly three decades, so that is not a new trend to this year, but what is notable this year is women's translation of advocacy and activism into both candidacy and political giving,\" said Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at Rutgers and director of a project called Gender Watch 2018. \"This year women are claiming their seats at the table.\"\n\n6. Trump rules\n\nA former Democrat who had never run for political office before his unlikely campaign two years ago is now the face of the Republican Party, redefining its tenets and reshaping its coalition.\n\nThe midterm elections underscored how completely Trump commands the GOP. Outsider Trump-like contenders upset establishment favorites for the gubernatorial nominations in Florida and Kansas. The senators most likely to criticize him, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, decided not to run again. The Republicans on the ballot who openly distanced themselves from the president could be counted on one hand, and not using all five fingers. One of the few GOP House incumbents who did, Carlos Curbelo of Florida, lost his bid for re-election.\n\nThe White House was quick to take credit for GOP gains in the Senate. \"Frankly, the candidates who have embraced the president and the president has gone in to campaign for over the last several weeks are candidates that we see doing very well tonight,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in an interview on Fox News. \"The president unified the party and brought it together.\"\n\nTrump's primacy is unchallenged even though he publicly castigated such Republican allies as House Speaker Paul Ryan and privately alarmed top party officials with divisive rhetoric. Many urged him to focus on the strength of the economy; instead, the president's closing message trumpeted dire and unsubstantiated warnings about the threat from illegal immigration.\n\n\"What's surprising to me is how sustained and intensified the support is for Donald Trump,\" Lawrence Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said when asked what he had learned during the midterms. \"The much-predicted fall of Donald Trump as a candidate and as a political figure has not been the case among Republicans. If anything, he's picked up a more intense following.\"\n\nTwo-thirds of voters in the exit polls said the president affected their vote, about one in four to show their support for him, about four in 10 to show their opposition.\n\nTrump \u2013 love him or loath him \u2013 defined the 2018 election. As he did in 2016. And as he surely will in 2020.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/07/election-day-2018-lessons-learned-message-money-women-trump-2020/1889595002/", "bad url", "bad url", "Anthony Gonzalez played five seasons for the Colts.

We came to win, play hard. Just played the whole 40 minutes,\" Patterson said.\n\nBaylor had never lost to a SWAC school. The Bears had won the previous 56 such games, 11 of those against Texas Southern.\n\nJones was LSU's coach before spending last season as associate head coach at Nevada. He took the Texas Southern job after the departure of Mike Davis, who went to Detroit Mercy after leading the Tigers to four NCAA Tournaments the past five years.\n\n\"This is a great win for our program against a quality team like Baylor,\" Jones said. \"It's about growth and we're hopeful that we'll grow from tonight.\"\n\nPatterson's 3 from the left wing was part of a game-ending 34-14 run for the Tigers. He also had two free throws with four seconds left.\n\n\"He was obviously the difference in the game. Fifth-year guy from LSU who has been in these situations before,\" Baylor coach Scott Drew said. \"He was the one guy we couldn't lose, he was the one guy you couldn't give up the shots to.\"\n\nKing McClure, the lone returning senior and the only of three returning Baylor lettermen, also had 23 points. His layup with 37 seconds left had put Baylor up 69-67 before Patterson's big 3.\n\nMcClure then missed a layup with five seconds left, then followed Patterson's free throws with a potential tying 3-point try that came up well short as time ran out after it appeared to be deflected.\n\n\"Not the start we wanted to the season,\" Drew said. \"Came in knowing we had the fourth-fewest returning lettermen and played like it tonight. We got in foul trouble. ... We played like first-game jitters.\"\n\nStill, Baylor led 55-38 after Freddie Gillespie made a jumper with 14 minutes left. Jeremy Combs then made a free throw before Devocio Butler scored seven in a row for Texas Southern \u2014 on a jumper, a layup and a 3-pointer \u2014 to get the decisive run started.\n\nTrayvon Reed had 15 points and 12 rebounds for Texas Southern.

Sohn said he believes the case can be made for damages exceeding $200 million, when projecting career contract values for the NFL's premier defensive tackles.\n\nFloyd carried that potential, but he played in only 44 games, the last on Sept. 11, 2016.\n\n\"He's trying to figure out what's next for him in life,\" Sohn said. \"That's not an easy thing, because he had no interest in ceasing to play football.\"\n\nFloyd was drafted by the Vikings out of Florida with the 23rd overall pick in 2013, and he became a full-time starter in his second season. Floyd missed three games in 2015 for cartilage cleanup in his left knee, which continued to bother him the following training camp after the Vikings exercised the fifth-year option on his contract. After playing in the 2016 season opener, Floyd needed a similar arthroscopic operation on the right knee.\n\nDuring that surgery, Sohn said, doctors determined a more comprehensive procedure was necessary to help stimulate regrowth of Floyd's cartilage. After drilling into the knee bone, a post-operation pain blocker was injected into the nerve.\n\nFloyd's leg never fully recovered enough to be able to return to the field. He was placed on the non-football injury list before the 2017 season, after which his rookie contract expired.\n\n\"Sharrif is never going to play football again because of permanent nerve and muscle damage in and around his right knee and right lower leg.

(AP) \u2014 In search of his jump shot, CJ McCollum watched every single 3-pointer he took last season looking for what he lost.\n\nFortunately for the Portland Trail Blazers, he found it.\n\nMcCollum scored 40 points and Portland beat Milwaukee 118-103 on Tuesday night to hand the Bucks their second loss in 10 games this season.\n\n\"Whether I play well or not, I know how much time I spend preparing,\" McCollum said. \"The only thing I saw was I had a lot of in-and-outs and I was shooting with a dead wrist. That was the only thing I noticed. I wasn't locking my wrist out, so I just tried to lock my wrist out.\"\n\nThe result was a dazzling performance against one of the NBA's best teams early this season.\n\n\"A lot of credit to CJ. He had a heck of a night,\" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. \"Any time we made a bit of a run or felt like the momentum might be changing, McCollum hit a big shot.\"\n\nMcCollum, who entered shooting well below his career averages, went 17 for 26 from the field and added six assists.\n\n\"It was tough,\" Milwaukee big man Brook Lopez said. \"He made some huge plays and some tough shots that definitely were contested.\"\n\nEvan Turner had 16 points and 11 rebounds off the bench for the Blazers (8-3).\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 23 points and nine rebounds.

After being a bottom-five team in 3-point attempts last season, the Bucks came in second in the NBA in 3-point tries with 41 per game. That included their 117-113 loss at Boston in which they put up 55 shots from beyond the arc. \"Yeah, it's a lot,\" Budenholzer said. \"The game is always evolving with teams, coaches and players trying to figure out what gives them the best chance. The skill of players now today is special, so trying to push that envelope.\"\n\nTrail Blazers: One of the biggest changes for the Trail Blazers this season has been utilizing Turner as the primary ball-handler on their second unit. The results have led to one of the best bench units in the NBA so far, ranking ninth in scoring. \"The second unit comes in, their ball movement, their execution \u2014 they're playing with each other,\" Budenholzer said. \"They take advantage if the defense overcommits or over-rotates. They're playing really well together. Evan Turner is kind of a great setup guy with that group.

Naz Reid was LSU's leading scorer with 17 points. Emmitt Williams had a double-double with 12 points and 10 rebounds. Darius Days had 11 points and Ja'vonte Smart added 10 points.\n\nThe other two double-figure scorers for LSU were Marlon Taylor with 15 points and Skylar Mays with 11 points.\n\n\"In the first half, we played very, very well,\" LSU coach Will Wade said. \"I wish we would have shared the ball a little bit better on offense and I wish we would have dove on a couple of loose balls.

Moses Greenwood had 12 points for Southeastern Louisiana before fouling out.\n\nLSU took control of the game in the opening four-plus minutes. Southeastern Louisiana did not score until Greenwood made a field goal with 15:35 remaining in the first half. By that time, the Tigers had opened up a 10-0 lead.\n\n\"I thought Southeastern had a tough time seeing the basket against us early in the game,\" Wade said. \"We did a good job defensively. We made sure their guys didn't get off and get going. I was proud of our effort on the glass. We had some defensive lapses in the second half that we need to clean up.\"\n\nThe back-breaking run for the Lions came during the middle of the first half.

Waters, who averaged 16 points per game as a freshman, scored just nine points against the Lions. Waters, who contributed six assists per game last season, only had two against SLU. Waters, who made five steals, did score seven of the Tigers' first 13 points.\n\nSHUT DOWN\n\nSoutheastern Louisiana point guard Marlain Veal, a preseason All-Southland Conference team selection, had a rough night in the opener. Veal, who played despite a knee injury, finished with only one point in 26 minutes.

It will place a check and balance on President Trump's power and could tie up his agenda for the next couple of years. USA TODAY\n\nDemocrats capture the House, putting restraints on a vitriol-spewing president: Our view\n\nIn Dubuque, Iowa, on Nov. 6, 2018. (Photo: Jessica Reilly/Telegraph Herald via AP)\n\nThe 2018 election was more a modest rebuke of President Donald Trump than a massive repudiation.\n\nTrump's Republicans held on to the Senate and overperformed expectations in several Senate and governor races, giving the GOP something to crow about. Indeed, Trump tweeted about \"tremendous success tonight.\"\n\nBut Democrats took control of the House of Representatives, which will bring big \u2014 and much needed \u2014 change in Washington. By putting Democrats in charge of one chamber of Congress, voters expressed their desire to place some restraints on a vitriol-spewing president that, according to surveys of voters leaving the polls, 55 percent of them disapprove of.\n\nThe party in the White House typically loses seats in midterm elections. What makes Tuesday's House outcome even more significant, however, is that it occurred in a strong economy and on a map that has been rigged to the Republicans\u2019 advantage through gross gerrymandering of congressional districts in multiple states. Going forward, weak Republican performance in suburban House districts that used to be reliably theirs should be a wake-up call for the party.\n\nIf disgust with Trump's behavior was not enough to turn many voters off, his attacks on health insurance certainly were. An Election Day survey by The Associated Press showed health care to be the most important issue on the mind of voters.\n\nThe switch in control of the House means that efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, are dead, as are a new round of tax cuts.\n\nThe new House majority also means that the many conflicts of interest in the Trump administration will get the congressional investigations that they deserve, and that the cause of law enforcement will get an ally on at least one side of Capitol Hill.\n\nWith election results still trickling in, the message is emerging that many voters are not happy with the way things have been going in the past two years. But the nation, and the Congress, remain as bitterly divided as ever, if not more so.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

(Photo: Scott Olson, Getty Images)\n\nTOPEKA, Kansas \u2014 Democrat Laura Kelly won the Kansas governor's race Tuesday, prevailing over Republican Kris Kobach after promising to slam the door on conservative budget and tax-cutting policies that were followed by persistent budget problems.\n\nKelly, a veteran state senator from Topeka, defeated Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, even though Kobach is President Donald Trump's closest ally in a state that Trump won handily in 2016. Independent candidate and Kansas City-area businessman Greg Orman trailed far behind.\n\nThe Democratic governor-elect made former Republican Gov. Sam Brownback and his ill-fated 2012-13 experiment in slashing state income taxes \u2014 not Trump \u2014 a key issue in her red state. Budget woes made Kansas a cautionary example of how not to do trickle-down economics, and Kelly was visible in the successful and bipartisan effort in 2017 that reversed most of the cuts.\n\nKelly's message resonated with even Republican voters such as Kimberli Evans, a 43-year-old federal employee from Topeka, who voted for the Democratic nominee. She said fair funding for public schools is one of her big concerns.\n\n\"I believe that the Brownback experiment did not work and needs to be reversed,\" Evans said after casting her ballot.\n\nKobach had criticized the $600 million-a-year income tax increase and campaigned on shrinking government so that the state could resume cutting taxes.\n\nKobach brought some celebrity to the race, having built a national profile as an advocate of tough immigration policies and strict voter identification laws. He has advised Trump and served as vice chairman of Trump's since-disbanded commission on voter fraud.\n\nHe narrowly ousted Gov. Jeff Colyer in the GOP primary in August after Trump defied a split among his advisers and tweeted an endorsement of Kobach. Trump carried the state easily in the 2016 presidential race and had a rally to help Kobach's campaign in October. Donald Trump Jr. had two fundraising events for him.\n\nThe contrast between Kobach and Kelly was stark because Kelly not only portrayed Kansas as in financial recovery but also had a list of places where she'd like to bolster spending, including higher education, early childhood education and mental health services.\n\nKansas is considered a deep red state with party registration 44 percent Republican and 25 percent Democratic. But its dominant Republican Party sometimes splits between moderates and conservatives, leaving an opening for a Democrat to peel off disaffected GOP voters. In recent decades the state has alternated between Republican and Democratic governors.\n\nThat GOP rift emerged this year with the nomination of Kobach, who concentrated on motivating his conservative base rather than wooing moderate voters. Kobach said that if elected he would encourage immigrants living in the state illegally to leave Kansas.\n\nKelly said Kobach's immigration policies would hurt the state's economy, particularly in western Kansas, which depends on immigrant workers for the meatpacking industry.\n\nEllie Smith, a 24-year-old Democrat, stay-at-home mom and musician from Topeka, said Kobach's positions on immigration \"hurts my heart.\"\n\n\"I believe that everybody belongs here,\" she said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/07/election-results-laura-kelly-beats-kris-kobach-kansas-governor-race/1915387002/", "NORMAL, Ill.

Xavier (1-0) then pulled away with its depleted lineup.\n\n\"It's a law of averages for Ryan,\" Steele said. \"He's a tremendous shooter. I told him at halftime to just keep shooting the ball. We've seen them go in over and over and over in practice.\"\n\nThe graduate student from San Jose State missed four of his five shots in the opening half. He made one early after the break and was 5 of 7 from beyond the arc the rest of the way with a little help from his coach.\n\n\"My teammates got me great looks,\" Welage said. \"Once I hit one or two, they started looking for me, and coach drew up a play or two that got me good looks.\"\n\nSlimmed-down forward Tyrique Jones added 17 points and six rebounds for Xavier (1-0).\n\nThe Musketeers got their first No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament last season, got upset in the second round, and lost five of their top seven scorers , including Trevon Bluiett.

Goodin is Xavier's top returning scorer and had started 52 consecutive games, including all 35 last season.\n\nJones lost more than 20 pounds in the offseason to get quicker. The 6-foot-9 forward had two steals and dunks and scored 10 points as Xavier pulled out to a 35-17 lead.\n\nCamron Justice scored nine of the Jaguars' first 17 points but was ejected for tripping Zach Hankins as he ran up the court with 6:29 left in the first half.\n\nThe Jaguars pulled ahead 42-40 on Jaylen Minnett's 3-pointer early in the second half. Minnett finished with 21 points.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nIUPUI: The Jaguars were picked to finish sixth in the Horizon League with only three starters returning: Evan Hall, D.J. McCall and Nick Rogers. IUPUI has three transfer students including Justice, who spent two years at Vanderbilt.\n\nXavier: With so many new players in the lineup and Goodin on the bench, the Musketeers were out of sync on offense until Welage started hitting from beyond the arc.\n\nOPENING TRADITION\n\nThe Musketeers have won 29 consecutive season openers, including all 18 at the Cintas Center. Overall, they've won 40 straight against nonconference opponents. They're 246-36 all-time at the arena.\n\nSLOOOOW START\n\nIUPUI went 4 of 21 from the field with eight turnovers while falling behind by 18 points at the outset.

He finished with 13 points, a team-high 36 minutes and a career-high seven assists.\n\nIN THE ZONE\n\nWith the lineup depleted and fouls adding up, Xavier went to a 2-3 zone late in the first half, when IUPUI was digging out of the 18-point deficit.\n\n\"We haven't practiced it a ton,\" Steele said. \"I thought it was effective though.\"\n\nOUT OF HERE\n\nIUPUI's Brandon Kenyon fouled out with 7:40 to go after scoring 7 points.

(Photo: Erik S. Lesser, EPA-EFE)\n\nBlame the polls for the wave that wasn't\n\nLooking at poll numbers, some hopeful Democrats anticipated a big blue wave that would wash over elections at all levels. The results were something of a disappointment to them \u2014 and a reminder to us all that poll numbers often come with a big gray cloud.\n\nAs more and more of us screen our calls, pollsters are finding it harder and harder to find people willing to answer their questions. Because the people who refuse to pick up may have different attitudes from those who respond, pollsters can\u2019t be sure that they\u2019re getting good samples. When it comes to elections, they face the additional difficulty of trying to figure out who is actually going to vote, a tough job when turnout numbers fluctuate.\n\nThe framers wanted a divided Congress\n\nThe House and Senate went in different directions, meaning that it will be hard for the two chambers to agree on legislation. Up in the Virginia neighborhood of Founders' Heaven, James Madison is probably cracking a wry smile.\n\nHe explained of the Constitution that he helped write that he wanted to create friction between the House and Senate as a way of curbing legislative overreach. As he wrote in Federalist 51, the idea was to make the two chambers \u201cas little connected with each other as the nature of their common functions and their common dependence on the society will admit.\u201d\n\n2020 could be big for Senate Democrats\n\nSenate elections have their own rhythm. Senators serve six-year terms, with about one-third of the seats coming before the voters every two years. If a party does exceptionally well in an election, then it will have to defend a disproportionate share of seats six years later. The Senate Democrats\u2019 success in 2012 was their big problem in 2018. Because they already held nearly three-quarters of the seats on the ballot this year, they had a lot to lose while enjoying relatively few chances to gain ground.\n\nNext time, the advantage will shift. Senate Republicans had a spectacular 2014 election, winning control of the chamber after eight long years in the minority. This GOP victory four years ago will mean a big Democratic opportunity two years from now. In 2020, Republicans will likely have 22 seats to defend (provided that they hold a Mississippi seat in a special-election runoff) while the Democrats will have just 12. If Democrats were disappointed Tuesday night, they can hope that the 2020 Senate elections will be a mirror image of 2018.\n\nTrump behavior has consequences\n\nThe new Democratic majority in the House will include aggressive progressives who want to take tough action against President Donald Trump. There may even be pressure for impeaching him \u2014 the political equivalence of juggling hand grenades. Twenty years ago, Republicans suffered when they impeached President Bill Clinton in defiance of public opinion. And although Trump is not as popular as Clinton was, there is no public consensus for his removal.\n\nSo how can House Democrats satisfy their anti-Trump hawks without alienating rank-and-file voters? One way is to launch committee investigations into misconduct throughout the executive branch. There will be plenty to work with. Some high officials have already had to resign in disgrace, and they surely represent just a tiny sample of the massive rot beneath the surface. Rep. Adam Schiff of California is in line to chair the House Intelligence Committee, which will now do serious oversight and uncover aspects of the Russia story from which the previous majority averted its eyes.\n\nMore: Election results 2018: Bragging rights for everybody and nobody\n\nForget the blue wave and behold the purple puddle\n\nHow Republican Mike Braun won Indiana's Senate seat\n\nAnother simple step is to seek Trump\u2019s tax returns, and Democrats would not even need a subpoena. \"Upon written request from the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives,\u201d says the U.S. Code, the secretary of the Treasury \u201cshall furnish such committee with any return or return information specified in such request.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers would try to resist such a request, but at very least it would put him on the political defensive.\n\nAnd if Democrats really want to sting the president, they can invite him to deliver his State of the Union message in written form only. Although the Constitution requires the chief executive to give Congress \u201cinformation of the State of the Union,\u201d it says nothing about an oral address, much less the television extravaganza that it has become.\n\nUntil President Woodrow Wilson, most presidents just sent over a written message. It would be a break with tradition to deny the president access to the House floor, but this president has himself shredded many norms and traditions. This step would remind him that his behavior has consequences.\n\nJohn J. Pitney Jr. is a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College.

(AP) \u2014 Luguentz Dort was nervous in his first collegiate game and it showed. Shots clanged off the rim, so did free throws, he got sped up.\n\nOnce Dort shook off those early-game jitters, he shot himself into Arizona State's record book.\n\nDort had 28 points to set a freshman opening-game school record and grabbed nine rebounds, helping Arizona State outlast Cal State Fullerton 102-94 in double overtime Tuesday night in both teams' season opener.\n\nDort was 1 for 7 from the floor in the first half, but came alive after halftime, making 8 of 15 shots. He scored on a three-point play off a putback with 2 minutes left in the second overtime to put Arizona State up 95-89 and played well defensively most of the night.\n\n\"I was a little nervous and I talked to coach Hurley and the other coaches, and they told me to calm down, the game would come to me,\" Dort said. \"The second half, everything was good for me.\"\n\nPlaying its first game with a new lineup, Arizona State got off to a slow start, traded baskets with Fullerton in the second half and made big plays in the overtime periods to open Bobby Hurley's fourth season with a win.\n\nKimani Lawrence added 16 points and had a key rebound in overtime for the Sun Devils.\n\n\"I thought it was great the way we battled,\" Hurley said. \"We faced a lot of adversity, have a lot of things to clean up and get better at. But I'm proud of the way the guys battled to stay in the fight and get into a victory.\n\nArizona State did most of its damage on the glass. The Sun Devils had 16 more rebounds and scored 19 second-chance points off 20 offensive boards, helping offset a 26-for-44 night at the free-throw line.\n\nKyle Allman had 35 points and Khalil Ahmad 31 for the Titans, who played without starting forward Jackson Rowe.\n\n\"Our guys competed. I was proud that they competed,\" said Fullerton coach Dedrique Taylor, a former Arizona State assistant. \"We set the standard, so now it's can we maintain that moving forward, that is the biggest thing for us.\"\n\nArizona State reached the NCAA Tournament a year ago behind a trio of senior guards who turned the Sun Devils into Guard U. Tra Holder, Kodi Justice and Shannon Evans II all graduated and now Arizona State has become Big Guard U, with a bigger group of guards to go with added size and depth on the front line.\n\nThe Sun Devils' new lineup was put to the test right away against the Titans, who have nearly everyone back from a team that reached the NCAA Tournament for the third time in program history.\n\nBoth teams seemed to have the first-game jitters, Arizona State more than Fullerton.\n\nThe Sun Devils needed more than 4 1/2 minutes to score, missing their first nine shots before Romello White hit a jump hook.\n\nThe Titans were only marginally better and the Sun Devils put together a couple of short runs while building the lead to nine.\n\nFullerton rallied behind Ahmad, who had 11 points to pull the Titans within 34-31 at halftime.\n\n\"It's college basketball,\" Taylor said. \"You're going to have first-game jitters.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nCal State Fullerton lost, but played well until the second overtime in a hostile road environment.\n\nArizona State's new lineup withstood a stiff test from a good team filled with veteran players.\n\nKEY REBOUND\n\nLawrence had arguably the game's biggest rebound with 1:45 seconds left in the first overtime. With the Sun Devils trailing by four, Lawrence swooped in to grab Dort's missed free throws and was fouled. Lawrence hit his two free throws to give Arizona State an opportunity to tie it.\n\n\"We practiced that this week,\" Lawrence said. \"It's a little play we've got to get the offensive board we draw up. It worked every time in practice and I had confidence it would work in the game.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCal State Fullerton hosts West Coast Baptist on Saturday.\n\nArizona State hosts Long Beach State on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Democrats regained some ground, but it wasn\u2019t the overwhelming repudiation of President Donald Trump and the Republicans they were hoping for.\n\nAs I write this, it looks as if Democrats will control the House of Representatives by a narrow margin, while the GOP keeps control of the Senate. What does that mean? Gridlock.\n\nIs that good? It just might be.\n\nThe idea that gridlock is good is based on the notion that most of what Congress does is probably bad, and that when Congress can\u2019t do much we\u2019re better off. As Bill Kort wrote in 2017, \u201cGridlock is good because when Congress is tied up in knots they can\u2019t do anything to hurt us. This idea has been verified by the market many times over the past 25 years.\u201d\n\nGridlock in Congress can be a good thing\n\nKort notes that the economic boom of the 1990s took place after Clinton was forced to moderate his approach post-1994, and that times of government unity often lead to bad decisions. Under divided government, things have to appeal to both parties or they don\u2019t pass. That will take a lot, given how divided the parties are.\n\nBut Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that \"divided government is the perfect time to do big things.\" Pointing to Social Security reform in 1983, the 1986 Tax Reform Act, and the Clinton-era welfare reform program, McConnell said, \u201cNone of those things in my view would have occurred in unified government.\"\n\nThere are a lot of things that need to be done, ranging from infrastructure, to trade, to a health care fix that will get us past the Obamacare debacle. They won\u2019t get addressed unless the two parties can come together. I think there\u2019s room for them to work together \u2014 and former Democratic National Committee Chair Ed Rendell was saying the same thing on election night on Fox News. It\u2019ll be interesting to see whether President Trump can bring some of his famed \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d skills into play.\n\nMore: Election results 2018: Bragging rights for everybody and nobody\n\nThe Senate is failing America. Elect Democrats to reduce acrimony, negotiate with Trump\n\nIf you want to fix the polarization crisis, use your vote to shift the political climate\n\nFor Trump, at least, there are some upsides to a Democratic-controlled House. If, as expected, the leadership consists of people like Nancy Pelosi, Jerrold Nadler, Adam Schiff and Maxine Waters, Trump will have a useful array of foils. He\u2019ll have to balance his desire to use them as convenient enemies in the run-up to 2020 and his need to work with them to produce some sort of legislative achievement.\n\nLikewise, the Democrats will have to decide whether to weaponize the House via investigations and subpoenas or to work with the president. Rendell strongly encouraged the latter, but the party\u2019s Trump-hating base will strongly favor the former. On the other hand, the Trump-hating base failed to produce the promised Blue Wave.\n\nThe federal government is too powerful\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s a bigger lesson, as brought home by satire site The Babylon Bee, which wrote, \"Nation torn apart by routine election starting to wonder if government may be too powerful.\"\n\nAs the nation was torn apart by a relatively mundane, routine midterm election, just like the ones that regularly occur every four years, Americans began to wonder if a government in which such a commonplace election can impact so many lives in so many ways might just be a little bit too powerful. The nation suddenly realized that a government holding elections that threaten far-reaching changes in each and every person's private life could actually need to be downsized a tad. \"I was starting to wonder why we were all at each other's throats,\" said one Democratic voter in Oregon. \"And then it hit me: The politicians and policies we're voting on could shake up who has the government's blessings for the next few years, and which groups will get left out. And then I was like, 'Whoa. Maybe if the government weren't so huge and bloated, we wouldn't care about elections that much.' \" He then dismissed the idea as \"crazy talk,\" however.\n\nYes, it\u2019s a satire site, but is this really satire? And no, the idea isn\u2019t \u201ccrazy talk.\u201d\n\nThe outcome of national elections is such a big deal because the federal government possesses such far reaching power over people\u2019s lives. When the Constitution was drafted, James Madison told us that the powers of the federal government were \u201cfew and defined.\u201d And that was true then.\n\nIt\u2019s not true now, and people get upset over the idea of the other party in power more because they fear what the federal government might do to them than because they have hopes for what the federal government might do for them. An oversize, overreaching federal government really is tearing us apart. Gridlock is only a temporary solution to that.\n\nIf we do something to shrink the federal government, we\u2019ll likely make things better. Is that crazy talk? Maybe. But it\u2019s also true.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of \"The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself,\" is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

Davis' dunk made it 92-74 with 4:15 to play.\n\nThe Nets' strategy seemed to be to let the 7-foot-1 Ayton shoot mid-range shots rather than allow him to work inside the paint.

(AP Photo/Brandon Wade) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDALLAS (AP) \u2014 The Mavericks have had the Washington Wizards' number in recent years, and Dallas' young backcourt ensured that remained the case Tuesday night.\n\nLuka Doncic scored 23 points and Dennis Smith Jr. made three key plays down the stretch as the Mavericks ended a six-game losing streak by beating Washington 119-100.\n\nIt was the Mavericks' 16th win in their last 17 meetings with the Wizards. In the first half, when Dallas built a 24-point lead, it looked like a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe Wizards climbed back within six midway through the fourth quarter, but Smith scooted past Dwight Howard to grab an offensive rebound and fed a cutting DeAndre Jordan for a dunk that put the Mavs up 101-93 with 5:33 left.\n\nJust 30 seconds later, the pair collaborated again on a pretty alley-oop, then Smith stole the ball from Bradley Beal near half-court and got it to Harrison Barnes for a three-point play and a 13-point lead.\n\n\"This is where you've got to trust your players,\" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. \"Dennis has earned the trust. He's seeing things, and those plays were real pivotal plays in the game and it kept them at a distance.\"\n\nSmith finished with 19 points and seven assists. Wesley Matthews added 22 points for Dallas, and Barnes had 19 points and 13 rebounds.\n\nJohn Wall led the Wizards with 24 points. Otto Porter Jr. and Beal had 19 each, but Beal was 1 for 9 on 3-point attempts. Washington was just 11 for 35 on 3s.\n\n\"We just didn't make shots and we didn't communicate well in transition,\" Wall said. \"In the third quarter, we did a better job of playing with intensity. I just feel like maybe eight, 10 wide-open 3s, we just missed and still had a chance down six in the fourth quarter with five minutes to go.\"\n\nDoncic scored 13 in the first half, including a rainbow 3 just before the halftime buzzer to put Dallas up 70-49. It was the Mavs' highest first-half output of the young season.\n\nWashington started the third quarter strong, with Beal scoring seven points in a 12-4 run to pull within 13. Porter had three 3s in the quarter, the last in the final seconds to bring the Wizards within single digits for the first time since the first period.\n\nTHREE FEELS GOOD\n\nWhile Dallas is just 3-7, the Mavericks won their third game considerably sooner than the previous two seasons \u2014 they started 2-14 last year and 2-13 in 2016-17.\n\nBACK IN FORM\n\nBarnes delivered his first double-double of the season in a strong performance after missing the first four games of the year due to a right hamstring strain.\n\nBarnes credits having played with great players at Golden State before coming to Dallas and now having a role model in teammate Dirk Nowitzki.\n\n\"The biggest thing I've learned from them is to do it by example every single day,\" Barnes said. \"To come in, to put the work in, and let that speak for itself.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nWizards: Coach Scott Brooks reminisced about Dallas counterpart Rick Carlisle, his roommate in the CBA in 1987. \"He doesn't get a lot of credit for being a great player,\" Brooks said. When pressed by skeptical reporters about his claim, Brooks drew laughter by arguing that he would recognize greatness because: \"I WAS a great player. I was better than a lot of guys that you're asking me about and a lot of guys that tried to make it,\" he said.\n\nMavericks: Devin Harris missed his ninth straight game with a left hamstring strain. Carlisle said Harris wouldn't play before the weekend at the earliest. ... Jordan had 12 rebounds and has been in double digits in all 10 games with the Mavs. ...

What\u2019s this guy worth?\u2019\u2018\u2019\n\nThe tricky part, Van Wagenen acknowledged to his new peer group, is that he has players throughout the game that have become close friends. He must be cautious with tampering rules. And with seven former clients on the Mets, well, how would you like to be the guy telling them they are being traded or can\u2019t get that lucrative contract extension?\n\n\u201cWe told him we\u2019d be concerned,\u2019\u2019 Levine said, \u201cif he offered any of them in a trade. And he said, 'Well, not as concerned as my owner would be if I asked to pay them significantly more than they\u2019re worth.' So it will be interesting to see how he deals with that.\n\n\u201cHe told us about the volume of players he had in their system that he used to represent, which makes him very knowledgeable about them, but it also puts him in a little bit of a tough spot relative to how he wants to treat those assets.\u2019\u2019\n\nYet, if there were any fear of resentfulness or even awkwardness, they have vanished into the night. Several agents who had private meetings with Van Wagenen say they went quite smooth. Rival teams echoed the sentiments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been fun,\u2019\u2019 Van Wagenen said. \u201cThe conversations with club officials have been warm, and some humor and laughter with the role reversal, and the report has been maintained so far with the agent meetings. They\u2019ve been professional, but also transparent with both sides understanding the needs of each other.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely different in the fact I have a different goal in mind, but the communication about trying to assess player talent and identify player values is pretty consistent to what I was doing before.\u2019\u2019\n\nIf first impressions mean anything, Van Wagenen certainly has made a whole lot of doubters into believers.\n\n\u201cI was kind of curious to hear his approach to everything,\u2019\u2019 Texas Rangers president and GM Jon Daniels said, \u201cand I was impressed. I think it will be business as usual pretty quickly. He\u2019s going to do the best thing for the Mets, just as he did the best thing for his clients. We all have jobs to do, it doesn\u2019t matter what he was doing beforehand.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut what about those agents who were bitter rivals with Van Wagenen, who feuded in the past, and aren\u2019t about to let those feelings simply go.\n\n\u201cCome on, what are the other agents going to tell their client,\u2019\u2019 Daniels said. \u201cAre they going to eliminate a bidder? No way.\u2019\u2019\n\nIndeed, there wasn\u2019t a single GM who publicly scoffed at the idea of Van Wagenen being able to handle the job. No one, even privately, said they were hoping this outside-the-box move would backfire.\n\n\u201cWhen you think of his baseball background, or baseball knowledge and IQ, whether you do it as an agent or running a team,\u2019\u2019 St. Louis Cardinals president John Mozeliak said, \u201cisn\u2019t all that different. Instead of talking about potential free agents, he might be talking about potential trades.\n\n\u201cLook, we all live in glass houses, so careful what you say, or what you predict.\u2019\u2019\n\nBesides, several GMs said, it\u2019s hardly as if any of them had an adversarial relationship with Van Wagenen. He needed them, and they needed him, with Van Wagenen representing some of the biggest names in the game.\n\nSays Red Sox president and GM David Dombrowski: \u201cIt\u2019s a unique challenge. It will be interesting to see how it works.\u2019\u2019\n\nThen again, if this does work, who knows, does Van Wagenen becomes a trendsetter? This is a copy-cat industry. We could have more agents switching sides if the Mets suddenly find themselves back in the postseason.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s incredibly smart, capable, and a passionate baseball person,\u2019\u2019 Houston Astros GM Jeff Luhnow said.\n\n\u201cA year from now, we\u2019re not even going to remember he was an agent.\u2019\u2019\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "Gonzaga guard Corey Kispert watches his three pointer find the basket over Idaho State forward Chier Maker in the first half of an NCAA college basketball game Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Spokane, Wash.

Lard averaged 12.6 points and 8.1 rebounds a game in 2017-18, and his presence will be crucial for a team that missed the NCAA Tournament a year ago.\n\nIowa State coach Steve Prohm said he'll re-evaluate Lard and Talley's status after the team returns from the Maui Invitational later this month.\n\n\"With Cameron, first and foremost it's my job \u2014 and not just as a basketball coach here, but as a leader of men \u2014 to continue to challenge him to grow...he's making good strides. Really, really good strides,\" Prohm said. \"But, there's accountability for actions.\"\n\nAs for the game itself, Shayok scored eight points in the opening 2:10 to help the Cyclones take an early double-digit lead it never came close to relinquishing.\n\nIowa State struggled at times from there as it worked freshmen Talen Horton-Tucker, Tyrese Haliburton, George Conditt IV and Zion Griffin into the rotation for the first time. But a lineup featuring Haliburton, Lewis and Griffin sparked a late 19-5 run, with Haliburton canning a 3 to make it 65-41 with just over six minutes left.\n\nHaliburton scored 12 points in 29 minutes.\n\n\"I thought our energy with that one group in the second half was a big difference,\" Prohm said.\n\nReginald Gee had 15 points to lead Alabama State (0-1).\n\nTHE BIG PICTURE\n\nIowa State: Horton-Tucker started, but he got off to a very sluggish start in his debut. He missed six of his first seven shots \u2014 including four 3s \u2014 and finished 3-of-12 shooting for six points. Horton-Tucker went 0 for 5 on 3s, but Prohm said he's been shooting about 40 percennt beyond the arc. Shayok, on the other hand, looked like the perimeter threat the Cyclones had been searching for, adding six rebounds and three assists.\n\nAlabama State: The Cyclones will likely prove to be the toughest team the Hornets, coming off back-to-back 8-23 seasons, will play all year. At least they got it out of the way as soon as possible.\n\nTHE FRESHMEN\n\nHaliburton, the 6-foot-5 but rail-thin point guard out of Wisconsin, was the first player off the bench for the Cyclones. Haliburton showed impressive length and slashing ability, and he also finished with four assists and four steals. The 6-foot-10 Conditt had five points and four blocks in 14 minutes and Griffin, who didn't play until the second half after battling knee issues all summer, had four rebounds.\n\nPIVOTAL MOMENT\n\nThe Hornets actually gave Iowa State a bit of trouble midway through the first half, pulling to within 24-17. But Jacobson rescued a frantic possession with an elbow 3 and then grabbed a loose ball in the paint for an easy basket. Wigginton followed with a 3 and the outcome was never in doubt from there \u2014 though, to be fair, it never really was to begin with.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\"I'm just going to try and keep bringing the energy that I have and the leadership that I can bring.

Franklin, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Former Dodgers general manager Farhan Zaidi is the new president of baseball operations for the San Francisco Giants.\n\nThe Giants announced the hiring Tuesday night and planned a formal introduction at AT&T Park on Wednesday, a day before they hold a public celebration of life for late Hall of Famer Willie McCovey.\n\nBaseball executives are meeting this week for the GM meetings in Carlsbad, California, and Giants CEO Larry Baer knew it might take this long to find the right person to push the department in a fresh direction.\n\nZaidi just completed his fourth year as GM for Los Angeles. His Dodgers won a sixth straight NL West title and lost in the World Series each of the past two seasons.\n\n\"We set out to find one of the best minds in baseball and Farhan's many accomplishments and expertise exceeded our expectations,\" Baer said. \"Farhan is widely viewed as one of the top executives in our industry and we are thrilled to have him lead the next chapter of Giants baseball.\"\n\nIn November 2014, the Canadian-born Zaidi departed his job as assistant GM of the Oakland Athletics to lead the Dodgers under Andrew Friedman. Zaidi earned his bachelor's degree in economics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1998 and a PhD in economics from the University of California at Berkeley in 2011.\n\nSo, Zaidi brings more of an analytical emphasis and strength. The Giants sought to upgrade their baseball operations department and take a \"fresh approach,\" as Baer put it.\n\n\"I am delighted to return to the Bay Area and to join one of the most storied franchises in the game,\" said Zaidi, who turns 42 this coming Sunday. \"I have watched the Giants from afar and I have great respect for the organization's culture and many accomplishments. I am excited about this new opportunity and I'm looking forward to getting right to work.\"\n\nZaidi is expected to have the flexibility to hire someone as GM under him. He spent 10 seasons with Oakland and received plenty of responsibility on Billy Beane's staff, such as playing a key role in the acquisition of Cuban slugger Yoenis Cespedes before the 2012 season.\n\nThe Giants dismissed GM Bobby Evans in September. San Francisco \u2014 which won World Series championships in 2010, '12 and '14 \u2014 went 73-89 in 2018 and went a majors-worst 5-21 in September to miss the playoffs for a second straight year and third in four seasons.\n\nWith the A's, Zaidi's areas of expertise included providing statistical analysis for evaluating and targeting players in the amateur draft, free agent and trade markets. He also worked on arbitration cases, minor league contracts and worked closely with coaches to analyze data from advance scouting reports.\n\nZaidi previously served as business development associate for Small World Media, the fantasy sports division of The Sporting News, and also worked as a management consultant for the Boston Consulting Group.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle first reported the hiring Tuesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

North Carolina won 78-67. (AP Photo/Bob Leverone) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) \u2014 When Roy Williams pulled Luke Maye late in the first half for taking a bad shot, the Atlantic Coast Conference's preseason player of the year didn't pout or get angry on the bench.\n\nMaye instead responded with a solid second half, scoring a game-high 24 points as No. 8 North Carolina defeated Wofford 78-67 on Tuesday to avenge an upset loss last year to the Terriers.\n\n\"Coach does a great job of treating everybody equally and not playing favorites,\" said Maye, who finished 7 of 13 from the field and 8 of 9 from the foul line. \"He wants to make sure people understand when they are making a mistake. That's the biggest thing he prides himself on and I love him for it.\"\n\nMaye was solid throughout, and Cameron Johnson provided a huge spark in the second half as the Tar Heels improved to 15-1 in season openers under Williams.\n\nAfter Wofford battled back to tie the game at 46 with 10:33 left on a pair of 3-pointers from sharpshooter Fletcher McGee, Johnson buried three 3s in a span of three minutes to put the Tar Heels ahead for good. Johnson finished 5 of 7 from beyond the arc and had 17 points and eight rebounds.\n\nJohnson said he had this game circled on his calendar. The Pittsburgh transfer's first game in a Tar Heels uniform last season following a knee injury came against Wofford, and it didn't go well.\n\n\"That broke my heart,\" said Johnson, who displayed a confident stroke on his long jumpers. \"So I have been eyeing this game for a very long time. This is one I really wanted.\"\n\nIt was the seventh time overall that Johnson has knocked in five or more 3-pointers. He's done it three times since joining North Carolina.\n\nGarrison Brooks added a career-high 20 points for North Carolina and Kenny Williams was solid defensively, making things extremely difficult for McGee in the first half.\n\nWofford was hoping for another upset.\n\nThe Terriers visited Chapel Hill, North Carolina, last December and stunned then-No. 6 UNC 79-75 behind 27 points from McGee, the Southern Conference's 2017-18 player of the year. This time the Tar Heels invaded the 3,400-seat Jerry Richardson Indoor Stadium, which opened in 2017, and pulled away late in the second half.\n\nMcGee finished with 21 points despite missing his first seven shots and not scoring until late in the first half. Wofford shot just 9 of 35 from 3-point range.\n\n\"We missed a lot of shots,\" Wofford coach Mike Young said.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nWofford: The Terriers proved (again) they can play with the nation's best. They can take heart in knowing that most of the teams they will play in the Southern Conference don't have as much length as North Carolina. The future is bright for a team that returns most of its players from last season and is picked to finish second in the Southern Conference.\n\nNorth Carolina: One of the biggest questions for the Tar Heels is who will replace Joel Berry at point guard. Freshman Coby White got the start and struggled early on with two turnovers but turned it on down the stretch, making a key 3-pointer from the corner while converting a couple of drives. He finished with eight points and three assists. \"I just had first-game jitters,\" White said. Seventh Woods backed up White and had two points and three assists. Williams said that other than a few turnovers, he was pleased with both of his point guards. \"Both of them will play,\" Williams said. \"If I were a football coach I would play two quarterbacks every game, too.\"\n\nCAREER HIGH: Along with posting a career high 20 points, Brooks \u2014 who started at the forward spot opposite Maye \u2014 earned a distinction of being the only Tar Heel player not to get yelled at by his coach at halftime. \"There's a reason he's getting to start,\" Williams said.\n\nBrooks said he was motivated by UNC's loss last year to Wofford. \"I take everything personal,\" Brooks said. \"If you want to win, you want to be the best, you have to take it personal.\"\n\nINJURY SCARE: Kenny Williams left holding his right shoulder late in the game but did return. Roy Williams said the senior guard had full range of motion in the shoulder so he sent him back in. The coach noted that Kenny Williams probably will be sore on Wednesday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNorth Carolina: At Elon on Friday\n\nWofford: At High Point on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It was Kreider's seventh goal, and third in four games.\n\nNOTES: Domi scored against the Rangers for the first time in six career games against them. His goal gave him nine tallies and 13 points in his last 11 games. ... Tatar had his second two-goal game of the season. He also scored twice as part of a three-point game against Pittsburgh on Oct. 13. ... The teams play two more times this season, at Montreal on Dec. 1 and back in New York on March 1. ...

(AP) \u2014 Glynn Watson, Jr. scored 19 points to lead Nebraska, which led by as many as 72, over cold-shooting Mississippi Valley State 106-37 Tuesday.\n\nThe 67-point victory margin was Nebraska's largest at Pinnacle Bank Arena. The 106 points were the most the Huskers have scored at the five-year-old arena and the 37 points the fewest scored by a Nebraska opponent there.\n\nNebraska held the outmanned Delta Devils to just one field goal in the game's first 10 minutes, using a 21-3 run to take a 24-5 lead on Thorir Thorbjarnarson's fast break layup with 11:01 left in the first half. The Huskers shot 63 percent in the game's first 9 minutes.\n\nMississippi Valley State made only three field goals in the first half, shooting just nine percent over the long, athletic Huskers. The Delta Devils reached double digits in scoring at the 5:07 mark on a layup by Dante Scott, their last basket of the period. MVSU's 13 points tied a Pinnacle Bank Arena record for the fewest points scored in a half.\n\nThe MVSU cold shooting continued in the second half, missing their first four shots as Nebraska went 8-0 and took a 63-13 on Palmer's dunk with 17:39 left. The Delta Devils hit just 13 of 68 shots in the game, 19 percent, a Pinnacle Bank Arena opponent record low.\n\nNebraska coach Tim Miles said he thought his team played well, despite the lop-sided nature of the game.\n\n\"I thought the guys respected the game, played hard throughout the game,\" Miles said. \"I thought Glynn was really good, James Palmer put up a great line...I thought we did a lot of things right tonight. Sometimes after a game like this you don't feel good, whatever. But I thought our guys just hung in there and kept doing the right things for a long time.\"\n\nOn the other side, Mississippi Valley State coach Andre Payne said he could find little good with the Delta Devils' performance.\n\n\"There wasn't a whole lot that I liked from today,\" Payne said. \"Tonight was a reality check. These guys are really that good, they're really that tall, they're really that long, they're really that athletic and they really shoot it that well... We have to learn that we have to be 10 times smarter. Play 10 times harder. Make 10 times less mistakes in order for us to compete.\"\n\nAlso scoring in double figures for Nebraska were Nana Akenten with 18 points, James Palmer, Jr with 17 points and Isaac Copeland with 10 points. Jordan Evans led Mississippi Valley State with 12 points. Scott had 10 for the Delta Devils.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nNebraska won its 18th straight season opener and 28th straight home season opener. The Huskers last season-opening loss came at Oral Roberts in 1990.\n\nThe margin of victory was the second largest in Nebraska history. The largest was 74 in a game against Crete in 1907.\n\nMississippi Valley State returns three starters from last year's 4-28 team, aiming to build around the 3-point shooting of seniors Scott and Evans.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNebraska hosts Southeastern Louisiana Sunday in the second game of the Lincoln regional round of the Hall of Fame Classic.\n\nMississippi Valley State will face Texas Tech in Lubbock Friday in the second of five consecutive road games to open the season.\n\n________________\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Terrill, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Agent John Boggs stood in the lobby at the hotel hosting the general managers' meetings and talked about last winter, when dozens of free agents remained unsigned after spring training began, causing prices to plummet as opening day approached.\n\n\"It's the greatest thing for the owners because they've got a lot of players that are wanting to play and have a lot of game left in them, and all of a sudden are just sitting there dying to get an opportunity again, and so it's a gigantic Macy's basement sale,\" he said. \"I hope it is an aberration because I think there's a lot of good players that are being deprived of getting an opportunity to continue their careers.\"\n\nAs the offseason starts, teams and agents aren't sure whether the market will revert to its previous pace or whether clubs will try to wait out players again.\n\nMiami's efforts to trade Giancarlo Stanton and Shohei Ohtani's decision to leave Japan for the major leagues created roadblocks after the 2017 season.\n\n\"I think the lesson to be drawn is don't hold your vacation off until late January, because everybody seemed to be pretty busy last year,\" Texas Rangers president of baseball operations Jon Daniels said.\n\nThis year's free-agent class is a far stronger group, led by outfielders Bryce Harper, A.J. Pollock and Michael Brantley, infielders Manny Machado and Josh Donaldson, starting pitchers Dallas Keuchel, Patrick Corbin, Hyun-Jin Ryu and Nathan Eovaldi, and closers Craig Kimbrel and Zach Britton.\n\n\"The good ones will get their money,\" Philadelphia GM Matt Klentak said. \"They'll sign. They'll end up in good places. And whether that's here in November or whether it's in December, January, February or even March, I don't know.\"\n\nWashington GM Mike Rizzo said the Nationals attempted to reach a deal with Harper before he became a free agent.\n\n\"We utilized our exclusivity to negotiate with him late in the season through when he became eligible to sign with a team,\" Rizzo said. \"There is a reality that we would love to sign him but we may not.\"\n\nSome teams have delayed their offseason planning because of front-office changes. Los Angeles Dodgers GM Farhan Zaidi was hired just Tuesday as San Francisco's president of baseball operations and Baltimore has not replaced Dan Duquette as its top baseball decision-maker.\n\nBrodie Van Wagenen, who had been an agent at CAA Baseball, replaced Sandy Alderson as the New York Mets' general manager. About two weeks before the start of spring training last winter, Van Wagenen suggested players considering boycotting spring training because of the slow market.\n\n\"Hard to say about whether there will be any carry-over effect to this year,\" he said. \"I think there was an element last year where the trade market was slowed, as well, which also pushed the free-agent market back.\"\n\nTeams now project their rosters well into the future, and players who could be free agents after the 2019 World Series could be dealt this offseason for a bigger return than they would get ahead of next summer's trade deadline, especially if they don't agree to long-term deals. Among the possibilities are Arizona first baseman Paul Goldschmidt, Colorado third baseman Nolan Arenado, San Francisco left-hander Madison Bumgarner and Mets right-hander Zack Wheeler.\n\nArizona general manager Mike Hazen said a multiyear deal with Goldschmidt would take creativity, and a trade had to be considered.\n\n\"He's the consummate teammate, Diamondback. What he's done for the organization both on and off the field is everything you want in a player,\" Hazen said. \"I met with Paul. I think there's an understanding of where the organization is at present. But I think it would pretty tough.\"\n\nCC Sabathia became the first free agent to reach a deal since the market opened Saturday, agreeing to an $8 million, one-year contract with the New York Yankees. The 38-year-old left-hander accepted a $2 million cut to return to the Bronx for an 11th season in a deal subject to a successful physical.\n\nNew York is being more aggressive this offseason after falling below the luxury tax threshold for the first time in 2018.\n\n\"Last year we had to be really careful about every step we took in terms of financial commitments, so it took longer because we were having to have that luxury-tax issue in the back of our minds,\" general manager Brian Cashman said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers dropped below the threshold for the first time since 2012 and won their second straight NL pennant \u2014 but lost the World Series for the second consecutive year. The only teams projected over this year were the World Series champion Boston Red Sox, who had the highest payroll for the first time in the free-agent era, and Washington.\n\nAlan Nero, who negotiated first baseman Carlos Santana's $60 million, three-year deal with the Phillies last fall, said agents have to be realistic with their clients.\n\n\"I think you have to understand we're in a changing market and you're not going to get a 10-year deal,\" he said. \"It's a matter of managing expectations.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writer Janie McCauey and AP freelance writer Jay Paris contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Isaiah Washington added 11 assists off the bench.\n\nZach Jackson led the Mavericks with 21 points, and Mitch Hahn had 14 points and five rebounds. J.T. Gibson, one of four returning starters and a native of Minnesota who starred at Champlin Park High School in the Twin Cities area, added 10 points for Omaha.\n\nCoffey, who played on the wing in his first two seasons and missed 14 games as a sophomore because of a shoulder injury, brought the ball up the court for much of the game in light of the departure of four-year standout Nate Mason. The 6-foot-8 Coffey, who had four assists, went 5 for 7 from the field and made all eight of his free throws. He played some at the shooting guard and small forward spots, but his size, calm and savviness makes Coffey a strong leader of the offense, with Washington as the top sub.\n\n\"When he decides to be aggressive he's a totally different person, so we need that Amir all the time,\" McBrayer said.\n\nMcBrayer gritted through a trying junior season with a stress reaction in his shin bone, as the Gophers sputtered to a 15-17 finish. His return to good health will be a big boost for the backcourt.\n\n\"When he's healthy, he's a really, really good guard,\" Pitino said.\n\nThe Mavericks went more than 6\u00bd minutes into the game without a field goal, including a missed dunk by Matt Pile, until Jackson finally knocked down a jumper in the paint. That gave them a jolt, because they used a 19-6 run capped by a 3-pointer from Gibson to take a 22-20 lead.\n\nOturu, the prize of an all-Minnesota freshman class along with wings Gabe Kalscheur and Jarvis Omersa, had a pair of putbacks, two rebounds and a blocked shot in the final 90 seconds of the first half to help the Gophers pull away. Coffey, fouled behind the arc at the buzzer by Ayo Akinwole, made three free throws for a 50-31 lead at the break.\n\n\"Some athleticism caught up to us. Oturu got us on a couple things, some high-major plays that we can't control,\" Mavericks coach Derrin Hansen said.\n\nNOT THIS TIME\n\nThree years ago, the Mavericks gave the Gophers a scare on the day after Thanksgiving in 2015 when Gibson and Jackson were freshmen. Omaha pulled within one point with 24 seconds left, and Minnesota missed five of its final eight free throw attempts before pulling out a 93-90 victory.\n\nThis was Omaha's ninth game against a Big Ten opponent since moving to Division I in 2011. The Mavericks have won once, at Iowa on Dec. 3, 2016.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nOmaha: Coming off a 9-22 record in 2017-18 and predicted in the preseason Summit League poll to finish eighth out of nine, the Mavericks play their first of five road games against power-conference opponents on the 2018-19 schedule. In upcoming trips to Colorado, Iowa State, Arizona State and 14th-ranked Oregon, they have experience and balance to be competitive, but depth and length are limited. They were outrebounded 41-21, and the Gophers had a 35-18 edge in bench scoring.\n\nMinnesota: Washington, the jewel of last year's class who had a rocky first season, found Omersa with lob passes for a pair of second-half dunks that brought the small crowd of 8,883 to a roar.\n\n\"Just staying confident, bringing joy to the team, keeping the energy going, trying to keep my guys level-headed,\" Washington said.\n\nThe Gophers might have played at too slow of a pace last season, Pitino said, for Washington to thrive.\n\n\"Isaiah learned how to play basketball by watching the NBA,\" Pitino said. \"I think you can tell that.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOmaha: Plays Buena Vista, a Division III school in Iowa, in the home opener on Friday afternoon.\n\nMinnesota: Hosts Utah on Monday night, the first-ever visit by the Utes to Williams Arena.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He produced a point, a rebound, a steal and an assist in nine minutes as the Longhorns defeated Eastern Illinois 71-59 in the season opener.\n\n\"It's great to see Andrew out on the court,\" Texas coach Shaka Smart said. \"I loved the way the crowd and everyone in the building reacted to him going in the game.\"\n\nHow much Jones gets to play this season is uncertain. Jones, who was not made available to reporters on Tuesday, will leave the team temporarily on Dec. 10 to undergo another round of chemotherapy.

After we settled down, we did fine.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nEastern Illinois: The Panthers, picked to finish seventh in the 12-team Ohio Valley Conference by the league's coaches and sports information directors, need time to coalesce. They have four new starters, all junior college transfers. The 6-foot-9 Kukobat is one of them.

He missed with his only shot attempt in the second half.\n\nTexas: The Longhorns won't provide a full glimpse of themselves until they face Arkansas on Friday. Senior guard Kerwin Roach II missed the opener while serving a one-game suspension for a violation of unspecified team rules several months ago. Roach averaged 12.3 points a game last season, fourth best on the team, while leading the Longhorns with 47 steals. The Longhorns hit 32 percent of their 3-pointers against Eastern Illinois, the same accuracy that ranked last in the Big 12 last season.\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nTexas struggled for most of the first half but made a 15-0 push toward the end to take a 10-point lead at the break.\n\n\"I think they got real serious about playing,\" Spoonhour said.\n\nElijah Mitrou-Long had a hand in the first 10 of those points, with two driving layups, a 3-point basket, and an assist. Mitrou-Long, a guard averaged 15 points a game at Mount St. Mary's in 2016-17 before transferring to Texas and sitting out last season.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nNone. The Longhorns, 19-15 last season, received only five votes in The Associated Press preseason 25 poll, landing them in 45th place.\n\nINJURY UPDATE\n\nEastern Illinois guard Terrell Lewis is back for his second senior season after receiving a medical redshirt from the NCAA.

(Colin Murphey/The Daily Astorian via AP) ORG XMIT: ORAST701 (Photo: Colin Murphey, AP)\n\nIn one of the biggest Democratic victories of the 2018 election, Florida voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to restore voting rights to an estimated 1.5 million former felons, including roughly 500,000 African-Americans.\n\nElsewhere across the country there were progressive wins for the continued legalization of marijuana, a rejection of the conservative agenda in Oregon and more abortion restrictions passed in red states.\n\nAmendment 4 in Florida applies to felons who served their sentence, including parole and probation, but will not apply to those convicted of murder or sexual offenses. The change is expected to affect future election results in Florida, as well as presidential races, because the state is often seen as competitive in national contests.\n\nMore: Florida amendments: What passed, failed in midterm election\n\nFlorida is one of only four states that permanently disenfranchised former felons.\n\nMeanwhile, Missouri became the 31st state to legalize medical marijuana use Tuesday night with the passage of Amendment 2, according to multiple local media reports.\n\nOther ballot measures closely watched across the nation on Election Day included proposals involving recreational marijuana, abortion and sanctuary state status. Here are the measures and the results:\n\nMarijuana on ballot in four states\n\nMichigan became the first Midwestern state to legalize recreational marijuana, and the 10th state overall to do so, with both CNN and NBC reporting that the state had passed Proposal 1. The initiative creates a system to regulate, tax and sell recreational marijuana to adults in the state.\n\n\u201cWestern and northeastern states have led the way on legalizing marijuana, but the victory in Michigan powerfully demonstrates the national reach of this movement,\u201d Maria McFarland S\u00e1nchez-Moreno, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, said in a statement. \u201cWith such overwhelming public support for marijuana legalization, even including majorities of Republicans and older Americans, there\u2019s only so long that the federal government can continue to hold out.\u201d\n\nCanada, Michigan\u2019s neighbor to the north, legalized marijuana sales for adults in mid-October, which added pressured for Michigan to pass recreational use, too.\n\nIn Missouri, three marijuana-related initiatives were on the ballot. Each of them legalized growing, manufacturing, selling and consuming marijuana and marijuana products for medicinal use at the state level, but differed in terms of how they tax marijuana and the freedom each gives potential home growers.\n\nAmendment 2, the measure that passed, will tax marijuana sales at 4 percent, with the proceeds funding veterans health care programs. Of the three, it was the only proposal that allowed for home-growing of marijuana.\n\n\"Thanks to the unflagging efforts of patients and advocates, Missourians who could benefit from medical marijuana will soon be able to use it without fear of being treated like criminals,\" said Matthew Schweich, deputy director of the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project. \"There is near-universal support in the U.S. for providing seriously ill patients with legal access to medical cannabis. Most voters, regardless of their age, geographic location, or political persuasion, recognize the medical benefits of marijuana and believe it should be available to those who can benefit from it. Now that more than 30 states have enacted comprehensive medical marijuana laws, it is time for Congress to step up and address the issue at the federal level.\"\n\nOther states also were debating legal pot. Late Tuesday, Utah became the 32nd state to legalize medical marijuana use, but North Dakota residents struck down Measure 3, according to the Associated Press. Measure 3 would have been the nation\u2019s most permissive recreational law, allowing residents to grow, consume and possess as much weed as they want, without any government oversight.\n\nMore: Legal marijuana states: Election Day brings pot debate to North Dakota, Utah, Michigan and Missouri voters\n\nOut West, Utah has a complicated relationship with marijuana use when it comes to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is hugely influential in the state. More than 60 percent of the state\u2019s 3 million residents are LDS members.\n\nMore: Marijuana reform: New California law gives people with records a do-over\n\nProp. 2 had strong support in the weeks before the election. But then the LDS church starting running radio ads warning that medical legalization is the first step toward full legalization, which is at odds with a faith that teaches its followers to stay away from alcohol, coffee, tobacco and illegal drugs.\n\nUnder Utah law, lawmakers are able to amend or repeal voter-approved ballot measures, so the LDS church and proponents of Prop. 2 reached an agreement before the election that will amend the language to state that residents are banned from growing their own weed while trying to establish a state-run medical marijuana distribution network. Smoking marijuana will likely remain illegal, but sick people could be able to consume cannabis-infused foods or use vape pens.\n\nSchweich of the Marijuana Policy Project told USA TODAY this month: \u201cThere's a lot of voters who support marijuana in principle but didn't want to go in opposition of the LDS church. The important thing about Utah is that we have made a compromise.\u201d\n\nAnti-abortion measures in three states\n\nElsewhere across the country, voters in West Virginia, Alabama and \u2013 surprisingly \u2013 Oregon voted on measures that would limit abortion.\n\nAlabama passed Amendment 2, according to the Associated Press, which makes it state policy to \u201crecognize and support the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children, including the right to life.\u201d It adds that no provisions of the Alabama Constitution provide the right to an abortion or require funding of abortions.\n\nWest Virginians passed a similar measure with Amendment 1, which will change the language of the West Virginia Constitution to say, \u201cNothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion.\u201d\n\nBut Oregonians lived up to their progressive reputation, soundly defeating Measure 106, according to The Oregonian and Oregon Public Broadcasting.\n\nFramed as a tax debate, Measure 106 would have amended the Oregon Constitution to not allow taxes to be used to pay for any elective abortions.\n\nMore: Fight over abortion comes to Oregon as Republicans target reproductive rights in U.S.\n\nThat means any Oregon Medicaid patients, as well as any employees on state-funded health insurance, would not have had access to abortion. The measure would have impacted roughly 293,000 women, according to data from the Oregon Health Authority.\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum casts his ballot with his 4-year-old twins Caroline, left, and Jackson on Election Day on Nov. 6, 2018, in Tallahassee, Fla.

I\u2019m still so disappointed in what happened in Alabama and that Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court, but we sent a strong message tonight that Oregon will always stand up for reproductive rights.\"\n\nOregon voting on sanctuary state status\n\nAlso in Oregon, residents voted down Measure 105 \u2013 which would have repealed the nation\u2019s oldest sanctuary state law \u2013 according to the AP.\n\nMore: Will liberal Oregon embrace Trump's agenda? Ballot measure seeks to repeal sanctuary law protecting immigrants\n\nOriginally hailed as an anti-racial profiling law in 1987, Oregon\u2019s sanctuary status has fallen under heavy criticism from President Donald Trump, as well as Oregonians for Immigration Reform, backers of the initiative. In Oregon, 18 sheriffs from smaller counties signed a letter in support of passing Measure 105.

Joe Manchin attends a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing on July 26, 2017. (Photo: Michael Reynolds, European Pressphoto Agency)\n\nCHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 Democrat Joe Manchin pushed back against the popularity of President Donald Trump in his own state to win his second full term in the U.S. Senate.\n\nManchin endured the toughest campaign in his three-plus decades in West Virginia politics, defeating Republican state attorney general Patrick Morrisey on Tuesday.\n\nMorrisey was a staunch supporter of Trump, the GOP president who became popular in Appalachia for making broad promises to put coal miners back to work despite grim economic forecasts for the industry. Despite registered Democrats far outnumbering Republicans in West Virginia, the state gave Trump his largest margin of victory \u2014 42 percentage points \u2014 in 2016. He visited the state three times in recent months to rally for Morrisey.\n\nManchin worked hard to cozy up to Trump, too, while nurturing a bipartisan brand.\n\nPortraying himself as loyal to his home state rather than party ideology, Manchin was the only Senate Democrat to vote to confirm U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Morrisey said Manchin lacked leadership on the nomination, calling him \"Sideline Joe\" for waiting until the very end to announce his vote.\n\nThe 50-year-old Morrisey called himself a true conservative while his campaign accused Manchin of being \"a dishonest Washington liberal who only acts bipartisan around election day ...\"\n\nA popular former governor, Manchin won a special election in 2010 after the death of Sen. Robert C. Byrd and was elected again in 2012. Both were landslide victories.\n\nMorrisey, the two-term attorney general, went on the offensive from the start of the fall campaign after defeating U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins and convicted former coal executive Don Blankenship in May. Immediately after his primary win, Morrisey said Manchin \"has failed our state.\"\n\nManchin hammered away at Morrisey for efforts to eliminate health insurance protections for people with pre-existing conditions. While Morrisey was among those involved in a federal lawsuit in Texas, he said he had no intention of eliminating those protections.\n\nManchin had questioned Morrisey's past ties in Washington, D.C., as a lobbyist for the pharmaceutical industry \u2014 West Virginia leads the nation in the rate of drug overdose deaths. He also criticized Morrisey's roots in New Jersey, where he lost a 2000 congressional race.\n\nThe 71-year-old Manchin earned the backing of teacher unions after he supported them during a statewide strike earlier this year. He chided Morrisey for calling the strike \"unlawful\" and for saying his office was prepared to support authorities with legal remedies.\n\nManchin far outraised Morrisey in campaign contributions during the campaign. Both candidates saturated the airwaves with political ads in recent months.\n\nMorrisey was hoping to give West Virginia two Republican U.S. senators for the first time since 1958, when John D. Hoblitzell, Jr. was appointed to serve a year after the death of Democrat Matthew M. Neely, and two elected GOP senators for the first time since 1929.

(AP Photo/Jason E. Miczek) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 A fourth-quarter surge helped Charlotte complete a successful homestand. Still, coach James Borrego and All-Star guard Kemba Walker know the Hornets need to play better if they want to improve on their 6-5 start.\n\nWalker had 29 points and seven assists as Charlotte beat the Atlanta Hawks 113-102 on Tuesday night. Marvin Williams added 20 points for the Hornets, who finished a 3-1 homestand.\n\n\"I give Atlanta a lot of credit,\" Borrego said. \"They really guarded us tonight. They're very active with their shifts. We were real stagnant and we didn't have a great rhythm offensively until the fourth quarter.\"\n\nThat's when Walker and Williams spurred a 19-4 spurt that allowed the Hornets to pull away from the Hawks (3-7).\n\n\"A win is a win,\" Walker said. \"We were a little sloppy early on. But we adjusted and made plays down the stretch and came out with a win.\"\n\nWalker was critical of his five turnovers on a night when Charlotte committed 21 overall.\n\n\"They're pretty good defensively,\" Walker said. \"They're active and they disrupted us early. We have to do a better job of adjusting, especially me.\"\n\nWalker and Williams scored 12 points apiece in the second half as Charlotte erased a 54-51 halftime deficit. Walker has scored 25 or more seven times in 11 games.\n\nJeremy Lamb and Malik Monk each had 13 points for the Hornets. Nic Batum scored 10.\n\nPlaying against his former team, Jeremy Lin had 19 points off the bench to pace the Hawks, who led by seven late in the first half.\n\nAtlanta started 2018 first-round draft picks Trae Young, Kevin Huerter and Omari Spellman for the first time and pushed Charlotte before losing for the eighth time in the last nine meetings.\n\nYoung finished with 18 points and 10 assists. Kent Bazemore added 16 points.\n\nEven after falling behind 81-77 entering the fourth quarter, the Hawks forged an 84-83 advantage with 10:04 to play before the Hornets took over down the stretch. Charlotte eventually led by as many as 15.\n\n\"Coming out of halftime, we just couldn't buy a basket,\" Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said. \"We had a couple of opportunities where I thought we could have got a bigger lead and extended. We had that opportunity. We just never created any separation. I thought that was the difference in the game.\"\n\nNeither team led by more than seven until the fourth quarter.\n\nEven though he scored 18 points, Young was disappointed with his shooting.\n\n\"I can't go 0 for 7 from the 3-point line and expect to call that playing well,\" said Young, the No. 5 pick in the draft out of Oklahoma. \"My teammates did a great job of playing hard and making plays. But we just couldn't hit enough shots in the second half.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nHawks: Pierce considers Walker one of the NBA's top players. \"I'm a huge fan of Kemba. I've known Kemba for a long time.

(AP Photo/AJ Mast) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Kansas' Quentin Grimes and Dedric Lawson made quite an impression Tuesday night.\n\nThey produced basket after basket, big play after big play. If they keep playing this way, No. 1 Kansas might just stay on top of the college basketball world.\n\nGrimes scored 21 points in his college debut and Lawson added 20 points in his first game with the Jayhawks, helping Kansas stymie No. 10 Michigan State's late charge for a 92-87 victory in the season-opening Champions Classic.\n\n\"He (Grimes) came out with a free mind and played his game,\" Lawson said. \"He was the best player on our team tonight.\"\n\nGrimes certainly played well.\n\nLawson made a case, too, finishing with 14 rebounds and six assists after sitting out last season following his transfer from Memphis.\n\nTogether, the tag-team tandem stole the show at one of college basketball's premier events.

Michigan won 42-7. (AP Photo/Tony Ding) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMichigan moved into the fourth spot of the College Football Playoff rankings Tuesday night, behind Alabama, Clemson and Notre Dame.\n\nGeorgia was next at five, followed by Oklahoma.\n\nThe playoff picture cleared up after a weekend where several contenders asserted themselves. The top-four teams in the final rankings Dec. 2 will play in the national semifinals.\n\nThe Crimson Tide easily dispatched LSU from the top four, beating the Tigers 29-0. LSU, though, only dropped to No. 7 after its second loss, ahead of Washington State, West Virginia and Ohio State \u2014 all with only one loss.\n\nSelection committee chairman Rob Mullens noted LSU's three victories against teams the committee has ranked this week (Mississippi State, Auburn and Georgia).\n\n\"Their defense is extremely strong,\" said Mullens, the Oregon athletic director. \"Their two losses come against No. 1 Alabama, on the road to Florida.\"\n\nUnbeaten Notre Dame moved up one spot to No. 3, and Michigan jumped a spot after a 42-7 victory against Penn State.\n\nWith four weeks left in the season, nine of the top 10 teams are serious contenders. LSU is basically out, because the Tigers have no chance to win a conference title.\n\nAssuming the top three unbeaten teams would get in by winning out, here are the paths to the playoff.\n\nNo. 1 Alabama (9-0)\n\nThe Tide is already locked into the SEC championship game and has built up enough equity that even a regular-season loss to Mississippi State or Auburn won't keep Tua Tagovailoa and Co. out of the playoff. Now if they lost twice ... yeah, that's probably not happening. The only intrigue involving Alabama is whether the Tide could lose the SEC championship game, finish 12-1 and still get in? The chances are probably decent.\n\nNo. 2 Clemson (9-0)\n\nLike Alabama, the Tigers have some room for a regular-season misstep, but their position is not a strong as the Tide's. With a loss to ACC Atlantic rival Boston College on Saturday, Clemson would be at risk of being shut out of the conference title game. Ohio State and Alabama both made the playoff at 11-1, without even playing for a league title the last two seasons. The Tigers could, too, but it is no slam dunk.\n\nNo. 3 Notre Dame (9-0)\n\nThe Irish finish with three winnable games, but no locks. Notre Dame fans believe their team holds a trump card against Michigan, with that season-opening victory in South Bend. That could buffer the Irish against one loss in their final three games, but with no conference title and some struggling marquee teams on their schedule such as Virginia Tech and Stanford, Notre Dame is not a lock if it gets into a resume contest with other one-loss teams. Even one it beat.\n\nNo. 4 Michigan (8-1)\n\nThe Wolverines have to feel good about controlling their path to the playoff. Winning out, including at Ohio State, puts Jim Harbaugh's team at 12-1 with a Big Ten title. That's a resume with victories against Michigan State, Wisconsin and Penn State, and a seven-point road loss to Notre Dame. One loss and Michigan is out, right? Not so fast. Take a quick glance at the rankings and notice how many highly ranked teams still have to play each other. It won't take more than one or two mild upsets to have the selection committee sifting through a bunch of two-loss teams to fill the final playoff spot. Figure the ones with conference championships will have the edge.\n\nNo. 5 Georgia (8-1)\n\nSimple: Win out, get in. Oh, and beat Alabama. The good news for the Bulldogs is beating Alabama to win the SEC championship would almost certainly make up for a second regular-season loss. Georgia has got a little leeway when it faces Auburn and Georgia Tech.\n\nNo. 6 Oklahoma (8-1)\n\nUCLA did the Sooners no favor by being terrible and depriving Oklahoma of a quality nonconference victory. Still, the Sooners are probably the Big 12's best bet to win an argument against a one-loss Big Ten champion or Notre Dame with one loss. Maybe.\n\nNo. 8 Washington State (8-1)\n\nThe Cougars could finish as 12-1 champions of the weakest Power Five conference and no notable nonconference victories. The most realistic scenario to put Mike Leach's Washington State team in the playoff involves Big Ten and Big 12 implosions.\n\nNo. 9 West Virginia (7-1)\n\nThe weather did the Mountaineers no favor by forcing the cancellation of West Virginia's game at North Carolina State in September. The Mountaineers do have a victory against Tennessee on a neutral field. Not terrible. To get to 11-1 and a Big 12 title could mean two victories over Oklahoma in consecutive weekends.\n\nNo. 10 Ohio State (8-1)\n\nThe Buckeyes found out last season that getting hammered by a team that finished the regular season 7-5 is deal-breaker with the committee when it comes time to make a tough choice. Ohio State could win out \u2014 beating Michigan State and Michigan along the way \u2014 and get in. But that's a long way from certain considering the Buckeyes are the lowest ranked one-loss team.\n\nNo. 12 UCF (8-0)\n\nThe Knights stayed at No. 12 after beating Temple 52-40 last week.\n\n\"Strong offense, struggling on defense,\" Mullens said.\n\nAthletic director Danny White and the Knights fans certainly don't want to hear this, but another perfect season probably won't even get UCF seriously considered for a spot in the semifinal \u2014 unless things get really weird.\n\nSo let's think weird: Northwestern wins the Big Ten, Arizona State wins the Pac-12, Iowa State wins the Big 12, Pitt wins the ACC, Notre Dame losses two of its final three and Georgia losses to both Auburn and Alabama. That's extreme, but if three of those six things happen, UCF probably gets a look.\n\n____\n\nFollow Ralph D.

Currently, former felons must wait at least 5 years after completing their sentences to ask the Florida Clemency Board, made up by the governor and the Cabinet, to restore their rights.\n\nA U.S. district judge found Florida's current system arbitrary and unconstitutional in March, and the case is under appeal.

In his team's season opener Tuesday night, the early returns were encouraging.\n\nFreshmen Nate Laszewski, Robby Carmody and Dane Goodwin were among five Fighting Irish players to score in double figures as youthful Notre Dame cruised by Illinois-Chicago 84-67.\n\n\"My attitude is we're going to play 10 guys in the first half, and then they'll tell us who's going to play in the second half,\" Brey said after improving to 19-0 in openers during his Irish tenure.\n\nThe 6-foot-10 Laszewski led the way with 12 points and a game-high nine rebounds in 19 minutes off the bench.\n\nCarmody \u2014 who became the first freshman to start an opener for Notre Dame since Torin Francis in 2002 \u2014 added 11 points in 14 minutes.

(Matt Freed/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Xavier Johnson and Trey McGowens committed to Pittsburgh within a week of each other last spring, won over by new head coach Jeff Capel's enthusiasm and hardly bothered by the prospect of trying to earn their way into the starting lineup.\n\nThey spend copious amounts of time in the gym, determined to be part of the turnaround the Panthers have tasked Capel with orchestrating following the program's freefall under former head coach Kevin Stallings.\n\nWhile the polish isn't quite there, the effort certainly is. McGowens scored 17 points, Johnson added 16 points, six assists and five rebounds as Pitt pulled away in the second half for a 69-53 victory over Youngstown State on Tuesday night.\n\n\"We're young,\" McGowens said. \"So the biggest thing we're going to learn from our mistakes, that's the biggest thing. (Capel) talks a lot about playing with energy. We're going to make mistakes but obviously we're going to learn from them.\"\n\nDuring one 10-second sequence in the first half Johnson blew a dunk, raced back on defense, grabbed a rebound and rather than flip the ball ahead to Kene Chukwuka for an easy layup took it up the floor himself. His attempt to wrap the ball behind his back ended up with the ball sailing out of bounds due to a turnover, and yet he remained in the game.\n\n\"I think if you're going to allow guys to have freedom then you have to allow them to make mistakes as long as they're mistakes going hard,\" Capel said. \"We certainly made some mistakes and it wasn't just those guys, it was everyone, it was me. But those guys were playing hard. You allow them to grow. You allow them to fix it.\"\n\nTaking over a program that went 0-19 in the ACC last year, Capel cautioned it will take time for the Panthers to climb their way back into relevance in arguably the nation's toughest conference. He stressed there are no shortcuts and his starting lineup may have indicated his commitment to a long-term rebuild, though the first step ended with Pitt picking up its first victory in 319 days.\n\nThe Panthers sent three freshmen \u2014 Johnson, McGowens and Au'Diese Toney onto the floor \u2014 and Capel substituted liberally trying to get a feel for what he has on his hands.\n\nMalik Ellison, a transfer from St. John's, scored 13 for Pitt as the Panthers used a 12-0 run early in the second half to take control after the Penguins briefly tied the game at 27. Chukwuka provided a jolt off the bench, finishing with seven points and eight rebounds.\n\n\"He gave us energy,\" Capel said. \"That's who Kene has been since I've been here. I thought his energy on both ends of the court helped us break the game open.\"\n\nKendale Hampton had 15 points off the bench for Youngstown State but the Penguins shot just 27 percent (18 of 67) from the field, including 8 of 38 3-pointers.\n\nYoungstown State actually had more turnovers (20) than made baskets. Pitt wasn't much better for long stretches but was never threatened after a Johnson-fueled burst put the Panthers up double digits.\n\n\"We had been averaging close to 35 or 40 (3-point attempts in scrimmages),\" Penguins coach Jerrod Calhoun said. \"If you make seven or eight more or even five more, it's a different ballgame.\"\n\nWILSON-FRAME OUT\n\nThe Panthers played without senior forward Jared Wilson-Frame, suspended one game for a violation of team rules.\n\nThe absence of Wilson-Frame, the leading scorer last season on a team that went winless in the Atlantic Coast Conference, gave Capel a chance to experiment extensively with his lineup. Toney had 12 points and nine rebounds while starting in place of Wilson-Frame, though Capel said Wilson-Frame will be back with the team on Friday against VMI.\n\nEARLY AND UGLY\n\nThe college season started a week earlier than usual, and the rustiness showed. It wasn't just the turnovers. Capel counted at least a handful of layups the Panthers missed and flow was hard to come by.\n\n\"It was like going to the dentist,\" Calhoun said. \"It was painful to watch.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nYoungstown State: The Penguins are in the midst of a rebuild of their own under Calhoun. Youngstown State has just four players back from a team that was 8-24 last season. Calhoun is committed to having his team chuck it from deep, though a couple more 8 for 38 performances might force him to reconsider.\n\nPitt: Capel's arrival brings energy and the schedule over the opening weeks isn't exactly daunting. The Panthers don't play a Power 5 team until facing Iowa in three weeks as part of the Big Ten/ACC Challenge. By then Capel may have some semblance of a rotation.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYoungstown State: Faces Akron in Cleveland on Saturday as part of the Northeast Ohio Coaches vs. Cancer Classic.\n\nPitt: Welcomes Virginia Military Institute on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Wade Payne) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Tennessee coach Rick Barnes used to walk down the railroad tracks with his brother and sneak into the gym to watch Lenoir-Rhyne basketball games when he was a kid.\n\nBarnes returned the favor on Tuesday night by welcoming the Bears to his new home at Thompson-Boling Arena, but he didn't show his alma mater any mercy on the scoreboard.\n\nJordan Bone scored 18 points and Kyle Alexander added 16 as No. 6 Tennessee opened the season with an 86-41 victory over Lenoir-Rhyne.\n\nBarnes lettered for three seasons at Lenoir-Rhyne. Barnes is a native of Hickory, North Carolina, where Lenoir-Rhyne is located. He still closely follows all Lenoir-Rhyne sports and praised the progress head coach Everick Sullivan has made with the basketball program.\n\n\"Obviously our size and strength was able to get to them, but I do think he is working to do the right things,\" Barnes said. \"It's a good time to be an LR Bear, and I am proud of my college and my university.\"\n\nThe game against the Division II opponent counts on Tennessee's overall record, but Lenoir-Rhyne counted the game as an exhibition.\n\nIn front of a crowd of 16,156, the Volunteers opened a season of heightened expectations. The defending Southeastern Conference co-champions return all five starters, and their No. 6 ranking is their highest ever in the preseason poll.\n\nGrant Williams and Admiral Schofield filled up the stat sheet for the Vols. Williams had 13 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Schofield had 13 points, nine rebounds and four assists.\n\nLenoir-Rhyne's 3-point shooting kept things close early in the first meeting between the programs. The Bears started out 6 of 10 from beyond the arc, forcing Barnes to call a timeout when R.J. Gunn and Jalen Johnson hit back-to-back 3-pointers to draw within 20-18.\n\nBolstered by a flurry of steals, the Vols emerged from the break on an 8-0 run. Alexander punctuated the spurt with dunk on the break off an alley-oop pass from Jordan Bowden. The Vols led 50-30 at halftime.\n\n\"Both Bone and Grant with their full-court defense kept getting stops at the front,\" said Alexander, who finished with four blocked shots. \"I remember coming in and not having to play any defense on the first three possessions because Bone and Grant were just doing a great job at the front, so that was really the turning point for us.\"\n\nTennessee didn't let up to start the second half, opening with a 19-0 run that spanned nearly nine minutes. Lenoir-Rhyne burned two timeouts within the first six minutes to try and stem the tide, but Tennessee kept coming in waves.\n\nThroughout the game, the Vols demonstrated its athleticism with high-flying dunks and blocks. Yves Pons, a sophomore from France, brought the fans to their feet midway through the second half with an emphatic swat on one end followed by a putback on the other.\n\nAfter its early 3-point prowess, Lenoir-Rhyne made only one of its last 25 attempts from beyond the arc. The Bears shot only 20.9 percent (14 of 67) from the field overall and didn't have a player reach double figures in points. Manny Wembi led the Bears with nine.\n\n\"It was like a war of attrition when you are dealing with that size and that athleticism. There is no way our guys can maintain that physicality they are throwing at your unless you are making 3s,\" Sullivan said. \"That was our game plan, to see if we could make 3s and stay within striking distance. They followed the game plan. They just didn't make enough shots.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nLenoir-Rhyne: The trip to Knoxville was a no-lose situation for the Bears. They got to play a Division I opponent in a major venue and weren't expected to win. Lenoir-Rhyne gave its players a great experience that won't impact its overall record. The Bears won't see a better team all season. \"They understand the ramifications,\" Sullivan said of his players. \"There are none.\"\n\nTennessee: The Vols are easing into the season with their first two games against Lenoir-Rhyne and Louisiana-Lafayette before a challenging stretch begins with games against Georgia Tech, Louisville and either No. 1 Kansas or Marquette.\n\nINJURY UPDATE\n\nTennessee was shorthanded in the backourt with guards Lamonte' Turner and Jalen Johnson sitting out with injuries. Barnes said he expects both to play Friday against Louisiana-Lafayette.\n\nKEY STATS\n\nThe Vols outscored the Bears 46-12 in the paint, scored 22 points off turnovers and assisted on 23 of their 34 made baskets.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLenoir-Rhyne hosts Young Harris on Friday.\n\nTennessee hosts Louisiana-Lafayette on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It starts with Chloe Jackson,\" said Mulkey, the former national championship point guard at Louisiana Tech. \"I can't tell you how impressed I am with her. Point guard is the most difficult position on the floor. For her to come here and just grasp everything I'm throwing at her every day and to lead our basketball team, it's really remarkable.\"\n\nJackson, a transfer from LSU, had 10 points and five assists without a turnover in 26 minutes.\n\nWith the graduation of Kristy Wallace and the offseason dismissal of Alexis Morris for an unspecified violation of team rules, the Lady Bears went into preseason practice uncertain of who would be the point guard.\n\nBrown finished with 13 points, matching Moon Ursin for the team high. Brown also had four rebounds while playing only 18 minutes for Baylor, which has won two national titles and the last eight Big 12 regular season titles. All 11 players who saw action scored multiple points and had at least one rebound.\n\nCassidy Barrios had 20 points and nine rebounds for Nicholls State.

It was an emphasis,\" Brown said. They held Nicholls to 23 percent shooting (12 of 53) from the field, and had a 48-25 rebounding edge.\n\nLOUISIANA REUNION\n\nThere was a lengthy wait for Mulkey to get to the interview room postgame. \"We've got a lot of Louisiana folks in the house,\" she said.

(AP) \u2014 Hoosiers fans got to their seats inside Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall a little bit earlier than usual on Tuesday night, the student section nearly full almost an hour before tip-off.\n\nThe state of Indiana's reigning Mr. Basketball Award winner was about to jog out of the Indiana University locker room in the school's famed candy-stripe warmup pants.\n\nThis was a moment more than two years in the making.\n\n\"Emotions were high,\" Langford said with a grin. \"(I) Couldn't wait.\"\n\nLangford got the starting nod from Indiana coach Archie Miller in his collegiate debut and scored a team-high 19 points to lead the Hoosiers to a 104-55 win over Chicago State.\n\nThe highly coveted McDonald's All-American from New Albany, Indiana scored the his first career point for Indiana from the foul line to extend the Hoosiers' lead in a game where they trailed just once, for a total of 13 seconds. Langford struggled to make his first shot from the floor during the first 10 minutes of the game.\n\nLangford finally made his first field goal with about nine minutes left in the first half and would go on to score the next eight points for Indiana during a four-minute span in which he scored 11 straight points for the Hoosiers.\n\n\"I guess that jumper (got me going),\" Langford said. \"To see the ball go through the net, that's all I really need. I just need to see that first shot go down and it's all good for me from there.\"\n\nPerhaps the nerves and anticipation stirring inside Assembly Hall on Tuesday night came with an added level of pressure. But it's unlikely, considering Langford has lived with and exceeded such pressure and expectations during his high school career. The former five-star recruit was excited to finally get out on the floor in a real game and play with his teammates and fellow freshmen, Langford said.\n\nOnce Langford got into his groove, Indiana's lead quickly jumped to double-digits and stayed there. Indiana put together a 17-3 run to close out the end of the first half. Langford scored 17 points in the first half and finished the game shooting 7 of 12 from the floor and 5 of 11 from the foul line and added three assists and four rebounds to his debut stat line. Devonte Green scored 15 points, Evan Fitzner finished with 14 points and Justin Smith added 13 for Indiana.\n\n\"Romeo was the beneficiary of some very good advance passes . I thought, just in general (especially) in the first half, (Langford) was very efficient,\" Hoosiers coach Archie Miller said. \"We have one in the books. It's always good to get the first one out of the way with a win.\"\n\nThe Hoosiers led by as many as 49 points on Tuesday night. Indiana benefited from a variety of Cougars' mistakes and shortcomings. The Hoosiers scored 25 points off of 20 Chicago State turnovers and outscored the Cougars 54-24 in the paint. Indiana's bench scored 51 points, just four points fewer than Chicago State's total.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nLangford and the Hoosiers will have one more contest against a mid-major opponent where they'll be favorites to win in impressive fashion before they face their first power five programs when the Marquette Golden Eagles come to Bloomington on Nov. 14 and when Indiana travels to Arkansas on Nov. 18.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIndiana: will host Montana State on Friday.\n\nChicago State: will visit Notre Dame on Thursday.\n\n__________________\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Ty Jerome said it was great to be back on the basketball court.\n\nJerome scored 20 points and De'Andre Hunter had 13 and 10 rebounds as No. 5 Virginia beat Towson 73-42 on Tuesday night in its first game since they made history that followed them all offseason as the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16 seed in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe Cavaliers didn't just lose, but got dominated in a 74-54 loss to UMBC.\n\n\"Given how last year ended, I think we were even more excited to come out and get a win under our belts and just play basketball with each other again,\" he said, adding that he's been asked to address similar questions a lot. \"We were real anxious. We've been playing against each other for a while now, the whole summer and then a month of practices. We were excited to play against somebody else.\"\n\nJerome made six 3-pointers for the Cavaliers (1-0), who outscored the Tigers 45-23 after halftime. He scored 11 in the first half and took a seat early having made 6 of 9 3-point shots and adding four assists. He was joined with an early night off by Hunter, who played just 26 minutes in his return from a wrist injury that caused him to miss the ACC championship and the infamous loss in the tournament.\n\nCoach Tony Bennett emptied his bench by the midpoint of the second half.\n\n\"That was a great joy for me to see that,\" he said of giving Kody Stattmann, Jayden Nixon and Grant Kersey their first college minutes.\n\nTobias Howard made three 3-pointers and led Towson (0-1) with 10 points and Brian Fobbs had nine. The Tigers had long spells without a field goal in each half and finished shooting 31.7 percent (13-41). They also missed 15 of 27 free throws (46.7 percent) and turned the ball over 14 times while forcing just five by the Cavaliers.\n\n\"We appreciate Ty Jerome throwing a bunch of dagger threes in there to really give them some separation,\" coach Pat Skeery said. \"He just has that kind of innate feel about when to seize the game. That's kind of what he did to cause some separation and wear us down.\"\n\nFreshman Kihel Clark was impressive in his debut for Virginia. The 5-foot-9 guard made, arguably, the defensive play of the game when he intercepted the ball while guarding an inbounds pass and laid it in for a 49-33 Cavaliers lead. Later, he threw an alley-oop pass to Jay Huff, putting Virginia ahead 65-37 with 3:29 to play. Alabama transfer Braxton Key had seven points and nine rebounds for Virginia.\n\nTHE HAUNTING\n\nBennett was wrapping up his postgame media session when he glanced up at a TV in the room.\n\nIt was showing a game between UMBC and Marquette.\n\n\"I'd like to thank Bach for putting the UMBC game on for me in my postgame press conference,\" he said, laughing, of Virginia men's basketball sports information director, Erich Bacher. \"That's really great of our sports information director. That's really wonderful.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nTowson: The Tigers have a tall task, especially early in the season with only three players back from last season's team and the leading scorer among the three, Jordan McNeil (4.7 ppg), sidelined with a wrist injury suffered two weeks ago. Coach Pat Skeery has nine new players to incorporate into his style of play.\n\nVirginia: The Cavaliers were very slow starting on offense, but the defense that has been their trademark under Tony Bennett was there from the outset. Towson went nearly nine minutes between field goals in the first half and more than 10 minutes without a field goal on the second half and in Kyle Guy, Jerome, Hunter and Key, they have four players who figure to be very reliable scorers.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Tigers go to the other end of the spectrum, returning home to face Division III Wesley on Sunday.\n\nThe Cavaliers stay home and face George Washington of the Atlantic 10 on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nFollow Hank on Twitter: www.twitter.com/hankkurzjr\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A Twitter user, Jordan Rudner, detailed it in a series of posts.\n\nBill Walker, the nation's only independent governor who has led Alaska since 2014, bowed out of his race seemingly at the last minute. Walker explained he didn't think he would win a three-way race after Democrat Mark Begich jumped into the race, possibly dividing the Democratic vote to the benefit of Republican candidate Mike Dunleavy.\n\nRemember the name Mark Begich. It will come up later.\n\nOkay. As promised, a short thread breaking down the absolutely bonkers elections happening in Alaska today, including a race that could unseat the current longest-serving member of Congress. Let's journey to the frozen north together. \u2014 Jordan Rudner (@jrud) November 6, 2018\n\nIn Congress, Don Young has held the state's at-large seat in the House since 1973. To put that in perspective, Alaska became a U.S. state in 1959. Young is known for wild antics, including, as Rudner mentioned on Twitter, once holding a 10-inch bone knife to former House Speaker John Boehner's throat.\n\nYoung's start in Congress was anything but typical: He originally lost the 1972 election to incumbent Democrat Nick Begich, who disappeared on a plane from Anchorage to Juneau before voters cast ballots. Those on board the flight that October included Rep. Hale Boggs, D-La.; Begich's aide, Russell Brown; and the pilot, Don Jonz.\n\nMore: Midterm elections 2018: Candidates in tough races duck and dodge party label\n\nThe pilot stopped communicating mid-flight. A massive search unfolded, but both the plane and those on board were never found.\n\nBegich still won the race weeks later. It wasn't until January that the House officially recognized Begich was presumed dead, allowing for a special election in 1973.\n\nThe winner? Don Young. He's held that seat ever since. And remember gubernatorial candidate Mark Begich? His father was Nick Begich, who originally beat Young before disappearing on the flight.\n\nAnother interesting tidbit: A 2010 report by the Washington Post notes that, before his death in the plane crash, Nick Begich was almost in another crash in 1970.\n\nHis plane made an emergency landing on a sandbar, and rescuers found him and the rest of those on board uninjured.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/elections-alaskas-race-governor-house-linked-bizarre-1970-s-plane-crash/1909343002/", "DURHAM, N.H.

Still, the Los Angeles Dodgers president of baseball operations was willing to acquire the four-time All-Star infielder because his good points outweighed the bad.\n\n\"He got booed in Baltimore three weeks before we traded for him,\" Friedman said Tuesday at the general managers' meetings. \"It's not like it was a secret. I think it's never a fun thing to watch, at least from my perspective and vantage point, but I do think it's important to dig further into that, and I think there are times when guys do that and they don't really care. And I think there are other times where guys do it and they really do care, and by care I mean the effort they put into their work, the type of teammate they are, and Manny checks all those boxes.\"\n\nMachado is among the top two free agents on the market along with outfielder Bryce Harper after a 3\u00bd -month stay with the Dodgers. The 26-year-old was acquired from the Orioles in mid-July and took over the shortstop job that opened when Corey Seager tore an elbow ligament in late April that required season-ending surgery.\n\nMachado hit .273 with 13 homers and 42 RBIs in 66 games, and the Dodgers won their second straight NL pennant. He hit .227 with three homers and 12 RBIs in 16 postseason games, including .182 (4 for 22) with three RBIs in the five-game World Series loss to Boston.\n\nHe kicked Milwaukee first baseman Jesus Aguilar near the ankle as he jogged out a groundout during the NL Championship Series, leading to a $10,000 fine, and was criticized for a pair of hard slides into Brewers shortstop Orlando Arcia, prompting Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich to call Machado \"a dirty player.\"\n\nMachado stood at home plate watching a fly ball in Game 3 that bounced off a wall and became a 368-foot single, spiked Boston first baseman Steve Pearce in Game 4 and fell to a knee striking out against Chris Sale in Game 5, ending the Dodgers' second straight World Series loss.\n\n\"So would I rather see more effort as I'm watching? Of course. I think anyone would say that,\" Friedman said. \"But I think that in and of itself isn't as critical of a dynamic as it would be if he didn't care, if he didn't put in the work, didn't put in the effort, and that in our 3 1/2 months of being around him was really strong.\"\n\nFriedman would not say how he would fill the void if Farhan Zaidi, the Dodgers general manager and No. 2 baseball operations official for the past four years, left for San Francisco.\n\n\"We'll talk about that if it happens,\" Friedman said.\n\nHours later, the Giants announced Zaidi as their new president of baseball operations.\n\nFriedman said he is confident the Dodgers will reach a new agreement with Dave Roberts, their manager for the past three seasons.\n\n\"The conversations have been pleasant and they have been ongoing,\" Friedman said.\n\n___\n\nAP freelance writer Jay Paris contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

By the end of Saturday's 55-31 loss , the Gophers had allowed 646 yards of offense, including 430 rushing yards, and five touchdowns that covered at least 30 yards. By the end of Sunday, Fleck had fired defensive coordinator Robb Smith.\n\n\"There's a lot of different things, whether it's schematics, whether it's the coaching part, whether it's the personnel part,\" Fleck said Tuesday. \"It's a combination of all of that. As you continue to move forward, you either see that you want this to continue to happen and you believe in that, or you make that change.\"\n\nDefensive line coach Joe Rossi was elevated to interim defensive coordinator, with Minnesota (4-5, 1-5 Big Ten) preparing to host Purdue (5-4, 4-2) this week. Rossi assumed command of a defense allowing an average of 43.2 points per game in conference play, along with 507.7 yards per game.\n\nThe breakdowns against Illinois were just a continuation of a troubling trend. Star safety Antoine Winfield Jr. injured his foot in the Big Ten opener at Maryland, when the Terrapins rushed for 315 yards amid a slew of missed tackles by the Gophers.\n\nOhio State passed for 412 yards against Minnesota. Nebraska and Illinois each scored at least 53 points and tallied at least 646 yards of offense. The Gophers also own the conference's worst turnover margin at minus-8.\n\n\"There was a big difference between the beginning of the year, end of the year, for a lot of different reasons,\" Fleck said. \"It was a very inconsistent, rollercoaster-type ride. Again, there's a lot of blame to go around, a lot of areas. Again, that starts with me.\"\n\nThe 39-year-old Rossi was the defensive coordinator at Rutgers for two seasons before being hired by Fleck in 2017 to be Minnesota's quality control coach. He took over as the defensive line coach this year.\n\n\"It's the explosive plays and the turnovers,\" Fleck said. \"We have to get way more takeaways and we have to eliminate the explosive plays. I think that's what I want it to look like as we keep going forward and keep getting better. That's what we've talked about since day one we've gotten here. That's how you win ballgames.\"\n\nUp next is a Purdue squad that owns the Big Ten's second-best scoring offense at 35.8 points per game in conference games. The Boilermakers are second in the league in total offense, averaging 485.2 yards per game. They've beaten then-No. 2 Ohio State and then-No. 19 Iowa in two of their past three games, with a loss at Michigan State in between.\n\nFleck's message to Rossi was to get the Gophers to play fast.\n\n\"I want them having confidence when they step on the field Saturday, playing fast, knowing exactly where they need to be,\" Fleck said. \"I know that's our conversation.

He had surgery on his right knee after the 2010 season, in July 2014, after the 2016 season and again last month. Sabathia pitches with a brace on the knee and needs periodic injections there during the season.\n\nHe is 246-153 in 18 major league seasons with a 3.70 ERA and 2,986 strikeouts, including 129-80 in a decade with the Yankees. His new deal boosts his pay from New York to $229 million.\n\nSabathia signed a $161 million, seven-year contract with the Yankees before the 2009 season and led New York to its first World Series title since 2000, then used the leverage of an opt-out provision after the 2011 season to get a new deal that added a $25 million salary for 2016 with a $25 million team option for 2017.\n\nSabathia took a cut to $10 million this year. He missed a $500,000 performance bonus by two innings when he was ejected in his last regular-season start for hitting Tampa Bay's Jesus Sucre after Rays pitcher Andrew Kittredge threw up-and-in to Austin Romine. Sabathia was suspended the first five games of 2019 but has appealed.\n\n\"At this stage of the game, we should know sooner or later whether we'll be able to agree on something or not,\" Yankees general manager Brian Cashman had said earlier Tuesday.\n\n\"Last year we had to be really careful about every step we took in terms of financial commitments so it took longer because we were having to have that luxury-tax issue in the back of our minds.\"\n\nNew York dropped below the luxury-tax threshold for the first time in 2018. The Yankees' projected rotation for 2019 also includes right-handers Luis Severino and Masahiro Tanaka, and Cashman says he intends to add several pitchers after the team went 100-62 only to finish second in the AL East and lose in the Division Series to Boston, the eventual World Series champion.\n\nCashman said Luke Voit will head to spring training as the starter at first base, and it will be up to Greg Bird to earn the job back. Bird had ankle surgery in late March, returned in mid-May and hit .199 with 11 homers and 38 RBIs. Voit, acquired from St. Louis on July 28, hit .333 with 14 homers and 33 RBIs in 39 games.\n\n\"He finished batting in the middle of our lineup in the postseason, so I don't see why three weeks since that time would change our evaluation process,\" Cashman said.\n\n\"Somebody's earned that right and somebody because of injuries has been derailed for a period of time, but I do think that Birdy will benefit from time off and he will have a chance to resuscitate and prove himself.\"\n\nBoth can be optioned to the minors next year.\n\nCashman repeated he intends to trade pitcher Sonny Gray, just 15-16 since New York acquired him from Oakland in July 2017. A right-hander who turns 29 this week, Gray bristled at the rough reception by Yankees fans.\n\n\"It's been a year-and-a-half, I'm not going to be Sisyphus pushing the rock up a hill and having it roll back on top of me,\" Cashman said. \"It's not working. I'm not going to be willing to continue to walk through the fire and expect it to be a different result. So I will reallocate his abilities to some other club for a yet-to-be determined price tag, and he will be good again. Trust me. I think he's a heck of a pitcher. He's a very successful major leaguer, and it's just going to happen somewhere else.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Alex\n\nLatino voter enthusiasm is showing in early voting numbers, proving that doomsday predictions of Latino voter apathy were flat wrong. Latino voters are energized and mobilized. Their voter turnout during early voting exceeded 2014 midterm levels. That was before Election Day. Tuesday, Latinos will show their electoral power in full force.\n\nLatino voter turnout has always had a critical impact in our elections, especially for Democrats. This year, it's no different. Of the 73 congressional races that have been deemed most competitive, 25 are in districts where Latinos make up at least 10 percent of eligible voters, as noted in The Washington Post.\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center, in 12 of those districts, Latinos make up at least 20 percent of eligible voters. Democrats need these Latino voters to win back the House, and from what we can already see, Latino voters are showing up to the polls.\n\nLatino voters will also play a significant role in the Senate and governor's races in Florida and Nevada; the governor's races in Georgia, Colorado, Connecticut and New Mexico; and the Senate races in New Jersey, Arizona and Texas. One key factor why Latino voters will shatter expectations and prove wrong the countless headlines bemoaning Latino participation is evident: a slate of progressive, diverse candidates running up and down the ballot.\n\nTalker: Election Day is going to be a crazy day in cable news.

There is a renewed awareness that democracy works only if we participate in it. The Trump administration is poised to continue implementing draconian anti-immigrant laws, taking away our health care, cutting taxes for the rich at the expense of the middle class, and attacking women, communities of color and the LGBTQ community. Latinos, like millions of Americans, feel the urgency to use the power of their vote.\n\nThis election will prove that the Latino electorate is an active and significant political force now and in future elections.\n\nCrist\u00f3bal J.

Online voting isn\u2019t a silver bullet. It wouldn\u2019t thwart political disinformation campaigns that rely on false tweets or bogus Facebook pages, and it wouldn\u2019t be a solution to the problems presented by gerrymandering. However, done properly, online voting could boost voter participation, avoid administrative errors at polling stations, and help restore the public\u2019s trust in the electoral process and democracy.\"\n\nHelen Alvar\u00e9, CNN.com: \"Women suffer more poverty than men and need state action prioritizing the poor. Women practice religion more than men, being more likely to pray daily, attend services weekly, and report that God is very important in their lives. Women are more likely than men to report that they would like to have more flexible work arrangements and paid family leave to care for loved ones. I haven't given up hope that elected women will bring women's needs to the table more forcefully. I am only saying that their sex doesn't guarantee it, and that female citizens will not be absolved of their duty to agitate for what women need most.\"\n\n'Why are you voting?'\n\nComments taken from r/politics on Reddit, where USA TODAY posted the question:\n\nI'm voting because I'm tired of seeing American politics defined by hatred.

(Photo: Liz Dufour/The Enquirer)\n\nTurn Election Day into a national holiday\n\nWay back in 1845, it made perfect sense for Congress to designate Election Day on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Today, 173 years later, not so much.\n\nThe day was dictated by the needs of America\u2019s farming society, religious practice and travel time to get to faraway polling places. A national election in the early spring or summer would have interfered with planting, while late summer or early fall would have hampered harvests.\n\nNovember fell after harvest and before the harshest winter weather set in. Sunday was out because many people went to church and wouldn\u2019t have wanted to travel to polling places to vote on Sunday or Monday. Wednesday was often farmers\u2019 market day. So Congress settled on Tuesday for presidential elections and added congressional races later.\n\nIt has been been a long time since America had a largely agrarian economy. And voting on a weekday interferes with work, particularly for low-income workers with little flexibility.\n\nIn a society accustomed to fast food and fast internet speeds, citizens shouldn\u2019t have to miss work or wait hours in line to exercise a sacred constitutional right. It\u2019s long past time to make Election Day a national holiday, or move it to the weekend. At the very least, all states should join the approximately three dozen that allow early voting in person for people who have trouble with Tuesday.\n\nWhile this year\u2019s midterm elections generated an outsized turnout, in a nation where just 60 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in the 2016 presidential contest and 37 percent voted in the 2014 congressional elections, government should be striving to make voting easier for everybody, not tougher.\n\nLong lines, malfunctioning machines\n\nOf all the things government shouldn\u2019t skimp on, keeping election machinery in working condition and enough polls open so everyone can cast ballots ought to be at the top of the list. But either by egregious design or mindless planning, government keeps putting obstacles in the way of voters.\n\nIn the mindless category, counties and states have been eliminating polling places since 2012, often to save money. And voting machines, which were modernized after the 2000 Bush-Gore election debacle, have grown decrepit. More than 40 states use machines that are no longer manufactured, turning repairs into a hunt for second-hand parts that often work poorly.\n\nThis is no way to ensure that Americans get to exercise their right to vote. Effects of this lackluster effort showed up across the country Tuesday. Reports of malfunctioning voting machines \u2014 including some switching people\u2019s votes \u2014 poured in from more than a dozen states to Election Protection, a coalition of about 100 civil- and voting-rights groups doing what should be the government\u2019s job.\n\nIn Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County, where many sites were closed in 2016, some polling places couldn\u2019t even open on time. In Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas and elsewhere, machines broke down. In Georgia, lines stretched around a poll site in Atlanta, and some voters in Snellville \u2014 where nearly half the population is minority \u2014 waited for more than four hours outside one site because machines weren\u2019t working.\n\nDecrepit machines, along with fewer polling places and poll workers, leave voters confused about where to vote, having to travel longer distances, often waiting in long lines or giving up without voting.\n\nThe only thing worse? Republicans who control the voting machinery in states and purposely try to suppress voters.\n\nGeorgia was ground zero for this disgusting strategy. Secretary of State Brian Kemp, the GOP candidate for governor, employed all sorts of draconian measures that looked like they would keep minority voters from the polls. Similar strategies were at work from North Carolina to Kansas.\n\nBack in 1977, after Jimmy Carter won the bellwether state of Ohio and the presidency, a top Ohio Republican was asked how his party lost. He quipped, \u201cBecause too many people voted.\u201d\n\nSuppressing the vote has become an all-too-common strategy. It should end, along with brainless planning that deprives voters of a cherished constitutional right.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

(AP Photo/Ron Jenkins) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFRISCO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Even if the Dallas Cowboys were better than 3-5, Jerry Jones says he would have plenty of cause for concern based on what he saw in a damaging loss to Tennessee.\n\nAnd the normally upbeat owner and general manager doesn't care to discuss the NFC East standings, even though the Cowboys can pull even with defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia by getting their first road win of the season at the Eagles on Sunday.\n\n\"We're not in anything if we don't play better,\" Jones said after a 28-14 loss to the Titans that looked like it could be a blowout win for Dallas midway through the first quarter. \"What I recognize is not so much the three wins and five losses but the way we lost this game and the way we played in the game.\n\n\"We've got to play better. Our record could be better than it is right now, and we'd still be in trouble.\"\n\nThe Cowboys traded for a new No. 1 receiver in Amari Cooper and fired offensive line coach Paul Alexander during a surprisingly busy open week. The changes looked good early, with Cooper scoring the first Dallas touchdown and star running back Ezekiel Elliott having 75 yards from scrimmage in the first quarter.\n\nEverything changed with Dak Prescott's throw to Cooper in double coverage in the end zone with a 7-0 lead. Kevin Byard intercepted, Tennessee drove 80 yards in 15 plays for the tie and the Titans never trailed again.\n\nNow the Cowboys are looking at a second straight year of missing the playoffs since the remarkable rookie seasons for Prescott and Elliott, who powered Dallas to an NFC-best 13 wins before a divisional round loss to Green Bay.\n\nSince a franchise-record 11-game winning streak for an 11-1 record two years ago, the Cowboys are 14-15, including the loss to the Packers.\n\nJones was peppered with questions about Garrett's job security after the loss to the Titans, at one point flatly saying he wouldn't fire him during the season. Anything less than a 6-2 finish would leave Garrett with three winning seasons, and two playoff appearances, in eight full seasons.\n\n\"I don't know how to articulate my patience or lack thereof, and I'm not trying to be smart,\" Jones said. \"I just don't have an assessment of my patience right now.\"\n\nPrescott committed his first two turnovers at home this season in Dallas' first loss at AT&T Stadium. The interception was the game-changer. A fumble while trying to churn for yardage on a sack at his 40-yard line set up Tennessee's go-ahead touchdown in the third quarter.\n\nWhile it's realistic to expect Prescott and Cooper to need time to work together and an offensive line to adjust to an in-season coaching change, the Cowboys are running out of it.\n\n\"As coach Garrett said, we've got a decision to make,\" said Prescott, who threw for 243 yards and two touchdowns. \"We've got to buckle down, lock arms and be together more than ever. Not let anything break us apart.\"\n\nGarrett revealed a possible crack Tuesday. A few weeks after strongly backing Scott Linehan when asked if he still had faith in his offensive coordinator, Garrett had a different tone when asked if he envisioned a scenario where he took over play-calling.\n\n\"Right now, Scott Linehan is going to call the plays on offense,\" Garrett, who called plays early in his tenure as head coach, said after the Cowboys had just 109 yards total offense in a scoreless second half against the Titans.\n\nIf the Cowboys lose to the Eagles, not much else will matter, other than the question of Garrett's future beyond this season. Jones declined several chances to address that issue.\n\n\"I think we realize we have eight games to go, we've got a long way to go in this season,\" Jones said. \"We want to play better than we played tonight, so I certainly think each individual and coach and front office person is going to have to do better, including me.\"\n\nNOTES: Garrett said rookie LG Connor Williams came out of the Titans game with a knee injury that could require arthroscopic surgery. Any possible line shuffling would appear to be confined to Williams' spot and center, where Joe Looney has filled in all season with four-time Pro Bowler Travis Frederick battling a nerve disorder. The likely candidate to join the group is backup center Adam Redmond, who has done some work in practice at guard in practice. ... Garrett indicated LB Sean Lee will have another extended absence after re-injuring a hamstring. Lee missed three games earlier this year with the same injury.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The 20-year-old midfielder has missed games because of injuries and wanting at times to concentrate on his career at Borussia Dortmund in Germany.\n\nSarachan has given debuts to 22 players in 10 matches since taking over when Bruce Arena quit after the defeat in Trinidad, but last month he brought back the 31-year-old Bradley and 34-year-old goalkeeper Brad Guzan. Sarachan kept Guzan for these games but didn't see a need for Bradley.\n\n\"Having earned 142 caps, his need for these games is far less important than it would be for players with less experience,\" Sarachan said. \"Secondly, Michael's schedule the past two years with Toronto FC has been virtually nonstop and he has largely played without a break.\"\n\nRomain Gall, a 23-year-old midfielder with Sweden's Malmo, is the lone player on the roster with no international experience.\n\nThese are the last matches this year for the Americans.
